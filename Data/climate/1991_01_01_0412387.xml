        <p>The old year is barely out the door, and already the record-keepers are saying it was one for the books: 1990 was New York City's warmest year.</p>
        <p>On a day when see-your-breath cold whistled into the metropolitan region and temperatures plunged from the sweaters-off 60's to the zipped-up 20's, that was news to the rainbow-colored parkas and shivering bare-legged joggers in Central Park, where the Weather Service has been taking the city's temperature since 1869.</p>
        <p>"You think this is warm?" said Calvin Roane, a Transit Authority dispatcher whose daily rounds take him to the bus stop at 72d Street and Central Park West.</p>
        <p>The forecasters did, relatively speaking, which is usually the only way forecasters speak. The National Weather Service said that 1990 broke the record for the average temperature in Central Park. It was one of the nation's warmest years, too, with a record also set in Washington, the Weather Service said. The nationwide figures for 1990 have yet to be compiled, but David Miskus, a meteorologist for the National Climate Analysis Center, said that 1990 could come close to the record-breaking years of 1932 and 1921.</p>
        <p>"It never really got cold out," Mr. Miskus said. "The cold air never came down."</p>
        <p>The Weather Service said it would have taken a lot more than yesterday's chill to keep 1990 from breaking the old record for warmth in Central Park, set in 1953 -- a plunge to 16 below would have done the trick. The mercury did fall yesterday, but not by that much. At midnight it was down to 27.</p>
        <p>After some year-end number-crunching at the New York area forecast office in Rockefeller Center, the Weather Service said that the average temperature in Central Park in 1990 was 57.2 degrees. The average in 1953 was 57 degrees. The average in a typical year is 54.5.</p>
        <p>Somehow, though, it was not a boffo heat wave -- not like Ethel Merman belting out the old Irving Berlin song, or Linda Ronstadt bouncing through a generations-later tune with the same title. Rather, 1990 was a year that started out warm -- not hot, not cold -- and stayed that way. It was a year of relatively few extreme temperatures. In New York, the coldest day of the year was Feb. 26, when the temperature dipped to 7 degrees -- not the coldest it has ever been. The warmest was July 5, when it surged to 95 -- not the warmest either.</p>
        <p>Climate experts said it was too early to determine whether the 1990 temperatures were the result of global warming, the so-called greenhouse effect. But even before the year was out, the experts were toting up the results of so many warm days.</p>
        <p>Right in Central Park it took more electricity than usual to keep the skating rinks frozen. Ornithologists, entomologists and other kinds of -ologists say the warm weather may mean a population increase this year for park creatures like birds, butterflies and rats.</p>
        <p>"This winter's felt like an Oregon winter," said Jane Abbruzzese, a legal assistant, who was running in Central Park yesterday, "and I'm from there. I don't like cold winters."</p>
        <p>Another measure of how warm the weather has been is degree days, the climatologists' equivalent of the Dow Jones industrial average. A degree day is a unit that fuel suppliers, landlords and others concerned with heating depend on. The number of degree days is figured by subtracting each day's average temperature from 65 degrees -- the colder the weather, the more degree days. As of midnight, for example, the average temperature was 44 degrees, so the degree-day count for the year rose by 21.  Birds Are Confused</p>
        <p>As of yesterday, the degree-day count for the winter so far was 1350, compared with 2049 at the end of 1989 and 1703 at the same point in a typical winter.</p>
        <p>That means that the current winter is 353 degree days, or about 21 percent, warmer than usual.</p>
        <p>"Soon we won't be able to tell summer from winter," said Mr. Roane, the bus dispatcher. "Where I live in Queens, the trees are budding. The weather's fooling nature."</p>
        <p>For once, the weather may even be for the birds. A couple of unexpected creatures were seen when the Audubon Society raised its binoculars and began its annual Christmas bird count last month. One was a black-and-white warbler, an insect-eater that is usually somewhere in the South by this time of year. The other was a Western tanager.</p>
        <p>"This bird was really lost," said Norman Stotz, a board member of the New York City Audubon Society. "They're normally found in California. When the weather turned quite cold the middle of this past week, unfortunately, I'm told that it moved across the street to the Museum of Natural History, because it was killed by the cold."  Business Perspective</p>
        <p>In a heat wave, ice takes on the must-have importance of a basic necessity. But despite the high average temperature, Mike Ferraro watched his hopes for a bonanza in 1990, well, melt away.</p>
        <p>"It was warmer but that didn't help us any," said Mr. Ferraro, the third-generation proprietor of the United City Ice Cube Company in Manhattan. "In this business you've got to know the weather. Twenty degrees here or there can make you or break you.</p>
        <p>"When it's real cold nobody needs ice, so you hope for a warmer winter. But the restaurant business is hurting and when the restaurant business hurts, we hurt despite the fact that it was warmer."</p>
