        <p>Though no one knows just what agonies have befallen the men on the Russian submarine Kursk, other seamen who have been trapped beneath the sea describe how quickly the air can turn toxic and serious physical and emotional deterioration can set in.</p>
        <p>The classic image of the dangers of submarine warfare has come from movies like ''Das Boot,'' where men huddle quietly together to try to ride out depth-charge attacks and keep their hopes alive.</p>
        <p>But as Russian officials spoke with fading hope yesterday of recovering the men on the Kursk, both Russians and Americans who have been aboard other stricken submarines, including some cornered in cold war confrontations, said headaches were common within a day as the air grew foul. And many men began gasping for breath and taking to their bunks with throbbing head pain by the second or third day as rising levels of deadly carbon dioxide began to consume them.</p>
        <p>''By the second morning, some of us were kind of numb,'' said Clifford A. Smith, who was aboard a diesel-powered submarine that was forced by Soviet forces to go without fresh air for three days on a spy mission in the 1950's. He said the conditions were probably very similar to those  on the hobbled Kursk, which is no longer able to produce its own fresh air.</p>
        <p>Even though the lights were dimmed and special chemicals were scattered to absorb some of the carbon dioxide, Mr. Smith said, the crew's condition became so desperate that the submarine's captain was forced to surface -- and allow Soviet forces to herd his vessel away from their coast.</p>
        <p>And in 1981, former submariners  say, one American sailor had to be sedated when a spy submarine that he was aboard became temporarily stuck in sand in the seabed in Soviet water.</p>
        <p>It is not known how many of the  118 crew members of the Kursk survived the initial catastrophe that led to its sinking last Saturday, and Russian navy commanders said yesterday that they did not know how many were still alive, if any.</p>
        <p>Russian officials have said that an explosion, possibly involving one of the Kursk's torpedoes, may have ripped a hole in the front of the submarine, allowing water to flood several compartments and send the vessel spiraling to the bottom.</p>
        <p>Many international experts think that any air left in the submarine  may have turned poisonous by now and that nearly everyone who survived the explosion and flooding has probably been overcome by the buildup of gases like carbon dioxide, which everyone exhales.</p>
        <p>One of those experts, Rear Adm. Georgi G. Kostov, an instructor at Russia's naval academy, said yesterday that it was possible that some crewmen could still be huddled at the rear of the vessel. But even in describing the best-case situation, he painted a picture of an increasingly dank and choking environment that would soon break even the bravest and most resilient sailor.</p>
        <p>The admiral said that if any crew members were still alive, they would be very cold as the near-freezing water of the Barents Sea undoubtedly has turned the submarine into a giant refrigerator. He also said the men would be getting ''sleepy, going into a dormant state.''</p>
        <p>Admiral Kostov said they would still have food and possibly flashlights. They might also have been able to burn some special candles that give off oxygen. But he said ''the oxygen is running out with every hour.''</p>
        <p>He also said that because most of the crew members were highly experienced, ''I think they are calm and don't lose hope.''</p>
        <p>But a look at several other disasters and close calls involving submarines shows how little room there is for error in safeguarding men caught in ocean depths that many experts describe as every bit as treacherous -- and unforgiving -- as outer space.</p>
        <p>In many ways the Russians' efforts to retrieve any survivors on the Kursk with a giant diving bell most closely resemble what happened after an American submarine, the  Squalus, sank in 1939.</p>
        <p>Carl Bryson, 82, who now lives in New London, Conn., recalled in an interview yesterday that he was trapped on the Squalus for some 36 hours in 240 feet of water. What he remembers is cold, foul-smelling air and the fear he tried to tamp down inside him.</p>
        <p>Another Squalus survivor, Gerald McLees of Portsmouth, N.H., said the crew remained calm, with ''no hysterics or anything like that,'' in the pitch blackness.</p>
        <p>''I got in a bunk, covered up and tried to sleep,'' Mr. McLees, now 85, recalled. He said he was just following orders and trying to conserve oxygen by limiting his movements.</p>
        <p>In World War II, many submarines went down, some with crews terrorized through relentless depth-charge attacks. Physicians say that some of the ways that men die on submarines -- like drowning or gas poisoning -- are exceptionally painful.</p>
        <p>Once diesel submarines began being used for spy missions in the cold war, their crews also were vulnerable to being trapped.</p>
        <p>While nuclear-powered submarines can create their own air when their reactors are running, diesel submarines had to stick a pipe above the waves each night to bring fresh air into the boat.</p>
        <p>So in the case of Mr. Smith's submarine, the Gudgeon, and a few others, Soviet naval forces were able to keep them from ventilating, creating conditions over one to three days that would have been similar to those  faced by any survivors aboard the Kursk.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith, 63, who now lives in North Fork, Calif., said the men aboard the Gudgeon kept up their spirits through a determination to survive.</p>
        <p>In 1981, after a nuclear-powered American submarine, the Seawolf, sneaked into the Sea of Okhotsk on an extraordinarily secret mission -- to tap an underwater communications cable and retrieve pieces of Soviet missiles -- it was stuck in the sand for nearly two days before it could power its way off the seabed.  Some former crew members said one enlisted man lost control and began screaming. A medic was ordered to sedate him.</p>
        <p>What has made the Kursk crisis so unusual and suspenseful is that the submarine sank in relatively shallow water. Other submarines that have been lost in the nuclear era, including two American submarines, have plunged more than 10,000 feet into the depths.</p>
        <p>Rather than have any hope of rescue, these men died nearly instantaneously when their vessels imploded from the crushing sea pressures.</p>
