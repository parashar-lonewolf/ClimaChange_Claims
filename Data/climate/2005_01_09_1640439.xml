        <p>THE NEOCON NOVEL: The best book-related feature in any of this planet's English-language newspapers is surely ''The Digested Read,'' which appears in The Guardian of London. The premise of ''The Digested Read'' is pretty straightforward. Each week, The Guardian asks a writer to regurgitate the contents of a newly published book in 500 words or so, preferably in the style of its author. A few weeks ago, Michael Crichton's new novel, ''State of Fear,'' was fed through The Guardian's microcompressor, and the results were predictably hilarious. (One bit of dialogue went like this: '' 'Give me Morton's money,' yelled Drake. 'I can't,' replied Peter. 'His estate is in probate.' '') ''State of Fear'' seeks to debunk climatologists' dire predictions about global warming, and the book includes appendixes, a hefty bibliography and an author's note that bolster the book's arguments. The Guardian had even more fun with this material, capturing Crichton's tone this way: ''I'm very, very clever and have read a lot and you're all stupid wishy-washy liberals.'' Is Crichton's book, as Steve Wasserman has claimed in The Los Angeles Times, ''the first neocon novel''? Seems unlikely. Either way, ''State of Fear'' has certainly not been hurt by the controversy it has generated. The book is No. 3 on this week's hardcover fiction list. On ABC's ''20/20,'' Crichton had to dodge John Stossel's attempts to kick up even more dust. ''What's with the four wives?'' Stossel asked the frequently divorced writer. To which Crichton replied: ''Where I come from, in Hollywood, four wives is sort of like the average. . . . I'm halfway to Mickey Rooney.''</p>
        <p>THE RIGHT HISTORY: It is possible to imagine a reader polishing off Michael Crichton's novel, cracking his knuckles and thinking to himself, ''That was some fine neocon fiction, but what I really want is a neocon retelling of this country's back story.'' That reader should turn his attention to Thomas E. Woods Jr.'s new book, ''The Politically Incorrect Guide to American History,'' which is No. 15 on this week's paperback nonfiction list. Woods, who teaches at Suffolk County Community College in New York, argues that most American history courses these days teach kids only ''a series of drearily predictable clichés.'' He tries to right these wrongs by explaining why the colonists were true conservatives, why the Civil War wasn't necessary to free the slaves and why Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal was a fiasco. (Woods goes on to skewer the Brown v. Board of Education decision, Medicare, Medicaid and, of course, the presidency of Bill Clinton.) When Woods really gets going, he lets his inner Scrooge fly with impressive brio: ''It is heartwarming,'' he writes, ''to recall a time in American history when programs such as those of the New Deal were actually criticized on constitutional grounds.'' Ah, those were the days.</p>
