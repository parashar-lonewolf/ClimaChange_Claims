        <p>PROBING the glacial depths of Antarctica with radio and seismic waves, scientists have mapped the locations of more than 70 lakes that lie buried under thousands of feet of ice. The largest of these, some 140 miles long and 30 miles wide, is a body of apparently fresh water more than two miles beneath the ice, next to Russia's Vostok research base in East Antarctica.</p>
        <p>The existence of the subglacial Lake Vostok has been known for two decades, but only recently have its vast dimensions been determined and its potential importance to science been recognized. Some researchers suspect that the lake's  pristine waters contain living "fossil" microbes, bacteria and viruses essentially unchanged over as much as a million years.</p>
        <p>But as eager as scientists are to sample these organisms, they are at a loss to figure out how to do it without contaminating the lake in the process. An international group of scientists, meeting last year at Cambridge University in  England, agreed on the value of sampling the lake, but stressed the need to conduct a thorough study of how to drill to the water and prepare an environmental impact assessment of the project. One possibility, the scientists  said, would be to test sampling techniques at a smaller lake before starting work at Lake Vostok.</p>
        <p>At a conference two weeks ago in Utrecht, in the Netherlands, representatives of the nations involved in Antarctic research endorsed the Cambridge group's recommendations and adopted a resolution urging Russia to halt its planned ice coring at the Vostok station at a safe distance -- no closer than 75 to 150 feet -- above the subglacial lake to avoid any risk of polluting it. Participants at  the conference said the Russians and their French and American partners in the drilling project were expected to take these precautions when work resumes later this year.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview last week, Dr. David L. Clark, a geologist at the University of Wisconsin at Madison who is chairman of the Polar Research Board of the National Academy of Sciences, said, "The Russians are keenly aware of the fact that this is a unique fossil lake."</p>
        <p>Dr. Julie M. Palais, director of the Antarctic Glaciology Program at the National Science Foundation, said there were no plans so far for sampling the lake's waters, but proposals from scientists could be expected soon. The foundation coordinates and finances American research in Antarctica.</p>
        <p>The Russian drilling program is the most ambitious ever undertaken in Antarctica, collecting ice samples to study climate change over the ages. Russian scientists reported at Utrecht that over 20 years they had reached depths of more than two miles. During the 1995-96 research season, they penetrated within 1,500 feet of the lake. French scientists who analyzed the deepest ice samples said they were as old as 420,000 years. This has led to estimates that Lake Vostok has been sealed under the ice for at least 500,000 years, perhaps as much as a million years.</p>
        <p>Seismic studies by the Russians indicate that the lake water could be more than 2,000 feet deep, with bottom sediments about 500 feet deep at one end. The  Russians said the lake basin could be a rift valley, a deep split in the earth's crust.</p>
        <p>Dr. Michael Bender, an oceanographer at the University of Rhode Island who specializes in Antarctic research, said that heat from the earth's interior could be keeping the deep waters from freezing. Although radio-echo sounding sensitive to the slightest changes in density suggest that the water is fresh, some scientists raise the possibility that it could be ancient sea water that was trapped long ago in the basin.</p>
        <p>The charting of subglacial lakes has mainly been done by British scientists flying radio-sounding instruments on United States Navy planes. With one-third of the continent surveyed, about 70 lakes have been detected, most of them at least 9,000 feet beneath the surface and a few miles wide and up to 40 miles long.</p>
