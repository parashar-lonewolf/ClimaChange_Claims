        <p>(Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>TRIESTE AND THE MEANING OF NOWHERE, by Jan Morris. (Simon &amp; Schuster, $23.) An account both personal and historical of the heterogeneous corner of Italy that attracted James Joyce, Italo Svevo and Morris herself, partly because of the pleasurable melancholy she calls ''the Trieste effect.''</p>
        <p>THE COMPLETE WORKS OF ISAAC BABEL, edited by Nathalie Babel. (Norton, $39.95.) The total product of the marvelous writer who tried to create a synthesis of the Russian, the Jewish, the literary and the revolutionary, a mix that bestowed life on his fiction but could not save him from death on Stalin's orders in 1940.</p>
        <p>UNCLE TUNGSTEN: Memories of a Chemical Boyhood, by Oliver Sacks. (Knopf, $25.) A fresh, joyous, wistful, generous, tough-minded memoir about discovering, with the aid of a brilliant extended family, what the human mind is up to in its discernment of pattern and organization in what first looks like the arbitrary jungle of nature; in other words, science.</p>
        <p>DEATH AND THE PENGUIN, by Andrey Kurkov. (Harvill/Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, paper, $13.) Perversity and capriciousness dominate Ukraine in Kurkov's first novel to be published in English; its hero, a writer of obituaries for people who aren't dead, adopts a penguin whose fate is linked to that of the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>NO SAINTS OR ANGELS, by Ivan Klima. (Grove, $24.) The personal and the political are inseparable in Klima's newest novel, in which a Prague dentist, daughter of a zealous bureaucrat of the former regime, determines that the hate mail she has been receiving originates with a half brother previously unknown to her.</p>
        <p>AUSTERLITZ, by W. G. Sebald. (Random House, $25.95.) A middle-aged Welsh architectural historian discovers that he is really the son of Holocaust victims from Czechoslovakia in this rich, gloomy novel by a writer who has specialized in characters crippled by the past.</p>
        <p>THIS COLD HEAVEN: Seven Seasons in Greenland, by Gretel Ehrlich. (Pantheon, $27.50.) A remarkable and affectionate portrait of the Inuit Greenlanders during a time of unsettling transition, when a subsistence culture passed on by tradition is threatened by global warming, snowmobiles and the choice between formal education and unemployment.</p>
        <p>CHURCHILL: A Biography, by Roy Jenkins. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $40.) A thick single volume that aims to capture not just the familiar span of Britain's gritty resistance to Hitler but the entire life, romantically and dramatically lived, of the leader Isaiah Berlin called ''the largest human being of our time.''</p>
        <p>THE ROYAL PHYSICIAN'S VISIT, by Per Olov Enquist. (Overlook, $26.95.) A fast-paced historical novel ringing with the clash of ideas, set in the Danish court in the 1770's, when the young King Christian VII was dominated by his German physician, a fan of the French Enlightenment who tried to transform Denmark into a land of liberty, equality and fraternity; by a veteran Swedish novelist and playwright.</p>
