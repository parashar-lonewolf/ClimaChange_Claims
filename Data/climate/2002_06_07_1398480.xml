        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Just How Far Can Trading of Emissions Be Extended?'' (Business Day, May 31) says the Clear Skies proposal to reduce emissions from power plants ''would eliminate some safeguards against local hot spots'' and thus cause localized areas of unhealthy air.</p>
        <p>Clear Skies does not change E.P.A. established federal air quality standards for local areas. States will continue to have the obligation to impose additional controls on any power plant that creates any ''hot spot'' that exceeds these standards.</p>
        <p>Studies by various environmental organizations conclude that the acid rain program (upon which Clear Skies is patterned) has not created any hot spots.</p>
        <p>In fact, they conclude that trading has led the largest polluters to clean up the most and thus cooled the hottest spots of all.</p>
