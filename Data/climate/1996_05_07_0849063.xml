        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"At the Pumps, High-Octane Pain" (news article, May 3) is disappointing. In spite of your descriptions of a truck driver torn from his family and children forced "to ante up a little extra" by an ice-cream vendor feeling the pinch, I was unmoved.</p>
        <p>You frame the problem of gas prices as a power imbalance between corporations and consumers.  You suggest that the American middle class has suffered from paying a little extra at the pump.</p>
        <p>But even as some wasteful car owners grudgingly acknowledge, we cannot continue our present consumption. Like the trucker in your article, I know many  drivers who talk about the shortage of fossil fuels and get in their cars to drive five blocks to the store. I would love to see the cost of gas rise to the  European price of $4 a gallon. Maybe then talk won't be so cheap.</p>
