        <p>Previews and Openings</p>
        <p>'BILLY CONNOLLY LIVE!' Previews start Tuesday. Opens Thursday.

        <p>'BRUNDIBAR' and 'BUT THE GIRAFFE, A CURTAIN RAISER TO HANS KRASA'S 'BRUNDIBAR' In previews. Opens Sunday. Tony Kushner has written a new adaptation of Hans Krasa's World War II-era libretto about a brother and a sister who join forces with three talking animals to outwit a sinister organ grinder.

        <p>'CAGE LOVE' Previews start Wednesday. Opens May 15.

Rattlestick Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444.</p>
        <p>'THE CAINE MUTINY COURT-MARTIAL' In previews. Opens Sunday.

        <p>'DEFYING HITLER' In previews. Opens Sunday. Developed at the Royal National Theater in London, where it was performed as a companion piece to Michael Frayn's ''Democracy,'' this adaptation of the memoirs of Sebastian Haffner is about a German growing up between the two world wars. Part of the Brits Off Broadway festival (1:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200.</p>

        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>* 'AWAKE AND SING!' Dreams and disappointments, hopes and fears, encouraging words and bitter put-downs clash by day and night in Clifford Odets's turbulent comedy-drama about a Jewish family struggling to stay afloat in the 1930's. A gifted roster of performers -- including Mark Ruffalo, Lauren Ambrose, Zoë Wanamaker and Ben Gazzara -- manage to locate the dreaming centers of their characters, buried beneath layers of political sloganeering, everyday gripes or street slang. And even when the focus occasionally blurs in Bartlett Sher's ultimately moving revival, Odets's zesty dialogue is a joy to hear (2:30). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'BAREFOOT IN THE PARK' For a work that celebrates the liberating force of spontaneity, this revival of Neil Simon's 1963 comedy doesn't have one scene that feels organic, let alone impromptu. Directed by Scott Elliott, and starring Patrick Wilson and a miscast Amanda Peet as newlyweds in Greenwich Village, this ''Barefoot'' has the robotic gait of Frankenstein's monster (2:20). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'BRIDGE &amp; TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the stand-outs in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'FESTEN' An intensely staged, indifferently acted production of David Eldridge's adaptation of a 1998 Danish film about a grim family reunion, which was a big hit in London under the same director, Rufus Norris. While the mise en scène remains unsettlingly stark, the Broadway cast (which includes Michael Hayden, Julianna Margulies, Jeremy Sisto and Ali MacGraw) registers the tension and testiness of people suffering from a collective bad hair day. Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'HOT FEET' A dancing encyclopedia of clichés set to the music of Earth, Wind and Fire. Numbing (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'LESTAT' A musical sleeping pill, adapted from Anne Rice's ''Vampire Chronicles'' and featuring songs by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, that could well give the makers of Ambien a run for their money. Dare to look upon this tale of the undead and keep your eyelids from growing heavier and heavier and heavier (2:30). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, near 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE PAJAMA GAME'  Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THREE DAYS OF RAIN'  (2:30). In this revival of Richard Greenberg's slender, elegant drama of family disconnectedness, Julia Roberts is stiff with self-consciousness, glancingly acquainted with the two characters she plays and deeply, disturbingly beautiful. Otherwise, it is almost impossible to discern the virtues of the play itself in this wooden and splintered production, directed by Joe Mantello and also starring Paul Rudd and Bradley Cooper, who have little chance of capturing the audience's attention (2:30). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE THREEPENNY OPERA' Presented as a long, pansexual orgy, Scott Elliot's numbing revival of the Brecht-Weill classic feels like a party where the hangover begins almost as soon as the evening does. The starry cast includes Alan Cumming (as Mac the Knife) and a Dietrich-like Cyndi Lauper, though only Jim Dale and Nellie McKay appear to have a clue as to what the show is about (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE WEDDING SINGER'  An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotes from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'WELL' Lisa Kron's sparkling autobiographical play about illness, integration and her mother (portrayed with majestic warmth and weariness by Jayne Houdyshell) helps restore the honor of that tarnished literary form, the memoir. Though it shows the strain of scaling up for Broadway, this singular work, which stars Ms. Kron as herself, opens windows of insight and emotion found in no other show (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'ASSISTED LOVING' This warm and witty monologue by Bob Morris, who contributes the Age of Dissonance column to the Sunday Styles section of The New York Times, is performed by the author, who chronicles his widowed father's and his own search for love in and around New York. Engaging, subtle and winning (1:10). Daryl Roth Theater, D-Lounge, 103 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200. (George Hunka)</p>
        <p>'BASED ON A TOTALLY TRUE STORY' A chatty, autobiographical comedy by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa about a writer for comic books who moonlights as a screenwriter and playwright. Juggling his two jobs, the busy writer begins backsliding in his unofficial third, ''being a loving, giving, emotionally available boyfriend.'' Minor-key angst ensues in this perky two hours of comic navel-gazing (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE CONTRAST' Royall Tyler's slender 1787 romantic comedy -- one of the first professional American plays ever produced -- should be of more interest to historians than to theatergoers (2:30). Theater at St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Jason Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'DEFIANCE' The second in John Patrick Shanley's cycle of morality plays that began with ''Doubt,'' this ambitious tale of racial relations and the military mindset on a North Carolina marine base feels both overcrowded and oddly diffuse. If ''Doubt'' has an elegant and energy-efficient sprinter's gait, ''Defiance'' progresses with a flustered air of distraction. The excellent Margaret Colin, as an officer's wife, provides a welcome shot of credibility (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, Theater 1, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'ENTERTAINING MR. SLOANE' Scott Ellis's underpowered production of Joe Orton's great farce of sexual hypocrisy, which stars Alec Baldwin in a comedy sketch of a performance, is breezy, often funny and rarely convincing. (2:00). Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'GEORGE M. COHAN TONIGHT!'  The all-singing, all-dancing Jon Peterson summons the spirit of this legendary Broadway entertainer in this engaging one-man musical, devised and directed by Chip Deffaa (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Hunka)</p>
        <p>'GUARDIANS'  Peter Morris's play juxtaposes the moral decline of two disparate characters caught up in the destructive tailwinds of the American invasion of Iraq: a cold-blooded tabloid journalist in London and a soldier in the United States Army. Lee Pace and Katherine Moennig give persuasive performances as the sleazy hack and the scapegoated grunt, but Mr. Morris's play is more flashily provocative than truly thoughtful (1:30). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'I LOVE YOU BECAUSE'  The plotline -- single New Yorkers in search of love -- couldn't be more familiar, but somehow this fluffy, funny musical makes it refreshing, helped along by an engaging six-member cast, with David A. Austin making a particularly hilarious impression. An impressive start for Ryan Cunningham (book and lyrics) and Joshua Salzman (music), both still in their 20's (2:00). Village Theater, 158 Bleecker Street, near Sullivan Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100. (Neil Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>'THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST'  Lynn Redgrave is an unusually vigorous Lady Bracknell in Sir Peter Hall's new production of Oscar Wilde's peerless comedy from 1895. A satisfactory production that works effectively as a romantic farce but more erratically as a vehicle for Wilde's paradox-perfumed wit. (2:25) Brooklyn Academy of Music, Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best. (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'LANDSCAPE OF THE BODY'  This terrific revival, directed by Michael Greif, identifies the unbearable wistfulness of being in John Guare's delirious heartbreaker of a comedy from 1977. The top-flight cast is led by Lili Taylor and Sherie Rene Scott as sisters -- one living, one a singing ghost -- who move in and out of a lyrical and sordid world where tabloid prurience has become a religion. Signature Theater's Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'RED LIGHT WINTER'  A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, this play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'SANDRA BERNHARD: EVERYTHING BAD AND BEAUTIFUL' Sandra Bernhard was a proverbial rock star long before headline-making folks in even the most prosaic walks of life were being referred to as such. Her new show, a collection of songs interspersed with musings on her life and on public figures ranging from Britney Spears to Condoleezza Rice, is casual to the point of being offhand. That said, it's invigorating to be in the presence of a true original (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, at Union Square, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'SORE THROATS' Howard Brenton's scabrous 1979 drama about the bilious aftermath of a British marriage. Laila Robins and Bill Camp are a middle-aged, newly divorced couple warring over the past and the future. The play's insights into the irreducible conflict between human needs and the constraints of civilization are a little murky (2:10). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'STUFF HAPPENS'  Daniel Sullivan's sharp, invigorating production of David Hare's journalistic drama about the road to war in Iraq is conducted on the modest scale of a town-hall meeting. The characters (who have names like Bush and Blair) seem less like destiny-shaping gods than the ego trippers in your office. If that means they're too close for comfort, then ''Stuff Happens'' is doing its job (2:50). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'TRYST' A suspense drama of a distinctly old-fashioned stamp about the romance between a handsome cad (Maxwell Caulfield) and a lonely spinster (Amelia Campbell). Will the wily predator seduce and abandon the mousy milliner? Karoline Leach's play springs a few twists that lack psychological credibility but keep the plot on the boil (2:00). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>Off Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'ADVENTURES OF CAVEMAN ROBOT: THE MUSICAL' A disjointed but vivid homage and musical parody, by Jeff Lewonczyk and Debby Schwartz, of comic books and superheroes. Sloppy and long, too (2:10). Brick Theater, 575 Metropolitan Avenue, at Lorimer Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 907-3457. (Hunka)</p>
        <p>Long-Running Shows</p>
        <p>'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) John Patrick Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions in the clash between the head of a parochial school and the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>

        <p>'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20).

        <p>'MACRUNE'S GUEVARA' The Young Mirror arm of Mirror Repertory revives John Spurling's odd 1969 play about an artist who left behind a wall full of drawings of Che Guevara, and the man who saw something profound in them. Parts of the play read today like a funny sendup of art critics who see too much brilliance in outsider-art gibberish; other parts seem a bit like gibberish of their own (2:15). St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444; closing Wednesday. (Genzlinger)</p>

        <p>'AKEELAH AND THE BEE' (PG, 112 minutes) Eleven-year-old Akeelah Anderson (Keke Palmer) is a bright but unmotivated girl who can outspell anyone at her South Los Angeles middle school. When Akeelah gets a taste of victory by winning the school bee, she throws herself into studying for the regional one, coached by a stern English professor named Joshua Larabee (Laurence Fishburne). But Akeelah's mother (Angela Bassett) objects to her daughter's obsession with what she considers a ''game.'' The innate suspense and charm of the spelling bee, along with a trio of crack performances, turn what is, in essence, a formulaic picture into something more satisfying: an underdog tale that manages to inspire without being sappy. (Dana Stevens)</p>
        <p>* 'CLEAN' (R, 110 minutes) This fine French movie, written and directed by Olivier Assayas, is one of the few fictional films to evoke realistically the grubby texture of existence for second- and third-tier rock celebrities crumbling under a combination of fading renown and drug addiction. Maggie Cheung and Nick Nolte offer memorable portrayals as a recovering junkie and her compassionate father-in-law. (Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'THE DEATH OF MR. LAZARESCU' (R, 154 minutes, in Romanian) This Romanian film follows the grueling final hours of an ailing, alcoholic 62-year-old man in Bucharest, as he is shuttled among four city hospitals. A sustained triumph of ensemble acting, the film seems so absolutely real that it absorbs you into its world in the same way that a documentary like Frederick Wiseman's ''Hospital'' seeps into your consciousness.(Holden)</p>
        <p>'GUYS AND BALLS' (R, 106 minutes, in German) In the German soccer comedy ''Guys and Balls,'' a baker's son (Maximilian Brückner) who is gay forms an all-gay team to defeat his hometown homophobes. Groaning with double-entendres and flaming gay stereotypes, the movie's climactic game offers some of the most sustained -- and literal -- gay bashing in movie history, even if the outcome is no more surprising than that of any other underdog comedy. Adam Sandler is probably already in training.(Jeannette Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'HOW I KILLED A SAINT' (No rating, 82 minutes, in Macedonian and English) Set in Macedonia during the 2001 civil conflict with the country's ethnic Albanians, ''How I Killed a Saint'' views the crisis through the eyes of two deeply troubled siblings. Filmed in a covert, voyeuristic style that's virtually devoid of close-ups, the movie successfully conveys the pervasive anxiety of a country teetering on the brink of civil war. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'ICE AGE: THE MELTDOWN' (PG, 93 minutes) Creative exhaustion haunts ''Ice Age: The Meltdown,'' as the characters from 2002's ''Ice Age'' face global warming and the submersion of their valley. While the animals head for safety in a giant, arklike boat, the director, Carlos Saldanha, indulges in biblical imagery and bad science. Over all, a flat and uninspired follow-up to a vastly superior movie. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'INSIDE MAN' (R, 128 minutes) The latest from Spike Lee takes a familiar setup -- a Wall Street bank heist that mutates into a hostage crisis -- and twists it ever so slightly and nicely. Among the film's most sustained pleasures are its holy trinity -- Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster -- and the best lineup of pusses and mugs outside ''The Sopranos.'' (Manohla Dargis)</p>
        <p>'LADY VENGEANCE' (R, 111 minutes, in Korean) Park Chanwook completes his ''vengeance trilogy'' with this kinder, gentler exercise in pulp pyrotechnics and empty virtuosity. (Nathan Lee)</p>
        <p>* 'L'ENFANT (THE CHILD)' (R, 100 minutes, in French) The latest from the Belgian brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne involves a young thief (Jérémie Renier) who one day sells his newborn son for a fat envelope of cash. What interests the Dardennes -- what invests their work with such terrific urgency -- is not only how a man would sell a child as casually as a slab of beef, but also whether a man like this, having committed such a repellent offense, can find redemption. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'THE LOST CITY' (R, 143 minutes) Andy Garcia's ode to the Havana of pre-Communist Cuba is a romantic epic manqué that swoons across the screen for nearly 2 1/2 hours without saying much beyond the fact that life sure was peachy before Fidel Castro came to town and ruined everything. (Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE' (R, 91 minutes) With the help of her charmingly enthusiastic star, Gretchen Mol, the director Mary Harron unwraps the great 1950's pinup queen Bettie Page, who for years was a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside a web of expertly tied rope. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'SCARY MOVIE 4' (PG-13, 83 minutes) This parasitic franchise is back to feed on last year's disposable distractions, proving, if nothing else, that there's a laugh or two left in ''Brokeback Mountain'' parodies and Viagra overdoses. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'RV' (PG, 102 minutes) Nowadays, no family movie is complete without a values-oriented agenda and a bountiful supply of fecal matter, and ''RV'' supplies both. Robin Williams is an overworked executive trying to reconnect with his family on a mobile-home vacation. Barry Sonnenfeld directs with one eye on the production and the other on the clock, producing a movie that feels as clapped-out as the titular vehicle itself. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'THE SENTINEL' (PG-13, 108 minutes) The question is why: why would a star of Michael Douglas's stature and obvious intelligence attach himself to a Washington thriller as deeply ridiculous, suspense-free and potentially career-damaging as ''The Sentinel''? (Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'SIR! NO SIR!' (No rating, 84 minutes) In this smart, very timely documentary, the filmmaker David Zeiger revisits one of the memorable and least revisited chapters of the Vietnam War, the antiwar movement inside the military.(Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'STICK IT' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Somersaulting through happy clichés and unexpected invention, this spry teenage comedy gets everything right. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'SUITE HABANA' (No rating, 80 minutes, in Spanish) Fernando Pérez tracks a day in 10 ordinary lives in Havana. It may not be a representative portrait of the city, but its most compelling subjects, especially a widower and his disabled son, linger in the mind. (Neil Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>'Thank You for Smoking' (R, 92 minutes) The director Jason Reitman has made a glib and funny movie from Christopher Buckley's glib and funny novel about a Big Tobacco lobbyist, but the real attraction here is the hard-working star, Aaron Eckhart. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'WATER' (PG-13, 114 minutes, in Hindi) Set in India in 1938, ''Water'' focuses on a group of widows condemned by Hindu law to live in an institution on the banks of the River Ganges. The arrival of a high-spirited 8-year-old girl encourages one widow to question her faith and another to begin a love affair with a Gandhian idealist. Bobbing back and forth between romantic melodrama and spiritual inquiry, ''Water'' is an exquisitely beautiful film about the institutionalized oppression of an entire class of women. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'THE WHORE'S SON' (No rating, 86 minutes, in German) Michael Sturminger's unsentimental German-language debut feature fearlessly plumbs the depths of an intense mother-son relationship, in which Ozren (appearing at ages 3, 8 and 16) becomes more aware, as the years pass, that his beloved mother, Silvija, is a high-class prostitute. (Laura Kern)</p>
        <p>'THE WILD' (G, 94 minutes) Filled with softness and texture, ''The Wild'' follows Samson the lion (voiced by Kiefer Sutherland) as he escapes from the zoo to rescue his cub, who has stowed away on a ship bound for Africa. With inspired voice work from Eddie Izzard as a pukka koala and William Shatner as a menacing wildebeest, the movie also finds time to explore the travails of single fatherhood and the evils of oppression. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>Film Series</p>
        <p>ROBERT ALTMAN (Through June 8) The Museum of the Moving Image's 22-film retrospective of Mr. Altman's work continues this weekend with features including ''Thieves Like Us'' (1974), starring Keith Carradine and Shelley Duvall as Bonnie and Clyde types; ''Secret Honor'' (1983), with Philip Baker Hall as Richard M.

(Anita Gates)</p>
        <p>B-NOIR (Through June 15) Film Forum's six-week festival of 70 low-budget American thrillers from the 1940's and 50's begins with two double features. Robert Aldrich's Mickey Spillane crime drama ''Kiss Me Deadly'' (1955), with Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer, and Stanley Kubrick's classic heist picture ''The Killing'' (1956) will be shown today and tomorrow. Two Robert Wise films, ''The Set-Up'' (1949), with Robert Ryan as an over-the-hill boxer, and ''The Captive City'' (1952), about a seemingly peaceful town under the thumb of a local tycoon and his gangsters, will be shown on Sunday. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $10. (Gates)</p>
        <p>A BRIEF ENCOUNTER WITH NOËL COWARD On Wednesdays in May, the Donnell Media Center is screening Coward films from the 1940's, his most prolific period. Next Wednesday's feature is ''In Which We Serve'' (1942), a war drama about a British destroyer, starring and directed by Coward (1899-1973). The series will also include ''This Happy Breed'' (1947), ''Blithe Spirit'' (1945) and, of course, ''Brief Encounter'' (1945). 20 West 53rd Street, (212) 621-0609; free. (Gates)</p>
        <p>THE FILMS OF MIKIO NARUSE (Through Wednesday) BAMcinématek's tribute to Naruse (1905-69), the Japanese realist filmmaker, continues this weekend with three films. ''Summer Clouds'' (1958) is about a rural war widow who has an affair with a newspaper reporter. ''Floating Clouds'' (1955) is Naruse's masterpiece about a typist and an engineer in postwar Tokyo. ''When a Woman Ascends the Stairs'' (1960) is the story of an aging bar hostess in the Ginza bar district. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates)</p>
        <p>REDISCOVERING ROSCOE: THE CAREER OF FATTY ARBUCKLE (Through May 15). The Museum of Modern Art's 54-film retrospective of the acting and directing career of the scandal-ridden Arbuckle (1887-1933) continues this weekend with a program of silent films directed by Arbuckle, including ''Fatty's Reckless Fling'' (1915) and a program of four 1917 films starring Arbuckle and Buster Keaton. (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates)</p>
        <p>THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS: DISCOVERING SYRIAN CINEMA (Through May 18) A series of Syrian features, documentaries and shorts, sponsored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center and ArteEast, begins today. This weekend's films include Oussama Mohammad's ''Stars in Broad Daylight'' (1988), a drama about a double wedding; Mohammad Malas's ''Dreams of the City'' (1983); and Abdellatif Abdul-Hamid's ''Nights of the Jackals'' (1989), about a peasant family with a neighborhood noise problem. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, (212) 875-5600; $10. (Gates)</p>

        <p>Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.</p>
        <p>BAMBOOZLE (Tomorrow and Sunday) Somehow it is appropriate that this two-day festival, a cluster of a few dozen bands with a big presence on MySpace.com, is taking the form of a huge, flat sprawl in the Meadowlands parking lots: an endless web of fans and bands blending together. Fall Out Boy headlines tomorrow, followed by, among many others, All American Rejects, Hawthorne Heights, Thursday, Mewithoutyou, Minus the Bear, Motion City Soundtrack, Relient K, Armor for Sleep, Keating, the Killing Sequence and Streetlight Manifesto. On Sunday, Taking Back Sunday headlines, with AFI, Captured by Robots, From Autumn to Ashes, Him, Moneen, Saves the Day, Panic! at the Disco, Say Anything, Poison the Well and the festival's token hip-hop star, Method Man. At 11:30 a.m., Meadowlands Sports Complex, Routes 3 and 120, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900 or (212) 307-7171; $32 both days. (Ben Sisario)</p>
        <p>BLACK LIPS, SOLDIERS OF FORTUNE (Tonight) Fresh from their appearances opening up for the Yeah Yeah Yeahs at the cavernous Roseland, the Black Lips, from Atlanta, have a gig that is more their size. The band plays a grisly version of 1960's garage rock that sounds deliberately damaged. With Soldiers of Fortune -- which includes members of the garage-metal-experimental band Oneida, Jah Division and the countryish Oakley Hall -- and Mountains of Mattalama. At 10, Place, Norman and Kingsland Avenues, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, www.toddpnyc.com; $8. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* THE BOOKS (Tonight) Nick Zammuto and Paul de Jong of the Books make beguiling electronic collages out of seemingly incongruous elements: disembodied vocal samples, a few plucks from a banjo or another string instrument, and unclassifiable noises that fade in and out like traffic. Part of the pleasure of listening to their music is trying to figure out just why it all works so wonderfully and wittily. Their performance will incorporate video as well as audio, and their opening act is the always adventurous violinist Todd Reynolds, of the string quartet Ethel. At 9, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; sold out. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>BRIAN JONESTOWN MASSACRE (Wednesday) This tuneless headache of a band, modeled on the jangly psychedelic rock of Britain and Los Angeles in the mid-1960's as well as the self-destructive persona of Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones, was on its way into obscurity when, two years ago, it was featured in a hit documentary, ''Dig!,'' and a legend was created. Since then the band has toured widely, to large audiences who wait for its leader, Anton Newcombe, to lash out in paranoia and, as he did in the film, kick a fan in the head. With the Lilys. At 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $20. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>CLEM SNIDE (Tomorrow and Monday) With a homely, nasal tenor and a few lonesome strums on his guitar, Eef Barzelay, the lead singer and chief songwriter of the band Clem Snide, can picture heartache and regret in trompe-l'oeil precision or, if the mood strikes him, simply goof off. In one song on his new solo album, ''Bitter Honey'' (SpinArt), he takes on the persona of a woman whose rear end makes an appearance in a video: ''It was on screen for a second but was kind of hard to miss.'' With Elvis Perkins, a band from Rhode Island that borrows Clem Snide's spacious sound without Mr. Barzelay's quirks. Tomorrow at 9 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. Monday at 8 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $10. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>CONCRETES (Monday) This eight-piece group from Stockholm specializes in the kind of breezy, nostalgic chamber-pop popularized by Belle and Sebastian, with hummable and carefully orchestrated hymns to innocence and sunshine. Opening the show is the Australian singer and songwriter Sally Seltmann, performing under the stage name New Buffalo. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $15. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>EVAN DANDO (Tonight) Mr. Dando, the lead heartthrob of the Lemonheads -- who by many reports did a surprisingly credible job singing with the reunited MC5 two years ago, though most fans had none of it -- plays a solo show. With the Hymns. At 8, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; $15. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* FAUN FABLES, BARBEZ (Tomorrow) On a bed of ghostly acoustic folk, Faun Fables's Dawn McCarthy and Nils Frykdahl build an astonishing and unpredictable kind of pop theater, at once grandiose and nightmarish and silly. Their new album, ''The Transit Rider'' (Drag City), is a creepily obsessive song cycle about the commuting life, which the band will perform in costume, with films and a cast of four. Barbez, from New York, finds an enticing middle ground between Kurt Weill's cabaret, droning avant-garde rock and the twinkling perpetual-motion pieces of Erik Satie. At 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>PAUL GREEN SCHOOL OF ROCK MUSIC (Tomorrow and Sunday) As seen in the documentary ''Rock School,'' Mr. Green offers an extensive rock curriculum at his school in Philadelphia, teaching youngsters the canon as well as the fundamentals of power chords and budda-budda bass lines. For three weekends this month, his students will visit CBGB to show off their mastery of the classics. The residency begins with the music of Frank Zappa, which received a spirited reading in the film. (Next are the Beatles and AC/DC.) 4 p.m., 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052; $10. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>INXS (Tonight) Last year ''Rock Star: INXS,'' the reality series on CBS, picked a new singer for the onetime hit makers of INXS, whose original singer and only recognizable member, Michael Hutchence, died in 1997. The winner was one J. D. Fortune, a former Elvis impersonator who became -- this was reality TV, remember -- a Michael Hutchence impersonator. At 8, Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171; $49.50 to $79.50. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>YUNGCHEN LHAMO (Tonight) Long exiled from Tibet, Ms. Lhamo sings tender and mournful prayers about struggle and forgiveness, set to a soothing New Age sound that incorporates foamy electronics, electric guitars and assorted world-music instruments, like the African kora. Tonight she appears with some guests from her new album, ''Ama'' (Real World), including the British singer Joy Askew. At 8, Lerner Hall Theater at Columbia University, Broadway at 115th Street, Morningside Heights, (866) 468-7619; $25; $21 for members of Tibet House; $17 for students and Tibetans. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* LIGHTNING BOLT (Sunday) At first it is hard to believe that all the glorious chaos of Lightning Bolt -- a stalwart of the big noise-punk scene in Providence, R.I. -- is being made by only two people, the bassist Brian Gibson and the drummer and vocalist Brian Chippendale. But as the sound comes into focus, a playful give-and-take becomes clear, as Mr. Gibson and Mr. Chippendale toss back and forth gigantic metal riffs and giggly high notes, creating rainbows of dissonance. This concert, before the band goes on a European tour, is a benefit for Tarantula Hill, a performance space in Baltimore that was recently damaged by a fire. Also on the bill are the Brooklyn sludge-rockers Double Leopards, the Baltimore duo Nautical Almanac and Kites, a one-man noise factory from Providence. At 7 p.m., the Hook, 18 Commerce Street, near Richards Street, Red Hook, Brooklyn, (718) 797-3007; $10. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>MASTERS OF INDIAN MUSIC (Tonight) U. Shrinivas is not only a virtuoso on the electric mandolin but also a clever innovator: he made modifications on his instrument to adapt it for the Carnatic classical style of southern India. Born in 1969, he has long bridged classical and pop styles, first as a prodigy at jazz festivals and later with John McLaughlin and his group Remember Shakti. He appears in a World Music Institute concert with his brother U. Rajesh, who also plays the mandolin. At 8, Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, (212) 545-7536; $30; $15 for students. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>MATMOS (Tonight) M. C. Schmidt and Drew Daniel of the San Francisco electronic group Matmos make music out of almost any found sounds: playing cards being shuffled, the slurping of liposuction, even melting ice. The effect can be lighthearted and playful or eerily disconcerting, as on one track on the group's latest album, ''The Rose Has Teeth in the Mouth of the Beast'' (Matador), in which robotic voices discuss ''pain in someone else's body'' over the mechanical ticking of typewriters. At 7, Whitney Museum of American Art, (800) 944-8639; free with pay-what-you-wish museum admission, but a $75 season pass to the Whitney Live series guarantees a seat. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>MINDLESS SELF INDULGENCE (Thursday) Bands merging high-adrenaline industrial rock with a carnival-of-freaks theatricality had a pretty good run in the 90's, the era of Ministry, My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult and Marilyn Manson. But fans are not ready to put away their black lipstick just yet, if the grass-roots success of this New York group is any indication. This show kicks off four nights at Avalon, two already sold out. 8 p.m., 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780 or (212) 307-7171; sold out. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>THURSTON MOORE (Wednesday) Mr. Moore, one of the guitarists in Sonic Youth and an eternal symbol of casually omnivorous eclecticism, plays two sets of improvisations, the first solo and the second with unnamed guests. 8 and 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; $10 per set. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>NORTEC COLLECTIVE (Tonight) A loose confederation of musicians and visual artists, the Nortec Collective is devoted to the cutting, rearranging and pasting of norteño -- the vibrant border style of accordions and oompah brass known on this side of the border as Tex-Mex. At midnight, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940; $15 in advance, $18 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* PELICAN, MONO (Tuesday) It's almost a misnomer to call Pelican a metal band. This four-piece instrumental group does indeed play loud, chunky power chords in the Melvins tradition, but with a sense of tragic drama that keeps the songs at a slow, reflective pace. With Mono, an instrumental group from Japan that flies from light turbulence into magnificent storms of noise. 8 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780 or (212) 307-7171; $15 in advance, $16 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>PINBACK (Tuesday and Wednesday) This band from San Diego, centered on Zach Smith and Rob Crow, makes modesty a virtue. Its songs move at deliberate speed with glimmers of twanged guitar or electronic blips; its vocals are conversational, full of disappointment and wistful hopes. With Pleaseeasaur. Tuesday at 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; sold out. Wednesday at 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $16 in advance and $18 at the door. (Jon Pareles)</p>
        <p>* JOSH RITTER, HEM (Tonight) A guileless, boy-next-door voice is the first clue that Mr. Ritter doesn't need a lot of fancy tricks to make a point. Powerfully minimal songwriting is another. But there is no limit to the depth and ambition of his songs, whether he is confessing a simple crush or following his thoughts on a long, Whitmanesque incantation, as he does for more than nine minutes on ''Thin Blue Flame'' from his new album, ''The Animal Years'' (V2). Hem plays somewhat prosaic alt-country, but in such delicate, sensuous arrangements that it doesn't matter. At 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; sold out. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>SAW DOCTORS (Thursday) The Saw Doctors sing earnest, folk-rocking anthems of small-town life ''for those who feel they've been mistreated/Discriminated, robbed or cheated.'' In Ireland their populism has brought them a huge national following; even in New York City, there should be plenty of voices with brogues singing along. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $26.50 in advance, $30 at the door. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>OBIE TRICE (Tuesday) Obie Trice emerged a few years ago as a solid protégé of Eminem; 50 Cent made his appearance around the same time, though, and most of the world forgot about Eminem's other protégés. But Mr. Trice has remained a good soldier. His new single, ''Snitch,'' is a humorless warning to a stool pigeon: ''This act is not permitted.'' Gulp! 9 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940; $15 in advance, $18 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>Cabaret</p>

        <p>* KAREN AKERS (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) This regal cabaret singer and the brassy songs of Kander and Ebb that she is offering in her new show may not be an obvious fit. But Ms. Akers locates the heart inside the brass and sass. At 9 p.m., with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 11:30, Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; cover, $60, with a $20 minimum; $60 prix fixe dinner required on Thursdays and at the early shows tonight and tomorrow. (Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday) Even when swinging out, this Lady of a Thousand Songs remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. At 2 p.m., the Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $58, including brunch at noon. (Holden)</p>
        <p>BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package. (Holden)</p>
        <p>ANNIE ROSS (Wednesday) Cool, funny, swinging and indestructible, this 75-year-old singer and sometime actress exemplifies old-time hip in its most generous incarnation. At 9:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $12 minimum. (Holden)</p>

        <p>MEMORIAL FOR DEREK BAILEY (Through May 31) The iconoclastic guitarist Derek Bailey had originally intended to perform with many of the artists he assembled for this monthlong run, which now serves as a fitting tribute. Highlights in the coming week include a percussion duo of Cyro Baptista and Billy Martin (tomorrow), an evening with the noise-rock guitarist Thurston Moore (Wednesday) and a group called Audible Means, led by the bassist Lisle Ellis (Thursday). At 8 and 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Nate Chinen)</p>
        <p>STEVEN BERNSTEIN'S MILLENNIAL TERRITORY ORCHESTRA (Thursday) Led by the slide trumpeter Steven Bernstein, this little big band dusts off an obscure swing-era repertory with showmanship and irreverence. At 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $12. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>ANDY BEY (Through Sunday) Intimacy is a hallmark of Mr. Bey's vocal style, which alternates between a rich baritone and a burnished falsetto. He's also a fine pianist, as he'll demonstrate with this quartet featuring the guitarist Paul Meyers. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25 and $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>BISHOP-CLEAVER-FLOOD (Wednesday) As on his new album, ''Time and Imaginary Time'' (Envoi), the saxophonist Andrew Bishop engages in a communicative exchange with the drummer Gerald Cleaver and the bassist Tim Flood, expanding compositional frames and exploring open space. At 10 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>GERALD CLEAVER'S VIOLET HOUR (Tomorrow) Mr. Cleaver's suggestive pulse as a drummer has served him well in both conventional and experimental settings. His less heralded compositional vision guides this project, with the trumpeter Jeremy Pelt, the saxophonists J. D. Allen and Andrew Bishop, the pianist Ben Waltzer and the bassist Chris Lightcap. At 9 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>KRIS DAVIS QUARTET (Sunday night) As on her new album, ''The Slightest Shift'' (Fresh Sound/New Talent), Ms. Davis applies her keyboard playing and compositions to a group consisting of Tony Malaby on tenor saxophone, Eivind Opsvik on bass and Jeff Davis on drums. At 8:30, Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $8, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>THE DIPLOMATS (Wednesday) Diplomacy takes on an exuberant character in this experimental trio: the alto saxophonist Rob Brown, the trombonist Steve Swell and the drummer Harris Eisenstadt. At 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>DAVE DOUGLAS QUINTET (Through Sunday) The trumpeter Dave Douglas always seems on the verge of forming a new band, but this one -- with Uri Caine on piano and Fender Rhodes; James Genus on bass; and Clarence Penn on drums -- has been a solid entity for several years. Here they celebrate a new album, ''Meaning and Mystery'' (Greenleaf), and a valuable new member, the tenor saxophonist Donny McCaslin. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20; tonight and tomorrow, $25; with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>SCOTT FEINER'S PANDEIRO JAZZ (Tomorrow) Mr. Feiner treats the pandeiro, a tambourinelike Brazilian hand drum, as an expressive jazz instrument; he sets out to prove his point in this ensemble, with the saxophonist Joel Frahm, the guitarist Freddie Bryant and the bassist Doug Weiss. At 11 p.m. and 12:30 a.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662; cover, $15. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>FLY (Tuesday through May 14) The tenor saxophonist Mark Turner, the bassist Larry Grenadier and the drummer Jeff Ballard make up this collaborative trio, which eschews the usual horn-plus-rhythm hierarchy in the service of an elastic group ideal. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20; Friday and Saturday, $25; with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>VINCENT GARDNER-NICHOLAS PAYTON QUINTET (Tuesday through May 14) The John Coltrane album ''Blue Trane'' serves as conceptual fodder for this hard-bop ensemble, which features Mr. Payton on trumpet, Mr. Gardner on trombone and Walter Blanding Jr. on tenor saxophone. Leading the rhythm section is the capable pianist Marc Cary. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set Fridays and Saturdays, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>KENNY GARRETT QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Garrett is a bulldozer on the alto saxophone, which he applies to blazing post-Coltrane calisthenics; he's also an introspective artisan on the soprano, with which he investigates East Asian folk timbres. At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $30 and $40 , with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>DAVID GILMORE GROUP (Tomorrow) Mr. Gilmore favors the clean guitar tone of George Benson, but his playing tends more toward an African rhythmic concept and a slippery melodic sense. He works with players equal to the task: Ravi Coltrane on tenor and soprano saxophones, Luis Perdomo on piano, Brad Jones on bass and Terreon Gully on drums. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063; cover, $15; members, $10. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>STEFON HARRIS AND KENNY BARRON (Wednesday) Mr. Barron is the leading practitioner of an elegant, economical piano style that thrives in any mainstream setting; Mr. Harris is a firecracker of a vibraphonist with a brightly dynamic style. They should make for fascinating duet partners. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330.; $25. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>FRED HERSCH AND NANCY KING (Tuesday through Thursday) Mr. Hersch, the pianist, has worked memorably with the elite jazz vocalists of our era; Ms. King isn't reflexively included in those ranks, but that's certainly through no fault of her own. This duo engagement, coming on the heels of a new MaxJazz album, should bring out the best in both of them. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>JESSICA LURIE ENSEMBLE (Tuesday) Playing saxophone, flute and accordion as well as singing, Ms. Lurie wears many hats in this exploratory but often melodic group. She benefits from the accompaniment of Brandon Seabrook on banjo, mandolin and guitar; Todd Sickafoose on bass; Erik Deutsch on keyboard; and Allison Miller on drums. At 10 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $10. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>KATE McGARRY (Monday) Ms. McGarry is a quiet but potent singer who recasts jazz and folk material alike with a quavering sincerity. She works here not only with a fine trio led by the pianist Bruce Barth, but also with a tap dancer, Joseph Wiggan. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $15.(Chinen)</p>
        <p>NEW ORLEANS: CONGO SQUARE (Tonight and tomorrow night) Jazz at Lincoln Center concludes its city-hopping season with a focus on New Orleans, a place that had deep resonance for the organization long before Hurricane Katrina. In the Rose Theater, Wynton Marsalis and the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra present new music inspired by Congo Square, with help from the African percussionists Yacub Addy and Odadaa. In the Allen Room, the trombonist Wycliffe Gordon plays spirituals and gospel tunes. At 7:30 in the Allen Room, 8 in the Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500; $105.50 and $135.50. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>WILLIAM PARKER'S INTRASCOPIC MUSIC ENSEMBLE (Sunday) Mr. Parker is a pillar, musically and morally, of modern avant-garde jazz culture; he plays bass and a small arsenal of flutes and percussion in his Intrascopic Music Ensemble, which also includes several drummers, a tuba player and a visual artist. At 1:30 p.m., Clemente Soto Vélez Cultural Center, 107 Suffolk Street, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 696-6681, www.visionfestival.org; cover, $10; $7 for students; free for children 14 and under. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>CHARLI PERSIP TRIO (Tonight) A drummer with credentials stretching back to the Dizzy Gillespie Orchestra of the early 1950's, Mr. Persip leads a trio here, with James Gordon Williams on piano and Saadi Zain on bass. At 8, 10 and 11:30, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662; cover, $25. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>PAUL SHAPIRO'S MIDNIGHT MINYAN (Tuesday) As on his new album ''It's in the Twilight'' (Tzadik), Mr. Shapiro, a tenor saxophonist, transforms the ritual of a Friday night Shabbat service into a rollicking downtown jam. His co-conspirators are Steven Bernstein on slide trumpet, Peter Apfelbaum on tenor saxophone, Brian Mitchell on piano, Booker King on bass and Tony Lewis on drums. At 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $10. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>MCCOY TYNER TRIO WITH SAVION GLOVER (Tuesday through May 14) The rumbling sweep of Mr. Tyner's piano playing provokes a strong response from Mr. Glover, the paragon of rhythmic tap dance. It also interacts powerfully with the accompaniment of Charnett Moffett on bass and Eric Kamau Gravatt on drums. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $45 at tables, with a $5 minimum, or $30 at the bar, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>MARY LOU WILLIAMS COLLECTIVE (Through Sunday) The "Zodiac Suite," an astrological opus composed by the pianist Mary Lou Williams in the mid-1940's, receives a strikingly modern interpretation courtesy of this repertory project featuring Geri Allen, pianist, Kenny Davis, bassist, and Andrew Cyrille, drummer.

        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>* 'LOHENGRIN' (Tomorrow) The revival of Robert Wilson's 1998 production is not the same show that earned the director lusty boos at its premiere. The abstract sets, with luminous bars of white light against a mystical blue backdrop, are as haunting as ever. But this time the singers seem far more comfortable with the glacial movements and stylized hand and arm gestures, which have been simplified. The German tenor Klaus Florian Vogt, in his Met debut appearances, sings the title role, taking over for Ben Heppner. The charismatic soprano Karita Mattila, as Elsa, is in glorious voice. The conductor Philippe Auguin draws pulsing and incisive playing from the Met orchestra. 7:15 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $150 and $220 tickets remaining.(Anthony Tommasini)</p>
        <p>'RIGOLETTO' (Tuesday) Though Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazón, the opera world's hottest soprano-tenor couple, have moved on to other things, Verdi's ''Rigoletto'' is still with us at the Met, but with an entirely new cast from the one that sang it earlier this season. Paolo Gavanelli sings the title role, with Norah Amsellem as Gilda and Roberto Aronica as the Duke, Italian opera's most caddish character. Asher Fisch conducts. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $175.(Tommasini)</p>
        <p>* 'TOSCA' (Tonight, Monday and Thursday) Deborah Voigt will not be everyone's idea of a Tosca. Her bright and penetrating singing recalls the Nordic sound and temperament of Birgit Nilsson's in the role. But Ms. Voigt invests the character with personal touches, bringing out Tosca's vulnerability, and sings with daring abandon during the intense confrontation with the villainous Scarpia, here the veteran bass James Morris, who sounds terrific. The tenor Franco Farina is an ardent if sometimes bellowing Cavaradossi. (On Thursday, Eduardo Villa takes over for Mr. Farina and Greer Grimsley replaces Mr. Morris.) Carlo Rizzi conducts. Tonight at 8, Monday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $205 tonight, with limited availability; sold out Monday; $100 and $175 tickets remaining on Thursday.

(Jeremy Eichler)</p>
        <p>* IAN BOSTRIDGE AND LEIF OVE ANDSNES (Tomorrow) In a series of EMI recordings together, the British tenor Ian Bostridge and the Norwegian pianist Leif Ove Andsnes have proved to be a remarkably eloquent team, and of course, they have done wonders on their own as well. In this joint recital, they share the spotlight, with Mr. Andsnes opening the program with Beethoven's Sonata No. 31 and then joining Mr. Bostridge for a selection of Schubert songs. Mr. Andsnes is also giving a recital -- the same Beethoven sonata, as well as works by Schumann, Mendelssohn and Mussorgsky -- as part of the Peoples' Symphony Concerts series on Sunday afternoon. Mr. Bostridge and Mr. Andsnes perform tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; sold out. Mr. Andsnes's recital is on Sunday at 2 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, (212) 586-4680; $9 to $18. (Allan Kozinn)</p>
        <p>CAMERATA SALZBURG (Sunday) Sir Roger Norrington and his Camerata Salzburg offered a provocative Beethoven symphony cycle at Alice Tully Hall in 2003. They return with a program that includes the Bartok Divertimento and two works by Haydn: the Piano Concerto in D, with Alexei Lubimov, and the Symphony No. 92. 2 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $56. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>IMOGEN COOPER (Monday) This British pianist puts together a program with Thomas Adès's ''Traced Overhead'' surrounded by Haydn, Schumann and Schubert. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $35 to $40.(Bernard Holland)</p>
        <p>* EMERSON STRING QUARTET (Thursday) Among the great composers of the 20th century, Shostakovich was the most inscrutable. But in his 15 string quartets he came closest to showing his hand. These works are like entries in a diary and he never imagined that they would become as popular as they are today. The Emerson Quartet plays these seminal works compellingly and has recorded them complete. They are performing them all, in chronological order. The fourth of five programs offers Nos. 10, 11 and 12. 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $60. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>IRCAM@COLUMBIA (Today through Sunday) IRCAM, the Parisian citadel of electro-acoustic music, has teamed up with Columbia University for a series that winds up this weekend with a free conference (today) and two concerts.

(Kozinn)</p>
        <p>* NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight, Tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday) Sir Colin Davis returns to the New York Philharmonic with some of the composers that have long been his calling cards. Tonight and tomorrow the program is split between Mozart (the overture to ''La Clemenza di Tito,'' the Piano Concerto No. 26 and the aria ''Ch'io mi scordi di te?'') and Sibelius (''Luonnotar'' and the Third Symphony).

On Wednesday, David Zinman takes over the podium to lead Bartok's Rhapsody No. 1, John Adams's ''Naïve and Sentimental Music'' and the Beethoven Triple Concerto. The soloists are Yo-Yo Ma, cellist; Jonathan Gandelsman, violinist; and Joel Fan, pianist.

(Dunning)</p>
        <p>THIS THAT DANCE COLLECTIVE (Thursday) Lauren Hale, Jessica Gaynor and Aimee Rials, who began to work with one another in college, will present dances they describe as explorations of the relationships between dance and music, lovers and friends, word and gesture and public and private spaces.

        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>* American Folk Art Museum: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY),' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. Few exhibitions this size (35 pieces) present quite such a vivid and rewarding picture of artistic assimilation and transformation. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith)</p>
        <p>* BARD GRADUATE CENTER: 'AMERICAN STREAMLINED DESIGN: THE WORLD OF TOMORROW,' through June 11. Streamlining, a particularly American design concept born of our love of speed and admiration for industrial production, peaked in the 1930's and 40's, and is now said to be undergoing a revival. This tribute to it includes more than 180 objects, from boring but useful items like a receipt printer designed by Walter Dorwin Teague in 1946 to a plastic bicycle helmet of flowing teardrop shapes designed by John Larkin in 2000. The show is perhaps too packed with repetitive examples -- do we need to see three similar electric drills? -- but don't let that stop you. There's no shortage of wonderful things to look at here. 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000. (Grace Glueck)</p>
        <p>* BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000.(Glueck)</p>
        <p>* Brooklyn Museum: WILLIAM WEGMAN: 'FUNNEY/STRANGE,' through May 28. Descended from Marcel Duchamp and Buster Keaton, Mr. Wegman has straddled high and low for more than three decades, using his signature Weimaraners to make the art world's funniest videos, as well as television commercials, calendars and children's books. (See above.) (Smith)</p>
        <p>DAHESH MUSEUM OF ART: 'Stories to Tell: Masterworks from the Kelly Collection of American Illustration,' through May 21. During the Golden Age of Illustration -- the 1880's to the 1930's -- images made by painters for magazines and books captivated the collective American psyche. Original works by some of the best of those artists, including J. C. Leyendecker, N. C. Wyeth and Charles Dana Gibson, are included in this extensive and well-selected exhibition. 580 Madison Avenue, near 57th Street, (212) 759-0606. (Ken Johnson)</p>
        <p>* FRICK COLLECTION: 'GOYA's LAST WORKS,' through May 14. This compact show is sublime. The most humane portraits are mixed with sketches, like diary entries, in which society is an irredeemable mob of lunatics and murderers. In exile in Bordeaux, Goya spent his last days in physical misery, lamenting man's essential evil while experimenting with the new medium of lithography and inventing the most exquisite, luminous paintings on tiny chips of ivory. Like the late works of Titian or Rembrandt, Goya's late works achieve a whole new level of freedom and depth, haunted by death but exalted. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Michael Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>* FRICK COLLECTION: 'VERONESE'S ALLEGORIES: VIRTUE, LOVE AND EXPLORATION IN RENAISSANCE VENICE,' through July 16. Paolo Veronese (1528-88), a superb colorist and one of the most suavely sensuous of Renaissance Venetian painters, used the age-old device of allegory to make abstract concepts visual, often by means of human or mythological figures. In this five-painting show, the first to include all of his large-scale allegories from American collections, high ideals mingle with earthy and sometimes erotic physicality, as in the painting ''Venus and Mars United by Love.'' (See above.) (Glueck)</p>
        <p>* Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum: 'David Smith: A Centennial,' through May 14. David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces that the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. (212) 423-3500.(Holland Cotter)</p>
        <p>* International Center of Photography: 'Snap Judgments: New Positions in Contemporary African Photography,' through May 28. If Martians tuned into our television news broadcasts, they'd have a miserable impression of life on Earth. War, disease, poverty, heartbreak and nothing else. That's exactly how most of the world sees Africa: filtered through images of calamity. The Nigerian-born curator Okwui Enwezor offers a bracing alternative view in this show of recent photography from Africa. He isn't interested in simply exchanging an upbeat Africa for a downbeat one, smiles for frowns, but in engineering a slow, complex, panoptical turn in perspective, one that takes in many moods and directions. The results are stimulating, astringent, brimming with life. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'HATSHEPSUT,' through July 9. Can a queen be a king, too? Consider the case of Hatshepsut, an Egyptian ruler of the 15th century B.C. She assumed the supreme title of pharaoh and ruled Egypt in that powerfully masculine role until her death. Hatshepsut is the subject of a celebratory show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one that commemorates the 100th anniversary of the Met's department of Egyptian art. Organized by the Met and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, it includes many objects from the Met's own extensive holdings, excavated at its digs in the 1920's and 30's. But it isn't so easy to follow Hatshepsut's trail in this ambitious show, what with the number of relatives, subordinates, minor officials and such who also have a place in it, along with scarabs, jewelry, pottery, furniture and other artifacts. (212) 535-7710. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>* Morgan Library and Museum: 'Masterworks from the Morgan,'  through Sept. 10. Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's splendid four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels, medieval objects made with so much silver and gold that they seem to give off heat. What's not new: almost everything in this celebratory exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts, as well as illuminated gospels, devotional sculptures and historical and literary autograph manuscripts from the Brontes to Bob Dylan. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or themorgan.org. ( Individual show closings can be checked by telephone or through the Web site.) (Cotter)</p>
        <p>* The Museum of Modern Art: 'Without Boundary: Seventeen Ways of Looking,' through May 22. This excellent group show considers what ''Islamic'' means in the work of several contemporary artists, and it means many things, none simple. Just to see the uses made of calligraphy by Shirazeh Houshiary, Rachid Koraichi and Shirin Neshat is to understand the lesson in variety put forward here. At the same time, the show is far from didactic. It's beautiful, sexy and, in the case of Raqib Shaw's painting and Kutlug Ataman's video of Sufi meditation, ecstatic. (212) 708-9400. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>NEUE GALERIE: 'KLEE AND AMERICA,' through May 22. For a long time, the Swiss-born artist Paul Klee (1879-1940), regarded as a leading Modernist figure in Europe, didn't believe his delicate, chimerical work had much of a future in the United States. Yet, thanks to artists, collectors and dealers with close contacts in Germany who had begun to discover his work, by the early 1920's, Klee's impact began to be felt here. This show of more than 60 paintings and drawings assembled exclusively from American holdings covers the wide spectrum of Klee's work. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>* The Studio Museum In harlem: 'Energy/Experimentation: Black Artists and Abstraction, 1964-1980,' through July 2. During one of the most radical periods in 20th-century American politics, the Black Power era, a group of African-American artists was working in one of the most radical forms of 20th-century art: abstraction. This show is stylishly installed; the 15 artists are intensely individualistic and part of an important history. One, the sculptor Tom Lloyd (1921-96), opened the Studio Museum with a solo show in 1968. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Whitney Museum of American Art: 'WHITNEY BIENNIAL 2006: DAY FOR NIGHT,' through May 28. This biennial will provoke much head-scratching by uninitiated visitors. A hermetic take on what has been making waves, it's packaged -- branded might be the better word -- as a show long on collaboration and open-endedness: several shows under one roof, including a revival of the 1960's ''Peace Tower,'' which rises like a Tinker Toy construction from the Whitney courtyard, with contributions by dozens of artists. As a counter to the image of the art world as rich, youth-besotted and obsessed with crafty little nothings, the ethos here is provisional, messy, half-baked, cantankerous, insular -- radical qualities art used to have when it could still call itself radical and wasn't like a barnacle clinging to the cruise ship of pop culture. That was back in the 1970's. And much of what's here (including works by bohemians and other senior eccentrics around then) harks back to that moment. (800) 944-8639 or www.whitney.org. (Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>Galleries: 57th Street</p>
        <p>* 'Great Pots: The Vessel as Art, 1900 to 2000' This extraordinarily rich and varied lobby show presents 164 works by 143 artists from the Newark Museum's famed ceramics collection. It focuses on utilitarian vessels -- vases, bowls, pots, mugs and platters -- but covers an enormous amount of aesthetic territory, taking in Pueblo Indian, Arts and Crafts, classical Japanese, European Modernist, Pop, funk and much more. The show includes great craftsmen like George Orr, Beatrice Wood, Peter Voulkos and Ron Nagel. The UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, near 51st Street, (212) 713-2885, through May 19. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Galleries: SoHo</p>
        <p>'The Garden Party' This crowded group show on the theme of the erotic garden looks as if it were produced by a college fraternity for its spring festival. It includes high-profile artists like Vanessa Beecroft, Olafur Eliasson and Yoko Ono. Deitch Projects, 76 Grand Street, near Greene Street, (212) 343-7300, through May 13. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Hanna Liden: 'Hairfaces, Scapegoats, Birds, Bloodsuckers, Squareheads &amp; a Few Deaths' A Swedish artist who is in this year's Whitney Biennial, Ms. Liden produces staged color photographs that resemble stills from a low-budget gothic horror movie. With young people in tribal masks menaced by black shrouded figures of death in beautiful wilderness settings, they suggest a meeting of Ingmar Berman and ''The Road Warrior.'' Rivington Arms, 4 East Second Street, East Village, (646) 654-3213, through May 14. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>Ed Clark: 'Rebirth' Mr. Clark, who turns 80 on May 6, uses push brooms to sweep great quantities of paint across medium-large canvases, creating bold, suave and sensuous Abstract Expressionist evocations of oceanic flux. G. R. N'Namdi, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 929-6645, through May 11. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>* Lisa Ruyter: 'I Am a Camera'  This painter, known for colorful, photo-based, psychedelic cartoons, takes an exciting turn to black, white and many shades of gray in a series of large, psychologically resonant, finely outlined self-portraits. The nearly 16-foot-wide portrait of the artist, doubled in a mirror against an arboreal background, is a knockout. Team, 527 West 26th Street, (212) 279-9219, through May 13. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Robert Sholties: 'Evolution' A Pennsylvania postal worker with no formal art training, Mr. Sholties paints intensely detailed fantasy landscapes populated by wild and domestic animals and people who are often in South American costumes. Magical, allegorical and apocalyptic events occur, and themes of religion and ecological disaster are addressed in these visionary pictures. Ricco Maresca, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-4819, through May 13.(Johnson)</p>
        <p>Davor Vrankic With impressively skillful application of graphite on paper, this Paris-based Croatian artist creates darkly comical images of big-eyed, E.T.-like monsters who appear to be undergoing some terrible psychological suffering. The Proposition, 559 West 22nd Street, (212) 242-0035, through May 13. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Other Galleries</p>
        <p>'An American Abroad: Sandra Fisher and her School of London Friends' Fisher, who was married to the painter R. B. Kitaj, was an American who lived in London until her death in 1994 at age 47. This show of more than 60 drawings and paintings, mostly portraits or nudes, reveals a modestly talented traditionalist with a deft, painterly touch and a down-to-earth affection for her subjects. Also included are some portraits of Fisher by artists like Frank Auerbach, Avigdor Arikha and Mr. Kitaj. New York Studio School, 8 West Eighth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 673-6466, through May 13. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Ken Butler: 'Instrumental Desire: Strings Attached' Trained as a classical musician and as a painter, Mr. Butler is a performance artist who produces electronically amplified music on unlikely stringed instruments that he constructs himself out of found objects and parts of real instruments. This jam-packed exhibition presents 79 instruments made from things like a rifle, an old sled, a leaf rake and a metal detector. Sideshow, 319 Bedford Avenue, at South Second Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 486-8180, through May 14. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>* ECHOES FROM THE STEPPES: MONGOLIAN 17TH-, 18TH- AND 19TH-CENTURY BRONZES AND PAINTINGS The bronzes represent the four styles of Mongolian religious sculpture, but the main event is the 77 sakhuis paintings -- small, finely wrought, richly colored portraits of Buddhist priests and protective or wrathful deities that the nomadic Mongols wore, framed in silver, as amulets. E. &amp; J. Frankel, 1040 Madison Avenue, at 79th Street, (212) 879-5733; closes tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'EDVARD MUNCH: THE MODERN LIFE OF THE SOUL'  This affecting, full-scale retrospective is the first survey of this Norwegian painter in an American museum in almost 30 years. Its more than 130 oils and works on paper cover Munch's entire career, from 1880 to 1944. (212) 708-9400; closes on Monday. (Because of the popularity of the show, museum hours will be extended tomorrow to 8 p.m.) (Glueck)</p>
        <p>James Harrison: 'The Future is in the Past' Densely worked, visionary paintings and drawings like the ones in this fascinating show have made Harrison (1925-90) a figure of cultlike devotion for certain local artists. Luise Ross, 511 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 343-2161; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Gedi Sibony and Josh Smith These cool, dry hipsters provoke a mildly irate perplexity. Mr. Smith roughly paints his own name in large, blocky letters on collages and stretched store-bought fabric. Mr. Sibony has placed sheets of cardboard, plywood, sheetrock and perforated metal around the gallery; removed part of a gallery wall; and covered part of one room with nondescript carpet. Harris Lieberman, 89 Vandam Street, at Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 206-1290; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Amy Sillman With sensuous verve Ms. Sillman mixes a number of different painterly languages in her appealing but uncertainly focused paintings: Abstract Expressionism, Cubism, Constructivism and primitivistic image-making. Sikkema Jenkins, 530 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-2262; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)</p>

Rattlestick Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444.</p>
        <p>'THE CAINE MUTINY COURT-MARTIAL' In previews. Opens Sunday.

With Tim Daly and Zeljko Ivanek. Jerry Zaks directs (2:15). The Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.</p>

New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200.</p>
        <p>'DEFYING HITLER' In previews. Opens Sunday. Developed at the Royal National Theater in London, where it was performed as a companion piece to Michael Frayn's ''Democracy,'' this adaptation of the memoirs of Sebastian Haffner is about a German growing up between the two world wars. Part of the Brits Off Broadway festival (1:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200.</p>
        <p>'NO CHILD' In previews. Opens Wednesday. Nilaja Sun plays teachers, students and janitors in the Epic Theater Center's one-woman examination of the public school system. Hal Brooks directs (1:10). Beckett Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200.</p>

        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>* 'AWAKE AND SING!' Dreams and disappointments, hopes and fears, encouraging words and bitter put-downs clash by day and night in Clifford Odets's turbulent comedy-drama about a Jewish family struggling to stay afloat in the 1930's. A gifted roster of performers -- including Mark Ruffalo, Lauren Ambrose, Zoë Wanamaker and Ben Gazzara -- manage to locate the dreaming centers of their characters, buried beneath layers of political sloganeering, everyday gripes or street slang. And even when the focus occasionally blurs in Bartlett Sher's ultimately moving revival, Odets's zesty dialogue is a joy to hear (2:30). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'BAREFOOT IN THE PARK' For a work that celebrates the liberating force of spontaneity, this revival of Neil Simon's 1963 comedy doesn't have one scene that feels organic, let alone impromptu. Directed by Scott Elliott, and starring Patrick Wilson and a miscast Amanda Peet as newlyweds in Greenwich Village, this ''Barefoot'' has the robotic gait of Frankenstein's monster (2:20). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'BRIDGE &amp; TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the stand-outs in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'FESTEN' An intensely staged, indifferently acted production of David Eldridge's adaptation of a 1998 Danish film about a grim family reunion, which was a big hit in London under the same director, Rufus Norris. While the mise en scène remains unsettlingly stark, the Broadway cast (which includes Michael Hayden, Julianna Margulies, Jeremy Sisto and Ali MacGraw) registers the tension and testiness of people suffering from a collective bad hair day. Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'HOT FEET' A dancing encyclopedia of clichés set to the music of Earth, Wind and Fire. Numbing (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'LESTAT' A musical sleeping pill, adapted from Anne Rice's ''Vampire Chronicles'' and featuring songs by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, that could well give the makers of Ambien a run for their money. Dare to look upon this tale of the undead and keep your eyelids from growing heavier and heavier and heavier (2:30). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, near 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE PAJAMA GAME'  Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THREE DAYS OF RAIN'  (2:30). In this revival of Richard Greenberg's slender, elegant drama of family disconnectedness, Julia Roberts is stiff with self-consciousness, glancingly acquainted with the two characters she plays and deeply, disturbingly beautiful. Otherwise, it is almost impossible to discern the virtues of the play itself in this wooden and splintered production, directed by Joe Mantello and also starring Paul Rudd and Bradley Cooper, who have little chance of capturing the audience's attention (2:30). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE THREEPENNY OPERA' Presented as a long, pansexual orgy, Scott Elliot's numbing revival of the Brecht-Weill classic feels like a party where the hangover begins almost as soon as the evening does. The starry cast includes Alan Cumming (as Mac the Knife) and a Dietrich-like Cyndi Lauper, though only Jim Dale and Nellie McKay appear to have a clue as to what the show is about (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE WEDDING SINGER'  An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotes from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'WELL' Lisa Kron's sparkling autobiographical play about illness, integration and her mother (portrayed with majestic warmth and weariness by Jayne Houdyshell) helps restore the honor of that tarnished literary form, the memoir. Though it shows the strain of scaling up for Broadway, this singular work, which stars Ms. Kron as herself, opens windows of insight and emotion found in no other show (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'ASSISTED LOVING' This warm and witty monologue by Bob Morris, who contributes the Age of Dissonance column to the Sunday Styles section of The New York Times, is performed by the author, who chronicles his widowed father's and his own search for love in and around New York. Engaging, subtle and winning (1:10). Daryl Roth Theater, D-Lounge, 103 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200. (George Hunka)</p>
        <p>'BASED ON A TOTALLY TRUE STORY' A chatty, autobiographical comedy by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa about a writer for comic books who moonlights as a screenwriter and playwright. Juggling his two jobs, the busy writer begins backsliding in his unofficial third, ''being a loving, giving, emotionally available boyfriend.'' Minor-key angst ensues in this perky two hours of comic navel-gazing (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE CONTRAST' Royall Tyler's slender 1787 romantic comedy -- one of the first professional American plays ever produced -- should be of more interest to historians than to theatergoers (2:30). Theater at St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Jason Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'DEFIANCE' The second in John Patrick Shanley's cycle of morality plays that began with ''Doubt,'' this ambitious tale of racial relations and the military mindset on a North Carolina marine base feels both overcrowded and oddly diffuse. If ''Doubt'' has an elegant and energy-efficient sprinter's gait, ''Defiance'' progresses with a flustered air of distraction. The excellent Margaret Colin, as an officer's wife, provides a welcome shot of credibility (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, Theater 1, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'ENTERTAINING MR. SLOANE' Scott Ellis's underpowered production of Joe Orton's great farce of sexual hypocrisy, which stars Alec Baldwin in a comedy sketch of a performance, is breezy, often funny and rarely convincing. (2:00). Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'GEORGE M. COHAN TONIGHT!'  The all-singing, all-dancing Jon Peterson summons the spirit of this legendary Broadway entertainer in this engaging one-man musical, devised and directed by Chip Deffaa (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Hunka)</p>
        <p>'GUARDIANS'  Peter Morris's play juxtaposes the moral decline of two disparate characters caught up in the destructive tailwinds of the American invasion of Iraq: a cold-blooded tabloid journalist in London and a soldier in the United States Army. Lee Pace and Katherine Moennig give persuasive performances as the sleazy hack and the scapegoated grunt, but Mr. Morris's play is more flashily provocative than truly thoughtful (1:30). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'I LOVE YOU BECAUSE'  The plotline -- single New Yorkers in search of love -- couldn't be more familiar, but somehow this fluffy, funny musical makes it refreshing, helped along by an engaging six-member cast, with David A. Austin making a particularly hilarious impression. An impressive start for Ryan Cunningham (book and lyrics) and Joshua Salzman (music), both still in their 20's (2:00). Village Theater, 158 Bleecker Street, near Sullivan Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100. (Neil Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>'THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST'  Lynn Redgrave is an unusually vigorous Lady Bracknell in Sir Peter Hall's new production of Oscar Wilde's peerless comedy from 1895. A satisfactory production that works effectively as a romantic farce but more erratically as a vehicle for Wilde's paradox-perfumed wit. (2:25) Brooklyn Academy of Music, Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best. (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'LANDSCAPE OF THE BODY'  This terrific revival, directed by Michael Greif, identifies the unbearable wistfulness of being in John Guare's delirious heartbreaker of a comedy from 1977. The top-flight cast is led by Lili Taylor and Sherie Rene Scott as sisters -- one living, one a singing ghost -- who move in and out of a lyrical and sordid world where tabloid prurience has become a religion. Signature Theater's Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'RED LIGHT WINTER'  A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, this play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'SANDRA BERNHARD: EVERYTHING BAD AND BEAUTIFUL' Sandra Bernhard was a proverbial rock star long before headline-making folks in even the most prosaic walks of life were being referred to as such. Her new show, a collection of songs interspersed with musings on her life and on public figures ranging from Britney Spears to Condoleezza Rice, is casual to the point of being offhand. That said, it's invigorating to be in the presence of a true original (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, at Union Square, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'SORE THROATS' Howard Brenton's scabrous 1979 drama about the bilious aftermath of a British marriage. Laila Robins and Bill Camp are a middle-aged, newly divorced couple warring over the past and the future. The play's insights into the irreducible conflict between human needs and the constraints of civilization are a little murky (2:10). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'STUFF HAPPENS'  Daniel Sullivan's sharp, invigorating production of David Hare's journalistic drama about the road to war in Iraq is conducted on the modest scale of a town-hall meeting. The characters (who have names like Bush and Blair) seem less like destiny-shaping gods than the ego trippers in your office. If that means they're too close for comfort, then ''Stuff Happens'' is doing its job (2:50). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'TRYST' A suspense drama of a distinctly old-fashioned stamp about the romance between a handsome cad (Maxwell Caulfield) and a lonely spinster (Amelia Campbell). Will the wily predator seduce and abandon the mousy milliner? Karoline Leach's play springs a few twists that lack psychological credibility but keep the plot on the boil (2:00). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>Off Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'ADVENTURES OF CAVEMAN ROBOT: THE MUSICAL' A disjointed but vivid homage and musical parody, by Jeff Lewonczyk and Debby Schwartz, of comic books and superheroes. Sloppy and long, too (2:10). Brick Theater, 575 Metropolitan Avenue, at Lorimer Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 907-3457. (Hunka)</p>
        <p>Long-Running Shows</p>
        <p>'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) John Patrick Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions in the clash between the head of a parochial school and the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100.( Lawrence Van Gelder)</p>
        <p>'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>'MACRUNE'S GUEVARA' The Young Mirror arm of Mirror Repertory revives John Spurling's odd 1969 play about an artist who left behind a wall full of drawings of Che Guevara, and the man who saw something profound in them. Parts of the play read today like a funny sendup of art critics who see too much brilliance in outsider-art gibberish; other parts seem a bit like gibberish of their own (2:15). St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444; closing Wednesday. (Genzlinger)</p>

        <p>'AKEELAH AND THE BEE' (PG, 112 minutes) Eleven-year-old Akeelah Anderson (Keke Palmer) is a bright but unmotivated girl who can outspell anyone at her South Los Angeles middle school. When Akeelah gets a taste of victory by winning the school bee, she throws herself into studying for the regional one, coached by a stern English professor named Joshua Larabee (Laurence Fishburne). But Akeelah's mother (Angela Bassett) objects to her daughter's obsession with what she considers a ''game.'' The innate suspense and charm of the spelling bee, along with a trio of crack performances, turn what is, in essence, a formulaic picture into something more satisfying: an underdog tale that manages to inspire without being sappy. (Dana Stevens)</p>
        <p>* 'CLEAN' (R, 110 minutes) This fine French movie, written and directed by Olivier Assayas, is one of the few fictional films to evoke realistically the grubby texture of existence for second- and third-tier rock celebrities crumbling under a combination of fading renown and drug addiction. Maggie Cheung and Nick Nolte offer memorable portrayals as a recovering junkie and her compassionate father-in-law. (Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'THE DEATH OF MR. LAZARESCU' (R, 154 minutes, in Romanian) This Romanian film follows the grueling final hours of an ailing, alcoholic 62-year-old man in Bucharest, as he is shuttled among four city hospitals. A sustained triumph of ensemble acting, the film seems so absolutely real that it absorbs you into its world in the same way that a documentary like Frederick Wiseman's ''Hospital'' seeps into your consciousness.(Holden)</p>
        <p>'GUYS AND BALLS' (R, 106 minutes, in German) In the German soccer comedy ''Guys and Balls,'' a baker's son (Maximilian Brückner) who is gay forms an all-gay team to defeat his hometown homophobes. Groaning with double-entendres and flaming gay stereotypes, the movie's climactic game offers some of the most sustained -- and literal -- gay bashing in movie history, even if the outcome is no more surprising than that of any other underdog comedy. Adam Sandler is probably already in training.(Jeannette Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'HOW I KILLED A SAINT' (No rating, 82 minutes, in Macedonian and English) Set in Macedonia during the 2001 civil conflict with the country's ethnic Albanians, ''How I Killed a Saint'' views the crisis through the eyes of two deeply troubled siblings. Filmed in a covert, voyeuristic style that's virtually devoid of close-ups, the movie successfully conveys the pervasive anxiety of a country teetering on the brink of civil war. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'ICE AGE: THE MELTDOWN' (PG, 93 minutes) Creative exhaustion haunts ''Ice Age: The Meltdown,'' as the characters from 2002's ''Ice Age'' face global warming and the submersion of their valley. While the animals head for safety in a giant, arklike boat, the director, Carlos Saldanha, indulges in biblical imagery and bad science. Over all, a flat and uninspired follow-up to a vastly superior movie. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'INSIDE MAN' (R, 128 minutes) The latest from Spike Lee takes a familiar setup -- a Wall Street bank heist that mutates into a hostage crisis -- and twists it ever so slightly and nicely. Among the film's most sustained pleasures are its holy trinity -- Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster -- and the best lineup of pusses and mugs outside ''The Sopranos.'' (Manohla Dargis)</p>
        <p>'LADY VENGEANCE' (R, 111 minutes, in Korean) Park Chanwook completes his ''vengeance trilogy'' with this kinder, gentler exercise in pulp pyrotechnics and empty virtuosity. (Nathan Lee)</p>
        <p>* 'L'ENFANT (THE CHILD)' (R, 100 minutes, in French) The latest from the Belgian brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne involves a young thief (Jérémie Renier) who one day sells his newborn son for a fat envelope of cash. What interests the Dardennes -- what invests their work with such terrific urgency -- is not only how a man would sell a child as casually as a slab of beef, but also whether a man like this, having committed such a repellent offense, can find redemption. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'THE LOST CITY' (R, 143 minutes) Andy Garcia's ode to the Havana of pre-Communist Cuba is a romantic epic manqué that swoons across the screen for nearly 2 1/2 hours without saying much beyond the fact that life sure was peachy before Fidel Castro came to town and ruined everything. (Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE' (R, 91 minutes) With the help of her charmingly enthusiastic star, Gretchen Mol, the director Mary Harron unwraps the great 1950's pinup queen Bettie Page, who for years was a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside a web of expertly tied rope. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'SCARY MOVIE 4' (PG-13, 83 minutes) This parasitic franchise is back to feed on last year's disposable distractions, proving, if nothing else, that there's a laugh or two left in ''Brokeback Mountain'' parodies and Viagra overdoses. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'RV' (PG, 102 minutes) Nowadays, no family movie is complete without a values-oriented agenda and a bountiful supply of fecal matter, and ''RV'' supplies both. Robin Williams is an overworked executive trying to reconnect with his family on a mobile-home vacation. Barry Sonnenfeld directs with one eye on the production and the other on the clock, producing a movie that feels as clapped-out as the titular vehicle itself. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'THE SENTINEL' (PG-13, 108 minutes) The question is why: why would a star of Michael Douglas's stature and obvious intelligence attach himself to a Washington thriller as deeply ridiculous, suspense-free and potentially career-damaging as ''The Sentinel''? (Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'SIR! NO SIR!' (No rating, 84 minutes) In this smart, very timely documentary, the filmmaker David Zeiger revisits one of the memorable and least revisited chapters of the Vietnam War, the antiwar movement inside the military.(Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'STICK IT' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Somersaulting through happy clichés and unexpected invention, this spry teenage comedy gets everything right. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'SUITE HABANA' (No rating, 80 minutes, in Spanish) Fernando Pérez tracks a day in 10 ordinary lives in Havana. It may not be a representative portrait of the city, but its most compelling subjects, especially a widower and his disabled son, linger in the mind. (Neil Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>'Thank You for Smoking' (R, 92 minutes) The director Jason Reitman has made a glib and funny movie from Christopher Buckley's glib and funny novel about a Big Tobacco lobbyist, but the real attraction here is the hard-working star, Aaron Eckhart. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'WATER' (PG-13, 114 minutes, in Hindi) Set in India in 1938, ''Water'' focuses on a group of widows condemned by Hindu law to live in an institution on the banks of the River Ganges. The arrival of a high-spirited 8-year-old girl encourages one widow to question her faith and another to begin a love affair with a Gandhian idealist. Bobbing back and forth between romantic melodrama and spiritual inquiry, ''Water'' is an exquisitely beautiful film about the institutionalized oppression of an entire class of women. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'THE WHORE'S SON' (No rating, 86 minutes, in German) Michael Sturminger's unsentimental German-language debut feature fearlessly plumbs the depths of an intense mother-son relationship, in which Ozren (appearing at ages 3, 8 and 16) becomes more aware, as the years pass, that his beloved mother, Silvija, is a high-class prostitute. (Laura Kern)</p>
        <p>'THE WILD' (G, 94 minutes) Filled with softness and texture, ''The Wild'' follows Samson the lion (voiced by Kiefer Sutherland) as he escapes from the zoo to rescue his cub, who has stowed away on a ship bound for Africa. With inspired voice work from Eddie Izzard as a pukka koala and William Shatner as a menacing wildebeest, the movie also finds time to explore the travails of single fatherhood and the evils of oppression. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>Film Series</p>
        <p>ROBERT ALTMAN (Through June 8) The Museum of the Moving Image's 22-film retrospective of Mr. Altman's work continues this weekend with features including ''Thieves Like Us'' (1974), starring Keith Carradine and Shelley Duvall as Bonnie and Clyde types; ''Secret Honor'' (1983), with Philip Baker Hall as Richard M.

(Gates)</p>
        <p>A BRIEF ENCOUNTER WITH NOËL COWARD On Wednesdays in May, the Donnell Media Center is screening Coward films from the 1940's, his most prolific period. Next Wednesday's feature is ''In Which We Serve'' (1942), a war drama about a British destroyer, starring and directed by Coward (1899-1973). The series will also include ''This Happy Breed'' (1947), ''Blithe Spirit'' (1945) and, of course, ''Brief Encounter'' (1945). 20 West 53rd Street, (212) 621-0609; free. (Gates)</p>
        <p>THE FILMS OF MIKIO NARUSE (Through Wednesday) BAMcinématek's tribute to Naruse (1905-69), the Japanese realist filmmaker, continues this weekend with three films. ''Summer Clouds'' (1958) is about a rural war widow who has an affair with a newspaper reporter. ''Floating Clouds'' (1955) is Naruse's masterpiece about a typist and an engineer in postwar Tokyo. ''When a Woman Ascends the Stairs'' (1960) is the story of an aging bar hostess in the Ginza bar district. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates)</p>
        <p>REDISCOVERING ROSCOE: THE CAREER OF FATTY ARBUCKLE (Through May 15). The Museum of Modern Art's 54-film retrospective of the acting and directing career of the scandal-ridden Arbuckle (1887-1933) continues this weekend with a program of silent films directed by Arbuckle, including ''Fatty's Reckless Fling'' (1915) and a program of four 1917 films starring Arbuckle and Buster Keaton. (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates)</p>

This weekend's films include Oussama Mohammad's ''Stars in Broad Daylight'' (1988), a drama about a double wedding; Mohammad Malas's ''Dreams of the City'' (1983); and Abdellatif Abdul-Hamid's ''Nights of the Jackals'' (1989), about a peasant family with a neighborhood noise problem. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, (212) 875-5600; $10. (Gates)</p>
        <p>Pop</p>
        <p>Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.</p>
        <p>BAMBOOZLE (Tomorrow and Sunday) Somehow it is appropriate that this two-day festival, a cluster of a few dozen bands with a big presence on MySpace.com, is taking the form of a huge, flat sprawl in the Meadowlands parking lots: an endless web of fans and bands blending together. Fall Out Boy headlines tomorrow, followed by, among many others, All American Rejects, Hawthorne Heights, Thursday, Mewithoutyou, Minus the Bear, Motion City Soundtrack, Relient K, Armor for Sleep, Keating, the Killing Sequence and Streetlight Manifesto. On Sunday, Taking Back Sunday headlines, with AFI, Captured by Robots, From Autumn to Ashes, Him, Moneen, Saves the Day, Panic! at the Disco, Say Anything, Poison the Well and the festival's token hip-hop star, Method Man. At 11:30 a.m., Meadowlands Sports Complex, Routes 3 and 120, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900 or (212) 307-7171; $32 both days. (Ben Sisario)</p>
        <p>BLACK LIPS, SOLDIERS OF FORTUNE (Tonight) Fresh from their appearances opening up for the Yeah Yeah Yeahs at the cavernous Roseland, the Black Lips, from Atlanta, have a gig that is more their size. The band plays a grisly version of 1960's garage rock that sounds deliberately damaged. With Soldiers of Fortune -- which includes members of the garage-metal-experimental band Oneida, Jah Division and the countryish Oakley Hall -- and Mountains of Mattalama. At 10, Place, Norman and Kingsland Avenues, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, www.toddpnyc.com; $8. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* THE BOOKS (Tonight) Nick Zammuto and Paul de Jong of the Books make beguiling electronic collages out of seemingly incongruous elements: disembodied vocal samples, a few plucks from a banjo or another string instrument, and unclassifiable noises that fade in and out like traffic. Part of the pleasure of listening to their music is trying to figure out just why it all works so wonderfully and wittily. Their performance will incorporate video as well as audio, and their opening act is the always adventurous violinist Todd Reynolds, of the string quartet Ethel. At 9, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; sold out. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>BRIAN JONESTOWN MASSACRE (Wednesday) This tuneless headache of a band, modeled on the jangly psychedelic rock of Britain and Los Angeles in the mid-1960's as well as the self-destructive persona of Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones, was on its way into obscurity when, two years ago, it was featured in a hit documentary, ''Dig!,'' and a legend was created. Since then the band has toured widely, to large audiences who wait for its leader, Anton Newcombe, to lash out in paranoia and, as he did in the film, kick a fan in the head. With the Lilys. At 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $20. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>CLEM SNIDE (Tomorrow and Monday) With a homely, nasal tenor and a few lonesome strums on his guitar, Eef Barzelay, the lead singer and chief songwriter of the band Clem Snide, can picture heartache and regret in trompe-l'oeil precision or, if the mood strikes him, simply goof off. In one song on his new solo album, ''Bitter Honey'' (SpinArt), he takes on the persona of a woman whose rear end makes an appearance in a video: ''It was on screen for a second but was kind of hard to miss.'' With Elvis Perkins, a band from Rhode Island that borrows Clem Snide's spacious sound without Mr. Barzelay's quirks. Tomorrow at 9 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. Monday at 8 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $10. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>CONCRETES (Monday) This eight-piece group from Stockholm specializes in the kind of breezy, nostalgic chamber-pop popularized by Belle and Sebastian, with hummable and carefully orchestrated hymns to innocence and sunshine. Opening the show is the Australian singer and songwriter Sally Seltmann, performing under the stage name New Buffalo. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $15. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>EVAN DANDO (Tonight) Mr. Dando, the lead heartthrob of the Lemonheads -- who by many reports did a surprisingly credible job singing with the reunited MC5 two years ago, though most fans had none of it -- plays a solo show. With the Hymns. At 8, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; $15. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* FAUN FABLES, BARBEZ (Tomorrow) On a bed of ghostly acoustic folk, Faun Fables's Dawn McCarthy and Nils Frykdahl build an astonishing and unpredictable kind of pop theater, at once grandiose and nightmarish and silly. Their new album, ''The Transit Rider'' (Drag City), is a creepily obsessive song cycle about the commuting life, which the band will perform in costume, with films and a cast of four. Barbez, from New York, finds an enticing middle ground between Kurt Weill's cabaret, droning avant-garde rock and the twinkling perpetual-motion pieces of Erik Satie. At 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>PAUL GREEN SCHOOL OF ROCK MUSIC (Tomorrow and Sunday) As seen in the documentary ''Rock School,'' Mr. Green offers an extensive rock curriculum at his school in Philadelphia, teaching youngsters the canon as well as the fundamentals of power chords and budda-budda bass lines. For three weekends this month, his students will visit CBGB to show off their mastery of the classics. The residency begins with the music of Frank Zappa, which received a spirited reading in the film. (Next are the Beatles and AC/DC.) 4 p.m., 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052; $10. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>INXS (Tonight) Last year ''Rock Star: INXS,'' the reality series on CBS, picked a new singer for the onetime hit makers of INXS, whose original singer and only recognizable member, Michael Hutchence, died in 1997. The winner was one J. D. Fortune, a former Elvis impersonator who became -- this was reality TV, remember -- a Michael Hutchence impersonator. At 8, Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171; $49.50 to $79.50. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>YUNGCHEN LHAMO (Tonight) Long exiled from Tibet, Ms. Lhamo sings tender and mournful prayers about struggle and forgiveness, set to a soothing New Age sound that incorporates foamy electronics, electric guitars and assorted world-music instruments, like the African kora. Tonight she appears with some guests from her new album, ''Ama'' (Real World), including the British singer Joy Askew. At 8, Lerner Hall Theater at Columbia University, Broadway at 115th Street, Morningside Heights, (866) 468-7619; $25; $21 for members of Tibet House; $17 for students and Tibetans. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* LIGHTNING BOLT (Sunday) At first it is hard to believe that all the glorious chaos of Lightning Bolt -- a stalwart of the big noise-punk scene in Providence, R.I. -- is being made by only two people, the bassist Brian Gibson and the drummer and vocalist Brian Chippendale. But as the sound comes into focus, a playful give-and-take becomes clear, as Mr. Gibson and Mr. Chippendale toss back and forth gigantic metal riffs and giggly high notes, creating rainbows of dissonance. This concert, before the band goes on a European tour, is a benefit for Tarantula Hill, a performance space in Baltimore that was recently damaged by a fire. Also on the bill are the Brooklyn sludge-rockers Double Leopards, the Baltimore duo Nautical Almanac and Kites, a one-man noise factory from Providence. At 7 p.m., the Hook, 18 Commerce Street, near Richards Street, Red Hook, Brooklyn, (718) 797-3007; $10. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>MASTERS OF INDIAN MUSIC (Tonight) U. Shrinivas is not only a virtuoso on the electric mandolin but also a clever innovator: he made modifications on his instrument to adapt it for the Carnatic classical style of southern India. Born in 1969, he has long bridged classical and pop styles, first as a prodigy at jazz festivals and later with John McLaughlin and his group Remember Shakti. He appears in a World Music Institute concert with his brother U. Rajesh, who also plays the mandolin. At 8, Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, (212) 545-7536; $30; $15 for students. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>MATMOS (Tonight) M. C. Schmidt and Drew Daniel of the San Francisco electronic group Matmos make music out of almost any found sounds: playing cards being shuffled, the slurping of liposuction, even melting ice. The effect can be lighthearted and playful or eerily disconcerting, as on one track on the group's latest album, ''The Rose Has Teeth in the Mouth of the Beast'' (Matador), in which robotic voices discuss ''pain in someone else's body'' over the mechanical ticking of typewriters. At 7, Whitney Museum of American Art, (800) 944-8639; free with pay-what-you-wish museum admission, but a $75 season pass to the Whitney Live series guarantees a seat. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>MINDLESS SELF INDULGENCE (Thursday) Bands merging high-adrenaline industrial rock with a carnival-of-freaks theatricality had a pretty good run in the 90's, the era of Ministry, My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult and Marilyn Manson. But fans are not ready to put away their black lipstick just yet, if the grass-roots success of this New York group is any indication. This show kicks off four nights at Avalon, two already sold out. 8 p.m., 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780 or (212) 307-7171; sold out. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>THURSTON MOORE (Wednesday) Mr. Moore, one of the guitarists in Sonic Youth and an eternal symbol of casually omnivorous eclecticism, plays two sets of improvisations, the first solo and the second with unnamed guests. 8 and 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; $10 per set. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>NORTEC COLLECTIVE (Tonight) A loose confederation of musicians and visual artists, the Nortec Collective is devoted to the cutting, rearranging and pasting of norteño -- the vibrant border style of accordions and oompah brass known on this side of the border as Tex-Mex. At midnight, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940; $15 in advance, $18 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* PELICAN, MONO (Tuesday) It's almost a misnomer to call Pelican a metal band. This four-piece instrumental group does indeed play loud, chunky power chords in the Melvins tradition, but with a sense of tragic drama that keeps the songs at a slow, reflective pace. With Mono, an instrumental group from Japan that flies from light turbulence into magnificent storms of noise. 8 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780 or (212) 307-7171; $15 in advance, $16 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>PINBACK (Tuesday and Wednesday) This band from San Diego, centered on Zach Smith and Rob Crow, makes modesty a virtue. Its songs move at deliberate speed with glimmers of twanged guitar or electronic blips; its vocals are conversational, full of disappointment and wistful hopes. With Pleaseeasaur. Tuesday at 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; sold out. Wednesday at 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $16 in advance and $18 at the door. (Jon Pareles)</p>
        <p>* JOSH RITTER, HEM (Tonight) A guileless, boy-next-door voice is the first clue that Mr. Ritter doesn't need a lot of fancy tricks to make a point. Powerfully minimal songwriting is another. But there is no limit to the depth and ambition of his songs, whether he is confessing a simple crush or following his thoughts on a long, Whitmanesque incantation, as he does for more than nine minutes on ''Thin Blue Flame'' from his new album, ''The Animal Years'' (V2). Hem plays somewhat prosaic alt-country, but in such delicate, sensuous arrangements that it doesn't matter. At 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; sold out. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>SAW DOCTORS (Thursday) The Saw Doctors sing earnest, folk-rocking anthems of small-town life ''for those who feel they've been mistreated/Discriminated, robbed or cheated.'' In Ireland their populism has brought them a huge national following; even in New York City, there should be plenty of voices with brogues singing along. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $26.50 in advance, $30 at the door. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>OBIE TRICE (Tuesday) Obie Trice emerged a few years ago as a solid protégé of Eminem; 50 Cent made his appearance around the same time, though, and most of the world forgot about Eminem's other protégés. But Mr. Trice has remained a good soldier. His new single, ''Snitch,'' is a humorless warning to a stool pigeon: ''This act is not permitted.'' Gulp! 9 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940; $15 in advance, $18 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>Cabaret</p>
        <p>Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.</p>
        <p>* KAREN AKERS (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) This regal cabaret singer and the brassy songs of Kander and Ebb that she is offering in her new show may not be an obvious fit. But Ms. Akers locates the heart inside the brass and sass. At 9 p.m., with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 11:30, Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; cover, $60, with a $20 minimum; $60 prix fixe dinner required on Thursdays and at the early shows tonight and tomorrow. (Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday) Even when swinging out, this Lady of a Thousand Songs remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. At 2 p.m., the Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $58, including brunch at noon. (Holden)</p>
        <p>BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package. (Holden)</p>
        <p>ANNIE ROSS (Wednesday) Cool, funny, swinging and indestructible, this 75-year-old singer and sometime actress exemplifies old-time hip in its most generous incarnation. At 9:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $12 minimum. (Holden)</p>

        <p>Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.</p>
        <p>MEMORIAL FOR DEREK BAILEY (Through May 31) The iconoclastic guitarist Derek Bailey had originally intended to perform with many of the artists he assembled for this monthlong run, which now serves as a fitting tribute. Highlights in the coming week include a percussion duo of Cyro Baptista and Billy Martin (tomorrow), an evening with the noise-rock guitarist Thurston Moore (Wednesday) and a group called Audible Means, led by the bassist Lisle Ellis (Thursday). At 8 and 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Nate Chinen)</p>
        <p>STEVEN BERNSTEIN'S MILLENNIAL TERRITORY ORCHESTRA (Thursday) Led by the slide trumpeter Steven Bernstein, this little big band dusts off an obscure swing-era repertory with showmanship and irreverence. At 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $12. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>ANDY BEY (Through Sunday) Intimacy is a hallmark of Mr. Bey's vocal style, which alternates between a rich baritone and a burnished falsetto. He's also a fine pianist, as he'll demonstrate with this quartet featuring the guitarist Paul Meyers. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25 and $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>BISHOP-CLEAVER-FLOOD (Wednesday) As on his new album, ''Time and Imaginary Time'' (Envoi), the saxophonist Andrew Bishop engages in a communicative exchange with the drummer Gerald Cleaver and the bassist Tim Flood, expanding compositional frames and exploring open space.

        <p>GERALD CLEAVER'S VIOLET HOUR (Tomorrow) Mr. Cleaver's suggestive pulse as a drummer has served him well in both conventional and experimental settings. His less heralded compositional vision guides this project, with the trumpeter Jeremy Pelt, the saxophonists J. D. Allen and Andrew Bishop, the pianist Ben Waltzer and the bassist Chris Lightcap. At 9 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)</p>

        <p>DAVE DOUGLAS QUINTET (Through Sunday) The trumpeter Dave Douglas always seems on the verge of forming a new band, but this one -- with Uri Caine on piano and Fender Rhodes; James Genus on bass; and Clarence Penn on drums -- has been a solid entity for several years. Here they celebrate a new album, ''Meaning and Mystery'' (Greenleaf), and a valuable new member, the tenor saxophonist Donny McCaslin.

        <p>SCOTT FEINER'S PANDEIRO JAZZ (Tomorrow) Mr. Feiner treats the pandeiro, a tambourinelike Brazilian hand drum, as an expressive jazz instrument; he sets out to prove his point in this ensemble, with the saxophonist Joel Frahm, the guitarist Freddie Bryant and the bassist Doug Weiss. At 11 p.m. and 12:30 a.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662; cover, $15. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>FLY (Tuesday through May 14) The tenor saxophonist Mark Turner, the bassist Larry Grenadier and the drummer Jeff Ballard make up this collaborative trio, which eschews the usual horn-plus-rhythm hierarchy in the service of an elastic group ideal. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20; Friday and Saturday, $25; with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>VINCENT GARDNER-NICHOLAS PAYTON QUINTET (Tuesday through May 14) The John Coltrane album ''Blue Trane'' serves as conceptual fodder for this hard-bop ensemble, which features Mr. Payton on trumpet, Mr. Gardner on trombone and Walter Blanding Jr. on tenor saxophone. Leading the rhythm section is the capable pianist Marc Cary. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set Fridays and Saturdays, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>KENNY GARRETT QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Garrett is a bulldozer on the alto saxophone, which he applies to blazing post-Coltrane calisthenics; he's also an introspective artisan on the soprano, with which he investigates East Asian folk timbres. At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $30 and $40 , with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>DAVID GILMORE GROUP (Tomorrow) Mr. Gilmore favors the clean guitar tone of George Benson, but his playing tends more toward an African rhythmic concept and a slippery melodic sense. He works with players equal to the task: Ravi Coltrane on tenor and soprano saxophones, Luis Perdomo on piano, Brad Jones on bass and Terreon Gully on drums. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063; cover, $15; members, $10. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>STEFON HARRIS AND KENNY BARRON (Wednesday) Mr. Barron is the leading practitioner of an elegant, economical piano style that thrives in any mainstream setting; Mr. Harris is a firecracker of a vibraphonist with a brightly dynamic style. They should make for fascinating duet partners. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330.; $25. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>FRED HERSCH AND NANCY KING (Tuesday through Thursday) Mr. Hersch, the pianist, has worked memorably with the elite jazz vocalists of our era; Ms. King isn't reflexively included in those ranks, but that's certainly through no fault of her own. This duo engagement, coming on the heels of a new MaxJazz album, should bring out the best in both of them. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>JESSICA LURIE ENSEMBLE (Tuesday) Playing saxophone, flute and accordion as well as singing, Ms. Lurie wears many hats in this exploratory but often melodic group.

At 10 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $10. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>KATE McGARRY (Monday) Ms. McGarry is a quiet but potent singer who recasts jazz and folk material alike with a quavering sincerity.

At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $15.(Chinen)</p>
        <p>NEW ORLEANS: CONGO SQUARE (Tonight and tomorrow night) Jazz at Lincoln Center concludes its city-hopping season with a focus on New Orleans, a place that had deep resonance for the organization long before Hurricane Katrina. In the Rose Theater, Wynton Marsalis and the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra present new music inspired by Congo Square, with help from the African percussionists Yacub Addy and Odadaa. In the Allen Room, the trombonist Wycliffe Gordon plays spirituals and gospel tunes. At 7:30 in the Allen Room, 8 in the Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500; $105.50 and $135.50. (Chinen)</p>

At 8, 10 and 11:30, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662; cover, $25. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>PAUL SHAPIRO'S MIDNIGHT MINYAN (Tuesday) As on his new album ''It's in the Twilight'' (Tzadik), Mr. Shapiro, a tenor saxophonist, transforms the ritual of a Friday night Shabbat service into a rollicking downtown jam. His co-conspirators are Steven Bernstein on slide trumpet, Peter Apfelbaum on tenor saxophone, Brian Mitchell on piano, Booker King on bass and Tony Lewis on drums. At 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $10. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>MCCOY TYNER TRIO WITH SAVION GLOVER (Tuesday through May 14) The rumbling sweep of Mr. Tyner's piano playing provokes a strong response from Mr. Glover, the paragon of rhythmic tap dance. It also interacts powerfully with the accompaniment of Charnett Moffett on bass and Eric Kamau Gravatt on drums. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $45 at tables, with a $5 minimum, or $30 at the bar, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)</p>

        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>* 'LOHENGRIN' (Tomorrow) The revival of Robert Wilson's 1998 production is not the same show that earned the director lusty boos at its premiere. The abstract sets, with luminous bars of white light against a mystical blue backdrop, are as haunting as ever. But this time the singers seem far more comfortable with the glacial movements and stylized hand and arm gestures, which have been simplified. The German tenor Klaus Florian Vogt, in his Met debut appearances, sings the title role, taking over for Ben Heppner. The charismatic soprano Karita Mattila, as Elsa, is in glorious voice. The conductor Philippe Auguin draws pulsing and incisive playing from the Met orchestra. 7:15 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $150 and $220 tickets remaining.(Anthony Tommasini)</p>
        <p>'RIGOLETTO' (Tuesday) Though Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazón, the opera world's hottest soprano-tenor couple, have moved on to other things, Verdi's ''Rigoletto'' is still with us at the Met, but with an entirely new cast from the one that sang it earlier this season. Paolo Gavanelli sings the title role, with Norah Amsellem as Gilda and Roberto Aronica as the Duke, Italian opera's most caddish character. Asher Fisch conducts. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $175.(Tommasini)</p>
        <p>* 'TOSCA' (Tonight, Monday and Thursday) Deborah Voigt will not be everyone's idea of a Tosca. Her bright and penetrating singing recalls the Nordic sound and temperament of Birgit Nilsson's in the role. But Ms. Voigt invests the character with personal touches, bringing out Tosca's vulnerability, and sings with daring abandon during the intense confrontation with the villainous Scarpia, here the veteran bass James Morris, who sounds terrific. The tenor Franco Farina is an ardent if sometimes bellowing Cavaradossi. (On Thursday, Eduardo Villa takes over for Mr. Farina and Greer Grimsley replaces Mr. Morris.) Carlo Rizzi conducts. Tonight at 8, Monday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $205 tonight, with limited availability; sold out Monday; $100 and $175 tickets remaining on Thursday.

(Jeremy Eichler)</p>
        <p>* IAN BOSTRIDGE AND LEIF OVE ANDSNES (Tomorrow) In a series of EMI recordings together, the British tenor Ian Bostridge and the Norwegian pianist Leif Ove Andsnes have proved to be a remarkably eloquent team, and of course, they have done wonders on their own as well. In this joint recital, they share the spotlight, with Mr. Andsnes opening the program with Beethoven's Sonata No. 31 and then joining Mr. Bostridge for a selection of Schubert songs. Mr. Andsnes is also giving a recital -- the same Beethoven sonata, as well as works by Schumann, Mendelssohn and Mussorgsky -- as part of the Peoples' Symphony Concerts series on Sunday afternoon. Mr. Bostridge and Mr. Andsnes perform tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; sold out.

        <p>CAMERATA SALZBURG (Sunday) Sir Roger Norrington and his Camerata Salzburg offered a provocative Beethoven symphony cycle at Alice Tully Hall in 2003. They return with a program that includes the Bartok Divertimento and two works by Haydn: the Piano Concerto in D, with Alexei Lubimov, and the Symphony No. 92. 2 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $56.

        <p>* EMERSON STRING QUARTET (Thursday) Among the great composers of the 20th century, Shostakovich was the most inscrutable. But in his 15 string quartets he came closest to showing his hand. These works are like entries in a diary and he never imagined that they would become as popular as they are today. The Emerson Quartet plays these seminal works compellingly and has recorded them complete. They are performing them all, in chronological order. The fourth of five programs offers Nos. 10, 11 and 12. 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $60. (Tommasini)</p>

(Dunning)</p>
        <p>THIS THAT DANCE COLLECTIVE (Thursday) Lauren Hale, Jessica Gaynor and Aimee Rials, who began to work with one another in college, will present dances they describe as explorations of the relationships between dance and music, lovers and friends, word and gesture and public and private spaces.

        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>* American Folk Art Museum: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY),' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. Few exhibitions this size (35 pieces) present quite such a vivid and rewarding picture of artistic assimilation and transformation. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith)</p>
        <p>* BARD GRADUATE CENTER: 'AMERICAN STREAMLINED DESIGN: THE WORLD OF TOMORROW,' through June 11. Streamlining, a particularly American design concept born of our love of speed and admiration for industrial production, peaked in the 1930's and 40's, and is now said to be undergoing a revival. This tribute to it includes more than 180 objects, from boring but useful items like a receipt printer designed by Walter Dorwin Teague in 1946 to a plastic bicycle helmet of flowing teardrop shapes designed by John Larkin in 2000. The show is perhaps too packed with repetitive examples -- do we need to see three similar electric drills? -- but don't let that stop you. There's no shortage of wonderful things to look at here. 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000. (Grace Glueck)</p>
        <p>* BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000.(Glueck)</p>
        <p>* Brooklyn Museum: WILLIAM WEGMAN: 'FUNNEY/STRANGE,' through May 28. Descended from Marcel Duchamp and Buster Keaton, Mr. Wegman has straddled high and low for more than three decades, using his signature Weimaraners to make the art world's funniest videos, as well as television commercials, calendars and children's books. (See above.) (Smith)</p>
        <p>DAHESH MUSEUM OF ART: 'Stories to Tell: Masterworks from the Kelly Collection of American Illustration,' through May 21. During the Golden Age of Illustration -- the 1880's to the 1930's -- images made by painters for magazines and books captivated the collective American psyche. Original works by some of the best of those artists, including J. C. Leyendecker, N. C. Wyeth and Charles Dana Gibson, are included in this extensive and well-selected exhibition. 580 Madison Avenue, near 57th Street, (212) 759-0606. (Ken Johnson)</p>
        <p>* FRICK COLLECTION: 'GOYA's LAST WORKS,' through May 14. This compact show is sublime. The most humane portraits are mixed with sketches, like diary entries, in which society is an irredeemable mob of lunatics and murderers. In exile in Bordeaux, Goya spent his last days in physical misery, lamenting man's essential evil while experimenting with the new medium of lithography and inventing the most exquisite, luminous paintings on tiny chips of ivory. Like the late works of Titian or Rembrandt, Goya's late works achieve a whole new level of freedom and depth, haunted by death but exalted. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Michael Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>* FRICK COLLECTION: 'VERONESE'S ALLEGORIES: VIRTUE, LOVE AND EXPLORATION IN RENAISSANCE VENICE,' through July 16. Paolo Veronese (1528-88), a superb colorist and one of the most suavely sensuous of Renaissance Venetian painters, used the age-old device of allegory to make abstract concepts visual, often by means of human or mythological figures. In this five-painting show, the first to include all of his large-scale allegories from American collections, high ideals mingle with earthy and sometimes erotic physicality, as in the painting ''Venus and Mars United by Love.'' (See above.) (Glueck)</p>
        <p>* Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum: 'David Smith: A Centennial,' through May 14. David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces that the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. (212) 423-3500.(Holland Cotter)</p>
        <p>* International Center of Photography: 'Snap Judgments: New Positions in Contemporary African Photography,' through May 28. If Martians tuned into our television news broadcasts, they'd have a miserable impression of life on Earth. War, disease, poverty, heartbreak and nothing else. That's exactly how most of the world sees Africa: filtered through images of calamity. The Nigerian-born curator Okwui Enwezor offers a bracing alternative view in this show of recent photography from Africa. He isn't interested in simply exchanging an upbeat Africa for a downbeat one, smiles for frowns, but in engineering a slow, complex, panoptical turn in perspective, one that takes in many moods and directions. The results are stimulating, astringent, brimming with life. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'HATSHEPSUT,' through July 9. Can a queen be a king, too? Consider the case of Hatshepsut, an Egyptian ruler of the 15th century B.C. She assumed the supreme title of pharaoh and ruled Egypt in that powerfully masculine role until her death. Hatshepsut is the subject of a celebratory show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one that commemorates the 100th anniversary of the Met's department of Egyptian art. Organized by the Met and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, it includes many objects from the Met's own extensive holdings, excavated at its digs in the 1920's and 30's. But it isn't so easy to follow Hatshepsut's trail in this ambitious show, what with the number of relatives, subordinates, minor officials and such who also have a place in it, along with scarabs, jewelry, pottery, furniture and other artifacts. (212) 535-7710. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>* Morgan Library and Museum: 'Masterworks from the Morgan,'  through Sept. 10. Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's splendid four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels, medieval objects made with so much silver and gold that they seem to give off heat. What's not new: almost everything in this celebratory exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts, as well as illuminated gospels, devotional sculptures and historical and literary autograph manuscripts from the Brontes to Bob Dylan. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or themorgan.org. ( Individual show closings can be checked by telephone or through the Web site.) (Cotter)</p>
        <p>* The Museum of Modern Art: 'Without Boundary: Seventeen Ways of Looking,' through May 22. This excellent group show considers what ''Islamic'' means in the work of several contemporary artists, and it means many things, none simple. Just to see the uses made of calligraphy by Shirazeh Houshiary, Rachid Koraichi and Shirin Neshat is to understand the lesson in variety put forward here. At the same time, the show is far from didactic. It's beautiful, sexy and, in the case of Raqib Shaw's painting and Kutlug Ataman's video of Sufi meditation, ecstatic. (212) 708-9400. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>NEUE GALERIE: 'KLEE AND AMERICA,' through May 22. For a long time, the Swiss-born artist Paul Klee (1879-1940), regarded as a leading Modernist figure in Europe, didn't believe his delicate, chimerical work had much of a future in the United States. Yet, thanks to artists, collectors and dealers with close contacts in Germany who had begun to discover his work, by the early 1920's, Klee's impact began to be felt here. This show of more than 60 paintings and drawings assembled exclusively from American holdings covers the wide spectrum of Klee's work. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>* The Studio Museum In harlem: 'Energy/Experimentation: Black Artists and Abstraction, 1964-1980,' through July 2. During one of the most radical periods in 20th-century American politics, the Black Power era, a group of African-American artists was working in one of the most radical forms of 20th-century art: abstraction. This show is stylishly installed; the 15 artists are intensely individualistic and part of an important history. One, the sculptor Tom Lloyd (1921-96), opened the Studio Museum with a solo show in 1968. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Whitney Museum of American Art: 'WHITNEY BIENNIAL 2006: DAY FOR NIGHT,' through May 28. This biennial will provoke much head-scratching by uninitiated visitors. A hermetic take on what has been making waves, it's packaged -- branded might be the better word -- as a show long on collaboration and open-endedness: several shows under one roof, including a revival of the 1960's ''Peace Tower,'' which rises like a Tinker Toy construction from the Whitney courtyard, with contributions by dozens of artists. As a counter to the image of the art world as rich, youth-besotted and obsessed with crafty little nothings, the ethos here is provisional, messy, half-baked, cantankerous, insular -- radical qualities art used to have when it could still call itself radical and wasn't like a barnacle clinging to the cruise ship of pop culture. That was back in the 1970's. And much of what's here (including works by bohemians and other senior eccentrics around then) harks back to that moment. (800) 944-8639 or www.whitney.org. (Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>Galleries: 57th Street</p>
        <p>* 'Great Pots: The Vessel as Art, 1900 to 2000' This extraordinarily rich and varied lobby show presents 164 works by 143 artists from the Newark Museum's famed ceramics collection. It focuses on utilitarian vessels -- vases, bowls, pots, mugs and platters -- but covers an enormous amount of aesthetic territory, taking in Pueblo Indian, Arts and Crafts, classical Japanese, European Modernist, Pop, funk and much more. The show includes great craftsmen like George Orr, Beatrice Wood, Peter Voulkos and Ron Nagel. The UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, near 51st Street, (212) 713-2885, through May 19. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Galleries: SoHo</p>
        <p>'The Garden Party' This crowded group show on the theme of the erotic garden looks as if it were produced by a college fraternity for its spring festival. It includes high-profile artists like Vanessa Beecroft, Olafur Eliasson and Yoko Ono. Deitch Projects, 76 Grand Street, near Greene Street, (212) 343-7300, through May 13. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Hanna Liden: 'Hairfaces, Scapegoats, Birds, Bloodsuckers, Squareheads &amp; a Few Deaths' A Swedish artist who is in this year's Whitney Biennial, Ms. Liden produces staged color photographs that resemble stills from a low-budget gothic horror movie. With young people in tribal masks menaced by black shrouded figures of death in beautiful wilderness settings, they suggest a meeting of Ingmar Berman and ''The Road Warrior.'' Rivington Arms, 4 East Second Street, East Village, (646) 654-3213, through May 14. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>Ed Clark: 'Rebirth' Mr. Clark, who turns 80 on May 6, uses push brooms to sweep great quantities of paint across medium-large canvases, creating bold, suave and sensuous Abstract Expressionist evocations of oceanic flux. G. R. N'Namdi, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 929-6645, through May 11. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>* Lisa Ruyter: 'I Am a Camera'  This painter, known for colorful, photo-based, psychedelic cartoons, takes an exciting turn to black, white and many shades of gray in a series of large, psychologically resonant, finely outlined self-portraits. The nearly 16-foot-wide portrait of the artist, doubled in a mirror against an arboreal background, is a knockout. Team, 527 West 26th Street, (212) 279-9219, through May 13. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Robert Sholties: 'Evolution' A Pennsylvania postal worker with no formal art training, Mr. Sholties paints intensely detailed fantasy landscapes populated by wild and domestic animals and people who are often in South American costumes. Magical, allegorical and apocalyptic events occur, and themes of religion and ecological disaster are addressed in these visionary pictures. Ricco Maresca, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-4819, through May 13.(Johnson)</p>
        <p>Davor Vrankic With impressively skillful application of graphite on paper, this Paris-based Croatian artist creates darkly comical images of big-eyed, E.T.-like monsters who appear to be undergoing some terrible psychological suffering. The Proposition, 559 West 22nd Street, (212) 242-0035, through May 13. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Other Galleries</p>
        <p>'An American Abroad: Sandra Fisher and her School of London Friends' Fisher, who was married to the painter R. B. Kitaj, was an American who lived in London until her death in 1994 at age 47. This show of more than 60 drawings and paintings, mostly portraits or nudes, reveals a modestly talented traditionalist with a deft, painterly touch and a down-to-earth affection for her subjects. Also included are some portraits of Fisher by artists like Frank Auerbach, Avigdor Arikha and Mr. Kitaj. New York Studio School, 8 West Eighth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 673-6466, through May 13. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Ken Butler: 'Instrumental Desire: Strings Attached' Trained as a classical musician and as a painter, Mr. Butler is a performance artist who produces electronically amplified music on unlikely stringed instruments that he constructs himself out of found objects and parts of real instruments. This jam-packed exhibition presents 79 instruments made from things like a rifle, an old sled, a leaf rake and a metal detector. Sideshow, 319 Bedford Avenue, at South Second Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 486-8180, through May 14. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>* ECHOES FROM THE STEPPES: MONGOLIAN 17TH-, 18TH- AND 19TH-CENTURY BRONZES AND PAINTINGS The bronzes represent the four styles of Mongolian religious sculpture, but the main event is the 77 sakhuis paintings -- small, finely wrought, richly colored portraits of Buddhist priests and protective or wrathful deities that the nomadic Mongols wore, framed in silver, as amulets. E. &amp; J. Frankel, 1040 Madison Avenue, at 79th Street, (212) 879-5733; closes tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'EDVARD MUNCH: THE MODERN LIFE OF THE SOUL'  This affecting, full-scale retrospective is the first survey of this Norwegian painter in an American museum in almost 30 years. Its more than 130 oils and works on paper cover Munch's entire career, from 1880 to 1944. (212) 708-9400; closes on Monday. (Because of the popularity of the show, museum hours will be extended tomorrow to 8 p.m.) (Glueck)</p>
        <p>James Harrison: 'The Future is in the Past' Densely worked, visionary paintings and drawings like the ones in this fascinating show have made Harrison (1925-90) a figure of cultlike devotion for certain local artists. Luise Ross, 511 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 343-2161; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Gedi Sibony and Josh Smith These cool, dry hipsters provoke a mildly irate perplexity. Mr. Smith roughly paints his own name in large, blocky letters on collages and stretched store-bought fabric. Mr. Sibony has placed sheets of cardboard, plywood, sheetrock and perforated metal around the gallery; removed part of a gallery wall; and covered part of one room with nondescript carpet. Harris Lieberman, 89 Vandam Street, at Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 206-1290; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Amy Sillman With sensuous verve Ms. Sillman mixes a number of different painterly languages in her appealing but uncertainly focused paintings: Abstract Expressionism, Cubism, Constructivism and primitivistic image-making. Sikkema Jenkins, 530 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-2262; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)</p>
