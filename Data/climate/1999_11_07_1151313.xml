        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>Scene: The Mall at Short Hills.</p>
        <p>A young woman tells her boyfriend, ''No, I don't like that tie.''</p>
        <p>''Why?'' her boyfriend asks.</p>
        <p>To which she replies, ''It doesn't match my dress.''</p>
        <p>In a local university cafeteria, the menu said, ''Filet of Fish.''</p>
        <p>I asked the person at the counter, ''What kind of fish?''</p>
        <p>She responded, ''Filet of fish.''</p>
        <p>With a touch of exasperation, I said, ''Yes, I know, but a filet of what?''</p>
        <p>With even more exasperation -- and perhaps a roll of her eyes, she said, ''Fish.''</p>
        <p>I got the chicken.</p>
        <p>(Yes, but what kind of chicken?)</p>

        <p>CAMPAIGN PROMISES</p>
        <p>They promise they'll restore the ozone layer,</p>
        <p>Stop ocean dumping, filter acid rain,</p>
        <p>And banish hydrocarbons from our air.</p>
        <p>How come they can't conduct a clean campaign?</p>
        <p>BOB McKENTY</p>
        <p>How's this for a New Jersey proverb? Live each day as if it's your last because life is like the right lane on Interstate 287 -- you never know when it's going to end.</p>
        <p>WILLIAM DeBUVITZ</p>
        <p>It's fun reading to the 4-year-olds at the Morristown Township Library. I always remember their faces, but sometimes their names escape me.</p>
        <p>Recently I met one of our 5-year-old postgraduates on South Street.</p>
        <p>''Hi, Mrs. Meyer,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''Hi, how are you,'' I answered.</p>
        <p>Then she said, ''Do you remember me?''</p>
        <p>When I hesitated, she shot back, ''Does the name Nancy mean anything to you?''</p>
        <p>DORIS L. MEYER</p>
        <p>It was 11:30 on a recent sunny Friday morning when I was home from work caring for a sick child.</p>
        <p>The phone rings, after which a woman with a funereal voice says, ''Hello. Mrs. Gray, please.''</p>
        <p>''Speaking,'' I said.</p>
        <p>The funereal voice then proceeded: ''This is (unintelligible) Memorial Park in East Hanover. This number has been selected to receive free burial space from us.''</p>
        <p>How did she know I'm staring down the barrel of a major birthday and feeling vulnerable? That my eldest will soon be married and I'm feeling bumped up a generation? That in the time it took to address the invitations, two guests died?</p>
        <p>Telemarketers have tried to separate me from my money in many ways. But this is the first time the Grim Reaper called on a peaceful weekday morning. The next time, I hope she gets a busy signal.</p>
        <p>(Wonder if she'll settle for call waiting?)</p>
        <p>CAROL LIPPERT GRAY</p>
        <p>Big mistake. I had my hair cut, washed and dried, then rushed to the Division of Motor Vehicles to get a photograph taken for my driver's license. In my haste, I failed to check my face or hair before the photograph was taken.</p>
        <p>My funny-faced appearance on the license prompted me to say, ''That is scary.''</p>
        <p>Without hesitation, the clerk behind the counter replied: ''That is the way it is supposed to look. It's Halloween.''</p>
