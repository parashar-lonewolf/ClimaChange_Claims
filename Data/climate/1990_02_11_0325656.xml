        <p>LEAD: Instead of a self-help section, my local bookstore has a section called Recovery, right around the corner from the one called New Age.

        <p>Instead of a self-help section, my local bookstore has a section called Recovery, right around the corner from the one called New Age. It's stocked with books about addiction, psychic healing and codependency - a popular new disease blamed for such diverse disorders as drug abuse, alcoholism, anorexia, child abuse, compulsive gambling, chronic lateness, fear of intimacy and low self-esteem. Codependency, which originally referred to the problems of people married to alcoholics, was discovered by self-actualization experts about five years ago and redefined. Now it applies to any problem associated with any addiction suffered by you or someone close to you. This amorphous disease is a business, generating millions of book sales, countless support groups and, in September 1989, the First National Conference on Co-dependency in Scottsdale, Ariz. Codependency ''has arrived,'' according to a conference report; recovery is a national grass roots movement.</p>
        <p>Codependency is advertised as a national epidemic, partly because every conceivable form of arguably compulsive behavior is classified as an addiction. (We are a nation of sexaholics, rageaholics, shopaholics and rushaholics.) ''I have a feeling we're soon going to have special groups for third cousins of excessive sherry drinkers,'' the child psychologist Robert Coles told me. ''You don't know whether to laugh or cry over some of this stuff.'' The codependency movement has ''run amok,'' he said. It's a ''typical example of how anything packaged as psychology in this culture seems to have an all too gullible audience.''</p>
        <p>The codependency movement also exemplifies our fears of an enemy within and the demonization of addiction and disease. What were once billed as bad habits and problems - Cinderella and Peter Pan complexes, smart women loving too much and making foolish choices about men who hate them - are now considered addictions too, or reactions to the addictions of others, or both. Like drug and alcohol abuse, they're considered codependent diseases. If the self-help industry is any measure of our state of mind in 1990, we are indeed obsessed with disease and our will to defeat it: all codependency books stress the curative power of faith and self-discipline. It's morning after in America; we want to be in recovery.</p>
        <p>Almost everyone - 96 percent of all Americans - suffers from codependency, these self-proclaimed experts assert, and given their very broad definitions of this disease, we probably do. Melody Beattie, the best-selling author of ''Codependent No More'' and ''Beyond Codependency,'' defines codependency as being affected by someone else's behavior and obsessed with controlling it. Who isn't? Another definition comes from Anne Wilson Schaef, the author of the best-selling ''When Society Becomes an Addict'' and ''Co-dependence: Misunderstood - Mistreated,'' who calls it ''a disease process whose assumptions, beliefs and lack of spiritual awareness lead to a process of nonliving which is progressive.''</p>
        <p>That some readers think they know what this means is a tribute to what George Orwell considered reduced expectations of language and the substitution of attitudes and feelings for ideas. It is enough for Ms. Schaef to mean that codependency is bad and anyone can have it, which makes this condition seem more like a marketing device. Codependency offers a diagnosis, and support group, to virtually anyone with a problem who can read.</p>
        <p>The publishing industry, which didn't exactly invent codependency, is making sure that millions of Americans discover it. Such publishers as Harper &amp; Row, Prentice Hall and Thomas Nelson have special lines of recovery and ''wellness'' books. Harper's San Francisco branch, a leader in the field, lists about 80 recovery books, the majority of which are published in conjunction with the Hazelden Foundation, a leading treatment center for chemical dependency. Sales can fairly be called phenomenal: ''Codependent No More'' has enjoyed more than 70 weeks on the New York Times paperback best-seller list and, according to Harper &amp; Row, sales of about 1.5 million copies. Smaller publishers are also cashing in on what appears to be an insatiable market. Health Communications Inc., which specializes in paperback codependency books, has about 102 titles, including some best sellers. The company says that its top book, ''Adult Children of Alcoholics'' by Janet G. Woititz, has sold 1.1 million copies. Charles L. Whitfield's ''Healing the Child Within'' has sold more than 500,000 copies, and John Bradshaw's ''Bradshaw On: The Family'' has sold 350,000 copies. Peter Vegso, the president of Health Communications, said he expects sales for all their books to top three million this year.</p>
        <p>What's striking about all the codependency books on the market (I've read 21) is their sameness. They may differ in levels of literacy and how they balance the discussion of codependency theory with recovery techniques. But they describe the same syndromes in the same jargon and prescribe the same cure - enlistment in a support group that follows an overtly religious recovery program (stressing submission to a higher power) borrowed from Alcoholics Anonymous. Codependency books line the shelves in bookstores like different brands of aspirin in a drugstore. As Mr. Vegso said, ''A lot of people are looking at why they're not happy.''</p>
        <p>Their unhappiness begins at home, in the dysfunctional family, codependency authors stress, drawing heavily on family systems theory, explaining the way individuals develop in relation or reaction to their families. Codependency is attributed to child abuse, which makes it an intergenerational familial disease; child abuse, defined broadly to include any emotional or physical abandonment, disrespect or inadequate nurturance, begets child abuse, or anorexia and other forms of self-abuse. This is surely part of codependency's appeal. We are all fascinated by our families. No soap opera is more compelling than our own.</p>
        <p>Codependency books lead readers back through childhood to discover the ways in which they've been abused and the ''negative messages'' they've internalized. Exercises, quizzes and sentence-completion tests (for example, ''I have trouble owning my feeling reality around my father when. . . .'') assist readers in self-evaluation. You can estimate your codependency score, your place on a ''worry index'' or your PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) average. You can find your own pattern or syndrome in the usual assortment of case studies that track the children of abuse into adulthood. Readers are encouraged to reconstruct their pasts by drawing family trees that chart their legacy of disease: grandfather is an alcoholic, mother is a compulsive rescuer and Uncle Murray weighs 270 pounds; father is a sex addict, your sister is anorexic and you only have affairs with married men.</p>
        <p>Still, encased in silliness and jargon are some sound, potentially helpful insights into how character takes shape in the drama of family life. Codependency literature may reflect some of the often criticized selfism of the 1970's. (Ms. Beattie dedicates ''Codependent No More'' ''to me.'') But accusing self-help authors of selfism is like accusing fiction writers of making things up, and the concept of codependency does combine concern for self with the more recent focus on family and community. The self is never viewed in isolation: codependency theory places the struggle for individual identity in the context of familial relations.</p>
        <p>''We cannot have an identity all alone,'' Mr. Bradshaw writes in ''Bradshaw On: The Family.'' ''Our reality is shaped from the beginning by a relationship.'' Children in dysfunctional families are shaped by bad relationships and are improperly ''individuated.'' (Codependents are always said to suffer from ''boundary'' problems, confusion about where they end and other people begin.) Dysfunctional families sacrifice their members to the family system, Mr. Bradshaw suggests, in one of the more cogent explanations of codependency: ''The individual exists to keep the system in balance.''</p>
        <p>In our culture, women have long been assigned primary responsibility for the family's emotional balance, and codependency is often described as a feminine disease. (Rooted in the model of a co-alcoholic wife, it's commonly associated with compulsive caretaking.) As Ms. Schaef says in ''Co-dependence: Misunderstood - Mistreated,'' the nonliberated woman ''gets her identity completely from outside herself; [she]  and the co-dependent are the same person.'' Although codependency books sound nonsexist (the third-person masculine is used, if at all, with apology) and many of the codependents described in them are men, they speak primarily to women. Mr. Vegso estimates that 85 percent of the codependency market is female.</p>
        <p>There are differing feminist perspectives on this mostly female phenomenon. Defining femininity as a disease is troubling because it overlooks the ways in which women are trapped in abuse by circumstance, not weakness. Charging codependent wives with complicity in their husbands' addictions may be, as the social critic Barbara Ehrenreich asserts, another way of ''blaming women'' for the crimes and failures of men. But while the view of a nonliberated woman as diseased is anathema to feminists who see her as oppressed, it's balanced by a view of liberation as healthy. Codependency theory shares some feminist ideals, often couched in New Age jargon: Mr. Bradshaw describes a good relationship as one ''based on equality, the equality of two self-actualizing spiritual beings who connect at the level of their beingness.''</p>
        <p>There are, however, few such beings in this culture, male or female, Mr. Bradshaw and others agree. Women are not alone in their pathology. Men are sick in complementary ways, and society itself is addicted to (among other things mentioned in these books) the arms race, the repression of emotion, the accumulation of capital and enlarging the hole in the ozone layer. These ''addictions'' partly reflect what is implicitly condemned as the disease of masculinity: rationalist left-brain thinking. As Ms. Schaef explains in ''When Society Becomes an Addict,'' the ''White Male System'' is addictive, and it's the only system we know.</p>
        <p>This view of codependency as a pervasive, institutionalized disease not only provides codependency authors with the widest possible audience - everyone - it imbues them with messianic zeal. Codependency is, after all, considered fatal, for individuals, corporations and the nation. It causes cancer and other stress-related diseases, these books warn, as well as business failures, environmental pollution and war.</p>
        <p>If society and everyone in it are addicted, self-destructing, infected with left-brain rationality, then people in recovery are the chosen few, an elite minority of enlightened, if irrational, self-actualizers with the wisdom to save the world. As Ms. Schaef confirms, the only people who can help cure our addictive system are those ''recovering from its effects.''</p>
        <p>Experts themselves must thus admit that they're recovering codependents too, and codependency books tend to be partly confessional, following a model of the expert as patient taken from A.A.: ''Hello! My name is Carla and I am recovering from just about every addiction known to humanity,'' Carla Wills-Brandon perkily reveals at the beginning of ''Is It Love or Is It Sex?'' Personal experience with addiction and recovery is as important a credential as professional degrees, partly because the therapeutic profession itself is considered a nest of practicing codependents. Lynne Namka, the author of ''The Doormat Syndrome,'' advises you to choose a therapist ''who has fewer psychological problems than you do.''</p>
        <p>But if they decline to cloak themselves in the power of professional expertise, these writers who've ''been there'' invoke the moral authority we grant survivors. Everyone wants to be a survivor, as if survivalhood were the only alternative to victimization. ''QUAKE SURVIVOR RELOCATES seeks 'humanistic' male,'' a recent personal ad in The New York Review of Books explains. ''I survived'' the subway strike, the summer of '88, Hurricane Hugo, T-shirts attest. ''I survived codependency,'' people in recovery may boast, like figures at a New Yorker cartoon cocktail party. In recovery there are no victims -of incest, drug abuse or love - there are only survivors.</p>
        <p>The process of recovery (it's not an event, these experts repeatedly explain) brings even more than survival. The recovery ''life style'' eventually brings rebirth. Its goal is healing your inner child - the wounded child who took refuge from abuse and deprivation in a recess of your soul.</p>
        <p>Or, perhaps the inner child is the soul. ''We all carry within us an eternal child,'' Jeremiah Abrams writes in his introduction to ''Reclaiming the Inner Child,'' an eclectic anthology, to be published next month, of academic and pop essays about the child within that are alternately eloquent, intelligent, trite and incomprehensible. Inner-child theory is an equally eclectic synthesis of Jung, New Age mysticism, holy-children mythology, pop psychology and psychoanalytic theories about narcissism and the creation of a false self that wears emotions without experiencing them.</p>
        <p>Codependency, which includes narcissism, is generally described as a failure to feel, or a failure to feel what's true. Addiction masks true feelings and the true, childlike self. Codependents are considered adult children. If some behave more like Scrooge than Peter Pan, all have a Tiny Tim within.</p>
        <p>Inner children are always good - innocent and pure - like the most sentimentalized Dickens characters, which means that people are essentially good and, most of all, redeemable. Even Ayatollah Khomeini had a child within. Think of little Adolf Hitler abandoned in his crib. Evil is merely a mask - a dysfunction. The therapeutic view of evil as sickness, not sin, is particularly strong in codependency theory. Shaming children, calling them bad, is a primary form of abuse. Both guilt and shame ''are not useful as a way of life,'' Ms. Beattie writes in ''Codependent No More.'' ''We need to forgive ourselves. . . . Guilt makes everything harder.'' This is not moral relativism; distinctions are made between healthy and unhealthy behavior. It reflects instead the need to believe that no one is unforgivable and everyone can be saved. Because within every addict there's a holy child yearning to be free, recovery holds the promise of redemption.</p>
        <p>Its religiosity distinguishes codependency literature from the predominant personal development and relationship books of the 70's and early 80's. Books like ''The Cinderella Complex'' by Colette Dowling, or ''How to Get Whatever You Want Out of Life'' by Joyce Brothers, focus on mental, not spiritual, health; on happiness, self-confidence, love and success in the temporal world, not salvation. Codependency literature combines the pop psychology and pop feminism of these books with New Age spiritualism and some traditional evangelical ideals: addiction and recovery look a lot like sin and redemption. Addiction is often described as enthrallment to a false god; recovery leads you to the true. The suffering associated with addiction is purposeful and purifying, and it prepares you to serve: ''Without my suffering, I would not be able to bear witness,'' Mr. Bradshaw says. Sin can be the low road to redemption, as Jimmy Swaggart made clear. Codependents take a familiar confessional pride in their disorders, as if every addiction were a crucible.</p>
        <p>The disease of codependency is probably millennium fever. Everybody wants to be reborn, and in recovery, everybody is. No matter how bad you've been in the narcissistic 70's and the acquisitive 80's, no matter how many drugs you've ingested, or sex acts performed, or how much corruption enjoyed, you're still essentially innocent: the divine child inside you is always untouched by the worst of your sins. This relentless optimism drove me to Kafka (that incorrigibly unrepentant codependent) and to some old-fashioned preaching. God issues a lot of negative messages (thou shalt nots), Harlan J. Wechsler reminds us in ''What's So Bad About Guilt?,'' a sensible, if avuncular, defense of conscience and rationality. Use your intellect to make moral judgments and devise constructive punishments for yourself and others, he heretically suggests. If your husband leaves you for a younger woman, ''berate him, punish him, and make his life miserable.''</p>
        <p>Of course, there is no revenge in recovery and little Old Testament justice. God issues only cloying positive messages - affirmations, like ''You are lovable.'' Chanting affirmations to yourself daily is an important recovery technique. ''Energy follows thought,'' Ms. Namka reports in ''The Doormat Syndrome.'' ''You actually become what you think.'' Develop a ''happiness habit'' by thinking happy thoughts and avoiding ''worry conversations,'' Norman Vincent Peale advised in his 50's best seller ''The Power of Positive Thinking.'' Imagine yourself succeeding and you will, like the Little Engine That Could.</p>
        <p>Codependency authors are not nearly so materialistic or oblivious to social injustice as Dr. Peale, who believes most problems are caused by bad attitudes; nor do they claim recovery will be easy. But they owe him much - the reliance on simple, universal techniques to facilitate individual change and the belief that we need never be victims of circumstance, that the wounds of childhood need not be fatal. Codependency experts share with Dr. Peale the conviction that each of us carries within the power to heal ourselves, that happiness, health and wisdom are acts of will, grounded in faith.</p>
        <p>Faith healing has long been part of the self-help tradition, as the popularity of Christian Science attests (Mary Baker Eddy was an author too). In the self-help universe, anyone can be healthy, spiritually centered, rich and thin - with faith, self-discipline and the willingness to take direction. This hopeful pragmatism is supposed to be singularly American, and we tend to be as proud of the self-help tradition as we are enamored of the notion that we are a country of people forever inventing ourselves.</p>
        <p>But if the how-to phenomenon reflects a democratic belief in the power of will to overcome circumstances of nature and class, it's built on an authoritarian mystique of expertise that encourages conformity. Experts pretend to divulge secrets to readers, mystifying the obvious in jargon and italics. Experts are always unique (their tritest pronouncements are packaged as news), but readers are fungible, suffering the same syndromes and needful of the same cures. Self-help books collectivize the process of identity formation, exploiting readers' fears of embarking on the search for self without the aid of exercises, techniques, assurances of success and, of course, support groups.</p>
        <p>To criticize the conformity implicit in self-help, you needn't deny the solace people find in collectivity or suggest that they are better off pursuing their addictions individually than curing them in groups. You needn't question the sincerity of recovery proselytizers or even the benefits offered by a few profiteers: we are all better off if addicts consume only books. We will all survive recovery. But what of the passivity and search for simple absolutes the recovery movement reflects?</p>
        <p>Codependency authors say that recovery is ultimately an individual journey, but readers are not expected to find their paths or their transport techniques alone. There is little solitude and no isolation in recovery: outside your support group you're with God. Recovery requires much less than self-help; it requires self-surrender, to a higher power or cosmic truth or other nondenominational universal force.</p>
        <p>This isn't the narcissism commonly associated with self-help so much as submission; it isn't individualism so much as a hunger to belong. The putative message of codependency - that we are responsible for ourselves and shouldn't spend our lives heeding or pleasing others - is undermined by the medium in which it's conveyed. Merely buying a self-help book is an act of dependence, a refusal to confront the complexities of a solitary creative effort, as well as its failures.</p>
        <p>Of course, to the extent that codependency and other self-help books discourage independent thought, they're part of a frequently bemoaned trend associated with television and the decline of public education. Intellectuals, right and left, complain about the debasement of public discourse the way fundamentalist preachers complain about sex. Still (to complain just a little), recently the self-help syndrome has made a significant contribution to the general dumbing down of books and begun changing the relationship between writers and readers. Today, even critical books about ideas are expected to be prescriptive, to conclude with 10- or 12-point recovery plans for whatever crisis they discuss. Like politicians, writers are not generally supposed to raise problems they can't readily solve. Publishers want writers to answer questions for readers, not ask them, and popular books about ideas are often merely bromides or harangues. Reading itself is becoming, perversely, a way out of thinking.</p>
        <p>Codependency may soon be as passe as last year's diet, but the self-help genre will always be in fashion. Self-help books market authority in a culture that idealizes individualism but not thinking and fears the isolation of being free. ''A book must be the axe for the frozen sea inside us,'' Kafka wrote. Self-help is how we skate.</p>
