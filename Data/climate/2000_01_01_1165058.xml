        <p>So now at last begins the year 2000, a juncture in time so long anticipated it is hard to believe it has arrived, disguised as a mere Saturday. The year is so utterly new, all four digits overturned at once, that simply seeing the date in print jars the eye.</p>
        <p>The very novelty of it -- this is the roundest year any of us will ever see -- suggests momentous change. In a practical sense, of course, that is far from true. What remained undone on Friday will still need doing on Monday. Yet there is no denying that we have arrived at the gateway to another epoch, and the moment commands respect and reflection about the world to come. In a thousand years, when people look back at what has preceded them, they will see that the chronicle of this new millennium began with us, on this day. We belong now to their history, as progenitors, in a different way than we did even yesterday.</p>

        <p>So now at last begins the year 2000, a juncture in time so long anticipated it is hard to believe it has arrived, disguised as a mere Saturday. The year is so utterly new, all four digits overturned at once, that simply seeing the date in print jars the eye.</p>
        <p>The very novelty of it -- this is the roundest year any of us will ever see -- suggests momentous change. In a practical sense, of course, that is far from true. What remained undone on Friday will still need doing on Monday. Yet there is no denying that we have arrived at the gateway to another epoch, and the moment commands respect and reflection about the world to come. In a thousand years, when people look back at what has preceded them, they will see that the chronicle of this new millennium began with us, on this day. We belong now to their history, as progenitors, in a different way than we did even yesterday.</p>
        <p>Ideals for Posterity</p>
        <p>When we gaze into a seeming infinity of tomorrows, we face the challenge that any generation confronts when it looks ahead: how to influence a future we cannot control or even predict. We can no more see the details of centuries yet to be than the residents of cultivated, tolerant, prosperous Baghdad in A.D. 1000 could imagine what their city would look like a millennium later under the tyranny of Saddam Hussein. We also recognize that no civilization lasts forever, and that America a thousand years hence will be something very different, if it exists at all.</p>
        <p>None of this, however, relieves us of the obligation to do what is within our power. That is to help form the future by bequeathing the best of what we have learned about constructing and sustaining an enlightened civilization. History teaches that the surest way to reach across time is through the transmission of enduring values and ideals. The convictions of Washington and Jefferson still guide us powerfully today, just as the ideas of the ancient Greeks and the Enlightenment philosophers emboldened them. We have a similar opportunity to inspire coming generations by projecting toward them the principles that we have honed in more recent times. They can be the distinctive legacy of our age.</p>
        <p>A Fresh Way of Seeing the World</p>
        <p>For we are the custodians of an attitudinal revolution that developed in the last decades of the century -- the final seconds, figuratively speaking, of the millennium. We have come to see the need to organize the world's affairs in ways that bridge territorial, political and cultural boundaries and to act in concert to protect the health of the earth itself.</p>
        <p>These ideas, now widely embraced, represent a seismic shift in how we think about the world, the relations between peoples and nations, and our relationship with the planet that is our home. Globalization has become a term of art for unifying trends in trade, communications and management. But it could as easily refer to a generous new consciousness about how the world should manage not just its enterprises and armies but the task of crafting a shared destiny.</p>
        <p>True, we have not ended bloodshed or eliminated ethnic violence, nor have we overcome poverty or defeated disease. The fact that this day arrives freighted with anxiety about terrorist attacks in our most joyous public spaces shows that we have not conquered the violence born of bigotry and political division. It would be naive, even reckless, to suggest that the world's problems do not weigh heavily as the centuries turn, and we do not mean to underestimate the dangers that may lie ahead.</p>
        <p>But in these first hours of a new era, it behooves us to imagine the future with a sense of optimism, something that eluded our ancestors as they struggled just to survive. We have the humane vision and technological means to lift the world family to new levels of liberty, affluence, health and happiness. Forging that possibility into reality is the task that greets us in the morning of the new millennium.</p>
        <p>Decisive Lessons</p>
        <p>The blinding flash and towering mushroom cloud that filled the sky over Alamogordo, N.M., on July 16, 1945, signaled the advent of a new world in which adversaries could unleash nature's most powerful forces. Less than 25 years later, three men peered back at Earth as they circled the moon, and from the porthole of their spacecraft that Christmas Eve in 1968 we could see how small, how wondrous our planet is as it floats in the black emptiness of space. The profound paradox of those images -- one deadly, one supernal -- has instructed the progressive nations of the world in the last years of the millennium.</p>
        <p>We had acquired the tools to deform the entire planet, and not with weapons alone. Unrestrained pollution and surging population growth are forces of equal, albeit more gradual, cataclysmic potential. Yet just at this point of paralyzing danger, we also gained the ability to see the earth as a miraculous and mendable entity, and to think and act in altruistic ways that would have been unimaginable just a few decades ago.</p>
        <p>The origins of this transforming process -- a universal learning experience that may in time be compared to the Renaissance -- can be found in the blossoming of democratic spirit in 18th-century revolutions. Later, industrialization demonstrated the life-changing potential of technology and inventiveness. The military conflicts of the last century created both a worldwide hunger for peace and a sharpened antipathy to totalitarian governance. The rising aspirations of Asia and Africa showed the futility of imperialism, while the United States and its Western partners, in their farsighted moments, were seeking to guide the world according to what Lincoln called the better angels of our nature.</p>
        <p>In more recent years this new perspective deepened with the recognition and fear that the technology of war had brought us to the edge of a disaster from which the world might never recover. But it also grew from the interconnectedness of the modern age, the realization that the welfare of a single nation could not be severed from the welfare of the entire world. More benign technologies -- airplanes, telephones, television -- spurred the process. Today, computers and the global communications network are all but erasing national boundaries and undercutting nationalism itself.</p>
        <p>A Different International Order</p>
        <p>Our political and economic models are changing as the cold war recedes. We have learned that our leaders should be judged not by their ability to defeat enemies or conquer new territories, but on their capacity to extend prosperity and peace. Because even small countries can obtain the weapons to threaten not just adjacent lands but distant capitals, every nation has a critical interest in seeing every other nation do well. In the Middle East and most recently in the Balkans, the United States and its allies have found common purpose in combating regional bloodlettings and preventing rogue nations from acquiring biological, chemical and nuclear arms. We must be imaginative and wise in helping Russia and China become responsible world powers after tortured decades under Communism.</p>
        <p>The third millennium's economy has to be a mutually beneficial construction of expanding productivity and shared prosperity, built around the engine of trade. It is easy to see a developing nation's wealth as an opportunity for new markets. We must also perceive that a poor nation's hunger is a danger to the well-being of the whole. One of the great goals for mankind in the opening decades of the new century must be to lift hundreds of millions of destitute people from poverty.</p>
        <p>For poverty, like war, is contagious. It can destroy life, and the prospect of living as well. Deprived people must consume an earth they cannot afford to protect. They turn farmland into desert. They develop communicable diseases that can spread across continents in days.</p>
        <p>Preservation of the Planet</p>
        <p>Surely one of the modern epoch's greatest gifts to the third millennium is a new reverence for the environment. Until the most recent moment in human history, our relationship toward nature was always carelessly rapacious. But only since the Industrial Revolution have we been capable of doing irreparable damage to the land, water and air. We are the first generation to accept ecological stewardship as a duty to unborn generations.</p>
        <p>Yet we cannot ignore the fact that our desire to see poor countries reach prosperity is colliding with our need to curb fossil fuels, deforestation and the depletion of an all too exhaustible sea. Resolving those conflicts early in the new millennium may well be the test by which posterity most stringently grades us. If managed properly, capitalism, with its roots in individual self-interest, can be a powerful tool for creating the wealth that allows developing nations to cleanse the air, earth and water.</p>
        <p>Future generations will also measure what we did with the world's knowledge reserves. One of the rules for the next millennium must be that we have an obligation to disseminate, not hoard, new information about science, health and technology. The Internet has given us the tools for sharing. The will must still come from the human heart. In the end, the democratization of wealth and health depend on the worldwide democratization of knowledge.</p>
        <p>The Light of a New Day</p>
        <p>We will turn soon enough to the tasks that await us. Even now, the monumentality of this moment fades in the old familiarity of morning and afternoon. The sun has barely begun to gather itself after the winter solstice, and the light over the city and the country is so fragile that it threatens to splinter and fall in flakes to the ground, as it always threatens to do in January.</p>
        <p>And yet something about the sound of 2000 draws past and future near in a way that we have never quite known before. So here we are now, all of us, just next door to yesterday and yet somehow in a different world. This day's firstborn are already with us, and the first of us to die in this new calendar have already gone. Soon we will have slept a full night in this strange-sounding year, and then another. We cannot know how the new millennium will end, but we do have the power to determine how it begins and, perhaps, what it will remember of us.</p>
