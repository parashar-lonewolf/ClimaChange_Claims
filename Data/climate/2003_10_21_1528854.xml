        <p>Dr Eric Chivian, Center for Health and Global Environment director at Harvard Medical School, Dr Aaron S Bernstein, Harvard Center visiting researcher, and Dr Callum Roberts, University of York marine conservation biologist, write joint letter to journal Science expressing concern over possible extinction threat for cone snails; venom produced by snails contains conotoxins, which have been investigated on limited scale, but show promise in wide range of beneficial medical applications; photo (M)</p>

        <p>For centuries, cone snails have been objects of desire, their intricately patterned shells valued by collectors. More recently, the carnivorous snails have become prized for something else: their potent mix of toxins, which biomedical researchers say hold promise in drug discovery and medical treatment.</p>
        <p>But researchers are now warning that the world is in danger of loving cone snails to death. In a letter to the journal Science, three scientists say that collection practices for ornamental trade and medical research, coupled with habitat destruction through pollution and global climate change, pose an extinction threat to these animals. Without monitoring and controls on trade, they warn, many of the roughly 500 cone snail species could be lost before their value to humans is known.</p>
        <p>''We're alarmed that we may be losing the genus that has more potential medicines than any other in nature,'' said Dr. Eric Chivian, an author of the letter and director of the Center for Health and the Global Environment at Harvard Medical School.</p>
        <p>Cone snails eat other mollusks, worms and fish by injecting their prey with venom through a sharp hollow toothlike appendage. This venom is a deadly cocktail, estimated to contain 50 to 100 short chains of amino acids, or peptides, for each species. This means there are potentially as many as 50,000 of these peptides, known as conotoxins, available to medical research, Dr. Chivian said.</p>
        <p>Of these, he said, only about 100 have been investigated so far. Many are tantalizing because they have been found to bind with specific ion-channel receptors, the holes in cell membranes that allow for chemical changes to take place that can cause or halt disease. ''What these toxins do pretty much better than anything else is plug these holes with incredible specificity,'' said Dr. Aaron S. Bernstein, an author of the letter and a visiting researcher at the Harvard center.</p>
        <p>''This selectivity and sensitivity translates into an important tool for medicine,'' Dr. Bernstein said. Among other things, he said, conotoxins could form the basis for new drugs that are so receptor-specific they might avoid some side effects of other medications. A strong synthetic painkiller based on a peptide found in one species, Conus magus, is already in the late stages of clinical trials.</p>
        <p>Conotoxin research, however, requires that quantities of snails be collected from coral reefs, mangrove swamps and other shallow waters to obtain even a small sample of venom. Dr. Chivian cited a research laboratory at an American university, which he declined to name, that imported 10,000 venom glands from China for one project.</p>
        <p>But commercial collection for the ornamental trade is probably a worse problem, said Dr. Callum Roberts, a marine conservation biologist at the University of York in Britain and the third author of the letter. Collected by the millions, the shells show up in gift shops around the world, where they often sell for a few dollars each. ''The value we attach to them as ornaments is vastly lower than the value to society of their medical uses,'' Dr. Roberts said.</p>
        <p>The narrow geographic range of many of these species makes them particularly fragile. Dr. Roberts said his analysis showed that, for example, there are eight species that exist only in the Philippines. Species that are geographically limited in this way are ''more likely to go extinct through localized impacts on their environment,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Those impacts can come from environmental changes as well. Pollution and rising ocean temperatures have damaged or destroyed coral reefs around the world in recent years.</p>
        <p>Dr. Baldomero Olivera, a professor of biology at the University of Utah and a cone-snail researcher, said the environmental effects were probably more of a concern than overharvesting. In his lab, he said, he uses common snail species that are widely distributed. ''I don't think there's a great danger as far as harvesting them,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Chivian said that in studying the issue, they could find no shell-exporting nation that regulated or even monitored the trade. At the very least, he and his co-authors recommended, monitoring should occur under endangered species laws.</p>
        <p>''People have no idea what the status of these species is in the wild,'' Dr. Roberts said. ''It's not likely to be good.''</p>
