        <p>LEAD: Scientists studying the greenhouse effect are struggling to understand a host of bewildering interactions among air, water and plants that could hasten the potentially disastrous global warming, postpone its effects or, they worry, produce unexpected, rapid change in the Earth's climate.</p>
        <p>Scientists studying the greenhouse effect are struggling to understand a host of bewildering interactions among air, water and plants that could hasten the potentially disastrous global warming, postpone its effects or, they worry, produce unexpected, rapid change in the Earth's climate.</p>
        <p>The imposing challenge is to understand the multitude of possible ''feedbacks'' - changes caused by the increase in pollutants in the atmosphere that, in turn, influence the level of those pollutants or their effects on climate.</p>
        <p>The basic theory of the greenhouse effect is that a buildup of carbon dioxide, methane and other gases as a result of human activity will trap solar radiation in the atmosphere, warming the earth. But, as scientists have long known, many other things such as cloud cover and vegetation, will be changed in ways that either accelerate or moderate the warming influence of the pollutants.</p>
        <p>Now, with evidence that global warming may soon begin if it has not already, the effort to identify and understand various feedbacks is assuming a new urgency.</p>
        <p>Some of the feedbacks will clearly worsen the problem of global warming while others will ease it. For example, a higher level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will promote faster decay of vegetation, releasing carbon dioxide to the air more quickly. Yet it will also hasten plant growth that will speed the removal of carbon dioxide from the air.</p>
        <p>Scientists agree they are far from knowing even what all the possible feedbacks are, let alone the precise effects of each and their cumulative effect on the climate. But some experts fear that the overall influence of newly studied feedbacks will, over the long run, make the world even hotter than predicted by current computer models, perhaps much hotter.</p>
        <p>And, while some point to the vast uncertainties as reason to delay action in confronting the greenhouse effect, many experts argue that the possibility of accelerated damage warrants strong measures now to reduce the human impact on global systems that remain beyond scientists' understanding.</p>
        <p>Dr. Wallace S. Broecker, a professor of geochemistry at Columbia University, said information has emerged in recent years about rapid, extreme changes in world climate 10,000 to 13,000 years ago that were caused by a sudden reorganization of the ocean-atmosphere system. This, he said, ''tells us that this system is sensitive to small pushes.''</p>
        <p>The current greenhouse models, he said, are ''very conservative because they do not handle feedbacks.'' He added: ''My feeling is we overestimate our ability to predict. Many of the things that are going to happen to the planet will be surprises, like the ozone hole over Antarctica. Therefore, we should be much more careful about what we are doing and much more observant of how the system works.''</p>
        <p>Most of the climate models, which incorporate only a few of the major feedback processes, now project that average global temperatures will rise somewhere from 3 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit toward the middle of the next century. A temperature increase of that size in so short a time could substantially alter the earth's climate; cause ocean levels to rise, threatening coastal areas; disrupt crops and forests, and cause many other significant changes, scientists say. . A new study prepared by Dr. Daniel A. Lashof, an environmental scientist who works for the Environmental Protection Agency, examines a range of feedback processes that are not now included in the climate models and tries to quantify their potential effects.</p>
        <p>It concludes that they could increase the average global warming from 6.3 to 11.3 degrees Fahrenheit in the next century. ''But given the uncertainties, a range of as high as 14.4 degrees and 18 degrees cannot be ruled out,'' Dr. Lashof said in a recent interview.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lashoff said the numbers in his draft study represented educated guesses, not firm conclusions. He and other scientists said that the impacts of these potential feedbacks remain one of the most significant puzzles still surrounding the global warming issue. A Lack of Understanding</p>
        <p>''The feedback issues are very significant,'' said Dr. Roger Revelle, a professor of public policy at the University of California in San Diego, who has been studying global warming issues for many years. ''One of the principal problems with climate modeling is that we don't understand these feedbacks very well. With these biological feedbacks there is likely to be a multiplying factor in the greenhouse effect. How big I wouldn't be willing to say without further information.''</p>
        <p>But Dr. Revelle added that Dr. Lashov's estimates were ''within the realm of the possible.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Irving Mintzer, a senior scientist for the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based research and policy group, said the size and interaction of these projected feedbacks ''are an area of uncertainty but an area with important implications for policy.'' He said Dr. Lashof's paper ''is a warning that things could get worse'' than expected. ''It indicates,'' he said, ''that natural cycles could produce the kind of shocks and surprises that other scientists have only suggested. We have a system that could respond in big steps to small changes. We don't know what happens when we step across a threshold.''</p>
        <p>A feedback is a self-regulating mechanism that controls the rate or magnitude of a process. A thermostat that shuts off a furnace as the temperature rises is an example of a negative feedback that stops or slows the process of heating a house. A fireplace demonstrates a positive feedback mechanism, because when a fire is lighted, more air is drawn into the fireplace, causing the fire to burn hotter and faster and that in turn draws in still more air.</p>
        <p>Some feedback mechanisms have already been included in the computer models used to predict how temperature and climate will be affected by carbon dioxide and other pollution.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most important of these is water vapor, which traps and retains much more heat than any of the greenhouse gases. As the earth warms up because of the accumulated pollution, it is believed, the absolute humidity of the atmosphere will increase, meaning that there will be considerably more water vapor to retain heat.</p>
        <p>The models show that the impact of global warming will have two feedback effects involving ice and snow.</p>
        <p>Ice and snow tend to reflect radiation from the sun away from earth, thus reducing global temperatures. But as they melt because of the greenhouse effect, less radiation will be deflected and more will be absorbed by the dark earth and vegetation that takes its place. The melting of polar sea ice, which has an insulating effect that helps retain heat within the ocean, will release more heat into the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Clouds are considered to be the most complex feedback mechanism now included in the global climate models.</p>
        <p>Because they are largely water vapor they absorb radiation and therefore amplify the warming trend. But clouds also serve as reflective surfaces, particularly in the lower atmosphere, and so deflect solar radiation away from the earth's surface. Scientists are unsure about how these effects offset each other.</p>
        <p>But this month a paper by V. Ramanathan of the University of Chicago and his associates R. D. Cess. E. F. Harrison, P. Minnis, B. R. Barkstrom, E. Ahmad and D. Hartmann, published in the journal Science, reported that careful measurements from instruments on satellites had found that, under current conditions, the cooling effect of clouds ''dominates'' the warming effect by a substantial margin. In a telephone interview, however, Dr. Ramanathan emphasized: ''It would be a dangerous mistake to assume from our study that clouds will take care of the greenhouse effect. We still don't understand the balance and how clouds will respond to warming. That is a major uncertainty.'' Factors Missing From Models Dr. Lashof of the E.P.A. looked at a broad range of feedback mechanisms, both positive and negative, that are not now factored into the climate models widely used to predict the global warming trend, among them are these:</p>
        <p>METHANE HYDRATES. These are methane molecules that form a stable structure with water in the sediment of ocean shelves under certain temperature and pressure conditions. As the earth warms because of human activity, the temperature and pressure of the ocean will increase, with the probable effect of destabilizing and releasing the methane into the atmosphere. Because methane is a highly effective absorber of radiation, this could accentuate warming. VEGETATION GROWTH AND</p>
        <p>DECAY. Carbon dioxide in the air stimulates plant growth, so as its concentration rises the growth of vegetation will be spurred. Growing plants, in turn, absorb carbon from the air, so this will slow the global warming. But scientists increasingly believe that a warming atmosphere is also likely to speed up the process by which microganisms digest dead organic matter in the soil and release carbon dioxide into the air. Moreover, as the earth warms, it is expected that many species of trees will not be able to adjust rapidly enough to a changed climate and will die off, leaving a great mass of organic matter that will decay and release carbon dioxide. The study concludes that these varied effects will more or less cancel each other. WETLANDS AND RICE PADDIES. In these areas, where the process of decay under water takes place without oxygen, the release of methane rather than carbon dioxide will be accelerated. VEGETATION REFLECTIVITY. As the earth warms, forest growth will move toward the poles. Because dark forests are much less reflective and more absorbtive of radiation from the sun than ice, snow and open tundra, this would encourage the warming trend. OCEAN CHEMISTRY, CIRCULA=</p>
        <p>TION AND BIOLOGY. The oceans are believed to absorb about half the carbon dioxide produced by humans, and contain much more of the gas than the atmosphere does, but several effects of warming could undermine this role.</p>
        <p>But as the ocean warms, it will have a lower chemical capacity to retain carbon dioxide. Also, as the ocean warms, the vertical columns of water may become more stable, meaning that there would be less mixing of surface and deep waters, which would slow the transfer of carbon dioxide to lower depths. Phytoplankton, tiny plants in the ocean, also absorb carbon dioxide from the air. But as the atmosphere warms, the circulation and chemistry of the ocean will change in ways that could reduce the number of phytoplankton, scientists fear. ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY. Warming would accelerate chemical reactions in the lower atmosphere that cause methane and volatile organic chemicals to be oxidized, or chemically transformed. As methane is oxidized it is converted to carbon dioxide, which is a less potent greenhouse gas than methane. This would therefore reduce the warming trend.</p>
        <p>But volatile organic chemicals from the evaporation of gasoline, solvents and other sources are converted into ozone, which is a heat absorber and would amplify global warming.</p>
        <p>ELECTRICITY DEMAND. As the earth warms, people will use progressively more air-conditioning, creating more of a demand for carbon dioxide-emitting fuels that produce electricity.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lashof said that many of these various feedbacks were relatively small in comparison with the roles of clouds and water vapor. But he added, ''If the system is already sensitive to small changes, and it appears that it already is, any additional small feedbacks can have disproportionately large effects.''</p>
