        <p>In what city officials are calling the largest solar-powered project in the state's history, New Haven announced Monday that the Barnard Environmental Magnet School would get 16 percent of its electricity from the sun beginning in 2006.</p>
        <p>Mayor John DeStefano Jr. of New Haven said that the amount of solar energy generated for commercial purposes in Connecticut would double when the $34 million remodeling of the school is complete. He said it would cost $700,000 to equip the building for solar power.</p>
        <p>''We saw this as a great opportunity as we were moving toward more renewable energy sources,'' he said. ''We thought it was consistent with the city's goals to commit to 20 percent renewable energy by the year 2010. And frankly, this was the perfect building to do it in, because it's an inner-district magnet, and it's focus is on environmental science.''</p>
        <p>Rick Ross, a project director with Westmount Management, which is overseeing the solar part of the remodeling, said the school would have 269 solar panels. He said that solar power generated at the school would save the city about $309,000 in electricity costs in the first 30 years.</p>
