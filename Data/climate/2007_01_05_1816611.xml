        <p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper shuffled his cabinet in anticipation of a possible election this year. The main move was the removal of Rona Ambrose, left, as environment minister after months of condemnation. Clean air and climate change are likely to be major issues in the next national election, with the opposition Liberal Party now led by a former environment minister, Stéphane Dion. Ms. Ambrose was replaced by John Baird, who had been head of the Treasury Board. She is now intergovernmental affairs minister.</p>
