        <p>The Clinton administration's global warming report, released in draft this week, is a puzzling document.</p>
        <p>It touts assumptions far more pessimistic than those in mainstream climatology. And while presenting itself as a scientific document, it also boasts of being built on ''a national discourse'' with ''farmers, ranchers, engineers, scientists, business people, local government officials'' expressing a ''unique level of stakeholder involvement'' -- in other words, nonscientists who might have lobbying reasons for wanting to influence the report.</p>
        <p>Whether or not these flaws are politically fatal, here's the puzzling part: Despite them, the report is probably basically right.</p>
        <p>The federal assessment of global warming was ordered by Congress and elevated to urgency by the White House in 1997 around the time of the Kyoto greenhouse treaty talks. Its central prediction is that by 2100, temperatures in the United States will have risen by 5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit. This is a much bleaker estimate than that of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations affiliate under whose auspices hundreds of the world's researchers have been debating greenhouse questions since the 1980's. The panel makes a ''best estimate'' of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100; its worst-case estimate is 6 degrees.</p>
        <p>Defenders of the administration report note that it concentrates on North America and that warming effects may be especially pronounced in higher latitudes. The science on this point is shaky, a reason why the United Nations panel has avoided making temperature projections by region.</p>
        <p>The authors of the administration report relied on what was essentially a merging of two greenhouse simulation models that disagree on many points. For example, one predicts a catastrophic drought that kills off all trees of the American Southeast; the other forecasts increased rainfall and forest expansion in the Southeast. Statisticians know that merging two approximations does not produce precision; rather, it produces galimatias.</p>
        <p>Considering that many environmentalists, including Al Gore, have for years been urging Americans to believe the United Nations panel, it seems peculiar that the administration's report should diverge from it so sharply. Also open to question is the fact that the report's overview draft was been made public even though a few of the underlying studies are still not complete. It's hard not to suspect rushing for political purposes; perhaps there was a ''unique level of stakeholder involvement'' on the part of the Gore campaign.</p>
        <p>The misgivings about the administration report are unfortunate because the scientific case for an artificial greenhouse is growing ever more persuasive. Global temperatures have increased roughly 1 degree Fahrenheit in the past 100 years, and there are other, more telling climate signals: statistically significant changes in postwar rainfall patterns in North America; springs arriving one day earlier each three years; water-level cycles of the Great Lakes showing progressively earlier springs and later winters. In March, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced that global ocean temperatures are rising: because oceans cover most of Earth's surface, this may be more revealing than land temperatures.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, negotiations on the Kyoto agreement have generally been positive. President Clinton signed the Kyoto proposal in 1997 but has never submitted it for ratification because the Senate voted 95-0 not to approve any deal that failed to include the developing world. But developing nations, which initially viewed the Kyoto plan as a Western trick to slow their economies, are beginning to show support. India, for example, has reversed its position and now endorses the sort of clean-energy development that would make greenhouse reform possible.</p>
        <p>Of equal importance, the European Union nations, which initially opposed the American idea of using market-based carbon trading to reduce global warming gases, are beginning to back it. Carbon trading is favored almost unanimously by economists, many of whom project that if achieved through market mechanisms, greenhouse gas reduction will not harm world economies. David Sandalow, the assistant secretary of state who negotiated the  breakthrough with India, says, ''Many of the open issues in the Kyoto treaty are gradually being ironed out.''</p>
        <p>Greenhouse action seems increasingly important, and the chances for it seem increasingly favorable, whether under the Kyoto treaty or through some new agreement. Political overselling of the kind found in the federal global warming study isn't necessary; consensus science and economics are more than enough.</p>
