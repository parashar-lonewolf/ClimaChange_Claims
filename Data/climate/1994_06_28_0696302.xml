        <p>FOR 37 years the United States has continuously operated a scientific station at the South Pole, which has become a world center for research in astrophysics and astronomy, and for monitoring global environmental changes.</p>
        <p>But the station's dilapidated buildings and outmoded, overtaxed equipment may soon begin to hobble polar research. Officials of the National Science Foundation reported at a meeting last week that research at South Pole Station, one of three year-around stations operated by the United States on the Antarctic continent, might have to be curtailed or even ended if funds cannot be found to restore the aging base.</p>
        <p>The foundation says it needs $200 million, of which $35 million would be spent in the first year of the eight-year project, to replace the station with a new one better equipped to withstand the brutal polar environment. Even under the best conditions, the bleak, featureless South Polar desert -- the coldest and driest place on earth -- isolates station crews from the outer world for nine months at a stretch, and exposes them to cramped quarters, continuous outside darkness and temperatures that dip below minus 120 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
        <p>A panel of prominent scientists convened here to listen to the troubles of foundation officials and scientists who are trying to maintain the South Pole Station's research programs in the face of mounting difficulties. The panel will make its recommendations before a meeting in August of the National Science Board, which will advise the White House on a course of action.</p>
        <p>Pressing problems include a recent structural failure in the station's main building, a geodesic dome, as well as the lack of a proper garage for vital snow-plowing machinery and a dangerous fuel storage system, which consists of big rubber fuel bladders on the snow that pose a constant threat of an oil spill or fire. Other major problems include an overloaded waste system that has been pumping raw sewage into the icecap for four decades, and conditions that lead to psychological stress and "cabin fever."</p>
        <p>A detailed plan developed by the foundation and a team of architects, engineers and other experts, calls for completion of a new South Pole Station by the year 2003, if funds permit.</p>
        <p>Joseph Ferraro of the architectural firm of Ferraro/Choi and Associates said the station would be replaced a little at a time to reduce costs and to avoid interrupting research. Problem of Drifting Snow</p>
        <p>One of the main problems with the station, which was completed in 1975, is drifting snow. Blown by the winds on the polar plateau, drifting snow builds up against the lee side of structures. Because it never melts, it builds up year after year, and may finally crush the adjacent structure. This has begun to happen to the 52-foot-high aluminum dome that has sheltered the cluster of buildings serving as the nerve center of South Pole Station since 1974. The enormous weight of snow on the dome's lee side has deformed the building's support structure and will eventually wreck it, engineers believe.</p>
        <p>The dome, which for two decades has symbolized America's presence at the pole, would be dismantled and shipped, piece by piece, to the United States for disposal. In its place would rise a string of horseshoe-shaped modular buildings connected by passageways and built on stilts to permit blowing snow to pass through without forming drifts. As the stilts slowly sink into the two-and-a-half mile-thick icecap, they would be jacked up.</p>
        <p>For the first time, Mr. Ferraro said, each inhabitant of the station would have a private berthing cubicle. Also for the first time, most rooms would have windows; the canvas Jamesway huts and converted meat lockers where people now live were built without windows to conserve heat.</p>
        <p>Among the innovations of the new station would be a system to recycle liquid waste. Untreated sewage would no longer be pumped into the ice, where it has been accumulating several hundred feet down for nearly four decades. Water from showers and wash basins in the new station would be recycled for use in flushing toilets, and the effluents from toilets would be treated and possibly used to irrigate an indoor vegetable garden. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration intends to use the South Pole program, called a Controlled Ecological Life Support System, as a test bed for similar systems that might be used in space stations.</p>
        <p>Solar heat collectors recently installed on the walls of a new building at the pole have already sharply reduced heating fuel use in the polar summer, and the new station would make even more extensive use of solar power.</p>
        <p>Dr. Cornelius Sullivan, director of the foundation's Office of Polar Programs, acknowledged that Federal money for major science projects was very scarce and that the station would have to do the best it could with whatever support it could get.</p>
        <p>The science foundation, which carries most of the financial load for America's Antarctic program, is also the main Federal agency for financing scientific research in the United States, and its $2 billion budget supports projects in virtually every field of research. Several panelists considering the future of the polar station, including Dr. Charles H. Townes, winner of a 1964 Nobel Prize in Physics for the invention of the maser, a device that led to the invention of the laser, said they were uneasy about the possibility that financing in other scientific fields supported by the foundation would have to be reduced to pay for a new polar station. Possibility of Shutdown</p>
        <p>To avoid that possibility, Dr. Sullivan said, his agency hopes for a special Congressional authorization to renovate the station that would not be included in the foundation's main budget.</p>
        <p>Dr. Neal Lane, director of the National Science Foundation, said his organization would do its best to keep the station functioning as effectively as possible, at whatever level of financing Congress endorsed. "But we cannot rule out the possibility of having to close the station somewhere down the line," he said, if financing falls below some threshold.</p>
        <p>The closing of the station would mean the end of any year-around human presence on the Polar Plateau, a region of the Antarctic continent roughly the size of the United States, which contains 90 percent of the world's ice. Two permanent stations would continue to be maintained elsewhere on the continent: McMurdo Station on the Ross Sea, and Palmer Station on the Antarctic Peninsula.</p>
        <p>The only other permanent scientific research station on the Polar Plateau had been Russia's Vostok Station, some 800 miles from the pole. But last year, lack of financial support from Moscow forced Russia to close the Vostok Station, at least temporarily.</p>
        <p>Prospects for reopening Vostok seem dim, even though a major international ice-coring project at Vostok has produced vital information about the earth's climate during the past few thousand years. One problem is that Russia no longer considers its Antarctic bases politically important, and as a result Moscow's financial support has largely collapsed.</p>
        <p>In recent years, scientists have discovered many new reasons for focusing their efforts on the South Pole, including monitoring the dangerous hole that has developed in the earth's protective ozone shield and measuring the global effects of carbon dioxide and other trace gases poured into the air by human activity.</p>
        <p>One reason for the popularity of the South Pole as a research site is that the earth's magnetic field lines converge near the pole, funneling streams of cosmic-ray particles to detectors on the ground. These particles help to reveal details of how the earth's magnetic field interacts with the solar wind.</p>
        <p>Sensitive seismometers at the South Pole record vital data not only from earthquakes throughout the world, but can also detect nuclear explosions. The station's seismometers play an important role in monitoring compliance with the nuclear test-ban treaty.</p>
        <p>The fastest growing branch of research at the South Pole is astrophysics. Investigation of the cosmic microwave background (a telltale relic of the creation of the universe in the Big Bang 15 billion years ago) and the detection of neutrino particles reaching Earth from distant galaxies are two of the sciences for which the pole has been recognized as an ideal laboratory.</p>
        <p>Another advantage of Antarctica is its long dark winter, during which astronomical telescopes can continuously observe objects that change in brightness or spectral quality over periods of minutes or hours. From an observatory at a higher latitude, observations of this kind must be interrupted during the day. Similarly, the continuous daylight of the polar summer permits continuous observation of the rapid and complex oscillations of the Sun, leading to a better understanding of its energy engine.</p>
        <p>A unique feature of Antarctica is its vast, thick ice sheet, which is now being used to measure the fleeting passages of neutrino particles that arrive from the depths of space and pass through Earth, emerging in Antarctica. These particles offer clues to the nature of galactic cores, stellar collapse and supernovas.</p>
        <p>But the growing numbers of men and women who conduct research at the pole are packed like sardines into their cramped cubicles, huts and tents. Erick Chiang, operations manager for America's Antarctic programs, said the population of the South Pole Station, which for many years was limited to 36 in summertime and 18 during the long, dark winter, is now approaching 135 in summer and 30 in winter.</p>
        <p>Far more scientists would like to work at the South Pole than the station can accommodate, and the prospect of reducing their numbers even further appalls them.</p>
        <p>"South Pole Station is almost like a geosynchronous satellite for studying upper atmosphere physics," said Dr. Theodore Rosenberg, an atmospheric physicist at the University of Maryland. "It would be a major blow to science if the station were to disappear."</p>
