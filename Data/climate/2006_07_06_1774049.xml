        <p>Fun in the sun is all good -- until somebody gets burned. To keep track of how many rays you're getting while enjoying the weather, there's Oregon Scientific's Personal UV Monitor, which includes an exposure timer to help you get back in the shade before it's too late.</p>
        <p>The potential exposure to harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation varies with seasons, weather conditions and the state of the ozone layer. (Spending time in the sun on days with a high UV index can lead to skin damage from the sun more quickly than on days with a lower UV index.) The Personal UV Monitor keeps track of the current UV levels as well as the temperature, and calculates a recommended exposure time based on your skin type and the sun protection factor of any sunscreen lotion used.</p>
