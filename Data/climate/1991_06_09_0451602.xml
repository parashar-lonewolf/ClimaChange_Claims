        <p>Saddam Hussein's decision to torch more than 600 oil wells in Kuwait, an act of insane vindictiveness, may yield his grimmest legacy.</p>
        <p>A photographic essay in today's New York Times Magazine vividly portrays the appalling mess: oil-soaked workers toiling in 12-hour shifts, struggling with hand tools to stanch the burning flow. What the pictures cannot convey are the costs of Saddam Hussein's inferno.</p>
        <p>The fires are consuming five million barrels a day, three times Kuwait's prewar production. The lost oil is worth more than $90 million a day. Oil covers thousands of acres, killing plant life and threatening subsurface water. Smoke turns day to night. Hospitals report a dramatic increase in respiratory cases. Anti-pollution masks sell briskly for $30 in supermarkets.</p>
        <p>Fears that the fires would cause either a sharp increase in global temperatures or a worldwide cooling under vast soot clouds have subsided. Yet local and regional dangers remain.</p>
        <p>The greatest threat is a temperature inversion that would keep the fumes at ground level, forcing many people to breathe in toxic gases. Normally, the relentless Kuwaiti sun bakes the desert floor, creating thermals of rising air. The fear is that dense smoke will now block the sun's rays, dampen the thermals and trap dirty air close to the ground.</p>
        <p>The mist of oil also threatens to contaminate the Persian Gulf and the phytoplankton that nourish the region's fish. Some scientists even speculate that the hot fires will interfere with regional weather patterns and disrupt or deflect the July-August monsoons on which the nations of the Indian Ocean depend for water and food.</p>
        <p>The carbon dioxide released by the fire may not rise high enough to worsen the feared warming of the earth's atmosphere. Even at their worst, the fires added only 3 percent to the carbon pumped into the atmosphere every day by cars and industrial processes. And they generate less than one-sixth of the greenhouse gases released by reckless deforestation.</p>
        <p>Scientists and politicians are finally mobilizing. A team financed partly by the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy is on the scene to study consequences and suggest remedies. And the Bush Administration shed its indifference by sending William Reilly, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, to Kuwait.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly, astounded by the devastation, reported one piece of good news last week: the capping of 136 fires. At that rate, the fires could be gone in another year -- sooner than first thought.</p>
        <p>Scientists have suggested a new protocol to the Geneva Conventions outlawing environmental terrorism as an instrument of warfare. However, Protocol I of the 1949 Geneva Conventions tried to do just that, and nobody has paid attention. As Jessica Matthews of the World Resources Institute points out, "War is usually terrible for the environment."</p>
        <p>At the very least, calculations of environmental risk belong in future military planning and public debate preceding any decision to go to war. In the meantime, a more vigorous effort is needed to alleviate the human suffering caused by Saddam Hussein's wanton destruction.</p>
