        <p>LEAD: WITH the help of new technology, scientists are gathering clues from tar-pit fossils that may explain why most of America's large animal species died out 11,000 years ago.</p>
        <p>WITH the help of new technology, scientists are gathering clues from tar-pit fossils that may explain why most of America's large animal species died out 11,000 years ago.</p>
        <p>Paleontologists at the George C. Page Museum, situated among the Rancho La Brea tar pits of west Los Angeles, believe that new evidence is moving them closer to solution of the riddle.</p>
        <p>Some experts contend that the mass extinctions at the end of the Pleistocene epoch were caused by human hunters newly arrived in America from Asia. But scientists at the Page Museum say evidence is mounting that the main killer was an abrupt change in climate.</p>
        <p>Only in the past few years have modern investigative methods begun to reap subtle clues documenting changes in climate and habitat that may have led to the Pleistocene extinctions. While scientists of earlier generations were interested chiefly in the bones of large mammals, today's tar-pit investigators have begun to focus on fossil pollen, microscopic mollusks and other organisms that illuminate changes in habitat and climate.</p>
        <p>Among other things, scientists examining the fossilized teeth of some animals from the tar pits have determined that they subsisted on plants that grow in relatively dry climates. The finding supports the contention that as the last ice age ended, the region's climate became much drier, upsetting the ecological balance that allowed the large mammals to thrive.</p>
        <p>Since 1901 paleontologists have recognized the pits at Rancho La Brea - Spanish for Tar Ranch - as the world's richest source of fossils from the late Pleistocene and early Holocene epochs, running from 35,000 to 10,000 years ago. The 100 tons of fossils recovered over the years from the sticky black deposits have yielded more than 570 species of animals and plants, including the remains of 4,000 large carnivores, among them saber-toothed tigers, American lions and dire wolves.</p>
        <p>Skeletons of imperial mammoths, giant bears and other animals dug from the pits adorn museum collections around the world. Excavation continues every summer, moreover, and extensive fossil deposits remain to be mined.</p>
        <p>During the months of July and August when the sun warms the asphalt and dries up overlying pools of water, museum excavators and volunteers descend into Pit 91. Standing on squares of plywood, they use trowels to carefully dislodge blocks of tar to add to the museum's trove.</p>
        <p>''Dissecting the tar blocks is very slow work and we have years of backlog to get through,'' said Shelley M. Cox, the museum's laboratory manager. After large bones have been charted and removed, the tar must be dissolved in trichlorethylene and sifted for fragments of animals and plants.</p>
        <p>Among the instruments scientists at the Page Museum have brought to bear on this work is a computer mapping system, in which a pointer emitting a high-frequency sound is used to record the exact positions of fossil bones before they are removed. The system, its users say, permits scientists to reconstruct an image of a complete section of fossils and to draw inferences about the manner and chronology of death from the placement of the bones.</p>
        <p>To mark the position of one end of a femur, for instance, the researcher touches it with the pointer. Sound from the pointer travels to four overhead microphones mounted in a rigid frame. The computer controlling the apparatus measures and records the length of time sound takes to travel from the pointer to each of the four microphones. By comparing these times, the computer calculates the three-dimensional position of the spot on the bone, correct to within half a millimeter. Interrelated Fossils</p>
        <p>George T. Jefferson, curator of the Page Museum, said that such reconstruction was especially useful in cases where separate fossils were interrelated in some way.</p>
        <p>''For example,'' he said, ''we came upon the skeleton of a saber-tooth tiger lying face down on the skeleton of a dire wolf, which was lying face up. A computer record of the positions of their respective bones will help us reconstruct how that little drama unfolded.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jefferson believes that major discoveries at the tar pits have yet to be made. Some will come from future excavations, he said, while others will result from re-examination of fossils stored in the museum's enormous vaults.</p>
        <p>''Nearly every week we're turning up surprises,'' he said. ''Last month, while examining fossil material that had been excavated here between 1905 and 1915, we discovered a fang and bones of a Homotherium, a rare genus of saber-tooth tiger previously unknown west of the Rocky Mountains, that had been overlooked by earlier investigators.''</p>
        <p>The common smilodon saber-toothed tiger, which was roughly the size of a modern African lion, had legs of equal length. The Homotherium, somewhat larger than the smilodon, had longer front legs than hind legs, and its six-inch fangs had especially well marked serrations along their front and rear edges.</p>
        <p>Another recent surprise, Mr. Jefferson said, was the discovery of fossilized snails of a type that survives today only in the cool, moist highlands of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
        <p>''That discovery tells us something important about changes in climate,'' Mr. Jefferson said. ''For these snails to have survived in southern California during Pleistocene times, there must have been twice as much precipitation here as there is now. On the other hand, we know from the pattern of fossil plants we find in the tar that the precipitation could not have been in the form of rain. It must therefore have been early-morning fog condensation of the kind you see in the uplands today.'' Food in the Teeth</p>
        <p>Mr. Jefferson and colleagues at other institutions turned up a significant clue about the late-Pleistocene habitat from the teeth of an extinct species of bison. Food stuck in the animals' teeth had been preserved by the tar.</p>
        <p>''Contrary to traditional assumptions,'' Mr. Jefferson said, ''we found that extinct bisons and camels in the Rancho La Brea area apparently got along with little or no grass in their diets. They ate barberry shrubs, legume seed pods and other things.'' The latter foods, which are nutritionally poorer than grass, can grow in relatively dry climates.</p>
        <p>The microscopic inspection of bison teeth for fragments of food has so far revealed nine genuses of plants previously unknown in the La Brea deposits.</p>
        <p>The reconstruction of southern California's climate during the period from 35,000 to 10,000 years ago is pivotal to the scientific debate over the Pleistocene extinctions that occurred throughout North America.</p>
        <p>Some scientists, notably Prof. Paul S. Martin of the University of Arizona, believe that human hunters killed off the elephant-like mammoths and mastodons, ancient bison, ancient horses, camels, giant ground sloths, giant beavers and other large mammals that once roamed America in vast numbers. These animals disappeared from the fossil record not long after humans are believed to have arrived in America about 13,000 years ago. Timing 'Too Striking to Ignore'</p>
        <p>''The coincidence in time between the arrival of human beings and the demise of all those animal species is too striking to ignore,'' Dr. Martin said in a telephone interview. ''Obviously, a change in climate created the conditions for the human migration to America from Asia. But I believe the holocaust that destroyed 70 percent of the large animal species in America in a very short time was the work of man.''</p>
        <p>But other scientists contend that as continental glaciers receded when the last ice age ended, abrupt changes in climate upset the delicately balanced ecological conditions upon which many large mammals depended. The climate of much of America became markedly drier, with wider and more prolonged swings between extremes of temperature. This, Dr. Jefferson and his colleagues contend, was the primary reason for the Pleistocene extinctions.</p>
        <p>Still other experts believe that both climate change and human predation played roles in the extinctions.</p>
        <p>The tar pits here were created by the sliding-together of the Pacific and North American plates in the earth's crust, which caused a fault line extending along Sixth Street in modern Los Angeles. Propelled by subterranean pockets of methane gas, asphalt has been oozing up through this fault system for the past 35,000 years, forming pools that trap unwary creatures more efficiently than fly paper. With the continued flow of tar, carcasses are eventually covered over and preserved, and the process continues to this day.  Extinct mammals trapped in tar include giant ground sloths; one is shown being threatened by three dire wolves and a homotherium, a kind of saber-toothed tiger. In the background, Clovis Indians hunt imperial mammoths. Some say hunters killed off mammals; others cite climate.  Mapping Fossils at the Page Museum  A stylus touching a bone emits high-frequency sounds. A computer records how long it takes for the sounds to reach each of four overhead microphones and determines the bone's exact position.  A fossilized snail, Pupilla hebes, above is found in the tar pits along with larger mammals but survives today only in the cool, moist highlands of the Pacific Northwest. Some say this is evidence that a sudden climate change caused the extinction of large mammals.  'Before I Knew It, I Was Mired'</p>
        <p>Pigeons, squirrels and other animals continue to become mired in the Rancho La Brea tar pits in Los Angeles, and despite the chain-link fences around them, people occasionally get stuck, too.</p>
        <p>Eric Scott, the chief excavator of the George C. Page Museum, climbed over one of the fences last summer to retrieve a traffic marker someone had thrown over. ''The asphalt looked crusted and hard, but before I knew it, I was mired,'' he said. ''The tar was soon up to my ankles and I was calling for help.''</p>
        <p>Visitors to Hancock Park watched him from outside the fence for a while without intervening, he said, adding, ''I heard one father explaining calmly to his kid that a man was stuck in the tar and was going down, just like one of the old mammoths.''</p>
