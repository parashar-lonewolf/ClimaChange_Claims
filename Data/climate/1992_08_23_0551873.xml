        <p>Fresh from a Republican National Convention that they celebrated as a triumph for their cause, the preachers and ideological spokesmen of the religious right gathered here this weekend to anoint President Bush as their champion in a battle between good and evil.</p>
        <p>At a two-day meeting, the Rev. Jerry Falwell, Phyllis Schlafly, Oliver L. North, Patrick J. Buchanan and others replayed many themes heard at the Houston convention, but in harsher terms.</p>
        <p>With no national television audience looking on, speakers denounced Gov. Bill Clinton as a friend of pornographers, asserted that the ozone hole was an atheist ploy and warned that the Democrats would let militant homosexuals take over the armed forces.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush is to accept the gathering's accolades tonight night when he appears on a stage crowded with leaders of the Christian evangelical movement, including some who have never before delved so directly into electoral politics. Organizers said Mr. Clinton declined invitations to attend. Sense of Urgency</p>
        <p>Although the event is billed as a nonpartisan "National Affairs Briefing" to instruct conservative preachers on political issues, one speaker after another urged the crowd not only to vote for the Republican ticket but also to organize their congregations and communities on Mr. Bush's behalf. The slogan, "a defining moment in America's history," printed on huge banners, conveyed the sense of urgency that has filled the Dallas Convention Center since Friday afternoon.</p>
        <p>This is the second such briefing organized by a coalition of religious and conservative organizations, and the distance between the two events marks an era in American political history.</p>
        <p>The first was held almost 12 years ago after the 1980 Republican convention, and it was addressed by Ronald Reagan who enthusiastically endorsed the then-nascent effort to make conservative Christians a political force.</p>
        <p>The 1980 meeting helped cement an alliance between the Republican Party and organizations like Mr. Falwell's Moral Majority. That year they worked together to deny Jimmy Carter the votes of his fellow Southern Baptists and in two subsequent elections the religious right was among the most active elements in the coalition that has kept Republicans in the White House.</p>
        <p>But in recent years, some prominent ministries suffered sexual or financial scandals. And the evangelicals' boldest move into electoral politics, the Rev. Pat Robertson's 1988 Presidential campaign, flopped.</p>
        <p>Mr. Falwell, who disbanded the Moral Majority in 1989 and has spent much of the past two years rescheduling the huge debts incurred by his Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., said, "There is no central organization any more, and the religious right doesn't need one now because the hard work of voter registration, of getting people to participate in politics, that has been accomplished."</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush, often perceived as a patrician Yankee with moderate views, has never been of favorite of this constituency, which finds its roots in the rural South, and at this meeting, when he was personally praised, it was mostly as an heir to the Reagan legacy. What remains to be seen is whether the rank and file will mobilize against a Democratic ticket of two Baptist Southerners who spice their speeches with scriptural quotations.</p>
        <p>Many of the speakers who came here directly from Houston told the audience that they had seen proof of Mr. Bush's ideological good intentions in the convention's strong stand against abortion, Mr. Buchanan's and Mr. Reagan's prominence on the stage and the unrelenting emphasis on family values.</p>
        <p>Mr. Falwell said flatly, "I think it is the best convention the Republicans have had in my recollection."</p>
        <p>Mrs. Schlafly, chairman of the Republican National Coalition for Life, said in a speech that preventing "wimpy politicians" from diluting the party's platform plank on abortion was "one of the cleanest, clearest victories we have had" and she added later, "Bush needs that as a kind of backbone." More Prominent Figures</p>
        <p>Before Mr. Bush's speech, Dr. Joel Gregory is scheduled to say a prayer and Dr. W. A. Criswell is scheduled to offer welcome. Both men are leaders of the First Baptist Church of Dallas, which claims to be the largest Baptist congregation in the country. And Mr. Bush is to be introduced by Dr. Adrian Rogers, a three-time president of the Southern Baptist Convention, the nation's largest Protestant denomination.</p>
        <p>"In 1980 I would never have even asked someone like Adrian Rogers to this kind of event and that shows how natural it's become for our leaders to get involved in political affairs," said the chief organizer of both the 1980 and 1992 briefings, Ed McAteer of Memphis, the president of the Religious Roundtable, a nondenominational group active in the politics of the religious right.</p>
        <p>Mr. McAteer said that he had invited Mr. Clinton to attend the event but that campaign officials had declined. "I promised him a fair chance to say what he wanted to say, but I guess he could figure that some people here were going to be pretty critical of him," Mr. McAteer said.</p>
        <p>In advance of Mr. Bush's arrival, Mr. Clinton was repeatedly subjected to personal and political attacks even more vituperative than those aimed at him during the Republican convention.</p>
        <p>For example, the Rev. Donald F. Wildmon, president of the American Family Association, said, "If Bill Clinton goes to the White House, he'll take his friends the homosexuals, the abortionists and the pornographers."</p>
        <p>Daniel O. Graham, a retired Army general and former adviser to Mr. Reagan, said "atheists and agnostics and their trained-seal scientists" invented environmental threats like the greenhouse effect and the ozone hole to promote their dream of "world government." He said Senator Al Gore was one of the chief proponents of the view that "you are supposed to shell out your money and give up your nationhood to prevent these nonexistent dangers." Buchanan Makes It Personal</p>
        <p>Gene Antonio, a Dallas-based speaker who specializes in anti-homosexual remarks, said that new scientific evidence shows that the virus that causes AIDS can be transmitted through breathing because it infects saliva, a view roundly disputed by medical experts. The Democratic convention, he said, "was a sea of homosexuals and lesbians and this is the White House we will be facing in a few months if we do not put in a lot of shoe leather."</p>
        <p>But it was Mr. Buchanan, in a speech Friday night, who most forcefully posed a Democratic victory as a personal threat to the audience here.</p>
        <p>Speaking of the rioting in Los Angeles last spring, he warned that "barbarians" are taking over American cities. "Where did that mob come from?" he asked. "It came out of public schools where God and the Ten Commandments and the Bible were long ago expelled." And, like many of the speakers, he blamed the Democrats in Congress for thwarting Mr. Reagan's efforts to restore prayer in the public schools.</p>
        <p>In urging the religious right to join "the battle over America's soul," he said, "the purpose of the adversary culture is to separate parents from their children." And, if the battle is lost, he warned, "our grandchildren may resemble us physically, but they will be as different from us as night and day."</p>
