        <p>LEAD: Acid rain is reported by scientific observers to have turned the top of Camel's Hump, this state's highest mountain, into a ''moonscape.'' On a recent fishing trip to heavily forested Quebec, even an unscientific observer saw enough blighted trees to raise the hackles on his neck.</p>
        <p>Acid rain is reported by scientific observers to have turned the top of Camel's Hump, this state's highest mountain, into a ''moonscape.'' On a recent fishing trip to heavily forested Quebec, even an unscientific observer saw enough blighted trees to raise the hackles on his neck.</p>
        <p>Polluted air did not cause all the damage, and certainly not a disappointing catch; cold, rainy weather was mostly responsible for the latter. It was nevertheless consoling to emerge from the woods and find that President Bush had made an important and innovative proposal that, if pressed, could eliminate the virulent effects of acid rain by about the end of the century.</p>
        <p>After eight years of do-nothing Reaganism, and Mr. Bush's indecision in most other areas, that's something to cheer about. In the first place, he demanded a greater reduction of sulfur dioxide emissions - 10 million tons, about half the total, over 10 years - than had been expected, or than industry and his budgetary advisers wanted. Two million tons of oxides of nitrogen emissions would be eliminated in the same decade.</p>
        <p>In the second place, Mr. Bush adopted a scheme devised by the Environmental Defense Fund that will cut the cost of the reductions, permit the industries affected greater flexibility in meeting the requirements, and adapt market principles to good public policy. Had it not been for these innovations, it's reported, the Office of Management and Budget would have rejected the vital 10-million-ton goal as too costly.</p>
        <p>The Bush plan, owing to these features, will be far cheaper than one proposed last year by Senators George Mitchell of Maine and Robert Byrd of West Virginia, the new and the old Democratic majority leaders. They would have forced polluting utility plants to install expensive ''scrubbers'' to cut harmful emissions; the costs surely would have been passed to the ratepayers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush would allow these plants - 107 of them, in 18 states - to install scrubbers, switch to lower-sulfur coal, adopt suitable new technologies, encourage consumers to cut back on use of electricity, or employ any combination of these ideas. The costs to some of these utilities could be cut, moreover, by allowing them to sell so-called ''pollution rights.''</p>
        <p>The term is somewhat misleading but likely to stick. If one plant cut its emissions of pollutants more than required, it could sell the overage to another plant; the buying plant then could subtract that amount of emissions from the reduction it otherwise would be required to achieve. The total reduction required by the Bush plan would remain the same, but the selling plant could reduce its costs by the amount obtained from a buyer; and the buyer also might save money by having to reach a lower reduction goal.</p>
        <p>This is not exactly a ''pollution right'' or a ''license to pollute'' because the required total reduction of emissions still would be achieved. The burden of achieving the total, however, could be shifted, for a fee, among the polluting utilities; and their political resistance to reducing emissions might be substantially lessened by the flexibility and the cost-recovery possibilities allowed by Mr. Bush's proposals. Increased rates to consumers still are inevitable; but they should be less than if all polluters were required to install scrubbers.</p>
        <p>Stiff opposition is to be expected, certainly from states producing high-sulfur coal. Their representatives, like Mr. Byrd, will push for required scrubbers, in order to avoid a wholesale shift to low-sulfur coal - an option offered by the President that many plants are likely to take up. Some consumer and environmental groups and others critical of business may fight the idea that ''a license to pollute'' can be purchased.</p>
        <p>Legislation to codify Mr. Bush's proposals, not yet written, also will need to foreclose at least two critical loopholes:</p>
        <p>* Constant monitoring of smokestack emissions from all 107 of the affected utilities will be required to see that the reduction goals are being met, and to maintain public confidence - particularly in the ''pollution rights'' plan.</p>
        <p>* As demand for electricity grows and new utility plants come on line in the future, their emissions will have to be controlled and factored into the permitted total.</p>
        <p>No doubt there will be other objections, some legitimate; but it's long past time to update a Clean Air Act that hasn't been changed since 1977. Mr. Bush's acid-rain and other clean-air proposals give Congress a real incentive to get on with the job.</p>
