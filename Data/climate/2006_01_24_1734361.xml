        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Thomas L. Friedman is wasting his time, pitching science and technology to the current president. Pushing energy efficiency to someone who doesn't believe in planning (exemplified by Iraq), or even the reliability of data (say, predicting an end to fossil fuels), is talking to a wall. In fact, President Bush has preserved the ''American way of life'' he favors -- importing tax policy from Ronald Reagan, energy policy from Dwight D. Eisenhower, foreign policy from Teddy Roosevelt and science policy from William Jennings Bryan.</p>

        <p>For all of Mr. Friedman's sensible ideas depend on believing that the future matters, even favoring it when planning a nation's destiny. That differs markedly from Mr. Bush and his faith-based supporters, who look for the salvation of a Christian nation in a future dominated by divine rapture, not science or technology. After all, doesn't the permanence of heaven trump the transience of a Sputnik or two?</p>
