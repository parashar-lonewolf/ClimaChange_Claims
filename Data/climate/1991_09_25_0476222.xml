        <p>With all due sarcasm derived from living under a Kennedy Airport flight path, Joan Artusa said, "Oh, terrific!" when told yesterday that the Federal Aviation Administration had eased its plan to phase out the nation's noisiest airplanes.</p>

        <p>With all due sarcasm derived from living under a Kennedy Airport flight path, Joan Artusa said, "Oh, terrific!" when told yesterday that the Federal Aviation Administration had eased its plan to phase out the nation's noisiest airplanes.</p>
        <p>"They fly very low," said Mrs. Artusa, who lives on Randall Avenue in Lawrence, L.I. "Why are they doing this? Don't they consider the people?"</p>
        <p>The decision will reverberate, for years to come, from the Five Towns of Nassau County, along the Rockaways, to neighborhoods like Astoria and Woodside near La Guardia Airport in Queens and through places like Newark and Elizabeth that surround Newark International Airport.</p>
        <p>"These people are not going to be happy," said David Levy, a Hempstead Town councilman who is also vice chairman of the Town-Village Aircraft Safety and Noise Abatement Committee. "They were given a timetable, and to varying degrees they've accepted that. Now you're telling them that relief may be two years further down the road."</p>
        <p>"There are times during the day when you can't hear yourself think," Mr. Levy continued, "and times overnight when getting peaceful sleep is out of the question." 'It Drives You Nuts'</p>
        <p>Assemblyman Maurice D. Hinchey is incensed. "If you live near an airport, it drives you nuts," he said.</p>
        <p>As chairman of the Assembly Committee on Environmental Conservation, Mr. Hinchey, a Democrat from Saugerties, is co-sponsor of legislation that would phase out all of the noisiest jets from New York airports by 1996. A similar bill is pending in New Jersey. But the Federal Government has declared its intention to oppose such legislation in court.</p>
        <p>"This is the same kind of approach that the Bush Administration is taking concerning national carbon dioxide emissions," Mr. Hinchey said. "Once again, the people lose."</p>
        <p>The chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Richard C. Leone, said he had not yet learned details of the agency's plan. "We understand there is still some room for local options," he said.</p>
        <p>Richard Roper, chairman of the Port Authority's Newark International Airport Aviation Advisory Committee, said he, too, wanted to study the plan. But, he said, "I don't think many residents will be happy."</p>
