        <p>Although aerosol inflaters are helpful for quickly repairing flat tires, many brands contain gases that are flammable or can damage the earth's ozone layer.</p>
        <p>An inflater contains a puncture-sealing latex or rubber resin, to seal a puncture, and compressed gas, which starts to inflate the tire. Once the car is in motion again, heat generated by the friction of the tire's rotation causes the gas to expand and further inflate the tire.

        <p>Although aerosol inflaters are helpful for quickly repairing flat tires, many brands contain gases that are flammable or can damage the earth's ozone layer.</p>
        <p>An inflater contains a puncture-sealing latex or rubber resin, to seal a puncture, and compressed gas, which starts to inflate the tire. Once the car is in motion again, heat generated by the friction of the tire's rotation causes the gas to expand and further inflate the tire. The repair is only temporary; the driver should take the car to the nearest gas station.</p>
        <p>Most aerosol inflaters contain propane, butane and isobutane, which are flammable gases. These inflaters usually have labels reading "Danger: Extremely Flammable." But last year one brand advertised as nonflammable produced flames in five of seven tests conducted by Consumers Union for its magazine, Consumer Reports.</p>
        <p>Although aerosol canisters carry warning labels, the person most endangered, the mechanic who repairs the tire, may not know the gas is in it. The the danger comes when the tire is deflated for a permanent repair. Some flammable inflaters come with peel-off warning stickers to place on the tire to alert the mechanic. But they may not stick well if the tire is greasy or wet, said Wade Hoyt, editor of Motor Magazine, a trade publication based in Garden City, L.I.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hoyt wrote an article for the magazine on aerosol tire inflaters after reading about a mechanic who had been seriously hurt while trying to repair a tire filled with flammable gases. The mechanic was inflating the tire before he would insert a plug in the break, and his metal tire-rasp came in contact with the tire's steel belt, generating a spark that ignited the gas.</p>
        <p>Nonflammable inflaters are available, but many contain chlorofluorocarbon, which is being phased out because it can harm the ozone layer, violating the Clean Air Act of 1990.</p>
        <p>Nationwide Industries, in Durham, N.C., uses hydrochlorofluorocarbon-22, or HCFC-22, in its Snap Fix A Flat brand. HCFC-22 is nonflammable and does only a fraction of the much damage to the ozone layer as chlorofluorocarbons do, said Reva Rebenstein, a science adviser for the Federal Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>Bob Savasta, senior technical editor of Motor Magazine, said that even though there had been no reports of canisters exploding in cars' trunks in hot weather, there was a potential for disaster since the gases are flammable. Before mechanics repair any tire, Mr. Hoyt said, they should ask the customer if aerosol inflaters have been used on it. The tire should be deflated outdoors, Mr. Hoyt said, before it is taken into the shop for repairs.</p>
        <p>He also said drivers and mechanics should not repair a tire with a plug because the tire-rasp, the mechanic's probing tool, may strike a spark. He suggested simply patching the tire from the inside.</p>
