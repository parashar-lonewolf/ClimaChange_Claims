        <p>CONSUMERS respond listlessly to much of their marketing and research. Revenues are tumbling. Energetic competitors are making inroads into the core customer base. In Washington, credibility and clout are at a low point.</p>
        <p>An assessment of a flagging industrial corporation? Hardly. Rather it is a summary of the dismal performance that made 1994 the most troubling year ever for many of the nation's largest environmental organizations.</p>
        <p>What happened? As the year ended the national media took a crack at the question. "Past its prime," USA Today said of the national environmental movement. "Groping for a vision," added The Los Angeles Times. The Nation, in perhaps the harshest critique, accused the movement's senior executives of being "elitist, highly paid, detached from the people, indifferent to the working class and a firm ally of big Government."</p>
        <p>Time for a shakeout? Though painful for those executives and staff members involved, it probably would not be such a bad thing for American environmentalism. At least that is the conclusion reached by the Center for the Study of American Business, an economic research group affiliated with Washington University in St. Louis.</p>
        <p>In a report published last month, "Restructuring Environmental Big Business," the center said the turmoil in the national environmental groups had largely been caused by their own mismanagement. During the 1980's, when times were good, the groups lost focus and direction in a headlong drive for growth, only to suffer later. In short, the report concludes, the environmental groups made the same mistakes that many American corporations made during the 1980's.</p>
        <p>"By significantly expanding the scale and scope of their groups' activities, the directors of environmental organizations hoped to capitalize on Americans' increasing demands for environmental quality," the report stated. "Unfortunately, as many U.S. corporations have discovered, expansion away from an organization's core competency often has numerous disadvantages."</p>
        <p>The center's study has created a stir in the environmental movement, prompting both criticism and soul-searching.</p>
        <p>Some environmental leaders, like John Adams, the executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, say that the report's conclusions are wrong. Mr. Adams calls the report "a political document and not a scientific study," noting that the center's director is Murray L. Weidenbaum, the former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Reagan Administration, which was viewed as an enemy by environmentalists.</p>
        <p>Others say that a softening economy and the Clinton Administration's professed support for the environment is a more accurate explanation for the loss of backing for conservation groups.</p>
        <p>"The No. 1 cause of our problems has been the economy," said Ben Beach, the chief spokesman of the Wilderness Society in Washington. "When the economy went down, so did our membership. The election of Clinton and Gore also didn't help. Some people believed there was less need to support environmental causes."</p>
        <p>But the center's conclusions are being embraced by other environmental leaders as an accurate appraisal of some of the causes underlying the turmoil in their movement.</p>
        <p>"We in the not-for-profit business are subject to the same forces as any other business," said Ted Eubanks, a director of the National Audubon Society who has ordered 50 copies of the report to distribute to the group's senior leaders. "Our business is basically communications and we've lost the imagination of the average guy in the street."</p>
        <p>The study's authors, Christopher Boerner and Jennifer Chilton Kallery, are researchers at the center. They spent more than a year studying the financial statements, tax documents and other information collected from five of the most influential environmental groups: the Natural Resources Defense Council, the National Audubon Society, the Sierra Club, the Wilderness Society and the Nature Conservancy.</p>
        <p>Those five organizations, which in the early 1970's were either small or brand new, have become the core of a quite substantial nonprofit industry that employs thousands of highly educated professionals. The five groups still claim 2.1 million dues-paying members, down from a peak of 2.4 million in 1990. In 1993, they collected $396 million from membership dues, foundations, contributions and sales of publications.</p>
        <p>The Nature Conservancy, which alone accounted for $278.5 million in revenues and nearly $1 billion in assets in 1993, is cited by the authors as the only one of the five groups that has not been buffeted by declining revenue or membership. The study says the reason is that the Nature Conservancy, which avoids the political fray, also did not swerve from its sole mission of buying and conserving wild land.</p>
        <p>The other groups diversified at their peril. Starting with core campaigns in the 1970's to make the air and water cleaner and protect natural resources, those groups in the 1980's established large and elaborate programs to address a wide array of more scientifically complex and politically difficult issues like global warming and saving obscure animals. To support such work, the groups expanded their lobbying and public relations staffs, particularly in Washington, and helped to pioneer the media-driven techniques of modern public interest campaigns.</p>
        <p>The authors argue that the new strategy was not only designed to address an expanding menu of environmental concerns but also to attract the extra financing and membership that would support growth. From 1983 to 1990, for example, the Wilderness Society's budget more than quadrupled, to $17.9 million, from $4.3 million. From 1974 to 1993, the budget of the National Resources Defense Council grew to $20.5 million, from $1.5 million.</p>
        <p>Ms. Chilton Kallery and Mr. Boerner argue, though, that there were both limits to the financing available and the number of Americans that were truly interested in all the new issues. The competition for financing became so fierce, the authors said, that it led to two unexpected outcomes.</p>
        <p>First, to "differentiate themselves and rally public support, environmental groups began employing highly emotional, and often misleading, campaigns," the report said. "Organizations have used fear and apocalyptic prophecies to further their political objectives." For example, a recent fund-raising mailing from the National Audubon Society said the group could "project with some accuracy the eventual end of the natural world as we know it."</p>
        <p>"That is no trees," the letter said. "No wildlife."</p>
        <p>And second, such tactics helped generate a powerful countermovement of scientists, city officials, business executives and landowners who began to ask questions about the methods and priorities of national environmental groups. To some extent the critics have been joined by grass-roots environmental leaders who also have been attacking the national organizations as too bureaucratic and uninterested in the land-use questions and community pollution concerns that are important to many more Americans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boerner and Ms. Chilton Kallery said the critics raised doubts about the credibility of national environmental groups, an erosion that was responsible for slowing growth, and in some cases reversing budgets and membership. The Sierra Club now counts 500,000 members, which is 130,000 fewer than in 1990. Since 1990, the Wilderness Society's membership has fallen by 125,000, to 275,000 today, while its budget of $15 million is $2.9 million less than in 1990. The National Audubon Society recorded a deficit of $1.7 million in 1993 and is reducing its staff and cutting programs.</p>
        <p>The solution, the authors say, may come only after more cuts are made. "In order to regain their influence on public policy," the report said, "environmental big business should follow many of their private-sector counterparts -- trim down and stick to core competencies."</p>
