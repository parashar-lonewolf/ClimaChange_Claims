        <p>LEAD:  JAPAN</p>
        <p>JAPAN</p>
        <p>One of the features of the latest Republican National Convention was the fact that the word ''liberal'' was used throughout as a word with a very bad meaning. ''Liberals'' were criticized as the ringleaders in destroying order in the American society. Previously, liberalism had a brilliant sound to it as something opposing social, racial and dictatorial oppression. It was a synonym for American pride. Now, however, Dukakis is afraid of this label and has shoved it deep inside his desk drawer. . . . Is the same turn of mind that once considered ''Communists'' the enemies now aimed at ''liberals''? In the world of politics, particularly at election time, it is inevitable to label people either friend or foe. After all, the United States is a superpower with great responsibility for the entire earth. The Americans, as citizens of a superpower, should realize that the enemy of mankind is not actually the ''liberals,'' but something else. The fact that there are children starving in the Third World, that the destruction of the environment and the unproductive wars and oppression still continue; that is the enemy. There will probably be much debate in the United States from now until election day. We want the Presidential candidates and the American voters to ascertain through such debate what are the true enemies of mankind. - Asahi Shimbun, Aug. 19.</p>
        <p>For most Japanese the real issue in the United States election has nothing to do with Republicans or Democrats and everything to do with free trade. For seven and a half years there has been no sturdier ally of free trade in the U.S. Government than President Ronald Reagan, and, as a direct consequence, Republican candidates this year have been adamant in opposing protectionism. Mr. Bush is expected to continue the president's stance. Unfortunately for him, however, Japan is not voting in the U.S. election and the protectionist-minded American heartland is. Japan clearly has a problem with the Democrats. . . . In the Japanese view, the Republicans stand for free trade (read: undiluted access to the huge U.S. market), and the Democrats appear to be protectionists. This is a simplification, but it does put an interesting gloss on the reported suspicion that Japanese financial interests are trying to manipulate foreign exchange markets to insure a victory for Mr. Bush in November. . . . Though the trade stance of the Democrats makes us nervous, it is possible to argue that a Democrat in the White House might be a good thing for Japan. . . . Who better to restrain a Democratic Congress than a Democratic President? It is in any case time for Japan to have some free-trade friends in America's other political camp. Protectionism is the doctrine of the powerless; free trade on the other hand is all about economic confidence. And isn't that the very message of Governor Dukakis's much-vaunted ''Massachusetts Miracle''? - The Japan Times, July 28.  MEXICO</p>
        <p>The panorama on the American political horizon is a cause for preoccupation: Among the Democrats, Dukakis is of a pragmatic center while Lloyd Bentsen belongs to the most conservative sector; among the Republicans, Bush has traditionally been a moderate who is now building bridges toward the most hard-line right of his party. It seems as though November's Presidential contention will take place among different types of Republicans, and under the shadow of Reagan's political personality that is preoccupying because of what if means, for instance, to the future of the conflict in Central America. - Excelsior, Aug. 18.</p>
        <p>[ Dukakis ]  is . . . a reformer who came from the exile (as golden as it may be) of an immigrant family that conquered a nation and made it its own. He is on the left of the Democratic Party, more out of political conviction (in the style of Mitterrand) than because of an ideological frenzy. Dukakis has a memory of world events . . . He understands that shared world leadership (as a problem and as an option) will be the objective dilemma of the coming years. He is, in addition, of all the candidates of the last decades, the only one who speaks several languages: Greek, English, French and Spanish and, he says without irony, ''a little Korean.'' - La Jornada, July 30.  ISRAEL</p>
        <p>There is no need to hang Dukakis's statement on the matter of moving the American Embassy to Jerusalem, if elected, in a golden frame. It is enough to file it away in our file of party promises, before they came to power, starting with the ''Young Turks'' and the British ''Labour.'' . . . If the Democratic candidate's statement means anything it is that the Jewish vote is important to him. For that reason he seems to have needed to mention Jerusalem. - Yediot Acharonot, June 13.</p>
        <p>It's hard to tell whether the length of the Republican platform stems from the party's confidence or from a lack of clarity which the party has tried to cover up by so many words. .. . There is no doubt that we here in Israel can express our satisfaction with the way the platform deals with the Middle East issue. It is totally clear and supports Israel without conditions. . . . It is, however, necessary to stress that, like every platform, the Republican one will only be tested in reality. - Ma'ariv, Aug. 15.  ITALY</p>
        <p>In the anxiety to put together a perfect show as vain as a TV commercial, and to transmit at all costs an image of unity, American politics has become sick with centrist uniformity and with boredom. . . . The historical task of both  [ candidates ]  should be to bring their spaceships back on the planet, to come out of their TV studios, to fire all those advisers and scriptwriters and to speak as men to a population of human beings, not of remote-controlled puppets. - La Repubblica, Aug. 19.  INDIA</p>
        <p>Mr. Quayle has certainly made it very difficult for the Republican ticket to imitate Mr. Reagan who somehow managed to convey to the main street Americans that he shared their hopes and fears; instead Mr. Quayle will enable the Democrats to paint the Republican team as a bunch of rich boys who have neither the sympathy nor the empathy for the struggling middle class. Moreover, in choosing Senator Quayle as a running-mate, Mr. Bush . . . conveyed the impression that in his first act as the Presidential candidate he was a bit afraid to pick a towering figure. This would suggest that he prefers to avoid taking tough decisions, something a President is often called upon to do. In an election in which the Republicans want to make character a major issue, Mr. Bush could not have had a worse start. - The Times of India, Aug. 31.  WEST GERMANY</p>
        <p>Regardless of whether Bush or Dukakis becomes President, the European Community will feel some pressure from Washington and must get ready for some tough disputes with the U.S. . . . After all, both the Republicans and the Democrats expect their allies to step up their own defense spending. - Stuttgarter Zeitung, Aug. 19.</p>
        <p>Only one thing is certain, namely that there will be more government intervention in the job market under a Dukakis administration. . . . In the light of these uncertainties, it is not surprising that many of the Western economic partners are still crossing their fingers for a Bush victory. Some observers even interpreted the recent strengthening of the dollar as one such method to support Bush in the election camp. - Rheinischer MerkurChrist und Welt, July 29.  FRANCE</p>
        <p>If George Bush succeeds finally in finding the right tone, to affirm his existence and gain a minimum of respect from those who snicker at him, in a word to prove that he is something other than a boy from a good family, misplaced in politics, then anything remains possible for the Republicans. They can easily demonstrate that at the end of Ronald Reagan's second term, America is clearly more prosperous and the world closer to resolving certain major conflicts than eight years earlier. If, to the contrary, Mr. Bush misses this opportunity to re-establish equilibrium with his opponent, all he will be able to hope for is a miracle: that the Dukakis machine is suddenly derailed, but that is unlikely in that it is so solid and led with such carefulness. - Le Monde, Aug. 16.  SOUTH AFRICA</p>
        <p>Western leaders who were comfortable with Mr. Reagan's conservatism will no doubt hope for a Bush victory - as will Pretoria. . . . If Mr. Dukakis wins then South Africa can stand by in 1989 for the kind of sustained hostility it saw during the Carter years. But it will be more dangerous, because economic sanctions are now a very real factor rather than a remote threat. . . . Exactly what kind of chief executive George Bush would make is unclear. . . . Certainly he is well-versed in foreign policy whereas his opponent has a naive view of the world. - The Johannesburg Star, Aug. 22.</p>
        <p>One thing Bush and Dukakis have in common: They are both committed to a time-scale for change which South Africa cannot meet. Since neither, therefore, can possibly deliver the change which he is promising, Bush's renewed engagement may indeed be more dangerous than Dukakis's disengagement. . . . Whatever his reputation as a wimp, Republican Party candidate George Bush has shown a certain toughness of mind in spelling out a policy of engaging South Africa more directly, if not necessarily more constructively, when and if he is elected to the White House. - The Johannesburg Business Day, Aug. 3.  BRITAIN</p>
        <p>The U.S. election campaign officially starts next week, but the phoney war has been uninspiring. . . . On the central issue, as it must seem to most of America's trading partners, that of the management of a debt-ridden economy, we have until now heard only vague slogans. - Financial Times, Aug. 30.</p>
        <p>A victory for Mr. Bush on Nov. 8 would be in general NATO and European interests. It promises continuity. Mr. Bush, by background and instinct, is an Atlanticist who is personally and politically familiar to Western leaders. - The Times, Aug. 20.  SPAIN</p>
        <p>There is an American electoral principle that also works in other countries, which was seen in the recent triumph of Mitterrand. . . . According to this principle, elections are won in the center: It is the millions of voters who are found in this no man's land that extends through the Democrats and Republicans who decide election results. . . . The care taken by the Democrats to separate Dukakis from ''liberalism'' - which in the opinion of Americans is the same as being a leftist - was answered to strategically by naming as Vice President Senator Bentsen . . . The designation of Quayle . . . adds more of the conservative character to the Vice President and one can't guess at the electoral usefulness that this can have. - ABC, Aug. 22.  THAILAND</p>
        <p>If Mr. Bush is to be taken as his own man, he should be less apprehensive to declare his independence from the Reagan legacy. American voters may prefer their candidates to be well-packaged and slick-speaking, but they are not easily fooled. A man who rehashes the worn-out policies of the past eight years will be perceived as a salesman with only used goods to peddle. With Michael Dukakis preaching a fresh start, Mr. Bush is unwise to think voters will be satisfied with leftovers. - The Bangkok Post, Aug. 15.  CANADA</p>
        <p>To Canadian eyes, what passes for invective in this election is frequently bizarre. Consider a remark last Friday by Republican vice-presidential candidate Danforth Quayle. ''The man at the top of our ticket, George Bush, is a life member of the National Rifle Association, while Mr. Dukakis boasts that he is a card-carrying member of the American Civil Liberties Union.'' The Republican is good because he supports a group that helps Americans blow each other's heads off; the Democrat is bad because he believes in civil liberties. Note the resonant term ''card-carrying,'' used by that old Red-baiter Joseph McCarthy to brand people as Communist sympathizers. To be a ''moderate-talking liberal Governor,'' as Mr. Bush called Mr. Dukakis in obvious reference to former President Jimmy Carter, is to be soft on crime, hard on the flag and a menace to American values. No blow is too low. - The Globe and Mail, Aug. 31.</p>
        <p>Michael Dukakis, the Democratic Party's Presidential candidate, certainly sounds as though he appreciates Canadian concerns. He has, after all, heard some of them first-hand at meetings of New England governors and Eastern Canadian premiers. His promise of tough, effective legislation to control acid rain if he reaches the White House is a breath of fresh air to Canadians who never seemed able to persuade Ronald Reagan that acid rain wasn't caused by trees. To a Canadian, Dukakis sounds more like a red Tory than a Liberal, especially in economic and fiscal policy. . . . While he endorses the Canada-U.S. free trade pact, it is a sign that he tends more to freer trade rather than the Democrat's traditional protectionist stance. - The Toronto Star, July 22.</p>
