        <p>LEAD: The three winners stood on the podium, their official Olympic medals hanging from their necks as the crowd cheered.</p>
        <p>The three winners stood on the podium, their official Olympic medals hanging from their necks as the crowd cheered.</p>
        <p>Nuts to the crowd. Nuts to the medals. The three winners opened their envelopes and started to thumb through the $100 bills, from one to eight.</p>
        <p>This did not happen at a medal ceremony in Olympic Plaza, where 50,000 fans gathered Friday night. Athletes, as we all know, are too pure, too idealistic, to count the cold cash in public, while poets are worldly, realistic souls.</p>
        <p>In a smoke-filled cellar disco Friday night, poets were every bit as much Olympic champions as the pink-cheeked skiers and sledders winning gold medals out on the mountains.</p>
        <p>In an event called Poetry Sweatshop, regional champions competed against each other, writing poems in half an hour with television cameras looming inches from their fevered brows, with loyal fans cheering them from the gallery, with reporters ready to pick their weary brains.</p>
        <p>This was the real thing, part of the mandatory Olympic Arts Festival, but no cultural event in Olympic history prompted the raucous, bawdy, boozy, smoky passion of the Poetry Sweatshop.</p>
        <p>Poetry-by-the-clock is the product of Jim and John Coburn, identical twins and ham actors from Toronto. In 1983, John Coburn had stooped so low as to haunt poetry readings to meet the attractive, sensitive, intelligent women who frequent such events, that swine.</p>
        <p>Spotting the woman of his dreams writing a poem in a coffee shop, John dared her to complete her poem in five minutes. It took some coaxing, but she did, and then read it out loud and pronounced it the best poem she had ever written.</p>
        <p>The lovely poet has passed anonymously into history but in her honor the Coburn brothers linked up with Fred Hill, a semilegendary, semiretired publicity man from Toronto, to stage Poetry Sweatshops across Canada.</p>
        <p>Simple rules: the brothers enter to a coarse parody of ''Chariots of Fire'', tear up a Roget's Thesaurus, hand one page to each contestant, and ring a cowbell. Each poet must write a poem based on a word found on the page from the Thesaurus.</p>
        <p>Judges are usually culled from the para-literary set in each town and the prize is usually $25. But the twins managed to convince the Olympic arts group there was cultural merit in the Poetry Sweatshop and they managed to extract $50,000 from the Maxwell House Coffee people to put on a national scribble-off.</p>
        <p>The winners were assembled in Calgary on Friday, along with the provincial banners, demonstrating the great diversity of this far-flung nation: Shirley Stacey, St. John's, Newfoundland; Valerie LaPointe, Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island; Martin Wallace, Halifax, Nova Scotia; Nadine Murray, Fredericton, New Brunswick; Alison McGillivray, Montreal, Quebec; Leslie Locock, Toronto, Ontario; Jim Van Dusen, Winnipeg, Manitoba; Wilma Riley, Regina, Saskatchewan; Dawson Harmes, Calgary; Sheila Rosen, Vancouver, British Columbia; Barbara Wright, Whitehorse, Yukon Territory; and Lavona Clarke, Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. Or, as somebody once said, O, Canada.</p>
        <p>The one flaw was that there was not a single Francophone in the group, but Alison McGillivray explained, ''Two bilingual guys deferred to me at the contest in Montreal, very gallantly.''</p>
        <p>The cowbell was rung, and the poets created, some staring, some grimacing, some smoking, some smiling to themselves, to a noisy accompaniment of Bob Marley's ''No Woman No Cry,'' whatever that symbolized.</p>
        <p>The crowd urged them on. Nancy Dionne, a technical writer from Calgary, said she had paid $6 to attend because ''I'm in awe of poets.'' Asked if she could write under pressure like that, she smiled and said, ''Yes, I could - but not poetry.''</p>
        <p>When the cowbell tolled again, the poems were read silently by the judges, Tantoo Cardinal, a Native American actress from Hollywood and Edmonton; Moses Znaimer, entertainment magnate from Toronto, and Paul Martini, 1984 world champion with Barbara Underhill in pairs figure skating.</p>
        <p>Then all 12 poets read their works aloud, first explaining how they had chosen their word from the dozens on that single page of the Thesaurus, sort of a Rorschach test for poets.</p>
        <p>The judges conferred privately (''We ate some fries,'' the glowingly pregnant Tantoo Cardinal added) and then announced the winners.</p>
        <p>The bronze went to Barbara Wright's ''Heaven,'' which begins: ''God looks like Tina Turner/With the wisdom of Dr. Ruth/ She tells jokes to the angels/Rapid-fire, a little off-color/Then winks and chuckles like Lauren Bacall. . . .''</p>
        <p>Silver went to Nadine Murray's ''Anatomical,'' which begins: ''When life's little problems become astronomical/I like to think about parts anatomical/I like to remember the things I've seen. . . .'' and goes on from there, to lusty cheers from all the major genders.</p>
        <p>Gold went to Jim Van Duser's ''Affliction,'' a poem-cum-rap song which made absolutely no sense on paper, but had a truth of its own when blared into the microphone: ''Kids are screaming/And Mom is pacing in the hallways/Just can't take it/She's on the phone calling May Day/It's an affliction/She's losing control/. . . .'' with appropriate sound effects mixed in. You had to be there.</p>
        <p>The Coburn brothers staged an elaborate victory ceremony, plugging their sponsor outrageously, and then the deejay from the disco reassured all the regular patrons, standing in the hallway, that the poetry crowd would be leaving soon.</p>
        <p>Maybe so, but the Coburn brothers and their guru, Fred Hill, have established that poetry lives from the coal shafts of Newfoundland to the craggy fjords of British Columbia.</p>
        <p>Their next step? John and Jim plan to take their act south of the border to New York this spring. That's the way it works between the United States and Canada. We give them acid rain. They give us poetry.</p>
