        <p>You are no doubt aware that, along with vodka and the samovar, the Russians invented the light bulb, the automobile and the airplane. At least that's what some have claimed at one time or another. But you probably didn't know that the English invented Champagne. Well, neither did anyone else, but over the years that's exactly what some articles in British publications have claimed.</p>
        <p>Since the Middle Ages, and possibly before that, the English have been importing French wines. Four hundred years ago or so, the vineyards of the Champagne region produced quite a lot of the wine that eventually found its way to England. The wine, shipped in hogsheads and never meant to be bottled, would go through its second fermentation in the barrels, after it had arrived in Britain.</p>
        <p>As is often the case in history, different events that occur at approximately the same time, when brought together, can have a major effect on people's lives. With wine, these were the development of mass-produced glass bottles and the refinement of the cork stopper.</p>
        <p>Vintaged Bordeaux wines date more or less from this time, around the mid-1700's. The Bordelais had known for some time that their wine was capable of improving with age, but since the wine was stored in casks, it had been almost impossible to prevent it from oxidizing. Bottles and good corks changed all that. What's more, since the Bordeaux wines went through their second fermentation while still in the casks, there was no need to worry about the bottles exploding.</p>
        <p>In Champagne, it was a different story. There, the wine makers came to realize that they could produce an excellent sparkling wine if they could determine how to keep it in the bottle. Fermentation produces alcohol and carbon dioxide. In an open vat, the carbon dioxide escapes into the air. In a Champagne bottle, it is absorbed into the wine but exerts considerable pressure on the bottle - as anyone who has ever pulled a Champagne cork knows.</p>
        <p>Dom Perignon, the 17th-century Benedictine monk who served as cellarmaster at the Abbey of Hautvillers, in the center of the Champagne region, is credited with solving the problem. Reportedly, he not only discovered a method of controlling the fermentation, but also developed both a thicker bottle and a cork stopper strong enough to withstand the pressure built up by the still-fermenting wine.</p>
        <p>The first wine cork was said to have been developed by monks at abbeys in Spain and Portugal, where the cork trees grew, and to have been carried back to France by monks or other travelers who had made the famous pilgrimage to Compostela. These corks also found their way to England, and it is this fact, rather than any claims about wine making, on which some English historians base their assertion that Champagne was an English invention.</p>
        <p>It wasn't that they invented the wine; they were merely the first to use corks to capture the fermentation process in a bottle, beating even Dom Perignon. Needless to say, the Champenois shrug off such revisionist theories.</p>
        <p>''They'' - meaning the English - ''have been trying to claim for years that they really invented the cork,'' said Jean-Louis Carbonnier, of the Champagne Bureau in New York City. ''I think that's what this Champagne story is all about.''</p>
        <p>In fact, French chauvinism, where Champagne is concerned, while understandable, is somewhat misplaced. Consider, for a minute, some of the major names in the Champagne business: Bollinger, Krug, Mumm, Deutz, Geldermann, Piper, Heidseick and Roederer. It is difficult to think of any other business so clearly influenced by one particular group of immigrant entrepreneurs.</p>
        <p>Some of the Champagne-firm founders were born in territories that changed hands during the wars that have ravaged northern France since Roman times. William Deutz and Pierre Geldermann were born in Aix-la-Chapelle, which, for the present, is in West Germany and known as Aachen. Joseph Bollinger came from Wurttemberg and Johann Joseph Krug from Mainz. The original Mumm was from Rudesheim, and Florenz-Ludwig (later Florens-Louis) Heidseick came from Borgholzhausen in Westphalia.</p>
        <p>Most of the Germanic Champagne dynasties were created in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Europe was relatively prosperous and destined to become more so. French prestige and power were at their peak. Moreover, it was the beginning of the commercial age - a period that marked the emergence of a new, wealthy merchant class, the people who, from one end of Europe to the other, would become enthusiastic consumers of Champagne.</p>
        <p>Why those canny Germans were able to move in and set themselves up alongside the famous French houses - Moet &amp; Chandon, Ruinart, Laurent-Perrier - is not clear. Many of them were from the German wine regions, and perhaps their own backgrounds gave them an objective view of the enormous growth potential for Champagne.</p>
        <p>Little remains of the Teutonic roots of these Champagne firms, although one family at least actually returned to Germany. The Mumms, who had lived in Champagne for almost a century before World War I, found their entire business confiscated by the French government because none of them had ever bothered to take out French citizenship. The French sold the company in 1920 to a group that included the makers of the aperitif Dubonnet. The Mumms returned to Germany, where they continue to make sparkling wine in the Champagne style. Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons owns Mumm today.</p>
