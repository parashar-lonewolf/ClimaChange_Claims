        <p>Throughout the Stanley Cup playoffs, Florida Coach Doug MacLean has been sensitive to criticism of his team's cautious, defensive style. He has denounced published observations that the Panthers' tight-checking approach creates too many boring, low-scoring games.</p>
        <p>His defensiveness is understandable. MacLean is the rookie head coach of a third-year expansion team. His players, mostly hard-working veterans of modest talent, earned their berth in the finals by upsetting three better teams, and they played Game 2 of the championship round tonight against Colorado.</p>
        <p>It wasn't a dull game. It wasn't low-scoring. And MacLean's Panthers weren't boring. They were inept, perhaps, and even comical at times in losing by 8-1 to  the Avalanche, who took a 2 games to 0 lead in the championship round. Peter Forsberg scored three goals for the Avalanche. Rene Corbet and Jon Klemm each added two. Joe Sakic had four assists.</p>
        <p>The Florida goaltending was weak and the skaters lost their poise against a faster, more talented team. At least the coach tempered his recent displays of anger and sarcasm. After jokingly blaming the thin air of the Mile High City, he turned serious and bravely optimistic.</p>
        <p>"Sometimes, when this happens, maybe it's a good thing," MacLean said. "Who knows? I think we'll play very well Saturday night. It'll be a battle in the Rat's Nest. No question about that. We have to be better. I have no doubt we will be." The "rat" reference is to the plastic rats the Miami fans throw to celebrate goals, if any.</p>
        <p>For the first time in the post-season the Panthers looked like an overachieving team in way over its head, possibly on the verge of being swept. Despite taking a few penalties, they weren't always able to catch up to the superior opponents to hook, hold and interfere with them in their characteristic fashion that reduces superior foes to their level.</p>
        <p>Stu Barnes, who scored the only Florida goal, said, "It would be tough to be  any worse." Captain Brian Skrudland said: "It was worse than it probably looked. You hate to be embarrassed like this. We didn't deserve to be on the same rink tonight."</p>
        <p>Even if the Panthers win a game or two in this series, their chances of a championship are slim. The last team to win a cup after losing the first two games was Montreal in 1971 -- 25 years ago.</p>
        <p>Forsberg scored all his goals in the first period, two of them on the power play. Colorado Coach Marc Crawford said Forsberg is an unselfish player who, in  the European style, would rather pass than shoot.</p>
        <p>"They think shooting is cheating," Crawford said.</p>
        <p>Forsberg said: "Most people who watch me say I don't shoot enough. If I see a player in a better position, I usually pass it. I don't really care about the goals." He did manage to put 30 shots over the opposing goal lines in the regular season.</p>
        <p>It was the largest margin of victory in a championship round since Pittsburgh defeated Minnesota by 8-0 in the sixth and final game in 1991 to set the N.H.L.  record.</p>
        <p>Television viewers might have tuned out early, but the capacity crowd at McNichols Arena wasn't bored. The fans cheered early and often and stayed around to celebrate.</p>
        <p>"Stanley Cup!" the fans chanted in the final minutes. "Stanley Cup!"</p>
        <p>As the score mounted, Crawford began to rest Forsberg, Sakic and other front-line players. Perhaps he wanted to show mercy on the Panthers while resting his best for the coming climate change. They will move from the thin air to the heat and humidity of the Sunshine State for Games 3 and 4 on Saturday and Monday nights.</p>
        <p>As for starting goalie John Vanbiesbrouck, who gave up 4 goals on 11 shots in the first period, MacLean said, "Johnny has played 18 terrific games for us." Vanbiesbrouck said, "We have to trust each other and have some faith" in the upcoming games.</p>
        <p>Things didn't get much better when Mark Fitzpatrick replaced him after one period. "When you look up and the shots are 23-23 and you're down 7-1, it's a touch frustrating," MacLean said. "John Vanbiesbrouck will be a star on Saturday night."</p>
        <p>Forsberg joined the Avalanche last season, when they were still the Nordiques, based in Quebec. Although he was the first-round draft choice of the  Philadelphia Flyers in the 1991 draft, his rights were traded to Quebec while he was still in Sweden in the mega-deal that brought Eric Lindros from Quebec to Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>Forsberg gave Colorado a 1-0 lead at 4:11 of the first period, unassisted, by capitalizing on a turnover by Rhett Warrener, who lost the puck after a drop pass from Martin Straka. This was Vanbiesbrouck's weakest moment, setting the tone for the game.</p>
