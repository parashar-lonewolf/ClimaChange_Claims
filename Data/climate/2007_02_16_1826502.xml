        <p>AT the head of the Pine Pond Trail not far from his home in Lake Placid, N.Y., Jim McCulley revved his sleek black Ski-Doo. A fresh snow had fallen overnight, draping the pines that rise on either side, and Mr. McCulley, the head of the local snowmobile club, looked giddy as he set off.</p>
        <p>But his mood instantly soured at the topic of New York State's new plan to reconfigure hundreds of miles of snowmobile trails on public land. The plan introduced last fall strove to balance the needs of environmentalists and hikers with those of snowmobilers but has instead upset many people in both camps.</p>
        <p>It is the latest illustration of the constant tension in the Adirondacks -- and many state and national parks -- between those who prefer the quiet, albeit rigorous, contemplation of nature, and those who like to tackle the outdoors with more fossil-fueled gusto. Drawn up by the state Department of Environmental Conservation and the state Office of Parks and Recreation, the plan does not change the mileage in the network of snowmobile trails but proposes reconfiguring them by closing little-used trails in the sensitive interior parts of the forest preserve and opening so-called community connector trails on its periphery.</p>
        <p>Many snowmobile enthusiasts, known as sledders, say the plan does little to reflect the evolution of their sport, which has witnessed a major increase in the girth of the vehicles as riders seek to travel greater distances. While the new plan would widen some trails to nine feet from eight feet, some sledders had hoped for trails up to 12 feet wide -- raceways, environmentalists sniffed -- to connect communities and allow riders to pass each other safely without slowing down.</p>
        <p>''It's all about green bigotry,'' Mr. McCulley said. ''You have a group of people who look upon the working class who ride snowmobiles as people who are not capable of enjoying the forest preserve in the proper manner.''</p>
        <p>With most trails in the forest preserve now serving hikers and sledders alike, environmentalists worry that the new plan would turn many trails into de facto roads, noting that it calls for large groomers with treads akin to those on tractors or armored vehicles to smooth certain trails.</p>
        <p>Until recently, specially equipped snowmobiles were used to groom trails, which after a weekend of heavy activity develop uncomfortable moguls. But lately, snowmobile clubs have bought fully tracked vehicles, commonly called snowcats, to do the grooming. That has drawn protests from environmentalists who complain of trees' being cut back and trails' being widened and flattened, making them feel less wild year-round.</p>
        <p>''The foot trail experience is greatly diminished when you're walking on a dirt road in the sun as opposed to walking on a trail under a canopy,'' said Peter Bauer, executive director of the Residents' Committee to Protect the Adirondacks, a nonprofit group.</p>
        <p>The state agencies drew up the 404-page proposal, officially called the Snowmobile Plan for the Adirondack Park, after several years of public meetings and focus groups with local officials, private landowners, environmentalists and sledders.</p>
        <p>''The department believes that the plan does provide a balance between the environmental communities and the local communities,'' said Kimberly Chupa, a spokeswoman for the Department of Environmental Conservation. ''This is not an actual plan that has anything defined. It's more of a tool for the future to design the snowmobile trail system. Sort of like a blueprint.''</p>
        <p>Whether plan or blueprint, the recommendations are supposed to inform the decision-making of the Adirondack Park Agency, which governs land use in the six-million-acre park. The agency continually reviews management plans for 38 different sections, or units, of the park, a complex patchwork of private and public lands. Ms. Chupa said the agency would consider whether to remake the snowmobile trails in each unit as its plan comes up for review.</p>
        <p>There are some 840 miles of snowmobile trails in the 2.7-million-acre forest preserve, Ms. Chupa said, with many more on private lands. The state allows snowmobiles on designated trails in parts of the preserve classified as ''wild forest,'' but has kept them out of the more restrictive ''wilderness areas.''</p>
        <p>Over the last decade, local officials in the park have seized on the increasing popularity of snowmobiling to pump new life into winter tourism. But they kept hearing from sledders that the trail system in the Adirondacks was lacking; many residents leave the park to tour along the elaborate trail networks of Canada.</p>
        <p>George Canon, supervisor of the town of Newcomb, praised the plan for recognizing ''for the first time the economic impact that snowmobiling has on the communities of the Adirondacks.'' He predicted that the plan's call for improved ''community connectors'' and ''town-to-town networks'' would benefit the ''Adirondack economy during the long winter months.''</p>
        <p>SNOWMOBILES have become a flashpoint in the West, especially in Yellowstone National Park. The vehicles were banned at the end of the Clinton administration, which instead favored snow-coaches -- vans or buses on large skis or treads. But the Bush administration reversed that decision and, amid lawsuits from environmental groups, has done four environmental studies over the last five years to examine snowmobile use.</p>
        <p>The latest study, a preliminary document released in December, would maintain the current limit of 720 snowmobiles a day in Yellowstone, even though current daily use hovers around 250. The park does, however, require that all snowmobiles use noise- and pollution-control technology and that sledders travel with guides, who enforce strict rules.</p>
        <p>In New York, it is unclear when, or even if, the snowmobile plan for the Adirondacks will be implemented. Since its release, it has become bogged down in a thicket of technical and legal issues.</p>
        <p>Two elements appear to conflict with the Adirondack Park State Land Master Plan, the 1972 document that lays out use and zoning rules for the public land in the park. The creation of nine-foot trails, for example, runs headlong into the master plan's decree that snowmobile trails must have the character of a foot path. The Department of Environmental Conservation's policy defines a foot trail as a path not more than eight feet wide. And the master plan clearly prohibits the use of the large groomers on trails, though in recent years some groups have used them anyway. (Groomers are permitted on designated roads in the preserve that allow snowmobiles.)</p>
        <p>Now both camps are wrangling over language in the master plan that allows ''administrative personnel'' to operate motorized vehicles in the preserve for ''necessary maintenance.'' Historically, ''administrative personnel'' was interpreted to mean state employees. But the new snowmobile plan would let members of snowmobile clubs operate tracked groomers on certain trails on a regular basis. Ms. Chupa of the Department of Environmental Conservation said the permission ''has to do with our interpretation of what administrative personnel means,'' adding, however, that the Adirondack Park Agency is the ''final arbiter regarding interpretation'' of the master plan.</p>
        <p>Keith McKeever, a spokesman for the Adirondack Park Agency, said the plan was ''conceptual only and not legally binding.''</p>
        <p>''At this point in time we're bound by the State Land Master Plan as it's written,'' he said, ''and we're making our decisions in accordance with the plan.''</p>
        <p>Environmental groups argue that the introduction of the larger groomers in the preserve would require revision of the master plan. They seem confident that the extensive public hearings and environmental scrutiny inherent in that process would pose an insurmountable hurdle.</p>
        <p>Beyond the possible impact on the trails, some environmentalists also complain about the air pollution and noise snowmobiles create.</p>
        <p>''In the 1970s and early 1980s, there was a cheerful coexistence between cross-country skiers and snowmobilers,'' said Neil Woodworth, executive director of the Adirondack Mountain Club, a nonprofit group. ''But with the more powerful engines, they're operating much faster, and they just sort of dominate the trail network. When you have a number of sleds, the stench is such that the backcountry atmosphere is lost.''</p>
        <p>In recent years, forest rangers and state environmental officers have cracked down on both town officials and snowmobile club members who have illegally widened snowmobile trails and erected bridges on public property to make way for bigger sleds.</p>
        <p>But Mr. McCulley, the head of the snowmobile club here in Lake Placid, has undertaken his own campaign to show the destruction of trails by hikers and skiers. He has posted videotapes on YouTube of trails in spring, when hordes of hikers leave them looking like ribbons of mud. Other snowmobile enthusiasts, though less critical of the plan, feel that they gave more than they got. ''Right from the start we knew it was all about compromise, and they threw compromise out the window,'' said Jim Jennings, executive director of the New York State Snowmobile Association, referring to environmental groups.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jennings, who wanted the community connector trails to measure at least 10 feet across, believes snowmobilers compromised on safety. ''Snowmobiles are four feet wide,'' he said. ''There's a lot more traffic, and you have two four-foot-wide snowmobiles meeting each other on the trail.''</p>
        <p>With declining snowfalls in recent years, some environmentalists have their eye on what they see as a greater threat -- all-terrain vehicles, which are now banned from all state lands in the park.</p>
        <p>''If, because of climate change, snowmobiling is less likely as a recreational use, there will be great political pressure to allow A.T.V.'s in the forest preserve,'' Mr. Woodworth said. ''And A.T.V. enthusiasts like the power and speed and spitting mud. It's almost like a war on the environment.''</p>
