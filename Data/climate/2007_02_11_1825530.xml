Other programs on the schedule are scarcely less combustible: global warming, domestic surveillance and China. All the programs are already sold out.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosenkranz, who underwrites much of the cost for the evenings, said he wants to provoke serious discussion on important issues, something he believes is missing from the public discourse.</p>
        <p>''I think people are tired of the crudeness that passes for debate,'' said Mr. Rosenkranz, who modeled his group on a British debating society. ''There is a hunger for discourse on this level.''</p>
