        <p>The White House will announce today that according to an analysis by Government scientists, El Nino joined the Earth's continuing overall warming trend to break global temperature records in each of the first five months of 1998.</p>
        <p>Last year, the average surface temperature of the Earth was the highest recorded since people began measuring it with thermometers in the mid-19th century. The new information not only extended the record-breaking pattern, it did so to a degree that the scientists described as unprecedented.</p>
        <p>Moreover, said the scientists, global warming appears to be exacerbating the effects of El Nino, which have included droughts in some places and heavy rains in others.</p>
        <p>''We set temperature records in every month since January, and it appears that this general warming trend is making the effects of El Nino worse,'' Vice President Al Gore said in a statement issued by the White House. ''This is a reminder once again that global warming is real and that unless we act we can expect more extreme weather in the years ahead.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore was to present the findings at the White House this morning, with the scientists who performed the climatic analysis. An Administration official said Mr. Gore was trying to tell Congress that it is urgent to enact a $6.3 billion, five-year program of financial incentives and technological research aimed at cutting emissions of heat-trapping industrial-waste gases like carbon dioxide, which is produced by the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil. The measure is facing slow going on Capitol Hill, partly because of resistance on the issue from some parts of the fossil fuel industry and its allies in Congress.</p>
        <p>In one sense, the temperature findings are not new. Surface temperature records have been set several times in the 1990's, and mainstream scientists have said for some time that emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are probably at least partly responsible. But the year-to-year changes until now have been tiny, measured in increments of hundredths of a degree.</p>
        <p>This time, the global average for January through May jumped half a degree from the same period a year earlier. In the last months of 1997 and the first months of 1998, the natural warming of the Pacific Ocean known as El Nino was responsible for much of the increase in temperature, scientists have said all along.</p>
        <p>El Nino has faded, drastically so in the last three weeks, so it is questionable whether the records will hold up for the rest of 1998. The second half of the year ''is not likely to be as warm as the first part,'' said Dr. Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., who studies El Nino and global warming but did not participate in the new analysis. Still, he said, 1998 ''could turn out to be a record year, easily.''</p>
        <p>The January-through-May temperature jump was called ''really rather spectacular'' by Thomas R. Karl, senior scientist at the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, N.C., who was in charge of the analysis. ''To see every month breaking the record is rather significant.'' The first reaction of most meteorologists to a graph of the trend, he said, would probably be ''scratching the head and saying something must be wrong with the data.'' But he said that surface readings and those taken by different instruments on two Earth satellites show the trend, ''so we're very confident that 1998 far exceeds anything we've seen before.''</p>
        <p>For the five months as a whole, according to the Federal analysis, the average global surface temperature was 1.76 degrees above an average of 61.7 degrees for the bench-mark period of 1961 to 1990.</p>
        <p>The picture is partly explained and partly muddied by El Nino. On one hand, the exceptionally warm sea-surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific that are characteristic of El Nino are said by scientists to warm the globe generally. On the other hand, it is hard to know to what extent El Nino is responsible for the 1997-98 acceleration of global warming. But Mr. Karl noted that in 1997-98, the average global temperature was nearly a degree higher than the 1961 to 1990 average. This is twice as much above the bench mark as in 1982-83, when an equally strong edition of El Nino dominated the climate.</p>
        <p>If global warming is responsible for the extra heat, Mr. Karl said, then it is probably exacerbating the regional climatic effects that El Nino brought home so clearly over the last fall and winter: Wildfires, droughts and heavy rains. These ''are going to become more frequent in the future'' if global temperatures continue to increase as predicted, Mr. Karl said.</p>
        <p>A panel of scientists advising the United Nations has predicted that the average surface temperature of the Earth will rise by 2 to 6 degrees by the end of the next century, with a best estimate of 3.5 degrees, if greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced. This, they said, will disrupt the Earth's climate, causing climatic and agricultural zones to shift, increasing precipitation, making droughts more severe and forcing the sea level to rise.</p>
        <p>By comparison with the projected 3.5-degree increase, the Earth is 5 to 9 degrees warmer now than it was in the depths of the last Ice Age some 20,000 years ago.</p>
        <p>Last December, in Kyoto, Japan, more than 150 nations agreed to a diplomatic protocol under which industrialized countries were to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases by about 5 percent from 1990 levels by about 2010. The Kyoto Protocol, as it is called, is widely viewed as a first step in cutting the emissions. Delegates are meeting in Bonn in preliminary talks on details of the protocol.</p>
        <p>Dr. Trenberth said that the temperature increase in the first five months of 1998 is all the more remarkable because the warmth is well above an average that was already high because it included the effects of a global warming of about  1 degree over the preceding century.</p>
        <p>As for El Nino, its fading in recent weeks portends a more active hurricane season in the Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, several scientists have said. One of El Nino's effects is to suppress the formation of hurricanes in the Atlantic and Caribbean, and, consequently, last year was a year of relatively little hurricane activity.</p>
        <p>Dr. William Gray, a hurricane expert at Colorado State University, issues annual forecasts for the Atlantic basin. His latest forecast, made last week, called for an average frequency of hurricanes this year. It  called for six hurricanes, two of them major. It did not predict when and where they would develop, and whether they would make landfall.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Trenberth said the hurricane season may be more active than normal, for two reasons: El Nino is gone, and the tropical Atlantic is unusually warm, which favors hurricane development.</p>
