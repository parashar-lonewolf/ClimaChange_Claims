        <p>LEAD: SENATOR Timothy E. Wirth quotes the old Mark Twain line and takes it seriously: ''Everybody talks about the weather but nobody does anything about it.''</p>
        <p>SENATOR Timothy E. Wirth quotes the old Mark Twain line and takes it seriously: ''Everybody talks about the weather but nobody does anything about it.''</p>
        <p>Over the summer, it began to look to many people as if mankind had indeed done something to the weather. Shifts in rainfall and a national case of heat rash focused attention on the ''greenhouse effect'' that scientists had predicted would result from the burning of fossil fuels. And Senator Wirth, a Colorado Democrat who is chairman of the Energy Committee, wants to spend $4.3 billion on research to change it back, mostly through conservation and nuclear power.</p>
        <p>Those two strategies are especially important to electricity production, a growing segment of energy use and a major contributor to greenhouse gases. As the principal alternatives to fuel-burning generation, conservation and nuclear power are likely to dominate for years the discussion of how to meet the nation's energy needs. Deciding which to emphasize is deciding how to allocate money -on building plants or on improving the lightbulbs, refrigerators and air conditioners that use the power.</p>
        <p>The greenhouse effect is far from proven, but interest in it grew in the summer's heat. Mr. Wirth's bill, for example, is one of several introduced in the last few months to address the issue. Data on summer energy use have reinforced the sense of urgency. Peak Demand Peaks</p>
        <p>This summer, some electric utilities recorded demand 10 percent above old records. ''The growth in our electricity use is outpacing our electrical capacity additions,'' said Harold B. Finger, president of the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness, the nuclear industry's public relations group. ''I hate to think the country has reached the point where only a recession can guarantee that our electricity supplies are adequate.''</p>
        <p>If the greenhouse effect is real, it will mean even higher demand, according to experts, because summer needs will rise even if winter requirements fall.</p>
        <p>In earlier years, the utilities' choices would have been nuclear power or coal. But to those worried about the greenhouse effect, coal is the worst fossil fuel to burn because, per kilowatt-hour generated, it yields far more carbon dioxide than oil or gas. Last year, according to the Department of Energy, about 57 percent of the nation's electricity was made by burning coal, 11 percent from natural gas and less than 5 percent from oil. Nuclear power accounted for about 18 percent.</p>
        <p>''The anti-nuclear people have tended to see coal as a bridge to a non-nuclear world, and done their best to clean it up,'' said Charles Komanoff, an energy analyst based in New York. ''The nuclear people have almost bound up their nuclear promotion with coal, saying that coal and nuclear together are taking the U.S. away from oil.''</p>
        <p>''If coal is going to be banished,'' said Mr. Komanoff, ''it's setting the way for the ultimate slugfest, between efficiency and renewables on one hand and nuclear on the other.''</p>
        <p>The nuclear industry, which has has seen the cancellation of every plant ordered after 1974, sees a silver lining in the greenhouse cloud. The business has been atrophied for so long that no designs are on the shelf. But the industry is working toward a more polished version of the plants ordered in the early 70's, with standardized, more ''user friendly'' designs and refinements to allow faster, more economical construction.</p>
        <p>In the long run, reactor builders would like a different design, one that would not require the proper functioning of pipes, valves and pumps to prevent accidents. The industry insists that those components are reliable and cites ''probabilistic risk assessments'' showing risks so small that they are expressed in exponential notation instead of ordinary numbers. But that is no longer the point.</p>
        <p>''Clearly, the public does not accept the probabilistic risk numbers,'' said Dr. Richard J. Slember, vice president and general manager of the energy systems unit at Westinghouse Electric Corporation. ''They just don't understand them.''</p>
        <p>Officials at Westinghouse, which designs the water-based reactors, also point out the benefits of simply standardizing technology, instead of using a different prototype for each plant. The cost for a standardized plant, Dr. Slember said, would be under $1,500 a kilowatt of capacity. (In contrast, the Shoreham plant, on Long Island, cost more than $5,000 a kilowatt.) But environmentalists point out that Shoreham, now the only major utility construction project in New York State, is only 810 megawatts, and growth in the state last year was 704 megawatts. At that rate, a new plant the size of Shoreham would be needed almost every year just to keep up with demand.</p>
        <p>Mr. Komanoff calculated that for nuclear power to cut the use of fossil fuels around the world by half, the rate of completion of nuclear plants would have to rise to 16 a week between 1995 and 2020.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, environmentalists say, there is room for efficiency improvement. The United States used 56 tons of oil (or its equivalent in coal or natural gas) per $1,000 of production last year, while Switzerland did the same job with 34 tons, and Japan and Italy with 28 tons, according to the International Energy Agency. Environmentalists say that the United States could double effiency by using the technology now employed in Japan - which has done everything from modernizing industrial plants to relying more heavily on mass transit and striving for ever-higher gasoline mileage and ever more efficient home appliances.</p>
        <p>Mr. Komanoff figured that to cut fossil fuel use by half, world efficiency would have to rise 4.6 percent a year, ''60 percent faster than the rate of efficiency improvement in the U.S. during 1978-86, and 35 percent faster than efficiency was improved in Japan in the same period.''
