        <p>Germany Proposes Union In a European Federation  Chancellor Gerhard Schröder's governing party proposed a far-reaching plan to turn the European Union into a more centralized federal system.

        <p>Violence in Manila  Backers of the ousted Filipino president, Joseph Estrada, marched on the presidential palace to demand that his successor resign, and were met with gunfire and tear gas.
