        <p>"IT'S out here somewhere," the driver said, peering through the rain at the muddy dirt road. All we could see, except for the downs undulating off into the early spring mist, were fat Herefords gazing impassively at the sight of a taxi pretending to be a Land Rover.</p>

        <p>"IT'S out here somewhere," the driver said, peering through the rain at the muddy dirt road. All we could see, except for the downs undulating off into the early spring mist, were fat Herefords gazing impassively at the sight of a taxi pretending to be a Land Rover.</p>
        <p>"Ah, there it is!" the driver exclaimed, pointing down into a hollow so deep that the farm buildings in it were hidden by the slope dropping away from the side of the road. Cautiously, we began our descent. We had found Breaky Bottom.</p>
        <p>This was, improbably, wine country -- English wine country. I had come to Lewes by the 10 A.M. train from Victoria Station. The suburban sprawl of London fell away quickly after Croyden, and in little more than an hour I was in the heart of Sussex. I was searching for Breaky Bottom, one of England's better-known small wineries, and Peter Hall, its creator and owner.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hall, tall and rustically elegant in wellies and a scruffy silk neckerchief, met the cab carrying a newborn lamb. After a brief visit to the shed where another lamb, just born, was trying its shaky legs, we entered his home, a converted 1820's shepherd's cottage. Heat, a little, comes from the coal range in the kitchen, so we pulled up two chairs and sat facing each other in front of it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hall extracted a tin of Old Holborn tobacco and rolled a cigarette. "I was born in London," he said, "in Notting Hill. I always wanted to be a farmer, but I couldn't bloody well plow up Notting Hill." He studied agriculture at Newcastle University, and in the early 1960's took a job on a farm outside Lewes. "It was my postgraduate course," he said.</p>
        <p>One day, the farmer sent him out to find some stray ewes and he stumbled on Breaky Bottom (breaky means bracken in the local argot). "It's not Wuthering Heights," he said, "but it's remote and lonely. I loved it from the first."</p>
        <p>The farmer, who owned the cottage, let him stay in it. "I shoveled out tons of cow dung -- they were the only creatures who used the place -- and I mended the windows," he said. "And then I raised pigs for 10 years. I am grateful to those pigs; they enabled me to raise my family and they paid for my first vines."</p>
        <p>One day in 1974, he saw an ad for some vines. The English wine revival was in full cry and some of the best-known vineyards were only miles away. Mr. Hall liked the idea of growing grapes and bought the vines, Muller-Thurgau, a German crossbreed intended for northern climates. He also planted nine rows of seyval blanc, a French-American hybrid currently popular with East Coast growers in the United States.</p>
        <p>After seven years, he pulled out much of the Muller-Thurgau, which produces a soft reisling-style wine, and added more seyval. It makes a fresh acidic wine close in style to Sancerre and other French white wines based on the sauvignon blanc grape. "Didn't want to go all Germanic," said Mr. Hall, whose mother was French. Today he makes both wines from about seven acres of grapes. Oz Clarke, wine critic for The Daily Express, thinks Breaky Bottom wines are unquestionably England's best.</p>
        <p>The Romans made wine in Britain. So did the first Benedictines, whose appearance in England may actually have overlapped the final days of the Roman epoch. Monasticism waned in the eight century, and so presumably did wine making.</p>
        <p>Both flourished again after the Norman invasion. The new abbots were French and were used to good wine. The Domesday Book, compiled in 1084, listed 38 English vineyards. The last item in a copy of the Anglo-Saxon chronicle tells of Martin of Peterborough, "a good monk and a good man" who "admitted many monks and planted vineyards."</p>
        <p>Had not Eleanor of Aquitaine dumped Louis VII for the handsome Harry Plantagenet, Henry II, there is every reason to believe the English vineyards would have continued to expand. But Eleanor's dowry included Bordeaux. For the next millennium, the English would call claret their own.</p>
        <p>Vines continued to be planted in England and Wales and wine was made, but haphazardly and only for private use. Two diseases from America, powdery mildew and downy mildew, first detected in the 19th century, effectively killed off even the amateurs' vines.</p>
        <p>The revival of English wines began tentatively in the 1930's and took off soon after World War II, when Edward Hyams planted a vineyard near Canterbury, in Kent. The first modern viticultural research station in Britain was opened at Oxted, Surrey, in 1946.</p>
        <p>Since then, most English wines have been made by what the London wine writer Jane MacQuitty calls "eccentric gentlemen farmers and infatuated weekend wine makers." That is changing. There is a 65-acre vineyard in Wellow, in Hampshire, and the 250-acre Denbies estate in Surrey.</p>
        <p>Two long, dry and sunny summers in 1989 and 1990 gave rise to false hopes that the greenhouse effect had once again made England wine country, the way it had been under the Emperor Probus. In 1989, wineries in England, Wales and Ireland produced 270,000 cases of wine, an all-time record. And one that is liable to stand. In 1991, harsh spring frosts, rain, a late summer and a miserable autumn doomed all but a few vintners to thin, acidic, low alcohol wines.</p>
        <p>The country's entry into the Common Market makes its vinous future even more problematical. Overproduction of wine is a major problem in the European Community, which, pressured by France, looks askance at wines made from hybrid grapes like the seyval. Hybrids are banned in France. The community will admit only what it terms "quality wine," and that eliminates any made from hybrid grapes. Britain's Agriculture Ministry is fighting those rules.</p>
        <p>The Common Market notwithstanding, modern viticultural practices and carefully selected grape clones have brought wine growing back to England. Some farmers have uprooted hops and fruit trees to make room for grapes. But only the most optimistic vintners expect English wine to ever be more than a marginal agricultural endeavor.</p>
        <p>Peter Hall has no illusions about the harshness of his calling. Of the 15 vintages he has worked, fully a third produced no wine at all. In 1989, he made 27,000 bottles; in 1990, 20,000, and in 1991, 8,500.</p>
        <p>"I can actually get by on 10,000," he said. "Of course, I haven't had a holiday in 25 years and I work seven days a week."</p>
        <p>Well then, one has to ask, why do this?</p>
        <p>"Because," he replied simply, "I am stubborn and tenacious. And I happen to love what I am doing."</p>
        <p>His sheep bring in some money, especially the lambs, which he sells for meat. Picking up one of the bleating newborns on a walk around his property he says to it: "You're going to be delightful with a touch of garlic and some rosemary." TASTINGS  Corbett Canyon Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve, Napa Valley, 1989; about $8.50.</p>
        <p>People used to search for good wines under $5; now $10 is a more reasonable and attainable goal. This attractive cabernet fits somewhere between the two. Corbett Canyon is a big winery in the Edna Valley in San Luis Obispo County, far south of the Napa Valley, where this wine comes from. As befits its south-central California location, Corbett Canyon is noted mostly for its chardonnay and pinot noir. There is also a line of low-priced "Coastal Classics" in one-liter bottles. This cabernet is part of a line of slightly upscale "reserve" varietals that include a merlot from the Napa Valley and a local chardonnay. The cabernet is straight forward and medium-bodied, with little evidence of barrel aging. It's a relatively soft, easy-drinking wine that will go well with lighter summer meals that call for red wine. Who is it "reserved" for? Why you, of course.</p>
