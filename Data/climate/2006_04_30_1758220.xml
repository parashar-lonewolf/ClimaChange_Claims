        <p>DURING the first three months of this year, more than 90 brush fires scorched parts of New York City. In March alone, nearly 200 acres of Staten Island park and brush land were lost to the flames. Though brush fires are dismissed by some observers as a Western phenomenon, climatological evidence points to a different and far more disturbing conclusion.</p>
        <p>While arson, one of the leading causes of wildfires in the West, is certainly no stranger to the city, global warming is bringing drier weather and increasing winds to the Northeast. High winds can superheat already dry grasses and brush, in effect preheating the landscape. As a result, the smallest brush fire can become a city-devouring inferno.</p>
        <p>The big question then is this: Are New York City firefighters ready to battle these fires? Is the city prepared for them?</p>
        <p>The United States Forest Service and other agencies train firefighters to contain brush fires rather than confront them. It's fire fighting at arm's length. Firefighters try to prevent a brush fire's spread with things like trenches and backfires, which burn off the vegetation ahead of the blaze and deny it the fuel it needs. These tactics allow the firefighters space and time to flee if the fire moves in their direction.</p>
        <p>In cities, however, fire services are trained to protect property and rescue victims trapped in buildings, and that requires firefighting hand to hand. The urban firefighter depends on bringing heavy equipment like pumps and tower ladders as close to the fire as possible to knock it down with streams of water.</p>
        <p>But a brush fire moves too fast to reposition heavy equipment, often cutting off the retreat. In April 1963, the New York Fire Department got a taste of this as wildfires raged on Staten Island, moving so quickly that the firefighters could not reposition their engines quickly enough, nor find sufficient water to put out all the spot fires. No one was killed, but the Fire Department now has brush fire units, with special training and a few pieces of special equipment, but this is not enough. Every member of the New York Fire Department should be trained in how to handle brush fires.</p>
        <p>On Oct. 20, 1991, firefighters in the San Francisco Bay area learned the importance of training everyone when a wildfire broke out in the hills above Oakland. While the fire departments in Oakland and Berkeley were highly professional, they did not have brush fire training.</p>
        <p>For the 30,000 residents who fled and the hundreds of firefighters at the scene, it was a hellacious day. What made matters worse was that a brush fire burning beneath the surface of an empty lot reignited while firefighters were still digging out the embers from the first fire. Only the wind dying down and then shifting allowed the firefighters to return and overhaul the burned area. The fire killed 25 people who could not escape their housing and apartment complexes and caused more than $2.1 billion in damage to a five-and-a-half mile perimeter.</p>
        <p>Just as in this spring in New York City, the conditions in Oakland in October 1991 were ripe for serious wildfires: high wind, dry weather and combustible debris carelessly disposed of by homeowners and commercial users. Had similar conditions whipped a brush fire through, say, Queens or Brooklyn, the losses would have been far greater.</p>
        <p>Sadly, our cities have not taken the dangers of brush fire seriously. When cities were less densely populated, open spaces, empty lots and park lands served as natural fire breaks. Many of our early cities, like Philadelphia and Savannah, Ga., were designed around this concept, with large squares left free of buildings to prevent urban fires from becoming city-eating conflagrations. While the timbered houses were more flammable than the concrete, tile and steel of modern apartment buildings, they were only two or three stories high so that residents could escape fire more easily.</p>
        <p>Now, and especially in New York City, we have traded the safety of a dispersed urban population for the danger of heavily occupied skyscrapers, trusting in modern fireproofing. As we learned on Sept. 11, however, newer building codes are more lenient when it comes to fire prevention. Spray-on flame retardants don't provide the safety of the thickened concrete and fireproof tile that was required in the 1938 building code, the product of years of experience with skyscraper fires. The World Trade Center was essentially a high-rise fire trap waiting for a brush fire to climb its walls and scourge its interior. Had the blazes in the towers been treated as vertical wildfires instead of as conventional building fires, the lives of hundreds of firefighters may have been saved.</p>
        <p>When conditions for a serious wildfire are present, the National Weather Service hoists a red warning flag. Residents in the fire area are supposed to be ready for evacuation and fire services are required to prepare for an inferno. But who in the city knew that on March 15, the National Weather Service issued such a warning for the New York City region? Who was ready to evacuate? Who knew what routes to take, or what preparations to make? The impact of a wildfire could easily equal the impact of a storm like Hurricane Katrina, and we would be just as unprepared and as culpable for its catastrophic results.</p>
