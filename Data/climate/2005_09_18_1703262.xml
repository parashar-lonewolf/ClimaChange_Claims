        <p>I agree that the Indian Point nuclear plant warning sirens should work (''Siren Songs,'' editorial, Aug. 28). The major problem with the warning system is that it concerns potential problems only at Indian Point!</p>
        <p>Nuclear power has been far safer and more environmentally beneficial than most alternatives. The most serious problem at an American nuclear power plant occurred 26 years ago -- at Three Mile Island -- and resulted in zero fatalities and zero injuries. Compare that record to carcinogenic emissions, global warning and acid rain, as well as explosions from coal-, oil- and gas-powered electric plants.</p>

        <p>I agree that the Indian Point nuclear plant warning sirens should work (''Siren Songs,'' editorial, Aug. 28). The major problem with the warning system is that it concerns potential problems only at Indian Point!</p>
        <p>Nuclear power has been far safer and more environmentally beneficial than most alternatives. The most serious problem at an American nuclear power plant occurred 26 years ago -- at Three Mile Island -- and resulted in zero fatalities and zero injuries. Compare that record to carcinogenic emissions, global warning and acid rain, as well as explosions from coal-, oil- and gas-powered electric plants.</p>
        <p>Few Westchester residents know that two fossil-fuel-burning plants are located directly across the Hudson, and both have a history of problems. A 2001 explosion at the Lovett Generating Station, in Stony Point, injured a worker and required an asbestos cleanup. Both the Lovett plant and the Bowline plant in Haverstraw, directly across from Croton-on-Hudson, may be shut down because their emissions exceed environmental standards.</p>
        <p>Other potential dangers in the Hudson Valley that pose far greater safety threats than Indian Point include more fossil-fuel-burning plants, chemical plants and the Croton and Kensico Dams. Yet there is no systemic warning system for these potential dangers.</p>
        <p>Residents of Westchester County now receive a high level of protection from the remote possibility of a problem at Indian Point because of intense oversight by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and other government agencies, yet are shortchanged when it comes to more serious dangers.</p>
