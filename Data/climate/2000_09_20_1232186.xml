        <p>Editorial holds Pres Clinton's recent embrace of India and distancing of United States from Pakistan's military government is justified by India's growing importance, but should be accompanied by more pressure on India to exercise nuclear restraint and defuse tensions with Pakistan</p>

        <p>Two years ago, India's nuclear tests provoked worldwide condemnation and retaliatory sanctions by the United States. Yet in recent months, culminating in Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee's visit to Washington last weekend, the United States has drawn closer to India diplomatically than at any time since the early 1960's. President Clinton has shaped a new foreign policy course in South Asia by embracing India and distancing the United States from Pakistan's military government. These steps have far-reaching ramifications for all of Asia, including China, as well as for the issue of nuclear proliferation. The shift is justified by India's growing importance. But it should be accompanied by more pressure on India to exercise nuclear restraint and defuse tensions with Pakistan.</p>
        <p>Before the end of the cold war, American foreign policy in South Asia was characterized by Richard Nixon's famous decision that the United States should ''tilt'' toward Pakistan in its war with India in 1971. With the withdrawal of Russian troops from Afghanistan and the collapse of the Soviet empire, the United States and India have repaired their ties. A vibrant new generation of Indian immigrants to America has contributed to an era of good feeling, as has India's participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations.

        <p>Two years ago, India's nuclear tests provoked worldwide condemnation and retaliatory sanctions by the United States. Yet in recent months, culminating in Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee's visit to Washington last weekend, the United States has drawn closer to India diplomatically than at any time since the early 1960's. President Clinton has shaped a new foreign policy course in South Asia by embracing India and distancing the United States from Pakistan's military government. These steps have far-reaching ramifications for all of Asia, including China, as well as for the issue of nuclear proliferation. The shift is justified by India's growing importance. But it should be accompanied by more pressure on India to exercise nuclear restraint and defuse tensions with Pakistan.</p>
        <p>Before the end of the cold war, American foreign policy in South Asia was characterized by Richard Nixon's famous decision that the United States should ''tilt'' toward Pakistan in its war with India in 1971. With the withdrawal of Russian troops from Afghanistan and the collapse of the Soviet empire, the United States and India have repaired their ties. A vibrant new generation of Indian immigrants to America has contributed to an era of good feeling, as has India's participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations. India can still be a nettlesome friend. It has fiercely criticized American positions on global warming and nuclear weapons. But as the world's most populous democracy, it is a natural American ally on many issues.</p>
        <p>In improving its friendship with India, the United States needs to be particularly careful not to incite feelings of distrust in India's two wary neighbors Pakistan and China. The Senate vote yesterday to give permanent trade benefits to China caps President Clinton's welcome effort to stabilize relations with Beijing and to give Chinese leaders every incentive to open their nation to commerce and new ideas. India should now move quickly to sign the nuclear test ban treaty, which Mr. Vajpayee has promised, and to exercise more restraint on the deployment of missiles and production of fissile materials, since failure to do so will not only provoke Pakistan but raise anxiety in Beijing.</p>
        <p>The dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, India's only Muslim-dominated state, poses one of the gravest threats to world stability. In the last two years, it is Pakistan that has engaged in more provocative behavior by supporting guerrilla insurgents and, a year ago, sending its own forces across the border into the Kargil area. Mr. Clinton's pressure on Pakistan to withdraw the troops was successful, but it became a factor in a subsequent military coup last October by Gen. Pervez Musharraf. India was restrained in its response to Kargil, but its leaders need to do more to recognize that there can be no military solution to the Kashmir problem. In the end, greater autonomy must be granted to the region, and there should be more willingness to let the United States or other outsiders try to mediate a political solution.</p>
        <p>After meeting with Mr. Vajpayee, Mr. Clinton made it clear that he hoped to cement a new relationship with India that the next president could expand. That may be difficult, not only because of the uncertainty over the American presidential election's outcome but also because Mr. Vajpayee appears to be in frail health. His Hindu nationalist government contains some claimants to leadership who might revert to an unacceptably militant posture toward Pakistan. But if handled sensitively, this new phase of friendship between India and the United States, and America's warming relations with China, should be forces for greater stability in the region and throughout the world.</p>
