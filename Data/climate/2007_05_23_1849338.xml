        <p>Officials from California demanded on Tuesday that federal regulators allow the state to impose the strictest automobile and light truck emissions rules in the nation.

        <p>California's attorney general, Jerry Brown, told an Environmental Protection Agency panel here that the proposed standards on greenhouse gases were the most comprehensive effort in the nation's history to address issues experts attribute to the gradual warming of the planet, including melting ice caps, rising sea levels and rampant wildfires.</p>

        <p>Officials from California demanded on Tuesday that federal regulators allow the state to impose the strictest automobile and light truck emissions rules in the nation. They said that new regulations were needed to lessen the threat of global warming and threatened to sue if the government did not allow them to go forward.</p>
        <p>California's attorney general, Jerry Brown, told an Environmental Protection Agency panel here that the proposed standards on greenhouse gases were the most comprehensive effort in the nation's history to address issues experts attribute to the gradual warming of the planet, including melting ice caps, rising sea levels and rampant wildfires.</p>
        <p>''Protecting our planet is not a partisan issue, and the states now want to do what we can in the absence of federal action,'' said Mr. Brown, a former governor of California, ''and the E.P.A. has no right to deny us the ability to move forward.''</p>
        <p>A representative of the auto industry warned that adopting the new California standards would be ''counterproductive,'' raising the price of cars, costing jobs and imposing inconsistent auto emissions standards around the country.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown noted that the auto and oil industries objected to the new rules, but urged the E.P.A. panel to overrule them in the interests of the broader public.</p>
        <p>Eleven other states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, have said they will adopt the California standards if the federal government approves them. Together they account for roughly 30 percent of the American population and 30 percent of the vehicles on the road. Tailpipe emissions from cars and trucks account for about a third of all the greenhouse gas production in the United States.</p>
        <p>California is seeking a waiver under the federal Clean Air Act to enact its own emissions standards with a goal of reducing greenhouse gas production from vehicles by 30 percent by 2016. California officials argue that affordable technology exists to make cars run cleaner and burn less fuel, and thus produce less carbon dioxide and other pollutants that may contribute to global warming.</p>
        <p>E.P.A. officials gave no indication how or when they would rule on California's petition. Another public hearing is scheduled for next week in Sacramento, and the agency is accepting public comment for several weeks after that.</p>
        <p>Officials from the 12 states have said they will sue if the E.P.A. does not grant the waiver by October. The agency has granted California some 50 such waivers since the first federal clean air laws were enacted in the 1960s, and California has long been at the forefront of air quality regulation. California applied for the current waiver in December 2005.</p>
        <p>Steven Douglas, director of environmental affairs for a consortium of auto manufacturers, said the California rules would be costly and reduce the types and sizes of vehicles available to consumers, arguments the industry has used to oppose new fuel-efficiency standards.</p>
        <p>Mr. Douglas said the industry supported improving mileage standards, but warned that forcing automakers to increase mileage would cost jobs, make cars less safe and harm the economy.</p>
        <p>He said California had not proven that its new regulations would actually help slow global warming. He urged regulators to reject the tough new California rules and move more gradually toward national standards on emissions and fuel economy.</p>
        <p>''In this light,'' Mr. Douglas said, ''a patchwork of state-level fuel economy regulations as is now proposed by California is not just unnecessary but actually counterproductive.''</p>
        <p>Numerous witnesses at the E.P.A. hearing on Tuesday rejected those arguments, saying they were reminiscent of claims made by the car companies over the years to try to delay or defeat various safety and environmental regulations.</p>
