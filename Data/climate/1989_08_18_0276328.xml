        <p>LEAD: The nation's largest user of coal said yesterday that President Bush's acid rain proposal could wreck the American economy, and contended that it was ''one of the harshest, least flexible and most costly bills ever introduced in the Congress.''</p>
        <p>The nation's largest user of coal said yesterday that President Bush's acid rain proposal could wreck the American economy, and contended that it was ''one of the harshest, least flexible and most costly bills ever introduced in the Congress.''</p>
        <p>The statement, by the American Electric Power Company, which serves seven million people in seven states, was the first by a major company on the President's acid rain plan. It may signal rough going for the proposal in Congress, where the utilities have a track record of successful lobbying.</p>
        <p>The Bush proposal would effectively make building new electric plants impossible, and even operating old ones at full power would be barred, the company said. ''Our nation would find the anomalous situation of energy shortages coexisting with substantial unused generating capacity at existing power plants,'' said W.S. White Jr., chairman of the company.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency, Christian Rice, replied, ''We don't accept their claim that doomsday is near.'' Mr. Rice said that he had not seen the American Electric statement but that technology was available for pollution control. Utilities have sufficient flexibility to operate under the proposed law, he said.</p>
        <p>The President's bill calls for utilities that want to build new power plants to obtain ''emissions offsets'' by reducing the pollution output of existing plants by an amount equal to what the new one would produce. But Mr. White said that emissions offsets would gradually be used up, and ''it may become impossible to find additional offsets at any price.''</p>
        <p>Several utilities and the Edison Electric Institute responded critically to a White House position statement on acid rain in June, and American Electric said that the bill itself was tougher than the position statement.</p>
        <p>The company said it had sent letters to its largest customers - some industrial customers could see rate increases of 39 percent - seeking to enlist them in the battle against the bill. The company said that residential customers would also suffer, with an average rate rise of 12 percent.</p>
        <p>A. Joseph Dowd, senior vice president and general counsel of the company, said in a telephone interview that the bill, if enacted, would make a system like American Electric's much more difficult to run because it would set caps on emissions on a plant-by-plant basis. If a mechanical failure or other special circumstance made the company want to run one coal-generating station and shut down another, he said, it would have to get permission from the E.P.A.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dowd said that the reason the sharpest rate increases would fall on industrial customers was that their price of electricity was tied by supply contract to the costs at specific coal stations. For example, Ormet, an aluminum smelter in Hannibal, Ohio, buys its power from his company's Kammer plant, in West Virginia, and to install anti-pollution equipment at Kammer would make costs rise nearly 40 percent, he said. The utility says that such big cost increases would make some of its industrial customers uncompetitive internationally.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rice of the E.P.A. said, ''We do agree that there will be, for some specific utilities, some rate increases well above the national average.'' But, he added, some areas of the country, particularly the Midwest, have enjoyed low electricity costs for years.</p>
