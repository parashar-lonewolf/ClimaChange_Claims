        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"Scientists Confront Renewed Backlash on Global Warming" (Science Times, Sept. 14) well documents the absence of any scientific consensus on the existence of enhanced greenhouse warming, on the magnitude of any future temperature increase, and on whether any such climate change would be harmful or beneficial. It is important to emphasize this uncertainty in order to counteract unsupported claims that "all scientists agree."</p>
        <p>Such claims are being used to justify economically harmful policies to limit energy use by imposing special taxes or other restrictions. In his 1992 best seller, "Earth in the Balance," then-Senator Al Gore wrote that 98 percent of all experts agreed with his cataclysmic view of future global warming. As your article shows, this is clearly not the case.</p>
        <p>Your article requires some elaboration. Climatologists no longer believe carbon dioxide, the most important man-made greenhouse gas, stays in the atmosphere "for centuries"; better data have reduced this "lifetime" to about 40 years. This means policy steps can be safely delayed pending better evidence.</p>
        <p>At last year's Earth Summit in Rio, politicians were led to believe that carbon dioxide concentrations would double by as early as 2025. You report a revised date of 2100, an estimate more in line with the shorter lifetime. In fact, carbon dioxide may never double, partly because of the limited availability of fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>You also report that today's greenhouse gas concentration has already moved halfway toward a doubling over the pre-industrial value. According to the "best" computer models, one would expect global temperatures to be increasing at the rate of 0.5 degree Fahrenheit per decade, an easily detectable amount. The best available data, however, taken with globe-circling satellite instruments since 1979, show no increase at all.</p>
        <p>As observations and theory diverge more strongly with each passing year, it becomes more certain there is something very wrong with the computer models that have been used to scare the world public and their governments into considering drastic, hasty actions.
