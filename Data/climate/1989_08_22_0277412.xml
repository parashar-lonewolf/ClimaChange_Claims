        <p>The advance and retreat of massive landscapes of ice, which has been repeated in cycles for eons, may be governed at least in part by the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmophere, researchers at the University of Chicago have reported.</p>
        <p>Researchers have for years studied the causes of the great 80,000-year-long ice ages and the warm 20,000-year intermissions between them. Two researchers, D. R. Lindstrom at the University of Illinois at Chicago and D. R. MacAyeal of the University of Chicago have now studied the records of ice cores from Scandinavia, Siberia, and ice shelves in the Arctic Ocean to test the idea that the rising and falling levels of carbon dioxide alone could have accounted for the swelling and shrinking of the planet's ice.</p>
        <p>Using computers, they simulated ice and atmosphere of the past 30,000 years. They found that the increase in carbon dioxide from about 190 parts per million parts of air up to 290 parts per million at the end of the ice age was enough to heat the earth and melt the glacial ice.</p>
        <p>''What we show here is that carbon dioxide really can change climate,'' Dr. MacAyeal said. '' We aren't just speculating about how changes in carbon dioxide might alter our climate in years to come, we're showing that it already has.''</p>
        <p>The earth is now coming to the end of a warm interglacial period, but instead of declining levels of carbon dioxide leading to cooling of the earth, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen to 350 parts per million because of the burning of fossil fuel.</p>
        <p>''Earth's climate went topsy-turvy as a result of a relatively minor change in the atmosphere's carbon dioxide,'' Dr. MacAyeal said. ''If ice ages can be driven by a 50 percent increase in carbon dioxide, what will happen if carbon dioxide doubles from man's activities over the next few decades?''  SCIENCE WATCH</p>
