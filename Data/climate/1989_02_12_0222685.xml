        <p>LEAD: The world can expect widespread economic decline and social disruption in the 1990's unless national leaders make a serious commitment to reverse the deterioration of the earth's environmental systems, a Washington-based research group said today.</p>
        <p>The world can expect widespread economic decline and social disruption in the 1990's unless national leaders make a serious commitment to reverse the deterioration of the earth's environmental systems, a Washington-based research group said today.</p>
        <p>The group, the Worldwatch Institute, said the major natural catastrophes of 1988 - further depletion of the ozone layer, the North American drought and the disastrous flooding in Bangladesh - provided a worrisome glimpse of a future in which environmental changes go unchecked. ''Unless the threats of climate change, ozone depletion, soil erosion, deforestation, and population growth are brought under control soon, economic decline may be inevitable,'' said Lester R. Brown, president of the institute and director of the study.</p>
        <p>The report, ''State of the World 1989,'' recommends strategies for nations to reverse the most threatening trends. It focuses on four key areas: climate protection, reforestation, food production, and reducing population growth in the third world.</p>
        <p>''Time is not on our side,'' Mr. Brown said. ''We have years, not decades, to turn the situation around, and even then there is no guarantee that we will be able to reverse the trends that are undermining the human prospect, but if we do, it will be during the 90's. Beyond that it will be too late.''</p>
        <p>The report recommended that national energy policies be directed to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuels, the principal cause of the so-called greenhouse effect, or global warming. The burning of coal and other fuels such as oil and natural gas releases carbon dioxide that traps heat in the lower atmosphere, allowing temperatures to rise.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the large-scale clearing of tropical forests adds carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, hastening the greenhouse effect. ''If energy policymaking continues to be the domain of short-term thinking and narrow political considerations, there can be little hope,'' Mr. Brown said. The report suggested establishing international efficiency standards for automobiles, lighting systems, and electrical appliances. The report said that the world's 400 million cars currently average 20 miles per gallon of gasoline, emitting 547 million tons of carbon into the atmosphere each year. ''Setting a fuel standard for new cars of 50 miles per gallon by the year 2000 would be an important step toward climate stability,'' the report said.</p>
        <p>The destruction of forests in many countries has caused several disasters, the report said. The dependency of millions on firewood for fuel has increased rainfall runoff and triggered widespread flooding in Bangladesh, India, the Sudan, Thailand and elsewhere. It has also speeded the extinction of plant and animal species.</p>
        <p>As forests are cleared and burned, carbon is released into the atmosphere, speeding up the warming.</p>
        <p>The report also found that the world's food production had dropped 14 percent per capita since 1984, and is now at the level of 1970. It named the North American drought, soil erosion, encroachment of desert in Africa, and scarce land and water as the main reasons for the slower growth.</p>
        <p>Copies of the report may be obtained from Worldwatch Institute, 1776 Massachusetts Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036. The price is $18.95 for the hard-cover edition and $9.95 for the soft-cover.</p>
