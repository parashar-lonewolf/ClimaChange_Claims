        <p>A3-12</p>
        <p>Bush Tells Both Sides To Cool Mideast Conflict  President Bush, in some of his most expansive statements on the Middle East since taking office, said Yasir Arafat should hear ''loud and clear'' that the United States wanted him ''to stop the violence.'' But Mr. Bush also urged Israel to exercise restraint in its military actions.</p>
        <p>A10</p>
        <p>Israeli officials indicated that their bombardments of an Arab village on Wednesday could be the start of an offensive against ''terrorists and their infrastructure.'' A leader of the Palestinian Fatah movement warned that it would take its violent activities beyond the West Bank and Gaza if Israeli strikes continued.</p>
        <p>A7</p>
        <p>Bush to Meet Brazil's Leader  President Bush and President Fernando Henrique Cardoso will meet today in Washington, in advance of a summit meeting of hemispheric heads of state next month.</p>

        <p>Action on Argentine Economy  The new economy minister, Domingo Cavallo, won congressional passage of his emergency financial package, giving the shaky government some relief and giving investors hope that a default could be averted.</p>

        <p>Clashes Cross Kosovo Border  Fighting between Macedonian forces and ethnic Albanian rebels spilled into Kosovo, killing 3 people and wounding 16. A mortar attack narrowly missed foreign peacekeepers patrolling in Kosovo. A British journalist was among those killed.</p>

        <p>Missing Words on Russian Tape  The Russian voice-over on an audio tape broadcast on state television -- which purported to show that a Russian scholar was a spy -- contained information involving accusations of American espionage that did not exist on the actual recording.</p>

        <p>Campaign Finance Bill Clears Big Senate Hurdle  The Senate, voting 57 to 43, rebuffed a bid that would have undercut the entire McCain-Feingold campaign finance bill if the Supreme Court struck down any part of it. That ended the last major Senate challenge to the effort to ban unrestricted donations to political parties. A final Senate vote is expected on Monday.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>McCain-Feingold appears to enjoy even greater bipartisan support in the House than in the Senate, but it faces an adamant and powerful foe in the Republican whip, Tom DeLay.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>House Backs Two Tax Cuts  The House approved two elements of President Bush's tax-cut plan -- lowering taxes for married couples and doubling the tax credit for families with children -- and moved toward abolition of the estate tax.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Looking Elsewhere for Energy  President Bush said he was prepared to exploit oil and gas resources elsewhere in the nation on land that was not federally protected, if his plans for oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge were blocked.</p>
        <p>A13</p>
        <p>No Decision on Drug Strategy  A report commissioned by the Clinton White House takes no position on the relative effectiveness of drug enforcement versus drug treatment, saying data and research are inadequate to draw any conclusions.</p>
        <p>A17</p>
        <p>New Minority in California  Non-Hispanic whites are officially a minority in California, amounting to just under half the population, census figures show. Hispanic residents, now nearly one-third of the state's population, account for nearly 9 out of 10 new Californians.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Charter Jet Crashes in Aspen  A Gulfstream jet owned by a Hollywood producer crashed near Sardy Field in the Colorado ski resort town, killing all 15 passengers and 3 crew members, officials said.</p>
        <p>A17</p>
        <p>Children Staying in Foster Care  An Atlanta judge has decided not to release 41 children from foster care, where they had been placed after an inquiry by state authorities concluded that nearly 60 children had been seriously beaten by their parents and leaders of their church.</p>

        <p>Suspect in Sniper Killing Is Arrested in France  James Charles Kopp, 46, a fugitive anti-abortion activist, was arrested in France. He is accused of murdering Barnett Slepian, a doctor in Amherst, N.Y., who performed abortions.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>A Brooklyn couple active in the antiabortion movement, Dennis John Malvasi and Loretta Claire Marra, were charged with trying to sneak Mr. Kopp into the United States.</p>

        <p>EDUCATION</p>
        <p>Vote on Privatizing Schools  Prospects that Edison Schools would win a contract to run five failing New York City public schools appeared dim, as turnout among parents was light in voting at four of the schools and strong at one school where opposition to the plan has been strong.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Catholic School Cutbacks  The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York announced broad cutbacks that are likely to lead to the closing of six financially failing parish elementary schools.</p>

        <p>Whitman Hears Complaints  An international conference of environment ministers in Montreal produced complaints to E.P.A. Administrator Christie Whitman on a Bush administration decision not to support the Kyoto Protocol on climate.</p>
        <p>A13</p>
        <p>Interests in Project Questioned  A federal judge has temporarily barred backers of an Energy Department laser project at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory from citing an expert panel's evaluation, a decision suggesting that the panel may have been stacked with people who have a stake in the project.</p>

        <p>Parts Maker Cutting Jobs  Delphi Automotive Systems, the world's largest maker of auto parts, will eliminate 11,500 jobs this year, or 5.5 percent of its work force, mainly by not hiring replacements for retirees but also through layoffs.</p>
