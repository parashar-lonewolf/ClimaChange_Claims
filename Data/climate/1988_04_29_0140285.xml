        <p>LEAD: Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada, completing a two-day state visit here, said today that President Reagan had agreed to a high-level discussion of Canada's plan to reduce acid rain that crosses the border between the two countries.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada, completing a two-day state visit here, said today that President Reagan had agreed to a high-level discussion of Canada's plan to reduce acid rain that crosses the border between the two countries.</p>
        <p>Acid rain moving from the United States to Canada is a major irritant in relations between the two nations. The Reagan Administration has repeatedly rebuffed Canada's request for a treaty that would address this problem.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mulroney did not obtain an agreement this time, but Mr. Reagan, as he did at their last summit meeting last year, left the door slightly open to such a pact.</p>
        <p>At a news conference before his departure, Mr. Mulroney reported that the President, at a private lunch today, had said he would ask Secretary of State George P. Shultz to hold talks with the Canadian Minister of External Relations, Joe Clark, on Canada's proposal for an acid rain agreement.</p>
        <p>In response to questions, Mr. Mulroney acknowledged that he had received no concrete concessions on acid rain from the President but said he viewed the progress made on the issue ''with encouragement.''</p>
        <p>Canadian and American environmentalists, however, said Mr. Mulroney's treaty proposal was essentially the same as one made a year ago in Ottawa, which Mr. Reagan promised to consider but subsequently rejected. The environmentalists contended that the promise of holding talks was only a political sop to Mr. Mulroney to help him face criticism when he returns to Canada.</p>
        <p>Michael Perley, executive coordinator of the Canadian Coalition on Acid Rain, said the pledge to have the proposal discussed by Mr. Shultz and Mr. Clark was ''meaningless.'' He noted that the two foreign ministers had already discussed virtually the same proposal without reaching agreement.</p>
        <p>When pressed by questions on his failure to obtain agreement on specific targets and timetables for reducing acid rain, Mr. Mulroney said, ''What do you do - declare war or persuade Americans of the value of acting?''</p>
        <p>Acid rain is pollution from the burning of coal and oil that is transformed chemically in the atmophere to acidic rain, snow, fog or dry particles. According to the Canadian Government, more than 700,000 of its lakes have become acidified, and its forests, structures and even the health of its citizens are being damaged by acid rain, more than 50 percent of which Canada contends comes from the United States.</p>
