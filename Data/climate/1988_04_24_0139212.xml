        <p>LEAD: THE onetime residents of a secluded river valley in Massachusetts cannot go home again because the four little towns in which they lived are no longer there.</p>
        <p>THE onetime residents of a secluded river valley in Massachusetts cannot go home again because the four little towns in which they lived are no longer there.</p>
        <p>They can, however, get together and talk about long-gone days when cattle drowsed in the shade on sultry afternoons and church bells sounded over meadows where children went forth to gather flowers, or to fish for brook trout with a piece of string, a worm-baited hook and a sapling for a pole. They will recall such things Wednesday night at the University of Massachusetts, where a ''remembrance ball'' is being held for them.</p>
        <p>Fifty years ago on April 27, there was a farewell ball in the Swift River Valley. A thousand residents of the four towns - Dana, Prescott, Enfield and Greenwich - and of other, smaller communities gathered in Enfield's town hall to say goodbye to each other and their homes. For about a decade, the creation of the gigantic Quabbin Reservoir had been under way, and although many buildings still remained, all the towns officially ceased to exist that night at midnight.</p>
        <p>Located in central Massachusetts, the Quabbin, one of the largest domestic water-supply impoundments in the country, was created to provide water for the Boston area, which by 1920 was exhausting its reservoirs. In 1927, the State Legislature passed the Swift River Valley Act, which gave birth to the Quabbin, whose long, ragged north-south fingers embrace nearly 39 square miles of water surface with 118 miles of shoreline. The area to be flooded was emptied of buildings and trees by 1939, and the reservoir was full by 1946.</p>
        <p>Lois Doubleday Barnes, 67 years old, of Leverett, Mass., remembers her family making a temporary move from sparsely populated Prescott, the first town to empty, to Greenwich. ''It was a strange growing-up period, but one certainly became accustomed to change,'' she said. ''I can't remember anytime when we weren't discussing the selling of property or those who had already moved out.</p>
        <p>''In some ways it was exciting to a child. . . . people were coming in even as others were leaving . . . but toward the end it was traumatic. They scoured the valley. It was as if it had been devastated by war . . . huge fires fed by trees, brush and buildings burned day and night.''</p>
        <p>About 2,500 people had to leave the valley, and most were preceded by 7,561 of their ancestors, who were exhumed and re-buried in Quabbin Park Cemetery, which is just south of the reservoir.</p>
        <p>This endeavor had one startling flaw: The graves - 34 cemeteries were involved - are scattered randomly with no consideration paid to their original arrangement. Some graves not marked with names were also dug up. They were probably those of Nipmuck Indians who once lived in the valley. Pushed out by white settlers in the first half of the 18th century, the Nipmucks had called the place Qaben, meaning ''meeting of the waters,'' which include the Swift River and its east and west branches.</p>
        <p>The exodus embraced the era of the Great Depression. Even as some landowners accepted offers from the reservoir's builders and moved out, impoverished newcomers moved in. Because the buildings would soon be razed, an entire farm could be rented for $5 to $30 a month. The land was good, and a man could have a vegetable garden and find whatever work he could to keep his family fed until the nation recovered, or until the bulldozers arrived.</p>
        <p>Many former residents remember the anguish of their parents, but they also know that the reservoir has saved the area from housing developments and shopping malls. A pure and magnificent lake that offers superb angling for salmon and brown, rainbow and lake trout, pickerel, perch and black bass, it is relatively safe from degradation save that caused by acid rain. The forest around it is a wildlife refuge in which only hiking is permitted. Bald and golden eagles, ospreys and waterfowl visit in season, and beavers, muskrats, wild turkeys, deer, coyotes, bobcats and otters live there year-round.</p>
        <p>That the integrity of this pocket of wilderness, as well as its history, be preserved are the goals of Friends of Quabbin, an organization founded by Les and Terry Campbell in 1984. Mrs. Campbell is manager of the Metropolitan District Commission's Quabbin Visitors Center, whose activities include Tuesday meetings for those who once lived in the drowned valley.</p>
        <p>Both Ms. Barnes and another one-time Prescott resident, 74-year-old Eleanor Griswold Schmidt, of Belchertown, Mass., are determined that the exodus not be forgotten. They ask that former residents or their descendants write either the Quabbin Visitors Center, 485 Ware Road, Belchertown, Mass. 01007, or the Swift River Valley Historical Society, Inc., P.O. Box 24, New Salem, Mass. 01355.</p>
        <p>''We are looking for those who have disappeared,'' said Mrs. Schmidt, ''just to touch them and to let them know that there is a place where their folks are being remembered.''  OUTDOORS</p>
