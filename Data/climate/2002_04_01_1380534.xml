      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial on news that Rhode Island-size piece of ice has broken apart from ice shelf of Antarctica and collapsed into pieces, creating small sea of open water where there had been none in thousands of years; says there is growing suspicion among Antarctic specialists and others that likeliest explanation is global warming; says news of such a dramatic change in topography of Antarctic ice is reminder that continent implicates all of us, and vice versa, in ways that would once have seemed unimaginable</p>

        <p>Small as it conventionally sounds, Rhode Island is still a fairly large chunk of territory. If it broke off the mainland of North America and drifted away in fragments, that event would get our attention. In recent weeks, a floating province of ice, Rhode Island-size, has broken apart from the Larsen B ice shelf of Antarctica and collapsed into pieces, creating a small sea of open water where there had been none in thousands of years. In Antarctica, ice is almost geological in its expanse and its time scale. To see this breakup come so quickly has astonished the scientists who know that part of the world best.</p>
        <p>For most of us, the fact of the ice sheet's collapse is less interesting than the question of its cause. Scientists can trace the proximate causes that doomed the ice sheet, especially a large increase in summer temperatures in that region. They can map the inherent dynamism in that fringe of ice and show what tensions and abrasions, what shifts in local climate, led to its disintegration. The rest of us imagine the sound of Antarctic ice eroding catastrophically and think ''global warming'' and grow a little impatient with the proper cautions of science. The picture on the frigid continent is admittedly confusing. In some places temperatures seem to be falling and the ice seems to be thickening, while elsewhere the opposite is true. But even among Antarctic specialists, there is a growing suspicion that no matter how contradictory the evidence may seem at first, the likeliest explanation for this event of Rhode Island-size magnitude may indeed be the obvious suspect.</p>

        <p>There was a time not all that long ago when to think about Antarctica was mainly to think about the humans who had gone there to explore it. Shackleton, Amundsen, Scott -- these were men who imposed their narratives on a place that most people were comfortable thinking of as the blankness beneath the rest of the world. What has begun to replace those heroic and often tragic sagas is the very different saga of the continent itself, a sense of its own overarching climatological history. Once, Antarctica served mainly to measure the extremity of personal heroism. It was a backdrop for unparalleled physical exertion and, often, suffering.</p>
        <p>But the news of such a dramatic change in the topography of the Antarctic ice is a reminder that now the continent implicates all of us, and vice versa, in ways that would once have seemed unimaginable. Few of us can really imagine what the collapse of this small fraction of the Antarctic ice sheet must have been like. But it feels, somehow, as though it has broken apart from the way things have always been, and that is a worrying thought.</p>
