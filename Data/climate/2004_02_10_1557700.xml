        <p>Perhaps the most frightening symptom one can experience is being unable to inhale enough air to perform even the simplest activities, like walking from the bedroom to the bathroom or even talking. But that is the ultimate fate of millions of Americans with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p>
        <p>The ailment -- which encompasses chronic bronchitis, emphysema and some forms of asthma -- is now the fourth leading cause of death of Americans and the only major one that is on a seemingly relentless increase. Unless something is done to stem or reverse the trend, health experts predict, it will become the nation's and the world's third leading cause of death by 2020. In the United States, the costs now exceed $32 billion a year.</p>
        <p>An Insidious Disease</p>
        <p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a progressive, irreversible decline in lung function that afflicts 35 million Americans, gradually robbing them of the ability to take in oxygen and remove carbon dioxide from their blood. Nearly half the people with the disease do not yet know it. Although the disorder cannot be cured, if it is diagnosed early enough and properly treated, deterioration in lung function can be slowed. Even in advanced cases, proper treatment can restore some semblance of a normal life.</p>
        <p>Physicians and their patients are to blame for failing to diagnose the disease before it becomes crippling. It can be detected with a simple, noninvasive breathing test that takes just a few minutes to perform. But relatively few people at risk are tested before their symptoms become so advanced that they are impossible to ignore.</p>
        <p>Typical patients whose disorders have not been diagnosed are so used to coughing and bringing up phlegm that it seems natural. If they become winded climbing a flight of stairs or rushing for a bus, they tend to blame their weight, or advancing age. They may not think to mention such symptoms to a doctor unless they are asked directly. Even when doctors are aware of the symptoms, they may not realize their significance.</p>
        <p>For years, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was considered an ailment of old men, especially those who had worked in heavily polluted environments for decades. The picture today is drastically different. In his recent book, ''Life and Breath'' (Broadway Books), Dr. Neil Schachter, pulmonologist at the Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, reports, ''My C.O.P.D. patients include dancers, ambassadors, writers, teachers and reporters.'' The disease, he said, is ''an equal-opportunity killer.''</p>
        <p>The typical patient now is younger -- 45 to 64. And since 1992, the incidence has doubled in women, who represent nearly half the cases. In 2000, for the first time, the disease killed more women than men.</p>
        <p>How did this happen? You guessed it: cigarette smoking accounts for 80 to 90 percent of cases in this and other developed countries. Years of repeated exposure to the irritants in tobacco smoke have permanently damaged the bronchial tubes and air sacs of countless millions, rendering them unable to exchange normal amounts of oxygen and carbon dioxide with each breath.</p>
        <p>In some countries, the rise in the disease can be attributed to the growing numbers of cigarette smokers combined with chronic exposure to toxic air pollutants at work or at home, or both. The severity of the disease varies greatly, but a recent survey of patients revealed that many are so short of breath that they can barely perform basic daily activities. Nearly half of those surveyed became short of breath while washing, dressing or doing light housework. One in three said they became short of breath while talking, and more than one-quarter said they had difficulty breathing even when sitting or lying down.</p>
        <p>In an article in The Journal of the American Medical Association in November, a 62-year-old woman spoke of her own advanced case. She began experiencing shortness of breath in her 40's, when she was a heavy smoker, and she has had many hospital stays as her disease worsened.</p>
        <p>''I get short of breath very easy,'' she said. ''It bothered me, of course, but I didn't want to think that it was smoking. When you can't breathe, it's a horrible feeling. Now I have to really gasp for breath. I get tightness all over my chest, I can't walk. I'm lucky if I can take two steps. I miss the grandchildren. It's half a life. I don't even know if you could call it that.''</p>
        <p>Diagnosis and Treatment</p>
        <p>Anyone with a chronic cough that causes mucus, shortness of breath or tightness in the chest should be tested for C.O.P.D. So should everyone who has been a longtime smoker or chronically exposed to secondhand smoke. Some people have an inborn deficiency of the enzyme alpha-1 antitrypsin that renders them especially susceptible to emphysema, even if they do not smoke.</p>
        <p>The initial screening is a pulmonary function test: breathing deeply, then exhaling hard into a spirometer, which measures how much air the lungs can take in and how fast they can expel it. While in normal breathing, some air is always left in the air sacs of the lungs, the amount left can be 200 times as great in people with this disease.</p>
        <p>If the spirometry results are abnormal, follow-up tests may include chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, C.T. scan, exercise stress test and analysis of sputum and blood gases.</p>
        <p>Treatment starts with eliminating exposure to the cause. For most, that means throwing away the cigarettes once and for all.</p>
        <p>''Quitting smoking not only significantly improves airflow, but also prevents the progressive loss of lung function and reduces symptoms,'' Dr. Bartolome R. Celli of Tufts University said in the journal report.</p>
        <p>Because people with the disease are at much greater risk from bacterial pneumonia, they should also be vaccinated for influenza every year and for pneumococcus pneumonia every five years.</p>
        <p>Drug therapy to reduce or end symptoms, increase physical stamina and reduce the incidence and severity of flare-ups typically involves the use of inhaled bronchodilators to relax bronchial muscles and improve the ability to expel air.</p>
        <p>Several effective drugs are already available. A new one just approved by the Food and Drug Administration, tiotropium, or Spiriva HandiHaler, has been found in studies to be even more effective in providing long-term breathing help, reducing breathlessness and decreasing occurrences, Dr. Celli reported.</p>
        <p>When bronchodilation is not enough to control symptoms or when flare-ups occur, corticosteroids -- some inhaled and some oral -- may be needed to reduce inflammation in the airways.</p>
        <p>A crucial but sometimes neglected aspect of therapy involves pulmonary rehabilitation. In her book ''Coping With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease'' (St. Martin's Griffin), Elaine Fantle Shimberg describes ''an individualized, multidisciplinary program combining education, exercise, relaxation and breathing-retraining techniques, physical therapy, nutritional advice, emotional support and the development of coping and support skills to help with lifestyle changes.''</p>
        <p>The goal is to promote a life as free of symptoms and as full and independent as possible.</p>
