        <p>The state has decided to enact the acid rain rules that a New York judge threw out in May, arguing that further delay would endanger public health and the state's natural resources, Erin M. Crotty, left, commissioner of the state's Department of Environmental Conservation, announced yesterday. The rules, which seek to reduce emissions of nitrogen and sulfur, had been opposed by several energy companies. A State Supreme Court judge invalidated the rules on a technicality but upheld the department's authority to adopt such stringent regulations. The department has appealed the judge's decision. Ms. Crotty said in an interview that she was hopeful that the energy companies that brought the suit would not challenge the emergency regulations. A spokeswoman for NRG Energy, one of the companies, said officials were still reviewing the announcement and had not decided how they would respond.</p>
