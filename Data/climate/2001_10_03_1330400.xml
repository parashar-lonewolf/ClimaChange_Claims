        <p>Sealing his standing as America's most passionate and steadfast ally in the fight against terrorism, Prime Minister Tony Blair declared today that Osama bin Laden was responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks and challenged the Taliban leaders in Afghanistan to give him up or ''face the consequences.''</p>
        <p>''I say to the Taliban: surrender the terrorists, or surrender power,'' said a stern Mr. Blair, addressing a noisily supportive crowd at the Labor Party's annual conference in this seaside town.</p>
        <p>''In any action,'' he said, ''the aim will be to eliminate their military hardware, cut off their finances, disrupt their supplies, target their troops, not civilians. We will put a trap around the regime.''</p>
        <p>The prime minister's speech seemed intended as much to herald the beginning of a new world order -- with Mr. Blair somewhere close to its helm -- as it did to address Britons' concerns about their country's role in any forthcoming conflict.</p>
        <p>Adopting the sweeping style of an international statesman, Mr. Blair spoke of filling the void left by the attacks in the United States through ''the moral power of a world acting as a community.''</p>
        <p>''This is a moment to seize,'' he said. ''The kaleidoscope has been shaken. The pieces are in flux. Soon they will settle again. Before they do, let us re-order this world around us.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair did not set out how or when Britain -- and any other country that ultimately joins the United States in military action -- planned to attack the Taliban.</p>
        <p>But his remarks were the most forceful expression yet of his country's commitment to taking the initiative in the efforts to rout Mr. bin Laden and his terrorist networks.</p>
        <p>''Be in no doubt: bin Laden and his people organized this atrocity,'' the prime minister said. ''The Taliban aid and abet him.''</p>
        <p>An aide to the prime minister said he had written much of the speech by himself last week. But he and his staff have been in close contact with their American counterparts, the aide said, and it is clear that Mr. Blair's stark, unequivocal language about the approaching conflict had Washington's support.</p>
        <p>As during NATO's war with Yugoslavia over Kosovo in 1999, Mr. Blair has placed himself firmly at the forefront of what he casts as an alliance opposing tyranny.</p>
        <p>''This is a battle with only one outcome: our victory, not theirs,'' Mr. Blair said. ''The action that we take will be proportionate, targeted; we will do all we humanly can to avoid civilian tragedies. But understand what we are dealing with. Listen to the calls of those passengers on the planes. Think of the children on them, told they were going to die.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair, who was re-elected to a second term with a huge majority in June, did not explicitly say that his government was committed to toppling the Taliban leadership, but he did imply it.</p>
        <p>Addressing the Afghan people, he said: ''If the Taliban regime changes, we will work with you to make sure its successor is one that is broad-based, that unites all ethnic groups, and that offers some way out of the miserable poverty that is your present existence.''</p>
        <p>The underlying theme of Mr. Blair's speech was that the attack on the United States was tantamount to an attack on the world.</p>
        <p>The concerted effort to combat terrorism, he said, should be matched by an effort to reach greater consensus on a host of issues: fighting poverty, particularly in war-ravaged areas like Afghanistan; investing in Africa -- which he called ''a scar on the conscience of the world'' -- and helping ''breathe new life'' into the Middle East peace process.</p>
        <p>Diverging from the Bush administration position, Mr. Blair also praised the Kyoto agreement on climate change and said other countries should adhere to it. ''Kyoto is right,'' he said. ''We will implement it, and call on other nations to do so.''</p>
        <p>Labor Party conferences can be fraught affairs, with critics in the party -- and Mr. Blair's domestic program has many critics -- attacking their leaders at every turn. But Mr. Blair has a reputation for rising to the occasion during foreign crises, and the mood today was almost universally respectful.</p>
        <p>Capitalizing on this climate of muted deference, Mr. Blair took the opportunity to make the case for various pieces of his domestic program, including spending more money on infrastructure and encouraging greater private investment in public services.</p>
        <p>Despite the economic downturn, he said, the government would stick to its spending plans, investing rather than cutting taxes. ''For decades, there has been chronic under-investment in British public services,'' Mr. Blair said. ''Our historic mission is to put that right.''</p>
        <p>The prime minister reiterated his conditional support for a single European currency, stating the unpopular position that if the necessary economic conditions were met, then Britain should join.</p>
        <p>He also gently introduced the idea that the Labor government would call a national referendum on the euro.</p>
        <p>Then he returned to his global theme, calling for the world to assert its ''moral power'' as a community.</p>
        <p>''For those people who lost their lives on Sept. 11 and those that mourn them: now is the time for the strength to build that community,'' Mr. Blair said. ''Let that be their memorial.''</p>
