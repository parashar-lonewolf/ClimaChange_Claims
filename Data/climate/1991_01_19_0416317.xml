        <p>A Boston restaurateur and two other inventors obtained a patent this week on an aerosol canister for wine bottles that makes it possible to drink part of the bottle and preserve the rest for as long as wanted.</p>
        <p>The canister was conceived by Chuck Ellis, director of marketing at Boston's Grill 23 and Bar. Mr. Ellis said he had not been able to preserve wine for more than three weeks. As a result, he said, it was virtually impossible to sell expensive wines by the glass because the remaining wine might not be consumed before its taste and bouquet degraded. Similarly, wine collectors cannot sample a vintage and return the bottle to their collection.</p>
        <p>The new device allows a person to pour wine without removing the cork or letting air into the bottle. It consists of a canister filled with a special gas, designed to take the place of liquid leaving the bottle. The gas consists of argon, which does not mix with anything, and a mixture of carbon dioxide and water vapor that matches the natural percentages in wine.</p>
        <p>Protruding from the center of the canister is a hollow tube with a screw-tip that penetrates the cork. By pulling a handle on the canister's side, Mr. Ellis said, the hollow tip opens up and wine can pour through it. At the same time, he said, the aerosol canister pushes the replacement gas into the bottle through a second tube. As a result, outside air has no way of getting into the container. Mr. Ellis said the device made it possible to preserve a wine indefinitely.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ellis, Michael Osean, and Nori Hirako received patent 4,984,711.</p>
