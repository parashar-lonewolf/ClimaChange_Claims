        <p>LEAD: SOMEWHERE the hills may be alive with the sound of music, but at Theater Three they are barely humming.</p>
        <p>SOMEWHERE the hills may be alive with the sound of music, but at Theater Three they are barely humming.</p>
        <p>''The Sound of Music,'' the last collaboration between the great musical theater artists Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein, is a musical version of Maria Augusta Trapp's book, ''The Trapp Family Singers.'' The story, set in Austria during the tense pre-World War II year of 1938, concerns itself with how Maria Rainer, a young postulant at Nonnberg Abbey, becomes governess to Baron Von Trapp's seven children. She teaches the children to sing, she and the baron fall in love, and all nine of them escape from the Germans.</p>
        <p>It is a cloyingly sweet story, but the score contains a nonstop series of memorable songs, including ''Climb Every Mountain,'' ''The Sound of Music,'' ''Sixteen Going on Seventeen'' and ''Edelweiss.'' Fortunately, Theater Three's strength lies in the quality of its singers and musicians, and it is in this one area only that this production of ''The Sound of Music'' excels. Under Ellen Michelmore's outstanding musical direction, the small six-member orchestra packs a tuneful wallop and does credit to Richard Rodgers's now-classic score.</p>
        <p>The cast, floundering through Eric Paeper's inept direction, still manages to deliver the songs with style. JoLee Thayer, who alternates with Carolyn Droscoski in the role of the Mother Abbess, has a full, rich voice. She delivers the soaring ''Climb Every Mountain'' with graceful vocal ease.</p>
        <p>The star of the show is, without any question, Mary O'Neill, whose Maria is as fresh and lovely as mountain edelweiss. ''The Sound of Music'' is Maria's story, and Miss O'Neill tells it as her own. She is in total control of the stage and of her character, and she radiates all the charm of a Mary Martin or Julie Andrews.</p>
        <p>Robert C. Wheeler is polished brass as the rigid captain, George Von Trapp, who falls in love with Maria and her music. But it is the children who ultimately steal the show, as each one appears more precious than the next. The children are double-cast to ease the strain of rehearsals and performances, and undoubtedly the white group is as delightful as the red (which is how the program differentiates the two groups), who performed the night I saw the show.</p>
        <p>The fundamental problem with this production is that a musical demands more than actors who sing on key. The elements of sets, lights, costumes, choreography, stage management and direction are all contributing factors to a successful theatrical event, and it is in these areas that Theater Three's ''Sound of Music'' fades to inaudibility.</p>
        <p>The theater's management has requested that the press not attend opening nights, because of the likelihood the show will not be ready for reviewers. However, the theater's publicity does not alert the ticket-buying audience that the theater considers the first week of performances previews in which to work out technical problems. And ticket prices remain the same throughout the run.</p>
        <p>On opening night, there were in fact a series of unfortunate technical mistakes that were of no particular consequence. What is wrong with the show is so pervasive that six weeks of previews would not solve the problems.</p>
        <p>For example, the set, designed by Matthew Moore, disregards basic elements of stage design. It presents us with a cumbersome movable unit that resembles nothing so much as a stiff slab of dried-out smoked salmon, both in color and texture, and the painted trees look like victims of acid rain. Rachael Bickel's lighting design bathes the stage in shadow.</p>
        <p>Further, there is an obvious inattention to details, such as wrinkles in the backdrop curtain, unpressed costumes, a stage floor so dirty that an actor's footprints are clearly visible from the audience. These things speak of a theater's attitude toward a production. Without question, a show that is ready for an audience is ready for the press to review it. If it is not, it should postpone its opening.</p>
        <p>''The Sound of Music'' will continue at Theater Three in Port Jefferson through Jan. 2. Perhaps by Christmas, production elements will have risen to meet the quality of the actors.</p>
