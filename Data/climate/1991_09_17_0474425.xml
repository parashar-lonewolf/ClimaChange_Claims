        <p>FOR half a century the wizards of military rocketry have vied to build bigger, better and more deadly missiles armed with warheads of terrifying power. Now they are racing to find innovative ways to tear the missiles apart or divert them to other uses.</p>
        <p>The sprawling new enterprise of destruction and conversion has been born of East-West arms control and police actions undertaken by the United Nations in Iraq. All told, it involves thousands of missiles. The scope and complexity of the job are challenging the creativity of scientists, engineers and government officials around the world.  The Wake of the Coup</p>
        <p>Moreover, the recent failure of the Kremlin coup and the subsequent purge of Soviet hard-liners has increased calls around the world for a redoubling in the pace of nuclear disarmament, which, if realized, would swell the ranks of discarded armaments.</p>
        <p>In essence, missiles are big tubes filled with exotic alloys, toxic chemicals and explosive fuels. They can blow up if they get too old or if they are roughly handled. They can create a nightmare of noxious fumes if burned on the ground.</p>
        <p>They could be converted for use in launching satellites into space, but the process is costly and tricky. Also, they could then threaten private industry with unfair competition and produce exhaust fumes that might damage the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>All aspects of the retirement process are now under intense scrutiny, by both private and government experts. One aim is to make the conversion of missiles as inexpensive and non-threatening as possible. Another is to make missile destruction safer and more environmentally benign, in response to both public protests over missile burning and tough new environmental laws and regulations.</p>
        <p>"There are a lot of people scratching their heads, trying to think up innovative technologies," said Dr. Cheryl K. Rofer, a researcher at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. She heads an effort to develop an innocuous way of destroying solid-rocket fuel, which when burned can create clouds of hydrochloric acid and other hazardous chemicals.</p>
        <p>The new age of missile deactivation began with the 1987 signing of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Force treaty, under which the United States eliminated 846 short-range missiles and the Soviet Union destroyed 1,846. It picked up this year when the United Nations went into Iraq to oversee the ruination of Saddam Hussein's missile arsenal, the dimensions of which are currently unknown. In the near future, it is to likely to expand greatly to include the destruction or conversion of 2,000 or so long-range missiles under the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as Start, signed in late July by President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.  Crude Methods Criticized</p>
        <p>The I.N.F. treaty, which pioneered the whole process, also generated strong criticism over its relatively crude methods. For the United States, the easiest and most benign job was taking apart the 21-foot-long ground-launched cruise missiles, which were cut longitudinally by huge saws. Wings and tail sections were severed and the missile's front section, containing guidance equipment, was crushed. Liquid fuel was removed and recycled.</p>
        <p>The dirtiest job turned out to be disposing of the Pershing missiles, which were 35 feet long and filled with the standard type of solid fuel, made up of a dense, rubbery binder containing up to 20 percent aluminum particles. A decision was made to fire the engines on the ground, even though their exhaust contained aluminum oxide, titanium dioxide, hydrochloric acid and asbestos. After a test firing in Utah, local opposition swelled as missile exhaust blew across the desert into Salt Lake City.</p>
        <p>"The smoke probably added to the pollution already in the valley and may have contributed" to reports of respiratory problems, Burnell Cordner, the director of Utah's Bureau of Air Quality, told state officials.</p>
        <p>The thunder of Pershing destruction was centered in Colorado and Texas, and eventually just Karnack, Tex., as protests erupted in Colorado. Even then, the weather had to be just right to avoid an inversion layer that would concentrate clouds of pollutants near the ground.  The Possibilities of Oxidation</p>
        <p>"We have safely, and with appropriate environmental safeguards, eliminated all the rocket motors," Lieut. Col. Jeffrey Russell, commander of the Army ammunition plant in Karnack, announced in May after the last firing took place.</p>
        <p>Public protests and passage of new environmental laws have helped spur a surge of new military research on benign ways to dispose of missiles, and, especially, solid-rocket fuel. "We consider open burning to be hazardous and unnecessary," said Lenny Siegel, the chief researcher of the Military Toxics Project of the National Toxics Campaign Fund, based in Boston, a private group that helped lead the protests.</p>
        <p>At Los Alamos, researchers are studying a novel pressure cooker that heats and destroys solid-rocket fuel in a cloud of dense steam. The process is based on oxidation, in which oxygen reacts with other materials. Oxidation happens slowly in the human body and very quickly in a fire or explosion. The Los Alamos process seeks a middle ground.</p>
        <p>To date, a prototype apparatus has processed only minuscule amounts of material, on the order of a gallon an hour. But it is seen as holding promise for large-scale application.</p>
        <p>"Can we put these sensitive compounds in the reactor and not have them blow up?" asked Dr. Rofer of Los Alamos. "The answer so far seems to be yes."</p>
        <p>The Los Alamos research is financed in part by the Air Force, which has responsibility for the nation's long-range offensive missiles and is exploring a variety of innovative ways to recycle or destroy them. The work is centered at the Air Force Civil Engineering Support Agency, at Tyndall Air Force Base in Panama City, Fla.</p>
        <p>"We think it can have economic and environmental benefits," said Dr. Joseph D. Wander, a fuels chemist at the facility.  Police Action in Iraq</p>
        <p>One aim of the program is to investigate new ways to remove rubbery solid fuel from metal casings, the traditional method being a high-pressure stream of cool water, which is slow and inefficient. In one study, super-cold liquid nitrogen is being applied to the fuel, quickly reducing it to a powder that can be processed or recycled. In another, a high-pressure stream of very hot water is played over the surface, rapidly dissolving the fuel. This technique, however, cannot be used on solid fuel that contains nitroglycerine (often used to give an added kick to upper-stage engines) lest it explode.</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, the Air Force is even investigating whether special breeds of anaerobic microorganisms, which need no air, can digest some dilute components of rocket fuel. "They convert it to a simple salt," said Dr. Wander. "That process is close to being ready to go."</p>
        <p>Not all missile destruction is so sophisticated. In Iraq this year, after the Gulf war, the United Nations began a sweeping police action to destroy all weapons of mass destruction, including any Iraqi missiles with a range of more than 93 miles. Iraq presented 62 missiles for destruction, most of them Scuds fueled by kerosene and red fuming nitric acid. Experts suspect there may be dozens or even hundreds of other Scuds still undisclosed.</p>
        <p>Between June 30 and July 7, United Nations personnel presided over the destruction of the missiles and their support equipment, including warheads and fuel trucks. The main technique was pulverization with a heavy weight.</p>
        <p>"It was a bulldozer with a big steel bucket on the end," said Col. Douglas M. Englund of the United States Army who is executive director for operations of the United Nations Special Commission operating in Iraq. "They came in and pulverized the aft end, with the motor, and the front end, with the guidance system. It turns out to be a fairly difficult job."</p>
        <p>In the near future, the pace of world-wide missile retirement is to pick up under the Start treaty, which the Soviets, despite the current political turmoil, have pledged to carry out. Its terms require the destruction of missile silos, submarines and bombers, but spare missiles, can, under strict guidelines, be reused for other purposes. The question now getting high-level attention in Washington is what to do with the 800 to 1,000 American missiles that will be retired, mainly aging Minuteman 2's and Poseidon C-3's.</p>
        <p>Some will be kept for military research and the Pentagon's anti-missile program, officials say. But since Start places limits on how much data can be encrypted during test flights, the Defense Department is unlikely to use the boosters for operations that are considered sensitive.</p>
        <p>A vigorous debate is now heating up over whether many of the missiles should be converted into civil and commercial launchers that would be able to loft small payloads into space. Experts such as Dr. Paul J. Coleman Jr., the president of the Universities Space Research Association, say this would be a boon for scientific research. But others fear that a sudden wave of small launchers would be a competitive blow to the nation's fledgling commercial launching industry, which is struggling to survive.</p>
        <p>"It sounds good to convert swords into plowshares," said David W. Thompson, the president of the Orbital Sciences Corporation, a small-rocket maker based in Fairfax, Va. "But we think the plows will be fairly expensive and not very good performers." The ultimate fear of his industry, he added, was that "the Government will inadvertently compete with the private sector."</p>
        <p>Douglas R. Graham, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for space, recently echoed that concern in testimony to the House space subcommittee. "Without adequate controls," he said, "dumping of government developed 'excess assets' could have devastating effects."</p>
        <p>Environmental groups are also leery of a surge in small rockets, fearing an increasing rate of damage to the earth's ozone layer. Experts are divided on the extent of the danger.</p>
        <p>In the end, some experts believe many of the missiles covered by the Start treaty will end up being destroyed or recycled, if only because of their age. The Minuteman 2 is nearly two decades old, and is considered by some experts too unreliable for use as a space launcher.</p>
        <p>"It's real embarrassing to have one blow up on you," said Dr. Wander of the Air Force Civil Engineering Support Agency. "When they get old, you get that kind of problem. It's a matter of how much of a gamble you want to take. I would think that, except for low-priority launches, the missiles will be used for their materials or will be destroyed."</p>
