        <p>'Scream' Damage May Be Beyond Repair</p>
        <p>Damage resulting from the theft of Edvard Munch's ''Scream'' may be too severe to be repaired, according to a 200-page assessment that was to be turned over yesterday to the police in Oslo, The Associated Press reported. ''The Scream'' and another Munch masterwork, ''Madonna,'' were recovered by the police in August, two years after they were stolen from the city-owned Munch Museum in Oslo by masked gunmen in a daylight robbery on Aug. 22, 2004. The police have refused to say how they recovered the paintings, or where they had been. Discussing ''The Scream,'' Ingebjorg Ydstie, a museum curator, told the TV-2 network: ''Water has been absorbed by one corner of the paperboard, and there is abrasion damage on the lower part of the painting. We have a large swath that is very visible.'' She said the museum was trying to determine whether the damage can be repaired. Anne Milnes, a restoration expert, said, ''There are types of damage we can't do anything about.'' A statement posted by the museum referred to the liquid that caused the damage when it said, ''When one has further knowledge of the chemical composition one will know whether the damage is going to be stable, or whether one may risk the development of further damage.''</p>
        <p>Parthenon Sculptures Face Removal</p>
        <p>Seven sculptures on the Parthenon will be removed and replaced by replicas to protect them from pollution, a Greek restoration expert said yesterday in Athens, The Associated Press reported. The sculptures, known as metopes, will be exhibited in the new Acropolis Museum, said Maria Ioannidou, director of the Acropolis restoration services. Carved into the band of Doric friezes below the Parthenon roof and above its columns, they are among the temple's few remaining original sculptures. Ms. Ioannidou said Greek archeologists had decided to remove them to ''save the metopes, threatened by acid rain caused by atmospheric pollution and natural erosion.'' The project should be completed by 2008.</p>
        <p>Philharmonic Broadcasts to Europe</p>
        <p>The New York Philharmonic yesterday announced an agreement with BBC Radio 3 and the European Broadcasting Union to feature 10 Philharmonic concerts a year on radio stations throughout Europe. The Philharmonic said the arrangement would make it the first American symphony orchestra to have a regular presence on European radio, and would carry its music to three million to seven million listeners. The concerts, chosen from the 2006-7 season, will be produced and distributed by BBC Radio 3 beginning early next year.</p>
        <p>Harry Potter: Dreams and a Title</p>
        <p>The latest news from the world of wizards and sorcery includes the title of the next (and final) Harry Potter adventure as well as an excursion into the dream life of J. K. Rowling, below, chronicler of his angst and exploits. The BBC reported that fans who played a game on Ms. Rowling's Web site, www.jkrowling.com, learned that the seventh and final volume would be titled ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.'' Ms. Rowling also disclosed that for the first time she has begun to dream she is in Harry's world. ''Perhaps I should cut back on the caffeine?'' she wondered. Reporting that she is hard at work on the final volume, she wrote: ''I am alternately elated and overwrought. I both want and don't want to finish this book (don't worry, I will).''</p>
        <p>Veteran Loses Michael Moore Suit</p>
        <p>A federal judge in Boston has dismissed a lawsuit brought against the filmmaker Michael Moore by an Iraq war veteran who contended that his image had been used without his permission in Mr. Moore's antiwar documentary ''Fahrenheit 9/11,'' Reuters reported. The veteran, Sgt. Peter Damon, had sought $35 million from Mr. Moore; Miramax, owned by the Walt Disney Company; and several other film concerns. The movie showed the sergeant, who had lost his right arm near the shoulder and much of his left arm, speaking from a gurney at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and saying that he feels pain but that painkillers given to him ''take a lot of the edge'' off it. The clip, originally used by ''NBC Nightly News'' for a report on medical treatment for veterans, appeared in Mr. Moore's film after a statement by Representative Jim McDermott, a Democrat of Washington State, that ''they're leaving all kinds of veterans behind.''</p>
