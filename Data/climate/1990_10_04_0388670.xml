        <p>LEAD: INSULATION is so useful in reducing household fuel costs, minimizing drafts and keeping room temperatures uniform that it is worth inspecting every year or two to make sure it is still in good shape.</p>
        <p>INSULATION is so useful in reducing household fuel costs, minimizing drafts and keeping room temperatures uniform that it is worth inspecting every year or two to make sure it is still in good shape.</p>
        <p>Some insulation is inaccessible to all but professional contractors - insulation behind walls, for example. But insulation in the attic and basement is usually in plain sight. Inspect it to see if it has been properly installed, and whether it is displaced or damaged.</p>
        <p>Attic insulation is usually installed in the bays between the floor joists. All bays should be filled to capacity, and insulation should cover the door or panel over the attic entrance.</p>
        <p>The most common insulation comes in fiberglass strips called batts, with paper or foil facing on one side. On attic floors, the facing needs to lie against the ceiling of the living areas below, serving as a vapor barrier against moisture that rises with the warm air. Without such a barrier, the moisture can get into the insulation and condense, causing water damage.</p>
        <p>On the ceiling and end walls of the attic, the facing should be on the outside, to block moisture rising from the house. In other words, the facing should be visible on the attic ceiling and walls, invisible on the floor.</p>
        <p>Because the facing is impregnated with asphalt, it is flammable, and many fire codes limit its exposure. Make sure that insulation comes no closer than three inches to metal chimneys, stovepipes and heat-producing fixtures like doorbell transformers and recessed lights.</p>
        <p>Lights marked I.C., for insulated ceiling, can be safely touched by or covered with insulation. And if the insulation is unfaced or if the facing is removed, it can safely come in contact with masonry chimneys.</p>
        <p>To prevent moisture problems, make sure that insulation extends to the edges of the ceiling but not beyond them into the areas above the soffits, the enclosed channels that run along a roof's eaves. The soffits must remain open so air can circulate through them, from the vents on their undersides to the vents in the gable ends or roof ridge. In winter, this prevents condensation on the underside of the roof that can cause rot and dampen insulation; in summer, it reduces the buildup of heat that can shorten the life of roofing materials.</p>
        <p>Extending insulation to the perimeter of the house is necessary both to conserve as much indoor air as possible and to help prevent ice dams, the ridges of ice that form along eaves in winter.</p>
        <p>Ice dams form when warm indoor air rising through an attic melts snow on the sides of a roof. As the meltwater runs down the slope, it freezes again when it reaches the roof's overhanging edges, which are not heated from below.</p>
        <p>Water accumulating behind ice dams can seep beneath shingles, causing roof leaks and rot. The best way to keep all this from happening is to make sure insulation is scrupulously installed above the entire heated area of a house.</p>
        <p>To keep insulation away from soffits and from hot spots like chimneys and lighting fixtures, you can buy barriers of stiff material that fit between joists, or you can make your own barriers from heavy cardboard. Fold the ends of the barriers so they fit against the sides of the joists; attach them to the joists with staples or small nails.</p>
        <p>If insulation is fastened between rafters, make sure none has come loose. Refasten any hanging strips by stapling them to the rafters in the same way the rest of the insulation is fastened. To assure adequate ventilation, there must be a gap of about two inches between the insulation and the underside of the roof. The gap should extend from a vent along the roof ridge to the soffit.</p>
        <p>In basements, insulation is usually installed overhead, between the joists supporting the main floor. As in an attic, facing should be visible only if there is insulation on the walls.</p>
        <p>Overhead basement insulation may touch the underside of the subflooring. But a gap of up to three inches is useful, as long as it is closed at the ends: it creates a layer of dead air that also insulates.</p>
        <p>More important, though, is that all bays are filled and that insulation around obstacles like bridging (cross-braces), pipes and wiring be cut to accommodate them. If it is squeezed beneath them, its insulating capacity is diminished.</p>
        <p>Even if your insulation was properly installed and is in good shape, you may need more. Last year the Federal Department of Energy increased its recommended minimums for household insulation.</p>
        <p>Home centers carry rolls of unfaced fiberglass insulation; these are simply spread over the existing insulation, perpendicular to the joists so they cover all seams. When installing any fibrous or particulate insulation, wear a Government-approved dust mask rated for the job.</p>
        <p>You can get a free guide to adding more insulation by calling the Office of Conservation and Renewable Energy at (800) 523-2929. Ask for the Department of Energy Insulation Fact Sheet, publication FS142.</p>
