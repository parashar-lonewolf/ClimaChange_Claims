        <p>MOST air-conditioners in American cars are running on borrowed time because production of the refrigerant they use will soon be prohibited. The cost of repairing a car air-conditioner is already rising, and in a few years repairs will be almost impossible. So a driver with a broken unit will either have to buy an expensive new one that uses an ozone-friendly refrigerant or do without.</p>
        <p>That is true even for most 1993 models, and it will be for some 94's. But in the last few months people shopping for new cars have been presented with an increasing number of models using a refrigerant considered safe for the ozone layer. The list will undoubtedly get longer in the next few months.</p>
        <p>For those who aren't ready to buy a new car, but might be faced with replacing an old air-conditioner, there is no telling exactly what it will cost, though estimates run to $800.</p>
        <p>Production of the refrigerant used in car air-conditioners -- a chlorofluorocarbon known as R-12 and made under a variety of trade names, including Freon -- will be banned at the end of 1995, and severely curtailed until then, to protect the ozone layer. Most cars require a "top off" of R-12, or even a complete refill, every two or three years.</p>
        <p>"There are going to be tremendous shortages in 1994," said Simon Oulouhojian, the president of the Mobile Air-Conditioning Society, a trade association with headquarters in Upper Darby, Pa. The organization trains mechanics in how to use the equipment that captures the chlorofluorocarbon, or CFC, when an air-conditioner is opened for servicing. In the past, the gas just escaped into the air.</p>
        <p>Air-conditioning units running on a new refrigerant, R-134a, are now available. Manufacturers say that, aside from the design expense, the new units don't cost markedly more to build than the old R-12 units. Even so, consumers may find someday that cars with the new units command a higher price because -- as with any "hot" accessory, like airbags and antilock brakes -- car makers might charge what the traffic will bear.</p>
        <p>There are already more than 123.3 million passenger cars in America, and in recent years more than 90 percent of new cars have come with air-conditioning. But most car companies are not yet equipping a majority of their models with R-134a units.</p>
        <p>Explaining why, Pam Kueber, a spokeswoman for the Ford Motor Company, said, "It all happened very fast." The first international agreement to phase out CFC's, known as the Montreal Protocol, called for a 50 percent drop in production by the year 2000, which would have given Detroit plenty of time to switch to air-conditioners using ozone-friendly substitutes. But with the growing alarm among scientists about the global thinning of the ozone layer, which protects living things from harmful rays from the sun, the industrial countries agreed to a faster phase-out.</p>
        <p>The car companies minimize the issue, no doubt in part because they have lots full of cars that use R-12. Mr. Oulouhojian, asked if he would buy such a car, said: "You don't buy a car because it's environmentally good in one item. I'd be interested in comfort, styling, all these other things."</p>
        <p>Still, if a shopper looks under the hood of a car on a showroom floor, the air-conditioner may be the most important thing to ask about.</p>
        <p>Chlorofluorocarbons are used in all kinds of cooling systems, including those in refrigerators and freezers. But a refrigerator can run 30 years on a single charge. And many window air-conditioners and whole-house units already run on ozone-friendly substitutes or on hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC's), which are less damaging to the ozone and whose production will be allowed far longer than the equipment will last.</p>
        <p>In contrast, a car air-conditioner is virtually guaranteed to leak every few years. It has a shaft that draws power from the engine to run the compressor. The seal around the shaft, subjected to wear, tear and temperatures not present in a kitchen, usually fails after a few years.</p>
        <p>Before concern arose about the effect of CFC's on the ozone layer, no one considered a broken seal a big problem, because the refrigerant was so cheap: a full charge cost less than a quart of motor oil. But now, mobile air-conditioners are a focus of Government efforts to reduce CFC use.</p>
        <p>To pay for their new recovery equipment, and for the additional R-12, which is now heavily taxed, some service shops charge $60 for a refill.</p>
        <p>Anthony Mash, who is in charge of marketing R-134a at ICI Americas in Wilmington, Del., a leading producer of the refrigerant, offered a prediction: "You will get people running around car junkyards and sucking out three-quarters of a pound."</p>
        <p>Car owners with a little mechanical skill used to buy R-12 at auto-supply stores and refill their systems themselves. But in June, a new Federal rule halted the retail sale of the familiar one-pound cans. Now, only licensed technicians can buy containers of less than 20 pounds. Most cars use two to three pounds.</p>
        <p>Only the production of R-12 is prohibited -- not its use -- so as with pre-Castro Havana cigars, some stocks of vintage R-12 may still be around after production ceases, with a price keyed to the eagerness of the buyer. To discourage hoarding, the Government has increased taxes each year not only on new production, but also on inventories held by repair shops.</p>
        <p>R-134a has only recently become the consensus choice of the auto industry, after a speed-up of testing for flammability, toxicity and durability. The industry says R-134a will work just as well as R-12, but because its chemistry is different, it eats away hoses, seals and lubricants designed for R-12. It also operates at different pressures, so it cannot be used in existing air-conditioners. Some R-12 air-conditioners are now being built with some components that are compatible with R-134a, so that if the car is converted later, fewer parts will have to be switched.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mash, of ICI Americas, said that last year he had his two-year-old American car converted by technicians at his company and that he has had "no problems whatsoever."</p>
        <p>But how much trouble and expense will conversions cause the ordinary driver?</p>
        <p>"It could be as cheap as $200 or as high as $800," Mr. Oulouhojian said. "It's not just changing a light bulb. Every air-conditioning system is custom designed to that vehicle."</p>
        <p>He noted, for example, that Chevrolet Caprice and Cavalier both have General Motors air-conditioners, but not necessarily the same kind. And some systems will require more new parts than others, he said.</p>
        <p>"You may be lucky," Mr. Mash said. "You may not."</p>
        <p>Ms. Kueber said Ford had no estimate of the cost to convert a system. But of Mr. Oulouhojian's estimate, she said, "We're very aware that that kind of figure would alarm customers."</p>
        <p>"We will be there," she said, pledging that Ford would not abandon owners of cars with irreparable air-conditioners. "We will satisfy you, but I can't tell you now how." The changeover of Ford factories to R-134a will be "virtually 100 percent" by the 1995 models, she added.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Chrysler Corporation, Jason Vines, said 1992 and 1993 vehicles could probably be converted for $250 or so, but "for those systems older than 1992, it's obviously going to be more expensive." He added that Chrysler was considering splitting costs with customers or doing the work at cost on late-model cars, to create "happy customers."</p>
        <p>Mr. Vines said that of the two million cars Chrysler hopes to sell this year, about 750,000 will use R-134a, the rest R-12. By January 1994, all cars the company offers for sale will use R-134a, he said.</p>
