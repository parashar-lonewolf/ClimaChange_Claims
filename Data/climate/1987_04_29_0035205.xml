        <p>LEAD: The Supreme Court today upheld a law classifying as ''political propaganda'' all foreign government films that might influence public opinion on United States foreign policies.</p>

        <p>LEAD: The Supreme Court today upheld a law classifying as ''political propaganda'' all foreign government films that might influence public opinion on United States foreign policies.</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court today upheld a law classifying as ''political propaganda'' all foreign government films that might influence public opinion on United States foreign policies.</p>
        <p>The Court, 5 to 3, rejected a suit by a California state senator who said that application of that phrase to three Canadian films violated his right to free speech by implying government disapproval. He wanted to show the films, which concern nuclear war and acid rain, to constituents.</p>
        <p>A heated dispute arose in 1983 when the Justice Department enforced a 45-year-old provision of the Foreign Agents Registration Act against the three films. The law does not bar their presentation, but State Senator Barry Keene said the Government's classification had deterred him from using them because voters would be suspicious of a candidate who showed films officially classified as propaganda. Congressional Definition Is Key</p>
        <p>Justice John Paul Stevens, however, writing for the Court majority, said that ''political propaganda,'' as defined by Congress, ''has no pejorative connotation.''</p>
        <p>He stressed ''the respect we normally owe to the Legislature's power to define the terms that it uses in legislation,'' although he noted the ''potential misunderstanding'' that could arise from the widespread popular assumption that the word means ''a form of slanted, misleading speech that does not merit serious attention.''</p>
        <p>His opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White, Lewis F. Powell Jr. and Sandra Day O'Connor. Justice Harry A. Blackmun dissented, joined by William J. Brennan Jr. and Thurgood Marshall.</p>
        <p>Justice Antonin Scalia, who ruled in a related case before his appointment to the Court, did not take part in today's decision, which overturned what the majority termed an ''untenable'' ruling by Federal District Judge Raul A. Ramirez of Sacramento barring the Justice Department from enforcing the law against the three films. Little Real Impact</p>
        <p>The decision will have very little practical effect, both because it upheld the law rather than striking it down and because the Court's rationale was quite narrow. But some critics of the law warned that the ruling could set a precedent for governmental disparagement and stigmatizing of views with which the Government disagrees.</p>
        <p>Justice Stevens, in holding that the law placed ''no burden on protected expression,'' acknowledged that some people might suspect a film that must be registered with the Justice Department. But ''there is no evidence that this suspicion - to the degree it exists - has had the effect of Government censorship,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Justice Blackmun said in dissent, however, that the history of the law showed that Congress was primarily concerned about ''subversive propaganda'' and ''fully intended to discourage communications by foreign agents.'' He said that such ''governmental disparagement'' of speech violated the First Amendment.</p>
        <p>Justice Blackmun said the majority held ''an unjustifiably narrow view of the sort of government action that can violate First Amendment protections,'' which he said ''extend beyond the blatant censorship the Court finds lacking here.'' As to the definition of the phrase in question, he said, ''It simply strains credulity for the Court to assert that 'propaganda' is a neutral classification.'' Law Dates to 1938</p>
        <p>The Justice Department was severely criticized and accused of a form of censorship in 1983 by civil libertarians, Canadian officials, environmentalists and others for requiring that the three films be registered and labeled in accordance with provisions of the Foreign Agents Registration Act.</p>
        <p>There was no dispute between the majority and the dissenters today that the films, distributed by the National Film Board of Canada, a registered foreign agent, fit the broad statutory definition of ''political propaganda.'' The issue was whether the statute was unconstitutional as applied to them.</p>
        <p>The 1938 law, as amended in 1942, broadly defines as ''political propaganda'' all materials disseminated by agents of foreign governments that might be used to influence United States foreign policy, regardless of the nature of the materials or the foreign government.</p>
        <p>It requires that copies of such materials be filed with the Justice Department, together with descriptions of their dissemination. Foreign agents must also place labels on the materials disclosing that they are registered foreign agent materials and that ''registration does not indicate approval of the contents of this material by the United States Government.'' Neutral Definition Cited</p>
        <p>Justice Stevens noted that the required labels need not include the words ''political propaganda.'' The Justice Department had said that people other than foreign agents who wanted to exhibit the films, like Mr. Keene, were free to remove the labels.</p>
        <p>The opinion said that ''Congress simply required the disseminators of such material to make additional disclosures that would better enable the public to evaluate the import of the propaganda.''</p>
        <p>The statutory definition ''includes advocacy materials that are completely accurate and merit the closest attention and the highest respect,'' Justice Stevens noted.</p>
        <p>The three Canadian films at issue today were ''If You Love This Planet,'' dealing with effects of nuclear war, which won the Academy Award as the best foreign documentary in 1983; ''Acid Rain: Requiem or Recovery,'' and ''Acid From Heaven.''</p>
        <p>Terry Eastland, the top Justice Department spokesman, said the Court's decision, Meese v. Keene, No. 85-1180, provided ''a measure of vindication'' and confirmed the Administration's view that critics had been ''tendentious'' and unfair. ''This was a law duly passed by Congress and we had an obligation to enforce it, notwithstanding some doubts we had about its wisdom, but not its constitutionality,'' he said. Seeking Change in Congress</p>
        <p>Morton Halperin, head of the American Civil Liberties Union's Washington office, said today: ''We regret the decision. We think it was wrong, but we think it was relatively narrowly decided and therefore not likely to do much harm.''</p>
        <p>He said he would press Congress to rewrite the law and use more neutral terminology, such as ''advocacy material,'' to classify foreign government materials subject to registration. The Administration has previously said it would support such an amendment, Mr. Eastland noted.</p>
        <p>John Buchanan, chairman of People for the American Way, said the Court's decision ''aimed a gratuitous slap at a friendly foreign government and at the intelligence of the American people.'' He added: ''Americans do not need or want their government to screen ideas for them, and free speech cannot tolerate such governmental screening.''</p>
        <p>$ ? ----  CANADIAN EXPRESSES REGRET</p>
        <p>TORONTO, April 28 (Special to The New York Times) - An official of the National Film Board expressed ''disappointment and regret'' today at the Supreme Court decision but said the board was confident that its reputation in the United States would survive the ruling.</p>
        <p>Mireille Kermoyan, communications director for the Government-financed film agency, said the board held to its view that the three films were ''strictly informative and educational, not propaganda in any sense.''</p>
        <p>''I think we can be assured that the American public is on our side,'' she added. ''After all, the concerns that these films raise, acid rain and nuclear war, are public concerns in the United States. They are simply descriptive, without any kind of editorial comment.''</p>
