        <p>IT has been a warm, dry spring in Colorado. As of June 6, the yellows and oranges that indicate abnormally dry to severe drought on the United States Drought Monitor map cover the entire state, and one bright red blossom of extreme drought was expanding out on the eastern plains. Denver has received only 1.73 inches of precipitation in the last three months. Nolan Duskin, from the Colorado Climate Center, knows that several major drought years can be part of a larger period of drought and he is discouraged by what he calls the rapid deterioration toward 2002 conditions.</p>
        <p>In 2002, the one-two-three punch of low snowfall, a warm windy spring and a hot dry summer led to one of the worst fire seasons in Colorado history, a serious decline in every sector of the $8.5 billion tourist industry and the disruption of tens of thousands of lives. The residents of my county watched in horror as two huge forest fires converged upon us, turning our skies black, the moon orange and our pastures to dust.</p>

        <p>IT has been a warm, dry spring in Colorado. As of June 6, the yellows and oranges that indicate abnormally dry to severe drought on the United States Drought Monitor map cover the entire state, and one bright red blossom of extreme drought was expanding out on the eastern plains. Denver has received only 1.73 inches of precipitation in the last three months. Nolan Duskin, from the Colorado Climate Center, knows that several major drought years can be part of a larger period of drought and he is discouraged by what he calls the rapid deterioration toward 2002 conditions.</p>
        <p>In 2002, the one-two-three punch of low snowfall, a warm windy spring and a hot dry summer led to one of the worst fire seasons in Colorado history, a serious decline in every sector of the $8.5 billion tourist industry and the disruption of tens of thousands of lives. The residents of my county watched in horror as two huge forest fires converged upon us, turning our skies black, the moon orange and our pastures to dust.</p>
        <p>In a drought year, however, no one in the state is hit faster and harder than the farmers and ranchers out on the eastern plains. In a system with almost no irrigation potential built in, the equation is simple: if the rain doesn't come, the grass doesn't grow, and if the grass doesn't grow, there is no way to feed the cattle.</p>
        <p>Mark Frasier, who runs 3,400 head of beef cattle yearlings and 400 head of fall-calving cows on a ranch near Woodrow, is trying hard to stay optimistic. His commitment to the land is evident in the soft-spoken timbre of his voice, his grief for the spring rain that never came, his hope for summer thunderstorms and his faith that the pasture will be forgiving.</p>
        <p>Mr. Frasier employs holistic ranching techniques on his 29,000 acres of native range. The rolling hills of blue gamma and buffalo grass are maintained by rotating the stock almost constantly among 190 paddocks of grazing. That way, he says, ''the cattle recycle nutrients and organic matter back into the soil, which helps the ground retain moisture. The soil surface benefits from the disturbance caused by the hooves of the animals, even when the ground is dry. We can't say when we are going to get rain, but we can prepare ourselves so that our soil is receptive and the plants are healthy enough to respond when we do.''</p>
        <p>For the wheat farmers, though, who are completely dependent on early spring moisture, it is already too late. This year's winter wheat crop, which will be harvested in July, could amount to only 50 million bushels, half of the yearly average. And another year of losses is something that Colorado farmers, who lost more than $100 million in crop revenue in 2002, can't afford.</p>
        <p>Brad Udall, director of the Western Water Assessment at Colorado University at Boulder, is one of a growing number of scientists who fear that the news may be even worse than another major drought year in a longer drought period, and that the dry, cracked range land of the American Southwest is destined to become the next icon of global warming.</p>
        <p>A growing number of researchers agree that based on current emissions, there is an additional one degree Fahrenheit warming commitment embedded into our 100-year plan. In other words, all the carbon dioxide molecules we emit today are going to stay wrapped around the earth for 100 years and continue to warm it. Even if people found a way to radically reduce emissions, Mr. Udall says, it would be a long time ''before we could make the thermometer stop going up.''</p>
        <p>And that is bad news for Mr. Frasier and his neighbors, who know that once a couple of fires get started in the mountains, which Mr. Duskin says could happen any minute, all of the attention will turn away from agriculture to the resort towns and the suburbs, leaving the ranchers to weather the drought of 2006 alone.</p>
