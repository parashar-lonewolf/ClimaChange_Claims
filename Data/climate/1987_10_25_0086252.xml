        <p>LEAD: BROKERS hurling themselves from high windows. Men selling apples on street corners. Silent, shuffling breadlines and shouting crowds outside banks.

        <p>BROKERS hurling themselves from high windows. Men selling apples on street corners. Silent, shuffling breadlines and shouting crowds outside banks. Even for many of us who did not endure the Great Crash, images of the Depression still flicker across the years. Is that why so many people panicked?</p>
        <p>Yesterday my massage therapist, an educated and intelligent woman, told me she'd cashed in her I.R.A. funds on Monday. ''I don't know what got into me,'' she admitted ruefully. We puzzled together about it and then moved on to the Twins and the World Series. With both the market and the Series, we were not very optimistic. Perhaps we had been balefully influenced by history. How many road games had the Twins won this year? Not many. What does history tell us about the stock market? Eventually, it comes down.</p>
        <p>Perhaps this week's panic also drew on a deeper historical fear. No country remains powerful forever. Is our turn over? Many pundits warn usthat it may be. They also predict a global warming trend, a California earthquake, depleted top soil, thinned ozone and innumerable other disasters. And who is unaware of the threat of nuclear war? No wonder investors scare easily.</p>
        <p>Or do we feel guilty about prosperity? Brought up by a widowed mother who taught for a tuna-casserole salary, I often feel both elated and oppressed by my current material well-being. Basking in sunshine, I can still see the close shadows cast by poverty, unemployment, homelessness and hunger. Do others share my nagging guilt? Does it feed a panic? I also know I feel panicky when I'm not in control. Most investors must have known this week they weren't in control. Here in the Midwest, we are so removed from Wall Street that it seems like a remote foreign court. When I think of the stock exchange, I see machines everywhere, small and large, ticker tapes and computers, machines that crunch and spit out numbers, machines that buy and sell, machines that - like the market - sometimes crash.</p>
        <p>But panic wasn't the only emotion rampaging this week. On Monday, together with the reprehensible excitement of watching a great catastrophe, I also felt a strong surge of greed. ''Oh please,'' I begged my husband, ''if we buy some Dayton Hudson stock today we can be rich, rich, rich!''</p>
        <p>''At least,'' I amended, ''maybe we could go to Hawaii for Christmas.'' But my husband - who does remember the Depression - was unmoved.</p>
        <p>Urging that low-water plunge, I was, however, ignoring my own experience. Last year, when an unexpected check arrived, I decided to buy some stock. I'd just read a breathless newspaper article about a local company that designed cancer-cell machinery. The company sounded exciting, innovative and a hot number at $24. I bought a fistful. Three days later the paper ran another story: a Wall Street Journal reporter had found overstated assets and understated problems. With dazzling speed, my shares sank to 37 1/2 cents.</p>
        <p>So I must be optimistic about the market. Despite dark forebodings, imagination and historical knowledge, I sure wish I had spare cash to buy some of that cheap Dayton Hudson. Since Minnesota doesn't have a lottery, how else will I ever get to Hawaii?</p>
