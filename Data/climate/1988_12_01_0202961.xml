        <p>LEAD: President-elect Bush told a group of leading environmentalists today that he would carefully consider their recommendations for fighting pollution and protecting natural resources.</p>
        <p>President-elect Bush told a group of leading environmentalists today that he would carefully consider their recommendations for fighting pollution and protecting natural resources.</p>
        <p>At a breakfast meeting at the White House, leaders of 30 environmental groups handed Mr. Bush a report with more than 700 recommendations on how to deal with national and international environmental threats. They include global warming, the destruction of the earth's ozone shield, the loss of tropical forests, acid rain, urban smog, fresh water and ocean pollution, uncontrolled toxic substances, and what the report calls the ''inadequate protection of Federal lands.''</p>
        <p>The environmentalists also urged Mr. Bush to propose an adequate environmental budget, including an increase of at least 20 percent for the Environmental Protection Agency. In addition, they called for $5 billion in increases in environmentally related programs outside the E.P.A. Reductions Are Suggested, Too</p>
        <p>The report also proposed ways to reduce expenses - by eliminating some subsidies for nuclear power, coal and oil, for example - and to increase revenue - such as by increasing taxes on gasoline. They said these actions would more than offset the spending increases they recommended.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush can soon expect to receive another set of environmental recommendations that will take a slightly different approach to attacking environmental problems.</p>
        <p>Prepared with private funds under the sponsorship of Senator Timothy E. Wirth, Democrat of Colorado and Senator John Heinz, Republican of Pennsylvania, the report being readied for presentation to the President-elect, Project 88, will focus on ways to use market forces to protect the environment. Project 88 will argue that using private efforts to supplement and, in some cases, substitute for the current regulatory process will keep Federal costs down, the sponsors say. Message to Bush</p>
        <p>After today's meeting, the environmentalists said Mr. Bush promised to consider their advice and seemed receptive to their plea for active Presidential leadership to protection of the environment.</p>
        <p>Jay D. Hair, president of the National Wildlife Federation, related that ''I commented to Mr. Bush, 'Read my lips: protect the environment.' He smiled and said, 'I will, I will.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hair said he found the difference between Mr. Bush and President Reagan to be like ''night and day,'' saying the Reagan approach had been characterized by ''ideological shrillness and a lack of commitment to good stewardship of the land.''</p>
        <p>Among the environmentalists' recommendations was one to create a Cabinet-level Department of Environmental Protection to replace the E.P.A., which is not a Cabinet-level agency. Leadership Role Urged</p>
        <p>The report handed Mr, Bush, ''Blueprint for the Environment,'' called on the President-elect to convene a White House conference on the environment next year, to place the United States in a leadership role in meeting such international issues as global warming, and to appoint qualified people to environmental posts in his administration.</p>
        <p>Tina Hobson, executive director of Renew America, a nonprofit group that stresses energy conservation, said the environmentalists had urged Mr. Bush to assign to environmental jobs people who had ''demonstrated a strong commitment to the environment and a sense of stewardship for public resources'' and who would avoid the ''ideological'' approach of the early 1980's. She said that approach led to polarization over environmental issues.</p>
        <p>The President-elect, she said, ''agreed and said we would be pleased and surprised by some of his appointments.'' 'Dialogue' Is Desired</p>
        <p>C. Boyden Gray, counsel to the Bush transition team, was present at today's meeting and said later that the Vice President did not make any response to specific recommmendations. But he said Mr. Bush did say he wanted to continue a ''dialogue'' with the environmentalists and expressed an interest in the names they submitted for second- and third-level jobs within the Federal agencies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gray also reported that Mr, Bush told the environmentalists: ''I know there is some skepticism about my commitment. But it is real and I am going to surprise you in a good way.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush added, however, that there were bound to be disagreements between the environmentalists and his administration, Mr. Gray said.</p>
        <p>The Project 88 report of Senators Wirth and Heinz will make 36 recommendations for using market forces to tackle specific environmental problems. For example, the report calls for a system of marketable pollution permits for reducing urban smog and other air pollution.</p>
        <p>Under such a system, factories or power plants would be required to obtain permits to emit a certain amount of pollution into the air. Companies that reduce their pollution below their permit levels could sell their surplus polluting rights to other companies. Those who find it is too expensive to reduce pollution could buy rights to pollute more. Economic Incentives Seen</p>
        <p>Such a program, the report argues, would give companies economic incentives to reduce pollution. The plan will call for the permitted amounts of pollution to be reduced by the Government each year.</p>
        <p>A similar recommendation calls for reducing air pollution from cars and trucks by encouraging more efficient fuel use. For example, owners of cars that waste fuel would be taxed more heavily than now, while owners of cars that are very efficient would be entitled to tax rebates.</p>
        <p>In contrast, the ''Blueprint for the Environment'' handed Mr. Bush today focuses more on environmental goals than on specific means for getting there. When such means are proposed, they tend to be based on existing approaches. Clean Air Act Is Stressed</p>
        <p>To deal with air pollution, for example, the blueprint recommends that ''the President should support and work vigorously for reauthorization of the Clean Air Act, including acid rain controls,'' as well as ''rigorous standards for toxic air emissions, and deadlines that will bring all areas of the country rapidly into compliance with standards for healthy air.''</p>
        <p>The Environmental Defense Fund, one of the few national environmental groups that did not take part in the blueprint effort, chose to contribute to Project 88 instead. Frederic D. Krupp, executive director of the fund, said his group had chosen to work with Senators Wirth and Heinz because ''the problems are getting worse so the solutions have to be better - more powerful.''</p>
        <p>''We need to make changes,'' he added, ''but let's do it in the smartest, most efficient way.''</p>
