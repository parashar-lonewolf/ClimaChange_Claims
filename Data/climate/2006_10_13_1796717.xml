Or is he just an actor in a play within a play (2:30)? SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1515.</p>
        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE'  (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'JAY JOHNSON: THE TWO AND ONLY' A genial 90-minute entertainment giving Broadway audiences a chance to get reacquainted with the (almost) lost art of ventriloquism. Jay Johnson, the onetime star of the television comedy ''Soap,'' gives a pocket history of the profession, in addition to an ample demonstration, with partners that include a vulture who sings ''My Way,'' a foul-mouthed wooden tyke, a talking tennis ball and a monkey purveying some of the corniest shtick this side of a Friar's roast (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Charles Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'JERSEY BOYS'  (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped biomusical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'TARZAN'  This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE WEDDING SINGER'  An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Constantine Maroulis, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'ARMS AND THE MAN' Shaw's story of a mercenary who breaks into a young Bulgarian woman's bedroom while fleeing a battle seems not to have much social bite in this rendition, but the humor still works nicely, particularly when in the hands of Robin Leslie Brown and Dominic Cuskern as the invaded household's matriarch and patriarch. Bradford Cover has an appealing offhand delivery as the soldier (2:15). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Neil Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>'BIRTH AND AFTER BIRTH' Baby is a bruiser in Tina Howe's self-conscious foray into the jungles of absurdism. Written in 1972, this explosion of the nuclear family appears to be stepping, with cautious exactitude, in the footprints of early Edward Albee. Christian Parker directed the rather stilted cast (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'BLUE DOOR' An African-American math professor struggles to reconnect to his cultural past in this small but densely packed new play by Tanya Barfield. Reg E. Cathey is the math prof, abandoned by his wife and visited by the ghosts of his ancestors, all played by the vibrant young actor Andre Holland (1:35). Playwrights Horizons, Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'BUSH IS BAD: IMPEACHMENT EDITION' A musical revue of silly, heavy-handed sketches aimed at Bush-haters (1:30). Triad Theater, 158 West 72nd Street, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'DRUG BUDDY'  The aimless Texas drug dealers of David Folwell's slight slacker dramedy are one losers' club we wouldn't mind spending more time with, particularly the engaging lead, Matthew Stadelmann. But ''Drug Buddy'' leaves barely a bruise, let alone a buzz (51 minutes). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village, (212) 868-4444. (Rob Kendt)</p>
        <p>'ESOTERICA' Eric Walton's very entertaining one-man show is a mix of magic, mentalism and intelligent chat. He does all three impressively (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates)</p>
        <p>'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'GARDEL: THE MUSICAL' A standard-issue biomusical about the tango legend Carlos Gardel that wallows in melodrama (1:30). Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, (212) 225-9920. (Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'JOHN FERGUSON' This 1919 tragedy about a poor Irish family and how far its members will go not to lose their farm is a compelling, fully realized drama with a cast that doesn't miss a beat (2:20). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'KING LEAR' The ''promised end'' comes with disarming swiftness in this Classical Theater of Harlem production, starring André De Shields, which clocks in at just over two hours, not including an intermission. There's nothing distilled about Mr. De Shields's vigorous performance in the title role, but his impressive energy is not always productively channeled, and the supporting cast is uneven (2:10). The Harlem School of the Arts Theater, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'NIXON'S NIXON' Russell Lees's savory political satire takes place on the night before the president announced his resignation. Gerry Bamman and Steve Mellor created the roles of Nixon and Kissinger, respectively, in the original production from 1995, also directed by Jim Simpson, and they return to them with the ease of veteran vaudevillians slipping back into a comfortable partnership (1:30). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'NO CHILD'  Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE'  A slow, airless revival of Jay Presson Allen's 1966 play (adapted from Muriel Spark's novel) about a dangerous Scottish schoolteacher, directed by Scott Elliott and starring the wonderful (but miscast) Cynthia Nixon, who seems much too sane and centered as the deluded Miss Brody. (2:40). The Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'RICHARD II' Michael Cumpsty plays the ineffectual king who loses a crown and gains a soul in Brian Kulick's middling production for the Classic Stage Company. Mr. Cumpsty traces Richard's worldly downfall and spiritual ascent with affecting clarity, but the production is a little glib and a little bland (2:15). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'SHOUT!' A miniskirted, go-go-booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the showroom of a Carnival cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'SONGS OF THE DRAGONS FLYING TO HEAVEN' Young Jean Lee has fashioned a hysterically funny piece of theater with twisted socio-political power and giggly Korean dancers who would fit right into a Quentin Tarantino movie (1:30). Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 868-4444. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'SUBURBIA' This black-hole revival of Eric Bogosian's 1994 group portrait of losers in Angstville, U.S.A., directed by Jo Bonney, features lively performances from Gaby Hoffman, Kieran Culkin and Jessica Capshaw. But even if you're as success-addicted as Donald Trump, you're likely to find yourself identifying with these characters in the wrong way: They're beyond caring what happens to them, and so are you (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)</p>
        <p>* 'THE TOOTH OF CRIME' This highly entertaining revival of Sam Shepard's musical comic-book melodrama about celebrity, mortality and rock 'n' roll may not be the slickest show around. But as directed by George Ferencz, it brings a demystifying clarity to a work often dismissed as a smoky head trip and makes a strong case for ''Tooth'' as one of Mr. Shepard's best plays (2:15). La MaMa Annex, 66 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE TREATMENT' A new play by Eve Ensler (''The Vagina Monologues'') depicting fraught encounters between a traumatized war veteran and a military psychologist. Fervently acted by Dylan McDermott and Portia, it is an overwrought amalgam of psychodrama and political sermonizing (1:05). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983, impactfestival.org. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'WRECKS' The tail wags the scorpion in the latest play by Neil LaBute to be propelled by a poisoned lunch line. This slender, prickly tease of a monologue -- whose whole raison-d'etre is its last-minute revelation -- is given substance by an expert performance by Ed Harris as a newly bereaved widower (1:15). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Off Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'¡EL CONQUISTADOR!' Thaddeus Phillips's one-man show about a hapless Colombian doorman can be slow, but it's also ingenious and an excellent showcase for Mr. Phillips, who would have made a great silent-movie comedian (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'THE THUGS' Rumors of death at a law firm make Adam Bock's new play a chilling little nightmare (1:15). SoHo Rep, 46 Walker Street, between Church Street and Broadway, TriBeCa, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)</p>
        <p>Long-Running Shows</p>
        <p>'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). New World Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)</p>
        <p>'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)</p>
        <p>'SPAMALOT'  A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans. (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>'FOOLS AND LOVERS' The idea itself is questionable: let's make a musical about a chintzy wedding based entirely on Shakespearean texts. And the realization does not improve on the inspiration. Andrew Sherman's music perfectly duplicates the aesthetic of a second-rate wedding band, and to add a layer of realism, many of the actors have trouble carrying a tune. All that the exercise ultimately proves is that you can make Shakespeare say anything (1:20). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444; closing on Sunday. (Anne Midgette)</p>
        <p>'IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING' Bill Bowers's zestful, endearing one-man show is about his life as a mime, an actor and a gay boy growing up in Montana (1:15). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, off Seventh Avenue South, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'THE PAIN AND THE ITCH'  A sharp-elbowed new comedy by Bruce Norris about the indiscreet hypocrisies of the urban liberal bourgeoisie. Some familiar dysfunctions and some more exotic ones disrupt Thanksgiving dinner. Funny but tough to stomach (2:00). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'SISTERS' Declan Hassett's dark tale of sibling rivalry set in rural Ireland occasions the welcome return to the New York stage of Anna Manahan, the Irish actress who won a Tony in 1998 playing the ferociously needy mother in Martin McDonagh's ''Beauty Queen of Leenane.'' A bit less welcome is Mr. Hassett's relentlessly downbeat play itself (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THEOPHILUS NORTH' Matthew Burnett's adaptation of the Thornton Wilder novel about a young man's not quite interpersonal relationships in 1926 Newport is affable if sometimes oversentimental (2:00). Harold Clurman Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes tomorrow. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'WASPS IN BED' This Berkshires-to-bedroom farce would make a clever sitcom, if only the authors would face the fact that it isn't really about sex (1:45). Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Gates)</p>

        <p>'ALL THE KING'S MEN' (PG-13, 120 minutes) This second adaptation of Robert Penn Warren's big novel of political and spiritual corruption in Depression-era Louisiana is full of grand themes, good actors (Jude Law, Sean Penn, Kate Winslet, Mark Ruffalo) and lovingly-photographed southern scenery. And yet nothing seems to work. It's a chaotic stew of ambitions and ideas, but in the end neither convincing nor coherent. (A. O. Scott)</p>
        <p>'THE BLACK DAHLIA' (R, 119 minutes) Brian De Palma drains the life out of James Ellroy's take on the spectacularly cruel 1947 murder of a young Los Angeles woman known as the Black Dahlia. The stars Josh Hartnett, Scarlett Johansson and Aaron Eckhart don't help matters, though Hilary Swank is dandy. (Manohla Dargis)</p>
        <p>'BLACK GOLD' (No rating, 78 minutes, in English, Oromifa and Amharic) This documentary tells an unresolved modern version of the age-old David and Goliath story. The giants in this case are multinational corporations that control the worldwide coffee market. The heroic little guy, Tadesse Meskela, who represents the Oromo Coffee Farmers Co-op Union, devotes himself tirelessly to traveling the world looking for buyers who will pay a fair price for the beans harvested by the country's 70,000 coffee farmers. (Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>'BROKEN SKY' (No rating, 140 minutes, in Spanish) Boy meets boy, as you've never seen, in Julián Hernández's sex-drenched, extravagantly minimalist epic. (Nathan Lee)</p>
        <p>* 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller ''Infernal Affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH' (PG, 103 minutes) A minimum-wage comedy chronicling the romance between a slacker box boy (Dane Cook) and a bodacious cashier (Jessica Simpson) working at a Costco-like megastore. Directed by Greg Coolidge with the creative flair of an entry-level training video, the movie is tireder than a Wal-Mart greeter at the end of a Saturday shift. (Jeannette Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* '49 UP' (No rating, 134 minutes) In the latest installment of documentary cinema's longest-running, most fascinating experiment, the British schoolchildren first interviewed in ''7 Up'' (1964) have settled into middle age. As always, there are quiet revelations and surprises, and ordinary human experience somehow becomes more fascinating and mysterious than any other subject. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'FLYBOYS' (PG-13, 129 minutes) Empty-headed and egregiously polite, this nostalgia trip to World War I is what you'd get if Norman Rockwell directed ''Top Gun.'' (Lee)</p>
        <p>'GRIDIRON GANG' (PG-13, 120 minutes) Set in a California juvenile detention center, ''Gridiron Gang'' stars Dwayne Johnson, best known as the Rock, as Sean Porter, the real-life probation officer who fights recidivism with football. Jumping from heartwarming to murderous, this is a sports-as-rehab movie that wants to have its gangbanging and cure it, too. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'A GUIDE TO RECOGNIZING YOUR SAINTS' (R, 98 minutes) Rough, ragged and full of life, this autobiographical movie, written and directed by Dito Montiel, about his youth on the streets of Astoria, Queens, is a remarkable debut, stuffed almost to bursting with bold performances and operatic emotions. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'THE GUARDIAN' (PG-13, 139 minutes) A veteran Coast Guard rescue swimmer (Kevin Costner) mentors a young hotshot swimming champion (Ashton Kutcher) in this predictable, overly long but nonetheless serviceable tribute to a branch of the United States military that has been somewhat neglected in the movies. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'THE ILLUSIONIST' (PG-13, 109 minutes) This film tells the story of Eisenheim (Edward Norton), a fictional conjurer who enraptured Viennese audiences in 1900 with his supernatural magic shows. A terrific yarn, it rouses your slumbering belief in the miraculous. (Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'INVINCIBLE' (PG, 99 minutes) The latest addition to the Disney stable of sports-underdog movies, ''Invincible'' is the true story of Vince Papale (Mark Wahlberg), a substitute teacher and part-time bartender, who in 1976 realizes his dream of playing for the Philadelphia Eagles. The director and cinematographer, Ericson Core, counters the story's predictably inspirational trajectory with close attention to historical detail and blue-collar hardship. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'JACKASS: NUMBER TWO' (R, 92 minutes) Debased, infantile and reckless in the extreme, this compendium of body bravado and malfunction makes for some of the most fearless, liberated and cathartic comedy in modern movies. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'JET LI'S FEARLESS' (PG-13, 105 minutes, in Mandarin) Jet Li says goodbye (supposedly) to the martial arts genre with this decent blend of old-school chopsocky and new-school superproduction. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'KETTLE OF FISH' (R, 93 minutes) Casting Gina Gershon as a mousy scientist (yeah, right) is the first mistake, though by no means the last, in this deeply misguided romantic comedy. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker plays the mad king, while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'THE LAST KISS' (R, 104 minutes) Tony Goldwyn's remake of a popular Italian film is thin and clumsy, but nonetheless unusually candid in its treatment of human sexual misbehavior. Zach Braff plays a young man who, on the brink of turning 30 and about to become a father, panics and cheats on his girlfriend (Jacinda Barrett). (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'OPEN SEASON' (PG, 100 minutes) In this grand-scale animated comedy-adventure about a grizzly bear and a mule deer who assemble an oddball army of animals to fight the hunters, periodic bursts of cleverness and eye-popping imagery, further enhanced in the 3-D IMAX version, can't disguise that it's just another movie full of jive-talking computer-generated animals with little new to say. (Laura Kern)</p>
        <p>* 'OUT OF PLACE: MEMORIES OF EDWARD SAID' and 'EDWARD SAID: THE LAST INTERVIEW' (No rating, 138 minutes and 114 minutes, in English, Arabic and Hebrew) Two documentaries about the Palestinian writer and thinker Edward Said explore his life, his chronic alienation and his sympathy for the Palestinian cause. Loosely framed by readings from Mr. Said's 1999 memoir of the same title, ''Out of Place: Memories of Edward Said'' is less a biography than a rambling meditation on exile, identity and the psychological scars of dispossession. More satisfying is the complex portrait provided by ''Edward Said: The Last Interview,'' a riveting record of Mr. Said's 2002 conversation with the journalist Charles Glass. Engrossing and wide-ranging, the film proves that a couch, a camera and a great mind can be all the inspiration a filmmaker needs. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'THE QUEEN' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Directed by Stephen Frears from a very smart script by Peter Morgan, and starring a magnificent Helen Mirren in the title role, ''The Queen'' pries open a window in the House of Windsor around the time of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, blending fact with fiction. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'SCHOOL FOR SCOUNDRELS' (PG-13, 101 minutes) Billy Bob Thornton stars as an alpha scoundrel who runs a self-improvement course for sad sacks of the sort persuasively played by the film's other lead actor, Jon Heder. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'THE SCIENCE OF SLEEP' (R, 106 minutes, in English, French and Spanish) A bittersweet dream of romance from Michel Gondry. Inventive and enchanting. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'SHORTBUS' (No rating, 102 minutes) John Cameron Mitchell's ode to the joy and sweet release of sex also manages to be a sincere, modest political venture that finds humor where you might least expect it. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE: THE BEGINNING' (R, 84 minutes) A prequel to a remake of a 1974 movie that spawned several sequels and numberless copycats, this hateful trash begs the question: how many chainsaw massacres can one state possibly contain? (Lee)</p>
        <p>'WRESTLING WITH ANGELS: PLAYWRIGHT TONY KUSHNER' (No rating, 98 minutes) In this entertaining but shallow documentary portrait of the playwright Tony Kushner, its likable subject contradicts the cliché image of the left-wing intellectual as a grim, preachy commissar of political correctness. He comes across as a welcoming public figure who has a gift for being very funny and serious at the same time. (Holden)</p>
        <p>Film Series</p>
        <p>'ÉCLATS DE RIRE' (Through Oct. 31) The French Institute Alliance Française is screening French comedies every Tuesday.

The film, about Washingtonians who maneuver, stars Henry Fonda and a scene-stealing Charles Laughton. Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates)</p>

        <p>Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.</p>
        <p>ART BRUT (Wednesday and Thursday) Rock 'n' roll needs to celebrate as well as ridicule its own mythology, and Art Brut, sarcastically but exuberantly singing about the thrill of plugging in and making a ruckus -- ''Formed a band, we formed a band/Look at us, we formed a band!'' -- is one of the rare groups that can do both. With Spinto Band. Wednesday at 8 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; $17.50 in advance, $19 at the door.

        <p>BECK (Wednesday) Since he broke through with the slacker anthem ''Loser'' in 1994, Beck has waffled between snidely ironic hip-hop pastiche and glum acoustic balladry. His latest, ''The Information'' (Interscope), is in the hip-hop category, with the kind of pop-culture crazy-quilt lyrics that only Beck could come up with: ''I got a silicon Bible song/Paranoid Jumbotron.'' With Spank Rock. At 8 p.m., the Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $54.50. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* CBGB (Tonight through Sunday) The clock is ticking for CBGB, the storied Bowery dive that in the 1970's incubated New York's greatest generation of punk rock. The club must close by the end of the month, and the shows this weekend have been billed as its last. The Dictators, whose muscular three-chord chants are paragons of tidy melody and obnoxious humor, play tonight and tomorrow night. Also tomorrow, Debbie Harry and Chris Stein of Blondie offer an acoustic set. Sunday night is the big blowout with Patti Smith and her band. At 8 p.m., 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052, cbgb.com; sold out. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>C. J. CHENIER (Sunday) The son of Clifton Chenier, who was the undisputed king of zydeco, C. J. Chenier picked up his father's accordion and his Red Hot Louisiana Band in the 1980's, carrying on the family tradition of bayou dance music laced with blues. At 7:30 p.m., with a free dance lesson at 6:30, Connolly's, 121 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-7597, letszydeco.com; $22. (Jon Pareles)</p>
        <p>DIRTY DOZEN BRASS BAND (Tonight) The magnificent ensemble that revitalized New Orleans brass-band music. It swaggers through the city's whole musical heritage: parades, rumba, swing, bebop and modern jazz, for starters. Solos can head for the far side of tonality, but the band never loses touch with gutbucket, danceable funk. At 11, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $19. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>DJ SHADOW (Tuesday and Wednesday) The high priest of disorienting turntable collage makes an appearance in support of his first new album in four years, ''The Outsider'' (Island). At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $32 in advance, $35 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>DUB TRIO (Thursday) Made up of well-traveled session players for the likes of the Fugees and Mos Def, Dub Trio plays spacious reggae grooves spiked with high-adrenaline punk, affectionately recalling Bad Brains. At 8 and 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; $10 a set. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>VINCE GILL (Monday) This sweet-voiced country classicist is touring with a 17-piece band and an especially big addition to his repertory: on Tuesday he will release ''These Days'' (MCA Nashville), a four-CD set of all new material, featuring Sheryl Crow, Bonnie Raitt, Michael McDonald, Gretchen Wilson, LeAnn Rimes and enough other stars to fill a downtown Nashville honky-tonk. At 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; $35 to $50. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>GOLDFRAPP (Wednesday) Led by Allison Goldfrapp, a techno glamourpuss part Marlene Dietrich and part Debbie Harry, this British duo plays cool, vaguely futuristic electronica. At 7:30 p.m., Roseland, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $30 in advance, $34 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>JOLIE HOLLAND (Wednesday) With a playful quiver of a voice that can make her resemble a countryfied Billie Holliday, and a junk-shop aesthetic that mingles brassy swing with Appalachian folk, Ms. Holland sings charming, deceptively childlike songs: ''Crush in the Ghetto,'' on her new album, ''Springtime Can Kill You'' (Anti-), finds her overdressed on a bus ride home from a one-night stand. With David Dondero. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>INDIGO GIRLS (Tonight) Guitar strumming, close harmonies, coffeehouse earnestness and songs about the perpetual struggle for love, self-affirmation and a clear conscience have made the duo of Emily Saliers and Amy Ray perennials for the collegiate at heart. With Roman Candle. At 8, Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $30 and $40. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>* LADYSMITH BLACK MAMBAZO (Tuesday) This great South African vocal group, which introduced so much of the world to close, bass-heavy Zulu harmony on Paul Simon's ''Graceland,'' is at Carnegie Hall for the first time since appearing with Mr. Simon there 19 years ago. Guests include Sarah McLachlan, Natalie Merchant, the Mahotella Queens, Vusi Mahlasela and Pete Seeger. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $21 to $72. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>JENNY LEWIS (Tonight) Already the sad-eyed, short-skirted princess of indie rock as the lead singer of Rilo Kiley, Jenny Lewis made an inspired step with her first solo album, whose luscious country-gospel ruminations of romantic and spiritual doubt (''It's not that I believe in your almighty/But I might as well as insurance or bail'') made her its Dusty Springfield as well. At 8, Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, the-townhall-nyc.org; $25. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>PET SHOP BOYS (Tomorrow) The British duo that perfected the pouty and aloof techno-pop of Human League returned this year with ''Fundamental'' (Capitol), a reunion with Trevor Horn, one of its 1980's producers. Only the Pet Shop Boys can sing jabberwocky lines like ''I thought I heard a train/Down in the cemetery/Cellophane'' and make them sound sexy and evil. At 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $29.50 to $99.50. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>RASCAL FLATTS (Tomorrow) The sweetest, most tooth-rotting bubblegum is always the best. This pop-country trio -- big emphasis on pop -- specializes in a kind of mawkish sentimentality that has to be admired for sheer shamelessness, as in ''Skin (Sarabeth),'' an after-school special with a waltz beat about a girl with leukemia: ''It would be a mistake/For someone to take/A girl with no hair to the prom.'' (Her date shaves his head in sympathy.) At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $44.50 to $84.50. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS, MARS VOLTA (Tuesday and Wednesday) Though their transformation from sex-mad punk-funk pranksters to crooning penitents is pretty much complete, the Red Hot Chili Peppers are not above the occasional appearance dressed only in tube socks (not on their feet). With the Mars Volta, leaders of the unlikely renaissance of byzantine prog-metal. At 8 p.m., Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900, meadowlands.com; $63. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>ROYAL DRUMMERS OF BURUNDI (Tomorrow and Monday) First heard by most Western listeners as the spooky, lusty pulse on Joni Mitchell's 1975 album ''The Hissing of Summer Lawns,'' these musicians and dancers -- who sometimes call themselves the Master Drummers of Burundi, or simply the Drummers of Burundi -- conjure an elemental musical force through ritualized unison percussion. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Grace Rainey Rodgers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $50. Sunday at 3 p.m., Lehman Center for the Performing Arts, 250 Bedford Park Boulevard West, at Goulden Avenue, Bedford Park, the Bronx, (718) 960-8833, lehmancenter.org; $20 to $35. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>EARL SCRUGGS (Tonight) Bluegrass banjo as we know it simply would not exist without Earl Scruggs, who joined Bill Monroe's Blue Grass Boys in 1945 and proceeded to revolutionize banjo playing with a three-finger picking style that accelerates to ballistic speeds. At 7:45 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $40. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>ANOUSHKA SHANKAR (Thursday) The sitarist Anoushka Shankar, who has up to this point been an aesthetic acolyte of her father's lithe, neo-traditional take on improvisatory raga, has recently been experimenting with a combination of acoustic and electronic backing instrumentation. At 8 p.m., Grace Rainey Rodgers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $55. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>SOCIAL DISTORTION (Tonight) Formed in 1978 by its songwriter, Mike Ness, Social Distortion plays punk-rock with a roots-rock twang. In his songs Mr. Ness is still trying to figure out the meaning of life, chronicling everything from anti-fashion stubbornness to feeling his age. At 8:30, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>* 'THE SPIRIT OF FÈS' (Tomorrow) The Festival of Sacred Music in Fès, Morocco, is the inspiration for this ecumenical concert. It includes Daqqa Roudania, a group from Morocco, performing ecstatic, percussion-driven Sufi music and dance; Gerard Edery singing Sephardic songs that hark back to Renaissance music; Susan Hellauer from Anonymous 4, singing Gregorian chant; the South Indian classical singer Aruna Sairam, with Hindu devotional music; and Arabic music from Zafer Tawil, playing oud and violin, and Jamey Haddad on percussion. At 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $30 and $42. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>ELAINE STRITCH (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) The third autobiographical go-round by this feisty 81-year-old legend features 10 astutely chosen new songs (including the theme from ''The Sopranos'') performed with verve and humor. But her between-song patter finds her at a loss to come up with amusing or enlightening new stories from her glittering show business life. At 8:45 p.m., Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $125; dinner required. (Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>TILLY AND THE WALL (Tuesday) An indie-rock band playing tuneful, yearning anthems of sexuality and confusion is nothing new, but this Omaha quintet has one truly unusual (and effective) gimmick: the percussion comes from the manic tap-dancing of one of its members, Jamie Williams. With Northern State. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>TV ON THE RADIO (Tuesday and Wednesday) One of Brooklyn's most consistently intriguing bands, TV on the Radio casts a dark and seductive spell with swirling electronics, washes of Pixies-esque guitar and, most alluringly, vocals that draw from both early Peter Gabriel and doo-wop. With Grizzly Bear. At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>YOU AM I (Wednesday and Thursday) With its exhilarating rave-ups and Tim Rogers's windmill guitar slashes -- both recalling the best of the Who -- You Am I is one of the most exciting bands to come out of Australia in a decade, though it has struggled for recognition here. At 9 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $15. (Sisario)</p>

        <p>Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.</p>
        <p>* SATHIMA BEA BENJAMIN (Tuesday) As a singer, Ms. Benjamin shines on standards without forsaking her South African heritage, a subtle achievement represented on a career-spanning new compilation called ''Song Spirit'' (Ekapa). She performs here in celebration of her 70th birthday, with instrumental support from the pianist Onaje Allan Gumbs, the bassist Buster Williams and the drummer Victor Lewis. At 8 and 9:30 p.m., Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626, sweetrhythmny.com; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Nate Chinen)</p>
        <p>CHRIS BOTTI/JOHN PIZZARELLI (Tonight) Mr. Botti has emerged as the lite-jazz hero of our time, a trumpeter whose photogenic presence and brooding sensuality both suit the current notion of the standard songbook as a lifestyle accessory. His low-gloss polish is likable, and in concert he tends to stretch out a bit with his band, which is first-rate. For a more buoyant take on jazz-pop crossover, though, look to the other half of this bill, featuring Mr. Pizzarelli, the ever-breezy guitarist and singer. At 8, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, One Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722, www.njpac.org; $20 to $58. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>DON BYRON PLAYS JUNIOR WALKER (Tonight through Sunday night) The clarinetist Don Byron has lately been playing more tenor saxophone, a development that motivated his latest concept album, ''Do the Boomerang'' (Blue Note). It's a tribute to the Motown saxophonist-singer Junior Walker, by a clutch of musicians equally at home playing jazz and soul: the guitarist David Gilmore, the keyboardist George Colligan, the bassist Brad Jones and the drummer Rodney Holmes. One of the two vocalists on the album, Chris Thomas King, will also appear. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $25; $30 tonight and tomorrow.

        <p>REGINA CARTER (Wednesday and Thursday) Ms. Carter is a jazz violinist of uncommon accomplishment: a few years ago she became the first African-American musician to play Paganini's cherished instrument in Genoa, Italy, and a few weeks ago she received a prestigious ''genius grant'' from the MacArthur Foundation. Her recent album ''I'll Be Seeing You: A Sentimental Journey'' (Verve) honors the memory of her mother by reinterpreting some of the prewar popular songs she loved. (Through Oct. 21.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>STEVE COLEMAN AND FIVE ELEMENTS (Tuesday and Wednesday) Mr. Coleman's alto saxophone cuts cleanly through the angular free-funk of his signature ensemble, which includes Jonathan Finlayson on trumpet, Tim Albright on trombone, Jen Shyu on vocals, Tyshawn Sorey on drums and, on Wednesday only, Thomas Morgan on bass. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $12; members, $10. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>COOPER-MOORE QUARTET/MATANA ROBERTS QUARTET (Tomorrow) The man known as Cooper-Moore, an extreme polyglot even by avant-garde standards, leads a band that features his own handmade instruments alongside the alto saxophone of Darius Jones and the percussion of Juma Santos and Chad Taylor. Matana Roberts, a husky-toned alto saxophonist and junior member of the A.A.C.M., is at her best when responding to ensemble actions; her group, performing in a later set, includes the tenor saxophonist Matt Bauder, the bassist Tom Abbs and the drummer Tomas Fujiwara. At 7:30 and 9 p.m., Clemente Soto Vélez SEA Theater, 107 Suffolk Street, at Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 696-6681, visionfestival.org; cover, $20 a set. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>EDDIE DANIELS's 65TH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION (Thursday) The clarinetist Eddie Daniels will reach standard retirement age on Thursday, though he doesn't seem to have much interest in laying back. The first of his four nights at Iridium will feature numerous guests, including his fellow clarinetists Ken Peplowski, Ron Odrich and Paquito D'Rivera (who also plays alto saxophone). The house rhythm section will consist of Joe Locke on vibraphone, David Finck on bass and Joe La Barbera on drums. (Through Oct. 22.) At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $32.50, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>* FESTIVAL OF NEW TRUMPET MUSIC (Tonight through Sunday night) This stylistically expansive series concludes this weekend, after a month of horn-centric programming. Tonight the trumpeters John McNeil and Ron Horton jointly present a group that also includes a third trumpeter, the festival's founder, Dave Douglas; tomorrow there will be sets led by Butch Morris and then Ted Daniel. The series finale, a benefit for music programs in New York public schools, will feature an honor roll of guests, including the composer and alto saxophonist John Zorn, the bassist Henry Grimes and the Zlatne Uste Balkan Brass Band. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 10:30, Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; cover, $15, with a one-drink minimum. Sunday from 2 to 5 p.m. at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-6377, fontmusic.org; $20 to $100. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>DIZZY GILLESPIE ALL-STAR BIG BAND (Tuesday through Thursday) Bebop's goateed ambassador did some of his best work with big bands, a fact that this repertory ensemble, led by his former trombonist and arranger Slide Hampton, happily exploits. The band -- which has a strong recent album, ''Dizzy's Business'' (Telarc) -- includes other veterans of Gillespie's employ, like the saxophonists James Moody and Paquito D'Rivera. The trumpeter Roy Hargrove is a natural choice to fill Gillespie's shoes. (Through Oct. 22.) At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>* JIM HALL TRIO (Tuesday through Thursday) Jim Hall's economical style and deep harmonic command have made him a quiet hero of jazz guitar; he leads his regular trio with the bassist Steve LaSpina and the drummer Terry Clarke. (Through Oct. 22.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.net; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>STEFON HARRIS (Wednesday) ''African Tarantella: Dances With Duke'' (Blue Note) is the sixth album by the vibraphonist Stefon Harris, and one of his strongest; it's an interpretation of music from two Duke Ellington suites, along with several original themes. As he does on the album, Mr. Harris augments his working quartet here with the trombonist Steve Turre, the clarinetist Mark Vinci, the flutist Anne Drummond, the cellist Louise Dubin and the violist Junah Chung. At 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $44. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>JIMMY HEATH'S 80TH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION (Tonight through Sunday night) The saxophonist and composer Jimmy Heath will turn 80 this month, and the Blue Note is celebrating the occasion with an engagement replete with such special guests as the trumpeter Clark Terry (tonight and tomorrow) and the saxophonist and flutist James Moody (Sunday), who have both infused their octogenarian years with youthful brio. At 8 and 10:30, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>RODNEY KENDRICK (Tonight) Mr. Kendrick is a commanding pianist who has gradually been returning to the spotlight after a bit of a hiatus. He appears as part of a new Fazioli Salon solo piano series at the Klavierhaus workshop. At 8, Klavierhaus, 211 West 58th Street, Manhattn, (212) 245-4535, pianoculture.com; $20. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>* LATIN JAZZ CONCERT USA (Thursday) A rich bonanza of Afro-Caribbean and Latin American artists, including the conga legend Candido Camero, the flutist Dave Valentin, the singer Xiomara Laugart and the guitarist and singer David Oquendo, among many others. At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824, the-townhall-nyc.org; $30 to $60. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>BEN MONDER (Wednesday) ''Oceana'' (Sunnyside), the most recent album by the guitarist Ben Monder, is a small-scale but ambitious suite of original music that doesn't sound quite like anything else. He will present some of the same material here, with the bassist Ben Street and the drummer Ted Poor. At 9:30 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, near Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 929-9883, 55bar.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>MARK MURPHY (Tomorrow and Sunday) Mr. Murphy is a singer known mainly for sly insouciance, but on his recent album ''Once to Every Heart'' (Verve), he opted for a burnished and broken romanticism. He is performing with a small group featuring the pianist Misha Piatigorsky. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., with a midnight set tomorrow, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>MICHAEL MUSILLAMI TRIO (Wednesday) Serpentine lyricism and angular forms are major attributes of ''Dachau,'' an album released last year by the guitarist Michael Mussillami on his own Playscape label. Joined by the bassist Joe Fonda and the drummer George Schuller, he'll revisit that recording, as well as a newer one, ''Fragile Forms,'' also on Playscape. At 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>TED NASH QUINTET (Tuesday through Thursday) The saxophonist Ted Nash has proved to be a smart and resourceful bandleader, especially for ensembles like this one, which has Marcus Printup on trumpet, Frank Kimbrough on piano, Ben Allison on bass and Matt Wilson on drums. (Through Oct. 22.) At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>ROY NATHANSON (Wednesday) ''Sotto Voce'' (AUM Fidelity), the latest recording by the saxophonist Roy Nathanson, makes full use of his unusual skills as a conceptualist and raconteur. All the members of his band double on vocals, occasionally suggesting a literate and subversive barbershop quartet; one, Napoleon Maddox, provides the beat-box percussion that hustles the music along. At 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778, joespub.com; cover, $15, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>AARON PARKS QUARTET (Tonight) Aaron Parks, a promising young pianist who has turned heads for the past few years in Terence Blanchard's working band, leads a quartet full of fine players: the guitarist Ben Monder, the bassist Matt Brewer and the drummer Rodney Green. At 9 and 10:30, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $15; members, $10. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>SECTION QUARTET/TRAVIS SULLIVAN'S BJORKESTRA (Thursday) Two young ensembles, each focused on repertory of a contemporary strain: the Section Quartet takes a crack at the Radiohead album ''OK Computer,'' while the Bjorkestra scores the music of Bjork for big band. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, kaufman-center.org; $25 ($20 in advance). (Chinen)</p>
        <p>US FREE (Tuesday and Wednesday) The drummer Andrew Cyrille and the bassist Henry Grimes are members of an avant-garde jazz generation that came of age in the 1960's and 70's, while the tenor saxophonist Bill McHenry is a comparably newer arrival who has earned respect in his peer group and beyond. The trio has a goofy name that will probably ring true, with collectivity and freedom high on the agenda. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $20. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>* BEBO VALDÉS (Tonight and tomorrow) Mr. Valdés, a pianist, composer and august figure in the history of Cuban music, won a Grammy and a Latin Grammy last year for his superlative album ''Bebo de Cuba'' (Calle 54). The centerpiece of that album is ''Suite Cubana,'' an opus for big band; he will conduct it here with the Afro-Latin Jazz Orchestra, a resident ensemble of Jazz at Lincoln Center. Mr. Valdés, who turned 88 this week, will also play the piano with musicians culled from the ranks of the orchestra, including some who appeared on the album. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500, jalc.org; $37.50 to $127.50. (Chinen)</p>

        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>'LA BOHÈME' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) Updated to the years around World War I, this is one of the New York City Opera's best productions. A new cast has taken over, including two singers new to the company, Inna Dukach as Mimi and Robert Gardner as Marcello. Dinyar Vania will sing Rodolfo; Dana Beth Miller is the Musetta; Kyungmook Yum is Schaunard; and Eric Jordan is Colline. Steven Mosteller conducts. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Anne Midgette)</p>
        <p>'CARMEN' (Wednesday) Rinat Shaham, who made her company debut as Zerlina, is a small singer for Carmen; worse, New York City Opera's production seems to have veiled her spark, rendering her a mere stereotype. Her Don José, Mark Duffin, has warm lower notes and a pressed, often flat sound on top; the Escamillo is Adrian Gans, who made his company debut in the role. The high point is Latonia Moore, a radiant-voiced Micaëla. Ari Pelto conducts, a little woodenly but competently enough. At 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $125. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>'The ELIxIr of love' (Tonight, Sunday and Thursday) The director Jonathan Miller has created an all-American ''Elisir d'Amore,'' transposing the action to a vintage roadside diner to create something that's dramatically consistent but also dramatically slight. Yet ''Elixir'' is a delightful opera, and it's decently sung by Anna Skibinsky, an Adina with a little ribbon of a voice; John Tessier, an honest, solid, if North American Nemorino; and especially Jan Opalach, who has a lot of fun and sounds very good as Dulcamara. George Manahan's conducting is not exactly Italianate. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 1:30 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>'FAUST' (Monday and Thursday) Gounod's lush score is back at the Metropolitan Opera in Andrei Serban's staging, now less hyperactive than when it was introduced in 2005. Alas, someone appears to have gotten to its soul before Méphistophélès had the chance: the singers, though all fine, put the drama at arm's length, so the work's intense passions don't quite come through. The cast includes Ramón Vargas in the title role, Ruth Ann Swenson as Marguerite, and Ildar Abdrazakov as Méphistophélès, with Bertrand de Billy conducting. On Thursday Darina Takova takes over the role of Marguerite, and Fernando de la Mora replaces Mr. Vargas. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $320. (Allan Kozinn)</p>
        <p>'LA GIOCONDA' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) This wild and woolly exercise in hate and mayhem continues at the Metropolitan Opera, with stirring music, old-fashioned production values and a strong cast that includes Violeta Urmana, Olga Borodina and Aquiles Machado. On Wednesday Aprile Millo replaces Ms. Urmana. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $320. (Bernard Holland)</p>
        <p>* 'IDOMENEO' (Tomorrow) Those who count on Ben Heppner to sing the heldentenor repertory may be surprised to hear him in the title role of Mozart's 1781 opera seria. But this role of the tormented king of Crete after the Trojan War has heroic dimensions, dramatically and vocally, which Mr. Heppner relishes in his clarion and compelling yet elegantly Mozartean portrayal. The rich-voiced mezzo-soprano Kristine Jepson is Idomeneo's devoted son Idamante. In the crucial role of Ilia, Nicole Heaston takes the place of Dorothea Röschmann in tomorrow's performance. James Levine conducts. Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's 1982 production is still handsome and effective. At 1 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $42 to $320. (Anthony Tommasini)</p>
        <p>* 'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Tuesday) The abstract staging in Anthony Minghella's 0visually beautiful production deftly employs movable screens, billowing fabrics, stylized costumes and a life-size puppet manipulated by three black-clad puppeteers to portray Butterfly's 3-year-old son. Vocally, neither of the leads, the earthy-voiced soprano Cristina Gallardo-Domâs as Butterfly and the robustly Italianate tenor Marcello Giordani as Pinkerton, is ideal. But they do honorable work. Asher Fisch conducts. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>'THE MERRY WIDOW' (Tonight and tomorrow, and Sunday) The enterprising Dicapo Opera Theater has some ambitious productions lined up, including a revised version of ''Thérèse Raquin'' by Tobias Picker, who composed ''An American Tragedy'' for the Met. But Dicapo opens its season with a new production by Michael Capasso of this frothy, tuneful and worldly-wise Lehar operetta. It will use spoken dialogue that was essentially rewritten by the playwright Wendy Wasserstein. Constantine Kitsopoulos conducts. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 4 p.m., 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-9438, dicapo.com; $47.50. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>'ORPHEUS' (Tonight) Next season at Glimmerglass is under the star of Orpheus, not figuratively but literally: All four operas represent different takes on the Orpheus legend, from Offenbach's irreverent satire to Philip Glass's ''Orphée.'' In a kind of preview recital tonight, excerpts from all five operas (the others are by Monteverdi, Gluck and Haydn) will join other Orpheus songs by Vaughan Williams and Schubert. Among the good young singers are the sopranos Caroline Worra and Michael Maniaci -- yes, he's a man, and he will sing the lead in the Gluck/Berlioz version. At 7:30, Morgan Library, 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 590-0392, www.themorgan.org; $45; $35 for members. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>* 'DIE TOTE STADT' (Tomorrow) Erich Wolfgang Korngold is best known for his pioneering scores for swashbuckling Hollywood films of the 1930's. But in Germany in 1920, at 24, he was hailed as the brilliant and promising composer of a mysterious opera, ''Die Tote Stadt.'' The New York City Opera has revived its 1975 production of this work, which incorporates film elements, video projections and scrims to evoke the dreamlike story. The cast, though not ideal, is appealing, and George Manahan conducts a sweeping account of Korngold's lyrically sumptuous and theatrical music. At 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $125. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>'VIOLET FIRE' (Wednesday) Jon Gibson, best known as an early and steadfast member of the Philip Glass Ensemble, has created this multimedia opera about Nikola Tesla, the early-20th-century scientist and inventor who made early breakthroughs in radio broadcasting, electricity and robotics. Miriam Seidel wrote the libretto, and Terry O'Reilly (a director of the Mabou Mines theater company) directs the impressionistic staging. At 7:30 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $20 to $40. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>'DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE' (Tonight) The revival of Julie Taymor's production of Mozart's ''Zauberflöte'' is under way at the Metropolitan Opera, complete with the magical puppets and stage effects that made it an audience hit when it opened in 2004. Isabel Bayrakdarian, who sings with a clear, bright, expressive soprano, is a radiant and believable Pamina, and Nathan Gunn uses his vibrant baritone and dramatic energy to create an instantly appealing Papageno. Their charisma somewhat overshadows Jonas Kaufmann as Tamino. At 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $320. (Vivien Schweitzer)</p>
        <p>Classical Music</p>
        <p>* AMERICAN COMPOSERS ORCHESTRA (Tonight) This orchestra opens its season with the world premieres of Michael Gantonska's ''After the Wings of Migratory Birds,'' Evan Ziporyn's ''Big Grenadilla,'' Brad Lubman's ''Fuzzy Logic'' and Corey Dargel's ''All the Notes and Rhythms I've Ever Loved.'' Also on the program are recent works by Michael Gandolfi and Susie Ibarra, and an oldie -- O.K., an American classic -- by Charles Ives. At 7:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $32 and $40. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>APOLLO'S FIRE BAROQUE ORCHESTRA (Thursday) ''Bach in Context'' is the title of the Miller Theater series, and this installment contextualizes Johann Sebastian by presenting him in tandem with his friend and rival Telemann, and letting the audience judge between them. The news is the New York debut of the renowned, Cleveland-based and reportedly excellent baroque orchestra Apollo's Fire. At 8 p.m., Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com; $35; $15 for students. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>CAPPELLA ANDREA BARCA (Wednesday and Thursday) The estimable Hungarian pianist Andras Schiff brings his cutely named ensemble to Alice Tully Hall for two all-Mozart programs. At 8 p.m., Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $30 to $56. (Holland)</p>
        <p>* LEON FLEISHER (Thursday) After a neurological condition rendered his right hand nearly useless more than 40 years ago, the pianist Leon Fleisher, now 78, spent years performing only left-hand repertory. But thanks to new treatments, he has been making a remarkable comeback. His Carnegie Hall recital features some works from his new CD, ''Leon Fleisher: The Journey'' (Vangard Classics), including Bach's ''Capriccio on the Departure of His Most Dearly Beloved Brother'' and Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue in D minor (BWV 903) and Stravinsky's Serenade in A. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $26 to $88. (Schweitzer)</p>
        <p>ANNE-MARIE MCDERMOTT (Thursday) Ms. McDermott, one of New York's more interesting pianists and musicians, has a go at Bach's ''Goldberg'' Variations. At 10:30 p.m., Kaplan Penthouse, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $30. (Holland)</p>
        <p>MET CHAMBER ENSEMBLE (Sunday) A new piece by the unquenchable Elliott Carter called ''In the Distances of Sleep'' will be offered by this adventurous and accomplished offshoot of James Levine's Metropolitan Opera Orchestra. The program includes Mozart's G Minor Piano Quartet and the Mendelssohn Octet. At 5 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $58 and $68. (Holland)</p>
        <p>NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tomorrow and Thursday) The Philharmonic's Young People's Concerts may not have the high profile that Leonard Bernstein once brought to them, but they tend to be well-planned and engaging. Tomorrow Delta David Gier conducts ''The Ages of Music: Baroque,'' the first in a series of programs that will survey music history. On the regular subscription series this week the brilliant American conductor David Robertson leads works by Stravinsky and Mozart, including a violin concerto by each, with Gil Shaham as soloist. Then on Thursday Avery Fisher Hall becomes a movie palace when the dynamic young Xian Zhang conducts Prokofiev's pulsating score for Sergei Eisenstein's epic film ''Alexander Nevsky'' (1938), while that cinematic masterpiece is screened. Don't bring popcorn. Today at 11 a.m., tomorrow at 2 (Young People's Concert) and 8 p.m., and Tuesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $24 to $96; remaining tickets for the Young People's Concert are $8 to $24.

        <p>'PROMENADE CONCERT' (Tonight) The ever-inventive George Steel has assembled a program of rarities, both light and serious, in the tradition of the popular (and popularly priced) Promenades concerts. For the occasion, Mr. Steel is conducting the Vox Vocal Ensemble and the Gotham City Orchestra, with Tiffany Jackson, soprano, and Alexandra Cooke, mezzo-soprano. The program includes music by Lalo, Gounod, Chabrier, Villette, Schmitt and Messiaen. At 8, Riverside Church, Riverside Drive at 122nd Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com; $10. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>STEVE REICH TRIBUTE (Sunday) As part of its celebration of Steve Reich's 70th birthday, the Whitney Museum has assembled a four-hour concert of his music and the works of younger composers whose music he influenced. The selections run from Mr. Reich's early phase piece ''It's Gonna Rain'' (1965), through his classic scores of the 1970's and 80's (among them ''Clapping Music,'' ''Music for Mallet Instruments, Voice and Organ'' and ''Vermont Counterpoint'') and more recent works. The performers include several superb new-music bands -- Alarm Will Sound, the Prism Saxophone Quartet, So Percussion and Tactus -- as well as the flutist and conductor Ransom Wilson, and the guitarist Lee Ranaldo, of Sonic Youth. At 2 p.m., 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639, whitney.org; free with admission to the museum, which is $15; $10 for students and 62+. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>MAXIM VENGEROV (Tomorrow) This popular violin virtuoso joins Alisa Weilerstein, a cellist, and Lilya Silberstein, a pianist, in trios by Shostakovich and Tchaikovsky. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $31 to $100. (Holland)</p>
        <p>WESTMINISTER CATHEDRAL CHOIR (Tuesday) This choir will perform choral works from the Renaissance to the 20th century. The lineup includes music by Christopher Tye, William Byrd, Arvo Pärt and Marcel Dupré. It also features ''Ave Maria'' by Bruckner.

        <p>* PIETER WISPELWEY (Sunday) Beethoven's complete works for cello and piano have increasingly shown themselves to be a fine large-scale concert for a gifted cellist. Now taking on the corpus -- five sonatas and three sets of variations, with two intermissions -- is this Dutch cellist, whose last cycles in New York have been of the Bach suites.

        <p>COMPLEXIONS (Tomorrow and Sunday) This group, formed by Dwight Rhoden and Desmond Richardson, is known for attracting superb dancers who tend to be stronger than the choreography on offer. That may not be true this time, since the troupe is presenting Ulysses Dove's rarely seen ''Dancing on the Front Porch of Heaven,'' originally choreographed for the Royal Swedish Ballet. Also on the program is a new work, ''Hissy Fits,'' by Mr. Rhoden, and an excerpt from his hyperactive ''Anthem.''

        <p>* GARTH FAGAN DANCE (Tuesday through Thursday) Garth Fagan's limpid, calligraphic dances will include a world premiere during this one-week run at the Joyce. Among other pieces from Mr. Fagan's repertory is last year's very briefly seen ''Life: Dark/Light,'' to the jazz violinist Billy Bang's ''Vietnam: The Aftermath.'' (Through Oct. 22.) Tuesday and Wednesday at 7.30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800; $42. (Sulcas)</p>
        <p>HENNING RUBSAM'S SENSEDANCE (Thursday) A new work, ''Merciless Beauty,'' from the German-born, New York City-based Mr. Rubsam, who works mostly in a balletic idiom but also draws from the worlds of jazz and social dance. His work can be uneven but almost always holds rewards. (Through Oct. 22.) At 8 p.m., Joyce Soho, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 334-7479; $25; artists and students, $15. (Sulcas)</p>
        <p>* SYLVIE GUILLEM AND RUSSELL MALIPHANT (Tonight through Sunday) This star French ballerina, now segueing into modern dance, joins forces with the British dancer and choreographer Russell Maliphant for a four-part program called ''Push,'' the first result of the newly announced collaboration between City Center and the Sadler's Wells Theater in London. There will be two Guillem solos, one Maliphant solo and a duet. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 3 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org; $35 to $85. (Rockwell)</p>
        <p>RENNIE HARRIS (Tonight) Mr. Harris blends hip-hop poetry, rap music and movement and traditional African dance in ''Prince ScareKrow's Road to the Emerald City.'' A preview of the work is part of the Impact Festival, which focuses on human rights, social justice and political activism. At 8, Schimmel Center for the Arts, Pace University, 3 Spruce Street, between Park Row and Gold Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 253-7017, theatermania.com; $15 to $35. (Dunning)</p>

Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 3 p.m., Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, TriBeCa, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com and dnadance.org; $17. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>* SARAH MICHELSON (Wednesday and Thursday) This star of downtown experimental modern dance gets her big Next Wave festival break with four performances of a piece called ''Dogs,'' commissioned by the Brooklyn Academy of Music and designed for its Harvey Theater space. (Through Oct. 21.) At 7:30 p.m., Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $20 to $40. (Rockwell)</p>

At 8 p.m., Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, TriBeCa, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com and dnadance.org; $17. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>'PEAK PERFORMANCES' (Thursday) This series aims to provoke, and its choice, Jan Fabre, is said to be a first-rate provocateur. His new ''Quando l'uomo principale e una donna'' (''When the Leading Man Turns Out to Be a Woman'') is an homage to Yves Klein, who used nude women as paintbrushes. Mr. Fabre takes things further by coating the stage floor with olive oil. (Through Oct. 21.) At 7:30 p.m., Alexander Kasser Theater, Montclair State University, Normal Avenue, Montclair, (973) 655-5112, peakperfs.org; $35. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>STEPHEN PETRONIO AND RACOCO PRODUCTIONS (Tomorrow and Thursday) Mr. Petronio and his quicksilver choreography company are featured tomorrow in the Dance at the Winter Garden series.

Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Thursday at 12:30 p.m., World Financial Center, 220 Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505, stephenpetronio.com, racoco.org; free. (Dunning)</p>

        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'A DEAF ARTIST IN EARLY AMERICA: THE WORLDS OF JOHN BREWSTER JR.,' through Jan. 7. Few early American artists painted more incisive and empathetic likenesses than John Brewster Jr. (1766-1854), the subject of a fine traveling show at the American Folk Art Museum. And few worked under such potentially limiting circumstances: Brewster was born deaf before remedial help or a common signing language existed. The case the show makes for Brewster's physical condition's being reflected in his art is inconclusive, but the paintings are wonderful. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Holland Cotter)</p>
        <p>* ASIA SOCIETY: 'GILDED SPLENDOR: TREASURES OF CHINA'S LIAO EMPIRE (907-1125),' through Dec. 31. For a thousand years the Khitan, who established the Liao Empire, were dismissed by Chinese historians, but they have been redeemed by late-20th-century archaeological discoveries. The evidence is laid out in this show of more than 200 objects excavated from tombs, temples and walled cities in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China. The first major display of Liao objects outside China, the show gives the lie to the Khitan as cultural nobodies. .Ceramics, wood carvings, painted screens and belts; bronze mirrors that studded the outside of the White Pagoda; writing instruments; and even an ancient spittoon add to the bite and flavor of this show. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Grace Glueck)</p>
        <p>* FRICK COLLECTION: 'CIMABUE AND EARLY ITALIAN DEVOTIONAL PAINTING,' through Dec. 31. Weighing in at six works of art, with about 20 images among them, this is one of the most stupendous very small exhibitions most of us are likely to see. It reunites two small, beautiful, newly attributed panels by the Italian master Cimabue, whose turn toward naturalism increased the sense of space, gesture and feeling in Florentine painting, and helped set the Renaissance in motion. The panels, which depict a Virgin and Child Enthroned and a Flagellation and may be from the same altarpiece, are flanked by related works. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Roberta Smith)</p>
        <p>* METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'BRUSH AND INK: THE CHINESE ART OF WRITING,' through Jan. 21. If painting and writing can be seen as modes of thinking, and they can, then this exhibition is as much a brainstorming session as an art exhibition, crackling with ideas and arguments every step of the way. It is also a sequence of moods, with impassioned voices calling out from the 80 scrolls and inscribed fans that line the galleries, which include colossal examples of contemporary 21st-century art that both depart from and preserve a tradition, (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>* THE MET: 'SEAN SCULLY: WALL OF LIGHT,' through Jan. 15. The capacious, day-lighted mezzanine galleries at the Met are the perfect setting for Sean Scully's bold and energizing ''Wall of Light'' paintings from the series he started in 1998. These large-scale oils on canvas wow the viewer with their scale, intensity of color and sheer dominance of space. All have this in common: They are richly painted surfaces of close-laid vertical and horizontal bars (he calls them bricks) whose arrangement suggests constructed walls of stone. Although they appear totally abstract, with their all-over arrangements of bars that superficially vary only in color, size and juxtaposition, they evoke landscapes, people, events, the work of other artists. (See above.) (Glueck)</p>
        <p>* NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: LEGACIES: CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS REFLECT ON SLAVERY, through Jan. 7. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the 1960's, a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>RUBIN MUSEUM OF ART: 'I SEE NO STRANGER: EARLY SIKH ART AND DEVOTION,' through Jan. 29. Sikhism is the world's fifth-largest organized religion, but how many Westerners know that it was conceived as universalist in scope and radically egalitarian socially? Or that its holy book, far from being a catalog of sectarian dos and don'ts, is a bouquet of poetic songs blending the fragrances of Hindu ragas, Muslim hymns, and Punjabi folk tunes? This is precisely the information delivered by this small and beautiful show. Vivid and concentrated, it presents, mostly through miniature paintings, a kind of Sikh self-portrait, the image of a history shaped by hard work, pluralism and mystical transport, as well as by militancy. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>* THE WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: MARK GROTJAHN, through Jan. 7. Mining the early Modernist cusp where the figurative, the geometric, the spatial and the visionary still remain tangled, this Los-Angeles-based painter deploys his abstract pinwheel motifs on paper in eight brash, door-sized drawings. Multiple vanishing points destabilize radiating compositions that are variously Op and buzzy, darkly monochrome (and a little too pretentiously moody) or candy-color bright. In some works the motif is doubled and angled, decreasing the shield-like frontality and opening up new optical and spatial possibilities. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)</p>
        <p>THE WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'PICASSO AND AMERICAN ART,' through Jan. 28. Despite the glamorous pictures in it, this is one of those dull affairs incubated in the world of academe: a walk-through slide show that states the obvious. Picasso's ''Woman in White,'' a picture of heavenly arrogance, hangs between Arshile Gorky's ''Artist and His Mother'' and de Kooning's ''Standing Man,'' terrific paintings too. We are meant to register the plain insinuation of Picasso's neo-Classicism, then move on. Next slide, please. The show ends with a virtual retrospective of Picasso-inspired works by Jasper Johns. In picture after picture, Johns buries allusions to the great Spaniard, aspiring presumably to Picasso's own late meditations on Velázquez. Except that even when he was old and running out of steam, Picasso still had joie de vivre. Johns doesn't so much enthrone Picasso as repeatedly entomb him. See above. (Michael Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>DONA NELSON The painter Dona Nelson is in midcareer, and her work process is more experimental than ever, on the evidence of the four large pieces in this show. One is made with layers of hosed-down pigment; another is festooned with ropes of stiffened cloth; a third is a rubbing from an earlier painting; a fourth is reversible. In messing around with form, Ms. Nelson lets beauty fall where it may, which makes her art feel exciting and awake. Thomas Erben Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, fourth floor, (212) 645-8701, thomaserben.com, through Oct. 21. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>DARIO ROBLETO: 'FEAR AND TENDERNESS IN MEN' Minus the checklist, these works come across as mawkish facsimiles of conventional 20th-century assemblage, 19th-century funeral wreaths, homemade reliquaries or folk art. Their impact expands as you read the lists of materials involved: all kinds of artifacts of American wars, from shrapnel and battlefield dirt to soldiers' letters used to make pulp. But it all remains too visually inaccessible, in addition to being a bit presumptuous about the keepsakes of people no longer alive. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-9460, through Oct. 28. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>BARD GRADUATE CENTER: 'LIONS, DRAGONS AND OTHER BEASTS: AQUAMANILIA OF THE MIDDLE AGES, VESSELS FOR CHURCH AND TABLE'  Aquamanilia sounds like the latest perfume or sorbet but actually refers to the small, cunningly figurative medieval vessels used for ritual hand washing. Cast in sturdy, glowing copper alloy, most often in the form of lions with serpents on their backs, aquamanilia are now having their first exhibition, complete with lavish catalog. The show feels like a walk-in bestiary and is enhanced by striking abbreviations reminiscent of folk art. Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design and Culture, 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000, bgc.bard.edu; closes on Sunday. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* GERALD DAVIS Growing up can be hell, especially if you're an art-loving sissy. This is more or less the story told by Mr. Davis's auspicious New York solo debut. The show is titled ''1986,'' for the year the artist entered his teens, and in several polished autobiographical drawings it illustrates a state of social and psychological crisis already in progress. John Connelly Presents, 625 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 337-9563; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>TOMOO GOKITA: DRUNKO A whiz at drawing, this Tokyo-based artist is making his New York solo debut with a show of his first paintings, executed in black and white gouache on canvas. ATM Gallery, 619 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 375-0349, atmgallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>ALICE KÖNTIZ Ambiguity is the thread in this compact show. Its various small sculptures do double duty as furniture, specifically as supports for other art. Formally, each piece looks at once designer-chic and job lot cheap. The gallery installation could be either a showroom or a living room. Or both, which is the point. Hudson Franklin, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-1189; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>ADAM MCEWEN Most of the more interesting artists these days work in several media and tend to approach ideas at a slant. The British-born Adam McEwen qualifies on both counts in a solo show of abstract paintings made with chewing gum and photographs of an apartment complex in Queens. Nicole Klagsbrun, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 243-3335, closes tomorrow. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>TAYLOR MCKIMENS: 'THE DRIPS' In his second show this artist continues to make highly effective full-scale figures and installations that seem to have escaped from a comic book, which they have. His vision of down-and-out America has intensified and is now dominated by oozing, hairy, often faceless blobs called the Drips. Clementine, 623 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-5937; closes tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* RIVANE NEUENSCHWANDER: 'OTHER STORIES AND STORIES OF OTHERS' The New York gallery debut of this Brazilian artist is beautifully in step with the somewhat pious trend of making art out of almost nothing to circumvent the big, bad art market. In video, collages and typewriter drawings, randomness rules, and the centerpiece makes everyday magic from fans and bushels of bright tissue-paper circles. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-4144, tanyabonakdargallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* SARA VANDERBEEK: 'MIRROR IN THE SKY' Ranging through 20th-century culture, this talented artist pushes set-up photography and photo appropriation in directions at once worldly and highly personal. By building, lighting and photographing little stage-set constructions festooned with cut-out images, buttons, beads, trinkets and sometimes glitter, she creates poetic, strange amalgams of sculpture, collage and photo montage, and cuts Modernism down to size. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-9460; closes tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>WALLPAPER LAB In this show 15 artists (including Douglas Gordon, Gary Simmons, Fred Tomaselli and Phoebe Washburn) adapt their art to the wallpaper format. The results vary tremendously, but it is always interesting to see how artistic ideas translate from one medium to another. Lennon, Weinberg, 514 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 941-0012; closes tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>AARON YOUNG Before the opening of this show, Mr. Young hired a biker to rev up in the gallery and lay down DeKooningesque tracks of burnt rubber. He also installed painted bronze casts of street curbing and invited skateboarders to perform on them until some of the paint wore off and the gold-colored metal came through. Four ''trick,'' audience-participation paintings hang in the back gallery. Harris Lieberman, 89 Vandam Street, between Hudson and Greenwich Streets, South Village, (212) 206-1290; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>'ZOO STORY' A clay gorilla by Daisy Youngblood, a bronze she-wolf by Kiki Smith, a flock of concrete sheep by Françoise-Xavier Lalanne and works about animals by more than 20 other artists, including John Baldessari and Katharina Fritsch, turn the first floor of this sleek, three-story private museum into a diverting menagerie. Fisher Landau Center for Art, 38-27 30th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-0727, flcart.org; closes on Monday. (Ken Johnson)</p>

        <p>'THE TIMES THEY ARE A-CHANGIN' ' In previews; opens on Oct. 26. Bob Dylan has come back in vogue just in time for his Broadway show, staged by Twyla Tharp (1:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100.</p>
        <p>'THE VOYAGE OF THE CARCASS' In previews; opens on Monday. Dan Fogler (''The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee'') plays one of the three surviving members of the SS Carcass. Or is he just an actor in a play within a play (2:30)? SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1515.</p>
        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE'  (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'JAY JOHNSON: THE TWO AND ONLY' A genial 90-minute entertainment giving Broadway audiences a chance to get reacquainted with the (almost) lost art of ventriloquism. Jay Johnson, the onetime star of the television comedy ''Soap,'' gives a pocket history of the profession, in addition to an ample demonstration, with partners that include a vulture who sings ''My Way,'' a foul-mouthed wooden tyke, a talking tennis ball and a monkey purveying some of the corniest shtick this side of a Friar's roast (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Charles Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'JERSEY BOYS'  (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped biomusical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'TARZAN'  This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE WEDDING SINGER'  An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Constantine Maroulis, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'ARMS AND THE MAN' Shaw's story of a mercenary who breaks into a young Bulgarian woman's bedroom while fleeing a battle seems not to have much social bite in this rendition, but the humor still works nicely, particularly when in the hands of Robin Leslie Brown and Dominic Cuskern as the invaded household's matriarch and patriarch. Bradford Cover has an appealing offhand delivery as the soldier (2:15). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Neil Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>'BIRTH AND AFTER BIRTH' Baby is a bruiser in Tina Howe's self-conscious foray into the jungles of absurdism. Written in 1972, this explosion of the nuclear family appears to be stepping, with cautious exactitude, in the footprints of early Edward Albee. Christian Parker directed the rather stilted cast (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'BLUE DOOR' An African-American math professor struggles to reconnect to his cultural past in this small but densely packed new play by Tanya Barfield. Reg E. Cathey is the math prof, abandoned by his wife and visited by the ghosts of his ancestors, all played by the vibrant young actor Andre Holland (1:35). Playwrights Horizons, Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'BUSH IS BAD: IMPEACHMENT EDITION' A musical revue of silly, heavy-handed sketches aimed at Bush-haters (1:30). Triad Theater, 158 West 72nd Street, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'DRUG BUDDY'  The aimless Texas drug dealers of David Folwell's slight slacker dramedy are one losers' club we wouldn't mind spending more time with, particularly the engaging lead, Matthew Stadelmann. But ''Drug Buddy'' leaves barely a bruise, let alone a buzz (51 minutes). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village, (212) 868-4444. (Rob Kendt)</p>
        <p>'ESOTERICA' Eric Walton's very entertaining one-man show is a mix of magic, mentalism and intelligent chat. He does all three impressively (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates)</p>
        <p>'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'GARDEL: THE MUSICAL' A standard-issue biomusical about the tango legend Carlos Gardel that wallows in melodrama (1:30). Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, (212) 225-9920. (Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'JOHN FERGUSON' This 1919 tragedy about a poor Irish family and how far its members will go not to lose their farm is a compelling, fully realized drama with a cast that doesn't miss a beat (2:20). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'KING LEAR' The ''promised end'' comes with disarming swiftness in this Classical Theater of Harlem production, starring André De Shields, which clocks in at just over two hours, not including an intermission. There's nothing distilled about Mr. De Shields's vigorous performance in the title role, but his impressive energy is not always productively channeled, and the supporting cast is uneven (2:10). The Harlem School of the Arts Theater, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'NIXON'S NIXON' Russell Lees's savory political satire takes place on the night before the president announced his resignation. Gerry Bamman and Steve Mellor created the roles of Nixon and Kissinger, respectively, in the original production from 1995, also directed by Jim Simpson, and they return to them with the ease of veteran vaudevillians slipping back into a comfortable partnership (1:30). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'NO CHILD'  Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE'  A slow, airless revival of Jay Presson Allen's 1966 play (adapted from Muriel Spark's novel) about a dangerous Scottish schoolteacher, directed by Scott Elliott and starring the wonderful (but miscast) Cynthia Nixon, who seems much too sane and centered as the deluded Miss Brody. (2:40). The Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'RICHARD II' Michael Cumpsty plays the ineffectual king who loses a crown and gains a soul in Brian Kulick's middling production for the Classic Stage Company. Mr. Cumpsty traces Richard's worldly downfall and spiritual ascent with affecting clarity, but the production is a little glib and a little bland (2:15). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'SHOUT!' A miniskirted, go-go-booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the showroom of a Carnival cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'SONGS OF THE DRAGONS FLYING TO HEAVEN' Young Jean Lee has fashioned a hysterically funny piece of theater with twisted socio-political power and giggly Korean dancers who would fit right into a Quentin Tarantino movie (1:30). Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 868-4444. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'SUBURBIA' This black-hole revival of Eric Bogosian's 1994 group portrait of losers in Angstville, U.S.A., directed by Jo Bonney, features lively performances from Gaby Hoffman, Kieran Culkin and Jessica Capshaw. But even if you're as success-addicted as Donald Trump, you're likely to find yourself identifying with these characters in the wrong way: They're beyond caring what happens to them, and so are you (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)</p>
        <p>* 'THE TOOTH OF CRIME' This highly entertaining revival of Sam Shepard's musical comic-book melodrama about celebrity, mortality and rock 'n' roll may not be the slickest show around. But as directed by George Ferencz, it brings a demystifying clarity to a work often dismissed as a smoky head trip and makes a strong case for ''Tooth'' as one of Mr. Shepard's best plays (2:15). La MaMa Annex, 66 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE TREATMENT' A new play by Eve Ensler (''The Vagina Monologues'') depicting fraught encounters between a traumatized war veteran and a military psychologist. Fervently acted by Dylan McDermott and Portia, it is an overwrought amalgam of psychodrama and political sermonizing (1:05). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983, impactfestival.org. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'WRECKS' The tail wags the scorpion in the latest play by Neil LaBute to be propelled by a poisoned lunch line. This slender, prickly tease of a monologue -- whose whole raison-d'etre is its last-minute revelation -- is given substance by an expert performance by Ed Harris as a newly bereaved widower (1:15). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Off Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'¡EL CONQUISTADOR!' Thaddeus Phillips's one-man show about a hapless Colombian doorman can be slow, but it's also ingenious and an excellent showcase for Mr. Phillips, who would have made a great silent-movie comedian (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'THE THUGS' Rumors of death at a law firm make Adam Bock's new play a chilling little nightmare (1:15). SoHo Rep, 46 Walker Street, between Church Street and Broadway, TriBeCa, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)</p>
        <p>Long-Running Shows</p>
        <p>'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). New World Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)</p>
        <p>'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)</p>
        <p>'SPAMALOT'  A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans. (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>'FOOLS AND LOVERS' The idea itself is questionable: let's make a musical about a chintzy wedding based entirely on Shakespearean texts. And the realization does not improve on the inspiration. Andrew Sherman's music perfectly duplicates the aesthetic of a second-rate wedding band, and to add a layer of realism, many of the actors have trouble carrying a tune. All that the exercise ultimately proves is that you can make Shakespeare say anything (1:20). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444; closing on Sunday. (Anne Midgette)</p>
        <p>'IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING' Bill Bowers's zestful, endearing one-man show is about his life as a mime, an actor and a gay boy growing up in Montana (1:15). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, off Seventh Avenue South, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'THE PAIN AND THE ITCH'  A sharp-elbowed new comedy by Bruce Norris about the indiscreet hypocrisies of the urban liberal bourgeoisie. Some familiar dysfunctions and some more exotic ones disrupt Thanksgiving dinner. Funny but tough to stomach (2:00). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'SISTERS' Declan Hassett's dark tale of sibling rivalry set in rural Ireland occasions the welcome return to the New York stage of Anna Manahan, the Irish actress who won a Tony in 1998 playing the ferociously needy mother in Martin McDonagh's ''Beauty Queen of Leenane.'' A bit less welcome is Mr. Hassett's relentlessly downbeat play itself (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THEOPHILUS NORTH' Matthew Burnett's adaptation of the Thornton Wilder novel about a young man's not quite interpersonal relationships in 1926 Newport is affable if sometimes oversentimental (2:00). Harold Clurman Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes tomorrow. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'WASPS IN BED' This Berkshires-to-bedroom farce would make a clever sitcom, if only the authors would face the fact that it isn't really about sex (1:45). Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Gates)</p>

        <p>'ALL THE KING'S MEN' (PG-13, 120 minutes) This second adaptation of Robert Penn Warren's big novel of political and spiritual corruption in Depression-era Louisiana is full of grand themes, good actors (Jude Law, Sean Penn, Kate Winslet, Mark Ruffalo) and lovingly-photographed southern scenery. And yet nothing seems to work. It's a chaotic stew of ambitions and ideas, but in the end neither convincing nor coherent. (A. O. Scott)</p>
        <p>'THE BLACK DAHLIA' (R, 119 minutes) Brian De Palma drains the life out of James Ellroy's take on the spectacularly cruel 1947 murder of a young Los Angeles woman known as the Black Dahlia. The stars Josh Hartnett, Scarlett Johansson and Aaron Eckhart don't help matters, though Hilary Swank is dandy. (Manohla Dargis)</p>
        <p>'BLACK GOLD' (No rating, 78 minutes, in English, Oromifa and Amharic) This documentary tells an unresolved modern version of the age-old David and Goliath story. The giants in this case are multinational corporations that control the worldwide coffee market. The heroic little guy, Tadesse Meskela, who represents the Oromo Coffee Farmers Co-op Union, devotes himself tirelessly to traveling the world looking for buyers who will pay a fair price for the beans harvested by the country's 70,000 coffee farmers. (Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>'BROKEN SKY' (No rating, 140 minutes, in Spanish) Boy meets boy, as you've never seen, in Julián Hernández's sex-drenched, extravagantly minimalist epic. (Nathan Lee)</p>
        <p>* 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller ''Infernal Affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH' (PG, 103 minutes) A minimum-wage comedy chronicling the romance between a slacker box boy (Dane Cook) and a bodacious cashier (Jessica Simpson) working at a Costco-like megastore. Directed by Greg Coolidge with the creative flair of an entry-level training video, the movie is tireder than a Wal-Mart greeter at the end of a Saturday shift. (Jeannette Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* '49 UP' (No rating, 134 minutes) In the latest installment of documentary cinema's longest-running, most fascinating experiment, the British schoolchildren first interviewed in ''7 Up'' (1964) have settled into middle age. As always, there are quiet revelations and surprises, and ordinary human experience somehow becomes more fascinating and mysterious than any other subject. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'FLYBOYS' (PG-13, 129 minutes) Empty-headed and egregiously polite, this nostalgia trip to World War I is what you'd get if Norman Rockwell directed ''Top Gun.'' (Lee)</p>
        <p>'GRIDIRON GANG' (PG-13, 120 minutes) Set in a California juvenile detention center, ''Gridiron Gang'' stars Dwayne Johnson, best known as the Rock, as Sean Porter, the real-life probation officer who fights recidivism with football. Jumping from heartwarming to murderous, this is a sports-as-rehab movie that wants to have its gangbanging and cure it, too. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'A GUIDE TO RECOGNIZING YOUR SAINTS' (R, 98 minutes) Rough, ragged and full of life, this autobiographical movie, written and directed by Dito Montiel, about his youth on the streets of Astoria, Queens, is a remarkable debut, stuffed almost to bursting with bold performances and operatic emotions. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'THE GUARDIAN' (PG-13, 139 minutes) A veteran Coast Guard rescue swimmer (Kevin Costner) mentors a young hotshot swimming champion (Ashton Kutcher) in this predictable, overly long but nonetheless serviceable tribute to a branch of the United States military that has been somewhat neglected in the movies. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'THE ILLUSIONIST' (PG-13, 109 minutes) This film tells the story of Eisenheim (Edward Norton), a fictional conjurer who enraptured Viennese audiences in 1900 with his supernatural magic shows. A terrific yarn, it rouses your slumbering belief in the miraculous. (Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'INVINCIBLE' (PG, 99 minutes) The latest addition to the Disney stable of sports-underdog movies, ''Invincible'' is the true story of Vince Papale (Mark Wahlberg), a substitute teacher and part-time bartender, who in 1976 realizes his dream of playing for the Philadelphia Eagles. The director and cinematographer, Ericson Core, counters the story's predictably inspirational trajectory with close attention to historical detail and blue-collar hardship. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'JACKASS: NUMBER TWO' (R, 92 minutes) Debased, infantile and reckless in the extreme, this compendium of body bravado and malfunction makes for some of the most fearless, liberated and cathartic comedy in modern movies. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'JET LI'S FEARLESS' (PG-13, 105 minutes, in Mandarin) Jet Li says goodbye (supposedly) to the martial arts genre with this decent blend of old-school chopsocky and new-school superproduction. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'KETTLE OF FISH' (R, 93 minutes) Casting Gina Gershon as a mousy scientist (yeah, right) is the first mistake, though by no means the last, in this deeply misguided romantic comedy. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker plays the mad king, while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'THE LAST KISS' (R, 104 minutes) Tony Goldwyn's remake of a popular Italian film is thin and clumsy, but nonetheless unusually candid in its treatment of human sexual misbehavior. Zach Braff plays a young man who, on the brink of turning 30 and about to become a father, panics and cheats on his girlfriend (Jacinda Barrett). (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'OPEN SEASON' (PG, 100 minutes) In this grand-scale animated comedy-adventure about a grizzly bear and a mule deer who assemble an oddball army of animals to fight the hunters, periodic bursts of cleverness and eye-popping imagery, further enhanced in the 3-D IMAX version, can't disguise that it's just another movie full of jive-talking computer-generated animals with little new to say. (Laura Kern)</p>
        <p>* 'OUT OF PLACE: MEMORIES OF EDWARD SAID' and 'EDWARD SAID: THE LAST INTERVIEW' (No rating, 138 minutes and 114 minutes, in English, Arabic and Hebrew) Two documentaries about the Palestinian writer and thinker Edward Said explore his life, his chronic alienation and his sympathy for the Palestinian cause. Loosely framed by readings from Mr. Said's 1999 memoir of the same title, ''Out of Place: Memories of Edward Said'' is less a biography than a rambling meditation on exile, identity and the psychological scars of dispossession. More satisfying is the complex portrait provided by ''Edward Said: The Last Interview,'' a riveting record of Mr. Said's 2002 conversation with the journalist Charles Glass. Engrossing and wide-ranging, the film proves that a couch, a camera and a great mind can be all the inspiration a filmmaker needs. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'THE QUEEN' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Directed by Stephen Frears from a very smart script by Peter Morgan, and starring a magnificent Helen Mirren in the title role, ''The Queen'' pries open a window in the House of Windsor around the time of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, blending fact with fiction. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'SCHOOL FOR SCOUNDRELS' (PG-13, 101 minutes) Billy Bob Thornton stars as an alpha scoundrel who runs a self-improvement course for sad sacks of the sort persuasively played by the film's other lead actor, Jon Heder. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'THE SCIENCE OF SLEEP' (R, 106 minutes, in English, French and Spanish) A bittersweet dream of romance from Michel Gondry. Inventive and enchanting. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'SHORTBUS' (No rating, 102 minutes) John Cameron Mitchell's ode to the joy and sweet release of sex also manages to be a sincere, modest political venture that finds humor where you might least expect it. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE: THE BEGINNING' (R, 84 minutes) A prequel to a remake of a 1974 movie that spawned several sequels and numberless copycats, this hateful trash begs the question: how many chainsaw massacres can one state possibly contain? (Lee)</p>
        <p>'WRESTLING WITH ANGELS: PLAYWRIGHT TONY KUSHNER' (No rating, 98 minutes) In this entertaining but shallow documentary portrait of the playwright Tony Kushner, its likable subject contradicts the cliché image of the left-wing intellectual as a grim, preachy commissar of political correctness. He comes across as a welcoming public figure who has a gift for being very funny and serious at the same time. (Holden)</p>

The film, about Washingtonians who maneuver, stars Henry Fonda and a scene-stealing Charles Laughton. Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates)</p>

        <p>ART BRUT (Wednesday and Thursday) Rock 'n' roll needs to celebrate as well as ridicule its own mythology, and Art Brut, sarcastically but exuberantly singing about the thrill of plugging in and making a ruckus -- ''Formed a band, we formed a band/Look at us, we formed a band!'' -- is one of the rare groups that can do both. With Spinto Band. Wednesday at 8 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; $17.50 in advance, $19 at the door.

        <p>BECK (Wednesday) Since he broke through with the slacker anthem ''Loser'' in 1994, Beck has waffled between snidely ironic hip-hop pastiche and glum acoustic balladry. His latest, ''The Information'' (Interscope), is in the hip-hop category, with the kind of pop-culture crazy-quilt lyrics that only Beck could come up with: ''I got a silicon Bible song/Paranoid Jumbotron.'' With Spank Rock. At 8 p.m., the Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $54.50. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* CBGB (Tonight through Sunday) The clock is ticking for CBGB, the storied Bowery dive that in the 1970's incubated New York's greatest generation of punk rock. The club must close by the end of the month, and the shows this weekend have been billed as its last. The Dictators, whose muscular three-chord chants are paragons of tidy melody and obnoxious humor, play tonight and tomorrow night. Also tomorrow, Debbie Harry and Chris Stein of Blondie offer an acoustic set. Sunday night is the big blowout with Patti Smith and her band. At 8 p.m., 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052, cbgb.com; sold out. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>C. J. CHENIER (Sunday) The son of Clifton Chenier, who was the undisputed king of zydeco, C. J. Chenier picked up his father's accordion and his Red Hot Louisiana Band in the 1980's, carrying on the family tradition of bayou dance music laced with blues. At 7:30 p.m., with a free dance lesson at 6:30, Connolly's, 121 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-7597, letszydeco.com; $22. (Jon Pareles)</p>
        <p>DIRTY DOZEN BRASS BAND (Tonight) The magnificent ensemble that revitalized New Orleans brass-band music. It swaggers through the city's whole musical heritage: parades, rumba, swing, bebop and modern jazz, for starters. Solos can head for the far side of tonality, but the band never loses touch with gutbucket, danceable funk. At 11, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $19. (Pareles)</p>

At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $32 in advance, $35 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>DUB TRIO (Thursday) Made up of well-traveled session players for the likes of the Fugees and Mos Def, Dub Trio plays spacious reggae grooves spiked with high-adrenaline punk, affectionately recalling Bad Brains. At 8 and 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; $10 a set. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>VINCE GILL (Monday) This sweet-voiced country classicist is touring with a 17-piece band and an especially big addition to his repertory: on Tuesday he will release ''These Days'' (MCA Nashville), a four-CD set of all new material, featuring Sheryl Crow, Bonnie Raitt, Michael McDonald, Gretchen Wilson, LeAnn Rimes and enough other stars to fill a downtown Nashville honky-tonk. At 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; $35 to $50. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>GOLDFRAPP (Wednesday) Led by Allison Goldfrapp, a techno glamourpuss part Marlene Dietrich and part Debbie Harry, this British duo plays cool, vaguely futuristic electronica. At 7:30 p.m., Roseland, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $30 in advance, $34 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>JOLIE HOLLAND (Wednesday) With a playful quiver of a voice that can make her resemble a countryfied Billie Holliday, and a junk-shop aesthetic that mingles brassy swing with Appalachian folk, Ms. Holland sings charming, deceptively childlike songs: ''Crush in the Ghetto,'' on her new album, ''Springtime Can Kill You'' (Anti-), finds her overdressed on a bus ride home from a one-night stand. With David Dondero. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>INDIGO GIRLS (Tonight) Guitar strumming, close harmonies, coffeehouse earnestness and songs about the perpetual struggle for love, self-affirmation and a clear conscience have made the duo of Emily Saliers and Amy Ray perennials for the collegiate at heart. With Roman Candle. At 8, Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $30 and $40. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>* LADYSMITH BLACK MAMBAZO (Tuesday) This great South African vocal group, which introduced so much of the world to close, bass-heavy Zulu harmony on Paul Simon's ''Graceland,'' is at Carnegie Hall for the first time since appearing with Mr. Simon there 19 years ago.

        <p>JENNY LEWIS (Tonight) Already the sad-eyed, short-skirted princess of indie rock as the lead singer of Rilo Kiley, Jenny Lewis made an inspired step with her first solo album, whose luscious country-gospel ruminations of romantic and spiritual doubt (''It's not that I believe in your almighty/But I might as well as insurance or bail'') made her its Dusty Springfield as well. At 8, Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, the-townhall-nyc.org; $25. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>PET SHOP BOYS (Tomorrow) The British duo that perfected the pouty and aloof techno-pop of Human League returned this year with ''Fundamental'' (Capitol), a reunion with Trevor Horn, one of its 1980's producers. Only the Pet Shop Boys can sing jabberwocky lines like ''I thought I heard a train/Down in the cemetery/Cellophane'' and make them sound sexy and evil. At 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $29.50 to $99.50. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>RASCAL FLATTS (Tomorrow) The sweetest, most tooth-rotting bubblegum is always the best. This pop-country trio -- big emphasis on pop -- specializes in a kind of mawkish sentimentality that has to be admired for sheer shamelessness, as in ''Skin (Sarabeth),'' an after-school special with a waltz beat about a girl with leukemia: ''It would be a mistake/For someone to take/A girl with no hair to the prom.'' (Her date shaves his head in sympathy.) At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $44.50 to $84.50. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS, MARS VOLTA (Tuesday and Wednesday) Though their transformation from sex-mad punk-funk pranksters to crooning penitents is pretty much complete, the Red Hot Chili Peppers are not above the occasional appearance dressed only in tube socks (not on their feet). With the Mars Volta, leaders of the unlikely renaissance of byzantine prog-metal. At 8 p.m., Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900, meadowlands.com; $63. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>ROYAL DRUMMERS OF BURUNDI (Tomorrow and Monday) First heard by most Western listeners as the spooky, lusty pulse on Joni Mitchell's 1975 album ''The Hissing of Summer Lawns,'' these musicians and dancers -- who sometimes call themselves the Master Drummers of Burundi, or simply the Drummers of Burundi -- conjure an elemental musical force through ritualized unison percussion. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Grace Rainey Rodgers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $50. Sunday at 3 p.m., Lehman Center for the Performing Arts, 250 Bedford Park Boulevard West, at Goulden Avenue, Bedford Park, the Bronx, (718) 960-8833, lehmancenter.org; $20 to $35. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>EARL SCRUGGS (Tonight) Bluegrass banjo as we know it simply would not exist without Earl Scruggs, who joined Bill Monroe's Blue Grass Boys in 1945 and proceeded to revolutionize banjo playing with a three-finger picking style that accelerates to ballistic speeds. At 7:45 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $40. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>ANOUSHKA SHANKAR (Thursday) The sitarist Anoushka Shankar, who has up to this point been an aesthetic acolyte of her father's lithe, neo-traditional take on improvisatory raga, has recently been experimenting with a combination of acoustic and electronic backing instrumentation. At 8 p.m., Grace Rainey Rodgers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $55. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>SOCIAL DISTORTION (Tonight) Formed in 1978 by its songwriter, Mike Ness, Social Distortion plays punk-rock with a roots-rock twang. In his songs Mr. Ness is still trying to figure out the meaning of life, chronicling everything from anti-fashion stubbornness to feeling his age. At 8:30, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>* 'THE SPIRIT OF FÈS' (Tomorrow) The Festival of Sacred Music in Fès, Morocco, is the inspiration for this ecumenical concert. It includes Daqqa Roudania, a group from Morocco, performing ecstatic, percussion-driven Sufi music and dance; Gerard Edery singing Sephardic songs that hark back to Renaissance music; Susan Hellauer from Anonymous 4, singing Gregorian chant; the South Indian classical singer Aruna Sairam, with Hindu devotional music; and Arabic music from Zafer Tawil, playing oud and violin, and Jamey Haddad on percussion. At 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $30 and $42. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>ELAINE STRITCH (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) The third autobiographical go-round by this feisty 81-year-old legend features 10 astutely chosen new songs (including the theme from ''The Sopranos'') performed with verve and humor. But her between-song patter finds her at a loss to come up with amusing or enlightening new stories from her glittering show business life. At 8:45 p.m., Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $125; dinner required. (Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>TILLY AND THE WALL (Tuesday) An indie-rock band playing tuneful, yearning anthems of sexuality and confusion is nothing new, but this Omaha quintet has one truly unusual (and effective) gimmick: the percussion comes from the manic tap-dancing of one of its members, Jamie Williams. With Northern State. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>TV ON THE RADIO (Tuesday and Wednesday) One of Brooklyn's most consistently intriguing bands, TV on the Radio casts a dark and seductive spell with swirling electronics, washes of Pixies-esque guitar and, most alluringly, vocals that draw from both early Peter Gabriel and doo-wop. With Grizzly Bear. At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>YOU AM I (Wednesday and Thursday) With its exhilarating rave-ups and Tim Rogers's windmill guitar slashes -- both recalling the best of the Who -- You Am I is one of the most exciting bands to come out of Australia in a decade, though it has struggled for recognition here. At 9 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $15. (Sisario)</p>

        <p>Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.</p>
        <p>* SATHIMA BEA BENJAMIN (Tuesday) As a singer, Ms. Benjamin shines on standards without forsaking her South African heritage, a subtle achievement represented on a career-spanning new compilation called ''Song Spirit'' (Ekapa). She performs here in celebration of her 70th birthday, with instrumental support from the pianist Onaje Allan Gumbs, the bassist Buster Williams and the drummer Victor Lewis. At 8 and 9:30 p.m., Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626, sweetrhythmny.com; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Nate Chinen)</p>
        <p>CHRIS BOTTI/JOHN PIZZARELLI (Tonight) Mr. Botti has emerged as the lite-jazz hero of our time, a trumpeter whose photogenic presence and brooding sensuality both suit the current notion of the standard songbook as a lifestyle accessory. His low-gloss polish is likable, and in concert he tends to stretch out a bit with his band, which is first-rate. For a more buoyant take on jazz-pop crossover, though, look to the other half of this bill, featuring Mr. Pizzarelli, the ever-breezy guitarist and singer. At 8, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, One Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722, www.njpac.org; $20 to $58. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>DON BYRON PLAYS JUNIOR WALKER (Tonight through Sunday night) The clarinetist Don Byron has lately been playing more tenor saxophone, a development that motivated his latest concept album, ''Do the Boomerang'' (Blue Note). It's a tribute to the Motown saxophonist-singer Junior Walker, by a clutch of musicians equally at home playing jazz and soul: the guitarist David Gilmore, the keyboardist George Colligan, the bassist Brad Jones and the drummer Rodney Holmes. One of the two vocalists on the album, Chris Thomas King, will also appear. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $25; $30 tonight and tomorrow. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>REGINA CARTER (Wednesday and Thursday) Ms. Carter is a jazz violinist of uncommon accomplishment: a few years ago she became the first African-American musician to play Paganini's cherished instrument in Genoa, Italy, and a few weeks ago she received a prestigious ''genius grant'' from the MacArthur Foundation. Her recent album ''I'll Be Seeing You: A Sentimental Journey'' (Verve) honors the memory of her mother by reinterpreting some of the prewar popular songs she loved. (Through Oct. 21.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>STEVE COLEMAN AND FIVE ELEMENTS (Tuesday and Wednesday) Mr. Coleman's alto saxophone cuts cleanly through the angular free-funk of his signature ensemble, which includes Jonathan Finlayson on trumpet, Tim Albright on trombone, Jen Shyu on vocals, Tyshawn Sorey on drums and, on Wednesday only, Thomas Morgan on bass. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $12; members, $10. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>COOPER-MOORE QUARTET/MATANA ROBERTS QUARTET (Tomorrow) The man known as Cooper-Moore, an extreme polyglot even by avant-garde standards, leads a band that features his own handmade instruments alongside the alto saxophone of Darius Jones and the percussion of Juma Santos and Chad Taylor. Matana Roberts, a husky-toned alto saxophonist and junior member of the A.A.C.M., is at her best when responding to ensemble actions; her group, performing in a later set, includes the tenor saxophonist Matt Bauder, the bassist Tom Abbs and the drummer Tomas Fujiwara. At 7:30 and 9 p.m., Clemente Soto Vélez SEA Theater, 107 Suffolk Street, at Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 696-6681, visionfestival.org; cover, $20 a set. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>EDDIE DANIELS's 65TH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION (Thursday) The clarinetist Eddie Daniels will reach standard retirement age on Thursday, though he doesn't seem to have much interest in laying back. The first of his four nights at Iridium will feature numerous guests, including his fellow clarinetists Ken Peplowski, Ron Odrich and Paquito D'Rivera (who also plays alto saxophone). The house rhythm section will consist of Joe Locke on vibraphone, David Finck on bass and Joe La Barbera on drums. (Through Oct. 22.) At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $32.50, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>* FESTIVAL OF NEW TRUMPET MUSIC (Tonight through Sunday night) This stylistically expansive series concludes this weekend, after a month of horn-centric programming. Tonight the trumpeters John McNeil and Ron Horton jointly present a group that also includes a third trumpeter, the festival's founder, Dave Douglas; tomorrow there will be sets led by Butch Morris and then Ted Daniel. The series finale, a benefit for music programs in New York public schools, will feature an honor roll of guests, including the composer and alto saxophonist John Zorn, the bassist Henry Grimes and the Zlatne Uste Balkan Brass Band. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 10:30, Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; cover, $15, with a one-drink minimum. Sunday from 2 to 5 p.m. at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-6377, fontmusic.org; $20 to $100. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>DIZZY GILLESPIE ALL-STAR BIG BAND (Tuesday through Thursday) Bebop's goateed ambassador did some of his best work with big bands, a fact that this repertory ensemble, led by his former trombonist and arranger Slide Hampton, happily exploits. The band -- which has a strong recent album, ''Dizzy's Business'' (Telarc) -- includes other veterans of Gillespie's employ, like the saxophonists James Moody and Paquito D'Rivera. The trumpeter Roy Hargrove is a natural choice to fill Gillespie's shoes. (Through Oct. 22.) At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>* JIM HALL TRIO (Tuesday through Thursday) Jim Hall's economical style and deep harmonic command have made him a quiet hero of jazz guitar; he leads his regular trio with the bassist Steve LaSpina and the drummer Terry Clarke. (Through Oct. 22.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.net; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>STEFON HARRIS (Wednesday) ''African Tarantella: Dances With Duke'' (Blue Note) is the sixth album by the vibraphonist Stefon Harris, and one of his strongest; it's an interpretation of music from two Duke Ellington suites, along with several original themes. As he does on the album, Mr. Harris augments his working quartet here with the trombonist Steve Turre, the clarinetist Mark Vinci, the flutist Anne Drummond, the cellist Louise Dubin and the violist Junah Chung.

        <p>JIMMY HEATH'S 80TH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION (Tonight through Sunday night) The saxophonist and composer Jimmy Heath will turn 80 this month, and the Blue Note is celebrating the occasion with an engagement replete with such special guests as the trumpeter Clark Terry (tonight and tomorrow) and the saxophonist and flutist James Moody (Sunday), who have both infused their octogenarian years with youthful brio. At 8 and 10:30, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>RODNEY KENDRICK (Tonight) Mr. Kendrick is a commanding pianist who has gradually been returning to the spotlight after a bit of a hiatus. He appears as part of a new Fazioli Salon solo piano series at the Klavierhaus workshop. At 8, Klavierhaus, 211 West 58th Street, Manhattn, (212) 245-4535, pianoculture.com; $20. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>* LATIN JAZZ CONCERT USA (Thursday) A rich bonanza of Afro-Caribbean and Latin American artists, including the conga legend Candido Camero, the flutist Dave Valentin, the singer Xiomara Laugart and the guitarist and singer David Oquendo, among many others. At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824, the-townhall-nyc.org; $30 to $60. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>BEN MONDER (Wednesday) ''Oceana'' (Sunnyside), the most recent album by the guitarist Ben Monder, is a small-scale but ambitious suite of original music that doesn't sound quite like anything else. He will present some of the same material here, with the bassist Ben Street and the drummer Ted Poor. At 9:30 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, near Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 929-9883, 55bar.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>MARK MURPHY (Tomorrow and Sunday) Mr. Murphy is a singer known mainly for sly insouciance, but on his recent album ''Once to Every Heart'' (Verve), he opted for a burnished and broken romanticism. He is performing with a small group featuring the pianist Misha Piatigorsky. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., with a midnight set tomorrow, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>MICHAEL MUSILLAMI TRIO (Wednesday) Serpentine lyricism and angular forms are major attributes of ''Dachau,'' an album released last year by the guitarist Michael Mussillami on his own Playscape label. Joined by the bassist Joe Fonda and the drummer George Schuller, he'll revisit that recording, as well as a newer one, ''Fragile Forms,'' also on Playscape. At 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>TED NASH QUINTET (Tuesday through Thursday) The saxophonist Ted Nash has proved to be a smart and resourceful bandleader, especially for ensembles like this one, which has Marcus Printup on trumpet, Frank Kimbrough on piano, Ben Allison on bass and Matt Wilson on drums. (Through Oct. 22.) At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>ROY NATHANSON (Wednesday) ''Sotto Voce'' (AUM Fidelity), the latest recording by the saxophonist Roy Nathanson, makes full use of his unusual skills as a conceptualist and raconteur. All the members of his band double on vocals, occasionally suggesting a literate and subversive barbershop quartet; one, Napoleon Maddox, provides the beat-box percussion that hustles the music along. At 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778, joespub.com; cover, $15, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>AARON PARKS QUARTET (Tonight) Aaron Parks, a promising young pianist who has turned heads for the past few years in Terence Blanchard's working band, leads a quartet full of fine players: the guitarist Ben Monder, the bassist Matt Brewer and the drummer Rodney Green. At 9 and 10:30, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $15; members, $10. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>SECTION QUARTET/TRAVIS SULLIVAN'S BJORKESTRA (Thursday) Two young ensembles, each focused on repertory of a contemporary strain: the Section Quartet takes a crack at the Radiohead album ''OK Computer,'' while the Bjorkestra scores the music of Bjork for big band. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, kaufman-center.org; $25 ($20 in advance). (Chinen)</p>
        <p>US FREE (Tuesday and Wednesday) The drummer Andrew Cyrille and the bassist Henry Grimes are members of an avant-garde jazz generation that came of age in the 1960's and 70's, while the tenor saxophonist Bill McHenry is a comparably newer arrival who has earned respect in his peer group and beyond. The trio has a goofy name that will probably ring true, with collectivity and freedom high on the agenda. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $20. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>* BEBO VALDÉS (Tonight and tomorrow) Mr. Valdés, a pianist, composer and august figure in the history of Cuban music, won a Grammy and a Latin Grammy last year for his superlative album ''Bebo de Cuba'' (Calle 54). The centerpiece of that album is ''Suite Cubana,'' an opus for big band; he will conduct it here with the Afro-Latin Jazz Orchestra, a resident ensemble of Jazz at Lincoln Center. Mr. Valdés, who turned 88 this week, will also play the piano with musicians culled from the ranks of the orchestra, including some who appeared on the album. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500, jalc.org; $37.50 to $127.50. (Chinen)</p>

        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>'LA BOHÈME' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) Updated to the years around World War I, this is one of the New York City Opera's best productions. A new cast has taken over, including two singers new to the company, Inna Dukach as Mimi and Robert Gardner as Marcello. Dinyar Vania will sing Rodolfo; Dana Beth Miller is the Musetta; Kyungmook Yum is Schaunard; and Eric Jordan is Colline. Steven Mosteller conducts. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Anne Midgette)</p>
        <p>'CARMEN' (Wednesday) Rinat Shaham, who made her company debut as Zerlina, is a small singer for Carmen; worse, New York City Opera's production seems to have veiled her spark, rendering her a mere stereotype. Her Don José, Mark Duffin, has warm lower notes and a pressed, often flat sound on top; the Escamillo is Adrian Gans, who made his company debut in the role. The high point is Latonia Moore, a radiant-voiced Micaëla. Ari Pelto conducts, a little woodenly but competently enough. At 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $125. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>'The ELIxIr of love' (Tonight, Sunday and Thursday) The director Jonathan Miller has created an all-American ''Elisir d'Amore,'' transposing the action to a vintage roadside diner to create something that's dramatically consistent but also dramatically slight. Yet ''Elixir'' is a delightful opera, and it's decently sung by Anna Skibinsky, an Adina with a little ribbon of a voice; John Tessier, an honest, solid, if North American Nemorino; and especially Jan Opalach, who has a lot of fun and sounds very good as Dulcamara. George Manahan's conducting is not exactly Italianate. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 1:30 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>'FAUST' (Monday and Thursday) Gounod's lush score is back at the Metropolitan Opera in Andrei Serban's staging, now less hyperactive than when it was introduced in 2005. Alas, someone appears to have gotten to its soul before Méphistophélès had the chance: the singers, though all fine, put the drama at arm's length, so the work's intense passions don't quite come through. The cast includes Ramón Vargas in the title role, Ruth Ann Swenson as Marguerite, and Ildar Abdrazakov as Méphistophélès, with Bertrand de Billy conducting. On Thursday Darina Takova takes over the role of Marguerite, and Fernando de la Mora replaces Mr. Vargas. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $320. (Allan Kozinn)</p>
        <p>'LA GIOCONDA' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) This wild and woolly exercise in hate and mayhem continues at the Metropolitan Opera, with stirring music, old-fashioned production values and a strong cast that includes Violeta Urmana, Olga Borodina and Aquiles Machado. On Wednesday Aprile Millo replaces Ms. Urmana. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $320. (Bernard Holland)</p>
        <p>* 'IDOMENEO' (Tomorrow) Those who count on Ben Heppner to sing the heldentenor repertory may be surprised to hear him in the title role of Mozart's 1781 opera seria. But this role of the tormented king of Crete after the Trojan War has heroic dimensions, dramatically and vocally, which Mr. Heppner relishes in his clarion and compelling yet elegantly Mozartean portrayal. The rich-voiced mezzo-soprano Kristine Jepson is Idomeneo's devoted son Idamante. In the crucial role of Ilia, Nicole Heaston takes the place of Dorothea Röschmann in tomorrow's performance. James Levine conducts. Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's 1982 production is still handsome and effective. At 1 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $42 to $320. (Anthony Tommasini)</p>
        <p>* 'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Tuesday) The abstract staging in Anthony Minghella's 0visually beautiful production deftly employs movable screens, billowing fabrics, stylized costumes and a life-size puppet manipulated by three black-clad puppeteers to portray Butterfly's 3-year-old son. Vocally, neither of the leads, the earthy-voiced soprano Cristina Gallardo-Domâs as Butterfly and the robustly Italianate tenor Marcello Giordani as Pinkerton, is ideal. But they do honorable work. Asher Fisch conducts. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>'THE MERRY WIDOW' (Tonight and tomorrow, and Sunday) The enterprising Dicapo Opera Theater has some ambitious productions lined up, including a revised version of ''Thérèse Raquin'' by Tobias Picker, who composed ''An American Tragedy'' for the Met. But Dicapo opens its season with a new production by Michael Capasso of this frothy, tuneful and worldly-wise Lehar operetta. It will use spoken dialogue that was essentially rewritten by the playwright Wendy Wasserstein. Constantine Kitsopoulos conducts. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 4 p.m., 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-9438, dicapo.com; $47.50. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>'ORPHEUS' (Tonight) Next season at Glimmerglass is under the star of Orpheus, not figuratively but literally: All four operas represent different takes on the Orpheus legend, from Offenbach's irreverent satire to Philip Glass's ''Orphée.'' In a kind of preview recital tonight, excerpts from all five operas (the others are by Monteverdi, Gluck and Haydn) will join other Orpheus songs by Vaughan Williams and Schubert. Among the good young singers are the sopranos Caroline Worra and Michael Maniaci -- yes, he's a man, and he will sing the lead in the Gluck/Berlioz version. At 7:30, Morgan Library, 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 590-0392, www.themorgan.org; $45; $35 for members. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>* 'DIE TOTE STADT' (Tomorrow) Erich Wolfgang Korngold is best known for his pioneering scores for swashbuckling Hollywood films of the 1930's. But in Germany in 1920, at 24, he was hailed as the brilliant and promising composer of a mysterious opera, ''Die Tote Stadt.'' The New York City Opera has revived its 1975 production of this work, which incorporates film elements, video projections and scrims to evoke the dreamlike story. The cast, though not ideal, is appealing, and George Manahan conducts a sweeping account of Korngold's lyrically sumptuous and theatrical music. At 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $125. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>'VIOLET FIRE' (Wednesday) Jon Gibson, best known as an early and steadfast member of the Philip Glass Ensemble, has created this multimedia opera about Nikola Tesla, the early-20th-century scientist and inventor who made early breakthroughs in radio broadcasting, electricity and robotics. Miriam Seidel wrote the libretto, and Terry O'Reilly (a director of the Mabou Mines theater company) directs the impressionistic staging. At 7:30 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $20 to $40. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>'DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE' (Tonight) The revival of Julie Taymor's production of Mozart's ''Zauberflöte'' is under way at the Metropolitan Opera, complete with the magical puppets and stage effects that made it an audience hit when it opened in 2004. Isabel Bayrakdarian, who sings with a clear, bright, expressive soprano, is a radiant and believable Pamina, and Nathan Gunn uses his vibrant baritone and dramatic energy to create an instantly appealing Papageno. Their charisma somewhat overshadows Jonas Kaufmann as Tamino. At 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $320. (Vivien Schweitzer)</p>
        <p>Classical Music</p>
        <p>* AMERICAN COMPOSERS ORCHESTRA (Tonight) This orchestra opens its season with the world premieres of Michael Gantonska's ''After the Wings of Migratory Birds,'' Evan Ziporyn's ''Big Grenadilla,'' Brad Lubman's ''Fuzzy Logic'' and Corey Dargel's ''All the Notes and Rhythms I've Ever Loved.'' Also on the program are recent works by Michael Gandolfi and Susie Ibarra, and an oldie -- O.K., an American classic -- by Charles Ives. At 7:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $32 and $40. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>APOLLO'S FIRE BAROQUE ORCHESTRA (Thursday) ''Bach in Context'' is the title of the Miller Theater series, and this installment contextualizes Johann Sebastian by presenting him in tandem with his friend and rival Telemann, and letting the audience judge between them. The news is the New York debut of the renowned, Cleveland-based and reportedly excellent baroque orchestra Apollo's Fire. At 8 p.m., Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com; $35; $15 for students. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>CAPPELLA ANDREA BARCA (Wednesday and Thursday) The estimable Hungarian pianist Andras Schiff brings his cutely named ensemble to Alice Tully Hall for two all-Mozart programs. At 8 p.m., Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $30 to $56. (Holland)</p>
        <p>* LEON FLEISHER (Thursday) After a neurological condition rendered his right hand nearly useless more than 40 years ago, the pianist Leon Fleisher, now 78, spent years performing only left-hand repertory. But thanks to new treatments, he has been making a remarkable comeback. His Carnegie Hall recital features some works from his new CD, ''Leon Fleisher: The Journey'' (Vangard Classics), including Bach's ''Capriccio on the Departure of His Most Dearly Beloved Brother'' and Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue in D minor (BWV 903) and Stravinsky's Serenade in A. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $26 to $88. (Schweitzer)</p>
        <p>ANNE-MARIE MCDERMOTT (Thursday) Ms. McDermott, one of New York's more interesting pianists and musicians, has a go at Bach's ''Goldberg'' Variations. At 10:30 p.m., Kaplan Penthouse, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $30. (Holland)</p>
        <p>MET CHAMBER ENSEMBLE (Sunday) A new piece by the unquenchable Elliott Carter called ''In the Distances of Sleep'' will be offered by this adventurous and accomplished offshoot of James Levine's Metropolitan Opera Orchestra. The program includes Mozart's G Minor Piano Quartet and the Mendelssohn Octet. At 5 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $58 and $68. (Holland)</p>
        <p>NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tomorrow and Thursday) The Philharmonic's Young People's Concerts may not have the high profile that Leonard Bernstein once brought to them, but they tend to be well-planned and engaging. Tomorrow Delta David Gier conducts ''The Ages of Music: Baroque,'' the first in a series of programs that will survey music history. On the regular subscription series this week the brilliant American conductor David Robertson leads works by Stravinsky and Mozart, including a violin concerto by each, with Gil Shaham as soloist. Then on Thursday Avery Fisher Hall becomes a movie palace when the dynamic young Xian Zhang conducts Prokofiev's pulsating score for Sergei Eisenstein's epic film ''Alexander Nevsky'' (1938), while that cinematic masterpiece is screened. Don't bring popcorn. Today at 11 a.m., tomorrow at 2 (Young People's Concert) and 8 p.m., and Tuesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $24 to $96; remaining tickets for the Young People's Concert are $8 to $24. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>'PROMENADE CONCERT' (Tonight) The ever-inventive George Steel has assembled a program of rarities, both light and serious, in the tradition of the popular (and popularly priced) Promenades concerts. For the occasion, Mr. Steel is conducting the Vox Vocal Ensemble and the Gotham City Orchestra, with Tiffany Jackson, soprano, and Alexandra Cooke, mezzo-soprano. The program includes music by Lalo, Gounod, Chabrier, Villette, Schmitt and Messiaen. At 8, Riverside Church, Riverside Drive at 122nd Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com; $10. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>STEVE REICH TRIBUTE (Sunday) As part of its celebration of Steve Reich's 70th birthday, the Whitney Museum has assembled a four-hour concert of his music and the works of younger composers whose music he influenced. The selections run from Mr. Reich's early phase piece ''It's Gonna Rain'' (1965), through his classic scores of the 1970's and 80's (among them ''Clapping Music,'' ''Music for Mallet Instruments, Voice and Organ'' and ''Vermont Counterpoint'') and more recent works. The performers include several superb new-music bands -- Alarm Will Sound, the Prism Saxophone Quartet, So Percussion and Tactus -- as well as the flutist and conductor Ransom Wilson, and the guitarist Lee Ranaldo, of Sonic Youth. At 2 p.m., 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639, whitney.org; free with admission to the museum, which is $15; $10 for students and 62+. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>MAXIM VENGEROV (Tomorrow) This popular violin virtuoso joins Alisa Weilerstein, a cellist, and Lilya Silberstein, a pianist, in trios by Shostakovich and Tchaikovsky. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $31 to $100. (Holland)</p>
        <p>WESTMINISTER CATHEDRAL CHOIR (Tuesday) This choir will perform choral works from the Renaissance to the 20th century. The lineup includes music by Christopher Tye, William Byrd, Arvo Pärt and Marcel Dupré. It also features ''Ave Maria'' by Bruckner. At 7:30 p.m., St. Thomas Church, Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street, (212) 664-9360, www.saintthomaschurch.org; $25 to $60. (Schweitzer)</p>
        <p>* PIETER WISPELWEY (Sunday) Beethoven's complete works for cello and piano have increasingly shown themselves to be a fine large-scale concert for a gifted cellist. Now taking on the corpus -- five sonatas and three sets of variations, with two intermissions -- is this Dutch cellist, whose last cycles in New York have been of the Bach suites. However, he has recorded the Beethoven, to great acclaim, with a regular recital partner who appears with him this weekend, the Croatian pianist Dejan Lazic. At 2 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $50. (Midgette)</p>

        <p>BETONTANC (Thursday) This Slovenian company's press materials say it is composed of ''self-described dissidents, egocentrics, pop-demons, ideologists, pragmatists, humorists, etc.'' It comes to New York as part of the European Dream Festival. The dissidents and egocentrics will take on Dostoyevsky's ''Crime and Punishment'' in ''Wrestling Dostoyevsky.'' Sounds promising. (Through Oct. 21.)

        <p>COMPLEXIONS (Tomorrow and Sunday) This group, formed by Dwight Rhoden and Desmond Richardson, is known for attracting superb dancers who tend to be stronger than the choreography on offer. That may not be true this time, since the troupe is presenting Ulysses Dove's rarely seen ''Dancing on the Front Porch of Heaven,'' originally choreographed for the Royal Swedish Ballet. Also on the program is a new work, ''Hissy Fits,'' by Mr. Rhoden, and an excerpt from his hyperactive ''Anthem.'' Tomorrow at 7.30 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722. (Sulcas)</p>

        <p>HENNING RUBSAM'S SENSEDANCE (Thursday) A new work, ''Merciless Beauty,'' from the German-born, New York City-based Mr. Rubsam, who works mostly in a balletic idiom but also draws from the worlds of jazz and social dance. His work can be uneven but almost always holds rewards. (Through Oct. 22.) At 8 p.m., Joyce Soho, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 334-7479; $25; artists and students, $15. (Sulcas)</p>
        <p>* SYLVIE GUILLEM AND RUSSELL MALIPHANT (Tonight through Sunday) This star French ballerina, now segueing into modern dance, joins forces with the British dancer and choreographer Russell Maliphant for a four-part program called ''Push,'' the first result of the newly announced collaboration between City Center and the Sadler's Wells Theater in London. There will be two Guillem solos, one Maliphant solo and a duet. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 3 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org; $35 to $85. (Rockwell)</p>
        <p>RENNIE HARRIS (Tonight) Mr. Harris blends hip-hop poetry, rap music and movement and traditional African dance in ''Prince ScareKrow's Road to the Emerald City.'' A preview of the work is part of the Impact Festival, which focuses on human rights, social justice and political activism. At 8, Schimmel Center for the Arts, Pace University, 3 Spruce Street, between Park Row and Gold Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 253-7017, theatermania.com; $15 to $35. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>ANNABELLA LENZA AND DAMAN HARUN (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Lenza will present a new work that deconstructs the ritual of the Roman Catholic Mass, and Mr. Harun will explore spirituality and religion in another new piece. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 3 p.m., Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, TriBeCa, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com and dnadance.org; $17. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>* SARAH MICHELSON (Wednesday and Thursday) This star of downtown experimental modern dance gets her big Next Wave festival break with four performances of a piece called ''Dogs,'' commissioned by the Brooklyn Academy of Music and designed for its Harvey Theater space. (Through Oct. 21.) At 7:30 p.m., Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $20 to $40. (Rockwell)</p>
        <p>MOLLIE O'BRIEN/MOB PRODUCTIONS (Thursday) Ms. O'Brien's quartet, ''Mammal,'' explores how aggression and force relate to intimacy and connection. (Through Oct. 22.) At 8 p.m., Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, TriBeCa, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com and dnadance.org; $17. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>'PEAK PERFORMANCES' (Thursday) This series aims to provoke, and its choice, Jan Fabre, is said to be a first-rate provocateur. His new ''Quando l'uomo principale e una donna'' (''When the Leading Man Turns Out to Be a Woman'') is an homage to Yves Klein, who used nude women as paintbrushes. Mr. Fabre takes things further by coating the stage floor with olive oil. (Through Oct. 21.) At 7:30 p.m., Alexander Kasser Theater, Montclair State University, Normal Avenue, Montclair, (973) 655-5112, peakperfs.org; $35. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>STEPHEN PETRONIO AND RACOCO PRODUCTIONS (Tomorrow and Thursday) Mr. Petronio and his quicksilver choreography company are featured tomorrow in the Dance at the Winter Garden series. Theater-dance pieces by Racoco Productions on Thursday draw on burlesque and clown and mask work, integrating them with outsider and fine art and traditional dance movement. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Thursday at 12:30 p.m., World Financial Center, 220 Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505, stephenpetronio.com, racoco.org; free. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>SPRINGDANCE DIALOGUE (Tonight and tomorrow night) The American component of this international festival based in the Netherlands ends with work by Myriam Gourfink and Nami Yamamoto tonight and Kristyna Lhotakova, Tatiana Gordeeva and Levi Gonzalez tomorrow.

At 8 p.m., Morocco's Academy of Middle Eastern Dance, 6 West 20th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 352-3101, theatermania.com; $15. (Dunning)</p>

        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'A DEAF ARTIST IN EARLY AMERICA: THE WORLDS OF JOHN BREWSTER JR.,' through Jan. 7. Few early American artists painted more incisive and empathetic likenesses than John Brewster Jr. (1766-1854), the subject of a fine traveling show at the American Folk Art Museum. And few worked under such potentially limiting circumstances: Brewster was born deaf before remedial help or a common signing language existed. The case the show makes for Brewster's physical condition's being reflected in his art is inconclusive, but the paintings are wonderful. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Holland Cotter)</p>
        <p>* ASIA SOCIETY: 'GILDED SPLENDOR: TREASURES OF CHINA'S LIAO EMPIRE (907-1125),' through Dec. 31. For a thousand years the Khitan, who established the Liao Empire, were dismissed by Chinese historians, but they have been redeemed by late-20th-century archaeological discoveries. The evidence is laid out in this show of more than 200 objects excavated from tombs, temples and walled cities in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China. The first major display of Liao objects outside China, the show gives the lie to the Khitan as cultural nobodies. .Ceramics, wood carvings, painted screens and belts; bronze mirrors that studded the outside of the White Pagoda; writing instruments; and even an ancient spittoon add to the bite and flavor of this show. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Grace Glueck)</p>
        <p>* FRICK COLLECTION: 'CIMABUE AND EARLY ITALIAN DEVOTIONAL PAINTING,' through Dec. 31. Weighing in at six works of art, with about 20 images among them, this is one of the most stupendous very small exhibitions most of us are likely to see. It reunites two small, beautiful, newly attributed panels by the Italian master Cimabue, whose turn toward naturalism increased the sense of space, gesture and feeling in Florentine painting, and helped set the Renaissance in motion. The panels, which depict a Virgin and Child Enthroned and a Flagellation and may be from the same altarpiece, are flanked by related works. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Roberta Smith)</p>
        <p>* METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'BRUSH AND INK: THE CHINESE ART OF WRITING,' through Jan. 21. If painting and writing can be seen as modes of thinking, and they can, then this exhibition is as much a brainstorming session as an art exhibition, crackling with ideas and arguments every step of the way. It is also a sequence of moods, with impassioned voices calling out from the 80 scrolls and inscribed fans that line the galleries, which include colossal examples of contemporary 21st-century art that both depart from and preserve a tradition, (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>* THE MET: 'SEAN SCULLY: WALL OF LIGHT,' through Jan. 15. The capacious, day-lighted mezzanine galleries at the Met are the perfect setting for Sean Scully's bold and energizing ''Wall of Light'' paintings from the series he started in 1998. These large-scale oils on canvas wow the viewer with their scale, intensity of color and sheer dominance of space. All have this in common: They are richly painted surfaces of close-laid vertical and horizontal bars (he calls them bricks) whose arrangement suggests constructed walls of stone. Although they appear totally abstract, with their all-over arrangements of bars that superficially vary only in color, size and juxtaposition, they evoke landscapes, people, events, the work of other artists. (See above.) (Glueck)</p>
        <p>* NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: LEGACIES: CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS REFLECT ON SLAVERY, through Jan. 7. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the 1960's, a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>RUBIN MUSEUM OF ART: 'I SEE NO STRANGER: EARLY SIKH ART AND DEVOTION,' through Jan. 29. Sikhism is the world's fifth-largest organized religion, but how many Westerners know that it was conceived as universalist in scope and radically egalitarian socially? Or that its holy book, far from being a catalog of sectarian dos and don'ts, is a bouquet of poetic songs blending the fragrances of Hindu ragas, Muslim hymns, and Punjabi folk tunes? This is precisely the information delivered by this small and beautiful show. Vivid and concentrated, it presents, mostly through miniature paintings, a kind of Sikh self-portrait, the image of a history shaped by hard work, pluralism and mystical transport, as well as by militancy. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>* THE WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: MARK GROTJAHN, through Jan. 7. Mining the early Modernist cusp where the figurative, the geometric, the spatial and the visionary still remain tangled, this Los-Angeles-based painter deploys his abstract pinwheel motifs on paper in eight brash, door-sized drawings. Multiple vanishing points destabilize radiating compositions that are variously Op and buzzy, darkly monochrome (and a little too pretentiously moody) or candy-color bright. In some works the motif is doubled and angled, decreasing the shield-like frontality and opening up new optical and spatial possibilities. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)</p>
        <p>THE WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'PICASSO AND AMERICAN ART,' through Jan. 28. Despite the glamorous pictures in it, this is one of those dull affairs incubated in the world of academe: a walk-through slide show that states the obvious. Picasso's ''Woman in White,'' a picture of heavenly arrogance, hangs between Arshile Gorky's ''Artist and His Mother'' and de Kooning's ''Standing Man,'' terrific paintings too. We are meant to register the plain insinuation of Picasso's neo-Classicism, then move on. Next slide, please. The show ends with a virtual retrospective of Picasso-inspired works by Jasper Johns. In picture after picture, Johns buries allusions to the great Spaniard, aspiring presumably to Picasso's own late meditations on Velázquez. Except that even when he was old and running out of steam, Picasso still had joie de vivre. Johns doesn't so much enthrone Picasso as repeatedly entomb him. See above. (Michael Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>DONA NELSON The painter Dona Nelson is in midcareer, and her work process is more experimental than ever, on the evidence of the four large pieces in this show. One is made with layers of hosed-down pigment; another is festooned with ropes of stiffened cloth; a third is a rubbing from an earlier painting; a fourth is reversible. In messing around with form, Ms. Nelson lets beauty fall where it may, which makes her art feel exciting and awake. Thomas Erben Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, fourth floor, (212) 645-8701, thomaserben.com, through Oct. 21. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>DARIO ROBLETO: 'FEAR AND TENDERNESS IN MEN' Minus the checklist, these works come across as mawkish facsimiles of conventional 20th-century assemblage, 19th-century funeral wreaths, homemade reliquaries or folk art. Their impact expands as you read the lists of materials involved: all kinds of artifacts of American wars, from shrapnel and battlefield dirt to soldiers' letters used to make pulp. But it all remains too visually inaccessible, in addition to being a bit presumptuous about the keepsakes of people no longer alive. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-9460, through Oct. 28. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>BARD GRADUATE CENTER: 'LIONS, DRAGONS AND OTHER BEASTS: AQUAMANILIA OF THE MIDDLE AGES, VESSELS FOR CHURCH AND TABLE'  Aquamanilia sounds like the latest perfume or sorbet but actually refers to the small, cunningly figurative medieval vessels used for ritual hand washing. Cast in sturdy, glowing copper alloy, most often in the form of lions with serpents on their backs, aquamanilia are now having their first exhibition, complete with lavish catalog. The show feels like a walk-in bestiary and is enhanced by striking abbreviations reminiscent of folk art. Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design and Culture, 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000, bgc.bard.edu; closes on Sunday. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* GERALD DAVIS Growing up can be hell, especially if you're an art-loving sissy. This is more or less the story told by Mr. Davis's auspicious New York solo debut. The show is titled ''1986,'' for the year the artist entered his teens, and in several polished autobiographical drawings it illustrates a state of social and psychological crisis already in progress. John Connelly Presents, 625 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 337-9563; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>TOMOO GOKITA: DRUNKO A whiz at drawing, this Tokyo-based artist is making his New York solo debut with a show of his first paintings, executed in black and white gouache on canvas. ATM Gallery, 619 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 375-0349, atmgallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>ALICE KÖNTIZ Ambiguity is the thread in this compact show. Its various small sculptures do double duty as furniture, specifically as supports for other art. Formally, each piece looks at once designer-chic and job lot cheap. The gallery installation could be either a showroom or a living room. Or both, which is the point. Hudson Franklin, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-1189; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>ADAM MCEWEN Most of the more interesting artists these days work in several media and tend to approach ideas at a slant. The British-born Adam McEwen qualifies on both counts in a solo show of abstract paintings made with chewing gum and photographs of an apartment complex in Queens. Nicole Klagsbrun, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 243-3335, closes tomorrow. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>TAYLOR MCKIMENS: 'THE DRIPS' In his second show this artist continues to make highly effective full-scale figures and installations that seem to have escaped from a comic book, which they have. His vision of down-and-out America has intensified and is now dominated by oozing, hairy, often faceless blobs called the Drips. Clementine, 623 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-5937; closes tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* RIVANE NEUENSCHWANDER: 'OTHER STORIES AND STORIES OF OTHERS' The New York gallery debut of this Brazilian artist is beautifully in step with the somewhat pious trend of making art out of almost nothing to circumvent the big, bad art market. In video, collages and typewriter drawings, randomness rules, and the centerpiece makes everyday magic from fans and bushels of bright tissue-paper circles. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-4144, tanyabonakdargallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* SARA VANDERBEEK: 'MIRROR IN THE SKY' Ranging through 20th-century culture, this talented artist pushes set-up photography and photo appropriation in directions at once worldly and highly personal. By building, lighting and photographing little stage-set constructions festooned with cut-out images, buttons, beads, trinkets and sometimes glitter, she creates poetic, strange amalgams of sculpture, collage and photo montage, and cuts Modernism down to size. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-9460; closes tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>WALLPAPER LAB In this show 15 artists (including Douglas Gordon, Gary Simmons, Fred Tomaselli and Phoebe Washburn) adapt their art to the wallpaper format. The results vary tremendously, but it is always interesting to see how artistic ideas translate from one medium to another. Lennon, Weinberg, 514 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 941-0012; closes tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>AARON YOUNG Before the opening of this show, Mr. Young hired a biker to rev up in the gallery and lay down DeKooningesque tracks of burnt rubber. He also installed painted bronze casts of street curbing and invited skateboarders to perform on them until some of the paint wore off and the gold-colored metal came through. Four ''trick,'' audience-participation paintings hang in the back gallery. Harris Lieberman, 89 Vandam Street, between Hudson and Greenwich Streets, South Village, (212) 206-1290; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>'ZOO STORY' A clay gorilla by Daisy Youngblood, a bronze she-wolf by Kiki Smith, a flock of concrete sheep by Françoise-Xavier Lalanne and works about animals by more than 20 other artists, including John Baldessari and Katharina Fritsch, turn the first floor of this sleek, three-story private museum into a diverting menagerie. Fisher Landau Center for Art, 38-27 30th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-0727, flcart.org; closes on Monday. (Ken Johnson)</p>
