        <p>LEAD: IN an increasing number of Connecticut cemeteries, he who steals a historic gravestone steals a fake. Cemetery associations around the state are replacing old gravestones with concrete copies, saving the originals from thieves, vandals and the weather.</p>
        <p>IN an increasing number of Connecticut cemeteries, he who steals a historic gravestone steals a fake. Cemetery associations around the state are replacing old gravestones with concrete copies, saving the originals from thieves, vandals and the weather.</p>
        <p>''What we're doing is removing only the most significant stones, and replacing them with exact replicas,'' said the president-elect of the Association of Gravestone Studies, Alfred M. Fredette, who is working with the trustees of old burial grounds across the state.</p>
        <p>''They look incredibly like the originals,'' Mr. Fredette said of the copies, which are made by a craftsman from Holland, Mass., William McGeer. ''I've seen people doing rubbings of the replicas, they look so much like the real thing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fredette said the reproductions were in cemeteries in New Haven, Mansfield and East Haddam, and associations in East Haven, Lebanon, Hartford, Wethersfield and Franklin were considering replacing some of their own. The old stones go into local museums, where possible, or into locked vaults.</p>
        <p>But in some cases, there is a reluctance to tamper with old burial grounds, no matter how perfect the copies.</p>
        <p>''It's logical, it makes sense to replace the stones before they're stolen or damaged,'' said the pastor of the Franklin Congregational Church, the Rev. Robert W. Wright, whose church is considering replacing the Daniel Squier grave marker, an 18th-century stone in its cemetery.</p>
        <p>''But some people feel it goes against tradition,'' Mr. Wright said. ''They feel very strongly that the stones should stay in place.'' The 17th- and 18th-century gravestones, ignored for decades, have in recent years become popular examples of early American folk art.</p>
        <p>In New York, many of the lichen-covered stones are fetching prices of between $1,000 and $5,000. Mr. Fredette said he had heard of people making them into coffee tables and headboards for beds.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, it was made a class B felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, to steal a gravestone, and the law apparently had an impact.</p>
        <p>In Franklin, for instance, the Squier stone, along with three other examples of early American gravestone art, were returned to the cemetery within a month of the law's taking effect.</p>
        <p>''As long as there are markets for them, the stones are going to continue to disappear, I'm sure,'' said Mr. Fredette, who was one of the most ardent advocates of the new legislation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fredette said Mr. McGeer made plaster casts of the original stones, and then made the replicas from his own mixture of concrete. His proprietary secret, how to make the stones appear weathered, is one that makes his stones more realistic than most, Mr. Fredette said.</p>
        <p>The cost of the replicas is generally $200 to $300 each, Mr. Fredette said.</p>
        <p>''If at all possible, the stone should remain in the community, where it can be available for viewing at any time,'' Mr. Fredette said.</p>
        <p>The Mansfield Historical Society recently replaced the early-18th-century gravestone of Exercise Conant, and put the original in the vault of the historical society's museum.</p>
        <p>Not only was Mr. Conant the son of Roger Conant, who founded what later became known as Salem, Mass., but the stone was also the oldest in town.</p>
        <p>''We just felt, since it was the earliest one we know of it Mansfield, that it was in danger of being stolen,'' said a historical society officer, Roberta Smith.</p>
        <p>The stone, carved by Obidiah Wheeler of Lebanon, reads: ''Here Lieth the body of Mistar Exercise Conant who died Aprell the 28, 1722, aged 83 years.''</p>
        <p>''Obidiah Wheeler was an excellent carver, but nearly illiterate,'' Mr. Fredette said.</p>
        <p>''Everyone was very satisfied with the replica,'' Ms. Smith said. ''It's very hard to even tell the difference.''</p>
        <p>A member of the East Haddam Historical Society, Jonathan P. Twiss, who has overseen the copying of a half-dozen stones from an East Haddam burying ground, said the decision was made to replace some of the older stones with copies after two of the stones were stolen and then returned.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Twiss said it is not just theft that cemetery associations have to worry about.</p>
        <p>''The older stones are starting to show some deterioration, like flaking and cracking,'' Mr. Twiss said. ''Acid rain and pollution have a serious effect on the stones.''</p>
        <p>''It would be a shame, after they've survived this long, to see them go to pieces,'' Mr. Twiss said. ''And to prevent them from falling apart we wanted to get them under cover.''</p>
        <p>Not all cemetery associations are eager to replace old stones. Mr. Fredette recently offered to have replicas made of the Squier stone in the Franklin Congregational Church Cemetery, with two Massachusetts philanthropists, Daniel and Jessica Farber, picking up the cost.</p>
        <p>So far, the cemetery committee has split on the issue, Mr. Wright said.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Fredette is talking from the point of view of preserving art,'' Mr. Wright said, ''and he's absolutely correct. From that point of view, it should be brought inside.''</p>
        <p>''But some of the members would rather take the risk that the stone will be stolen,'' Mr. Wright said. ''The feeling is they would like to have the stone remain in the cemetery. It's tradition, it's their past.''</p>
        <p>And, Mr. Wright said, while he thinks it would be logical to replace the stone before it is stolen or damaged, he can also sympathize with the opponents.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't want my stone taken away by people who want to preserve the art,'' Mr. Wright said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fredette said another problem is that most towns do not have a museum where the stones can be put on display.</p>
        <p>In East Haddam, for instance, the originals of the six stones replaced by the association are locked up in a vault, unavailable for public viewing.</p>
        <p>''We don't have anyplace else to put them at the moment,'' Mr. Twiss said. ''But if we put them back in the cemetery, where people could view them, they'd be stolen again, no question about it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fredette said, however, that the most important thing was to make the replicas, and put the originals under lock and key.</p>
        <p>''Once the stones are saved, we can take as long as we want getting them on display,'' Mr. Fredette said. ''But as long as they're out in the open, there's a danger they will be lost.''</p>
