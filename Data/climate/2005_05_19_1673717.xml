        <p>A coalition of 11 states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, filed a lawsuit yesterday challenging a new federal rule that allows coal-fired power plants to buy pollution credits to avoid lowering their mercury emissions.</p>
        <p>According to the suit, the new rule slows attempts to decrease dangerous mercury emissions and poses grave health risks to those exposed to them. Attorney General Peter C.

        <p>A coalition of 11 states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, filed a lawsuit yesterday challenging a new federal rule that allows coal-fired power plants to buy pollution credits to avoid lowering their mercury emissions.</p>
        <p>According to the suit, the new rule slows attempts to decrease dangerous mercury emissions and poses grave health risks to those exposed to them. Attorney General Peter C. Harvey of New Jersey, acting on behalf of the attorneys general of the other states, filed the suit in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</p>
        <p>When released in the air as a byproduct of burning coal, mercury drifts over lakes and rivers and enters the food chain through fish and shellfish. It is considered a toxic substance that can cause brain damage, especially in infants and small children.</p>
        <p>In March, the Environmental Protection Agency unveiled rules that ordered utilities to reduce mercury emissions by 70 percent by 2018. Power plants that do not exceed a nationwide cap can sell their credits to plants that do.</p>
        <p>Federal officials have likened the system of trading pollution credits to a similar system that has reduced emissions that cause acid rain.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit, however, states that the cap-and trade system would create ''hot spots'' around some plants that purchase the rights to emit more mercury.</p>
        <p>''These rules are deeply flawed and contrary both to science and the law,'' Mr. Harvey said in a statement. The ''E.P.A. has failed to meet its obligation under the Clean Air Act to adopt rules that will protect our children from toxic power plant emissions,'' the statement said.</p>
        <p>The other states suing are California, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Wisconsin.</p>
