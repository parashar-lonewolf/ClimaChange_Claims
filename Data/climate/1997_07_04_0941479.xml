        <p>Hans Blix was not afraid to say the two words no one wanted to hear last week at a conference on the global environment: nuclear energy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blix, a Swedish diplomat, has been director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency since 1981. He says there is a growing gap between public opinion, which on the whole remains fearful of nuclear power plants, and governments and many energy specialists who believe that atomic energy has to be used more if developing nations are to meet their soaring power demands and the world is to have any hope of significantly reducing gases that contribute to global warming.</p>

        <p>Hans Blix was not afraid to say the two words no one wanted to hear last week at a conference on the global environment: nuclear energy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blix, a Swedish diplomat, has been director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency since 1981. He says there is a growing gap between public opinion, which on the whole remains fearful of nuclear power plants, and governments and many energy specialists who believe that atomic energy has to be used more if developing nations are to meet their soaring power demands and the world is to have any hope of significantly reducing gases that contribute to global warming.</p>
        <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency, based in Vienna, is responsible for conducting inspections in search of illegal weapons programs and for promoting nuclear safety at civilian power plants.</p>
        <p>Since the accident at Chernobyl in 1986, Mr. Blix said in an interview, nuclear power safety has been strengthened. He hears less about safety concerns from governments and more about the political problems of expanding atomic power in the face of adverse public opinion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blix, who spoke to the environment conference last week, said that most environmental groups and some international agencies opposed to nuclear power ''are leading us into dreamland'' by calling for reliance on renewable sources like solar power, wind energy and biomass -- or living materials like trees.</p>
        <p>''To achieve the same output of electricity of a 1,000-megawatt power plant,'' he said, ''you would need something like 50 square kilometers of solar cells or 50 square kilometers of windmills or up to 5,000 square kilometers of biomass material. We don't say that's technically impossible. But economically viable? No.''</p>
        <p>But a recent report from the United Nations Development Program looked at a range of energy sources that could supplant coal and oil, studied ways to make present energy sources more efficient. The report concluded that nuclear power was not necessary.</p>
        <p>However, Mr. Blix said that solar power, wind energy and biomass account for only 2.5 percent of the commercial energy used around the world, and that continuing to ''pat renewables on the back and call it conservation'' is akin to being for motherhood.</p>
        <p>''Quantify that,'' he said. ''What does that mean? Are renewables adequate to meet needs?''</p>
        <p>He said that if the world has so far managed to create only 2 percent of its energy from sources that have always been available, that raises the question of how economical or efficient these sources are.</p>
        <p>''Relying on 2 percent of world energy to meet our needs,'' he said, ''is a totally inadequate answer.''</p>
