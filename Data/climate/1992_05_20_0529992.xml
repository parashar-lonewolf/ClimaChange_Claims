        <p>After weeks of deadlock among several House committee chairmen, a complex energy bill is beginning to emerge that would give tax breaks for developing renewable fuels and limit offshore oil drilling.</p>
        <p>Lawmakers could take up the measure as early as Wednesday. No fewer than nine committees have contributed nearly 200 versions and amendments, including expansion of the assets of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and a requirement that utilities help pay the cleanup costs for uranium enrichment plants.</p>
        <p>The House Rules Committee winnowed out several amendments today, and more are expected to fall out in behind-the-scenes negotiations in the days of debate ahead. Fights Expected on House Floor</p>
        <p>Floor fights are expected on whether to streamline nuclear power plant licensing, allow nuclear waste disposal in Nevada and cancel oil drilling leases in Alaska's Bristol Bay, the Florida Everglades and Keys, and North Carolina's Outer Banks.</p>
        <p>The House bill took a big step closer to White House support and final enactment late last week when Representative Henry Waxman, Democrat of California, dropped his insistence on a provision that would curtail carbon dioxide emissions to halt global warming. He did so after President Bush lent conditional support to an international global warming agreement negotiated in New York.</p>
        <p>As the House bill takes form, Representative Philip R. Sharp, Democrat of Indiana, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Energy and Commerce, said it would include "some of the things the President won't like and some things that are closer to his position."</p>
        <p>He said the White House would resist emerging provisions that would limit oil drilling and require oil companies to set aside oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at times when Congress and the President did not appropriate public funds to buy oil for the reserve. But he predicted that Mr. Bush would be pleased by House tax incentives for promotion of alternative fuels and utility changes that would allow non-electric utilities to enter the business of generating electric power to create more competitition. 3 Top Democrats Battle</p>
        <p>The battle over what form the bill will take on the House floor pits Representatives John D. Dingell of Michigan, Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois and George Miller of California, all committee chairmen, in a tangle for influence.</p>
        <p>The Energy and Commerce Committee, headed by Mr. Dingell, approved an energy bill in March that was similar to a version passed by the Senate the month before. While that measure would not streamline nuclear power plant licensing, as the Senate bill would, it followed the Senate by loosening utility regulations. It also joined the Senate in setting targets on Federal agencies to convert their vehicle fleets to phase in use of cars and trucks that use fuels other than gasoline.</p>
        <p>A month later, Mr. Rostenkowski's Ways and Means Committee put a cap of $2.5 billion on utilities for disposing of the refuse from uranium enrichment plants.</p>
        <p>Without the support of Mr. Rostenkowski, the Republicans and a minority of Democrats on his committee eliminated a provision in the Energy Committee's version mandating oil importers and refiners to set aside 1 percent of their oil production to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The panel also approved a variety of revenue provisions would give tax relief to independent oil and gas drillers and tax incentives for vehicles run on alternative energy sources like batteries.</p>
        <p>The most serious challenge to Mr. Dingell came from Mr. Miller and his Interior and Insular Affairs Committee, which generally favors environmental protection measures. Mr. Miller has proposed to strike out of the Energy Committee's version a provision to allow nuclear waste disposal in Nevada's Yucca Mountain, overriding the state's public health and environmental laws.</p>
        <p>"Some of the turf fighting is getting in the way of energy policy," said Bill Magavern, staff attorney for United States Public Interest Research Group, an environmental and consumer organization. "The battles of turf and ego are preventing the chairmen from reaching agreement on nuclear licensing, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and cleaning up nuclear fuel sites."</p>
