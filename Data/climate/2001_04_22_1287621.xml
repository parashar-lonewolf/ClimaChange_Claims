        <p>Editorial on Earth Day and Pres Bush's actions that go against years of environmental protection efforts; sees signs that administration is beginning to take note of polls showing moderate voters do not like his approach</p>

        <p>This Earth Day differs from the celebratory occasions that the environmental community grew accustomed to during the last half of Bill Clinton's tenure. Early on, Mr. Clinton was the despair of conservationists, but he wound up with an exceptional record of achievement. Other modern presidents made big contributions, too. Jimmy Carter set aside huge areas of Alaska as wilderness. Richard Nixon, like Mr. Clinton, was not by instinct an environmentalist, but he had the political sense to give his blessing to the great wave of legislation on clean air, clean water and wilderness protection that Congress approved in the early 1970's.</p>
        <p>George W. Bush seems headed in the opposite direction, although there were signs last week that the White House was beginning to take note of polls showing that moderate voters do not like his approach. One of his first acts was to suspend a half-dozen of the Clinton administration's environmental rules, which Mr. Bush's people persist in labeling ''last-minute'' regulations, though most had been in the works for years. He then embarked on several precipitous moves of his own -- reversing a campaign pledge to cut carbon dioxide emissions, suspending rules requiring mining companies to observe sound environmental practices and weakening enforcement of the Endangered Species Act.</p>

        <p>This Earth Day differs from the celebratory occasions that the environmental community grew accustomed to during the last half of Bill Clinton's tenure. Early on, Mr. Clinton was the despair of conservationists, but he wound up with an exceptional record of achievement. Other modern presidents made big contributions, too. Jimmy Carter set aside huge areas of Alaska as wilderness. Richard Nixon, like Mr. Clinton, was not by instinct an environmentalist, but he had the political sense to give his blessing to the great wave of legislation on clean air, clean water and wilderness protection that Congress approved in the early 1970's.</p>
        <p>George W. Bush seems headed in the opposite direction, although there were signs last week that the White House was beginning to take note of polls showing that moderate voters do not like his approach. One of his first acts was to suspend a half-dozen of the Clinton administration's environmental rules, which Mr. Bush's people persist in labeling ''last-minute'' regulations, though most had been in the works for years. He then embarked on several precipitous moves of his own -- reversing a campaign pledge to cut carbon dioxide emissions, suspending rules requiring mining companies to observe sound environmental practices and weakening enforcement of the Endangered Species Act.</p>
        <p>These were minor affronts to the Clinton legacy. The two defining environmental decisions of Mr. Bush's early months have been his renunciation of the Kyoto agreements on global warming and the beginning of what may be a broad effort to turn the oil and mining industries loose on public lands, many of which deserve special protection.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's decision to abandon Kyoto has international ramifications. Kyoto is a flawed instrument, and the Europeans were foolishly resisting various trading mechanisms that would ease the costs of the treaty without undercutting its objectives. But instead of negotiating a better treaty, Mr. Bush simply pulled out, leaving America without a coherent policy and removing from the bargaining table the world's largest producer of greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>Here at home, meanwhile, Mr. Bush seems bent on carving out large swaths of public land to satisfy his appetite for new energy reserves. His interior secretary, Gale Norton, is talking about making ''boundary adjustments'' to allow commercial activity in some of the 22 national monuments created or expanded by Mr. Clinton. More ominously, his administration has signaled a willingness to retreat from Mr. Clinton's most ambitious conservation measure -- a rule protecting nearly 60 million acres of largely untouched national forest from new oil and gas leasing and most new logging.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's intentions will become clearer when the secretive task force led by Vice President Dick Cheney discloses the administration's energy strategy next month. Nobody doubts the need for a coherent energy plan, and the country is probably willing to cut Mr. Bush some slack in his search for natural gas, the fuel of choice for newer and cleaner power plants. But the polls have also shown that the public is not prepared to sacrifice areas of clear ecological value, whether in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge or the national forests.</p>
        <p>Perhaps mindful of unfavorable polls, the White House has lately been trying to put a better face on things. Three Clinton-era regulations have been allowed to stand. The most important of these was a controversial rule that would greatly restrict the emissions of soot and other pollutants from diesel-powered vehicles. Last week, Christie Whitman, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, announced with great fanfare a decision to support a Clinton administration rule protecting wetlands. It is possible that Mrs. Whitman is pushing the White House toward more enlightened policies. Still, there is something pathetic and potentially deceptive about these triumphal exercises. The occasional decision to uphold existing law should not divert our attention from the more fundamental question of whether Mr. Bush is going to allow his Interior Department to become a captive of the oil and mining industries.</p>
