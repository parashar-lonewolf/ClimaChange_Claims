        <p>PEOPLE really get around. From the poles to the peaks to the ocean floor, humans have probed and cut and burned and drilled and left their mark.</p>
        <p>The human assault on the planet usually does not make headlines unless there is a sudden calamity -- giant fires in Indonesia or radioactivity escaping from a nuclear plant in Chernobyl. So we are most attuned to environmental problems of that kind -- not the subtle, slow types.</p>
        <p>But those subtle, slow-moving processes bear watching. Sometimes, they creep up in surprising ways.</p>
        <p>I got my first such surprise in 1979, when, shortly after college, I ended up serving as first mate on a circumnavigating sailboat. We anchored one day in the lee of an uninhabited volcanic heap of Mars-like rock called Zuqar Island, in the south end of the Red Sea. The island was so remote that one chart labeled it ''terra nullis.'' No one claimed it. If ever a place could be called the middle of nowhere, this was it.</p>
        <p>I felt awfully lucky to be in such an unspoiled place, with black, bed-sized manta rays gliding in the shallows and no sound but the wind and waves.</p>
        <p>I rowed ashore and went for a hike, clambering across a sere landscape of crusty rocks, which cracked underfoot like pottery shards. I reached the windward side and walked to the beach, which was littered, heaped and piled with -- light bulbs.</p>
        <p>There were yardlong fluorescent tubes and heavy spotlights, delicate incandescent globes and flashlight bulbs as big as a pea. They lay in drifts, unbroken, above the highest tide line. Others that had shattered clinked musically with each lapping wave.</p>
        <p>Who could have done such a thing?</p>
        <p>After a moment of reflection, it dawned on me that the light-bulb litter was not the fault of any individual. It must have been a consequence of the incessant parade of container and cargo ships plying the Red Sea. I envisioned a tanker crewman on his night watch unscrewing a burned-out bulb and, without a thought, tossing it over.</p>
        <p>Over the years, ship after passing ship would add up to a lot of bulbs bobbing around. Every once in a while, one would be carried by a wave or the wind far enough above the island's surf line that it would remain an unseen icon of the modern age.</p>
        <p>I was not a reporter then, but things like piles of light bulbs on a faraway beach made me want to write about the effect of humans on the environment. Once I became a journalist, I began reporting on all kinds of environmental issues. One small story, in a way, summed up a lot.</p>
        <p>It was about a construction crew in the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles that  had been digging a hole for a parking-lot foundation. The crew reached a certain depth, and suddenly gasoline began welling up from the earth.</p>
        <p>They had not struck a hidden pipeline. The gasoline, as it turned out, had leaked from a buried, rusting storage tank at a service station a few hundred yards away. It had been leaking almost indiscernibly for years, quart by quart, pooling atop the aquifer in the porous soil and drifting down the block, waiting for someone to dig a hole.</p>
        <p>I saw the results of a similar slow degradation a few years ago when I spent time with an Indian tribe in Kitamaat Village, on the coast of British Columbia, about 500 miles north of Vancouver. The village is  across a bay from a large aluminum refinery built by Alcan Aluminum.</p>
        <p>In his office, the elected chief of the Haisla tribe, Gerald Amos, showed me a glass pint jar half-filled with mercury. He said a Haisla contractor had been hired to take down a work shed on the Alcan property. While dismantling a toilet, he undid the U-shaped trap in the plumbing and found it full of the liquid metal. Someone must have been pouring something containing mercury down the toilet for years, which left a constant residue trapped in the pipes.</p>
        <p>In an ideal world, we could look ahead a few decades and figure out that dumping a few dribs of mercury down a toilet, or dropping a bulb over the rail, might eventually have an undesirable effect.</p>
        <p>But often the offending activity seems so  innocuous that it hardly registers on a person's consciousness, let alone his conscience. It's just one bulb, right?</p>
        <p>And, of course, we don't live in an ideal world. We actually live in a very muddled, complicated one. As a result, even when people do think ahead, they can end up taking the wrong action.</p>
        <p>Brazil, for example, passed laws decades ago protecting the valuable Brazil nut trees of the Amazon. When ranchers cleared rain  forests, towering specimens of the tree remained -- standing alone on otherwise denuded land. But without the surrounding forest, the bees that pollinated the Brazil nut flowers could not thrive, so few of the remaining trees produce nuts.</p>
        <p>NATURE'S complexity can also hide early signs that we are having an impact.</p>
        <p>Even something as big as a sharp shift in climate as a result of human pollution can be hard to see immediately. For one thing, its first manifestations -- the baby steps -- can be obscured by all the natural variability in the natural world.</p>
        <p>Year by year, decade by decade, the globe has its complement of hot flashes and cold spells, thanks to El Nino and La Nina, a squiggly jet stream and the rest.</p>
        <p>As Starley Thompson, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., put it, the challenge of recognizing global warming amid the ups and downs of weather is like trying to discern cornstalks rising in a weedy field.</p>
        <p>In Dr. Thompson's scenario, at first there are lots of green sprouting things; at some point, the cornstalks finally stand out, clear  for everyone to see. With climate change, it's all still a bit weedy.</p>
        <p>What it boils down to is that you will never read a front-page headline that says  ''Earth's Temperature Soars Overnight -- Coasts Flooded, Crops Ruined.'' All those things may happen, but spread over decades and scattered across the globe.</p>
        <p>So we're a little stuck. We have the general idea that bad things may come from doubling the amount of heat-trapping gases in the air as a result of burning fossil fuels. But because there is much disagreement -- and more uncertainty -- about the precise dimensions of the problem, we find it hard to settle on a set of concrete actions to cut these so-called greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>It may be that we are condemned to mounting belated, intensive responses once the consequences of slow shifts are evident.</p>
        <p>That might not be so bad. After all, humans have a good track record at crash programs: the United States did O.K. after being jogged by Sputnik, Pearl Harbor and other surprises. And there can be unanticipated benefits from doing nothing. Sometimes, problems take care of themselves.</p>
        <p>Consider all those stranded light bulbs in the Red Sea. No need to go clean them up. Let global warming raise the sea level slightly, and they may simply float away.</p>
