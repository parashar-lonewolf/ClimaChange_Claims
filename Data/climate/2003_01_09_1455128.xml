        <p>Gov George E Pataki of New York says he opposes raising taxes or postponing planned tax cuts, but that deep reductions in core state services would be needed to close state's $2 billion budget gap, annual adddress to State Legislature; says state cannot settle for politically expedient solutions, but must aim for larger goals of growing state economy and creating jobs, particularly in technology; aides and allies to Democratic Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver point out that Pataki failed to say what cuts in state budget he would make, or how he stands on other issues pending before Legislature; Pataki says only that his proposed state budget would amount to less than current one and that with exception of public security, no segment of budget will be exempt; that seems to indicate spending cuts in areas like education and health care, areas that Pataki promoted during his campaign just two months ago; photo (M)</p>

        <p>Saying the state must continue to foster economic growth and look past the current fiscal crisis, Gov. George E.

        <p>Saying the state must continue to foster economic growth and look past the current fiscal crisis, Gov. George E. Pataki said today that he opposed raising taxes or postponing planned tax cuts. He also suggested that deep reductions in core state services would be needed to close an enormous state budget gap.</p>
        <p>Even as he acknowledged a deficit of $2 billion this year and ''several times larger'' in the fiscal year that begins on April 1, Mr. Pataki said the state must not settle for politically expedient solutions but aim for the larger goals of a growing state economy and a relentless push to create jobs, particularly in technology.</p>
        <p>''We face a fiscal crisis today of a magnitude that we have not faced in our lifetime,'' Mr. Pataki, a Republican, said in his annual address to the State Legislature. ''How we meet this challenge will be crucial in shaping the legacy we leave our children and grandchildren. It will require tough decisions, but we have made them before and they have worked.''</p>
        <p>Aides and allies to the Democratic speaker of the Assembly, Sheldon Silver, immediately replied that the governor's speech, which lasted 55 minutes, was remarkable not only for what it said, but for what it left out. Notable among the omissions, they said, were what Mr. Pataki intends to cut in the state budget and how he stands on other issues pending before the Legislature, including the renewal of rent control laws and aid to New York City.</p>
        <p>Certain omissions, like the governor's intentions for state spending on education, also gnawed at Republicans who control the State Senate, though the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, endorsed the speech.</p>
        <p>Many saw the address as a tacking back to mainstream Republicanism for the three-term governor, who co-opted some Democratic principles to win a landslide election last year.</p>
        <p>As in any year in the state capital, Mr. Pataki's political priorities will come alive in the lines of his proposed state budget, projected to be $89.6 billion. It will be closely scrutinized, many politicians and budget analysts said, when Mr. Pataki issues it at month's end, setting the stage for what promises to be a particularly acrimonious round of political fighting and posturing that could last to summer or beyond.</p>
        <p>In addressing the shortfall, Mr. Pataki said the coming budget would amount to less than the current one. ''With the exception of public security,'' he said, ''no segment of the budget will be exempt.''</p>
        <p>That one sentence seemed to open the door to deep spending cuts, even in areas like education and health care. The governor had promoted programs in those areas during his campaign just two months ago.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Pataki did his best in his speech to portray the sunniest parts of his time in office. As he did last year, he basked in the patriotic spirit in New York that lingers from Sept. 11, 2001. He highlighted the achievements of his past eight years, saying they provided a road map for success. He invoked a need to leave the state financially pristine for ''our children and grandchildren.''</p>
        <p>Those children, he said, should pay lower taxes than residents do today, and he vowed to help their parents and grandparents by continuing scheduled tax cuts and maintaining tax-subsidy programs like the STAR program, which pays local school district taxes for older homeowners.</p>
        <p>''While other states raise taxes, let us out-compete any state and create new jobs by maintaining New York's eight-year record as the tax-cutting capital of America,'' he said to a round of applause in the packed Assembly chamber where his wife, Libby, and his mother, Margaret, sat near Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and others.</p>
        <p>The governor urged lawmakers to rise above partisanship to get the job done and, to make his point, singled out former Gov. Hugh L. Carey, and Mr. Carey's friend turned opponent, former Lt. Gov. Mary Anne Krupsak, for praise.</p>
        <p>Then he made a joke, saying, ''Now, if only Betsy were here,'' a reference to Betsy McCaughey Ross, his former lieutenant governor, with whom he had a falling out. Laughter filled the chamber.</p>
        <p>But the cheer soon subsided. During many moments in the governor's address, the Democrats in the chamber sat silently, with arms folded in laps, as Republicans clapped, hooted, or occasionally stood.</p>
        <p>Just five minutes after the speech ended, the party lines were drawn, and the Capitol hallways had a carnival flavor as various constituencies promoted their positions. Many Democrats said the governor seemed to assign his fewest words to the present and his most to the past and future. It was mostly platitudes, they contended, and not substance.</p>
        <p>''In these times of hardship, inspirational words are nice, but action is eloquence,'' Mr. Silver said. Then he laced into the governor's style, saying, ''We need real leadership now.''</p>
        <p>Many opponents bristled when Mr. Pataki seemed to place full blame for the budget mess on the Sept. 11 terrorist attack , not mentioning that he and the Legislature had allowed state spending to grow at three times the rate of inflation in the four previous budgets. Alan G. Hevesi, the new state comptroller, a Democrat, called the governor's analysis simplistic.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki also sprinkled several announcements into the address. He announced that Advanced Micro Devices, one of the largest chip manufacturing companies in the world, was starting a venture with I.B.M. in the Hudson Valley.</p>
        <p>He announced the appointment of Jim Natoli, a former director of state operations, as director of disaster preparedness and response. He said the state was beginning an alliance with Quebec to try to entice a future Winter Olympics to the New York-Canadian border.</p>
        <p>He also spoke of many efforts to benefit the upstate region, including a new state park that would turn Gallagher Beach into a ''great new recreational facility'' for Buffalo and western New York.</p>
        <p>He outlined some well-established goals, too, that would help secure Mr. Pataki's legacy if the Legislature adopts them. On the environment, Mr. Pataki called for adopting the carbon dioxide emission standards for motor vehicles that were recently proposed by California, and said that within 10 years at least a quarter of all the electricity bought in New York would come from renewable energy resources like solar or wind power. He called again for reducing the state's mandatory sentences for drug crimes, and pledged support for campaign finance reform.</p>
        <p>On the budget front, it remains to be seen whether Mr. Pataki can impose his fiscally conservative agenda on the Legislature. The Assembly speaker has already declared that cuts to education and health care spending are out of the question.</p>
        <p>As for the Republican house, Mr. Bruno, the Senate majority leader, endorsed the governor's strong stand against taxes, and said he might even advocate more tax cuts.</p>
        <p>Other Republicans said attempts to cut education aid to localities and health care would be unpalatable.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki made a glancing reference to Medicaid, which pays for health care for the poor, saying he would continue to try to reduce the cost of the program. Medicaid is the largest part of the state budget, accounting for more than $30 billion.</p>
        <p>The governor also said that he would aim to privatize certain state assets, and that he would borrow $4 billion backed by the annual payment the state receives from the tobacco companies as part of a court settlement. He said he would try to avoid layoffs, but would work with labor unions to further reduce the size of the state work force.</p>
        <p>Along with being silent on renewal of the city's rent laws, which ground the legislative process to a halt in 1997, when they were last revamped, he said nothing about tuition increases at city and state universities, though the board of trustees is scheduled to consider such increases on Friday. He did not mention a tax on commuters to New York City.</p>
        <p>Mayor Bloomberg left Albany empty-handed. Nonetheless, he praised the speech. ''I don't think the governor has any objection to reforming the tax structure,'' he said, referring to the commuter tax, and he expressed confidence that Mr. Pataki would come through for the fiscally troubled city in the final budget.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hevesi, the comptroller, was more critical. ''He left us, if he sticks to this, with huge cuts in programs and/or borrowing,'' he said. ''What this speech doesn't do is deal with the main issue, and that is the $11 billion deficit.''</p>
