        <p>LEAD: The shot that killed Francisco Mendes Filho last week in Brazil may not have been heard round the world, though it was reported on page 1 of The New York Times.

        <p>The shot that killed Francisco Mendes Filho last week in Brazil may not have been heard round the world, though it was reported on page 1 of The New York Times. But Mr. Mendes's violent death may at least further alert global authorities to the dangers of deforestation - an environmental abuse he fought so effectively that he probably was murdered by the land exploiters he opposed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mendes was a founder and organizer of the union of rubber tappers, whose traditional - and environmentally sound - way of life in the Amazon jungle was threatened by indiscriminate land clearance. At his death, he was the most prominent leader of the rubber tappers, the recognized national spokesman for their interests and the recipient of a Global 500 award from the U.N. Environmental Project for his work in forest protection.</p>
        <p>His life had been threatened, he said recently, by local landowners, and yesterday the son of one of them claimed to have hired the killer. In the remote regions of the Amazon, such violence is not unusual, and Mr. Mendes had made enemies with his determined battle against further destruction of the tropical forest. He and his followers were credited with saving literally thousands of hectares from the bulldozer. (A hectare is about 2.5 acres.) But far more of Brazil's rich ''tropical moist forest'' is gone forever -lost not just to the rubber tappers who ''harvested'' it without damaging or exploiting it, but to the wildlife whose habitat and ecosystems have been destroyed, to the food and timber uses it might have served and to populations all over the world who depend on the chlorophyllic action of plants and trees to keep the earth's atmosphere from excessive pollution.</p>
        <p>That dependence is rapidly becoming precarious. Emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere have increased in recent years from about 1.5 billion tons annually to more than five billion tons. In the first half of the 21st century, carbon dioxide concentration in the air will be about double that of pre-industrial times; that will contribute heavily to the so-called ''greenhouse effect,'' expected to raise the earth's temperatures.</p>
        <p>Francisco Mendes thus fought not only the rubber tappers' battle, but the whole planet's. Moreover, the assault to which he responded in the far-off jungles of the Amazon was not merely the product of shortsighted Brazilian development policies. It resulted also from the rising demand in the United States for cheap beef to make the Big Macs and Whoppers on which the new fast-food industry was thriving. Pasture-fed cattle from Latin America were an economical alternative to grain-fed beef from North America.</p>
        <p>So Brazil embarked on a self-destructive course: tax credits, exemptions and deductions, as well as subsidized loans, for private entrepreneurs to invest in cattle ranching. Inevitably, these economic seductions led to the large-scale conversion of forest land to pasture - though the forest was far more valuable, inherently and perhaps even economically, than pasture. Between 1965 and 1983, 469 large cattle ranches, averaging 23,000 hectares each, were established in the Amazon region. Twenty-five percent of this land - by my calculation, about 10,517 square miles -actually was cleared by 1983.</p>
        <p>The result, through 1983, was a $2.5 billion government investment, in effect subsidizing irredeemable deforestation and land degradation. For most of the entrepreneurs Mr. Mendes fought so hard, profits were immense.</p>
        <p>Brazil is by no means the only offender. Every year, throughout the world, about 11 million acres of tropical forests and woodlands are destroyed - mostly to clear land for agriculture to feed growing populations, or to supply exchange-earning exports. At present rates of loss, by the end of the decade 2007-2017, several countries will have destroyed all their forests: Nigeria, the Ivory Coast, Sri Lanka, Costa Rica, El Salvador.</p>
        <p>Thus the kind of fight that Mr. Mendes waged literally to his death was of concern far beyond the Amazon - as are ozone depletion, acid rain, toxic wastes, desertification, ocean spoilage, diminishing resources, rising population and numerous other impending crises.</p>
        <p>No more serious problems face George Bush, as he prepares to become President, with all the influence that office can exert on world development and conservation practices. Mr. Bush has made a good start with his nomination of William Reilly to head the Environmental Protection Agency. But even so experienced an environmentalist can have real impact on these global problems only if they are given the highest priority by a President as determined, in his way, as Francisco Mendes Filho was, in his.</p>
