        <p>It was an idea that seemed well-founded. Instead of paying enormous salaries to unproven players like Shawn Bradley and Glenn Robinson, install a rookie salary scale that would not reward the league's young players until they had three years under their belt.</p>
        <p>But less than three years after the owners and the players agreed to the plan, it has gone bust in a number of ways. It has not helped teams keep franchise players or necessarily helped the league's out-of-whack economics.</p>
        <p>Of the 13 lottery picks in 1995, only 3 have remained with the team that drafted them. And two of those three players -- Kevin Garnett in Minnesota and Bryant Reeves in Vancouver -- signed such extraordinary deals that their franchises must find creative ways to keep competitive rosters intact.</p>
        <p>Last week, the No. 1 pick from that draft, Joe Smith, and the No. 7 pick, Damon Stoudamire, were dealt for the sole reason that the teams that drafted them felt they were not prepared to pay $100 million to keep them, or that no matter what amount of money they offered in the off season, the players would bolt.</p>
        <p>''It's really a sad state of affairs,'' Golden State General Manager Garry St. Jean said recently. ''You have a guy for three years and you barely have a chance to evaluate him and he's gone.''</p>
        <p>In the Warriors case, they simply did not feel Smith was worth the financial commitment.</p>
        <p>The former players association executive directors Charles Grantham and Simon Guordine helped put together the current deal.</p>
        <p>But the owners actually created the problem by giving up the right of first refusal during labor negotiations in the summer of 1995.</p>
        <p>Instead of a team having the right to match another team's offer to their free agents, a player can now simply bolt.</p>
        <p>''The flip side to the deal is that players can feel like they are sort of serving just an apprenticeship and the dynamics about how players feel about their teams change,'' said Russ Granik, the league's deputy commissioner. ''I felt at the time that the owners gave up a lot by giving up a right of first refusal.''</p>
        <p>While some players have benefited greatly -- Garnett's $126 million deal is the sterling example -- the structure has created a league of disparate salaries, a National Basketball Association of haves and have-nots.</p>
        <p>There is a good chance the collective bargaining agreement will be reopened in April by the owners, who have the unilateral right to do so.</p>
        <p>There is an even better chance that the current rookie scale will be up for intense debate and, possibly, change.</p>
        <p>''The way things are now, something has got to give,'' Kevin McHale, Minnesota's vice president of basketball operations, said recently.</p>
        <p>''There's no stability and it's near impossible to keep a playoff team together in a small market. And often times, three years after you're done putting all the effort into teaching and nurturing, your player is gone to someone else.''</p>
        <p>The Balk Move</p>
        <p>Eric Montross, Sam Cassell and Jim Jackson might have substantial arguments to make about not reporting to the next team they are traded to. Playing for four different teams apiece over the past year, they have been at the system's mercy.</p>
        <p>If Montross (Boston, Dallas, Nets, Philadelphia), Cassell (Houston, Phoenix, Dallas and the Nets) and Jackson (Dallas, Nets, Philadelphia, Golden State) held out for a clothing stipend to accommodate each climate change, people would understand.</p>
        <p>But what happened prior to Thursday's deadline -- Kenny Anderson refusing to report to Toronto and Rony Seikaly failing to show in Utah -- has the league worried and perhaps thinking about amendments to its current trade-and-report rules.</p>
        <p>''If it becomes more and more prevalent, that's a definite concern,'' said Russ Granik, the N.B.A's deputy commissioner. ''When our players don't report on trades, it's a little disturbing.''</p>
        <p>Section 10 of the uniform player contract states that if players fail to report in the 48-hour window after a trade, they can be suspended without pay. Orlando was apparently prepared to exercise that clause with Seikaly before the Jazz voided the deal.</p>
        <p>Anderson's situation was even more troubling. Soon after he was traded for Damon Stoudamire, he steadfastly refused to play for Toronto. Rather than deal with the ramifications of a disgruntled player, the Raptors settled for the Celtics rookie Chauncey Billups instead.</p>
        <p>Though the Raptors gained an improving forward in Gary Trent and another promising rookie in Alvin Williams from the Portland deal, Toronto General Manager Glen Grunwald essentially found himself taking Boston's unwanted baggage off his hands and giving up much more than the franchise could have had for Stoudamire, one of the most coveted players of the last two months.</p>
        <p>Several well-documented tales of agents and players going into conniptions after they were informed of a potential trade led to the demise of several deals, including one in which Stoudamire was supposed to go to Orlando in a three-way deal that would have brought Anfernee Hardaway to the Nets.</p>
        <p>''There were a lot of rumors out there, so we don't know what all was true,'' Granik said. ''We'll take some time to digest what's happened before we make any recommendations.''</p>
        <p>Trade Talk</p>
        <p>Several of the key trades over the last 10 days invite additional comment:</p>
        <p>*Rony Seikaly and Brian Evans to the Nets, and David Benoit, Kevin Edwards and Yinka Dare to the Magic. Comment: Nets add a bona-fide, if quirky, center to bolster playoff hopes, and rid themselves of two players who may not be in the league next year along with a small-time role player (Benoit).</p>
        <p>*Jim Jackson and Clarence Weatherspoon to the Warriors, and Joe Smith and Brian Shaw to the 76ers. Comment: The Warriors freed more salary cap room by dealing for the free-agents-to-be Jackson and Weatherspoon, and they also got rid of two Latrell Sprewell loyalists. The 76ers didn't do too badly, either. They can find out if Smith is worth the commitment while dumping two players they were not going to invest in over the summer.</p>
        <p>*Brent Barry to the Heat, and Isaac Austin, Charles Smith and a No. 1 draft pick to the Clippers. Comment: This is what the league's salary structure has come to: Pat Riley traded away Austin, a hard-as-nails player whom he helped mold into one of the league's top big men, for a pillowy-soft West Coast guy who can pass and shoot but does not do defense. The Clippers get a rebounding presence for at least three months, but not much more. With neither club wanting to lose solid role players for nothing, this was akin to two used-car salesmen trying to get rid of vehicles they knew were going to be repossessed by the bank.
