        <p>When Senator Frank H. Murkowski of Alaska, the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, introduced his broad energy proposal, he made sure to publicly thank, by name, the many lobbying groups who helped shape the bill.</p>
        <p>The praise was well deserved. The legislation is loaded with tax breaks for the oil, coal and nuclear energy industries. It also seeks to lift a ban on oil drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a proposal that has sparked a fierce and expensive lobbying war.</p>
        <p>This week the coal and oil industries got more good news. President Bush, reversing a campaign pledge, decided not to try to curb power plants' emissions of carbon dioxide, which many say causes global warming. The decision, which came after industry lobbyists and Republican lawmakers pressured Mr. Bush, sent a shudder through environmental advocacy groups.</p>
        <p>These back-to-back successes illustrate the influence of the oil, coal and nuclear energy industries now that Republicans are in control of  Capitol Hill and the White House. But perhaps the greatest test to their new-found power over the environmental groups will come in the months ahead as Congress grapples with the question of drilling in the Arctic refuge.</p>
        <p>''Our hope is that the new administration will bring balance to the debate,'' said Jack Gerard, president and chief executive officer of the National Mining Association, who was a member of Mr. Bush's energy advisory group during the transition. ''They will say, 'How do we find that middle ground?' ''</p>
        <p>Just as environmental groups contributed lavishly to Democrats, the oil, gas and coal industries directed record-breaking sums to Republicans in the last election. Oil and gas companies and their trade groups contributed a total of $14 million in 1999 and 2000, with more than $10 million going to Republicans, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan election research group. The coal mining industry gave $3.8 million, 88 percent of it to Republicans.</p>
        <p>But the industry's power extends far beyond cash donations. The White House is stocked with former oil executives, beginning with Mr. Bush, who led his own oil company in Texas. Others with ties to the industry include Vice President Dick Cheney, who has created an energy task force; Donald L. Evans, the commerce secretary; and Condoleezza Rice, national security adviser.</p>
        <p>The automobile industry is also well represented. Andrew H. Card Jr., Mr. Bush's chief of staff, was formerly chief lobbyist for General Motors, and Spencer Abraham, the energy secretary, a former Republican senator from Michigan, reaped more campaign donations from the automobile industry last year than any other lawmaker, the Center for Responsive Politics said.</p>
        <p>Energy industry lobbyists say the benefits of such well-placed allies  are obvious: oil, coal and nuclear energy companies are no longer the presumed villains, and access to the White House is no longer a problem.</p>
        <p>''After not talking to the White House for eight years, it's a bit of fresh air,'' said Roger Herrera, executive director of Arctic Power, a group with the sole purpose of lobbying for drilling in the Arctic refuge.</p>
        <p>As the House and the White House prepare to overhaul Senator Murkowski's bill in the coming weeks, no energy battle looms larger than the one over drilling in the refuge, a stretch of tundra on Alaska's North Slope.</p>
        <p>The issue is expected to come up first in April or May, as part of Congress's budget resolution, and the drilling is supported by President Bush. The proposal narrowly passed the Senate last year but was dropped from the budget resolution.</p>
        <p>Environmental groups argue that the refuge, which is protected from oil exploration until Congress says otherwise, should be sacrosanct. Oil drilling, they say, would hurt the land, would endanger migrating caribou and polar bears, and would not recover enough crude to make the effort worthwhile.</p>
        <p>''There is unified opposition to drilling in the Arctic,'' said Betsy Loyless, political director for the League of Conservation Voters. ''The environmental community will pull out all the stops for a big win.''</p>
        <p>Several groups have already mobilized. This week, the Audubon Society began a television advertising campaign that features caribou and geese running across the refuge in summer, then shifts to a shot of the Exxon Valdez tanker. The commercial asks, ''Do we really believe there won't be any more spills?''</p>
        <p>The group has also set up a Web site that enables people to send letters directly to Congress and is holding what it calls house parties in 11  states. Defenders of Wildlife, a national conservation group, set up a Web site in January that has generated 800,000 e-mail messages and faxes to Congress.</p>
        <p>But what their opponents lack in mobilizing the grass roots, they make up for in money and powerful connections.</p>
        <p>Arctic Power, a nonprofit group formed in 1992, includes oil industry officials, Alaska union leaders and business groups on its board.</p>
        <p>''We're running it to the extent that we can like a political campaign because that's what it is,'' said the group's leader, Mr. Herrera, a former oil company geologist. ''The environmentalists are throwing tens of thousands of people at this. I hope we can match them in political strategy.''</p>
        <p>Drilling supporters say environmentalists are purposely exaggerating the potential for damage and underestimating the amount of oil in the refuge, which Mr. Herrera said could prove to be the largest oil field in the world. They also point out that only 1.5 million of the refuge's 19 million acres would be available for drilling and that new technology has made oil exploration more sensitive to the environment.</p>
        <p>In the last few weeks, Arctic Power has hired the well-connected lobbying firm of Patton Boggs. It has also hired Qorvis, a public relations firm, and Alex Castellanos, the media consultant who worked with President Bush on his campaign advertisements. The group plans to preview its own television and radio advertisements next week.</p>
        <p>Arctic Power expects the oil industry to step up its efforts in the battle over the refuge in the coming months. The State of Alaska, which stands to benefit from lifting the ban, has taken the lead in lobbying and has given $1.75 million to the group.</p>
        <p>The group also has powerful allies on the Hill. Senator Murkowski, whose bill seeks to increase energy production and reduce reliance on foreign oil, has spearheaded the campaign for drilling. The effort has the support of the rest of the Alaska delegation: Senator Ted Stevens, the  chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and Representative Don Young, chairman of the Transportation Committee.</p>
        <p>Many Republicans and some Democrats say it is time to curb the influence of environmental groups and become more pragmatic. Power failures in California, and this winter's steep natural gas prices, have helped their arguments.</p>
        <p>''We're not going to be talking about rolling back existing protections,'' said Representative Billy Tauzin, a Louisiana Republican who is chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. ''We're talking about finding ways to achieve those results in a more flexible manner.''</p>
