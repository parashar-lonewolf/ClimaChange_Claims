        <p>LEAD: Everyone wants clean air. But who should pay for it?</p>
        <p>Everyone wants clean air. But who should pay for it?</p>
        <p>Congress is grappling with that question once again as it tries to rewrite the Clean Air Act of 1970, and the lawmakers are taking positions that vividly demonstrate why many attempts to strengthen the law in the 1980's have failed.</p>
        <p>''Everyone realizes that we need to clean up the environment, but no one likes the costs,'' Representative Carlos J. Moorhead, Republican of California, said this week at a Congressional hearing on clean air legislation.</p>
        <p>Few political issues pit region against region and industry against industry the way cleaning up the air does. The high stakes, which can be measured in jobs, profits and public health, are reflected in the legislators' zealous defense of their districts' interests. Efforts to Soften the Bill</p>
        <p>In coming weeks, vigorous efforts are expected to be made to soften the impact of proposed clean air legislation on special interests, including utilities and their customers in Middle Western states, coal miners in Appalachia, auto makers and oil companies. These moves will be fiercely resisted not only by those seeking as strict a clean air law as possible but also by those who would have to pay for any attempts sharing the burden of new laws.</p>
        <p>Efforts to pass costs from one region to another will also face opposition from President Bush, whose legislation to overhaul the Clean Air Act is the subject of hearings in the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.</p>
        <p>Describing the program as a well-balanced and ''coherent whole,'' John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, said Friday in an interview: ''We're not going to be stubborn about adjustments or pieces that are in it, but let's not make a drastic change.''</p>
        <p>Despite the promise of battles, most members say Congress will pass a tougher Clean Air Act either this year or next, given the President's strong support for such a measure and opinion polls showing that the public favors stricter environmental laws. Bipartisan Support for Bill Mr. Bush's bill has bipartisan support, which is highlighted by its sponsorship in the House by Representative John D. Dingell, a Democrat from Michigan who is chairman of the energy committee, where clean air legislation originates. Mr. Dingell, whose constitutents include the nation's auto makers, had long opposed efforts to toughen the Clean Air Act.</p>
        <p>The President's plan addresses three threats to the environment: acid rain, smog and emissions of hazardous chemicals. Each part of the package has generated criticism, but most of the complaints have been reserved for the proposals aimed at reducing acid rain and smog.</p>
        <p>Conflicts over acid rain have long divided the country by region and by industry and are a major reason the Clear Air Act has not been amended since 1977. William D. Ruckelshaus, the former head of the Environmental Protection Agency, once said that if he talked to someone about acid rain for five minutes, he could tell which state the person came from.</p>
        <p>Acid rain occurs when sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions change chemically in the atmosphere and return to the earth as rain, fog or snow. Acidic precipitation damages lakes, forests and buildings, and, some scientists say, may harm human health.</p>
        <p>The burning of fossil fuels by electric utilities accounts for 75 percent of the sulfur dioxide emitted in the United States. Fifty power plants, many of them in the Middle West, are responsible for about 50 percent of all sulfur dioxide emissions. Other industry contributes about 20 percent of the sulfur dioxide, and transportation sources, about 5 percent. Limit for Sulfur Dioxide</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush wants to cut the emissions by about half, or 10 million tons a year, by 2000, at a cost the Administration estimates at more than $20 billion. Another provision would limit emissions to the amount generated in 2000. Utilities would be allowed to buy and sell the right to pollute, a market-based approach the White House hopes will reduce the cost of cutting emissions.</p>
        <p>There is broad agreement among members of Congress that a reduction of 10 million tons in sulfur dioxide emissions is a worthy goal, but the amity ends there.</p>
        <p>Representative Philip R. Sharp, Democrat of Indiana, said that under the President's bill, nine Middle Western and Southeastern states would have to clean up 77 percent of the sulfur dioxide although the states are responsible for half of it. That would add dramatically to utility costs and customers' bills in the region, said Mr. Sharp, the chairman of the House subcommittee on energy and power, at a hearing this week.</p>
        <p>One way for the Middle Western utilities to clean up emissions would be to switch from the high-sulfur coal on which they rely to more expensive natural gas or low-sulfur coal. .</p>
        <p>The United Mine Workers of America estimates such a move would cost from 22,000 to 30,000 jobs in Appalachia and the Middle West, where high-sulfur coal is produced. Job gains in low-sulfur coal fields in places like Wyoming would not make up for losses elsewhere, said Bill Samuel, a legislative representative for the union.</p>
        <p>''We're not interested in shifting job opportunities from state to state,'' Mr. Samuel said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharp and others favor spreading the cost of cleaning the air, asserting that it is a national problem akin to the bailout of the savings and loan industry. Such burden-sharing approaches include subsidizing utilities' costs for installing antipollution devices and taxing utilities that use natural gas to generate electricity.</p>
        <p>But William K. Reilly, the head the Environmental Protection Agency, said the Middle West was being asked to pay only in proportion to what it contributes to the acid rain problem. He also said average electricity costs in the region, which are below the national average, would increase only slightly if the President's bill was enacted.</p>
        <p>Utilities in other regions like the West, which have already dramatically reduced sulfur dioxide emissions at great expense, say they are not interested in helping their Middle Western cousins.</p>
        <p>The President's proposal to combat smog has also split Congress. Some members contend that the legislation, which has been estimated to cost $3 billion to $4 billion a year, does not go far enough to control motor vehicle pollution. In the House, the fight to toughen pollution controls pits Representative Henry A. Waxman, a Democrat who represents smog-ridden Los Angeles, against Representative Dingell.</p>
        <p>As chairman of the health and environment subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Waxman has fought for most of the decade to reduce emissions from cars. But his efforts have been stymied by Mr. Dingell, the committee's chairman, who says the auto companies have already done their share in antipollution efforts.</p>
        <p>If clean air legislation is to pass in this session of Congress, compromise will be essential, several members said.</p>
        <p>Some people ''would rather argue over the color of the wallpaper than build the house,'' said Representative Gerry Sikorski, Democrat of Minnesota. ''Everyone will have to swallow hard.''</p>
