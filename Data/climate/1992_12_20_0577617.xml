        <p>For the first time in its history, the Metropolitan Museum has mounted a one-person exhibition of a contemporary Japanese artist, and lo and behold, the artist is a photographer. Thirty-five color photographs by Shomei Tomatsu -- "Photographs by Tomatsu: Sakura + Plastics" -- propose a complex opposition. Rectangular, 35-millimeter pictures focus on pink cherry blossoms ("sakura"); they hang next to dark, nearly square photographs of plastics washed up on the beach. Though both series appear to be chiefly about visual pleasure, Tomatsu's vision of flowers turns out to be as ambiguous as his orderly images of pollution. The damaged environment beckons seductively; the prodigious displays of spring harbor hints of darkness.</p>
        <p>His work, which in the late 1950's and 60's influenced such Japanese artists as the film maker Akira Kurosawa, has a certain authority and reserved elegance but breaks no new ground. In the cherry-tree pictures, blossom and branch, seen close on, choke the surface with a vigorous, wiry calligraphy the Abstract Expressionists would have admired. Lee Friedlander staked out this territory in black and white, in Japan, some dozen years ago, and long before, Japanese artists filled screens with snaking branches and soft explosions of blossom.</p>
        <p>The brief moment of cherry-tree splendor is so highly prized in Japan that during the season radio and television broadcast hourly reports on the degree of bloom. The blossom is traditionally regarded as a symbol of Japanese culture -- and was also the emblem of military Japan until 1945.</p>
        <p>Tomatsu removes the compositional strategies of a Friedlander from the realm of pure esthetics and revises them to serve his culture's darker memories. A few images begin to slip loose from their pastel moorings, as when a lovely profusion of blooms reveals a small black form that might be a dead bird caught in a branch.</p>
        <p>The sand in the beach pictures is graphite and black with tiny glints of white, as if the night sky had been imprinted on the shore, and an oddly radiant light steals in. Bits of plastic in hard, bright hues have come to rest beside dead crabs and broken shells. These images depend less on nature's drawing than on shapes, improbable bursts of color and the prickly texture of sand.</p>
        <p>Seen from directly overhead, the space flattens out entirely and plays host to large, floating forms or a spatter of small, isolated shapes -- compositions that might have been borrowed from abstract painters like Adolf Gottlieb or Larry Poons. Wind and tide may have made these arrangements, but a knowledgeable eye isolated them in the viewfinder. Irritatingly, the museum has surrounded these pictures with mottled green mats that fight the photographs every inch of the way.</p>
        <p>Plastic bottles that have been mauled into suggestive biomorphic shapes and then regurgitated by the sea assume faintly obscene identities, recalling Tomatsu's own well-known image of a bottle melted into near illegibility by the Nagasaki bomb. In the long run, the destruction implied by garbage thrown up by the sea may be just as poisonous. More than three decades ago, Tomatsu took a series of pictures of Nagasaki and the survivors of the bomb, and he has since taken many photographs of natural and unnatural threats to the environment.</p>
        <p>The cherry blossom and beach debris</p>
        <p>pictures belong to a specialized branch of landscape photography that has no name: the charged landscape, the environment as parable, propaganda or morality play. Landscape photography arose in the 19th century when landscape came into its own as an</p>
        <p>independent subject in painting and the idea grew that nature itself was a work of art. Not long after the genre began, the awesome and beautiful landscape photograph, though it seemed designed solely for esthetic delight, sometimes turned out to harbor another</p>
        <p>motive or carry a secret message.</p>
        <p>In the 1860's, the Bisson brothers scaled the Alps to take pictures that in fact celebrated the acquisition of the territory by the Kingdom of Sardinia. When William Henry Jackson photographed on his second government survey in Colorado between 1873 and 1878, it was already difficult to make pictures of unspoiled wilderness because of the influx of tourists and the evidence of development. But he continued to show the landscape as the frontier that people still supposed it was. Much later, at the end of the 1930's, Ansel Adams used his photographs of the majestic sights of Kings Canyon to lobby Congress for a national park.</p>
        <p>Around 1970, the simultaneous growth of industrialization, suburban sprawl and the environmental movement prompted a reaction among photographers. (Possibly this came earlier in Japan because of the atom bomb; not enough is yet known here about the history of postwar Japanese photography.) In America the clearest sign of an altered response to landscape was work labeled "new topographics" by photographers like Robert Adams, Lewis Baltz and Stephen Shore, who looked on the breakdown of nature with a cool and unimpassioned eye. In Europe and America in the 80's, acid rain, nuclear accidents and overdevelopment occasioned an outpouring of explicit lamentations in photographs.</p>
        <p>The Japanese live quite close to their damaged environment. Not only is the atom bomb ever present in memory, but in the 60's and 70's Japan experienced an unprecedented economic and industrial boom that turned portions of its small, precious and graceful countryside into gigantic industrial communities. In some regions the water and air were poisoned. The legendary Japanese efficiency has created the cleanest manufacturing processes at the lowest cost, but still plastics wash up on shore.</p>
        <p>In any country, the record of the environmental crisis is a tricky enterprise; all too often, a kind of cancerous beauty overshadows its moral message. The viewer ends up enjoying, uncomfortably, what presumably should be condemned and feared. Many photographers, like Tomatsu, calculate the esthetic potential of trash and frame it, glorify it or enshrine it, glossing over a bitter statement with a pleasant poem.</p>
        <p>As for the hints of a dark symbolic meaning in Tomatsu's cherry blossom photographs, there are by now many instances of landscape photographs that allude to the past, or to politics or even to mortality. Still, it is tempting to recall that the landscape as metaphor has a long and honorable tradition in Japan. Zen rock gardens, for instance, are designed to resemble rocks or boats or waterfalls in rivers; to one who comes to meditate in the garden, the river may suggest the river of life and the landscape the setting for the journey of the soul.</p>
        <p>Gardens were art in Japan but photography was not, at least until recently. No museum had a department of photography, nor was any museum devoted to photography, before the late 80's. In America, although there were two important shows of Japanese work in the 70's, that country's output was neglected until a sudden spurt of interest in the last year or so. It is a nice touch that photography brings the Met its first show of a living Japanese artist.</p>
        <p>In fact, the Met has two contemporary photography shows up at one time, another first. (Curiously, the other show, Leo Rubinfien's "Map of the East," is also about Asia.) Wait, there's more: at this moment the museum actually has three photography shows, a first among firsts, for it has just opened its first permanent gallery for prints, drawings and photographs, and put about 30 classics, from Steichen to Arbus, on exhibit.</p>
        <p>"Sakura + Plastics" (on view through January) and the surrounding shows are a visible index of photography's new standing at the Met. The museum, which never even owned any photographs until Stieglitz donated some in 1928, only acknowledged its collection in the early 70's by renaming the department of prints the department of prints and photography. Earlier this year, a separate department of photography was established -- the Modern's was founded in 1940 -- and Maria Morris Hambourg, an associate curator since 1985, was named the first curator of photography. It is a good sign for the medium and the museum that contemporary Japanese and American photography stand almost side by side with the classics at the Met.</p>
