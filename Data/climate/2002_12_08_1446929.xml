        <p>THIS summer, Americans were moved by the bravery of nine men trapped in a watery coal mine and the rescuers who finally freed them. Their ordeal was a fresh reminder of the price that some people pay for our collective dependence on coal.</p>
        <p>A new book, ''Coal: A Human History'' (Perseus Publishing; $25), due in stores next month, aims to further raise awareness of this dependence.</p>
        <p>The book looks at how coal transformed England and then the United States into an industrial superpower and how coal is reshaping developing giants like China.</p>
        <p>''The industrial age emerged literally in a haze of coal smoke,'' writes the author, Barbara Freese, ''and in that smoke we can read much of the history of the modern world.''</p>
        <p>The author has clearly culled many diverse historical sources and is able to draw intriguing links in disparate historical events. For instance, she argues that Henry VIII indirectly assisted England's nascent coal industry in the mid-1500's. After breaking with the Roman Catholic Church over marital problems, he seized coal fields owned by the church and sold them to local merchants, who made the kinds of productivity-enhancing investments that the church had shunned. Newcastle has never been the same.</p>
        <p>But some of her most sweeping conclusions are subject to challenge. For instance, trying to imagine a world without coal, she asserts that ''The Manifesto of the Communist Party,'' the 1848 document partly inspired by the plight of Manchester's working class, ''would never have been written.'' She also conjectures that the North might have lost the Civil War, and that both World Wars might have been averted ''without the industrial rise of coal-rich Germany.''</p>
        <p>''In short,'' she writes, ''none of the defining and epic struggles of the 19th and 20th centuries would have played out as they did.''</p>
        <p>What results is a somewhat inflated view of coal's influence, good and bad, on civilization as we know it.</p>
        <p>This is Ms. Freese's first book, and she does her best to enliven a protagonist that literally sits there like a lump. We learn that the Chinese had to convince local residents that coal mines would not disturb the area's feng shui. We learn how British miners tried illuminating the tunnels with phosphorous fish, a short-lived experiment. And we learn how the 300 citizens of Arcola, Ill., handled a coal shortage in 1902 by ''politely mugging'' a coal train. A bank president who participated in the raid, she writes, ''kept a careful accounting of the amount taken by each person so that payment could later be made.''</p>
        <p>Readers might be just as curious to know more about why the author interrupted a legal career to take up the pen. She mentions that she was an assistant attorney general in Minnesota who helped regulate coal-burning industries. Her opponents at one point advanced the novel argument that global warming might not be bad for a cold state like Minnesota, she recalls.</p>
        <p>After that experience, she writes, ''I was left not only deeply concerned about the changing climate but thoroughly intrigued by the lump of carbon at the center of the storm.''</p>
        <p>So is this book a bit of unfinished business, a dire warning on global warming? Or a simple scholarly treatise?</p>
        <p>It appears to be a bit of both. Critical enough to merit applause that may come from environmentalists, and scholarly enough to make you feel that you deserve college credit for reading it.</p>
        <p>If Ms. Freese is a critic of coal, she also seems to be an admirer. ''Coal was no mere fuel, and no mere article of commerce,'' she writes. ''It represented humanity's triumph over nature -- the foundation of civilization itself.''</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, she writes, ''If coal were not so plentiful, one could imagine it lovingly displayed in museums, placed next to the (generally much younger) dinosaur bones rather than being burned by the trainload.''</p>
        <p>Readers may chuckle at the book's recounting of how societies that embraced coal dealt with issues that still vex us. For instance, Ms. Freese documents how British rulers as far back as 1285 were just as quick as politicians today to create commissions to study, rather than eliminate, coal emissions.</p>
        <p>When English nobles visiting London in 1306 complained about the ''obnoxious odor'' after blacksmiths and other artisans had switched from wood to coal, King Edward I banned its use, the author writes. First offenders faced fines and second offenders ''were to have their furnaces smashed.''</p>
        <p>As it turned out, she writes, neither studies nor sanctions proved as effective as bubonic plague in 1347, which ravaged Europe's population for more than a century.</p>
        <p>That set back coal dealers and allowed forests to replenish. But over time, coal's ability to deliver a reliable fire at an affordable price was unstoppable. And once chimneys became a fixture in the English home by the early 1600's, home use soared and air quality deteriorated.</p>
        <p>By the 1700's, she writes, Britain was probably mining five times more coal than the rest of the world combined, and Londoners ''took to carrying defensive black umbrellas'' to protect themselves against the soot that soiled their clothes whenever it rained.</p>
        <p>Of course, the people who extracted the coal paid a bigger price. Mine explosions became so common, she writes, that mine owners appealed to newspapers to refrain from covering them, and she offers evidence that newspapers like The Newcastle Journal complied.</p>
        <p>On this side of the Atlantic, coal was slower to take hold. Blessed with lush forests that supplied huge amounts of firewood, Americans had less incentive to search for coal. But eventually, of course, they, too, harnessed coal's economic powers and reaped huge benefits from two inventions originally developed for the coal industry. The first was the steam engine, which revolutionized factories all over the United States. The second was the locomotive, which was soon hauling people and goods coast to coast.</p>
        <p>By the late 1890's, the United States overtook Britain as the largest coal producer and inherited some of Britain's labor problems along with the title.</p>
        <p>Ms. Freese relates the story of Franklin B. Gowen, a larger-than-life Pennsylvania industrialist, who relished crushing any attempt by the miners to unionize. In 1875, he had suspected sympathizers rounded up by the Coal and Iron Police, a private security force he controlled that was ''the main law enforcement agency in the region,'' according to the book. He personally led the prosecution of five suspects and supported the prosecution of 20 others who were hanged.</p>
        <p>MS. FREESE does a first-rate job mining history texts for just such nuggets. But the book would have benefited greatly from more contemporary stories, as well -- interviews say, with some of the people who still make their living in the coal mines of Pennsylvania and from representatives of the forces arrayed against them.</p>
        <p>The closest she comes to bringing us voices from the present are the tales she includes about visiting her local power plant and bicycling across Beijing, where coal pollution left her lungs ''stinging for hours.''</p>
        <p>While the author may feel that she has made her case that coal extracts an intolerably high price, she glosses over what kind of future we might expect from alternatives like oil, especially in a world where so much oil is controlled by countries that don't share our interests. It is not until four-fifths through the book that she identifies one big plus in coal's favor by noting that it is ''a reliable source of domestic energy.''</p>
        <p>Surely, with the nation on the brink of war, that issue has to be part of the debate.</p>
