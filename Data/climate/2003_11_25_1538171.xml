        <p>Struggling to break out of a cramped second tier of Democratic presidential candidates in New Hampshire, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman was set to broadcast a new commercial today that sought to appeal to the state's independent voters by casting him as the next John McCain.</p>
        <p>Senator McCain, the maverick Arizona senator who defeated George W. Bush in the Republican primary in New Hampshire in 2000, still has a wellspring of support in the crucial first-primary state that Mr. Lieberman of Connecticut has been working to tap.</p>
        <p>The 30-second advertisement, which is running statewide, features several former McCain supporters who say they now back Mr. Lieberman. ''Something's happening,'' says an announcer, ''McCain supporters are backing Joe Lieberman.''</p>
        <p>The announcer's voice is intercut with some of those supporters saying things like ''an ethical leader'' and ''they're both straight-talking.''</p>
        <p>In New Hampshire, independent voters, who political strategists say make up about a third of the electorate, can cast their ballots in either the Democratic or Republican primary and represent a critical swing bloc.</p>
        <p>Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont who is far ahead in the polls in New Hampshire, is billing himself as an insurgent, as Mr. McCain once did.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman's aides acknowledge that Dr. Dean is running ahead of their candidate among independents in the state. But Mr. Lieberman is explicitly going after those who voted for Mr. McCain.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman has suggested Mr. McCain for secretary of defense. Mr. Lieberman recently sponsored legislation with Mr. McCain to combat global warming. And rarely does a day go by on the stump that Mr. Lieberman does not mention his ''good friend'' Mr. McCain.</p>
        <p>A few of Mr. McCain's supporters from New Hampshire first approached Mr. Lieberman's campaign on their own, a Lieberman aide said, but now the campaign is making a concerted effort to bring them into the fold.</p>
        <p>About 40 former McCain supporters, including several who served as town chairmen for his campaign, have pledged fealty to Mr. Lieberman, and the campaign is sending out 30,000 letters, signed by a group of the town chairmen, seeking even more McCain supporters.</p>
        <p>''I think he's smart to be courting a McCain group like he is, trying to build a McCain organization,'' said Michael Dennehy, who was Mr. McCain's New Hampshire campaign manager and is now backing President Bush. ''I don't see any other candidate really doing that.''</p>
        <p>The new commercial is the second in which Mr. Lieberman ties himself to Mr. McCain. It uses a series of voters to portray Mr. Lieberman as someone who is not bound by party ideology and who has fought special interests. Mandy Grunwald, a media adviser to the Lieberman campaign, said the new advertising buy would be ''substantial'' but declined to specify how much the campaign was spending.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain, who does not appear in the commercial, was tied up in the Senate and a spokeswoman said she would not comment.</p>
