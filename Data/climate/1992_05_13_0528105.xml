        <p>He has been president and chief operating officer of the utility and will retain the title of president. As chief executive he succeeds John W. Ellis, who remains chairman.

        <p>Richard R. Sonstelie takes the helm this week as chief executive of the fast-growing Puget Sound Power and Light Company, which has entered the 1990's on solid financial footing after some turbulent years of involvement in nuclear plants.</p>
        <p>He has been president and chief operating officer of the utility and will retain the title of president. As chief executive he succeeds John W. Ellis, who remains chairman. Mr. Ellis is also a principal partner in the Baseball Club of Seattle, a group of investors, including executives from Nintendo of America Inc., who are attempting to buy the Mariners team.</p>
        <p>Puget Power, based in Bellevue, Wash., has been struggling for years to find reliable sources of power for its customers, who now number 1.7 million. The number is growing 3 percent a year, twice the national average for electric utilities. Nuclear Plants Abandoned</p>
        <p>When Mr. Sonstelie, now 47 years old, joined the utility in 1974, regional energy planners were warning that the Pacific Northwest faced power shortages. As a result, the utility invested in five nuclear power plants. All were eventually scrapped. But millions of dollars had gone into the plants, and shareholder values were wrecked from the write-offs.</p>
        <p>"Those were very combative times for us," Mr. Sonstelie said. "Our annual meeting today was very peaceful. A dozen years ago, rate payer advocates would buy one share just so they could come to annual meetings and confront us.</p>
        <p>"But we've changed, too. We now try to get input from citizens before we make a major decision, rather than announce what we intend to do and in return have them fight us. This cooperation has helped us turn the corner on relationships with customers. A decade ago there wasn't even a glimmer of this."</p>
        <p>Today, the utility has recovered financially and reports nearly $1 billion in revenue and $2 billion in assets. Shareholder equity rose 7 percent in 1991, and per-share earnings by 2.3 percent.  Emphasis on Conservation</p>
        <p>In the next decade, Mr. Sonstelie said, the company will rely on conservation, and on small-scale hydroelectric units and other renewable energy resources. He said it would also buy the output of plants built by independent power producers.</p>
        <p>He became interested in nuclear energy while at the United States Military Academy because the Army was interested in building a nuclear power program. After he graduated in 1966, the Army sent him to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he earned a master's degree in nuclear engineering. He then went to Vietnam with the Army Corps of Engineers and he served as a combat commander. He later received a master's degree from the Harvard Business School.</p>
        <p>He began his civilian career in the early 1970's as a project manager at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratories in New Mexico. He joined Puget Power in 1974 as an engineer and by 1980 headed engineering and operations. He was named executive vice president in 1985, president in 1987 and chief operating officer in 1991.</p>
