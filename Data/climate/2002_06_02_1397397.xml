        <p>I figure that my friend the fly-tier, whose creations are so perfect it seems a shame to fish with them, knows everything about trout flies.

        <p>Was it a reflection of some natural process? Were insects evolving into ever tinier creatures? Or was it perhaps a vast poly-wing conspiracy, the sole purpose of which was to make me and other devotees of the size 12 Adams feel awkward and blind?</p>

        <p>I figure that my friend the fly-tier, whose creations are so perfect it seems a shame to fish with them, knows everything about trout flies. So I asked him why the artificials that he and others create were so small now, when once they were clearly visible even to anglers of a certain age.</p>
        <p>Was it a reflection of some natural process? Were insects evolving into ever tinier creatures? Or was it perhaps a vast poly-wing conspiracy, the sole purpose of which was to make me and other devotees of the size 12 Adams feel awkward and blind?</p>
        <p>We agreed on the last, most dismal and pessimistic choice, as we usually do when we talk about anything. This is partly my fault, but not entirely. My friend is, after all, the person who invented this twisted aphorism:</p>
        <p>''I felt sorry for myself because I had no shoes, until I met a man who had no feet. Lucky son of a gun didn't even need shoes.'' Or waders, for that matter.</p>
        <p>Still, it is hard to imagine that the creation of small artificial flies could be entirely innocent. I talked recently to another friend who claimed to have caught fish on a size 32 something-or-other (if you cannot see a fly, how can you give it a name?), which, as he explained it, requires a single strand of DNA as tippet material. I see the workings of a criminal mastermind somewhere.</p>
        <p>To track down the official reason for the current crisis in small flies I delved into my friend's vast fishing library. Actually, it is a fly-tying library. There are only a couple of books on what to do with the flies once you have made them.</p>
        <p>First, we checked the classic, Ray Bergman's ''Trout,'' a wonderful book filled with talk of size 10 and 12 flies. (As with almost everything in fly-fishing, the categorization of artificials is counterintuitive -- the higher the number, the smaller the fly.)</p>
        <p>Bergman had this to say about small flies in 1952 in the book's second edition published by Alfred A. Knopf: ''The real need for the small flies is when midges are on the water, and the smaller your 16's and 18's are tied, the more chance there is that they will be effective.''</p>
        <p>The smallest fly I could find any reference to in Bergman's book was a size 20.</p>
        <p>So, memory had served me well, after all. In the old days, when winters were cold and the snow was deep, graphite was in pencils, and sensible people turned to hunting and drinking when the weather got cold, artificial flies were indeed bigger.</p>
        <p>So what happened? I turned to ''Micropatterns,'' by Darrel Martin (Lyons Press, 1999), all about small flies. ''Each year, the fly seems to shrink,'' he wrote. Don't I know it.</p>
        <p>The reasons, as with everything else that has gone wrong with modern life are numerous. Technology has evolved, providing ever thinner tippet material, incredible nanohooks and rods equipped to cast dandelion seeds on spider silk.</p>
        <p>And trout have supposedly become more educated, thus recognizing how sadly inadequate many of the galumphing size 16's are. I happen to believe that many trout, particularly in the more well-known streams, receive an annual stipend from Orvis, in addition to commissions on new equipment purchases in their cantons.</p>
        <p>Here is the point we have now reached. In an article about midges posted on flyanglersonline.com, Ralph D'Andrea, a Colorado fly fisherman, wrote, ''A size 14 or 12 Griffith's gnat looks like a mating cluster of a couple of dozen adult midges.''</p>
        <p>That's about 24 flies, right? In other words, a size 14 fly can now be seen as a kind of artificial chum pot.</p>
        <p>Even midge aficionados have their limits. I called D'Andrea after reading his article to ask him about size 32's. He fishes midges all the time, but he said, ''I don't fish with anything smaller than a 24 because my arms aren't long enough for me to see where to tie the tippet on.''</p>
        <p>I know there are unpleasant realities here that are not funny. In the introduction to Martin's book, another writer and angler, Ted Leeson, points out that there are now 80,000 dams in the United States. The dams obliterate natural habitats, but create tail water, brand new habitat for trout and insects, colonized first by the smallest flies. It is not all the fault of the tackle makers.</p>
        <p>And there is an alternative. There has been an equal and opposite reaction to the miniaturization of fly-fishing. I am talking about the increased popularity of big tackle for big saltwater fish, weight 17 rods and flies the size of the trout you catch on those one-weight outfits. (Actually, they are the size of all the trout I catch.)</p>
        <p>It is not only stripers and tarpon. Fly fishers are catching marlin and other blue water fish. I just read some tips the other day on casting into the (real) chum stream behind a deep-water boat. Another idea was to flick a fly (or a rib roast) into the water just as another angler is pulling his tuna into the boat.</p>
        <p>This is supposed to be because the big fish offer a terrific fight, great sport, furious thrills. I think it is simply because a lot of us in the bifocal crowd have given up and are willing to fish for anything, as long as we can leave the magnifying glass at home. I feel a novel on this subject coming on. I think I will call it ''The Old Man and the Fly He Can Actually See.''</p>
        <p>The real reason all this has happened is that as long as there is money to pay for it, technology evolves on its own, filling all niches. Since many fly fishers have the kind of tackle-buying habits that call for a new 12-step program (my name is Bill, and I own 37 fly rods), the money is there.</p>
        <p>I suppose this is a good thing, because it keeps the engineers busy, but I had a frightening thought.</p>
        <p>If advances in microfishing continue, there may be a whole new world of creatures to imitate. Nematodes, water bears, paramecium -- given global warming and the population explosion there may well be a future in the puddle and pond scum fisheries.</p>
        <p>Time to get out the vise, and the microscope.</p>
