        <p>LEAD: In an unexpectedly strong move, the 12 European Community countries agreed today to eliminate by the end of the century their production and use of chemicals that harm the atmosphere's ozone shield.</p>
        <p>In an unexpectedly strong move, the 12 European Community countries agreed today to eliminate by the end of the century their production and use of chemicals that harm the atmosphere's ozone shield.</p>
        <p>In Washington, officials of the Bush Administration said tonight that William K. Reilly, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, would strongly urge President Bush to endorse a worldwide phaseout of the chemicals by the century's end.</p>
        <p>The action by the 12 European nations was announced in Brussels and was described in London by the Secretary of State for the Environment, Nicholas Ridley, who said he was delighted. Mr. Reilly also hailed the development as ''very encouraging news for the world's environment.'' Early Cut in Production</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the European Community said the environmental ministers from the 12 countries had also agreed to cut production of the chemicals by 85 percent as soon as possible, Reuters reported from Brussels.</p>
        <p>The agreement applies to certain chlorofluorocarbons, which are widely used as coolants in refrigerators and air-conditioners, as propellants in aerosol spray cans, in foam insulation and as solvents. The chemicals eventually rise into the stratosphere, where ultraviolet radiation breaks them up, releasing chlorine or bromine atoms that can destroy the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>Ozone in the stratosphere protects the earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. Any increase in that radiation resulting from a thinning of the ozone will cause skin cancer and other harm to humans and damage crops, forests and other natural systems, scientists say. Alarm Has Increased</p>
        <p>Mounting scientific evidence that chlorofluorocarbons have substantially thinned the ozone layer over Antarctica in recent winters, and are present in dangerous concentrations over the Arctic as well, has caused increasing alarm.</p>
        <p>The European action goes beyond an agreement reached in Montreal in 1987 calling for a 50 percent reduction in the production of chlorofluorocarbons by the end of the century. Thirty-one nations, including the Common Market countries and the United States, have ratified that agreement, which took effect last December.</p>
        <p>Each of the 12 European nations would have to pass legislation to ban production or insure that industry did so voluntarily. The agreement in Brussels committed the nations to do that. Third of World Production</p>
        <p>The World Resources Institute, an environmental group in the United States, estimated that the Common Market nations produced 35 to 37 percent of the world's chlorofluorocarbons. The United States produces 30 to 34 percent, the group said.</p>
        <p>''It's a global problem,'' said the French Environment Minister, Brice Lalonde. ''It's important to get the rest of the world behind us.''</p>
        <p>British officials will be hosts for a 112-nation conference on saving the ozone layer that opens here Sunday. Mr. Ridley, who said on Wednesday that Britain hoped to get the conference to agree to an 85 percent reduction in emissions of the chemicals from 1986 levels by 1999, said today that he hoped that the conference would convince many more countries to follow the European Community's lead.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ridley said the British government sent out invitations to the conference last fall after concluding that the Montreal agreement was not enough to stop the damage to the environment.</p>
        <p>Last September, Lee M. Thomas, then the head of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, called for the elimination of chlorofluorocarbons and other chemicals implicated in the destruction of the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly, who succeeded Mr. Thomas, cautioned that care was needed in finding substitutes for the chlorofluorocarbon compounds the European community has pledged to ban.</p>
        <p>''We need to be sure,'' he said, ''that any C.F.C. substitutes that might be developed do not pose new and unforeseen environmental risks, such as exacerbating global warming.'' Substitutes Are More Costly</p>
        <p>Elimination of chlorofluorocarbons is technically feasible but none of the current substitutes work as well, and most are more costly.</p>
        <p>The Bush Administration's domestic policy council met today to consider the Unites States position at the London meeting. It decided to offer the President options, including calling for a complete phaseout by the end of the century, but did not make a specific recommendation.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, whose critics often attack her for being more concerned about private industry than about the environment, said in an interview on British television broadcast tonight that she had been responsible for keeping up financing of British scientific research in the Antarctic. Eventually British refrigerators would be required to contain no offending solvents, she said.</p>
        <p>She began to attract attention to her pro-environmental policies in September with a speech at the Royal Society's annual dinner, when she expressed alarm about ''a large hole in the ozone layer,'' acid rain and the 'greenhouse effect,'' the gradual warming of the earth's atmosphere brought about by industrial activity.</p>
        <p>An aide said Mrs. Thatcher, who studied chemistry at Oxford University, had become persuaded that more action was needed after a report by the British stratospheric ozone review group later last fall. It reported that the amount of chlorine in the stratosphere would double over the next 50 years even if the nations that have ratified the Montreal agreement on a 50 percent cut fully lived up to it. Caution From Greenpeace</p>
        <p>The environmental group Greenpeace said Wednesday that even if all countries stopped producing chlorofluorocarbons by next year, chlorine levels in the atmosphere would not get back to 1985 levels until 2050. Greenpeace also said the United Kingdom was the largest producer and exporter of chlorofluorocarbons in Western Europe.</p>
        <p>The British Government is taking the line that the industrialized countries alone cannot halt the danger, because China and other developing countries also produce and use the dangerous chemicals. Mr. Ridley said today that Britain would eliminate all chlorofluorocarbons from aerosol cans by the end of this year and was closer to finding substitutes in refrigeration than other countries were.</p>
        <p>''There is still a great demand,'' Mr. Ridley said. ''The Chinese are coming to the conference, but they are increasing their production by 20 percent a year. It is simply not true that this is a matter of the industrial countries doing all the polluting.''</p>
