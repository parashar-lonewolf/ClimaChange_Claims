        <p>When Gov. C. L. Otter took office last month and immediately halted construction work on the state Capitol his objections went beyond the $130 million price tag for the renovation and addition.</p>
        <p>''My concern is also about the expansion of government,'' said Mr. Otter, a Republican. ''When you have more space, bureaucracy doesn't like an empty office. It creates a vacuum. It sucks people into it, and all of a sudden you've got to have more people.''</p>
        <p>The governor has since reached a deal with the Republican-controlled Legislature to cut the project in half, allowing construction to go forward, although not until the new individual offices for legislators are removed from the blueprints.</p>
        <p>Yet if Mr. Otter won this round, he might well savor the moment because Idaho's government is growing whether or not government buildings grow with it.</p>
        <p>In a conservative state that has long viewed government with suspicion, that still means conflict. But even the governor's fellow Republicans concede that the momentum here shifted years ago from bait-and-bullet to New West boutique. As with so many other decreasingly rugged places in the inland West, there is more of everybody in Idaho now: techies, Democrats, immigrants, environmentalists. Ten thousand people showed up at Boise State University last month to hear Al Gore talk about global warming. Ten thousand people. To hear Al Gore. In Idaho.</p>
        <p>The state's population, almost 1.5 million, is up nearly 50 percent since 1990 and some projections show it gaining another 50 percent or more by 2020.</p>
        <p>While the growth has brought a sophisticated new economy, it has also brought demands for more spending on education and transportation and concerns about high taxes, too much development and a trampled environment.</p>
        <p>And a ton more government.</p>
        <p>In 1991, the state budget was $900 million. This year it is $2.6 billion. In 1985, there were 11,876 state employees. In 2005, there were 17,528.</p>
        <p>In 1985, the number of pages of legislation passed was 759. Last year it was 1,581.</p>
        <p>The public spaces where many of the issues are aired, however, are the same small hearing rooms, some with a single row of chairs for the public, where part-time lawmakers and a few interested stakeholders once wrangled largely over matters of mining, farming and logging.</p>
        <p>Now, although the Legislature is still part-time, people squeeze into the back of hearing rooms, huddle in doorways or crowd around speakers that broadcast committee discussions out into the rotunda. (The volume dial on the speaker outside one hearing room was turned all the way up to 10 this week.)</p>
        <p>''It was designed to not have very much public participation in the process,'' Speaker of the House Lawerence E. Denney said of the Capitol.</p>
        <p>While there now are more citizens who follow the Legislature, more people are paid to participate as well. About 75 lobbyists were members of the Idaho Legislative Advisors when Jan Eyth first started serving coffee and snacks in the group's tiny lounge on the Capitol's fourth floor in 1985. Now, Ms. Eyth said, there are more than 150 members, and there are more than 300 registered lobbyists in the state.</p>
        <p>Still, some say, interpret this change carefully.</p>
        <p>''You know what lobbyists are?'' said Russell Westerberg, a lobbyist from Soda Springs who came to Boise as a state representative in 1975. ''They're the people that the people have to pay to protect them from the people that they elected.'' He added, ''It's still Idaho; the government that governs least, governs best.''</p>
        <p>The Capitol, in which a light-filled rotunda is lined with bright marble, once housed the Legislature, the governor's office, the Supreme Court and even a mineral laboratory. Now, the state spends $13 million a year renting about 900,000 square feet of private office space.</p>
        <p>All of that prevailed upon Mr. Otter, to a degree. Under the compromise with the Legislature, which had approved the expansion a year ago, new underground wings will be reduced in size and many new offices will be cut. Larger hearing rooms will be built, however, and renovations at the Capitol will go forward.</p>
        <p>Still, neither side claims to be happy with the deal, and no one is certain whether much money will be saved. The commission overseeing the project has asked to see a revised budget before moving forward. That could take weeks.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, lawmakers will move out of the Capitol in April. The Legislature, which had planned to hold its 2008 and 2009 sessions in temporary quarters in two aging buildings nearby, now will probably be displaced through the 2010 session because of the delays in construction.The governor, who under the compromise agreed to move some of his staff out of the Capitol, says the state should renovate the buildings and use them permanently. Mr. Otter, a former three-term congressman, said in his campaign for governor last fall that he would ''run government the old-fashioned way, lean and smart.'' In an interview in his office on Friday, he popped up from his chair to retrieve photographs of a schoolyard cluttered with temporary classrooms. Then he showed a picture of the state Capitol in Texas, whose underground expansion wings were a model for the Idaho plan.</p>
        <p>''This is where they want kids to spend nine months,'' Mr. Otter said. ''This is where they want to spend three months.''</p>
        <p>Senator Robert L. Geddes, who is the president pro tem and one of the leaders of the expansion project, conceded that legislators could only put up so much of a fight, even in a changing state.</p>
        <p>''The vision of a grandiose Taj Mahal being built for the comfort of me,'' Mr. Geddes said, ''that doesn't sit real well in my conservative district.''</p>
