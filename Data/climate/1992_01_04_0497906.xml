        <p>It looks like a mineral water, tastes like a soft drink and sells for $1 a bottle. It is Clearly Canadian and it is the beverage industry's fastest-rising star.</p>
        <p>Some industry analysts say Clearly Canadian is the new leader of what they call the "new age" category of light beverages like flavored seltzers and fruit juice-based soft drinks. Unsweetened mineral waters, like Perrier, are not included in the category.</p>
        <p>But others say the fruit-flavored soda from Vancouver, British Columbia, has defined a new, higher-priced category of soft drink, much like premium beers and wines. In this category, marketing focuses on the beverages' distinct taste, elegant packaging and the imported cachet to command a consistently high price for a few cents' worth of ingredients.  No. 1 Ranking Expected</p>
        <p>Clearly Canadian is now sold throughout the United States and Canada, with some distribution in Japan, Britain and Ireland. In three years, it "has gone from practically nothing to a major force in the category," said Hellen Berry, vice president for marketing at the Beverage Marketing Corporation, a consulting firm based in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>With sales of 21 million cases expected for 1991, Clearly Canadian will surge past Sundance and Original New York Seltzer to grab the lead spot in its category, she said.</p>
        <p>"In 38 years in the business, I've never ever experienced anything like it," said Joseph Tighe, president of the Chatham Beverages Company, Clearly Canadian's master distributor for the East Coast. "It just flies off the shelves." He expects his sales of Clearly Canadian to double this year.</p>
        <p>The Clearly Canadian Beverage Corporation, which trades shares on the Vancouver exchange and on Nasdaq, reported sales for the 1991 fiscal year, ended June 30, of $61.2 million (United States), more than three times the 1990 figure of $17.4 million. Some analysts expect it to leap to nearly $200 million for the 1992 fiscal year. That assumption is reflected in Clearly's share price, which soared from $2.88 to $26.25 this year before dropping back a bit; it closed yesterday at $17.50, up $2.25.</p>
        <p>But other analysts question whether Clearly can continue its growth rate, noting that other "new age" beverages have had spectacular rises and falls in recent years. They say growth may flatten when the company runs out of new markets to expand to, and profit margins could shrink from the expense of increased advertising necessary to maintain a mature product.</p>
        <p>Clearly Canadian comes in six fruit flavors indigenous to Canada, with names like mountain blackberry, orchard peach and coastal cranberry. The package, a clear blue-tinted bottle with painted-on type and colorful renderings of fruit, is "beautiful, the kind college students collect the way they used to collect the little green Perrier bottle," Ms. Berry said.  The Taste Says Soda Pop</p>
        <p>But while Clearly Canadian's packaging -- and typical store placement -- says mineral water, the taste says soda pop, with a big load of fructose sweetness. This dichotomy has been Clearly Canadian's strength so far, but could ultimately be a weakness, said Tom Pirko, president of Bevmark Inc., a Los Angeles-based consulting firm for the beverage industry.</p>
        <p>"Clearly is the first product that works on the basis of mimicry," Mr. Pirko said. "It gets people to make a purchase and convinces them they made a good purchase even though they made it for the wrong reason. People buy it as a mineral water and it's a soft drink."</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, he said, the question is, "Will the consumer continue to believe in the mimicry?"</p>
        <p>Clearly Canadian's management said that neither they nor consumers had doubts about the product's identity. "It's not Perrier," Douglas L. Mason, Clearly's president and chief executive, said in a telephone interview. "It's not mineral water. It's a light soft drink." Change in Labeling</p>
        <p>But he said the whole premium category was still evolving. Clearly Canadian's labeling reflects that evolution, as well as anticipation of tighter regulation of product packaging by the Food and Drug Administration. Originally labeled "sparkling mineral water," the bottle now says "sparkling water beverage." Besides fructose, the product contains sodium benzoate, a preservative. Still, the word "natural" appears twice on the front of most of the labels.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mason said the use of Canadian well water maintained a positive health image without any reference to mineral content.</p>
        <p>Clearly Canadian ships that water to its master distributors in special container trucks. The distributors combine the water with syrup and carbon dioxide (to give it fizz) and bottle the product. The process is much more expensive than that used for most soft drinks, which are made with local tap water, but Mr. Mason said it was important to the product's identity.</p>
        <p>"We want to be an imported product, and to continue to be a Canadian product we have to have that content," he said. Trucking Canadian water to the United States is also "a big barrier to competitive entry, because they all think we're lunatics," he added.  Four Tiers of Distribution</p>
        <p>Other soft-drink bottlers might also question Clearly Canadian's complex distribution strategy. Major soft-drink bottlers do their own distribution to retailers in what is essentially a two-tiered system. Beer, wine and hard liquor typically go through a three-tiered system, from manufacturer to wholesaler to retailer. Clearly Canadian goes from the company to its master distributors to wholesalers to retailers -- four tiers of distribution.</p>
        <p>"Everybody has their position secured," said Jean-Michel Valette, a principal with Hambrecht &amp; Quist who specializes in the beverage industry. "Each link takes a margin."</p>
        <p>This structure constricts Clearly Canadian's profit margins and "makes the company vulnerable to the next successful product that doesn't go through this chain," he added. Distributors as Partners</p>
        <p>Mr. Mason said the company's distribution structure was the only way that founders with a limited amount of money could establish Clearly Canadian as a brand.</p>
        <p>"We did it to get a collective strength," he said. "Over $200 million has been spent on this brand over the last few years; we couldn't have afforded it. We don't own any plants or trucks and haven't had to make the huge investment in the marketplace."</p>
        <p>Because all of the master distributors are or have been shareholders in the company, they are more like partners than a typical wholesaler, Mr. Mason said.</p>
        <p>"We think of our master licensees as brand managers," he said, noting that many were longtime distributors of alcoholic beverages looking for a new growth vehicle when they signed on with Clearly Canadian. "The brand is theirs as much as ours," he added.  Request for Arbitration</p>
        <p>Not all of these agreements have gone smoothly. Camfrey Resources Ltd., a Vancouver holding company that purchased Australian and Western European distribution rights to Clearly Canadian in 1988 for $1.4 million plus royalties, said this week that it would seek arbitration with the company.</p>
        <p>Camfrey said it was entitled to distribute Clearly in the United States and that it was owed a royalty of 25 cents (Canadian) for each case of the beverage sold in the United States or Britain</p>
        <p>Clearly Canadian said that it did not dispute the royalty claims but that Camfrey had no right to United States distribution and that its European and Australian distribution rights had been terminated.  Copy-Cat Products</p>
        <p>A number of copy-cat products, like Mystic Mountain in the United States and Natura from Iceland, have had little impact on Clearly Canadian. But the brand still faces substantial competition from established products like Sundance and Koala Springs. And more heavyweight competition could be on the way: Pepsi has been test-marketing a flavored water product called H2 OH!, and has announced plans to produce a clear cola.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mason, who has pursued and abandoned previous businesses selling hot tubs, home beer-making kits and Jolt Cola -- infamous for its "all the sugar, twice the caffeine" pitch -- is confident this one is for the long haul. In California, where the brand made its debut three years ago, Clearly Canadian will begin its first advertising campaign this year, spending $12 million over the next 12 months on radio, print and billboards.</p>
        <p>"Our whole mandate is to replace any other beverage the human body may be consuming," Mr. Mason said. "Milk is as much a competitor as Coca-Cola."</p>
