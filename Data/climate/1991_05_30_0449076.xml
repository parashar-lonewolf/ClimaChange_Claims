        <p>The Magellan space probe has completed its first survey of Venus, producing even more detailed images of a surface composed of 'igantic lava flows, thousands of cracks and craters and numerous features indicating the forces of fierce volcanic activity, scientists said today.</p>

        <p>The Magellan space probe has completed its first survey of Venus, producing even more detailed images of a surface composed of 'igantic lava flows, thousands of cracks and craters and numerous features indicating the forces of fierce volcanic activity, scientists said today.</p>
        <p>"For the first time, we have a global map of the planet with enough detail and resolution to help us understand the processes that have shaped Venus," Dr. Stephen Saunders, the chief project scientist, said at a news conference here. "Venus may be giving us a look into our past -- not the present-day Earth, but when the Earth was very young."</p>
        <p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has already released earlier images made by the Magellan probe, but the pictures made public today offer an unusually detailed view of the planet's surface. Seen From a New Perspective</p>
        <p>After completing one Venus-year, or 243 days, of observations in which 84 percent of the surface was mapped from orbit, the robot craft has shifted into a slightly different orbit to scan the cloud-covered surface from a new perspective that should amplify the earlier findings, NASA officials said.</p>
        <p>Ninety-five percent of Venus's surface will have been mapped by the end of the spacecraft's second 243-day cycle, Dr. Saunders said.</p>
        <p>The Magellan has a powerful radar system that penetrates the planet's clouds of carbon dioxide and its atmosphere, which is 90 times denser than Earth's. Pictures constructed from the spacecraft's data show features as small as a football field, scientists said.</p>
        <p>"Magellan has removed the veil from planet Venus," said Dr. Wesley T. Huntress, head of NASA's solar system exploration division. Likening Venus to the biblical temptress Salome, Dr. Huntress said: "If Venus had seven veils, previous attempts had removed two of them. Magellan has laid Venus bare."</p>
        <p>A new series of still pictures released by the space agency, as well as a computer-simulated video of a mythical high-speed flight over the surface of Venus, show a planet of long rift valleys, huge craters and uplifts, and cracked and splintered crust showing the strains of volcanic activity.</p>
        <p>One of the surprise findings, Dr. Saunders said, is that no feature on the planet appears more than one billion years old and that the average age of the surface seems to be about 400 million years. This surface change appears to be the result of enormous lava flows and magma upheavals that virtually repave the planet every few hundred million years, he said.</p>
        <p>The face of Venus is not eroded by winds, which blow at two to four miles an hour near the surface, Dr. Saunders said. Because of this lack of erosion, he added, scientists have had trouble dating the more than 600 large craters spotted on the planet.</p>
        <p>"Everything looks so fresh we haven't been able to figure out which are the youngest craters," he said.</p>
        <p>The 7,410-pound spacecraft, launched in May 1989, went into an orbit of Venus last August and began its first mapping cycle on Sept. 15.</p>
        <p>Mission scientists said they thought they could nurse Magellan along for at least six more cycles around the planet, provided money was available. That should result in complete mapping, detailed elevation data on surface features and studies of the planet's gravity and its fluctuations.</p>
        <p>Dr. Huntress said the spacecraft cost $450 million to build and launch, and about $42 million a year to operate.</p>
        <p>Although the mission is financed only through 1992, he said, NASA will find money for it as long as the spacecraft is sending back interesting data.</p>
