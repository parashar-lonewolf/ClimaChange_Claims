        <p>The Michael Jordan who exited from the playoffs in the second round this past week was clearly not the Michael Jordan we once knew, the money player who not only took the big shot but so often rattled it in.</p>
        <p>Old Mike would pick you clean at half court. New Mike cheats back and tries to swat the ball away from behind.</p>
        <p>Old Mike had an idea of his purpose before he took flight. New Mike waits until you can slide a credit card under his sneakers before making up his mind.</p>
        <p>But New Mike should be liked for a couple of reasons: He has only played 27 games in two years and will not collect Social Security for another 34, which means he may have some basketball left in him.</p>
        <p>And, also, New Mike is more of a regular guy and not the deity we so want him to be. He commits turnovers in the clutch, he loses games and -- this is important -- God no longer has an identity crisis.</p>
        <p>The truth about Jordan's comeback: We needed him -- the National Basketball Association, Midwest pork farmers, jaded sports columnists and every child with a life-size poster of Dennis Rodman on his wall -- more than he needed us.</p>
        <p>He came back as a basketball player. We wanted a celestial being.</p>
        <p>He got what he wanted.</p>
        <p>When we did not, we felt compelled to compare him with Old Mike instead of appreciating the wondrous player New Mike still is and will continue to become.</p>
        <p>Each time Jordan faltered, a new expert was called in to sidle up to the studio host and explain His Airness's demise, as if -- that's it, the ozone layer just disappeared: "Michael is just a jump shooter now. His timing is off. He may not be able to get it back."</p>
        <p>I have no official proof, but I'm positive my waitress at Michael Jordan's restaurant was a step slower this season. She doesn't have the same explosiveness bringing nachos to my table she had in 1993. The History Channel did a nice piece on Sitting Bull, but for real in-depth chronicling, you needed SportsChannel's nightly take on Jordan.</p>
        <p>The greater insanity took over when he left the court.</p>
        <p>There were 15-cameraman pileups, near-fistfights between media members jockeying for position. At least three people hit the ground hard following him to and from practice as reporters hung on his every word. Children cut class to watch him walk 25 yards from a gym to the team bus.</p>
        <p>Select company used to include Larry Bird and Magic Johnson. Suddenly, it was expanded -- to Moses and Gandhi.</p>
        <p>Jordan's security team, numbering more than a half-dozen, whisked him all over during the playoffs. Once after a practice in Charlotte, N.C., a member of the Bulls' public relations staff inquired as to their whereabouts by asking, "Where's Jesus and His Apostles?"</p>
        <p>Note the first sentence of a Florida newspaper article about Jordan's impact before Game 1 of the Orlando series: "Michael Jordan is a lot like God." The Almighty could not be immediately reached for comment, but then, he never had to pass to Luc Longley trailing by 1.</p>
        <p>"When I hear the Second Coming and things of that nature, it bothers me," Jordan said after Game 6, a loss that ended the Bulls' season on Thursday. "I came back to play basketball because I love this game. That's it. I would like to uphold the standards of professionalism and show how much I care about basketball, but I'm not a savior."</p>
        <p>So Michael Miracle can sometimes be Michael Mediocre, too, and considering where the Jordan legend was headed, this is a good thing.</p>
        <p>He is a basketball player who happens to play the game so splendidly and gracefully we cannot let him get off that easily. With other athletes driving their sports cars into trees stone drunk, showing contempt for fans or just seeming not to care, we wanted more from Michael.</p>
        <p>Jordan must shoulder some of the blame, scripting his entire comeback as only Frank Capra could. Jordanmania was capsulized by his number change in Game 2, after he first said he would not wear his original 23 jersey because it was the last number his father saw him play in before his death in 1993. The high point was Jordan leaving No. 45 on the hanger and leading the Bulls to victory over the Magic. The nadir hit soon after, as the fines were levied and memorabilia collectors emptied the shelves of sporting goods stores for those precious and few No. 45s.</p>
        <p>On one hand, watching Jordan carve up Orlando in his old number was transcendental, worthy of at least one bad Superman cliche. But, too, it illustrated the hysteria behind his legend.</p>
        <p>"But Phil, what about all those parents who bought their kids No. 45 jerseys?" someone with a straight face asked Bulls Coach Phil Jackson last week. "What do you tell them after they spent all their money on that?"</p>
        <p>Jackson paused before answering.</p>
        <p>"Buy them books," he said.  ON PRO BASKETBALL</p>
