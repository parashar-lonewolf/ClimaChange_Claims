        <p>Japan's foreign minister, Makiko Tanaka, said today that Tokyo would work ''to the last moment'' to persuade the United States to support the Kyoto Protocol to curb global warming.</p>
        <p>Ms. Tanaka's comments, made on the eve of her first official trip to the United States, were the latest in a drum roll of remarks by senior officials here this week aimed at supporting European efforts to convince Washington to reconsider its opposition to the accords to limit greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, Japan's popular new prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi called the Bush Administration position on the accords ''truly deplorable,'' and also pledged to continue working to persuade Washington to change its position.</p>
        <p>Ms. Tanaka is expected to take up the subject in her first meeting with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell on Monday in Washington, and Mr. Koizumi, who is scheduled to meet with Mr. Bush in their first summit on June 30, has already signaled his intention to follow up on the issue.</p>
        <p>But even as Japan stakes out a position strongly in favor of the 1997 accord, which was named after this country's ancient capital and has inevitably become linked to national pride, Ms. Tanaka has carefully kept Japan's options open with regard to the agreement, saying that ratification ''cannot go ahead with European countries while leaving the United States behind.''</p>
        <p>Japan's calculated ambiguity on the issue, strongly urging the United States to ratify the protocol, while hedging its own commitment in the case Washington refuses, reveals the complex political geometry behind the accord.</p>
        <p>The 1997 protocol requires industrial countries to impose binding limits on emissions of carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases by an average of 5.2 percent below 1990 levels from 2008 to 2012.</p>
        <p>For the protocol to take effect, a collection of countries that emit 55 percent of the world's industrial greenhouse gases would have to ratify it. And with Washington appearing set against the accord, and Europe set firmly in support of it, Japan, with the world's second largest economy, has emerged as the critical pivot.</p>
        <p>If Tokyo adopted the protocol, the presence of Japan and Europe together would ensure ratification. Similarly, if Japan opted out because of the refusal of the United States to ratify it, the protocol would become a dead letter.</p>
        <p>''Japan is key,'' said Svend Auken, Denmark's energy and environment minister, in a statement to the World Bank on Friday, according to Bloomberg News. ''Russia, the Ukraine and the European Union account for about 53 percent. It is the last 2 percent that is difficult.'' While Japan has made common cause with Europe in pressuring Washington to reconsider its opposition to the accord, Tokyo has carefully avoided tilting its hand about what it would do in the end.</p>
        <p>In April, for example, Japan's Parliament strongly approved a resolution calling for ratification of the agreement. Mr. Koizumi faced repeated questions from the Parliament this week urging him to submit the pact to the legislature for its approval. Some members of his cabinet, too, are known to be strongly in favor of ratification.</p>
        <p>Mr. Koizumi, however, has avoided committing himself. ''At the moment, we have not decided to make an independent decision,'' he told the legislature on Thursday.</p>
