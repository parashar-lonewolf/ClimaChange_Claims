        <p>Talking the Talk But Burning Big</p>
        <p>ON the occasion of Earth Day, President Bush and Senator John Kerry boldly declared themselves pro-Earth.

        <p>Talking the Talk But Burning Big</p>
        <p>ON the occasion of Earth Day, President Bush and Senator John Kerry boldly declared themselves pro-Earth. But promoting ecologically correct public policy is not enough to believers in the environmentalist adage, ''Think globally, act locally.'' How green is each candidate in his personal life?</p>
        <p>The presidential candidates preach energy conservation, but they both burn a lot of fossil fuels as they travel among their eight homes (three for Mr. Bush, five for Mr. Kerry and his wife). Air Force One is a Boeing 747 modified to carry just 85 people, less than a quarter of the number of passengers that airlines squeeze into their versions. Nonetheless, said several aviation experts, under most conditions Mr. Bush's plane would still use less fuel per passenger-mile than a Gulfstream II, the jet owned by Mr. Kerry's wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerry's energy use on the ground became a political issue after he said to reporters on Earth Day, ''I don't own an S.U.V.'' Asked about the Chevrolet Suburban at his home in Ketchum, Idaho, he replied that it belonged to his wife. ''The family has it,'' he said, The Associated Press reported. ''I don't have it.''</p>
        <p>The Republican National Committee responded with a news release, headlined, ''The Boston Fog Rolls Over Kerry's Chevy Suburban,'' noting Mr. Kerry's support for higher fuel-efficiency standards and pointing out that the Suburban gets 16 miles per gallon. But that is still slightly better than the fuel economy of the Cadillac limousine Mr. Bush uses in Washington and the Ford F520 pickup truck he drives at his ranch in Crawford, Tex.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's fondness for taking a chain saw to the trees at his ranch doesn't do much for his environmentalist image, especially when he goes on to burn them, thereby releasing greenhouse gases. But he has an excuse, said Ken Walsh, who toured the ranch with Mr. Bush while researching a book about presidential homes.</p>
        <p>''He seems to be just fixated with clearing cedar because he's been told the cedar strangles other plants and drains water away from them,'' Mr. Walsh said. ''They're trying to restore the place to its natural state with native plants.'' The Bushes also like to show off the energy-saving features at the ranch, including a geothermal heat pump.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerry has generally been an outspoken supporter of renewable energy, but he faces a tricky problem at his home in Nantucket, Mass., where some of his neighbors are trying to stop the construction of a large wind farm, which is supported by environmental groups. The neighbors say it will be too noisy and create an eyesore. Mr. Kerry says he is ready to support the project but with a big caveat: He is waiting to see the environmental impact statement.</p>
        <p>Pentagon Discloses Woodward Style</p>
        <p>BOB WOODWARD has yet to write a how-to guide like ''The Seven Secrets to Secret Sources'' or ''Interview Styles of the Great and Powerful,'' but a few tips are now available thanks to the Pentagon's release of transcripts of his interviews with Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld. An analysis reveals some techniques of the well-connected journalist.</p>
        <p>Nod frequently. To get ahead, Mr. Woodward repeatedly offers Mr. Rumsfeld encouragements like ''I agree,'' ''Well said,'' ''That's great,'' ''Thank God,'' ''No question,'' ''I am totally in sync with you on that'' and ''I totally understand exactly what you're saying.'' When Mr. Rumsfeld mentions the ''enormous numbers of hours'' spent by Mr. Bush deciding on the war, Mr. Woodward replies: ''It's an exercise in patience, not impatience. Would you agree withthat?'' He gets no quarrel.</p>
        <p>Praise his boss. ''Whether you like what the president did or don't like it, it is one of the gutsiest calls in history,'' Mr. Woodward says, alluding to the decision to go to war. He marvels at the many briefings of Mr. Bush and says, ''He really had his hands in it, didn't he?'' Mr. Rumsfeld adds his own dollops, telling how he and his wife ''invariably'' return from an evening at the White House and say, ''Isn't that just a delight to be working with a person who is that way, who is that straightforward, that open, that comfortable with himself, that rooted -- that has the confidence, courage, I guess the words you've used.''</p>
        <p>Drop names. Mr. Woodward keeps reminding Mr. Rumsfeld of all the people he has already interviewed, like Tommy Franks, the commander of the war: ''I spent four hours with General Franks, which someone said is 10 times more than he spent with anyone else.''</p>
        <p>When all else fails, drop the big one. After listening to Mr. Rumsfeld complain about his questions, Mr. Woodward resorts to the classic I'll-tell-the-teacher technique. ''I have a good relationship with President Bush,'' he says, ''and he wants me to do this, I think, as you know.''</p>
