        <p>Mexican Villagers Bury Victims of Chiapas Killings  The men of several small Mexican villages dug graves and began to identify the 45 people massacred in Acteal by a gang of armed men. The victims, which included 9 children and a baby, bring to at least 300 the number of people killed in the rugged southern state of Chiapas since clashes began four years ago between Indian guerrillas fighting for greater rights and armed militia members opposed to their cause.</p>

        <p>Zambian Ex-President Arrested  The former President of Zambia was arrested by paramilitary police as part of a Government crackdown on opposition leaders after an attempted coup in October. The arrest of Kenneth D. Kaunda, the 73-year-old statesman who led the country to independence in 1964, is likely to heighten political tensions in Zambia, where people have been living for two months under what amounts to a police state and where a siege mentality seems to have infected the ruling party.</p>

        <p>Pope Warns of Forgotten Poor  In his Christmas message, Pope John Paul issued a ringing appeal to the well-off not to forget the growing multitude of ''new poor'' and the people still yearning for freedom in countries around the world. The frail-looking 77-year-old Polish Pontiff, celebrating his 20th Christmas as leader of the Roman Catholic Church, made his appeal in his traditional ''Urbi et Orbi'' (to the city and the world) message and blessing.</p>

        <p>Cubans Celebrate Christmas  Cubans celebrated Christmas as a public holiday for the first time in nearly three decades. President Fidel Castro announced earlier this month that Dec. 25 would be a holiday this year to honor the Pope, who is visiting Cuba in January. Cuba dropped Christmas as a holiday in 1969 as the country strove to produce a record sugar harvest.</p>

        <p>Queen Elizabeth Reviews 1997  Calling 1997 a year of ''joy and woe,'' Queen Elizabeth spoke in her Christmas message of the shock of Princess Diana's death and the happiness of her own golden wedding anniversary. In the longest royal Christmas message since George V began the national tradition in 1932 -- nine minutes and 55 seconds -- the Queen departed from the stuffy tones of past broadcasts. She discussed the royal family's emotional roller-coaster in 1997 as well as Britain's loss of Hong Kong and even the devolution of more political power to Scotland and Wales.</p>

        <p>More Die in Algerian Violence  Algeria took another step to complete a parliamentary election, but the death toll in two massacres this week rose to 90 civilians, mostly children and women. In the election, most of the representatives chosen by local councils for the new upper house were followers of President Liamine Zeroual. The Interior Minister, Mustapha Benmansour, said that the National Democratic Rally won 80 of the 96 contested seats.</p>

        <p>Seinfeld to End His Show After Current TV Season  ''Seinfeld,'' the most popular television comedy of the 1990's and the centerpiece of the most profitable night in television history, will stop production at the end of this season, said Jerry Seinfeld, the show's creator and star.</p>

        <p>Early Admissions Gain Ground  With January deadlines for college applications still ahead, some of the country's most selective universities have already filled large portions of next fall's freshman class, a growing trend of the past few years that is changing the rules of college admissions. Officials of some institutions say the numbers have been rising because they find themselves faced with a group of savvy, accomplished and focused early applicants to whom they cannot say no.</p>

        <p>Fight for Outlaw's Remains  John Wesley Hardin, the notorious 19th-century gunfighter known to have killed more than 30 men, has become the focus of a struggle in Texas between El Paso and the tiny town of Nixon. Both places claim Hardin as their most famous former resident, and Hardin descendants are seeking court approval to move the gunman's remains from El Paso, where he died in 1895 after being shot from behind, to Nixon.</p>

        <p>Storm Kills 3,000 Calves  A winter storm that swept through New Mexico hit a ranch where 15,000 calves are raised for sale to dairy farmers, and it left behind corrals littered with the carcasses of 3,000 calves clustered in a futile effort to keep warm against the barrage of icy wind, snow and rain.</p>

        <p>Threat Seen to Colleges  The number of part-time instructors at colleges and universities has nearly doubled since 1970, and the trend to hiring part-timers as a cost-saving measure now ''threatens the quality of higher education,'' according to a report to be distributed on Saturday at the annual convention of the Modern Language Association of America in Toronto.</p>

        <p>Selling Friendly Forestry  A small group of companies has begun offering consumers wood products from land managed to sustain forests and maintain space for wildlife. The Certified Forest Products Council, based in Beaverton, Ore., and made up of 140 companies, is promoting an idea that is already potent in Europe: people will pay more if they know a product is made with the least harm to forests.</p>

        <p>South Korean Immigrants Reflect on Crisis at Home  South Korean immigrants to America -- who watched their homeland prosper from afar during the past decade -- now find themselves in the unaccustomed position of feeling relatively more well-off as, back home, South Korea tries to dig out from a staggering crisis in its currency and economy. Many immigrants now say that recent events have shown them that the burdens of immigrating -- and learning a new culture and language -- were not a mistake.</p>

        <p>Baby Left at Police Precinct  A Brooklyn woman with a history of neglecting her children left her 8-month-old son in a stroller outside a former police station house in Prospect Heights Christmas morning, officials said. A note was attached to the child, giving both his name and that of the father, the police said. The woman was arrested, and the police said charges were pending. Officials said the baby would likely be placed in foster care.</p>

        <p>Mayor Defends Traffic Plan  Mayor Giuliani, departing from his customarily expansive holiday mood, unleashed a barrage of withering sarcasm on critics of the plan to hasten automobile traffic by erecting barricades that prevent pedestrians from crossing the street at major Midtown intersections. Opponents of the plan are ''anticar'' and have become ''hysterical'' about an experiment still in its infancy, he said. The new traffic pattern began on Tuesday, but, apparently anticipating criticism, the city decided not to announce it until a day later. It will last until Jan. 5, when the police will evaluate how well it worked.</p>

        <p>Holiday Sales Disappoint  A sparkling economy, record-low unemployment and fatter paychecks failed to translate into the big holiday selling season American retailers were counting on. Although industry sales figures will not be released until Jan. 8, retailers and those who watch them estimated that sales rose a scant 2 percent to 3 percent in December from a year earlier -- half the gain some analysts had been touting at the start of the season. Analysts said it underscored the necessity for retailers to come to grips with the diminishing role of Christmas-season sales.</p>

        <p>NEC to Increase U.S. Stake  Japan's top computer maker, NEC, moved to increase its stake in the No. 2 seller of personal computers in the United States, Packard Bell NEC, whose market share and profitability have been under assault. NEC said it would invest $300 million in Packard Bell NEC, boosting its stake in the privately held company to 49 percent from 20 percent.</p>

        <p>Bull Market for Prosecutors  The continuing jurisdictional dispute between Mary Jo White, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan District Attorney, over the case of a compliance officer from a Wall Street firm can be traced to the bull market, which has spawned increasing financial chicanery. The problem is that they both want to take the leading role in prosecuting those kinds of cases.</p>

        <p>Banks Asked to Extend Loans  Japan's Finance Ministry and its central bank put pressure on Japanese banks to support the latest international rescue package for South Korea by extending loans as they come due next week. Japanese banks are the biggest lenders to South Korea, with what is believed to be more than $23 billion outstanding to Korean borrowers -- nearly $14 billion of that due within a year.</p>
