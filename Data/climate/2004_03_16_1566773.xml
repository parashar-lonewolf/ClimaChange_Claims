        <p>The Bush administration says it is rethinking its proposed rules limiting mercury emissions from coal-burning power plants and as a result may tighten the proposal.</p>
        <p>Administration officials, who have been under pressure on the issue from states and environmental groups, are now uncomfortable with analyses indicating that if the proposal is adopted, the Environmental Protection Agency could miss, perhaps by more than a decade, its own 2018 target for reducing those emissions by 70 percent.</p>
        <p>Michael O. Leavitt, who took the helm of the environmental agency only weeks before the proposed regulations were announced, was largely uninvolved in their initial development. But in the last several weeks, E.P.A. employees say, he has immersed himself in briefings about the rules, which have provoked criticism from scientists, state officials and environmental advocates.</p>
        <p>''I've spent hours in briefings,'' Mr. Leavitt said in an interview on Monday. ''I've been crawling through the blueprints of power plants. I've been meeting with people on technology, both engineers and scientists.''</p>
        <p>On Friday, Mr. Leavitt briefed the White House, where, administration officials say, he indicated that his agency would consider exploring tougher alternatives or adjustments to the proposal.</p>
        <p>''What our models now show is that we wouldn't get there as soon as we expected we would,'' Jeffrey Holmstead, assistant environmental protection administrator in charge of the air office, said of the agency's goal in an interview on Sunday. ''We are looking at things that fall within the basic structure of the proposal that could be slightly different variations of what we proposed.''</p>
        <p>Coal-burning power plants are currently the nation's largest source of unregulated emissions of mercury, spewing about 48 tons of it a year, equivalent to some 40 percent of all human-caused mercury emissions. But court-ordered deadlines, resulting from a lawsuit that environmental groups brought against the Clinton administration, mandated the E.P.A.'s introduction of a mercury proposal by last Dec. 15, with a final rule due on Dec. 15 of this year.</p>
        <p>The proposal that the Bush administration offered in December, and that it is now reconsidering, would allow power plants to buy and sell among themselves, starting in 2010, a limited right to pollute with mercury, much as with the current regulation of sulfur dioxide, a component of acid rain. Environmental groups, calling that approach questionable under the Clean Air Act, favor a stricter system that would force all power plants to install pollution controls by 2007, a deadline utility companies call technically unfeasible.</p>
        <p>E.P.A. staff members have themselves complained that analysis has been unusually limited for a regulation so complex.</p>
        <p>''The most important point is that the analysis isn't complete,'' Mr. Leavitt said in the interview. ''I've asked for an array of additional analysis to be done.''</p>
        <p>Mercury has become a politically delicate issue for the administration, particularly in the Great Lakes States, some of them expected to be closely fought in the presidential election and, because of mercury pollution, almost all with statewide water-contamination warnings about eating fish.</p>
        <p>Mercury is also an issue among another important constituency: women. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that one in eight women have mercury concentration in their bodies that exceeds safety levels. And scientists at the environmental agency recently said that of some four million babies born a year, 630,000 -- double the previous estimate -- might have been exposed as fetuses to unsafe levels of mercury. In January, a committee of doctors advising the children's health office of the agency sent a letter to Mr. Leavitt raising concern that the proposed rules did not provide enough protection for children.</p>
        <p>Further, since the proposal was issued in December, several states, Connecticut and New Jersey among them, have moved to regulate mercury pollution more strictly than the administration would.</p>
        <p>The administration's proposal calls for utilities' caps on mercury emissions to be gradually reduced while the system of trading among them proceeds from 2010 to 2018. By then, if the administration's goal was realized, mercury emissions would be reduced by 70 percent from current levels.</p>
        <p>But a crucial concern among administration officials is that the trading system allows companies that reduce mercury pollution levels ahead of schedule to ''save'' those credits to apply later, when the control levels become more strict. Internal environmental agency analysis shows that ''saving'' would mean actual pollution reduction of only about 50 percent by 2018. Members of the agency's staff say models show that the goal of 70 percent would not be achieved even by 2025 and perhaps not until after 2030.</p>
        <p>Mr. Holmstead, the assistant administrator, said those forecasts might not be accurate, however, in part because the agency's models do not build in the assumption that mercury controls will become cheaper, and so more appealing to the utilities, as time passes.</p>
