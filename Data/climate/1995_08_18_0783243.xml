        <p>The veil of brown smog that perpetually hangs over Mexico City, stinging the eyes and burning the throats of the nearly 20 million people who live here, is not caused primarily by automobile exhaust as officials have long believed, according to a study by an American scientist. Rather it is caused by leaks from millions of steel tanks containing bottled gas used for cooking and heating.</p>
        <p>The surprising findings, to be published in the United States on Friday in the journal Science, contradict a decade of Government environmental policy that has focused heavily on curtailing emissions from cars and factories while ignoring controls on the two million tons of liquefied petroleum gas used each year for cooking and heating in virtually every home in Mexico City.</p>
        <p>Mexican officials will be hard pressed to ignore the conclusions because they are made by F. Sherwood Rowland, a chemist at the University of California at Irvine. It was Dr. Rowland who, with a colleague, in 1974 first warned that man-made chlorinated chemicals widely used in refrigeration were destroying the earth's protective ozone layer.</p>
        <p>Dr. Rowland was assisted in the Mexican study by Donald R. Blake, a senior research associate at the Irvine campus.</p>
        <p>Mexico's environmental ministry is studying the findings and could make recommendations about the way bottled gas is made and sold in Mexico. The Government-run oil monopoly Pemex, which produces the liquefied gas, is considering changes in the composition of the gas that could make the leaks less harmful.</p>
        <p>But the head of environmental programs in Mexico City said he disagrees with Dr. Rowland, arguing that while liquefied gas undoubtedly escapes into the atmosphere, further study is needed before it can be blamed for harmful ozone.</p>
        <p>"We continue to believe that automobiles generate 70 percent of the contaminants in the atmosphere," said the official, Eduardo Palazuelos Rendon, environmental secretary for Mexico City, whose agency has for several years encouraged companies to convert delivery trucks to use liquefied petroleum gas. "The conclusion that L.P.G. is a major contaminant does not represent a defect in our programs but rather a defect in the study."</p>
        <p>In his study, Dr. Rowland analyzed about 200 air samples taken in Mexico City from 1992 to 1995, and found high levels of alkane hydrocarbons, usually only minor components of auto exhaust, but which clearly mark the presence of a fossil fuel like liquefied petroleum gas.</p>
        <p>"We were just looking to see what was there," Dr. Rowland said in a telephone interview. "And as soon as we looked at the composition we realized it was different from most U.S. cities because of the high levels of butane and propane," which, with more volatile butene, are major ingredients in Mexico's bottled gas.</p>
        <p>Liquefied petroleum gas sold in the United States has a higher percentage of propane and almost none of the environmentally harmful butane and butene found in Mexico.</p>
        <p>Previous scientific studies of Mexico City's polluted air have either ignored the presence of the liquid gas or inadequately explained its impact, Dr. Rowland said.</p>
        <p>He concluded that extensive leaks from the gas containers and the incomplete burning of the gas in millions of old stoves and space heaters plays "a major (perhaps the dominant) role" in producing harmful ozone in the Mexico City area.</p>
        <p>Ozone is dangerous when people breathe it, but in the stratosphere, far above the earth's surface, it is essential to limit the ultraviolet radiation the planet receives.</p>
        <p>Of course, auto exhaust and industrial emissions also contribute to Mexico City's smog, identified by a United Nations study in 1992 as the worst in the world.</p>
        <p>To combat the worsening pollution, the Government shut down a huge oil refinery several years ago and began production of unleaded gasoline. In 1989 it also tried to force residents to leave their cars home one work day every week. However, many people went out and bought another, often older and more polluting car to use on those days.</p>
        <p>"The program is not misguided, it just is not complete," Dr. Rowland said. "They do need to work on automobiles, they do need to reduce hydrocarbons from any source. But the efforts are incomplete if they haven't thought about what to do to control L.P.G."</p>
        <p>Doing something about the gas will not be easy. Thirty-two independent companies make an estimated 200,000 deliveries a day, installing tanks without Government supervision in homes with often neglected pipes and tubes.</p>
