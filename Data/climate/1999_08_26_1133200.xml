        <p>I HAD gone to Landcraft Environments, a wholesale nursery in Mattituck, N.Y., to see hardy bananas I could supposedly grow in my vegetable garden. And there they were, a whole grove, their bright green paddle-like six-foot leaves swaying in the 100-degree breeze as if they'd spent the last few million years evolving on sandy Long Island.</p>
        <p>''It's root hardy to minus 10 degrees,'' Dennis Schrader said as we stood under the welcome shade of the plants, Musa basjoo, Japanese fiber bananas that can reach 16 feet in a single North Fork summer. ''We let the whole top get hit by hard frost,'' he added. ''Then we wrap the stem with straw and plastic and then burlap, and then put a spackle bucket over it.''</p>

        <p>I HAD gone to Landcraft Environments, a wholesale nursery in Mattituck, N.Y., to see hardy bananas I could supposedly grow in my vegetable garden. And there they were, a whole grove, their bright green paddle-like six-foot leaves swaying in the 100-degree breeze as if they'd spent the last few million years evolving on sandy Long Island.</p>
        <p>''It's root hardy to minus 10 degrees,'' Dennis Schrader said as we stood under the welcome shade of the plants, Musa basjoo, Japanese fiber bananas that can reach 16 feet in a single North Fork summer. ''We let the whole top get hit by hard frost,'' he added. ''Then we wrap the stem with straw and plastic and then burlap, and then put a spackle bucket over it.''</p>
        <p>Ha ha. The bucket is a little salute to the Italian tradition of wrapping your beloved fig tree, which, after all, is a Mediterranean plant. So every fall, after a hard freeze, you wrap your big baby, leaving a little vent at the top for those sunny days in February when all that plastic turns into a solar greenhouse. Then you put the beat-up bucket over its head to keep out the icy rain and snow. But if you get a warm winter day, you take off the bucket. Such tender loving care assumes that you are home all day long, making pasta in the kitchen, changing diapers and so on, and can run out to the yard every whipstitch to put the bucket on or take it off. Same thing with a banana plant.</p>
        <p>''I see,'' I said.</p>
        <p>''Or,'' Mr. Schrader added quickly, ''you can just cut it down to the base after a hard freeze. Mulch with about eight inches of wood chips. The small pups come up in the spring.'' The pups are the little shoots that rise off the rhizomes of the root-hardy plant, forming big plants of their own. But that takes a while, so your banana won't be as tall by frost.</p>
        <p>''If you wrap it,'' he continued, ''the leaves start growing right from the stem. By May, we have leafy bananas 10 to 12 feet tall.'' A tempting thought. But having killed enough figs for a lifetime -- by forgetting the bucket -- I'll have to whack.</p>
        <p>We stood listening to the gentle crackling of those big green paddles in the wind. I could picture my own banana grove down in Maryland, looming like a mirage in the potato patch. The farmers would think they were hallucinating in the drought.</p>
        <p>Which reminds me. Banana plants are water guzzlers. So if you haven't had rain in a couple of years, go for agaves.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schrader and his partner, Bill Smith, started growing tropical and subtropical plants, along with unusual annuals, 20 years ago when they couldn't find the plants they needed for a growing garden-design clientele. They soon filled the greenhouse behind their house and started longing for something more rural, with a view. They found it in 1992, in a rundown 1840's farmhouse on 17 acres of potato fields half a mile from Long Island Sound.</p>
        <p>Now, seven years later, they are growing 700 kinds of plants, testing many of them in their trial gardens, which are occasionally on the garden-tour circuit. But Landcraft is mainly a workhorse, supplying plants for high-end nurseries, garden designers, public gardens and zoos in the Northeast.</p>
        <p>You see tropical plants everywhere these days, from the banana plants and giant elephant ears in elegant public gardens like Wave Hill in the Bronx to those hideous, frilly coleus at Home Depot. But at Landcraft, it's not a Victorian resurgence of ruffles and chartreuse. It's as if all the plants in the world had been tossed up in the air and landed among the oaks, the butterfly bushes, the hydrangeas and roses in the mixed border.</p>
        <p>''My design theory is just a matter of form, color and texture,'' Mr. Schrader said. ''It doesn't matter what plant it is, as long as its cultural requirements are met. If the color of a tropical works with a native woodland plant, why not use it?''</p>
        <p>We stood by a pin oak underplanted with a six-foot Australian tree fern and a sea of a fiery coleus named Alabama Sunset. Its salmon leaves vibrated like tuning forks against the pink fur of the tree fern's stems. And those banana plants were growing next to holly trees! That seemed an almost perverse disregard for plant communities, like making a cat sleep next to a mouse.</p>
        <p>''The world is becoming so global,'' Mr. Schrader said. ''I can fax New Zealand and have seeds within two days, so why stick to native plants? There's a French seed company on the Web, where you can search for, say, plants with yellow flowers indigenous to Borneo, and it spits out a list from its database.''</p>
        <p>I wandered around a bit, seeing which plants raised my heart rate. Nine-foot lime-green elephant ears (Alocasia macrorhiza) marching up the drive toward the house. Dracula-like Solanum atropurpureum, its black thorns bristling over bright yellow poisonous berries. Fragrant daturas, with eight-inch white trumpets laced with lavender, surrounded by chest-high red millet. Washingtonia palms rising out of blooming mint, yarrow and bronze fennel.</p>
        <p>What mad plant lover could not fall down and worship here? I loved the tropical Aristolochia littoralis, dangling its bawdy veined pouches from a rustic arbor that faces a little pond full of lotus, papyrus, waterlilies and frogs. Mr. Smith built it from a locust tree downed in a storm, and the curving branches, raised like arms to support the top of the pergola, evoke the saguaro cactuses of Arizona. Agaves and cycads, those plants that survived the dinosaurs, coexist on the bluestone terrace in an exhilarating confluence of climates and time zones.</p>
        <p>In other places, it feels like too many ingredients stirred into the soup: the double border of peegee hydrangeas, David Austin roses, variegated corn, pineapple lilies, Egyptian onions, red cannas and Mexican feather grass, which looks like a mop of bleached hair.</p>
        <p>''We want you to throw out the rules and toss those pastel color schemes and sedate native plants on the compost heap and create something wild and riveting,'' Mr. Schrader and Susan Roth, a photographer and garden designer, write in their book, ''Hot Plants for Cool Climates,'' due out from Houghton Mifflin early next year. The book not only offers readers a taste of the best tropical-style gardens in the country but also catalogues some 500 plants, complete with cultivation tips (how to wrap that banana, for instance, or dig up those elephant ears and store them in the cellar).</p>
        <p>If you are wondering about tropical plants invading the next township, don't worry, the authors say: they die off after a hard freeze. (So don't send any slips to Aunt Mabel in Louisiana, though I know you will.)</p>
        <p>I still hate that blasted coleus, but I love the vision of black elephant ears rising like African shields over my little bed of ruby beets. Though this water issue troubles me. Maryland's corn crop bit the dust this summer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schrader is quick to point out that many tropicals are desert dwellers. So if global warming turns New York into some kind of New Arizona, start thinking cycads and saracenia. Let's leap back a few million years to plants that knew better than to grow leaves, much less flowers and berries and stuff. It takes too much energy for a world covered in dust.</p>
