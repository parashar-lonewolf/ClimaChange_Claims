        <p>Robert B. Catell, who joined the Brooklyn Union Gas Company as a 21-year-old mechanical engineer in 1958, was named its president and chief executive yesterday. On June 1, he will succeed Elwin S. Larson, who is retiring, as head of the nation's fifth-largest gas distribution company.</p>
        <p>As chief executive of a regulated utility serving more than one million customers in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island, the Brooklyn-born-and-bred Mr. Catell said he hoped to uphold century-old traditions and break new ground.</p>
        <p>"The opportunities for natural gas have never been greater," he said. "There's an opportunity to take Brooklyn Union to a new level."</p>
        <p>To sustain growth in a mature market, where 75 percent of single-family homes already use gas, his main strategy will be to increase customer satisfaction. For the last several years, while he has been Brooklyn Union's chief operating officer, the company has emphasized solving customers' problems the first time a complaint is made. Brooklyn Union has invested heavily in computers, including hand-held computers for workers who are in the field.</p>
        <p>Mr. Catell also has his eye on entirely new markets for natural gas, including its use as a fuel for cars and air-conditioners. Citing rising concern over New York City's ability to meet the standards set by the Clean Air Act, Brooklyn Union is promoting the use of gas -- the cleanest of the fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>As part of a demonstration project, natural gas is powering 10 United Parcel Service delivery vans and 15 Parks Department trucks. Gas-powered air-conditioning, Mr. Catell said, is another market for the future.</p>
        <p>Since entering management in 1974, Mr. Catell has been a champion of finding new sources of natural gas. He was an early proponent of buying gas from Canada, where supplies are ample, and helped organize the Iroquois Pipeline project, in which a pipeline being laid under the Long Island Sound will deliver natural gas from Canada.</p>
        <p>Mr. Catell was also a proponent of the company's diversification, which has been under way since the 70's. Brooklyn Union now owns an oil and gas exploration concern, a co-generation operation and a propane distribution subsidiary. Partly as a result, the utility has raised its dividend in each of the last 15 years and reported earnings close to the maximum allowed by regulators in the last 12 years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Catell is active in community organizations, including work for his alma mater, City College, and various programs that assist low-income families. He is a sports fan and avid reader of mysteries. He and his wife, Joan, have five children, the youngest 16 years old.  BUSINESS PEOPLE</p>
