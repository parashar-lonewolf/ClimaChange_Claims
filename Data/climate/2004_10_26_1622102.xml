        <p>IF John Kerry is elected, he will win with one of the longest but least clear-cut records of any candidate in modern times, with a personal life shaped by early independence and youthful service under fire and a public career that has blended liberal orthodoxies with stabs of skepticism and episodes of sailing against the wind.</p>
        <p>Since he burst onto the national stage 33 years ago as a decorated Vietnam veteran who became an outspoken opponent of that war, Mr. Kerry has often seemed a collection of contrasts and complexities. In his home state, Massachusetts, and in the halls of the Senate for nearly 20 years, he has been a politician more respected than loved, and his public reserve makes him a remote figure to many Americans even now.</p>
        <p>''I came to do a job, not join a club,'' he told an interviewer during his first Senate term.</p>
        <p>Indeed, while Mr. Kerry's achievements have propelled him into some of the nation's most exclusive clubs, from the elite St. Paul's School, to the secret Skull and Bones society at Yale, to the Senate itself, he has always stood apart -- a member in good standing but not one of the boys. There is every reason to think that he would conduct the presidency with the same calibrated pragmatism that has marked his career as a protester, prosecutor and politician.</p>
        <p>On the campaign trail this year, he has pledged to roll back the tax cuts that President Bush and Congress gave to the wealthiest Americans, but to preserve those for the middle class.</p>
        <p>He would use tax credits and subsidies to buttress the employer-based health care system and bring more low income children and adults into public-insurance programs, but not create a new government bureaucracy. And he vows to seek renewed international cooperation to stabilize Iraq, not withdraw in haste.</p>
        <p>''There are two kinds of Democrats in Massachusetts,'' said Dan Payne, a Boston media consultant who worked on many of Mr. Kerry's past campaigns. ''There are relationship Democrats, where the whole world is defined by who people know, and there are ideological Democrats. Kerry has always been a person who has advanced ideas. He's not a relationship guy.''</p>
        <p>If Mr. Kerry's relationships are complex, so are his ideas. Based on his roll call votes in 2003, The National Journal ranked him the most liberal member of the Senate. But his lifetime voting -- and speaking -- record is considerably more complicated than that ranking would suggest.</p>
        <p>On some issues, including gun control, gay rights and the environment, Mr. Kerry has a long liberal history. He has earned a lifetime 96 percent ''right'' voting record from the League of Conservation Voters. His lifetime score from the A.F.L.-C.I.O. is 90 percent, while his rating by the American Conservative Union stands at just 6 percent.</p>
        <p>But on many issues, Mr. Kerry has taken more nuanced positions. After the Republicans took control of Congress in 1994, Mr. Kerry proclaimed himself ''delighted with seeing an institutional shake-up, because I think we need one.''</p>
        <p>A few months later, with President Bill Clinton locked in combat with the Republicans, Mr. Kerry voiced some doubts in a closed-door meeting of senators about the wisdom of trying to raise the minimum wage. Senator Edward M. Kennedy later recalled that he told Mr. Kerry, ''If you're not for raising the minimum wage, you don't deserve to call yourself a Democrat.''</p>
        <p>At times, Mr. Kerry has taken positions that cut against the Democratic grain. In a 1998 speech, he expressed sympathy for parents who supported vouchers for private schools, called for more experiments with charter schools and said it was time to ''end teacher tenure as we know it.'' In 1997, he voted to require some elderly people who could afford to do so to pay a higher share of Medicare premiums.</p>
        <p>Typically, Mr. Kerry has raised such hot potatoes only to drop them in the face of predictable opposition from Democratic constituency groups. But he has not shied away from other thankless and daunting tasks that intrigued him, including the chairmanship of a select committee that in the early 1990's concluded there was no evidence that any American prisoners of war were still alive in Vietnam, which helped pave the way for Mr. Clinton's normalization of relations with that country.</p>
        <p>Perhaps more than anything else, Mr. Kerry's Senate career has been characterized by curiosity, and he has made a bigger mark as an investigator than as a legislator. He pursued high-profile inquiries into the Bank of Credit and Commerce International and Gen. Manuel Noriega of Panama. He won support for a resolution warning Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines that American aid would be conditioned on democratic changes, then helped monitor a Philippine election in which documentation of fraud hastened the ascension of Coraz√≥n Aquino.</p>
        <p>A longtime member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Kerry is intimately versed in issues like intelligence-gathering, global climate change, AIDS policy, nuclear proliferation, international crime and counterterrorism. But his four months of Navy service in the Mekong Delta also left him perennially skeptical and deliberate about the use of American power in the world. He voted against the 1991 Persian Gulf war and in favor of authorizing the current President Bush to use force to disarm Saddam Hussein, then voted against money to finance the postwar occupation, on grounds that Mr. Bush had bungled the job.</p>
        <p>''We may well have to use force to fight terrorism,'' Mr. Kerry said in announcing his campaign last year, a refrain he has often echoed. ''I will not hesitate to do so. But if I am president, the United States will never go to war because we want to, we will only go to war because we have to.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerry comes by his complexities naturally. His mother, Rosemary, was descended from two of New England's most venerable Colonial families, while his father, Richard, came from Czech-Austrian parents who had been born Jewish and converted to Catholicism. Mr. Kerry's father was a diplomat and his mother's family lived in France, so Mr. Kerry spent part of his youth in Europe, biking around postwar Berlin. His parents sent him to a Swiss boarding school when he was 11, and he eventually wound up at St. Paul's, in Concord, N.H., where he was a rare Catholic and Democrat in a sea of Episcopal Republicans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerry was sometimes lonely, but he learned self-sufficiency at an early age. ''I saw a lot of things that really gave me a sense of history, and a sense of responsibility,'' he said. ''The cold war was on us, it was just very definitive, a clash of humankind. So as a kid, there was a great curiosity, romance, adventure.''</p>
        <p>Partly to satisfy that curiosity, Mr. Kerry enlisted in the Navy, then volunteered for service in Vietnam, where he won Silver and Bronze Stars and three Purple Hearts, and once beached his patrol boat to chase and shoot a Vietcong fighter. He would be one of a handful of American presidents ever to have personally killed in battle.</p>
        <p>''John knew more about where we were in Vietnam than any of us had known,'' said Thomas Vallely, an old friend and fellow veteran who now leads the Vietnam program at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. ''He had that ability to see Vietnam more clearly than we could.''</p>
        <p>In his up-and-down campaign this year, Mr. Kerry, 60, has sometimes struggled to convey similar clarity. His aides attest that he is a meticulous decision maker, always calling around for one more piece of advice, one more fact, one more document -- a pattern that they acknowledge can sometimes slow down decision making.</p>
        <p>But time and again, Mr. Kerry has proved himself most disciplined and focused in the crunch, whether in the brown waters off Vietnam, in the frozen cornfields of Iowa, where his caucus victory against the odds last winter set him off on the road to the nomination, or in the three televised debates this fall, in which polls showed the public solidly believed he outperformed Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>If the modern presidency amounts to one perpetual crisis, Mr. Kerry might well have a good idea of just what he is in for.</p>
