        <p>Representative Charles E.

        <p>Representative Charles E. Schumer brought his campaign for the United States Senate to the edge of Long Island Sound today, accepting endorsements from several environmental groups and saying that Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato had done nothing to protect the waters surrounding his home base of Long Island.</p>
        <p>''People love the environment here,'' Mr. Schumer said as water lapped and geese honked in the background. ''And shame of it all, the Senator who hails from Nassau County has a record at the bottom of the environmental barrel.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schumer, a Democrat from Brooklyn, received endorsements from the New York League of Conservation Voters and the national Sierra Club, whose representatives said he had consistently voted to protect the environment during his 18 years in Congress. In particular, they said, Mr. Schumer voted against weakening the Clean Water Act in 1995 and against delaying the removal of toxic PCB's from the Hudson River and other waterways in 1998.</p>
        <p>In comparison, the environmental advocates said, Mr. D'Amato, a Republican, voted to decrease funds for the cleanup of toxic waste sites and to weaken the ability of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency to enforce clean air standards, both in 1995. Mr. D'Amato has occasionally voted to protect the environment, but only in years when he was up for re-election, they said.</p>
        <p>''The D'Amato effect, as I describe it, is the curious behavior of the Senator from New York, every six years, to suddenly turn good on the environment,'' said Chuck McGrady, the national president of the Sierra Club.</p>
        <p>''This race is very simple to understand in environmental terms,'' Mr. McGrady said. ''Chuck Schumer is there, protecting our special places.''</p>
        <p>Carol E. Browner, the head of the E.P.A., also appeared with Mr. Schumer here and praised his environmental record. ''You have a choice between a candidate who has been strong on the environment and someone who is sort of a fair-weather friend,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Harvey Valentine, a spokesman for Mr. D'Amato, said the Senator was ''proud'' of his environmental voting record, which he said included ''fighting to protect New York's forests, lakes and streams from the devastating effects of acid rain'' and ''securing millions of dollars for the purchase of natural-gas buses.''</p>
