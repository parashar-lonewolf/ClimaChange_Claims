        <p>Editorial Observer comment on New York political game of waiting for Geraldine Ferraro to decide whether she will run for US Senate</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Before she decides whether to run for the United States Senate, Geraldine Ferraro says she has to assures herself that she would be ''the best person to deliver for New York State.'' Thousands of politicians have used a similar test over the last 220 years. Remarkably few have ever wound up concluding that there are probably other people who could do the job better.</p>
        <p>Thanks to Ms. Ferraro, the infant 1998 Senate race has become a political version of ''Waiting for Godot.'' The announced Democratic candidates, Public Advocate Mark Green and Representative Charles Schumer, still have the lead parts, standing in the spotlight, talking endlessly. (The roles they were born to play!) Senator Al D'Amato occasionally comes onstage to make hostile gestures at random targets. (Acid rain, breast cancer, teachers' unions, whatever. New York's junior Senator is belligerent on your behalf.) Meanwhile, the focus of all interest is staying out of sight.</p>

        <p>Before she decides whether to run for the United States Senate, Geraldine Ferraro says she has to assures herself that she would be ''the best person to deliver for New York State.'' Thousands of politicians have used a similar test over the last 220 years. Remarkably few have ever wound up concluding that there are probably other people who could do the job better.</p>
        <p>Thanks to Ms. Ferraro, the infant 1998 Senate race has become a political version of ''Waiting for Godot.'' The announced Democratic candidates, Public Advocate Mark Green and Representative Charles Schumer, still have the lead parts, standing in the spotlight, talking endlessly. (The roles they were born to play!) Senator Al D'Amato occasionally comes onstage to make hostile gestures at random targets. (Acid rain, breast cancer, teachers' unions, whatever. New York's junior Senator is belligerent on your behalf.) Meanwhile, the focus of all interest is staying out of sight.</p>
        <p>Thirteen years after she ran for Vice President, Geraldine Ferraro is still that increasingly rare commodity, a political celebrity. In a rational world, January would be more than enough time for someone with her level of recognition to prepare for an election 10 months away. But it is  hard to be spontaneous when you are talking about a race that could easily wind up costing its contenders $20 million each. Mr. Schumer has been saving for this campaign so long he probably has his eighth grade graduation money in the war chest.</p>
        <p>Some Democrats think Mr. D'Amato would like to run against a potentially underfinanced Ms. Ferraro. That might explain the peculiar attack ads he ran briefly this fall, blasting her as a tax-and-spend liberal. They may have been an attempt to goad her into the race. Otherwise, it is hard to imagine what the Senator thought he could accomplish by lambasting the record of a woman who has not held office since 1984. How many people out there are still stewing over the 1979 welfare bill?</p>
        <p>''I can raise the money,'' Ms. Ferraro said. ''I'll be doing it full time. I'll be on the phone six hours a day.''</p>
        <p>If Ms. Ferraro has been stalling just to avoid those six-hour fund-raising marathons, who can blame her? (''You sit in a darkened room,'' said one veteran politician. ''And you call and call, and soon you hear yourself saying things like: 'After the election, I'll look forward to hearing more about your interesting ideas on a death penalty for shoplifting.' '') But it does raise the question of how hungry she really is for this job. None of Ms. Ferraro's experiences in electoral politics outside the borough of Queens have been all that pleasant. After that transcendent moment in 1984 when she was nominated as Walter Mondale's running mate, her campaign degenerated into a long, gory argument about tax returns and ended with a pioneering appearance as the first female Vice-Presidential nominee to appear in a Diet Pepsi commercial. She lost the Senate primary in 1992 after Elizabeth Holtzman ran television ads charging her with ''collecting $340,000 from a child pornographer.''</p>
        <p>Most of Ms. Ferraro's campaign woes have been related to the real estate business of her husband, John Zaccaro. Nevertheless, Ms. Ferraro never seems to have made an effort to sever herself from her husband's operations, and she has entered one election after another with a stunning lack of concern about how the issue would be handled. Asked if she was still an officer in her husband's real estate company, Ms. Ferraro claimed she didn't know. ''I may be -- probably,'' she said. ''It doesn't mean anything.''</p>
        <p>Back in February, the former Congresswoman sent a letter to New York Democrats asking them to stay uncommitted until early 1998. She would get back to them then, she wrote, ''either to tell you I love you for waiting but I've decided to put an end to my public service career, or I love you and I need you to help me send Al D'Amato back to Island Park.'' If Ms. Ferraro opts for the Island Park scenario, she will be betting that for a politician with her unique history and charisma, all you need is love.</p>
