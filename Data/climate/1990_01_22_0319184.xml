        <p>LEAD: President Bush, reversing his previous position, would accept a vote in Congress to make the Environmental Protection Agency a Cabinet-level department, Administration officials say.</p>
        <p>President Bush, reversing his previous position, would accept a vote in Congress to make the Environmental Protection Agency a Cabinet-level department, Administration officials say.</p>
        <p>Before he took office, Mr. Bush said he did not want to add to the Cabinet because he wanted to keep it a manageable size; it now has 14 members. But, the officials said, the President's growing appreciation of the need for global cooperation on environmental problems, the profound implications of E.P.A. programs on all parts of society and the rising public interest in such issues have helped persuade him to drop his opposition.</p>
        <p>Legislation to make the E.P.A. a Cabinet department is scheduled to be introduced in the House of Representatives this week. On the Senate side, a similar measure is expected to be introduced shortly. Two Democratic supporters of the legislation, Representative Mike Synar of Oklahoma and Senator John Glenn of Ohio, said they believe that prospects for passage of the legislation this year are good.</p>
        <p>Mixed Reviews</p>
        <p>The agency was created in 1970 in an executive order by President Richard M. Nixon, who was responding to a sudden explosion of public concern about the environment. In its two decades, the E.P.A. has carried out all the landmark environmental statutes enacted by Congress, including the Clean Air and Water Acts and the toxic waste laws.</p>
        <p>As an independent agency, the E.P.A. has a lower rank than Cabinet departments under Federal protocol. Raising the agency's status, proponents argue, would give it more power in dealing with other Government agencies and foreign governments and would give the head of the agency a permanent seat in Cabinet counsels.</p>
        <p>Administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mr. Bush recently discussed the matter with the E.P.A. Administrator, William K. Reilly, and told him that if there was enough sentiment in Congress to make the agency a Cabinet department he would not object. Mr. Reilly would neither confirm the report nor give his views on the subject.</p>
        <p>The officials said they did not expect the President to take the initiative in proposing to elevate the department. But they said the fact that he would no longer oppose it enhanced the prospect that the environmental agency could gain Cabinet status this year.</p>
        <p>'Receptive to the Idea'</p>
        <p>Marlin Fitzwater, the President's spokesman, said in a telephone interview on Saturday that ''the senior White House staff is receptive to the idea'' of making the E.P.A. a Cabinet-level department. He added, however, that there had been no formal discussion of the issue with the President, and that he did not know whether the President's views on enlarging the Cabinet had changed.</p>
        <p>Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan and chairman of the House Committee on Government Operations, plans to introduce the House bill to elevate the E.P.A. this week.</p>
        <p>Raising the status of the agency, Mr. Conyers said, would give its leader a closer relationship to the President, would strengthen and balance the agency's relationships with other Federal agencies and would give it equal standing with foreign environmental ministers.</p>
        <p>''Overcoming the numerous environmental hazards we face - contamination of our air, water and food, depletion of the ozone, global warming, ocean dumping and the proliferation of hazardous wastes - is one of the most critical challenges of our times,'' Mr. Conyers said.</p>
        <p>''Bringing the E.P.A. into the Cabinet is the first major step to confronting the hazards,'' Mr. Conyers said, adding: ''We recognize this act alone will not solve our environmental challenges. But we would be in a much better position to tackle these problems if E.P.A. had a seat at the table along with other Cabinet departments. E.P.A. has grown enormously since its start in 1970, and its programs have profound implications for almost every Government agency.''</p>
        <p>More Respect, Synar Says</p>
        <p>Representative Synar, who intends to co-sponsor the House legislation to elevate the E.P.A., said he was originally cool to the idea but now embraces it. ''The American public wants to put money and emphasis on the environment,'' he said. ''To do that we have to have an effective agency that has the attention and respect of the rest of Government.''</p>
        <p>Two Republicans in the House, Frank Horton of New York and William F. Clinger Jr. of Pennsylvania, will co-sponsor the bill.</p>
        <p>On the Senate side, William V. Roth Jr., Republican of Delaware, will be a co-sponsor.</p>
        <p>Bush and the Environment</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said in his 1988 campaign for the Presidency that he wanted to be known as the ''environmental President.'' And in his first year in office, he took a number of steps that suggest he is more concerned about environmental problems than was his predecessor, Ronald Reagan. Those include his appointment of Mr. Reilly, a career environmental advocate, and his proposed legislation to strengthen the Clean Air Act.</p>
        <p>He has been criticized, however, for other environmental moves, including his slow reaction to the disastrous oil spill from the Exxon Valdez in Alaska's Prince William Sound last year.</p>
        <p>A New York Times/CBS News Poll conducted this month found that 62 percent of the public said they thought President Bush's record on the environment was more talk than action.</p>
        <p>What Bill Would Do</p>
        <p>In addition to elevating the E.P.A. to Cabinet level, Mr. Conyers's bill would accomplish the following:</p>
        <p>* It would establish an office of environmental statistics within the agency to standardize and improve the collection of environmental data.</p>
        <p>* It would set up a system for streamlining the distribution of information about the environment to the public and among various branches of the agency.</p>
        <p>* It would create an ombudsman to represent the public and help individuals, corporations and community groups move through the maze of regulations administered by the agency.</p>
        <p>* It would establish a commission to study the possible reorganization of the E.P.A. to make it more effective. One issue that would be studied would be transferring to the E.P.A.'s jurisdiction other Government bodies involved in environmental affairs, like the Commerce Department's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Army's Corps of Engineers.</p>
        <p>Senator Glenn said his interest in Cabinet status for the agency stems in large part from its role in preserving the global environment.</p>
        <p>''With the new awareness of environmental concerns around the world,'' he said, ''most of the nations are beginning to move ahead of us. The only two major nations that don't have environmental ministries are Italy and the United States. We need to be in a leadership position on global environmental issues.''</p>
