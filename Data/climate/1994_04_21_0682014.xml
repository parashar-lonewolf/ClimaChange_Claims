        <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON has a new "Golden Carrot" refrigerator, the most energy-efficient model in the country, said Catherine R. Zoi, deputy director and chief of staff of the White House Office of Environmental Policy.</p>
        <p>President and Mrs. Clinton and their daughter, Chelsea, now also have recycling bins so they can do their own sorting. Old lighting fixtures in the White House and the Old Executive Office Building have been replaced with energy-efficient models. Water conservation devices have been installed throughout both buildings and even in the sprinkler system on the grounds. And skylights that had been painted or soiled over time have been cleaned and revamped to illuminate and warm stairwells in the Old Executive Office Building.</p>

        <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON has a new "Golden Carrot" refrigerator, the most energy-efficient model in the country, said Catherine R. Zoi, deputy director and chief of staff of the White House Office of Environmental Policy.</p>
        <p>President and Mrs. Clinton and their daughter, Chelsea, now also have recycling bins so they can do their own sorting. Old lighting fixtures in the White House and the Old Executive Office Building have been replaced with energy-efficient models. Water conservation devices have been installed throughout both buildings and even in the sprinkler system on the grounds. And skylights that had been painted or soiled over time have been cleaned and revamped to illuminate and warm stairwells in the Old Executive Office Building.</p>
        <p>The changes are part of the first phase of "the Greening of the White House," a project unveiled last month that officials estimate will decrease energy use by 30 percent by the year 2005, at no additional cost beyond allocated funds. It is also expected to save $140,000 in the next three years on the annual $1.6 million utility bill for the two buildings.</p>
        <p>"This could be Bill and Hillary's legacy," Ms. Zoi said.</p>
        <p>The 22-cubic-foot Golden Carrot, which is made by Whirlpool, was the company's winning entry in a contest sponsored by 24 utility companies, which offered $30 million to the manufacturer that created the most energy-efficient refrigerator. The new refrigerator, which costs between $1,200 and $1,300, exceeds Department of Energy efficiency standards by 30 percent. It contains no chlorofluorocarbons, chemicals used in cooling that have been implicated in the thinning of the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>The "greening" plans are the result of a year's work by 100 environmental experts and consultants, Ms. Zoi said.</p>
        <p>Bill Browning, director of the Rocky Mountain Institute, an environmental group, and one of the experts consulted by the White House, said some of the greatest challenges were making changes while the White House functioned and maintaining the structure's historic fabric and high security.</p>
        <p>Although Ms. Zoi said the White House project "is about setting an example," there is one standard that few American homeowners will try to meet: the coldproof glass is also bulletproof.</p>
