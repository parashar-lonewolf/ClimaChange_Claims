        <p>For all our war memorials and our golden-oldies radio, you could argue -- convincingly, I believe -- that as a nation, we have an uneasy relationship with the past. Among the latest standard-issue versions of the American dream is an updated iteration of the house in the suburbs, with a two-car garage, a ''country'' kitchen paved with floorboards resurrected from a local barn, a wireless audio system, flat-screen televisions and a cupola or a fan-light window or a gabled roof -- some quaint historical feature that quietly invokes an indeterminate era more gracious than our own. The past exists for us in old movies and scrapbooks, in ''vintage'' clothing and ''classic'' cars, in the sanitized restoration of selected landmarks. Meanwhile, the derelict buildings in our deserted inner cities are waiting to be torn down and replaced by the latest exercise in urban revitalization. It would never occur to us to put them in the same category as, say, the Colosseum. The Colosseum is a ''ruin,'' and ruins, to our minds, are picturesque and foreign, dignified by centuries -- venerated relics of some vanished civilization. But, as a handful of recent books attest, this definition is more convenient than it is useful.</p>

        <p>For all our war memorials and our golden-oldies radio, you could argue -- convincingly, I believe -- that as a nation, we have an uneasy relationship with the past. Among the latest standard-issue versions of the American dream is an updated iteration of the house in the suburbs, with a two-car garage, a ''country'' kitchen paved with floorboards resurrected from a local barn, a wireless audio system, flat-screen televisions and a cupola or a fan-light window or a gabled roof -- some quaint historical feature that quietly invokes an indeterminate era more gracious than our own. The past exists for us in old movies and scrapbooks, in ''vintage'' clothing and ''classic'' cars, in the sanitized restoration of selected landmarks. Meanwhile, the derelict buildings in our deserted inner cities are waiting to be torn down and replaced by the latest exercise in urban revitalization. It would never occur to us to put them in the same category as, say, the Colosseum. The Colosseum is a ''ruin,'' and ruins, to our minds, are picturesque and foreign, dignified by centuries -- venerated relics of some vanished civilization. But, as a handful of recent books attest, this definition is more convenient than it is useful.</p>
        <p>''American Ruins'' (the Monacelli Press) -- the title on first hearing sounds like an oxymoron -- challenged these notions in 1999, with an elegiac survey of decrepit architectural grandeur compiled by Camilo Jos√© Vergara, a photographer and essayist who is (it seems to me worth noting) Chilean. Examining his images, reading his lyrical account of the conditions he encountered, the reader can't help wondering whether the poetry inherent in these scenes of metropolitan entropy might not be more evident to someone raised in another culture. I think it's safe to say that few Americans by birth would recognize the beauty that Vergara finds in buildings routinely dismissed as eyesores. And yet, through his lens, we see it, too. In a section titled ''Accumulating Gloom: An Education,'' he explains: ''I am drawn to the themes of exile, lost wars, sickness, failure, decay, and death.'' (A dubious candidate for the life of the party, but a fascinating companion nonetheless.) ''These works move me sometimes to tears and fill my mind with images of great power and terrible loss,'' he continues, ''yet for all their sadness they also give me pleasure.''</p>
        <p>The buildings that Vergara cites are in most cases too expensive to restore and too expensive to tear down. They simply persist, neglected, colonized by a shadow population of hookers, drug addicts, artists and the homeless, forcing the forward march of urban renewal to take a detour and go around them. Some (the Book-Cadillac Hotel, the Packard Motors Plant, Michigan Central Railroad Station and the J.L. Hudson department store, all in Detroit) reappear in ''Ghostly Ruins: America's Forgotten Architecture,'' by Harry Skrdla (Princeton Architectural Press), published this fall. Skrdla and Vergara seem fixated on Detroit, for obvious reasons, but I, for one, wish that their research had taken them farther afield to any number of other second- and even third-tier American cities that could provide similar examples of magnificent decay.</p>
        <p>In addition to the overlaps, these books are testimony to certain styles and features that recur in these now-defunct architectural masterpieces. Corinthian columns, to cite one example, adorn any number of facades, from the Clinton Avenue Trust, in Newark, to the Berger Court, in the South Bronx, boldly deploying classical detail in an ambitious bid for legitimacy and (one imagines) as a pledge of allegiance to public-spirited ideals that hark back to ancient Greece. The impression of solidity and permanence that the Classical style usually confers seems faintly absurd in these instances, however, as we watch them succumb to the effects of time. Among the most striking of the sites is that of Windsor, a house built in 1861 for the owner of a cotton plantation in Port Gibson, Miss. Originally 25 rooms, the house burned to the ground in a fire more than a century ago. All that remains are 23 of the 28 columns with cast-iron Corinthian capitals that supported the portico on all sides. Skrdla shows them as they are today, delineating the house's perimeter and silhouetted against the sky, like some Dixie Acropolis.</p>
        <p>''Ghostly Ruins'' reprises many of Vergara's themes, but this time the author is a tour guide, herding us onto the bus, with a commentary that is chatty and sometimes glib. ''Perhaps the things you saw will leave a lingering impression,'' he writes in the afterword. ''Perhaps you may now regard them in a somewhat different light. ... After all, buildings are people too.''</p>
        <p>If that's the case, then New Orleans is now an architectural morgue. Two new books document the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, and both establish a whole new category of American ruins, on an unprecedented scale. In ''After the Flood,'' by Robert Polidori (Steidl Publishing), and ''In Katrina's Wake: Portraits of Loss From an Unnatural Disaster,'' by Chris Jordan (Princeton Architectural Press), we witness the devastation in lavish detail, and the poetic fascination is eclipsed by alarm and a sickening awareness of the damage's relentless extent. Wreckage fills the frame. The desolation is oppressive, overwhelming. The atmosphere of loss and nostalgia that pervades Vergara's and Skrdla's photographs of buildings that are forgotten but not gone descends here into grief and mourning for the everyday texture of lives that will never be rebuilt.</p>
        <p>Laissez les bons temps rouler. These images bear no relation to the gregarious, guidebook New Orleans, renowned for its brassy jazz and its Mardi Gras confetti. We make our way through these books without encountering a soul. Landscapes and still lifes depict a ghost town -- waterlogged, moldy, uninhabitable. Jordan's focus is on the flotsam of things that used to belong to someone -- the owners now dead or displaced, their possessions set adrift: marooned appliances, silent pianos, mud-caked hymnals, a chair suspended in a fence, a truck lying on its side like a beached whale. Polidori's subject is the buildings, on view in scenes of shipwrecked bungalows and frame houses reduced to piles of soggy kindling. For the interiors, he resorted to long exposures without the benefit of electric light, to record the vestiges of a domestic routine that's abruptly cut short.</p>
        <p>In picture after picture, the evidence accumulates, and the effect is inevitably political. In his introduction to ''After the Flood,'' Jeff L. Rosenheim contends that for Polidori, the ''primary cause'' of the catastrophe was ''idle negligence,'' not a Category 3 hurricane. In an essay that precedes Jordan's photographs, Bill McKibben argues that ''Katrina exposed not only the new physics of global warming but also the new chemistry of politics in our country.'' Public assistance and disaster relief have increasingly fallen to the private sector, as if these were voluntary gestures, a matter of conscience, a tax deduction, rather than our collective responsibility.</p>
        <p>These inventories of fallen monuments to our ambition as a nation -- some of them made obsolete over years of disuse, some rendered worthless overnight -- are unsettling for what they say about our culture. Taken all together, they signal the demise of the American empire. As Vergara and Skrdla fill us in on the circumstances behind each of their examples, we come to understand just how many of these buildings abandoned in our midst are the victims of our arrogance and our complacency. Ornate terminals for an extensive railway network that languished as we became more reliant on our cars, vast factories for manufacturing products now made overseas, public libraries and stately courthouses erected as temples to learning and justice in a mood of municipal largesse that has long since faded -- these shifts, under way for decades, created the conditions that made Hurricane Katrina possible: the global warming that heated the tides, a downsized government with inadequate resources to handle the crisis, the cavalier response of leaders voted into office on the basis of their not-my-brother's-keeper ideology.</p>
        <p>Europeans, who are more accustomed to living amid the evidence of prior civilizations, may do a better job of taking their ruins in stride. But for us, the forlorn buildings that these books describe take the measure of how far our society has fallen. They mar the landscape that tells us who we are and stand before us, a reproach and an indictment.</p>
