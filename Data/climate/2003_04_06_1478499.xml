        <p>I would like to reply to the reader who wrote a letter [March 30] in response to the article ''Using Solar Power With LIPA's Aid'' [March 16] that questioned the merits of a solar system I just installed on my home.</p>
        <p>First of all, solar photovoltaic systems are completely maintenance-free, with no moving parts to replace or repair. Once the system is installed, no further costs are incurred.</p>
        <p>Second, the reader stated that the system costs more than the money I will save on electric bills over the lifetime of the system. This is only true if you do not account for the rebate and tax incentives that reduced my out-of-pocket expenses to $6,000 from $22,500 (with estimated electricity cost savings in excess of $15,000), -- thanks to the terrific rebate LIPA is offering. The $5,000 per kilowatt rebate makes these photovoltaic systems more affordable by spurring growth in the marketplace that continues to drive prices down.</p>
        <p>Third, a solar photovoltaic system provides insurance against rising electric rates, which are inevitable in a volatile world market dependent upon finite fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>Finally, and perhaps most important, the majority of people who believe in and invest in renewable energy sources like solar power don't do it for payback or monetary gain. They do so because they value the societal benefits that solar power creates for our environment and public health, benefits that in my opinion you can't define with a price tag.</p>
