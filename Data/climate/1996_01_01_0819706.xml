        <p>They started the season at Notre Dame and ended the season at Jay Leno's. The Northwestern Wildcats are the Rose Bowl's latest pot luck dinner, and they hardly have game officials rushing to join the bowl alliance. The Wildcats are a fair-haired coach, a Heisman Trophy candidate, a five-headed secondary and a draw in Hollywood.</p>
        <p>They are 47 years in between Rose Bowls, two weeks in between snow storms and two minutes in between film sessions regarding Keyshawn Johnson. If, on New Year's Day, Northwestern can shut down Southern California's answer to Michael Irvin, it will officially turn a private, intimate Chicago-area institution into a football power.</p>
        <p>Our goal was not to get to the Rose Bowl," said their slim, motivator of a  coach, Gary Barnett. "It was to win the thing."</p>
        <p>Barnett is a jogger, story teller and vegetarian who clearly is on an ascending escalator. A 12-year Northwestern contract sits unsigned in his briefcase, but he may never take a pen to it. U.C.L.A. has a vacancy and wants to interview him five minutes after the Rose Bowl, and he must also have an interest in the pro game because he spent free mornings last spring at the Chicago Bears minicamp.</p>
        <p>For the moment, the only future Barnett will discuss is Monday's kickoff, when his No. 3-ranked Wildcats (10-1) attempt to stay true to their methodical formula against the Trojans (8-2-1).</p>
        <p>Northwestern has a plus-20 turnover ratio and has played keep-away from opponents all season. Its running back, the sophomore Darnell Autry, accrued at  least 100 yards in every game this year, fumbled only once and, remarkably, did  not even want to be in uniform just 12 months ago.</p>
        <p>Autry nearly transferred closer to his Arizona home after the 1994 season, but Barnett turned omnipotent on the running back: the coach would not release him from his scholarship. After 10 days of hiding out and soul-searching, Autry  ran a reverse, rejoined the program and wound up finishing fourth in the Heisman voting -- the best Northwestern finish since Otto Graham.</p>
        <p>U.S.C.'s Johnson, meanwhile, finished sixth in the voting, a victim of bias against wide receivers. He caught 90 passes in triple coverage, although Northwestern may dare to play him straight up. Its secondary is almost entirely  senior -- cornerbacks Rodney Ray and Chris Martin and free safety William Bennett are playing their final games -- and its best cover man could be the nickel back, Hudhaifa Ismaeli.</p>
        <p>"You just have to roll the dice a little bit," said Barnett, who sent his team out West two weeks early to escape the snow. "You can't overplay Keyshawn.  If you make him the focus, somebody else will get you."</p>
        <p>That somebody could be halfback Delon Washington or the Trojan quarterback platoon of Brad Otton and Kyle Wachholtz. It is anybody's guess, but that is precisely the malady at U.S.C.: too much mystery.</p>
        <p>Trojan Coach John Robinson has been criticized for rotating his quarterbacks, and, although he has the school back in the Rose Bowl for the first time since 1990, losses to Notre Dame and U.C.L.A. brought acid rain from alumni.</p>
        <p>"We've failed to beat our two main rivals," Robinson said, "so it's clear we  have more work to do."</p>
        <p>In fact, if Notre Dame is used as a compass, Northwestern should have its way in this Rose Bowl. U.S.C. was obliterated in October at South Bend, 38-10, whereas the Wildcats shocked the Irish, 17-15, back in early September.</p>
        <p>NBC took note of that and, finding a few empty seats on the Northwestern bandwagon, invited Barnett and the team on the "Tonight Show" Friday -- snubbing U.S.C. altogether.</p>
        <p>Barnett received raucous applause ("You and Colin Powell have gotten the two  biggest receptions," Leno told him) and the coach then told America about his infamous prediction of 1992.</p>
        <p>"Well, it was a basketball game at home," Barnett said, "and everyone started calling my name, and I got caught up in the moment, and I said, 'Let's take the  purple to Pasadena!'</p>
        <p>"Well, as I walked off, I heard several people ask me, 'What have you been smoking?' "</p>
        <p>Three years later, his record smokes for itself.</p>
