        <p>LEAD: A chemical used in many high-protection sun-blocking lotion sometimes causes allergic reactions, a new study indicates.</p>
        <p>A chemical used in many high-protection sun-blocking lotion sometimes causes allergic reactions, a new study indicates.</p>
        <p>The chemical, benzophenone, has been widely used as an alternative to PABA, another sunscreening chemical that had been known to cause allergic reactions in some users.</p>
        <p>Benzophenone caused allergic reactions in 4 patients out of 160 in a three-year study at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York. The reactions ranged from itchy rashes to blisters.</p>
        <p>The benzophenone absorbs both the burning and tanning rays of the sun. The initial benzophenone compound was developed in West Germany in the 1950's. The most common benzophenone compounds, oxybenzone and anthranilates, were rarely used by sunscreen manufacturers in the United States until the early 1980's, when allergic reactions to other sunscreen chemicals prompted the makers to diversify ingredients. Results Are Announced</p>
        <p>Reactions to sunscreens that contain PABA, or para-aminobenzoic acid, occur in about one user out of 10,000, said Dr. Leonard Harber, chairman of the dermatology department at Columbia-Presbyterian.</p>
        <p>He announced the new results this week at a meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology in Washington.</p>
        <p>''We saw a lot of allergic reactions to PABA about 10 years ago, when sunscreen manufacturers began using it to block ultraviolet B rays,'' Dr. Harber said. The ultraviolet B rays are the primary cause of sunburn.</p>
        <p>Dr. Harber said the reactions were not permanent, and usually went away within weeks when use of the sunscreen stopped. But sunscreen users often misdiagnose their reactions to the chemicals as a reaction to the sun, and aggravate the problem by using more, not less, sunscreen.</p>
        <p>Dr. Harber predicted that reactions to benzophenones would become more common since they are becoming more frequently used than PABA in sunscreens with sun protection factors greater than eight.</p>
        <p>''The only thing consumers can do when they're first testing a sun product is to test it on a small part of your body and protect the rest of your skin with clothing,'' Dr. Harber said. Some people react badly to the vehicle, or base, used in formalizing certain sunscreens, and should always test products before using them. Alternatives Are Available</p>
        <p>Dr. Harber said there are alternative products, such as titanium dioxide, for people with allergic reactions to PABA and benzophenones.</p>
        <p>''People should know that they should just keep looking for products they don't react to,'' he said.</p>
        <p>At the same conference, a researcher called for wider use of sunscreens to combat melanoma, a potentially fatal type of skin cancer that has been reported for many years to be rising sharply.</p>
        <p>Dr. Darrell S. Rigel, an assistant clinical professor of dermatology at New York University Medical School, noted Tuesday that diagnoses of melanoma had increased fifteen-fold since 1935 and that the disease now affected one in 128 Americans.</p>
        <p>In addition, more younger people are developing the cancer, he warned. ''Five years ago it was unusual to see someone under the age of 40 with skin cancer,'' Dr. Rigel said. ''Now we're commonly seeing people in their 20's with skin cancer.''</p>
        <p>Scientists believe that melanoma, like other less dangerous skin cancers, is promoted by heavy exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun, especially heavy burning.</p>
        <p>The depletion of the atmospheric ozone layer by pollutants will cause an increase in skin cancer because the ozone filters ultraviolet radiation. But the recent rise in the use of sunscreens, especially among children, could help reduce future skin cancer rates, Dr. Rigel said.</p>
        <p>He said the number of melanoma cases in the United States had almost doubled in the last eight years, and the number of deaths had tripled, to about 5,800, since 1960. Yet, the survival rate for patients with melanoma has risen from 60 percent in the 1960's, to about 83 percent today.</p>
