        <p>A PLAGUE</p>
        <p>OF FROGS</p>
        <p>The Horrifying True Story.</p>
        <p>By William Souder.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 299 pp. New York:</p>

        <p>We live in an age in which belief in the virtues of technology is ascendant, everyone and his dog wants to be a dot-com and greed is entertainment. Most of my college writing students have unalloyed faith in progress (although some of them don't know what ''unalloyed'' means). The roar of the S.U.V.'s can drown out challenges to the costs of technological advance.</p>
        <p>William Souder's immediate subject is deformed frogs, and if frogs had searched far and wide for a spokesman, they could have found no better. Souder, a Minnesota-based freelance journalist with a masterly understanding of science, manages to make frogs as interesting to the reader as they are to the scientists who study them, their mating habits, embryonic development, growth and yearly migrations. And there is a fascinating cast of these same researchers in ''A Plague of Frogs,'' the story of the ecological detective hunt that followed the discovery, by Cindy Reinitz, a schoolteacher, and a vanload of sixth, seventh and eighth graders, of severely distorted frogs in an innocuous pond on a farm in Minnesota in 1995.</p>
        <p>Some frogs, Souder recounts, had ''extra legs, singly and in pairs. Some of the additional legs were fairly normal-appearing duplicates growing alongside the primary limbs, others were translucent pink and undersized, sprouting at odd angles from the animals' hindquarters. There were fleshy masses and tapering, undifferentiated protrusions. . . . Some frogs had legs that appeared shrunken and desiccated and stiffened -- like jerky, as if they had been cooked to the bone. Others had legs that seemed to split in two . . . or legs that were weirdly bent and inflexible, with feet pointing every way but the right way.''</p>
        <p>The litany of limb disorders would become distressingly familiar in the next several years to the biologists Judy Helgen, of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, and Robert McKinnell and David Hoppe, of the University of Minnesota, as deformed frogs turned up in virtually every county of the largely rural state. Meanwhile, similarly afflicted amphibians were discovered in wetlands all along the Canadian border. Historically, there is evidence that amphibians are prone to such episodes. But the sheer numbers and percentages recorded in 1995 and after pointed to some human factor superimposing itself upon the natural pattern -- a signal, as Souder puts it, of something ''gone terribly wrong.'' Eventually, the Environmental Protection Agency got involved, as did the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the National Wildlife Health Center. Soon, academic experts on limb development, toxicology and other specialities joined the hunt.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the investigators were embroiled in intense disagreement. Souder shows us the messy deliberations, rivalries and politics of real science getting done. Were parasites the culprit? Or were hormone-mimicking breakdown products of pesticides interfering with normal development? Or maybe there was some pernicious interplay between the two? Souder, pursuing the story, sometimes -- justifiably -- found himself confused: ''The findings seemed to add up one minute and go to mush the next.'' Today, there is still no consensus.</p>
        <p>Souder could have told the story with more economy, but this is a quibble with what is otherwise a superb account of a disturbing environmental happening, which finally leaves us wondering, as scientists do, over its larger implications. Indeed, the frogs may be reacting to global warming and the increase in ultraviolet rays by becoming more susceptible to pathogens, to man-made poisons, to genetic miscues. Amphibian populations appear to be on the decline worldwide for some of these same reasons. ''The frogs are telling us a lot -- so much, perhaps, that we cannot yet fully understand the message,'' Souder writes. ''The earth is changing and the frogs are responding.''</p>
