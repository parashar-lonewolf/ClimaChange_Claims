        <p>Fifty years after its foundation was set in Rome as a trading bloc for six countries, the European Union marked a midlife milestone here on Sunday with all-night parties, a laid-back street festival and a fervent plea for renewal by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel.</p>
        <p>''Europe is much more than dairy cows and the Chemical Directive,'' said Mrs. Merkel, who holds the rotating presidency of the European Union and was host to the leaders of the 27 member countries at a gathering that included talks about climate change and the disaster in Darfur.</p>
        <p>''We must also renew the political shape of Europe in keeping with the times,'' Mrs. Merkel said, challenging the leaders to put Europe on a ''renewed common basis'' by 2009 -- a reference to its stalled Constitution. ''Not to do so,'' she warned, ''would be an historic failure.''</p>
        <p>While the refurbished monuments of this once sundered city served as testimony to Europe's achievements, the festivities were shadowed by a sense that the union is stuck in something like a midlife crisis -- unhappy about its divided present, uncertain about what path to take in the future.</p>
        <p>In a city that celebrated the World Cup last summer with joyful abandon, today's revelry seemed a bit dutiful.</p>
        <p>''We haven't heard much about this anniversary,'' said Maria Myszka, a 24-year-old law student from Poland who was here for a conference and had stumbled on the street fair at the Brandenburg Gate. ''You can't say that in Poland; we feel too connected to the E.U.''</p>
        <p>The prospects for a European Constitution seem murkier than ever -- so much so that it is not even mentioned in the Berlin Declaration, a statement signed Sunday that marks the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome, which created the former European Economic Community.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the declaration's 13 paragraphs can be read as a sort of Baedeker guide to the issues that divide Europeans these days. The euro got a nod, over the objections of Britain, one of the countries that never adopted the currency. Turkey's entry into Europe, which Mrs. Merkel and other leaders oppose, did not.</p>
        <p>Nor does the declaration mention Europe's Christian heritage, which Poland had sought and France resisted. That omission drew a rebuke from Pope Benedict XVI, who labeled it an ''apostasy.''</p>
        <p>But even he was less sweeping in his criticism than the Czech president, Vaclav Klaus, who complained in a German radio interview that he had only 24 hours to read over the text. ''A democratic debate is lacking,'' said Mr. Klaus, a skeptic about European integration.</p>
        <p>Still, the cavils over wording did not diminish the rich symbolism of a German leader like Mrs. Merkel, raised in the Communist east, presiding over the celebration of a quintessentially Western European institution.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Merkel remarked that just west of the German Historical Museum, where the declaration was signed, the Berlin Wall once cut off the east from west. As a young woman in East Berlin, she said, that ''was the point where any walk I took would be at an end.'' The fall of the wall, she said, brought home to her that ''nothing ever has to stay the way it is.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Merkel expressed solidarity with the people of a former Soviet state and nonmember, Belarus, whom she described as Europeans still enduring oppression.</p>
        <p>She also demanded that Sudan comply with United Nations resolutions on its treatment of refugees in the Darfur region, or face tougher sanctions -- a warning echoed by Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain.</p>
        <p>Finding consensus on Darfur, however, may be easier than on problems closer to home. With the Constitution stalled and with Turkey's application for membership facing rising resistance, the only major issue around which Europeans have been able to rally is climate change.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, the 27 nations pledged to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by up to 30 percent from 1990 levels by 2020, as well as to generate 20 percent of their energy from renewable sources.</p>
        <p>''It's certainly not enough'' as an initiative, ''but you've got to stick to the areas where Europe can act,'' said Daniel Gros, director of the Center for European Policy Studies, in Brussels.</p>
        <p>On a sun-kissed weekend, Berliners seemed game for a party, whatever the occasion. They strolled past tents where people served European specialties like crepes, sausages and mugs of Guinness.</p>
        <p>On Saturday night, 35 clubs threw open their doors to bands from around Europe, and museums stayed open until 2 a.m. A Greek Byzantine choir sang on the steps of the Great Altar of Pergamon, depicting Greek gods, kings and warriors, at the Pergamon Museum, while a troupe of players performed outside the recently renovated Bode Museum.</p>
        <p>''Sure, the E.U. matters,'' said Thomas Leicht, a doctor from Munich, as he took in the show. ''You can see the terrible history of Europe in this city. The E.U. is the reason it will never happen again.''</p>
