        <p>CON EDISON has been feeling the heat -- or at least I hope it has. Recent reports by the state's Public Service Commission have faulted the utility for the breakdown of numerous feeder cables during the power failure last summer in Queens and for not preparing and mobilizing quickly enough when powerful windstorms hit Westchester County in July and September.</p>
        <p>The Westchester cases, in which tens of thousands of customers lost electricity, some for more than three days, were primarily a communications and staffing problem that, while serious, should be easy for officials to resolve. The Queens blackout, which left 174,000 customers without power, some for as long as nine days, is more serious.</p>
        <p>The power company, in its defense, said that the failure of the feeder cables in Queens was beyond its control. But this is what it said in 1999, when faulty lines in Washington Heights left 200,000 in the dark; in June 1961, when 400,000 people lost power in Manhattan because of a faulty circuit breaker; and in August 1959, when 500,000 people were cut off because of feeder cable malfunctions. In each case, Con Edison said it regretted the inconvenience to customers but that the failures really were beyond its control.</p>
        <p>But this explanation doesn't work. Con Ed should have known better. The state agency's report asserted that Con Edison failed to meet reliability and performance standards, especially when, at the height of last July's breakdown, the utility knew less than it said and consequently did less than it could to reduce the extent of the power failure. Furthermore, plentiful evidence pointed to the poor performance of the Queens feeder cables over the previous several years. Con Edison, whose motto used to be ''Dig We Must,'' ought to know its own underground wires by now.</p>
        <p>A steep fine might well be justified in the case of the Queens and Westchester failures, but state authorities should go further than mere admonition. There is more to electricity than wires. The Public Service Commission should aim not just to improve local electric service but to improve consumers' awareness of their electric use, particularly if this leads to a drop in consumption, with a corresponding drop in the need for new power plants. Europeans enjoy practically the same quality of life as Americans but require only half the electricity to get it. Several things can and should be done.</p>
        <p>APPLIANCES -- New York, to its credit, is one of the few states that has energy efficiency standards for appliances. Yet these standards should be tightened. The history of improved appliances -- refrigerators and light bulbs can now deliver the same service with only one-fourth the power used 30 years earlier -- shows that moves to increase efficiency almost always pay for themselves in energy savings.</p>
        <p>METERING -- Utilities, like Con Edison, should do more than issue pamphlets with the monthly bill about how to conserve electricity. They can back up their helpful tips with price breaks for prudent energy use, especially during peak-demand hours. This prudence could be driven home by the use of real-time metering, a process by which one can see instantaneously (perhaps by e-mail message) what the momentary cost of power is.</p>
        <p>For example, if you knew that at 5 p.m. you would be charged 40 cents per kilowatt-hour but only 5 cents at 11 p.m., you might wait to run the dishwasher. This would lessen the need for what are known as peaking plants, expensive generators that deliver power only a few hours a day during peak demand. State authorities should insist that such meters be put into use, at least on a wider test basis, as is being done in Illinois.</p>
        <p>EMISSIONS -- Moreover, New York State, like California, could impose limits or assessments on the greenhouse gases spewed into the air by power plants. State action would help freshen the air and encourage legislators in Washington to adopt a more comprehensive policy. Electricity producers are not thrilled by these levies, but are already coming to view them as a cost of doing business, not so much a carbon tax as a user's fee.</p>
        <p>The Con Edison service area includes nine million people, six million air-conditioners, four million recharging cellphones and eight million televisions. Sure, Con Ed could -- and should -- do more to keep the sprawl of underground power lines that energize the city humming with electricity. But so too should officials in Albany and in Washington.</p>
        <p>And let's not leave out consumers. There's a lot they can do, like install energy-efficient fluorescent bulbs, add insulation to their homes and moderate their use of thermostats.</p>
        <p>New York's snow will be melting soon and before you know it we'll be back to air-conditioner weather, when the electrical grid is taxed to its maximum. To lessen the threat of blackouts, the power company, government and customers can all help to shape our common electrical environment and culture.</p>
