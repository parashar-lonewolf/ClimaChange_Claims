        <p>A three-ring circus and a temple of high art; a community development project and a political forum; a multipurpose theme park with oases for sports fans and children and a star-packed movie premiere -- this is the sixth annual Tribeca Film Festival, which begins on Wednesday and continues for 12 days around the city.</p>
        <p>So much is happening that Tribeca's substance as a serious, sweeping survey of world cinema might be obscured by the glamour and fun.

        <p>A three-ring circus and a temple of high art; a community development project and a political forum; a multipurpose theme park with oases for sports fans and children and a star-packed movie premiere -- this is the sixth annual Tribeca Film Festival, which begins on Wednesday and continues for 12 days around the city.</p>
        <p>So much is happening that Tribeca's substance as a serious, sweeping survey of world cinema might be obscured by the glamour and fun. More than any other American film festival it operates from the premise that the movies wouldn't be the movies without some Barnum &amp; Bailey razzle-dazzle and Hollywood tinsel. Think of it as the annual spring film festival that eats New York.</p>
        <p>If the sprawl is intimidating, Tribeca isn't running wild. There are fewer films this year than last, and a New York category has been eliminated. Still, the statistics are daunting: 157 feature films and 88 shorts from 47 countries and territories. In the competition 18 films will vie for best narrative feature and 16 for best documentary feature.</p>
        <p>There are grand openings: the United States premiere of ''Spider-Man 3'' on April 30; the world premiere of Curtis Hanson's romantic drama ''Lucky You'' on May 1; and on the closing night another world premiere: ''The Gates,'' Antonio Ferrera and Albert Maysles's HBO documentary about Christo and Jean-Claude's 2005 Central Park installation.</p>
        <p>It all begins with a gala -- Al Gore is the host -- that introduces the SOS Short Films Program. Consisting of seven movies about global warming, each directed by a different filmmaker, the program includes contributions by Jonathan Glazer (''Sexy Beast''), Kevin Macdonald (''The Last King of Scotland''), Abel Ferrara (''King of New York''), Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady (''Jesus Camp''), Aardman Animation (''Wallace and Gromit''), Amy Berg (''Deliver Us From Evil'') and Ari Sandel (''West Bank Story''). Like last year's opening salvo, the premiere of ''United 93,'' this year's pointedly addresses controversy and current events. The festival was born out of the ashes of 9/11 to help revitalize the devastated economy of Lower Manhattan, and its focus on issues makes it an exception among film festivals. This year there are a plethora of films dealing with the Middle East and the war in Iraq.</p>
        <p>Business may have returned to the area, Jane Rosenthal, a co-producer of the festival with Robert De Niro and Craig Hatkoff, said the other day. ''But we're still living with a pit.''</p>
        <p>The festival's concept of community development involves more than attracting business to Lower Manhattan. It wants to lure the broad moviegoing audience beyond multiplex fare. The bells and whistles ballyhoo -- including a family movie series, a sports film series and a drive-in movie -- is bait.</p>
        <p>Having seen some 30 of the films to be shown, many in the competitive categories, I can attest that the festival's artistic level is well above average, although some categories are spottier than others. The films in the Spotlight section (movies with stars, established directors and serious subject matter) and the Showcase section (movies that have earned praise at other festivals) are generally more consistent than the fare in the Discover section (movies by first- and second-time directors).</p>
        <p>As a showcase Tribeca may never match the Cannes Film Festival, which Peter Scarlet, Tribeca's executive director and chief programmer, described as ''a 200-pound gorilla.'' But the absence of the international A-list directors who regularly take their work to Cannes allows more room for lesser-known international talents. In its commitment to world cinema, it's way ahead of the Sundance Film Festival. Eastern Europe and Asia have been particularly fruitful sources of challenging Tribeca Festival films. In any case much of the best of Cannes, which takes place next month, can be seen this fall at the New York Film Festival.</p>
        <p>Given its roots it is fitting that Tribeca is particularly strong on documentaries, a proliferating genre you might call reality television with a conscience. Last year it distinguished itself with ''The War Tapes,'' ''Jesus Camp'' and ''Jonestown: The Life and Death of the People's Temple.'' This year two films likely to generate serious debate, ''I Am an American Soldier: One Year in Iraq With the 101st Airborne'' and ''Taxi to the Dark Side,'' offer quietly devastating examinations of, respectively, the training of soldiers and the treatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo.</p>
        <p>''American Soldier,'' directed by John Laurence, follows an elite division for 14 months, from the United States to Samara and Sadr City and then home. By turns moving and appalling, it offers a picture of the best American soldiers as a tightly bonded band of brothers. At the same time it observes how these soldiers are trained to objectify the enemy, or anyone who might be confused with the enemy, as less than human. It's a movie about patriotic servicemen and servicewomen given official license to kill innocent civilians by their superiors; what makes it all the sadder is that the soldiers are such likable people.</p>
        <p>''Taxi to the Dark Side,'' Alex Gibney's follow-up to ''Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room,'' is a meticulous examination of American policy on the interrogation of prisoners. It traces the scandals at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere to official changes of policy originating in the vice president's office and approved by the secretary of defense. We see documents listing approved methods of interrogation, including waterboarding, which simulates drowning. The film also examines the C.I.A.'s history of research into interrogation techniques, including sense deprivation, as ways to ''break'' a subject.</p>
        <p>Beth Murphy's ''Beyond Belief'' follows two women whose husbands died in 9/11 on a journey to Kabul to help Afghan widows, whose lives are so miserable that the visitors feel grateful for what they have, despite their loss.</p>
        <p>If many of the films vying for best narrative feature are equally serious, their fingers are not pressed on hot buttons. High on the list of contenders is ''Lady Chatterley,'' the French filmmaker Pascale Ferran's screen realization of the D. H. Lawrence novel about the sensual awakening of a repressed, aristocratic woman with a disabled husband. The 168-minute film, which won five Césars (the French Oscars) including best film and best actress, is a rapturous visual tone poem in which the images of the forest where Constance Chatterley (Marina Hands) romps with Oliver Parkin (Jean-Louis Couloc'h), the rough-hewn gamekeeper on her estate, and the couple's lovemaking converge in a pantheistic delirium.</p>
        <p>Patrice Leconte's ''My Best Friend,'' not in the competition, is a smart, acidic French comedy about the meaning of friendship in which a successful art dealer, realizing he has no close friends, hires a garrulous taxi driver to teach him sociability. He is a slow learner.</p>
        <p>The Turkish film ''Times and Winds'' (''Bas Vakit'') examines the harsh life in a remote mountain village through the eyes of three children. As in ''Lady Chatterley,'' nature is an overwhelming presence in the film, which belongs to the same school of primal humanism as the movies of Satyajit Ray and Abbas Kiarostami, although its edges are harder. Bitter father-son strife, passed down through generations, is a cruel subtext. The music of the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt wafts through the film likea dry mountain breeze.</p>
        <p>''Times and Winds'' is typical of the majority of serious films in its toughness and absence of sentimentality. In Antonio Negret's ''Towards Darkness,'' a grim story of kidnapping set in Colombia, America Ferrera does a 180-degree turn from her endearing alter ego in ''Ugly Betty.'' In Shane Meadows's ''This Is England,'' set in 1983, an 11-year-old boy who has lost his father is adopted by a gang of racist skinheads; the movie feels more authentic than many documentaries.</p>
        <p>In the Hungarian director Gyorgy Palfi's surreal ''Taxidermia,'' grossly obese men indulge in speed eating contests, then vomit what they've ingested; in the film's nauseated vision, the human body is a monstrosity to be stuffed and mounted. Leading off the five short stories in ''The Optimists,'' by the Serbian director Goran Paskaljevic, is a tale of a town devastated by a natural disaster whose residents clamor to be hypnotized into happiness by a lunatic. In the final story a busload of terminally ill patients who invested their faith and money in a con man go on a rollicking journey to a healing hot spring that lands them in a muddy pit.</p>
        <p>The festival's most intriguing special event is Paolo Cherchi Usai's 74-minute silent film, ''Passio.'' Synchronized with Arvo Pärt's majestic 1982 oratorio, which will be performed live by the Trinity Choir, the film will have three screenings at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, on April 27 and 28, and a fourth at Trinity Church on April 29.</p>
        <p>''The hardest-hitting, cruelest, most affecting collection of sound and image this side of Buñuel'' is how Linda Williams, a film scholar at the University of California, Berkeley, described this assemblage of found images of human suffering and scientific experimentation in the journal Film Quarterly. Images, which Mr. Usai calls ''countless manifestations of our neglected or repressed collective memory,'' are coordinated with Mr. Pärt's stark, minimalist score so that the music seems to conjure the pictures rather than simply illustrating them.</p>
        <p>From an entirely different musical wellspring is ''Rebirth of a Nation,'' DJ Spooky's eerie, unsettling video ''remix'' of D. W. Griffith's ''Birth of a Nation,'' with a hip-hop soundtrack that underscores the movie's crude racist stereotypes. Its creator, also known as Paul D. Miller, has described his work as making a film he finds offensive ''fall in on itself.'' It will be shown at the Winter Garden on May 4 and 5.</p>
        <p>But all is not doom and gloom. The festival includes an unusual number of music documentaries, from an upbeat tribute to the jazz singer Anita O'Day to the even more upbeat ''Autism: The Musical,'' in which five autistic children from Los Angeles write and rehearse a musical comedy; ''Chops,'' about a high school jazz-band competition; ''Planet B-Boy,'' about the global resurgence of break dancing; and ''Pete Seeger: The Power of Song,'' which looks at the life and contribution of the great folk singer.</p>
        <p>Despite all the grief, suffering, strife and despair on view, there is still a song to sing.</p>
