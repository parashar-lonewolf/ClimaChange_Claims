        <p>LEAD: Amid tooting tugboats, the Exxon Valdez eased into port today for repairs, completing a journey from Alaska, where she caused the nation's worst oil spill last March 24.</p>
        <p>Amid tooting tugboats, the Exxon Valdez eased into port today for repairs, completing a journey from Alaska, where she caused the nation's worst oil spill last March 24.</p>
        <p>For the last 10 miles today, the tanker crept under her own power at about three knots. Three weeks ago her docking was delayed after the discovery of seven large steel plates hanging loose from her flat bottom and of a light 18-mile slick around her.</p>
        <p>Repairs at the National Steel and Shipbuilding Company, where the Exxon Valdez was built in 1986, were expected to take at least nine months and cost $25 million or more, providing employment for about 300 shipyard workers. Relieved, Exxon Chief Says</p>
        <p>''We're happy, elated, relieved,'' said Frank Iarossi, the president of the Exxon Shipping Company, part of the Exxon Corporation, which owns the vessel. ''It's taken us four months to get it back here. We've done it safely. We've done it carefully.'' Work was to begin this week with a new inspection of the hull, followed when the tide is right in about two weeks by a transfer to a repair dock, where about 30 percent of the hull is expected to be replaced.</p>
        <p>Extensive precautions were taken today as she entered San Diego harbor escorted by more than a dozen official vessels and a small swarm of helicopters.</p>
        <p>''We didn't want another surprise like we had three weeks ago,'' said T. W. Gillette, external affairs adviser of Exxon Shipping. He said the hanging plates and 8 to 10 other pieces of the hull were cut off by divers. Harbor in Joyous Greeting</p>
        <p>Pleasure boats and eight craft representing the environmental group Greenpeace darted about the edges of a 300-yard ''safety zone'' established around the perimeter of the Exxon Valdez by the Coast Guard.</p>
        <p>Aboard one Greenpeace vessel a spokesman, Kelly Quirke, said: ''We want to draw attention to the fact the tanker represents a fossil-fuel energy policy that not only destroys the oceans with oil spills but also destroys the atmosphere with the greenhouse effect.''</p>
        <p>Various tests have produced slightly differing analyses of the slick discovered three weeks ago that, along with the loose plates, forced cancellation of a docking here July 11.</p>
        <p>A Coast Guard laboratory concluded that a fluid substance that had appeared on the surface around the vessel was plankton and other micro-organic compounds mixed with traces of weathered and degraded Alaska North Slope crude oil.</p>
        <p>Once the vessel is again seaworthy, Mr. Iarossi said, the company is considering changing her name so she can ''restart a new career.''</p>
