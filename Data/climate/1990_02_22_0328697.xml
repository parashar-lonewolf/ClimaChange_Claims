        <p>It would make the beginning of a science fiction story. A world congress of biologists meeting in Canterbury, England, last September found on comparing notes that frogs are disappearing from ponds, swamps, creeks and rain forests all over the world. Are the vanishing amphibians signaling an invisible peril for humans, like canaries in a mine?</p>
        <p>That depends on whether global or local causes are making the frogs croak. A National Academy of Sciences committee is reviewing the evidence, but so far only the first chapter of the mystery has been written. At a meeting in Irvine, Calif., this week, the committee heard all sorts of theories but no solution, Sandra Blakeslee reports in The Times.</p>
        <p>Certainly some frog populations have perished from special causes, like the tara humare frog of Arizona, killed by pollution from copper mines, and the Twain-fabled jumping frog of Calaveras County, consumed by imported bullfrogs. Cattle egrets gobble up frogs in Texas, raccoons dine on them in Connecticut. Frogs expire on laboratory benches in America and in gourmets' kitchens in France; which nation derives the greater benefit is a debate for philosophers. But even in some pristine areas of the world, safe from humans and local pollution, frog populations are also in decline, maybe indicating larger causes at work.</p>
        <p>Some biologists suggest a greater flux of ultraviolet rays from the sun, admitted because of a thinning of the ozone layer. Some propose acid rain. Some point to windborne pesticides. If any such cause is responsible, the frogs will be serving as valuable sentinels of impending damage to humans.</p>
        <p>The biologists meeting at Irvine could find no global reason for the dearth of frogs. But they agreed frogs may be particularly sensitive to pollution, since they inhabit earth, air and water. The decline is far from universal: frogs are still flourishing in many places. Animal behavior can be hard to interpret: the stampeding of pigs may presage earthquakes, but the scores of dead dolphins recently washed up on the Atlantic shore turned out to have died of a bacterial toxin and not, as expected, because of widespread water pollution.</p>
        <p>''Brekekekex koax koax,'' screamed the chorus of ancient Greek frogs in Aristophanes' play titled for them, while Dionysos rowed across the river of the underworld. Their words were just gibberish, but the frogs' sudden deathly silence may hold a greater meaning.</p>
