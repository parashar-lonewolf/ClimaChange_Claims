        <p>THE ROAD, by Cormac McCarthy. (Vintage International, $14.95.) In this Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, a man and his young son travel across the wretched landscape of a post-apocalyptic world. A nuclear holocaust has reduced everything to ash -- clocks stopped at 1:17; the sky opened with ''a long shear of light and then a series of low concussions'' -- and the survivors must kill or be killed (and eaten). As winter approaches, McCarthy's unnamed heroes scavenge their way south to the Gulf Coast, encountering all manner of perils and remnants of the lost world. In the Book Review, William Kennedy called this terrifying parable ''consistently brilliant in its imagining of the posthumous condition of nature and civilization.''</p>
        <p>THE SHIA REVIVAL: How Conflicts Within Islam Will Shape the Future, by Vali Nasr. (Norton, $14.95.) A timely history of the age-old split between Islam's two major sects -- the majority Sunnis and minority Shiites -- ''The Shia Revival'' argues that Operation Iraqi Freedom has created a Middle East shaped less by the ideal of democracy than by political and theological wars within Islam.</p>
        <p>THE MAN OF MY DREAMS, by Curtis Sittenfeld. (Random House, $13.95.) Like her predecessor in ''Prep,'' Hannah, the protagonist of Sittenfeld's incisive second novel, is a lonely outsider who casts a critical eye on her peers. The novel follows Hannah through the various stations of her self-conscious, doubt-racked life -- parents' divorce, college, first job -- dissecting her turbulent relationships with men.</p>
        <p>AVA GARDNER: ''Love Is Nothing,'' by Lee Server. (St. Martin's Griffin, $17.95.) ''Hers was the old rags-to-riches story,'' Server writes in his richly entertaining biography of Ava Gardner (1922-90), ''a Cinderella rewrite, the barefoot country girl who became a reluctant movie queen.'' Server chronicles Gardner's highs and lows: her poor though happy childhood in rural North Carolina; the mainly disappointing films she was forced to make under the old studio star system; and her tempestuous marriages to Mickey Rooney, Artie Shaw and Frank Sinatra. Our reviewer, Peter Bogdanovich, called this biography ''enthralling'': ''In the space of these pages, we befriend, then fall in love with, then finally mourn a remarkably beautiful woman who was surprisingly shy, yet spoke her mind fearlessly (and often colorfully), who thought little of herself as an actress, who lived in a man's world yet managed not to be fooled into losing sight of who she was.''</p>
        <p>SHE MAY NOT LEAVE, by Fay Weldon. (Grove, $13.) Weldon turns her acerbic eye to the desperate neediness of Martyn and Hattie, two-career Londoners; their 6-month-old daughter, Kitty; and their Polish nanny, Agnieszka Wyszynska, who appears to be better at parenting than the parents themselves.</p>
        <p>POWER AND THE IDEALISTS: Or, The Passion of Joschka Fischer, and Its Aftermath, by Paul Berman. (Norton, $14.95.) Berman, the author of ''A Tale of Two Utopias'' and ''Terror and Liberalism,'' examines the legacy of the New Left in Europe since 1968 and the intellectual journey of Joschka Fischer, a onetime radical who became Germany's foreign minister and most admired politician.</p>
        <p>THE SECRET RIVER, by Kate Grenville. (Canongate, $14.) A Booker Prize finalist last year, this unflinching novel -- loosely based on Grenville's family history -- explores modern Australia's origins through the tale of William Thornhill, a Thames boatman and petty thief who is banished with his wife to New South Wales in 1806.</p>
        <p>BIG COAL: The Dirty Secret Behind America's Energy Future, by Jeff Goodell. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $14.95.) Coal, Goodell argues in this critique of one of the country's biggest, most powerful and most antiquated industries, is bad for the economy, bad for public health and especially bad for the environment. ''But we've been hooked on coal for almost 150 years now,'' he writes, ''and like a Bowery junkie, we keep telling ourselves it's time to come clean, without ever actually doing it.'' Goodell considers coal at three points in its life cycle: its mining, its transformation into electricity and its role in climate change.</p>
        <p>READING LIKE A WRITER: A Guide for People Who Love Books and for Those Who Want to Write Them, by Francine Prose. (Harper Perennial, $13.95.) Prose, who brilliantly satirized creative-writing workshops in her novel ''Blue Angel,'' explains how close reading -- savoring books rather than racing through them -- informs good writing. ''Reading Like a Writer'' singles out excerpts from Prose's favorite writers and includes a list of 117 ''Books to Be Read Immediately.'' A MIRROR IN THE ROADWAY: Literature and the Real World, by Morris Dickstein. (Princeton University, $16.95.) Beginning with how writers like Whitman, Melville and Wharton described life in New York, Dickstein, in 20 lucid essays, celebrates the enduring power of the novel, providing biographical portraits of a diverse group of writers and their cultural moments.</p>
