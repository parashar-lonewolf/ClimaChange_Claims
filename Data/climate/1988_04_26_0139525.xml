        <p>LEAD: LASERS, which have become nearly as common as guns in modern armies, are making battlefields so dangerous for friends as well as foes that arms makers are racing to devise new shields against them.</p>
        <p>LASERS, which have become nearly as common as guns in modern armies, are making battlefields so dangerous for friends as well as foes that arms makers are racing to devise new shields against them.</p>
        <p>Unlike the powerful lasers envisioned as antimissile weapons for the Reagan Administration's Strategic Defense Initiative, battlefield lasers developed during and since the Vietnam War are relatively cheap and are produced in great numbers.</p>
        <p>A Pentagon expert estimated in an interview that the Soviet army is using ''tens of thousands'' of battlefield lasers of various kinds. American ground, air and naval forces also depend heavily on lasers, including a portable range finder and target homing device called a Ground/Vehicle Laser Locator Designator.</p>
        <p>The lasers are not intended primarily as weapons; they are not capable of shooting down missiles or airplanes. Instead they are used to find concealed enemy positions, to determine the distances and directions of targets and to illuminate targets with laser energy that, when reflected by a designated target, serves as a homing beacon for robotically steered bombs, shells and missiles.</p>
        <p>Despite the relatively low power of the lasers, they are capable of devastating the vision devices and tracking equipment essential to the latest tanks, warships and aircraft. Some can also dazzle and even blind human beings by burning out retinas, clouding corneas or otherwise damaging the eye.</p>
        <p>As a sign of the times, the United States Army has ordered 100,000 pairs of plastic anti-laser goggles for infantry soldiers, a senior Army commander disclosed in an interview. The goggles are designed to block two common wavelengths of laser light: visible red light and invisible infrared radiation.</p>
        <p>Some American officials, including Senator Malcolm Wallop, Republican of Wyoming, have accused the Soviet Union of deliberately trying to blind American pilots with lasers. In one incident last October, American aircraft tracking a Soviet missile test in the South Pacific were ''illuminated by an intense light'' from a Soviet ship in the vicinity, according to the Pentagon. The co-pilot of one of the airplanes suffered ''disturbed'' vision for about 10 minutes before recovering.</p>
        <p>Brig. Gen. Malcolm R. O'Neill, commander of the United States Army Laboratory Command, said in an interview that he knew of similar incidents involving military aircraft of the United States, Britain and Sweden, all of which he said had been harrassed by Soviet lasers.</p>
        <p>''We can't say whether they were trying to blind our pilots, chase off our aircraft, or merely track our planes as potential missile targets,'' he said. ''But whatever the case, those lasers create problems for pilots.''</p>
        <p>Whether lasers are being produced in the Soviet Union for the express purpose of blinding personnel remains an open question, but American experts believe such weapons are inevitable, though repugnant. 'Blindness and Not Death'</p>
        <p>But in an article in the magazine Army, Maj. Clark P. Campbell and Capt. Frederick L. Borch 3d defended the weapons.</p>
        <p>''The argument that a laser weapon used solely as an antipersonnel weapon causes unnecessary suffering is not convincing,'' they wrote. ''Blindness is a totally incapacitating injury for a soldier on the modern battlefield; hence, the value of a laser weapon would be great.</p>
        <p>''Furthermore, as blindness and not death is the result, it may be argued that the weapon is actually more humane.''</p>
        <p>Army officials note that even inside tanks, soldiers' eyes are vulnerable to lasers. Although tank crews use a variety of infrared- and visible-light vision devices, they also view battlefields through armor glass vision ports and periscopes, which afford wider fields of view than do electronic devices. Visible lasers pass right through glass windows, lenses and prisms, depositing all their devastating energy inside the eyeball.</p>
        <p>''It is entirely possible to build a high-powered laser capable of scanning an entire front and thereby blinding anyone who looks toward the weapon,'' General O'Neill said.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the lower-powered laser range finders and target designators already in common use could have crippling effects on tanks and artillery, if the air over the battlefield were reasonably free of smoke, cloud and dust. The advanced vision and targeting equipment on American combat vehicles, ships and aircraft would probably be particularly vulnerable, experts say. Night-Vision Devices</p>
        <p>Since the 1950's, many tanks built throughout the world have been equipped with ''active'' night-vision devices in which infrared searchlights provide the illumination. The searchlight sends a beam of invisible infrared radiation to a target, and lens systems aboard the tank focus the infrared light reflected by the target on an electronic tube. The tube converts the infrared pattern into a visible image that can be used by a tank driver to maneuver in darkness or by a gunner to shoot at an otherwise invisible target.</p>
        <p>The system is effective, but today's armies are equipped with devices with which an infrared searchlight can be instantly detected and fired on.</p>
        <p>American forces have therefore developed ''passive'' night-vision devices that require no artificial illumination. Because they are difficult for an enemy to detect, passive devices are vastly more effective than infrared searchlights, but they have one potentially fatal weakness: they can be wrecked by lasers.</p>
        <p>Passive equipment works by detecting the faint infrared radiation naturally emitted by almost all objects. By measuring the slight difference in infrared radiation given off by a cool forest and a warm human being, for example, such a device can construct a visible image of the person, even in total darkness.</p>
        <p>American gunners and tank crews are relying increasingly on passive vision devices even in daylight, because the equipment can ''see'' through clouds of dust and smoke thrown up by cannon fire. Vulnerable Sensors</p>
        <p>Passive infrared vision devices and gunsights depend upon cryogenic detectors that must be chilled to minus 320 degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature of liquid nitrogen. Arms builders have developed cryogenic refrigerators so small they are can be built into the sights themselves.</p>
        <p>But the cryogenic sensors can be destroyed by lasers of even moderate energy, a fact that has not been lost on Soviet military designers. Although Soviet forces are reported to be using some passive vision equipment, most Soviet tanks are believed to lack the devices.</p>
        <p>Lasers of moderate power can be destructive in other ways. One system tested by American designers scans a low-powered laser over a battlefield looking for concealed enemy observers. When the laser encounters such optical elements as the prisms in binoculars, a characteristic reflection is returned to the searcher. If the user believes the reflection to be coming from an enemy observer or gun position, he can turn up the power, thereby either blinding the enemy or heating the nitrogen gas sealed inside the opponent's binoculars or sighting device, causing it to blow apart.</p>
        <p>Lasers have also been tested against transparent aircraft cockpit canopies and vehicle windshields, causing enough damage to render the targets opaque. Power and Wavelength</p>
        <p>The damage or injury a laser can cause depends primarily on two variables: power and wavelength.</p>
        <p>According to an official at the National Bureau of Standards, lasers that produce visible light are likely to do the most damage to the retina. Lasers in the infrared range are ordinarily blocked by the cornea, and hence are unlikely to hurt the retina. But if an infrared laser is sufficiently powerful, it effectively cooks the cornea causing the transparent protein of the tissue to become opaque.</p>
        <p>To avoid accidents using infrared target-designator lasers, General O'Neill said, the Army keeps troops well out of the way when such devices are used during exercises.</p>
        <p>But various Army and Air Force weapons, including the Hellfire antitank missile, depend on laser designators to find their targets. In combat, it might prove virtually impossible to segregate troops from ''friendly'' lasers.</p>
        <p>With this in mind, the anti-laser goggles will soon come into general use, but even these can be defeated. The goggles are designed to block only one or two narrow bands of wavelengths, those that a soldier is likeliest to encounter. Most lasers operate at single wavelengths that can be anticipated in designing protective equipment.</p>
        <p>But one class of lasers, the tunable dye lasers, can emit a broad range of different wavelengths, any one of which could be selected in the heat of combat. For goggles to assure protection against all possible wavelengths, the lenses would have to block virtually all light and would therefore be useless. Although dye lasers are generally much less powerful than other kinds, development of high-power tunable lasers using dyes or free-electron energy pumps is an objective of both Soviet and American research.</p>
        <p>Military laboratories have experimented with crystals that become opaque when illuminated by intense light. Airmen who may see the flash of a nuclear explosion are issued eye protectors containing crystals of a transparent material that can block the light almost instantly. But even this fast-reacting material is not fast enough for some lasers. ''By the time the stuff goes opaque the laser has already blinded you,'' an expert said. Classes of Lasers</p>
        <p>Many visible lasers are dangerous even at low powers.</p>
        <p>The lowest-power lasers, designated by environmental health agencies as Class I, are those with power up to half of one microwatt. Typically used as bar-code readers in supermarket checkout counters and in compact disk players, these lasers can shine directly into the eye without causing damage.</p>
        <p>Class II lasers, from half of one microwatt to one milliwatt, used as lecture pointers and for laboratory demonstrations, are dangerous only to someone who stares directly at them for longer than one-quarter second. Ordinarily, experts say, the ''aversion reflex'' forces a person to blink or turn his eyes away from a Class II laser in time enough to prevent damage. This may not be true, however, for someone intoxicated by alcohol or drugs.</p>
        <p>Class III lasers, from 1 to 500 milliwatts, can damage the eye in less time than it takes to blink. These lasers are typically used to align the foundations of buildings.</p>
        <p>Class IV lasers, all lasers with more than one half watt of power, not only damage eyes but can burn skin, cloth and other materials. Carbon dioxide Class IV lasers up to 50,000 watts in power are used to cut steel plates and massive metal objects.</p>
        <p>All four classes have actual or potential applications in battlefield weapons.</p>
        <p>''We take the threat of battlefield lasers very seriously,'' General O'Neill said. ''It doesn't take much to blind someone at least momentarily, and if you can blind an enemy long enough to shoot him with a bullet, you win. This is why we are putting a lot of study into both laser weapons and defenses. They could decide the issue of a battle.''</p>
