        <p>At a time when American doctors are becoming increasingly convinced that high blood pressure, heart disease and strokes can be caused by sleep apnea, a common disorder in which breathing is interrupted repeatedly during sleep, British researchers have challenged that view. They say the importance of the condition has been exaggerated.</p>
        <p>American sleep researchers have, in turn, criticized the British findings and defended the growing trend in this country to diagnose and treat the disorder aggressively, a trend that has led to an explosive growth in the number of accredited sleep clinics, to 337 now from 92 in 1987.</p>
        <p>About 20 million Americans are thought to have obstructive sleep apnea, in which the relaxation of muscles in the mouth and throat closes off the airway. In about two-thirds of the cases, obesity leads to the obstruction. Unable to inhale, victims wake up just enough to gasp and snort, take a breath, then fall back to sleep. The cycle, marked by loud snoring, can occur hundreds of times a night, leaving the person exhausted, irritable, forgetful and unable to concentrate.</p>
        <p>People with severe sleep apnea have trouble staying awake during the day and are prone to car accidents, and studies have also linked the condition to cardiovascular problems. Researchers think that during episodes of apnea, which last from 10 seconds to more than a minute, lack of oxygen and rising carbon dioxide in the blood may cause swings in blood pressure that contribute to chronic hypertension and its damaging effects on the blood vessels, heart and other organs.</p>
        <p>Concern about the potential danger of the condition has led researchers to develop various treatments, from dental appliances to surgery on the mouth and throat. The most common treatment is continuous positive airway pressure, or C.P.A.P., which requires the patient to sleep wearing a mask that blows air into the nose and keeps the airway open.</p>
        <p>The report questioning the need for so much concern about sleep apnea is appearing on Saturday in The British Medical Journal. A team of epidemiologists and public health researchers, led by Dr. John Wright of the Bradford Royal Infirmary in West Yorkshire, analyzed 54 studies of the association between sleep apnea and other health problems, and 45 studies on the effectiveness of C.P.A.P.</p>
        <p>Dr. Wright and his colleagues concluded that most of the studies were poorly designed and provided weak evidence at best that sleep apnea could cause cardiosvascular problems or stroke. They did accept the idea, however, that people who could not stay awake during the day because of severe sleep apnea might benefit from treatment.</p>
        <p>As for C.P.A.P., the British team agreed that it could provide some help for people suffering from daytime sleepiness. But team members thought it should be studied further and compared with other treatments intended to eliminate the underlying causes of sleep apnea, like obesity, smoking and heavy drinking.</p>
        <p>The main problem with the studies, Dr. Wright said, derives from the fact that sleep apnea is associated with obesity and aging, and so when cardiovascular disorders occur as well, it is difficult to sort out what is causing what.</p>
        <p>''Is sleep apnea more of a symptom than a disease itself?'' Dr. Wright asked. ''There's nothing to indicate that in and of itself it's harmful for your health. I think that's good news and hopefully reassuring to patients. But they shouldn't be complacent. They're still at risk of disease and death, but only because of other risk factors. They should try to lose weight and reduce the other factors such as smoking and alcohol.''</p>
        <p>American researchers took issue with Dr. Wright.</p>
        <p>''The data on hypertension is convincing,'' said Dr. David White, an associate professor at the Harvard Medical School and president of the American Sleep Disorders Association, based in Rochester, Minn. ''The information on stroke and heart attack is weaker.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Terry Young, a sleep researcher at the University of Wisconsin, recently published data on hypertension not included in Dr. Wright's study.</p>
        <p>''At this point,'' Dr. Young said, ''controlling for all confounding factors, we see a significant relationship between sleep apnea and elevated blood pressure. The more severe the apnea, the greater the increment in blood pressure. It's a public health concern because the prevalence of sleep apnea is so high.''</p>
