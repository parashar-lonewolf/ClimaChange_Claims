        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re your April 3 news article on the clash between hikers and mountain bicyclists:</p>
        <p>Despite the obvious effects of acid rain, pollution and an unchecked deer population, it is only since the mountain biking craze of the 1980's that the underbrush has been obliterated in Eagle Rock and South Mountain Reservations in Essex County, New Jersey.</p>
        <p>I am a runner who has used both parks daily for 20 years, and never have I seen the woodlands in worse shape. This spells disaster for the steep slopes of the Watchung Mountains, particularly in this era of little or no maintenance of our parklands.</p>
        <p>The increased use by runners and walkers also has put added stress on these bucolic preserves. But it is only since the introduction of bikes that I have noticed a serious decline in trees, plants, thickets, shrubs and flowers.</p>
        <p>Although bikers have been consistently courteous to me, this is where any camaraderie with them ends, for many blaze paths where none ever existed and run roughshod over the vegetation, destroying smaller plants and saplings.</p>
        <p>When a fallen tree blocks a path, bikers go around it, creating a new swath of destruction, thereby carving up the woods into smaller, less visible pieces of understory vegetation. Narrow hiking trails have, in the last several years, come to rival the size of much wider bridle paths.</p>
        <p>A solution must be found quickly before the parks are so devastated by overuse they become barren, rather than the lush, away-from-it-all reserves they always were. Common sense dictates that rubber tires and metal frames supporting adult bodies cannot ride daily over the same terrain -- and blaze new paths -- without destroying the very places that make living in Essex County such a joy.
