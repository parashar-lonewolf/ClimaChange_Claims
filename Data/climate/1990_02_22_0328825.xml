        <p>LEAD: The board of the SPX Corporation has elected Dale A. Johnson as the company's president and chief executive. Mr. Johnson, 52, had been president and chief operating officer since 1988.</p>
        <p>The board of the SPX Corporation has elected Dale A. Johnson as the company's president and chief executive. Mr. Johnson, 52, had been president and chief operating officer since 1988.</p>
        <p>The promotion is effective immediately. In his new posts, Mr. Johnson succeeds Robert D. Tuttle, 64, who will continue as chairman.</p>
        <p>In a statement, the board described the promotion as a ''well-timed step in the company's evolution.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson joined SPX, which is based in Muskegon, Mich., in 1985 after serving as president and chief executive of the Owatonna Tool Company, which SPX acquired that year. Mr. Johnson had been with Owatonna since 1974 in a variety of management positions.</p>
        <p>A native of Minnesota, Mr. Johnson received a bachelor of science degree from Mankato State University and a Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota. Mr. Johnson, who was traveling yesterday, was not available for comment.</p>
        <p>Analysts who follow the company describe Mr. Johnson as a good manager. ''This is a positive move for the company,'' said Wendy Beale Needham, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Company in New York. ''He has a sense of how to focus on the strengths of the company, which is the ability to develop new products.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson played an important role in an overhaul of the company, once known as Sealed Power, Ms. Beale said. Once the nation's largest maker of piston rings for car engines, the company has a potentially lucrative new environmental product.</p>
        <p>SPX makes a machine that recovers and recycles Freon, a chlorofluorocarbon used as a coolant in air-conditioners and refrigerators. Chlorofluorocarbons have been determined to be harmful to the ozone layer of the atmosphere, and the Bush Adminstration plans to ban their production by the year 2000.</p>
        <p>Last summer, SPX signed a contract to supply Freon recycling machines to the General Motors Corporation. Ms. Needham of Smith Barney said the contract might ultimately be worth $29 million in sales.</p>
        <p>The company also makes repair tools and instruments for the motor vehicle service industry.</p>
