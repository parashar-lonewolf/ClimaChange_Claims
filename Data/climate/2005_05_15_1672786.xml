        <p>Sunni Arabs Offer Plan  The Bush administration, struggling to cope with a recent intensification of insurgent violence in Iraq, has received signals from some radical Sunni Arab leaders that they would abandon fighting if the new Shiite majority government gave Sunnis more political power, administration officials said. But the political feuding has so far blocked the kind of concessions the Sunnis are demanding.</p>

        <p>Abbas to Meet With Bush  The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, left, is scheduled to meet President Bush in Washington on May 26, Palestinian officials said, to demonstrate serious progress to the Americans in his efforts at reforming the Palestinian Authority and ending violence.</p>

        <p>Mexico's Ailing Oil Giant  A recent spate of accidents has befallen state-owned oil monopoly Pemex, and highlights the complicated symbiotic relationship between the company and the government that is supposed to regulate it. Pemex provides the government with 40 percent of its income, and the environmental agency that polices the oil company is underfinanced.</p>

        <p>SARS Disappears, for Now  Two and a half years after a mysterious respiratory illness from southern China infected thousands of people around the world and brought dire predictions of recurring and deadly plague, the virus known as SARS has disappeared, at least for the moment.</p>

        <p>Uzbek Chief Defends Tactics  President Islam A. Karimov of Uzbekistan defended a crackdown on a violent uprising that engulfed an eastern city the day before, even as new protests unfolded and hundreds of residents in the region fled to the country's border with Kyrgyzstan.</p>

        <p>Class in America  America has gone a long way toward an appearance of classlessness. The contours of class have blurred; some say they have disappeared. But class is still a powerful force in American life. Over the past three decades, it has come to play a greater, not lesser, role in important ways. This is the first of a series of articles The Times will publish on class in America, a dimension of the national experience that tends to go unexamined, if acknowledged at all.</p>

        <p>Judicial Rules Dispute  Senator Bill Frist, the majority leader, and Senator Harry Reid, his Democratic counterpart, are locked in a dispute over the rules of judicial confirmations that could shape the future makeup of the Supreme Court.</p>

        <p>A New Look at Nuclear Power  Their numbers are still small, but several of the nation's most prominent environmentalists have gone public with the message that nuclear power, long taboo among mainstream environmental groups, should be reconsidered as a remedy for global warming.</p>
