        <p>President Bush spent a busy weekend meeting with seven other world leaders in Genoa, Italy, with mixed results. His session with President Vladimir Putin of Russia brought a promising agreement to coordinate discussions on reducing offensive nuclear weapons and building a limited missile defense.

        <p>The plan for broad arms talks with Russia, to be fleshed out this week in Moscow by the White House national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, is consistent with Mr. Bush's idea of shifting nuclear  thinking to a new, post-cold-war framework.

        <p>President Bush spent a busy weekend meeting with seven other world leaders in Genoa, Italy, with mixed results. His session with President Vladimir Putin of Russia brought a promising agreement to coordinate discussions on reducing offensive nuclear weapons and building a limited missile defense. But Mr. Bush's stubborn resistance to international plans to reduce global warming further isolated the United States from most of its leading allies.</p>
        <p>The plan for broad arms talks with Russia, to be fleshed out this week in Moscow by the White House national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, is consistent with Mr. Bush's idea of shifting nuclear  thinking to a new, post-cold-war framework. But it marks a welcome step away from his administration's earlier view that Washington might simply proceed with its own plans on offensive and defensive weapons and let Moscow react as it wished.</p>
        <p>Missile defenses have not yet been proven technologically feasible. Should that happen, building them without amending or replacing the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty would face fierce opposition from European allies and Congressional Democrats and could set off a new arms race  with Russia and China, undermining America's security rather than strengthening it. Linking  discussions on offensive and defensive weapons makes sense. Russia, with its economy strained and its existing missile force increasingly difficult to maintain, has long favored deep offensive cuts.  Mr. Bush also wants sharp reductions in America's nuclear arsenal. Agreement on cutting warheads might win Russian assent to modify the ABM treaty to permit development of a limited missile shield.</p>
        <p>On global warming, yesterday's joint communiqué fudged over the issue in the absence of a clear consensus. European leaders, including Mr. Putin, reaffirmed their intentions of abiding by the Kyoto Protocol. But Washington refuses to join them, citing the potential drag on future American economic growth. That is shortsighted. At the Genoa meetings, France's president, Jacques Chirac, and Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, were clearly frustrated by Mr. Bush's unreasonable withdrawal from the Kyoto agreement and his vague promises about producing new American proposals.</p>
        <p>Genoa also produced new commitments to address the economic and health problems of poorer nations, including an initial $1.3 billion contribution to a worldwide fund to combat H.I.V./AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. The leaders endorsed expanded debt relief and reduced barriers to imports from developing countries and backed a new global round of trade liberalization talks. The attention to environmental issues and poverty reflected the concerns of many of those who demonstrated peacefully in Genoa. Most protesters were nonviolent. But the deliberate provocations of a small number of anarchists and the harsh reaction of Italian security forces brought tragedy, leaving more than 100 seriously injured and one demonstrator shot dead.</p>
        <p>In planning future meetings, Mr. Bush and his fellow leaders need to steer a course between isolated, bunkerlike gatherings in remote areas and meetings in congested cities like Genoa that lend themselves to violent street demonstrations.</p>
