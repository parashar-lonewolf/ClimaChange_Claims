        <p>The Alabama and Florida beaches damaged in recent hurricanes will naturally recover at least somewhat, coastal scientists say. But how fast and to what extent they can regain their prestorm shape depend on highly variable factors: the damage, how much they already suffer from chronic erosion and how densely they have been developed.</p>
        <p>''It's always the case that there's substantial recovery,'' said Spencer Rogers, a specialist in shoreline processes and coastal construction at the University of North Carolina in Wilmington. ''The question is how much.''</p>
        <p>Many coastal communities need the protection of beaches and cannot afford simply to hope that nature will eventually restore what was lost in the storms, said Paden Woodruff, environmental administrator at the Bureau of Beaches and Coastal Systems of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.</p>
        <p>Mr. Woodruff said the agency already had ''assisted recovery'' plans to move sand onto beaches weakened by Hurricane Charley and would make plans for areas affected by Hurricanes Frances and Ivan as well.</p>
        <p>He added that it was too soon to know where those efforts would be needed or what they would cost. ''It will be a significant effort,'' he said. ''We have a lot of miles of shoreline that have been affected.''</p>
        <p>Similar recovery programs after Hurricane Opal, which struck the Florida Panhandle in 1995, cost more than $30 million, Mr. Woodruff said.</p>
        <p>Storms damage beaches by carrying sand offshore and inland. Some of the offshore sand ends up in or near the surf zone. During calm weather, gentle waves can pick it up and move it back onto the beach. This kind of recovery is already under way, the scientists said, especially in areas that were not plagued by erosion.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, though, storm waves send sand far offshore, into deep water where wave action cannot reach it. Then it is lost unless someone recaptures it and returns it to shore.</p>
        <p>More is lost when waves or storm surges carry sand inland. Dr. Abby Sallenger, a scientist with the United States Geological Survey in St. Petersburg, Fla., said Hurricanes Charley, Frances and Ivan did not produce the extreme overwash seen when Hurricane Andrew struck the Louisiana coast in 1992, stripping all the sand off some barrier island beaches and dumping it into the lagoons behind them.</p>
        <p>But some of the islands struck by Hurricane Ivan ''were really beaten very low and were awash,'' Dr. Sallenger said.</p>
        <p>On natural beaches, this overwash is a benign process, one way beaches retreat inland to defend themselves against rising sea levels. By moving sand inland, ''storms don't destroy the beach, they just move the beach,'' said Dr. David M. Bush, a geologist at the State University of West Georgia and an author of the 2001 book ''Living on the Edge of the Gulf.''</p>
        <p>That is why the undeveloped stretch of beach area near Eglin Air Force Base, about 40 miles east of Pensacola, Fla., ''will probably recover fine,'' Dr. Bush said, even though it was overwashed.</p>
        <p>But on developed beaches, overwash is a big problem. Beachfront condominiums, hotels and roads, for instance, cannot shift inland with the sand, which piles up in streets, yards and even the ground-floor rooms of buildings.</p>
        <p>Typically, it is carted off and dumped inland, more sand lost from the beach.</p>
        <p>Mr. Woodruff said some communities might be allowed to use this sand to replenish storm-damaged beaches. But sand overwashed in hurricanes is often filled with dangerous debris, he said, so it would have to be stockpiled and sifted before being applied to a beach.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, he said, Florida would turn to its inventory of inland sources of sand that could be carted onto beaches. This, along with sand bulldozed or scraped from the beach itself, will be used to build new dunes.</p>
        <p>But artificial dunes do not offer the protection of natural dunes.</p>
        <p>Natural dunes form when a sprig of beach grass, for instance, traps windblown sand. ''The vegetation baffles the wind and induces sand to fall out around the vegetation,'' Dr. Sallenger said.</p>
        <p>The movement of the sand grains creates layers that combine to form hard, closely packed sand. Walk on an artificial dune, he said, and ''you'll sink up to your calves; it doesn't offer the protection of a natural dune.''</p>
        <p>But he added, ''It takes awhile to build up a decent dune.''</p>
