        <p>After meeting yesterday with industry lobbyists unhappy about an international science panel assessing climate change, the State Department has decided to back an engineer from India to become the panel's new chairman.</p>
        <p>The current chairman, Dr. Robert T. Watson, whose term is expiring, is an atmospheric chemist who has long pressed for aggressive action to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases linked to global warming and released mainly by burning coal and oil.</p>
        <p>Dr. Watson, who is also chief scientist at the World Bank, was nominated in 1996 by the Clinton administration.</p>
        <p>His views on climate contrast sharply with those of President Bush, who recently proposed slowing, but not reversing, the growth of such emissions until there was more evidence of potential dangers.</p>
        <p>The Indian engineer, Dr. Rajendra K. Pachauri, an economist as well as an engineer, is currently one of five vice chairmen of the group, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.</p>
        <p>Under the auspices of the United Nations, the panel conducts periodic reviews of the causes and consequences of rising temperatures.</p>
        <p>Auto manufacturers and oil companies have long seen Dr. Watson as a foe, and their lobbyists have said that Dr. Pachauri, who has worked with industry in the past, was clearly preferable.</p>
        <p>Some panel scientists said Mr. Bush might end up regretting the choice, noting that Dr. Pachauri has repeatedly criticized the president for not acting more aggressively to cut emissions from the United States, which is the largest source of heat-trapping gases.</p>
        <p>State Department officials said the decision was seen as a way to build American relations with India, which had been campaigning strongly for Dr. Pachauri.</p>
