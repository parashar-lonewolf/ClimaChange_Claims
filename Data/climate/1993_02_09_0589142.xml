        <p>LONG seen as a wasteland to be drained and built on or dug up, peat bogs have only recently begun to be regarded as resources worth preserving. But just as archeologists, ecologists and other scientists come closer to understanding the mysteries embalmed in bogs, the bogs are disappearing.</p>
        <p>Peat bogs are the product of thousands of years of waterlogging. Frequent rain encourages the development of moss, which, as it dies, accumulates in soggy, oxygen-poor depths as peat. And buried in these depths are detailed time capsules of human and environmental change reaching back 8,000 years.</p>
        <p>Samples of peat from bogs that rise above the surrounding land contain a wide range of organic materials, from pollen to insects to volcanic ash. Scientists studying peat have confirmed the native status of species now extinct and others previously thought to have been introduced in imported peat.</p>
        <p>Since peat is laid down in layers over thousands of years, scientists can trace changes in the natural environment as well as human influence.</p>
        <p>"No other technique can reach back so far, and with such precision, into the past impacts of our species on the environment," said Dr. Keith Barber, a paleoecologist at the University of Southampton. As technology improves, he said, clues from bogs could be used to model future climates. Archeological Marvels</p>
        <p>Over the last 20 years peat lands have produced spectacular archeological finds, dating to the Neolithic. But instead of merely preserving the skulls and bones found in dry sites, oxygen-poor peat bogs preserve skin, hair and sometimes brains.</p>
        <p>Lindow Man, some 2,000 years old, is probably the most studied body ever found in a bog. Workers extracting horticultural peat came upon a human leg in 1984 on the Lindow Moss near Manchester. The machinery destroyed the other leg, but archeologists later found a well-preserved upper body. Scientists eventually teased out the ancient man's age, health, cause of death, even his last meal.</p>
        <p>Dr. Paul Buckland, a wetlands archeologist at the University of Sheffield, said most of the important finds have come during commercial peat extraction.</p>
        <p>Peat is an ideal medium for cultivating plants. About 2.1 million cubic yards of horticultural peat are taken from British bogs each year, with another million cubic yards imported to meet the demand, according to Alan Robertson, a spokesman for the U.K. Peat Producers Association. He said the industry holds almost 15,000 acres of peat land, with little regarded as having "current conservation value."</p>
        <p>While producers may see little conservation value, many scientists and environmentalists do. Because peat accumulates slowly, about four- to eight-hundredths of an inch per year, scientists argue that peat producers are mining a nonsustainable resource. Northern Concentration</p>
        <p>Although found throughout the world, peat bogs have been called the Northern Hemisphere's equivalent of tropical rain forests.</p>
        <p>Conservationists say that continued extraction of peat for horticulture is endangering rare species, destroying an unparalleled scientific archive and contributing to global warming by liberating millions of tons of stored carbon in the form of carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>A study conducted by scientists at the University of Exeter and published last summer by Friends of the Earth, an environmental advocacy group, found that while peat bogs cover only half the area that rain forests do, they hold more than three times the carbon.</p>
        <p>Bogs bear distinctive, though not richly diverse, wildlife. Few plants and animals can survive under conditions of extreme wetness, acidity and a paucity of nutrients. Most of those that do cannot live in any other habitat. Some develop a symbiosis with bacteria and others, like sundews, eat insects. Sphagnum Is the Key</p>
        <p>The most common plant is sphagnum, a sponge-like moss. About 40 species of sphagnum occur in peat lands around the world. Other plants include heather and cotton-sedge, even a couple of hardy orchids.</p>
        <p>Bogs support a few dozen invertebrates, including butterflies, dragonflies and beetles. The larvae of hoverflies, which live submerged in the moss, survive by tapping oxygen from the roots of plants. Bogs are also a refuge for birds, like snipe and grouse.</p>
        <p>There are two types of peat bog ecosystems: raised bogs and blanket bogs.</p>
        <p>Raised bogs are domes of peat as high as 11 yards above the surrounding lowlands. Britain's raised bogs are in the west and north of England, and in Wales and southern Scotland. Ireland had a wealth of this kind of raised bog as well, but centuries of peat cutting for fuel has left little unspoiled.</p>
        <p>Blanket bogs occur on upland moors. Most peatlands in Britain are blanket bog, which is less profitable to exploit than raised bog because the peat varies in thickness and quality and because access by machinery is difficult. Yet some is still cut. Forestry has devoured most of the blanket bog in Britain. From an original area of more than 3.5 million acres, just 10 percent of blanket bog may be left. 'Catalogue of Catastrophe'</p>
        <p>The most pressing issue, though, is raised bog, of which there was little to start with and now precious little left.</p>
        <p>Richard Lindsay, a peat lands specialist conducting an inventory for the British Government, presented his findings recently at a conference. He called it a "catalogue of catastrophe."</p>
        <p>Of an original 165,000 acres of raised bog, only about 8,600 acres remain. A small area in Scotland still must be surveyed, but even if it all proved to be natural bog, which is unlikely, the area would increase only to about 14,000 acres, Mr. Lindsay said. Nearly all of the remaining raised mire is broken bits of bog that have survived extraction, forestry and agriculture. Only one example, a 30-acre bog abutting a Scottish loch, is entirely undisturbed and protected.</p>
        <p>Though peat producers rightly point out that much of the loss occurred before they got involved, they are the most direct threat to the remaining raised bogs.</p>
        <p>Modern extraction techniques require a bog to be drained. then all surface vegetation is removed so peat can be skimmed off in thin layers.</p>
        <p>"The stratigraphic record is destroyed without ever being seen as sediments are dried out and opened up to subterranean aerobic decay," Dr. Buckland said, and the damage is not limited to the areas being cut. Only 40 Years Left?</p>
        <p>Draining lowers the water table in adjacent areas, he said, making the remaining fragments unstable.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lindsay offered a sober scenario: an effective extinction date for Britain's raised bogs in less than 40 years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robertson said such dire predictions were exaggerated, and cited a recent agreement by Fisons P.L.C., one of the largest peat producers, to donate 8,150 acres of raised bog in England to a government conservation group. Of that, 2,700 acres with existing plant cover and wildlife were given outright. The rest, which has already been stripped, will continue to be worked and eventually rehabilitated as a wildlife area.</p>
        <p>The agreement was a pragmatic approach since permission to cut peat on all the sites had already been given. But the Peat Consortium, made up of 10 organizations, including the World Wide Fund for Nature, Friends of the Earth and the Royal Society for Nature Conservation, denounced the deal as not good enough. The group is calling for a complete halt to extraction.</p>
        <p>"The number of sites of lowland raised bog is so small that there is now no room for compromise over their future," said Dr. John Barkham, an environmental scientist at the University of East Anglia and a member of the consortium.</p>
        <p>The Peat Producers Association emphasizes its willingness to restore a wetland environment after extraction is completed. But once the shape of a bog is compromised by draining, scientists say, prospects for restoration to a natural bog are weak. Large Bogs in Canada</p>
        <p>Rich in farmland and energy resources, the United States has not exploited its peat lands as drastically as Europe has, though bogs in Florida and the Northeast have been lost to development.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lindsay said Americans should consider the brink upon which Britain teeters as a warning. Peat cutting for horticulture is believed to be increasing worldwide, especially in Canada, which holds most of the world's resources. Parts of the former Soviet Union also have rich deposits.</p>
        <p>The best way to preserve the bogs is to promote alternatives to peat. Peat producers are marketing 80 low-peat or peat-free products, some made from waste. But these products are used mostly by landscapers and amateur gardeners. Professional growers are not yet convinced that the alternatives are good enough.</p>
        <p>For the British peat industry, which employs 30,000 people and has annual sales of nearly $1 billion, change is likely to take time, though time may be running out.</p>
        <p>"What we are talking about are literally the last fragments of raised bog in Britain," Mr. Lindsay said. "If we don't act now we'll lose them."</p>
