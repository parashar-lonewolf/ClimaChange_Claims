        <p>Two months into the Bush administration, the conservative establishment is getting an extraordinary amount of attention from the White House.

        <p>For many conservatives, the heady days of the first Reagan administration were as good as it gets. Until now.</p>
        <p>Two months into the Bush administration, the conservative establishment is getting an extraordinary amount of attention from the White House. Administration officials regularly attend the meetings of the important conservative coalitions. They coordinate lobbying strategy on issues like President Bush's plan for a tax cut. They take conservatives' recommendations on policy and appointments very, very seriously, and have assembled an administration that is ''more Reaganite than the Reagan administration,'' as Edwin J. Feulner, president of the conservative Heritage Foundation, puts it.</p>
        <p>In fact, conservative leaders say they feel like an integral part of this administration, rather than an outside constituent group, invited in for the occasional photo opportunity with the president. Many also say the contrast could not be more striking with former President George Bush, who alienated much of his conservative base even before he reneged on his ''no new taxes'' pledge.</p>
        <p>In short, says Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform and a leading conservative strategist: ''There isn't an us and them with this administration. They is us. We is them.''</p>
        <p>The impact of this conservative ascendancy is clear on policy and staffing. The first few months have seen a string of victories for what Mr. Norquist calls the ''center-right coalition,'' from reversing the administration's position on regulating carbon dioxide, to rolling back the new Labor Department rules aimed at preventing repetitive stress syndrome, to imposing a new ban on federal aid to international family planning groups that counsel or promote abortions. The conservative influence is felt not only on the major cabinet-level appointments, like Attorney General John Ashcroft and Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao, but also the lower-tier jobs that are now being filled.</p>
        <p>But the benefits flow two ways, particularly as the battle over Mr. Bush's signature tax plan moves to a Senate divided 50-50 between the parties. Conservative groups are providing the administration with additional organizational muscle, grass-roots networks that can be brought to bear on wavering senators and the incalculable security of a strong and contented base.</p>
        <p>A good snapshot of this relationship comes every Wednesday, at 10 a.m., when Mr. Norquist convenes ''the Wednesday meeting'' -- an invitation-only gathering of more than 100 representatives from social, religious and economic groups in the conservative movement, as well as business and trade associations, Republican Congressional leadership offices and the major research groups on the right. These meetings, which began in 1993 to try to stop the Clinton health care initiative, are often focused these days on advancing the Bush agenda. The Bush administration has had at least one representative at every meeting.</p>
        <p>And the lineup is often impressive: Lawrence B. Lindsey, Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser, briefed the group on the president's tax plan at one meeting last month, declaring, ''We have a battle on our hands, but I think it's a battle we're going to win.''</p>
        <p>Moments later, Ken Mehlman, director of political affairs at the White House, told the group that the president's tax cut would pass when the roar from the crowd enveloped the political leaders here in Washington -- as it did, he said, during Mr. Bush's inaugural address. ''The key to this will really be what kind of grass-roots support we get,'' Mr. Mehlman said.</p>
        <p>The Wednesday meeting is an important vehicle for building that support. ''If you want to say, 'Hey, guys, we'd like your help on x, y and z,' there are 110 guys there,'' Mr. Norquist said. ''They come out of that meeting, go back to their groups, and they're talking to thousands of people.''</p>
        <p>Many of the groups at the Wednesday meeting have, in fact, formally endorsed the tax cut in recent weeks and spread the word to their memberships. In some cases, they swallowed objections to particular parts of the bill, or, in the case of business, to omissions. Mr. Norquist argues that this reflects the new maturity of the conservative movement. At one point, he told the Wednesday meeting: ''There's a patience that comes from being in power. We're going to be in power next year and the year after that and the year after. It enables us to play a salami-slicing strategy that the left did for 40 years.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Norquist's meeting ends at 11:30; shortly thereafter, many conservatives head to a lunch meeting that Paul Weyrich began in 1983, which draws about 70 conservative advocates. There, too, someone from the administration has attended every week; at one recent meeting, for example, conservatives expressed concern to an administration official about the issue of embryonic stem cell research, which is under review by the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
        <p>''I've been through five Republican administrations, and the effort to communicate with conservatives and to understand our concerns and address our concerns and involve us in the process is the best of any of the Republican administrations,'' Mr. Weyrich said, ''including Ronald Reagan. In fact, far superior to Ronald Reagan.''</p>
        <p>At the Heritage Foundation, Mr. Feulner says he talks to Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's political czar, a couple of times a week. (Mr. Norquist has known Mr. Rove for 22 years, since they met when they were both members of the College Republicans.)</p>
        <p>When Mr. Feulner spoke to a reporter one recent afternoon, he had just returned from the swearing-in of Ms. Chao, a former Heritage Foundation official, as labor secretary. ''My first time in the Oval Office in quite a few years,'' Mr. Feulner said. Still, he could see a lot of familiar faces, with Heritage alumni now scattered in jobs throughout the administration. Moreover, Mr. Feulner added, Mr. Bush was ''quite enthusiastic'' about some of the policy reports the foundation had sent him.</p>
        <p>And at the conservative Family Research Council, Kenneth L. Connor, its president, says, ''We are afforded access to the highest senior officials.'' When Mr. Connor's group held its two-day annual ''Washington Briefing'' for social conservatives this week, the speakers included Mr. Ashcroft; Mel Martinez, the secretary of Housing and Urban Development; and Tim Goeglein, a deputy in the White House Office of Public Liaison, whose portfolio includes religious and social conservatives. The president delivered a taped greeting, Mr. Connor said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rove is widely credited with creating the political structure that keeps conservatives so happily engaged. Mr. Weyrich suggests that the administration's attentiveness may stem from the closeness of the election, ''that they're there by the grace of God, and if they don't pay attention to their coalition they won't be there.''</p>
        <p>But there may be an even simpler explanation, Mr. Norquist suggests: that Mr. Bush, unlike his father, came of age during a conservative ascendancy, and he is utterly confident in the power and appeal of his conservative beliefs.</p>
        <p>Indeed, said Ralph Reed, the former Christian Coalition strategist who advised the Bush campaign last year, Mr. Bush had a long history as governor of Texas of working closely with ''the grass-roots constituencies that were important to the Republican Party.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Reed added, ''They did not get everything they sought, but it was a very symbiotic, effective and transparent relationship, that was based on respect and in many cases longstanding friendships.''</p>
        <p>As the administration now confronts a recalcitrant Senate, after the House passed the tax cut on a party-line vote, conservatives are hoping to raise the heat. Some conservative groups, like the Issues Management Center, are running radio commercials in selected states. Mr. Norquist's Americans for Tax Reform is working to get state legislatures to pass resolutions in support of the tax cut -- particularly useful in states with Democratic senators.</p>
        <p>Mr. Norquist recently participated in a conference call with hundreds of state legislative leaders, outlining the strategy; Vice President Dick Cheney helped make the pitch.</p>
        <p>Conservative groups are also keeping close watch on the various departments; for example, Christie Whitman of the Environmental Protection Agency has drawn frequent fire from the right on global warming and other issues.</p>
        <p>But some conservative leaders say the movement is simply less wary of the Bush administration than it was of previous Republican administrations. ''Part of it is a more mature center-right coalition that isn't expecting to be double-crossed,'' Mr. Norquist said.</p>
        <p>Part of it, others suggest, is that many conservatives now see themselves less as outsiders than as part of a conservative establishment, with like-minded allies throughout the government.</p>
        <p>Indeed, there is a growing group of conservatives who have now moved in and out of government, Mr. Feulner of the Heritage Foundation said, gaining more and more credentials as they go. Officials at the foundation passed on 1,200 to 1,300 names and résumés to the Bush administration and say they are quite pleased with the results so far, at the cabinet level and at the next tier. Among the recent nominees particularly popular with conservatives was Wade F. Horn, formerly president of the National Fatherhood Initiative, a group aimed at ''restoring responsible fatherhood as a national priority,'' who was nominated assistant secretary at Health and Human Services for family support.</p>
        <p>Part of this evolution for conservatives, Mr. Norquist argues, is an ever closer alliance with the business community. ''Part of what we're doing is bringing K Street and the business community in,'' he said, using shorthand for the lobbying community. ''They should be an integral part of the center-right coalition. What does the business community want?  Deregulation. Free trade. Tax cuts.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Norquist laughs at those who argue that the tension between economic and social conservatives will inevitably plague the Republicans.  ''It's like the physicists who tell you bumblebees can't fly,'' he said. ''But bumblebees fly.''</p>
