        <p>''Lung Cancer: Myths, Facts, Choices -- and Hope,'' by Dr. Claudia I. Henschke and Peggy McCarthy, with Sarah Wernick. W. W. Norton, $26.95.</p>
        <p>''Life and Breath: Preventing, Treating and Reversing Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,'' by Dr. Neil Schachter. Broadway Books, $24.95.</p>
        <p>The lungs and their linked structures are an elaborate mechanism, enabling humans to breathe about 10 to 15 times a minute, an automatic process that draws in a pint of air with every breath.</p>
        <p>As these two books demonstrate, the lungs are exceptionally vulnerable. They are susceptible to environmental pollutants, infection and, because the lungs have no pain fibers, to the silent growth of tumors.</p>
        <p>Dr. Henschke, a radiologist at Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York, and her co-authors take a realistic but hopeful look at lung cancer and its five-year survival rate of only 14 percent.</p>
        <p>It is also the leading cancer killer of women and is vastly undertreated because many patients and even doctors do not realize that treatment can help at every stage.</p>
        <p>Even if the disease has advanced, the authors write, ''treatment can relieve symptoms, improve the quality of life and extend life.''</p>
        <p>''All too many lung patients are told, 'Nothing can be done,' '' the authors continue. ''This is almost never true.'' Early detection, notably with a CAT scan that reveals a great deal more than a simple X-ray, is a key to survival, the authors say. Generally, the cancer isn't discovered until it causes symptoms. By then, it's the size of a small orange and has probably spread.</p>
        <p>''An X-ray can reveal a grape-size lump,'' the authors write. ''But a CAT scan can find tiny tumors no bigger than a grain of rice. '' When treated early, the five-year survival rates soar to 70 percent or even higher, they say.</p>
        <p>Dr. Schachter's book deals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which it describes as the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. Caused when airflow is reduced through the lungs because of chronic bronchitis and emphysema, it often goes unrecognized. Dr. Schachter, a professor at Mount Sinai in New York, discusses treatment and prevention, but stresses that ''chronic obstructive lung disease as we know it today would probably not exist without the epidemic of smoking.''</p>
        <p>Other pollutants, ''the Fatal 4'' that can damage the lungs, are nitrogen dioxide, formed when fossil fuels are burned at high temperatures in cars and power plants; ozone (''an especially nasty pollutant''); sulfur dioxide, formed by burning coal and oil; and particulate matter, a mix of dust and acid aerosols in the air.</p>
        <p>Nearly half of the people with this disease are women, Dr. Schachter reveals, because of increased smoking and women's greater susceptibility to its effects. ''It takes fewer cigarettes to cause profound lung damage in women,'' he says.</p>
        <p>Dr. Schachter also discusses links between diet and chronic lung disease and the role of free radicals (''unhappy molecules'') in provoking a situation known as oxidative stress.</p>
        <p>This stress in turn promotes the release of compounds that play a role in bronchial constriction and mucus production, he writes. It all points, Dr. Schachter suggests, to the protective benefits of antioxidants (which keep free radicals in check), like vitamins E and C, and beta carotene, the form of vitamin A found in fruits and vegetables.</p>
        <p>In theory, he says, they could shield the respiratory system from oxidative damage from pollution and cigarettes, which send ''literally trillions of free radicals down into the lungs.''</p>
        <p>Now, he says, he urges patients to get their antioxidants in diets rich in fruits and vegetables.</p>
