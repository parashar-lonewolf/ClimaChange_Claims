        <p>Rocket exhaust poses a real but relatively small threat to atmospheric quality and the ozone layer, and an international effort should be undertaken to reduce their environmental impact, a new study has found.</p>
        <p>The study, made public today, was the result of a workshop last summer that brought together scientists, environmentalists, regulators and aerospace industry representatives. It concluded that rockets blasting into space generate pollutants that deplete stratospheric ozone, increase acid rain, contribute to global warming and reduce air quality.</p>
        <p>But the study said that the rockets' contribution to these problems was so small relative to other industrial, consumer and natural pollution sources that there was no need for urgent action, like curtailing flights or rushing alternative fuels into use. Many Nations Called Upon</p>
        <p>Dr. Jerry Grey, science and technology policy director for the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, which sponsored the workshop and the study, said all nations that launch rocket-powered vehicles should contribute to an international effort to reduce the problems.</p>
        <p>"This is not a U.S. problem; it's a worldwide problem that has to be addressed internationally," Dr. Grey said at a news conference. "Regulatory restraints on global pollution are going to be more severe in the future, and it will affect launch vehicle operations and testing. No matter how small the environmental effects of rockets are, we can reduce them."</p>
        <p>The report said the effort to clean up rockets should address the next generation of boosters, not those in operation or in advanced stages of development.  The billions of dollars it would cost to modify existing rockets or rush alternative fuels into production could best be used to solve more urgent environmental problems, said Dr. Grey and other authors of the study.</p>
        <p>Solid-fuel rockets are the biggest source of rocket pollutants that can harm the atmosphere. Burning a common component, ammonium perchlorate, produces tons of hydrochloric acid and chlorine, which acts as a catalyst to break down ozone, a form of oxygen that protects the earth from harmful solar radiation. U.S. Is the Leader</p>
        <p>The United States uses more solid rockets than any other nation, including the powerful boosters that propel the space shuttle and the giant, unmanned Titan 4 launcher. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration estimates that each space shuttle flight deposits about 75 tons of chlorine into the ozone layer, which begins about a dozen miles above the ground.</p>
        <p>Steven Aftergood, a senior analyst with the Federation of American Scientists, a private policy group in Washington that has called for more attention to the rocket pollution problem, said he generally agreed with the report's conclusions.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Aftergood, who helped draft the document, said he disagreed with its conclusion that rockets under development should not be modified. NASA is developing new boosters that will allow larger payloads in shuttles, but they basically are designed much like the old ones and use the same fuel.</p>
        <p>"I think NASA's Advanced Solid Rocket Motor program is a step in the wrong direction," Mr. Aftergood said. "Environmentally, it's more of the same, and it's unfortunate we are spending money on this program when it could go to developing a new generation of launch vehicles."</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Aftergood said, although the effects of rockets on ozone is small, "it is not insignificant and should be taken seriously." Less Than Natural Change</p>
        <p>Dr. Grey of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, a professional society with more than 45,000 members in the aerospace field, said annual ozone depletion from chlorides released by rockets appeared to be about 0.02 percent or less, much less than the random natural ozone changes of 1 percent.</p>
        <p>The International Astronautical Federation, a group of 126 space agencies, professional societies and others concerned with space issues, should take the lead in designing a research program to study the environmental effects of rockets, said the report.</p>
        <p>The report said the research effort should be operational within the next two or three years so that it can produce information to influence new generations of rockets expected to be built around the turn of the century, Dr. Grey said.</p>
