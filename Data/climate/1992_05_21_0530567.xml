        <p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl and other German leaders called on the United States today to strengthen its environmental policies before the world environmental summit meeting in Rio de Janeiro next month.</p>
        <p>Speaking to a special session of the German Parliament, Chancellor Kohl said Germany was willing to make substantial new contributions to the Global Environmental Facility, a fund established by the World Bank to support environmental programs in the developing world.</p>
        <p>"I link this readiness with the expectation that other countries are also ready to assume their share of responsibility," the Chancellor said. "I am thinking especially of the United States and Japan."</p>
        <p>According to German officials, the United States is blocking a World Bank proposal to triple the size of the $1.5 billion environmental fund after 1993.  Critical of 'Skepticism'</p>
        <p>Chancellor Kohl was one of the first world leaders to commit himself to attend the Rio conference, which officially opens June 3. Germany has some of the world's most advanced environmental laws, and public opinion here is highly sensitive to environmental issues.</p>
        <p>The Chancellor told Parliament that when he introduced environmental questions at the 1988 economic summit meeting in Toronto, leaders of other industrial powers reacted with "great skepticism and even rejection."</p>
        <p>"The industrialized nations must face their special responsibility," Mr. Kohl said. "Our 20 percent of the world population produces about 80 percent of worldwide carbon dioxide emissions. So it is clear who has the chief responsibility and who must bear the chief burden for reducing carbon dioxide emissions."</p>
        <p>Scientists say these emissions, which come from automobiles and factories, contribute to depletion of the Earth's ozone level, which in turn could produce disastrous changes in the world's climate.</p>
        <p>Environment Minister Klaus Topfer, who also addressed Parliament today, criticized the United States and Japan for refusing to increase energy taxes, as the European Community has suggested. The Europeans, he said, could not take such a step alone.</p>
        <p>Gerhart Baum of the centrist Free Democratic party, which is a member of the governing coalition, criticized the United States for refusing to commit itself to reducing carbon dioxide emissions to the 1990 level by the end of this decade.</p>
