        <p>War, plague, fire, flood -- no disaster is so vast or so heartbreaking that Wall Street can't find a way to make money from it. So, too, with the ominous deterioration in the earth's ozone layer.</p>
        <p>As scientists have grown increasingly alarmed about the effect that chlorofluorocarbons have on this protective shell in the earth's atmosphere, a few sharp money managers have grown increasingly interested in a small chemical manufacturing company called the American Pacific Corporation, based in Las Vegas, Nev.</p>
        <p>The appeal? American Pacific has recently acquired an option to buy the worldwide rights to Halotron, a new fire extinguishing chemical designed to replace Halon, identified as a major cause of ozone damage.</p>
        <p>American Pacific itself is no stranger to disaster. In May 1988, a horrific explosion destroyed a key plant and triggered a plague of litigation that has hampered the company's efforts to grow. But lately, there are signs that this troublesome cloud -- like the earth's precious ozone -- is beginning to dissipate.</p>
        <p>The company's prospects certainly looked bleak on the evening of May 4, 1988, when its plant in Henderson, Nev., wound up in smoky ruins, with two dead and many people injured. American Pacific was one of only two domestic manufacturers of ammonium perchlorate, a volatile chemical used in rocket fuel. The blast totally destroyed the company's key production facility and all of its inventory.</p>
        <p>In a matter of hours, the company's stock plummeted from $8.50 a share to less than $3.</p>
        <p>With substantial help from the Federal space program and from the Thiokol Corporation, the major buyer of the company's ammonium perchlorate, the company was able to build a new plant and resume production by July 1989. That accomplishment both restored its cash flow -- it reported total revenues of nearly $62 million in fiscal 1991, up from a woeful $14 million in the previous year -- and gave the company considerable credibility with Washington and Wall Street.</p>
        <p>Moreover, those who examined the little company's balance sheet closely found some attractive features that pushed beyond rocket fuel. There is the Halotron prospect, of course. The company anticipates that it may be able to exercise its option to develop the new chemical during the current fiscal year, which began Oct. 1. In addition, American Pacific owns and is in the process of developing a substantial chunk of Las Vegas real estate, much of which was acquired at pre-boom prices. And the company has a small pollution abatement business that has gotten a $5.8 million contract to install odor-reducing equipment at a composting facility in Akron, Ohio.</p>
        <p>Finally, American Pacific is poised to become a manufacturer of sodium azide, an ingredient used in making automobile airbags. Under an open-ended pact with Dynamit Nobel A.G. of Germany, American Pacific has an exclusive license to use Dynamit's technology to manufacture sodium azide for sale in the North American market.</p>
        <p>Given the anticipated growth in airbag installations in American cars in the years ahead, several portfolio managers see this agreement as a powerful booster rocket for the company's revenues. "The company's cash flow is excellent from its ammonium perchlorate business, but this is really where I see the big growth coming from," said David Warnock, president of Strategic Partners, one of 17 large institutional investors who took a stake in American Pacific through an equity offering last spring.</p>
        <p>But building a sodium azide plant will cost nearly $30 million -- an amount that the company has found difficult to raise at a reasonable price, given the risks and uncertainty posed by the lawsuits filed against it in the wake of the 1988 blast.</p>
        <p>"It isn't that the lawsuits have been a barrier to financing," said C. Keith Rooker, executive vice president and general counsel. "But the financing will certainly be more costly than it would be, absent the litigation." Indeed, daily life is more costly for the company than it would be absent the litigation: It is spending roughly $1.1 million a year in legal expenses.</p>
        <p>But developments this summer may have raised the odds that the most worrisome of these suits, the one filed by the insurance companies that covered the estimated $75 million in property damage claims, will be settled short of a trial.</p>
        <p>The company's argument is that the blast was caused by a faulty natural-gas pipeline that was installed under the plant site in the 1950's, a view that is opposed by Southwest Gas, which owns the pipeline. In the course of pre-trial research, American Pacific has learned that the pipe used in the suspect line was "mill-reject," said Mr. Rooker, and should never have been used for pressurized gas. Moreover, he said, the old piping was formed through a method that was the subject of industry safety warnings in the early 1980's, but was not replaced.</p>
        <p>These disclosures -- and the mounting legal bills on all sides -- have apparently intensified pressures to settle the cases out of court. While Mr. Rooker said his company is prepared to defend itself in court in January 1993, when the case is scheduled for trial, he added, "My view is that settlement is much more likely than an adjudicated outcome, and I am hopeful that will occur well before trial."</p>
        <p>That would, of course, remove a lingering cloud over the company's prospects and, presumably, lift the pressure on its stock price. Which raises a small question about why Mr. Rooker and Fred D. Gibson Jr., the company's chief executive, recently disclosed plans to sell a portion of their large stake in the company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rooker explained that both men had borrowed money from the company to exercise stock options and "we feel obliged to repay it." He added, "Believe me, if it weren't for that, we wouldn't be selling any of our shares."</p>
