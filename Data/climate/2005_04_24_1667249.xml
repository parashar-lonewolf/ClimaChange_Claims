        <p>Uranium's radioactivity is contained within the nuclear reactor by multiple redundancies of concrete and steel, thereby creating a safety barrier between its production and the public's benefit of clean energy being generated.

Nuclear energy's waste product is contained within the fuel rods, and once energy is produced from the uranium, the used fuel is then transferred into below-ground spent fuel pools for cooling with eventual movement to dry cask storage.</p>

        <p>Uranium's radioactivity is contained within the nuclear reactor by multiple redundancies of concrete and steel, thereby creating a safety barrier between its production and the public's benefit of clean energy being generated.

        <p>There is presently no other viable source of clean energy that produces reliable electricity without the devastating effects of climate change. Nuclear plants release no harmful toxic gases. The burning of coal and gas for electricity releases toxic waste into the environment. Carbon dioxide is the toxic byproduct of burning coal. And, unknown to many, coal-burning plants release toxic radioactive waste into the atmosphere.</p>
