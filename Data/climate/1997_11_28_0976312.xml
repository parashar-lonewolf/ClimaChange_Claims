        <p>Iranian Agents Active in Bosnia</p>
        <p>Western and Bosnian officials say that Iranian intelligence agents are mounting operations in Bosnia and have infiltrated the American program to train the Bosnian Army. The officials said they had identified 200 agents who have insinuated themselves into Bosnian Muslim circles, apparently to gather information and thwart Western interests.</p>

        <p>Tabloids Skewer Diana's Kin  After the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, her younger brother, Earl Spencer, became a celebrity for his condemnation of the tabloid press. Now the British tabloids are giving extensive coverage to his messy court hearing in South Africa, meant to decide whether his divorce case should be heard in Britain or Cape Town.</p>

        <p>Apartheid Scars Live On</p>
        <p>Azhar Cachalia, a former anti-apartheid colleague of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, told South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission that Ms. Madikizela-Mandela was either aware of or took part in the murderous assaults her bodyguards performed during the late 1980's. Mr. Cachalia and other witnesses said that President Nelson Mandela's former wife ignored appeals from Mr. Mandela himself, who was in jail at the time.</p>

        <p>Netanyahu May Remove Troops  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu proposed to carry out a single Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank within five months, if the Palestinians take adequate steps to fight terrorism, and to start talks immediately on a final peace settlement. The offer seemed designed to strike a balance between growing pressure from the United States to move peace efforts forward and from Mr. Netanyahu's right-wing coalition partners not to cede more land to the Palestinians.</p>

        <p>German Students Protest</p>
        <p>Tens of thousands of German students marched through Bonn in a demonstration that crowned weeks of protests and years of discontent over the state of Germany's colleges and universities. Thousands more boycotted classes across the country in the biggest displays of student anger in more than two decades.</p>

        <p>Spanish Safety Fears</p>
        <p>Spain has been rocked by two disasters this month: flood waters tore through a provincial capital in western Spain and killed 21 people, and 9 others died after a municipal water tank exploded in a Spanish protectorate in North Africa. The incidents have increased national concern over Spain's lack of modern safety precautions. Many say the basic problem is that thousands of Spanish homes were built in flood-prone areas.</p>

        <p>F.D.A. and Drug Maker Seek Rules for Thalidomide  Women of child-bearing years who have illnesses that respond to the drug thalidomide have had a difficult time acquiring prescriptions because of the drug's link to horrible birth defects. The Food and Drug Administration and a maker of thalidomide say they are working to impose enough controls to prevent future tragedies, but not enough to prevent women from getting a medicine that could prolong or even save their lives.</p>

        <p>Support for Pollution Controls  As the world's nations gather in Japan to discuss how best to counter the threat of global warming, the American people are far more willing than their Government to take early, unilateral steps, a New York Times Poll finds. They appear to be unimpressed by arguments that cutting the United States' emissions of heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere might cause undue economic harm, as industry groups opposing a treaty have contended.</p>

        <p>Rev. Moon Plans Mass Blessing  In a bid for respectability, the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, who once presided over a mass wedding of his Unification Church members in Madison Square Garden, is now inviting 35,000 married couples -- most of whom do not belong to his church -- to attend a marriage ''blessing'' ceremony Saturday at RFK Stadium in Washington D.C. Mr. Moon has been reaching out to conservative Christians by emphasizing shared goals such as support for abstinence outside of marriage, and opposition to homosexuality.</p>

        <p>On the Trail of a Rare Cougar  Wildlife officials have been prowling the woods around Jasper, Tenn., for the past month in search of an animal that has long been presumed extinct -- an Eastern cougar. No one has actually seen a real Eastern cougar -- also called a mountain lion -- in at least 20 years. But three months ago in the southern Appalachian mountains, reports of sightings began coming in.</p>

        <p>Jerry Brown Campaigns Again  Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown, the former governor of California and former presidential candidate, is running for the mayor of Oakland, Calif., and said that rather than being a step down -- the last stop perhaps of a once promising political career -- becoming mayor of a small city with big problems is a much better place to help rebuild the ''foundation of America, our cities.''</p>

        <p>4 Hurt at Macy's Parade As Float Topples Light Pole  Sudden bursts of punishing wind disrupted Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, as many of the parade's signature helium-filled balloons were damaged. Four spectators were hurt when one of the giant balloons struck a lamppost, plunging the top part of it into the crowd. Two people were hospitalized with severe head injuries. The accident was a strange counterpoint to a day in which most of the two million spectators were far away from the accident and had no idea it happened. Several balloons could not finish the parade, including Barney, the Cat in the Hat and the Pink Panther. A Macy's spokesman said the company had discussed with the police the possibility of removing the balloons from the parade, but decided against it because they thought the wind was subsiding.</p>

        <p>A Shelter in the Holocaust  Nechama Singer Ariel of Borough Park, Brooklyn, was reunited this week with Mikhail and Nikolai Vavrisevich, the two Greek Orthodox brothers, who along with their parents turned their home in Ukraine into a life-saving shelter for seven Jews, including Mrs. Ariel and her mother, during the Holocaust.</p>

        <p>The Hardest Foster Beds  New York City's most unwanted children -- truants, runaways, psychotics and battered girls -- are routinely refused by foster parents who prefer young children to troubled adolescents, but the rush of these children into the foster care system has presented New York City with one of its biggest challenges in years. Since January, more than 1,000 of these children, most of them teen-agers and large groups of brothers and sisters, have slept in a second-floor office in Manhattan while the city scrambles for more foster beds.</p>

        <p>Sanders and Lions Beat Bears  Barry Sanders became the second-leading rusher in National Football League history with a 167-yard, three-touchdown performance as the Detroit Lions kept their slim playoff hopes alive with a 55-20 comeback victory over the Chicago Bears. It was the most points ever scored by the Lions (7-6) in a regular-season game, breaking the record of 52 that had stood for 45 years.</p>

        <p>Cowboys Fall to Oilers  The Tennessee Oilers defeated Dallas, 27-14, in Texas. The loss puts Dallas at 6-7 and the team's chances of making the playoffs are slowly evaporating while the Oilers stay in the thick of the American Football Conference race with a 7-6 record.</p>

        <p>Airlines to Limit Carry-Ons  After years of complaints, the airlines are moving to clear out their increasingly crowded baggage rooms in the sky, by limiting the amount of bags and baggage passengers can bring on board with them. But they are likely to face a new round of complaints, from infrequent leisure travelers, since most business travelers apparently will be exempt from the baggage restrictions. Northwest Airlines is already limiting many passengers to one carry-on bag on its routes, and the United Airlines unit of the UAL Corporation will try out similar restrictions on some routes on Monday.</p>

        <p>Cigar Maker Expands  Spain's dominant cigar maker, Tabacalera, which tried unsuccessfully two years ago to buy control of General Cigar Holdings, one of the largest American cigar makers, is now pursuing the $355 million purchase of two United States and two Central American cigar companies.</p>

        <p>Psychological Tests Grow  Companies large and small are turning to psychological tests, developed by a virtually unregulated test-publishing industry, to try to determine who is too impulsive, who falls short in the integrity department or who is too self-absorbed to make the cut. But in their search for ways to weed out unsuitable candidates, companies are relying too much on the tests while glossing over their limitations and flaws, critics say.</p>
