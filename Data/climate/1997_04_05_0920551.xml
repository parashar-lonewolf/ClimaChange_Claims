        <p>Clinton Holds Rally For Chemical Weapons Ban</p>
        <p>President Clinton made a late push to win Senate ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention. At a bipartisan rally, he shared the stage with James Baker, who negotiated the treaty as Secretary of State under President Bush, and other Republicans and military leaders. The pact, already ratified by 70 nations, will take effect on April 29, with or without the United States' participation.</p>

        <p>Death Stalks Hutu Refugees</p>
        <p>Hundreds of Hutu refugees from Rwanda have died from weakness and disease in makeshift camps in eastern Zaire, where about 80,000 of them are languishing. A United Nations plan to airlift them to Rwanda from the Kisangani airfield has been stymied by Zairian rebels, who have barred their way. The rebels, mostly ethnic Tutsi from Zaire, said they feared epidemics and the presence of armed Hutu militia leaders.</p>

        <p>Few Clues on Saudi Bombing</p>
        <p>The Pentagon lacks adequate evidence about the bombers who killed 19 American airmen in Saudi Arabia last year to warrant retaliation against foreign nations that may have helped them, said Gen. John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. A senior Pentagon official said the investigation into the bombing was likely to continue for months and might never yield proof of the involvement of a foreign government.</p>

        <p>Turkey Lashes Out at Germany</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan of Turkey angrily described recent attacks on Turks in Germany as the result of an ''anti-Muslim campaign'' there. A Turkish woman and her two children were killed in an arson attack in Krefeld, which the Turkish Government listed as the 17th such attack in 1997. German officials rejected the accusation and charged the husband and father of the arson victims with setting the fire. More than two million Turks live in Germany.</p>

        <p>Strikes Proliferate in France</p>
        <p>Strikes and the threat of more have swept across France. Pilots, hospital interns and bank employees have stopped work, and truck drivers have threatened to repeat their strike of last November. Unemployment, at 12.8 percent, is higher than ever, and the popularity of President Jacques Chirac has plummeted, according to polls. The strikers object to cuts in wages and state-mandated benefits they have won over the years.</p>

        <p>Inmates Seize Colombia Jail  Inmates angry about prison conditions in Valledupar in northern Colombia released 2 of at least 10 hostages seized in a violent takeover but demanded bulletproof vests and helicopters before they freed the rest. Four guards were killed when about 10 inmates seized control of the prison on Thursday. The two released were a female guard and a teen-age girl who had been delivering a birthday greeting.</p>

Under a new policy that has been in effect for only a few weeks, the Federal Aviation Administration is announcing major violations by airlines and the fines levied in those cases.

        <p>The Alabama State Police found more than 1,100 pounds of cocaine hidden in a truckload of bananas. The police released the driver of the tractor-trailer after concluding he did not know he was carrying the drugs. State troopers made the find while conducting safety inspections on Interstate 65.</p>

        <p>Getting Concert Tickets Was Wrong, Rowland Says  Gov. John G. Rowland, the first baby boomer to hold Connecticut's highest office, today admitted to violating state ethics laws and blamed a culprit that has swayed so many in his generation: rock and roll. Mr. Rowland has agreed to pay a $2,000 fine for accepting discounted tickets to six concerts from a lobbyist and other third parties. He also said he would donate the value of the tickets -- $1,919 -- to charity.</p>

        <p>Messinger Criticizes Sharpton</p>
        <p>The peace that had enveloped the Democratic mayoral contest appears to have been shattered. Ruth W. Messinger condemned the Rev. Al Sharpton for saying he did not consider Louis Farrakhan an anti-Semite, saying such words would ''only serve to tear us apart.''</p>
        <p>23</p>
        <p>Insurance Overhaul Less Likely</p>
        <p>Prospects that Governor Whitman's plan for a major overhaul of car insurance in New Jersey will be approved by Election Day have dimmed. Twice in recent days, she has been quoted as saying she is uncertain about chances of winning legislative approval of her reform plan by November.</p>

        <p>Arrest in Dominican Republic</p>
        <p>Francisco Medina, whose handiwork on the behalf of drug gangs in the early 1990's, officials say, soaked the streets of the South Bronx and upper Manhattan with blood, has been arrested in the Dominican Republic.</p>

        <p>Unemployment Rate Drops</p>
        <p>The unemployment rate edged down to 5.2 percent last month -- matching its lowest level in eight years -- as the reinvigorated economy continued to improve the labor market. That may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again.</p>
        <p>1</p>
        <p>Stock Market Rebounds</p>
        <p>Despite the threat of higher interest rates, the stock market showed new signs of life, rallying late in the day to put a temporary cap on what had become the market's biggest downturn in two years. The Dow industrials gained 48.72 points. For the week, the Dow lost 215 points.</p>
        <p>36</p>
        <p>Office-Supply Merger Blocked</p>
        <p>The Federal Trade Commission rejected the proposed $4 billion merger of two office supply discounters, Staples and Office Depot, setting the stage for a possible court battle. The action reflects a growing aggressiveness in antitrust enforcement.</p>
        <p>1</p>
        <p>Plan Would Raise Phone Bills</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T, Bell Atlantic and Nynex made a proposal to eliminate $2.5 billion in subsidies from the telephone industry while increasing local phone bills by 75 cents a month. The proposal is an attempt to settle a debate about how much the Government should reduce the access charges that long-distance carriers pay to local phone companies.</p>
        <p>35</p>
        <p>Knight-Ridder to Buy 4 Papers</p>
        <p>The Knight-Ridder newspaper chain said that it was buying the Kansas City Star, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram and two smaller newspapers from Disney for $1.65 billion.</p>
