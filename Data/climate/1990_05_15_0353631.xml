        <p>French and Soviet scientists studying the Vostok ice core in East Antarctica have fine-tuned the link between methane levels and climate shifts over the past 160,000 years. They argue that fluctuations in carbon dioxide and methane concentrations were probably responsible for 50 percent of the cases of dramatic warming and cooling of the earth during the last two ice ages.</p>
        <p>The scientists determined atmopheric methane concentrations by measuring the composition of air bubbles trapped in the polar ice more precisely further back in time than previously recorded.</p>
        <p>They found that that methane was invariably present in much lower concentrations during glacial periods and in much higher concentrations during periods of warming. The results indicate that natural events have never produced methane levels as high as they are today.</p>
        <p>The study, written by J. Chappellaz and colleagues, is reported in the current issue of the British journal Nature.</p>
        <p>''This paper goes way beyond what has been shown before in determining the sharpness of the correlation between methane and climate change,'' said Ralph Cicerone, chairman of the geosciences department at the University of California at Irvine. ''They have put some hard numbers on theories that atmospheric methane concentrations are strongly correlated with the climate of the earth.''</p>
        <p>Recent studies have shown that methane in the atmosphere has nearly doubled, from 350 parts per billion by volume during the ice ages to 650 parts per billion during interglacial periods. The current level is 1,700 parts per billion.</p>
        <p>The new study does not yet prove that high levels of carbon dioxide and methane, which are so-called greenhouse gases, cause the earth's temperature to rise, but it does lend credibility to that assumption, Professor Cicerone said.</p>
        <p>In recent years many scientists have warned that methane could contribute strongly to global warming because it traps heat in the atmosphere. From 425 million to 675 million tons of methane are emitted each year, and levels are increasing.</p>
        <p>Wetlands are the principal natural source, but the gas also arises from forest fires, termites, coal mines, landfills, and the digestive tracts of animals like cattle and goats. Human-induced sources are believed to account for about 60 percent of the methane currently emitted.</p>
