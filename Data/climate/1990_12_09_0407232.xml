        <p>A spacecraft bound for Jupiter was back in the neighborhood yesterday, racing close by Earth for an infusion of gravitational energy to give it the added velocity and change of direction needed to proceed into the outer solar system.</p>
        <p>The Galileo spacecraft came within 600 miles of Earth over the Atlantic Ocean 1,000 miles due east of Miami. Its closest approach, at 3:35 P.M. Eastern daylight time, was near the region of legendary mystery and disaster known as the Bermuda Triangle. But Galileo, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said, came and went without incident.</p>
        <p>"The mission's going along perfectly," said Dr. William J. O'Neil, the project manager. "We couldn't ask it to be any smoother."</p>
        <p>Officials of the $1.3 billion mission to Jupiter enjoyed pointing out that this was the first time an interplanetary spacecraft has come in from afar to fly by Earth and view it in passing, much as craft like the Mariners and Voyagers reconnoitered all other planets in the solar system except for Pluto. Testing the Equipment</p>
        <p>Dr. O'Neil said the spacecraft was operating automatically as it passed Earth, its computers following minute-by-minute instructions radioed to Galileo earlier in the week from the control center at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.</p>
        <p>Dr. Torrence V. Johnson, Galileo's chief scientist, said the craft's cameras and scientific sensors were given a thorough test during the passage by Earth. While approaching and departing, Galileo made detailed observations of the Moon's far side with sensitivities not available when craft from Earth last explored that hidden landscape in the early 1970's. As Galileo sped away, it examined of Earth's surface chemistry, upper atmosphere and magnetic fields.</p>
        <p>Because the Earth and Moon are well-known bodies, scientists will be able to use the observations to calibrate their instruments before it goes into an orbit of Jupiter in December 1995 to explore the Jovian moons and atmosphere. Data on the water content of Earth's upper atmosphere could also be important in studies of the potential of air pollution to cause global climate change and in testing a theory that a steady bombardment of tiny comets could account for much of Earth's water.</p>
        <p>But the main reason for Galileo's encounter was to get the first of two gravitational boosts from Earth that should help fling it on a trajectory to Jupiter. Other spacecraft have flown by Venus and used its gravity to gain energy to get to Mercury, or flown by Jupiter and Saturn for a boost on the way to Uranus and Neptune. This is the first time Earth is being used in a gravity-assist mission.</p>
        <p>Galileo was deployed by shuttle astronauts in October 1989 and boosted out of Earth orbit by attached rockets. But these boosters lacked the power to send the craft on a direct trajectory to Jupiter. Instead, Galileo was sent toward Venus, which it looped last February to pick up velocity for the first of two flights by Earth. As Galileo approached, the pull of Earth's gravity increased the craft's velocity by 11,600 miles an hour, to 30,742 miles an hour at closest approach and changed its direction by nine degrees.</p>
