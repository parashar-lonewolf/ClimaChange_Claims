        <p>(Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>KELS, by Maggie Dubris. (Soft Skull, paper, $14.95.) One tough girl is Orlie Breton, a New York City paramedic and poet from Ohio who works Hell's Kitchen and the morgues in this novel that makes grand statements about our social disasters without passing through pomposity; Orlie can often do nothing right but winds up a heroine in the tabloid press.</p>
        <p>SNOW, by Orhan Pamuk. (Knopf, $26.) Ka, the blocked-poet hero of this notable Turkish novel, returns from self-exile to look into the deaths of some girls who killed themselves after their schools forbade their headscarves. The line between farce and tragedy falls where secular and Islamic Turkey meet; Ka falls foul of believers' charges of atheism, while the secular government cops fear his snooping.</p>
        <p>COCKTAILS, by D. A. Powell. (Graywolf, paper, $14.) Exceptional poems by a poet of extravagant imagination whose long, stuttering lines can render personal glosses to New Testament scenes or reflect his personal sexual history (the title puns on the medical treatments that keep his H.I.V. in check).</p>
        <p>THE LAMENTS, by George Hagen. (Random House, $24.95.) A novel staffed by a family of white African liberals on the run, from South Africa to England to New Jersey; standard and nonstandard troubles (a suicidal father, a baby switched in the hospital, flag-waving neighbors in America) render it a family novel with a black comedy always in the near middle ground.</p>
        <p>JEROME ROBBINS: His Life, His Theater, His Dance, by Deborah Jowitt. (Simon &amp; Schuster, $40.) A grand survey of the great and deservedly popular choreographer of ballet and Broadway, as well as a personal examination of a radically unhappy man; at 57 he could call himself ''a Jewish ex-commie fag who had to go into a mental hospital.''</p>
        <p>BOILING POINT: How Politicians, Big Oil and Coal, Journalists, and Activists Are Fueling the Climate Crisis -- and What We Can Do to Avert Disaster, by Ross Gelbspan. (Basic Books, $22.) Gelbspan, a reporter who learned to fear global warming while researching a previous book, indicts all parties (see the subtitle) in this one, where he joins muckraker predecessors in both exposing evils and proposing bold proceedings to eliminate them.</p>
        <p>PERSEPOLIS 2, by Marjane Satrapi. (Pantheon, $17.95.) Satrapi's second graphic memoir picks up with the 14-year-old Marjane in a boardinghouse in Vienna, where her parents in Iran have sent her to be educated in safety and freedom. Freedom, as it often does, leads to trouble, and the obviously non-Austrian Satrapi winds up homeless. Back in Iran, she fits in no better than ever. Does this sound charming, funny and tender? Well, it is.</p>
        <p>PASTORELLES, by John Taggart. (Flood Editions, paper, $13.95.) A poet of understated, photographic accuracy pins his love of rural Pennsylvania, its stone walls and old beech trees, on lines whose flat repetitions suggest dryness and frustration; a voice so little embellished permits him to undertake an irony-deprived high style when he chooses.</p>
