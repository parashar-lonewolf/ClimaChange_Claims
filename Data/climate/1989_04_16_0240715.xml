        <p>LEAD: The announcement three weeks ago that chemists had initiated nuclear fusion in a jar of water prompted a wave of speculation that a revolutionary new energy source had been discovered.

        <p>The announcement three weeks ago that chemists had initiated nuclear fusion in a jar of water prompted a wave of speculation that a revolutionary new energy source had been discovered. But as growing numbers of skeptical physicists examine the claim, many predict that the bubble is about to burst.</p>
        <p>Dr. Phillip F. Schewe, a staff member of the American Physical Society and the organizer of an approaching national symposium of physicists on room-temperature fusion, said few physicists who are experts on fusion accept the claim. Other physicists predicted in interviews that experiments now in progress might settle the issue within the next few weeks and that they would be surprised if the results were anything but negative.</p>
        <p>Although many chemists have cautiously lauded the American and British chemists claiming to have discovered cold-water fusion, many physicists contend that chemists lack the specialized training, equipment and insights to carry out subtle experiments in nuclear physics. Hopes of Success</p>
        <p>The stakes in the dispute are high. If fusion energy could be exploited commercially, its proponents believe it could one day replace fossil fuels and nuclear fission energy, which is derived from the splitting of uranium or plutonium atoms.</p>
        <p>At the focus of the fusion debate are Dr. B. Stanley Pons, an electrochemist at the University of Utah, and his collaborator, Dr. Martin Fleischmann, a chemist at the University of Southampton in England.</p>
        <p>The two experimenters reported at a news conference March 23 that they had created fusion energy using a simple electrolytic cell filled with heavy water, water in which ordinary hydrogen is replaced by its heavier isotope deuterium. When an electric current was passed through the heavy water between two electrodes, the heavy water molecules were split into their constituents, deuterium and oxygen. Deuterium atoms were drawn to the palladium cathode and absorbed into the metal. According to Dr. Pons, the deuterium atoms were then packed within the crystal lattice of the metal so closely together that their mutual repulsion was overcome and their nuclei fused, creating energy.</p>
        <p>Some theoretical physicists, working on the tentative assumption that the Utah experiment is valid, are looking for explanations of the results. Dr. K. Birgitta Whaley of the University of California at Berkeley, among others, believes she has found a mechanism that might account for the fusion of deuterium atoms within a palladium crystal. Confirmation Reported</p>
        <p>Several laboratories around the world have reported repeating the Utah experiment and obtaining the same or similar results. Confirmation of all or part of the experiment was announced by Kossuth University in Hungary, Moscow University, Texas A &amp; M University and the Georgia Institute of Technology.</p>
        <p>But physicists elsewhere are skeptical of the significance of these reports. Many noted that the Texas experiment only measured heat, not the neutrons that Dr. Pons said were also produced by the reaction. A day after his initial announcement, the leader of Georgia Tech's experimental team, Dr. James Mahaffey, withdrew his confirmation of the Utah work because the confirmation experiment was based on flawed measurements.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ronald F. Parker, director of the Plasma Fusion Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in an interview Friday that of at least 20 experiments with which he was personally familiar, not one had produced acceptable confirmation of the Pons-Fleischmann claim.</p>
        <p>Dr. Parker's own group at M.I.T., as well as research teams at Bell A.T.&amp;T. Laboratories, the California Institute of Technology and ''scores of other major research groups,'' had been attempting to reproduce the Utah results ever since they were announced, but without success, he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Pons and Dr. Fleischmann published their report Wednesday in a Swiss periodical, the Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry and Interfacial Electrochemistry. The University of Utah group and a competing team at Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah, have both submitted papers to the prestigious British journal Nature claiming discovery of a fusion phenomenon.</p>
        <p>Dr. Parker said that an ''autopsy'' of a palladium cathode used in the Pons-Fleischmann experiment could provide the needed ''smoking gun.'' Helium Is Clue</p>
        <p>''If properly chosen samples of the palladium were analyzed and helium were found,'' he said, ''we could take it as strong evidence of fusion, especially if the helium concentration in the cathode could be shown to increase with time while the experiment was running.''</p>
        <p>When the isotopes of hydrogen fuse together, they form helium. If helium has not been formed, it is virtually certain that fusion has not occurred.</p>
        <p>Dr. Pons himself told an audience of more than 7,000 chemists in Dallas on Wednesday that palladium cathodes from his experiments had, in fact, been sent to a suitable laboratory for analysis.</p>
        <p>Dr. Donald Correll, a fusion specialist at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, Calif., was among several specialists who called follow-up experiments essential before any assessment could be made of Pons claim.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of uncertainty about these neutrons that Pons says are coming out,'' he said. ''In the case of the Brigham Young University experiment, the results are slightly easier to believe.''</p>
        <p>The Brigham Young work, conducted by a team headed by Dr. Steven Jones, involved a cell similar to that used by the University of Utah team. Dr. Jones did not observe any heating in his own experiment, however, and although slightly more neutrons were produced than ordinarily occur as natural ''background,'' the increased neutron production, if any, appears negligible. The chances that such a process could provide commercial quantities of energy seem remote, many experts say.</p>
        <p>Dr. Correll said: ''Some of us physicists could at least accept the theoretical possibility of a fusion reaction producing the handful of neutrons Jones saw. On the other hand, if you tell us that such a reaction is enough to produce the heat measured in the Pons experiment, you'd lose a lot of us. If you asked us to accept the notion that some new form of fusion is involved, you'd lose almost all of us.''</p>
        <p>While scientists have not ruled out the possibility that some exotic, heretofore undiscovered fusion reaction has occurred, most physicists regard it as unlikely. Fear of a Debacle</p>
        <p>Many also believe that experimental error or misinterpretation of results may be leading some researchers into a debacle reminiscent of the ''polywater'' uproar of the 1960's and 1970's.</p>
        <p>In 1962, Nikolai Fedyakin, a researcher from an obscure Soviet laboratory, reported that when water vapor condenses as liquid in very fine glass tubes, it forms a viscous fluid heavier than ordinary water and with some very peculiar properties. In 1966, a prestigious Moscow laboratory reproduced the results but concluded that the curious liquid in the capillary tubes was ''polywater,'' a polymerized form of water in which ordinary water molecules were linked in long chains.</p>
        <p>The news galvanized the world press, because it implied that if polymerization should get out of control, all the world's water might be converted to jelly and life would be extinguished.</p>
        <p>The British crystallographer J.D. Bernal called the discovery of polywater ''the most important physical-chemical discovery of the century.''</p>
        <p>The Department of Defense and the Office of Naval Research sponsored research into ways to manufacture large quantities of polywater. Reportedly successful polywater experiments were conducted at several prestigious American and European research institutes, but the bubble burst in 1970-71. At Purdue University, scientists found that polywater made from ordinary water and polywater made from heavy water had exactly the same spectral characteristics - an impossibility, if polywater truly existed.</p>
        <p>Finally, researchers at Bell Laboratories and Los Alamos National Laboratory proved by very careful analyses that there was no water at all in polywater; it consisted solely of a mixture of impurities, including sodium, chlorine, potassium and other elements.</p>
