        <p>LEAD: E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company, the world's largest producer of chlorofluorocarbons, announced plans today to phase out all production of the chemicals that scientists say are contributing to the destruction of the earth's ozone shield.</p>
        <p>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company, the world's largest producer of chlorofluorocarbons, announced plans today to phase out all production of the chemicals that scientists say are contributing to the destruction of the earth's ozone shield.</p>
        <p>While the company refused to set a target date for ending production of the chemicals, Joseph M. Steed, environmental manager of Du Pont's Freon products division, said that reducing output by at least 95 percent by the beginning of the next century was a ''reasonable goal.''</p>
        <p>The company said it was taking the action, which would go well beyond its previous commitment only to reduce output of the chemicals, because of new scientific evidence that the threat to the atmospheric ozone layer was worse than had been thought. An International Agreement</p>
        <p>Du Pont's action indicated a readiness to surpass the goals of an international agreement reached in Montreal last fall calling for an initial freeze on production levels and then a 50 percent reduction in their use by the end of the century.</p>
        <p>The company's decision is bound to have wide influence because Du Pont accounts for about 25 percent of the world's production of chlorofluorcarbons, or CFC's. The chemicals, which are widely used in refrigerants, foam insulation and cleaning solvents, among other products, are believed to combine with and destroy ozone molecules in the upper atmosphere.</p>
        <p>The ozone shield blocks harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun that can cause skin cancer in humans, damage plants and harm animals. Treaty Ratification Urged</p>
        <p>Du Pont urged today that more countries quickly ratify the Montreal protocol. It also called for immediate reassessment of the problem and consideration of ''additional global limitations on the emission of CFC's.''</p>
        <p>So far, only the United States and Mexico have approved the treaty. The treaty will take effect when it is ratified by 11 countries, including countries that account for at least two-thirds of the world's production of CFC's.</p>
        <p>Du Pont also called on other producers and users of CFC's in the United States and abroad to follow its example. Because it accounts for so large a proportion of global production, its own actions are likely to have a major impact on world CFC markets.</p>
        <p>Previously, Du Pont supported limitations on the growth in the use of CFC's but said it was premature to consider eliminating their use entirely. New Evidence Cited</p>
        <p>The company said today that new evidence presented last week by a panel of scientists coordinated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration showed that much deeper cuts are needed to reduce chlorine in the atmosphere and protect the earth's environment. Data presented by the report indicated that global ozone was already depleted by more than 2 percent.</p>
        <p>Du Pont officials said immediate cuts would not help matters much because the quantity of CFC's that would be emitted over the next few years was small compared to the amount of chlorine already accumulated in the atmosphere. Many of the chemicals linger in the upper atmosphere for a century or more, destroying ozone all the while.</p>
        <p>Du Pont is already developing substitutes for CFC's, but company officials said it might take some time to develop and test them for safety and other factors. But the company has been a leader in the search for substitutes, which experts say could become a major new source of company sales.</p>
        <p>Several environmentalists also said today that as scientific evidence mounted that CFC's were thinning the ozone layer and presenting a threat to public health, Du Pont and other producers of the chemicals were in growing danger of being sued for damages. Company's Decision Praised</p>
        <p>But the environmentalists, as well as members of Congress and Lee M. Thomas, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, had chiefly words of praise for the company's decision.</p>
        <p>David D. Doniger, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said he welcomed Du Pont's support for a total end of CFC production, adding that his organization was the first to propose such a plan two years ago.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Doniger said the Du Pont statement left some ''major questions'' open, including the timing of the production phase-out. He said his group supported a complete end to production of CFC's and halons, chemicals used in fire extinguishers that also deplete ozone, within the next six to eight years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thomas said Du Pont's decision to phase out CFC production was ''very encouraging,'' and added: ''It strengthens worldwide efforts to protect stratospheric ozone by sending an unmistakable signal that alternatives and substitutes to CFC's can be made readily available in the near future.'' #3 Senators Back Move Three Senators who recently sent a letter to Du Pont asking that it keep a commitment made a decade ago to end production of CFC if scientific evidence proved their dangers said they were delighted with the company's decision. The Senators are Dave Durenberger of Minnesota and Robert T. Stafford of Vermont, Republicans, and Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat.</p>
        <p>Senator Baucus has introduced legislation that would require an immediate reassessment of the Montreal protocol and a 95 percent cut in CFC production over the next eight years.</p>
        <p>R. E. Heckert, chairman of the Du Pont board, answered the Senators' letter two weeks ago by saying that based on current evidence it would be premature for the company to gradually end CFC production.</p>
        <p>But in a letter today to Mr. Baucus and Mr. Durenberger, Mr. Heckert said last week's report by the NASA panel contained ''important new information'' that led the company to conclude that ''additional actions should be taken for long-term protection of the ozone layer.''</p>
