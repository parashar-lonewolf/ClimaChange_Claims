        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>About avoiding mosquito bites (''Don't Get Stung: Outsmarting the Mosquito,'' July 1), there are some time-honored ways: avoid scented products like colognes and hair sprays because odors attract mosquitoes; wear light-colored smooth fabrics instead of bright prints or dark rough clothing, which attract mosquitoes; avoid bright jewelry and other metal objects, which mosquitoes find alluring; keep screens in good repair; avoid stacking firewood and compost heaps against your home; keep garbage cans covered; and, because mosquitoes are attracted to carbon dioxide, you could try talking as little as possible while outdoors.</p>
