        <p>LEAD: SOMEDAY soon, utility shareholder and customers will find out which of them will pay for the last of the approximately 100 nuclear reactors that were ordered, but never completed, at a cost of about $30 billion.</p>
        <p>SOMEDAY soon, utility shareholder and customers will find out which of them will pay for the last of the approximately 100 nuclear reactors that were ordered, but never completed, at a cost of about $30 billion.</p>
        <p>From legislatures, public service commissions and the United States Supreme Court, decisions are approaching on issues involving the last of the wave of uneconomic nuclear plants. The pipeline of plants begun in the early 1970's is finally emptying, even amid speculation that growing energy demand and concern about burning fossil fuels may revive the industry. But for now, utilities and ratepayers everywhere are finding painful loose ends to tie up.</p>
        <p>Regulators and utilities have found the old rules hard to apply to new circumstances. The problem comes from construction projects that got out of hand in a way that coal or hydroelectric plants could not. Nuclear plants could exceed planned costs by 1,000 percent, come to represent most of the capital of the parent company, and stretch through more than a decade of construction.</p>
        <p>''The utilities have learned, with rate regulation in nuclear plants, it's tails you win, heads I lose,'' said John J. Taylor, a vice president of the Electric Power Research Institute, an industry research consortium based in Palo Alto, Calif. Because the industry changes as the construction proceeds, he said, ''you're being second-guessed to the point that you're almost assured of losing one way or another.''</p>
        <p>Consumer advocates, meanwhile, say that in ignorance and overconfidence, utility companies have spent billions unnecessarily.</p>
        <p>Two of the biggest and last loose ends are the Seabrook and Shoreham nuclear plants, completed but inoperable because of local opposition. Each could raise the total cost of abandonments by an additional $5 billion.</p>
        <p>Seabrook's principal owner, the Public Service Company of New Hampshire, which has filed for bankruptcy, is hoping for some relief in a case that the United States Supreme Court will hear next term. The case, brought by two Pennsylvania utilities, tests the ''used and useful'' doctrine, which bars utilities from recovering costs from their customers unless the plant is in service.</p>
        <p>''Used and useful'' is a cornerstone of regulation of utilities in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and a score of other states. The Pennsylvania case involves four reactors canceled by the two utilities when work had barely begun. Now the utilities are seeking relief for their investors, who have borne all the costs.</p>
        <p>The Duquesne Light Company and the Pennsylvania Power Company argue that planning the plants was prudent because electricity consumption was rising rapidly in the 1960's and early 1970's, and that cancellation was prudent, too, after the growth dropped off and the 1979 Three Mile Island accident and other events showed the disadvantages of nuclear power. The companies raise a contention that goes to the heart of the longstanding bargain between monopoly utilities and the public.</p>
        <p>''A system of regulation (such as Pennsylvania's) that prohibits investors returns in excess of a 'reasonable' rate of return creates certain investor expectations,'' the companies said in a brief filed with the Court. ''These have included a general expectation that at least some of the risks of loss are shared with the consumer, and a specific expectation that the investor would at least be permitted to obtain the return of his or her prudent investment. A rate order that frustrates reasonable investor expectations is confiscatory.'' Worthless Investments</p>
        <p>An opposing brief filed by a coalition including the National Governors' Association and the United States Conference of Mayors conceded that the utilities ''may not have been at fault when they risked a substantial sum on an investment that turned out to be worthless.'' But, it added, ''Clearly, neither the public nor the ratepayers were at fault. They were not consulted about the appellants' plans, and the canceled plants - which never proceeded beyond the planning stage - cannot conceivably benefit them.'' The law does not ''mandate recovery of all prudent investments,'' the opposition brief argues.</p>
        <p>The question of Shoreham, meanwhile, is before the New York Legislature, which is being asked by Governor Cuomo to approve measures giving the Long Island Lighting Company a guaranteed series of rate increases in return for abandoning the reactor. Opponents argue that the utility's shareholders and bondholders would get off too lightly. That may be a moot point, because the company in relation to its liability resembles a teen-ager who has cracked up the family Cadillac. Shareholders' equity is a small fraction of the cost of the plant.</p>
        <p>Simply putting a plant in service is no guarantee against confrontations over costs. In California, for example, even after the Diablo Canyon reactors were opened, state officials and Pacific Gas and Electric Company reached agreement faced each other in bitter disagreement about whether the utility had wasted up to $4.1 billion through bad management of construction.</p>
        <p>Last month, the parties reached an agreement that threw out a standard used in setting electricity rates for most of this century: how much was spent to build the plant. Instead, they adopted a a novel approach that mimics unregulated industries. Rates will be based largely on how much the plant produces.</p>
        <p>The agreement still faces public hearings, beginning next month, and approval by state regulators.</p>
        <p>The utilities and the states have a respite of sorts on such issues because there are nearly no newly completed plants. Meanwhile, Mr. Taylor and others say the companies are shying away from large, capital-intensive projects.</p>
