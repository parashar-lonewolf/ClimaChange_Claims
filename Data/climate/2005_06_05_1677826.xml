        <p>SOME transportation experts are betting that hydrogen will eventually power most cars, while others see substantial, perhaps insurmountable, hurdles. Here is a primer on the benefits and disadvantages:</p>
        <p>Q. What is hydrogen, and where does it come from?</p>
        <p>A. It is the lightest gas and the simplest, most abundant element in the universe. Because it is present in so many compounds, including water, supplies cannot be exhausted. But hydrogen is not actually a fuel, and can be used in a vehicle only after it is separated from other elements. This process itself consumes energy.</p>
        <p>Q. How is hydrogen used to power a car? And what's a fuel cell?</p>
        <p>A. A fuel cell uses a chemical process, similar to that in a battery, to produce electricity -- in this case, from hydrogen that flows into the cell from a storage tank. This electricity drives the fuel-cell car's electric motor; the only byproducts are heat and water.</p>
        <p>Q. What are the potential advantages?</p>
        <p>A. Because hydrogen is found everywhere, supplies are not only infinite, they pose no geographic challenges. It can be produced, albeit expensively, from emission-free sources like solar panels, wind turbines or even nuclear plants. Fuel cells can be easily scaled up or down in size, so they could replace small computer batteries or large power plants. A hydrogen car emits no pollution or global warming gases, aside from what might have resulted from producing the hydrogen itself.</p>
        <p>Q. If it's so great, why aren't we driving hydrogen cars right now?</p>
        <p>A. Widespread use of fuel-cell cars will have to wait until the cells become cheaper and more efficient, and until storage methods have evolved to give vehicles a travel range of perhaps 300 miles. Hydrogen production will have to be scaled up and standardized, and pumping stations equipped for hydrogen refueling at an affordable price.</p>
        <p>Q. I've heard about the Hindenburg -- is hydrogen safe?</p>
        <p>A. Hydrogen is very flammable, and poses special challenges: it burns without a visible flame, for instance. But it is arguably no more dangerous than gasoline, and fuel-cell cars are built with leak detectors and very strong crash-resistant tanks. As for the Hindenburg tragedy of 1937, a retired NASA engineer, Addison Bain, theorizes that the dirigible burned not because it contained hydrogen, but because its cloth skin was coated with highly flammable paint. Others disagree with his assessment.</p>
        <p>Q. How will a car carry hydrogen?</p>
        <p>A. Hydrogen can be stored as a gas, as a liquid or in metal hydrides, which are chemical sponges, but each form has advantages and disadvantages. Still, much of automakers' current research focuses on pressurized hydrogen gas.</p>
        <p>Q. When will I have a hydrogen car in my driveway?</p>
        <p>A. Joseph Romm, a former Department of Energy official and author of ''The Hype About Hydrogen'' (Island Press, 2004), says, ''I doubt that in the next 20 years an affordable, durable and efficient vehicle will be delivered that will be attractive to the public.'' But a renewable energy advocate, Amory Lovins of the Rocky Mountain Institute, says the nation's car fleet could be converted to hydrogen in less than a decade, and a network of small hydrogen reformers (devices that produce hydrogen from natural gas or other sources) could be quickly installed in 10 to 20 percent of the nation's 180,000 gas stations for $2 billion to $4 billion.</p>
        <p>Q. Is this just a lot of hype?</p>
        <p>A. Some overblown claims have already been disproved. But there is also groundbreaking research backed by serious testing programs. Lawrence D. Burns, General Motors' vice president for research and planning, says G.M. aims to have a production-ready fuel-cell vehicle (built on an innovative ''skateboard'' platform that could support a variety of bodies) by 2010. DaimlerChrysler is running 30 fuel-cell buses in Europe and helping to seed a hydrogen infrastructure in Iceland.</p>
        <p>Fuel-cell Toyota Highlanders are being tested at two California universities; both the City of Los Angeles and the State of New York are using Honda FCX's. Nissan will reportedly lease a few X-Trail fuel-cell S.U.V.'s to American businesses in 2007.</p>
        <p>Q. Will fuel-cell cars be cheap to operate? Where will I fill up?</p>
        <p>A. Hydrogen's current price is three to four times that of gasoline. The Department of Energy has issued optimistic cost estimates, but they assume widespread commercial acceptance of hydrogen fuel -- which is at least a decade away. There are only a few hydrogen stations scattered around the country, though California envisions a 170-station ''hydrogen highway'' by 2010; Florida has announced a similar plan.</p>
        <p>Q. How long will fuel cells last?</p>
        <p>A. The journal of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers says the life of fuel cells may be only a fifth as long as that of a typical gasoline engine -- about 30,000 miles versus 150,000. Ben Knight, vice president for automotive engineering at Honda, agrees that the durability of fuel-cell stacks is ''a work in progress,'' but promises ''a significantly longer life'' from newer designs.</p>
        <p>Q. Can you run a regular engine with hydrogen, without fuel cells?</p>
        <p>A. Yes. A hydrogen Cadillac was featured at President Jimmy Carter's inauguration in 1977. A Mini with a hydrogen-powered internal combustion engine was displayed at the Frankfurt auto show in 2001, and Ford has shown prototypes. BMW plans to offer a ''dual fuel'' 7 Series sedan, which could run on either gasoline or hydrogen, by 2008. That V-12 car would have a range of 125 miles on hydrogen and 185 on gasoline.</p>
