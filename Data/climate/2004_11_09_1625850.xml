        <p>Zepu Glacier in eastern Tibet is melting at record pace; runoff from Zepu, which has lost more than 100 yards of thickness over past three decades, has formed powerful new river; Dr Yao Tandong, China Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research director, and Ohio State University scientists led by geological science professor Dr Lonnie G Thompson hold that melting in Tibet is representative of glacial melt around world; experts assert that effects of warming will cause long-term threat of floods in low-lying areas, including New York City and Tokyo; photo; map (M)</p>

        <p>Seen from afar, it looked like much of the surrounding landscape, even to the scientists who know these Tibetan wilds intimately: the looming, massive, soot-black shoulder of a mountain.</p>
        <p>Close up, though, when one could finally see the base, all thick, glistening white ice, now clearly visible after nearly four hours of hiking through thick, pathless forests, there was no mistaking it.</p>
        <p>Mountains, after all, don't melt. This was the 27-square-mile glacier the researchers had been seeking.</p>
        <p>Pouring forth from the base of this huge mass of ice nearly 11,500 feet above sea level was a torrent of melting runoff that formed the powerful new headwaters of a mighty river -- an infant river, in geological time, already broad and raging from its first few yards.</p>
        <p>''Thirty years ago, there was no river here,'' said Dr. Yao Tandong, the director of China's Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, who has spent the last two decades on expeditions like these to study Tibetan glaciers. ''Of course, there has always been a river downstream, but up here, everything had always been frozen solid.''</p>
        <p>The glacier, named Zepu, has lost more than 100 yards of thickness, all in the last three decades, largely because of rising temperatures in the region. And it is hardly unique. Working with scientists from Ohio State University, Dr. Yao has documented similar losses all over Tibet, the largest and loftiest highlands on earth, and home to the biggest concentration of alpine glaciers anywhere.</p>
        <p>Nor are these changes limited to Tibet. ''Make no mistake, what's happening to the glaciers in Tibet is happening around the globe,'' said Dr. Lonnie G. Thompson, a professor of geological science at Ohio State. ''Our measurements show that between 1850 and 1960, the glaciers retreated 7.5 percent. Between 1960 and 2000, there was a further 7 percent retreat.</p>
        <p>''In the 1990's alone, the glaciers have shrunk by more than 4 percent.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Peter Clark, an Oregon State University geologist who specializes in glaciers and ice ages, agreed.</p>
        <p>''Glacial retreat, which is happening globally, with the exception of one area, in Scandinavia, is a pretty widely understood and accepted phenomenon,'' he said. ''Glaciers advance and retreat in response to two things, precipitation and temperature. Certainly by the standards of the last few thousand years, there has been a marked rise in temperature globally.''</p>
        <p>To be sure, there are vast stores of glacial ice left in Tibet. Flying into the province, a traveler passes over densely clustered ice-capped mountain ranges that dwarf the Alps, and ice fields that extend as far as the eye can see.</p>
        <p>But the dominant impression of a traveler who spent a week driving over 800 miles on the muddy back roads of eastern Tibet was of a world of water, not ice.</p>
        <p>Streaming white waterfalls fed by melting glaciers pour from mountains around every bend in some areas. Cliff-hugging roads are subject to mudslides and waterborne avalanches every few miles, and boulder-strewn whitewater rivers churn with uncommon ferocity.</p>
        <p>Dr. Thompson said he had documented large puddles of melting ice at 20,000 feet in the Himalayas, where for thousands of years all has been frozen.</p>
        <p>A craggy 56-year-old who says he has spent at least three years of his life at elevations of 18,000 feet or more researching glaciers, he spoke during a recent interview in Beijing. He had just completed the latest of many expeditions to Tibet over the last 20 years.</p>
        <p>The essence of his work involves retrieving deep ice samples, or cores, from glaciers.</p>
        <p>He spends much of his year like a migratory bird, traveling from one glacial mass to another, including the Himalayas and mountains in Peru, Kenya and Alaska.</p>
        <p>''When we go to retrieve a core, it's usually to a place that no one has ever been, and the beauty of ice, which is really different from any other material, is how much you can learn from it,'' he said. ''It tells you the history of precipitation, of dust accumulation and of wind strength. It also gives you a history of the atmosphere, including the presence of sulfates, nitrates and chlorides, which are precisely the factors associated with global warming.''</p>
        <p>In Peru, he said, the Quelccaya ice cap retreated a rate of more than 600 feet a year from 2000 to 2002 -- up from just 15 feet a year in the 1960's and 70's -- leaving a vast 80-foot-deep lake where none had existed when his studies began. On Kilimanjaro in Kenya, an 11,700-year-old ice cap that measured 4.3 square miles in 1912 had shrunk to 0.94 square miles in 2000, and is projected to disappear altogether in about 15 years.</p>
        <p>''When you see the big picture accumulating from many sites, the evidence of drastic climate change becomes quite compelling,'' Dr. Thompson said.</p>
        <p>Climate experts and geologists say the consequences of glacial ice melting on this scale are far-reaching. The most important long-term threat, perhaps, is to the low-lying coastal cities around the world -- places like New York and New Orleans, or Tokyo and Shanghai -- which could see more frequent flooding as a result of rising sea levels in this century.</p>
        <p>In other parts of the Himalayas, large newborn lakes are accumulating behind dams of ice that could break, unleashing deadly flash floods.</p>
        <p>For his part, Dr. Yao is unwilling to make sweeping predictions. Instead, fixing his gaze on the leading edge of the fast-melting Zepu glacier, he said, ''If you come back here in another 30 years, one thing is for sure: There will definitely be no more ice here.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  November 20, 2004, Saturday  An article in Science Times on Nov. 9 about the effects of global warming on glaciers and ice-capped mountains misstated the location of Kilimanjaro, where the ice cap has shrunk to less than a square mile from 4.3 square miles in 1912. It is in Tanzania, not Kenya.</p>
