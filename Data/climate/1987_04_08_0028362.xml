        <p>LEAD: PRESIDENT REAGAN's promises this week in Canada and his pledge last month to seek $2.5 billion for the development of commercial technologies to combat acid rain have generated a wave of excitement among researchers.</p>
        <p>PRESIDENT REAGAN's promises this week in Canada and his pledge last month to seek $2.5 billion for the development of commercial technologies to combat acid rain have generated a wave of excitement among researchers.</p>
        <p>The proposed financing would provide an opportunity for researchers to demonstrate the viability of a wide range of technologies designed to reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from power plants and other coal-burning sources.</p>
        <p>These pollutants combine with moisture in the air to form acid precipitation, which has been shown to destroy forests and lakes, both in the United States and Canada.</p>
        <p>The Department of Energy, which is coordinating the Government's efforts to develop new pollution-control devices, plans to build several test facilities where new clean-coal technologies can be demonstrated. Agency officials say that because there are so many different technologies to be evaluated it is much too early to tell which will prove most useful.</p>
        <p>''A lot will depend on what additional emission standards, if any, are imposed by Congress and how well a technology fits the space and production requirements of a particular plant,'' said Jack F. Siegel, the department's deputy assistant secretary for coal technology.</p>
        <p>There are three ways to reduce the environmental contaminants produced by burning high-sulfur coal: removing the sulfur from the coal before it is combusted, or burned; reducing the amount of pollutants produced during combustion, and removing the oxides from the flue gas after combustion takes place.</p>
        <p>A number of techniques involving these procedures are already gaining prominence among electric power companies and acid rain experts. Some include advanced coal-cleaning techniques, combustion modification, and flue gas treatments such as selective catalytic reduction. With recent improvements in design, even more costly methods such as flue gas scrubbers are under consideration, the experts said.</p>
        <p>The most common precombustion technologies include coal switching, in which high-sulfur coal is replaced with oil, gas or coal that has a lower sulfur content, and coal cleaning, in which coal is ground into small pieces to enable sulfur and other impurities to be washed out before it is burned.</p>
        <p>However, there are some drawbacks to current precombustion methods. Switching to low-sulfur coal or other fuels would displace thousands of miners. Also, current coal-cleaning techniques remove only a small portion, about 25 percent, of the sulfur from coal. For these reasons, researchers are developing more advanced ways to remove more sulfur from coal.</p>
        <p>Combustion modification, or decreasing the number of contaminants that are created in the burning, has been widely praised by the electric power industry as the best alternative for lowering nitrogen oxide emissions. In this method, the amount of fuel and air is carefully regulated to reduce the flame temperature and create a fuel-rich environment that reduces the oxidation of nitrogen in the fuel.</p>
        <p>The formation of nitrogen oxide depends heavily on the mixture of fuel and air, the temperature of the furnace, and the fluid dynamics of the furnace. In a fuel-rich environment there is less oxygen available to combine with the nitrogen. Most of the oxygen is used to burn the fuel.</p>
        <p>Nitrogen oxide emissions can also be suppressed by orchestrating combustion so that it occurs in several stages. The oxide that is created in one stage can be destroyed by adding additional fuel in another stage.</p>
        <p>By using combustion modification techniques, power plants can reduce their nitrogen oxide emissions by 50 percent to 60 percent, according to projections by Kurt Yeager, vice president of the Electric Power Research Institute, an industry research group in Palo Alto, Calif.</p>
        <p>''Our research shows that controlling the formation of contaminants is probably the most viable way of stopping acid rain,'' Mr. Yeager said.</p>
        <p>The alternative to combustion modification for controlling emissions of nitrogen oxide is to clean the flue gas before it leaves the smokestack. A procedure called selective catalytic reduction, which is widely used in Japan and West Germany, is now under consideration in the United States.</p>
        <p>In this technology the flue gas is mixed with ammonia and then passed through a catalytic chamber. In the chamber, the ammonia reduces the oxide to form nitrogen and water (steam), two harmless substances.</p>
        <p>Selected catalytic reduction can reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by up to 90 percent, according to Dr. F. Peter Boer, who heads the corporate technical group at W.R. Grace &amp; Company. However, the Electric Power Research Institute notes that the technology is expensive and that the catalysts might increase the formation of sulfur oxides when high-sulfur fuel is burned.</p>
        <p>Researchers at Grace began using this technology with its German partner, Feldmuehle, in 1984 after the German Government mandated control of such emissions from cars and plants.</p>
        <p>''A driving force in our decision to commercialize the technology in Germany was that it would prepare us to produce catalysts in the United States,'' Dr. Boer said. Grace, which is the leading producer of industrial catalysts, is developing the technology at its research facility in Columbia, Md., for use in United States power plants.</p>
        <p>Although still relatively expensive, flue gas scrubbing - one of the more traditional ways of removing sulfur dioxide from flue gas - is also being improved. In this method the flue gas is sprayed with a substance, such as limestone, that reacts with the sulfur dixode and converts it into solid waste. Because this waste is difficult to dispose of, researchers are devising new means to re-use it.</p>
        <p>There is a wide variety of other technologies being developed both in the United States and overseas. Under its clean coal project, the Energy Department is evaluating such procedures as pressurized fluid combustion, slagging combustion, gas reburning, induct injection, and multistage burning.</p>
        <p>The viability of these technologies will be determined only when they are demonstrated on a sufficient commercial scale. Utilities cannot afford to take the risks of proving their costs and reliability.</p>
        <p>''Everyone has their own opinion about what what's best to stop acid rain,'' said Mr. Siegel of the Energy Department. ''That's why we are supporting the development of a suite of technologies that will provide utilities with several options to meet their specific needs.''  BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY</p>
