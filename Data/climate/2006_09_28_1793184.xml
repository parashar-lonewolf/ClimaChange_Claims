        <p>LAST Sunday, as I walked through my woods in Maryland, I took note of the Japanese barberry beginning to show up beneath the oaks and sycamores.</p>
        <p>Japanese honeysuckle and multiflora rose are rampant there, too, of course.</p>
        <p>But now there are newcomers, like the shrubs linden viburnum (Viburnum dilatatum), so popular for its bright red berries, and Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia), whose silvery gray leaves and fragrant blossoms used to enchant me -- until I saw it fruiting, along with the linden, at the edge of the woods and in roadside ravines.</p>
        <p>I have nothing against exotic plants, but I would prefer that they not jump the garden fence. When a plant expands too forcefully, taking light, water and nutrients from less aggressive natives, I don't plant it in my garden.</p>
        <p>Yet what do I see when I go to my local nursery? Japanese barberry, half price, for fall planting. Winged euonymous, or burning bush, is another widely available, and often invasive, plant.</p>
        <p>There are reasons these plants are popular: they tend to be tough and easy to grow, and they thrive in degraded, compacted soil. Some, like barberry, are full of berries or seeds easily spread by birds and animals.</p>
        <p>Prolific seed production is one attribute of an invasive plant. But so is the ability to grow quickly, to leaf out early or to stay in leaf longer, any of which allows the plant to shade out others and gives it a competitive edge.</p>
        <p>A few native plants, like black locust, can be invasive. But native plants are usually kept in check by other native species, which have been their partners in evolution. Exotics, on the other hand, often have no predators or diseases to slow their spread.</p>
        <p>A new guide from the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, ''Native Alternatives to Invasive Plants,'' by C. Colston Burrell, published this month, clarifies why plants can be invasive in one area but not in another. (It is $8.95 at the botanic garden shop or by mail; bbg.org or 718-623-7286).</p>
        <p>Mr. Burrell, a landscape designer who also teaches about plants and ecology at the University of Virginia, champions native substitutes for barberry like New Jersey tea (Ceanothus americanus), a mounding shrub with clusters of white flowers in spring and golden foliage in fall, or Virginia sweetspire (Itea virginica), with fragrant white spires that bloom in midsummer and fall leaves that turn crimson, burgundy and purple.</p>
        <p>That doesn't mean he has no feeling for exotics. His garden, 16 miles northwest of Charlottesville, Va., is stuffed with hellebores, daphnes, viburnums and buddleia (butterfly bush), none of them native. But he keeps a close eye on anything that spreads.</p>
        <p>''We've known for years that buddleia is invasive in the Northwest, but it's also escaping quite a bit here,'' Mr. Burrell said. Its seed moves easily on wind and water, he said, and flourishes in very rocky soil, ''often out of cracks, railroad lines, industrial sites.''</p>
        <p>For East Coast gardeners, he suggests cephalanthus, or buttonbush, which has fragrant little fuzzy flowers; for those on the West Coast, Ceanothus thyrsiflorus, wild lilac, which has showy blue flowers. Both, like buddleia, are great butterfly attractors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burrell pointed out, to my surprise, that privet is also invasive, particularly in flood plains, from small streams to major rivers.</p>
        <p>''I've seen it spreading from the suburbs of Washington, D.C., on down to east-central Texas, where nothing else grows in the bottomlands for miles,'' he said. Linden viburnum, on the other hand, has found a very different niche, in mature beech forests.</p>
        <p>In place of linden viburnum, Mr. Burrell suggests red chokeberry (Aronia arbutifolia), which has white flowers in spring and red berries that persist through winter. If it is planted in the sun, its leaves turn a spectacular fiery orange-red in the fall. Or he recommends scarlet elder, Sambucus racemosa var. racemosa (pubens), which bears creamy yellow flowers in spring and scarlet berries in fall.</p>
        <p>Despite its reasonable tone, ''Native Alternatives to Invasive Plants'' raises a red flag for Peter Del Tredici, a botanist and senior scientist at the Arnold Arboretum in Jamaica Plain, Mass., who argues that tough exotic plants are the perfect denizens of the urban environment, which has been so disturbed that it has no natural ecosystem.</p>
        <p>Euonymus and berberis (Japanese barberry) ''are the parking lot plants par excellence,'' said Mr. Del Tredici, who teaches about plants and ecology at Harvard.</p>
        <p>''If you compact the soil,'' he said, ''all you can really grow is euonymus.''</p>
        <p>So-called natural woodlands, he added, have had centuries of disturbance from logging. And native plants have been hurt by pests, acid rain and the warming of temperatures. The invasives, he said, have moved into the void and flourished.</p>
        <p>''They are symptoms of environmental degradation,'' he said. ''But I call it blaming the victim.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Del Tredici is not against removing invasive species that are threatening a rare species in some natural area and replacing them with natives. But pulling invasives out of parks, he argues, is going against evolution. ''Trying to hold onto something that no longer exists -- 'The way God created it in 1492 is the way it should stay' -- well, that isn't possible,'' he said. ''So why even make it a goal?''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Burrell argues that even places that are not truly wild have a plant history that means something and should be preserved.</p>
        <p>''I remember the forest before these invasives,'' he said. ''So as long as there's a collective memory of what used to be, most people aren't willing to go watch a flood plain of Virginia bluebells and spring beauties turn into a monoculture of privet.''</p>
        <p>Many states now list plants that are invasive to their areas, and some are moving to ban the propagation and sale of specific plants. Purple loosestrife, for example, will be banned in Minnesota by 2009.</p>
        <p>Winged euonymus (Euonymus alatus), Mr. Burrell noted, is spreading from New Hampshire to Michigan, south to the Carolinas and Tennessee, west to Iowa and Montana.</p>
        <p>''It's time for nurseries to stop selling these plants,'' he said.</p>
