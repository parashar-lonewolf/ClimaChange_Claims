        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''The Trouble With Harriet'' (editorial, Oct. 20):</p>
        <p>The trouble with Harriet E. Miers is George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>Ms. Miers was having a nice, if undistinguished, life as White House counsel when the president looked into her heart and saw a new way to promote cronyism in his administration.</p>
        <p>This is a president so out of touch with reality that on one occasion he says he has no litmus test for judges and on another, says she is a deeply religious person.</p>
        <p>I have no problem with people's being deeply religious or loyal, but when it comes to putting them on the Supreme Court (or FEMA or the Department of Health and Human Services and so on), I want them to be qualified.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has already made a mockery of the presidency by attacking Iraq under false pretenses and by questioning the existence of global warming.</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court is where a line in the sand must be drawn by the Senate.</p>
