        <p>Tropical storms sometimes bring more rainfall and deadlier floods to a given place than their bigger and more violent brothers and sisters, hurricanes. Tropical Storm Alberto, whose remnants unloosed record rains and raging floodwaters on parts of Georgia in the last few days, is a classic case.</p>
        <p>But there has also been another important contributor to Georgia's weather problems, a big high-pressure system over the Atlantic Ocean, the same "Bermuda high" responsible for this week's heat and humidity in New York and much of the East.</p>
        <p>And the Bermuda high, in turn, is a first cousin to two other, similar systems that created record-high temperatures of 120 degrees and more in parts of the Southwest in June, and unusually high temperatures in comparable latitudes of India and Pakistan in late May and early June.</p>
        <p>The events in Georgia, the Southwest and the Indian subcontinent all serve to extend a global pattern of unusually extreme weather that climatologists say has developed in the 1980's and 90's, a pattern for which the scientists have no sure or ready explanations.</p>
        <p>Tropical storms, which essentially are weaker versions of hurricanes, have a history of bringing devastating rains to areas around the Gulf of Mexico, said Frederick J. Gadomski, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University's Weather Communications Group. The main reason is that such storms tend to move more slowly, remaining over a given area longer and thus dropping more rain there. While their winds are not as high or destructive as those of hurricanes, they can contain as much moisture.</p>
        <p>Tropical Storm Alberto fit this pattern perfectly after making landfall last Sunday. It moved northward across the Florida Panhandle and into Georgia at about 10 miles an hour. The big Bermuda high prevented the storm from being picked up by prevailing west-to-east winds, Mr. Gadomski said. As a result, he added, it "got caught in an atmospheric backwater" and could not move out.</p>
        <p>Thus, the storm set what may be a state record for rainfall in a 24-hour period: more than 21 inches in Americus, Ga.</p>
        <p>The Bermuda high is part of a band of more or less permanent high-pressure systems girdling the globe at about 25 degrees to 35 degrees north latitude. This band of high pressure is particularly apt to bring hot weather at this time of year, when the sun's rays are strongest in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
        <p>Another segment of the band was responsible for record high temperatures of 120 degrees or more in Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona and Nevada in June. While it is still unusually hot there, temperatures have been moderated by a flow of moist, cooling air from the Pacific -- a monsoonal flow typical of this time of year.</p>
        <p>In late May and early June, the Indo-Pakistani high inflicted temperatures of more than 120 degrees on that part of the world. While temperatures above 100 are common there at that time of the year, New Delhi recorded its highest temperatures in half a century.</p>
        <p>Why did the heat waves persist so long? "Those are unanswerable questions of the global atmospheric circulation," Mr. Gadomski said .</p>
        <p>Some scientists believe that the big floods and more frequent droughts and violent storms of the last few years may be traceable to a slight warming of the global temperature, whether natural or induced by atmospheric accumulations of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide. Others believe the warming has played no role, while still others say there is simply no way to know.</p>
        <p>Whatever the ultimate cause, changes in weather patterns are believed to be mediated primarily by changes in ocean currents and temperatures, but scientists are only beginning to learn about them.</p>
        <p>"If we understood how the ocean currents behave more completely," Mr. Gadomski said, "we'd be able to understand these atmospheric effects that persist for weeks, months or years."</p>
