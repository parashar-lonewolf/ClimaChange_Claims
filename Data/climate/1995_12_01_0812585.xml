        <p>After intensive review, a United Nations panel of experts yesterday confirmed its conclusion that human activity is likely to be at least partly responsible for the changing climate.</p>
        <p>"The balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate," the science working group of the Intergovernmental Panel on  Climate Change said, endorsing preliminary findings made in earlier draft reports.</p>
        <p>The average global surface temperature has risen by about 1 degree Fahrenheit in the last century. In its first full assessment five years ago, the panel said the warming was as likely to have resulted from natural causes as from emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide released by the burning of coal, oil and wood.</p>
        <p>Yesterday the group also forecast that the average global temperature would rise between 1.8 degrees and 6.3 degrees -- with a "best estimate" of 3.6 degrees -- by 2100 if no action to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases is taken.</p>
        <p>The "best estimate" is about a third lower than that forecast five years ago, the group said, largely because the climatic effect of sulfate aerosols -- tiny  droplets of sulfur emitted by industry that cool the atmosphere by reflecting sunlight -- has now been taken into account. In some regions, these aerosols more than offset the warming caused by heat-trapping greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the predicted warming could cause widespread climatic disruption.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's report, issued at a meeting in Madrid, emphasized that much uncertainty remains, not least scientists' inability to say whether human activity is responsible for a little of the warming to date or a lot. The uncertainty stems mainly from the imperfections of computer models of the atmosphere. Experts agree, for instance, that the models do not yet reflect the  climate system's natural variability very well.</p>
        <p>But the panel said the models have demonstrated "increasing realism" and have "increased our confidence in their use for projection of future climate change."</p>
        <p>Model studies of the warming trend have shown that it is "unlikely to be entirely natural in origin," the panel said. More convincing, it reported, are more recent studies that compare the highly idiosyncratic patterns of warming and cooling over recent decades with those that, according to the models, should be produced by the combined effect of increasing greenhouse gases and aerosols.</p>
        <p>A correspondence has been found between what the models say should have occurred and the observed changes in temperature. The panel said the likelihood  that the correspondence could occur by chance is "very low."</p>
        <p>The panel also reduced by about a quarter its earlier estimate of the rise in the sea level that is expected to result from a warming atmosphere. Still, the group said, the average global sea level will rise between 6 and 37 inches by 2100, with a best estimate of about 20 inches. The rise would be higher in some  places and lower in others, and it would continue after 2100, the panel said.</p>
        <p>Another working group dealing with climate change has said up to 70 million people living in coastal areas could be put at risk.</p>
        <p>The working group on the impact of climate change said earlier that the predicted warming could bring an increase in heat waves, fires and pest outbreaks in some regions; cause entire forest types to disappear; make desert climates more extreme; increase the number of heat-related deaths and illnesses, and expand the range of animal-borne infectious diseases like malaria, yellow fever and encephalitis.</p>
