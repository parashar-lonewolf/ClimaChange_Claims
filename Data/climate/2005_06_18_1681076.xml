        <p>Drafts of a joint statement being prepared for the leaders of the major industrial powers show that the Bush administration has succeeded in removing language calling for prompt action to control global warming.</p>
        <p>The statement is being negotiated in advance of the annual Group of 8 summit, which is to be held in Scotland next month. Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, president of the group this year, has sought to focus the summit on aid to Africa and on climate change.</p>
        <p>The statement, first outlined last month by British officials, is meant to reflect the eight countries' shared concerns and plans regarding climate change. Drafts have been batted back and forth since mid-May.</p>
        <p>A newly disclosed version, the first showing specifically what changes were sought by the Bush administration, was provided to The New York Times on Friday by someone in Europe involved with shaping the British stance on the issue.</p>
        <p>It is dated May 27, and the revisions, many of which are also reflected in a June 14 version, vividly illustrate the broad gulf between the United States and the group's other members: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and Russia.</p>
        <p>Several other drafts, showing changes but not indicating which countries sought them, have been released by environmental groups over the last few weeks. The June 14 draft was described in the European news media earlier in the week and in The Washington Post on Friday.</p>
        <p>Among the changes reflected in the May 27 draft was the deletion of an introductory statement, ''Our world is warming.'' The annotated American copy of the document also offered comments to negotiators for the other nations like ''we should avoid the term 'targets''' and ''we should leave the definition of what constitutes 'ambitious' to each leader, given their respective national circumstances.''</p>
        <p>Steve Sawyer, the climate-policy director for Greenpeace International, said the British might have erred in trying to use a forum like the Group of 8 to seek movement from President Bush on this issue.</p>
        <p>''We've been telling them since last September, at least, that it's a laudable goal but don't build your strategy for the G-8 on the odds of the U.S. moving, because the odds are vanishingly small,'' Mr. Sawyer said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has said global warming is too uncertain a matter to justify anything more than voluntary measures to slow growth in fossil-fuel emissions.</p>
