        <p>Diplomatic news from nowhere.</p>
        <p>In a dramatic shift of rhetoric, if not policy, President Kim Jong Il announced today that North Korea would no longer refer to the United States as ''the imperialist aggressor.''</p>
        <p>After years of cold-war tensions and suspicion, he declared that the United States would henceforth be known as a ''superpower of concern.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kim disclosed the change in North Korea's diplomatic lexicon in an interview with the National Public Radio host Diane Rehm, who asked if last month's remarkable summit between Mr. Kim and President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea portended a warming of relations with the United States.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kim's aides, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said North Korea was still ''concerned'' by American policies, namely the construction of a $60 billion missile defense aimed at the North. But they expressed hope that it would encourage the tentative diplomatic contacts the Clinton administration has pursued in recent years.</p>
        <p>North Korea's gesture came a week after Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright announced a similar shift in American diplomatic language. On the same radio program, Dr. Albright disclosed that the State Department had officially purged the phrase ''rogue states'' and would now call America's international gallery of rogues -- North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Libya and sometimes Cuba, Syria and the Sudan -- by the admittedly clunky phrase ''states of concern.''</p>
        <p>It remains to be seen whether Dr. Albright's gesture will open a new era of diplomacy, but already there have been signs of global warming. In the days after her announcement, President Fidel Castro of Cuba declared that he would stop regularly calling Americans ''Yanqui imperialistas.'' Instead, he said he would call the United States ''the superpower whose cold-war mentality allows me to justify a repressive regime.''</p>
        <p>Iran's moderate president, Mohammad Khatami, said the United States was no longer officially ''the Great Satan,'' and the official Iraqi news agency announced that it would stop calling American and British warplanes that patrol the nation's skies ''enemy crows'' and instead refer to them as ''birds who have deviated from their migratory paths.''</p>
        <p>Others, including some allies, seemed less inclined to tinker with the language of diplomacy. France insisted it would continue calling the United States a ''hyperpower.''</p>
        <p>''Rogue states'' is not the first diplomatic moniker to fall out of use, of course. The end of the cold war spelled doom for a raft of nasty-sounding labels like Iron Curtain, Evil Empire, Free World and third world, nonaligned, pariah states and Red China.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Albright's move appeared to be the first deliberate effort to change the diplomatic lexicon in pursuit of foreign policy goals.</p>
        <p>James P. Rubin, the former spokesman for Dr. Albright, said the categorization of problem countries as rogue states had initially served as an effective way to make sense of the increasingly complex geopolitics after the fall of the Soviet Union. Rogue states were those that, in the American view, sponsored terrorism or pursued weapons of mass destruction.</p>
        <p>But with some of those formerly rogue states taking steps to act in good faith, it was important not to allow colorful language to stand in the way of diplomatic progress.</p>
        <p>''When the United States speaks, the world listens,'' Mr. Rubin said. ''So it matters what language the United States uses.''</p>
