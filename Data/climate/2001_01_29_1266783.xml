        <p>Ready or not, the Bush administration is going to find itself dealing with challenges to American safety and well-being that were not considered serious security threats during the last Republican administration eight years ago. Familiar issues like terrorism and nuclear proliferation now must share the foreign policy agenda with threats that carry no weapons. Environmental damage, water shortages, mass movements of refugees, overpopulation, infectious diseases and even third-world poverty all affect American security. Some of these problems can intrude on our soil. But all can lead to the kind of instability and conflict that has frequently warranted American intervention.</p>
        <p>Disease is the most immediate problem, and the one most likely to affect Americans directly. The world's poorest people are suffering from new diseases such as AIDS, more virulent strains of old sicknesses such as drug-resistant tuberculosis and an increase in illnesses once thought to be under control, such as malaria. Germs and viruses easily emigrate by plane. In the early 1990's, it cost $1 billion to eradicate 1,000 cases of resistant tuberculosis in New York City.</p>

        <p>Ready or not, the Bush administration is going to find itself dealing with challenges to American safety and well-being that were not considered serious security threats during the last Republican administration eight years ago. Familiar issues like terrorism and nuclear proliferation now must share the foreign policy agenda with threats that carry no weapons. Environmental damage, water shortages, mass movements of refugees, overpopulation, infectious diseases and even third-world poverty all affect American security. Some of these problems can intrude on our soil. But all can lead to the kind of instability and conflict that has frequently warranted American intervention.</p>
        <p>Disease is the most immediate problem, and the one most likely to affect Americans directly. The world's poorest people are suffering from new diseases such as AIDS, more virulent strains of old sicknesses such as drug-resistant tuberculosis and an increase in illnesses once thought to be under control, such as malaria. Germs and viruses easily emigrate by plane. In the early 1990's, it cost $1 billion to eradicate 1,000 cases of resistant tuberculosis in New York City.</p>
        <p>Over the next 10 years, AIDS is likely to cripple the economies of many nations in sub-Saharan Africa. Millions of orphans are growing up on the streets. Entire countries may come to the brink of collapse as they lose their most economically active people. Waves of refugees could destabilize neighboring nations.</p>
        <p>Overpopulation and environmental devastation have already contributed to similar situations on a smaller scale. The Clinton administration intervened in Haiti largely to prevent a flood of new refugees in Florida. Haiti's criminal leadership was the immediate cause of the problem, but the country's rapid rates of population growth and deforestation contributed to its misery and the desire of Haitians to flee. Similar problems fueled conflict in Somalia, Rwanda and other countries.</p>
        <p>Since it is difficult to arouse sufficient interest in these problems before they become catastrophes, Washington has normally waited until a crisis develops before taking action. George W. Bush would be well served to invest in alleviating problems before they require large infusions of money or even the introduction of American military forces.</p>
        <p>Washington, for example, should help rebuild the health system in Russia, which now has one of the world's fastest-growing rates of H.I.V. infection and an epidemic of drug-resistant tuberculosis. Mr. Bush should also treat AIDS in Africa as a security threat. The United Nations estimates that it would take $1.5 billion to institute effective prevention campaigns all over Africa, and the same amount to care for AIDS patients and their orphans. Health officials believe that AIDS can be treated in Africa with the same medicines Americans get if the West helps pay. Working with European nations on these problems now could save millions of lives and billions of dollars later.</p>
        <p>The Bush administration could also help prevent future problems by endorsing the 1997 Kyoto accord on greenhouse gases. An authoritative report has concluded that man-made gases contributed substantially to the rise in temperature over the last 50 years. Global warming, many experts believe, has led to devastating floods and hurricanes in tropical areas, and could eventually produce drought in America's breadbasket. Mr. Bush and Republicans in Congress must balance their desire to protect the profits of American businesses with a determination to set emission and other environmental standards that reduce the production of harmful gases.</p>
        <p>Dealing with problems like disease and environmental destruction will require foresight, creativity and a willingness to take political risks. They are often called ''soft'' security threats, but today they can pose a greater worldwide danger than anything that comes from the barrel of a gun.</p>
