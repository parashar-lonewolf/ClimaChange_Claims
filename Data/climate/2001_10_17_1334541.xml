        <p>President Bush's trip to China tomorrow to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting may mark a qualitatively new and more mature phase in relations between the two countries. The current campaign against global terrorism, in which the two governments have already cooperated extensively, offers the opportunity to improve a relationship that has been plagued by difficulties.</p>
        <p>Normally a presidential visit to China would generate strong passions and public controversy in the United States, as China has been a lightning rod in American domestic political debates. Disagreements about China policy inside the government, which have often been heated since 1989, have become muted.</p>
        <p>The principal reason for the lack of controversy is that America and the world are preoccupied by the events of Sept. 11 and the unfolding American-led military campaign in Afghanistan. This lack of attention may be just what the relationship between America and China needs, providing an opportunity for President Bush and President Jiang Zemin of China to meet without strong domestic pressures and heightened international expectations. Simply going to Shanghai will also help familiarize President Bush with the realities of a rapidly modernizing China, giving him a concrete sense of a country often reduced to abstractions and stereotypes.</p>
        <p>This first meeting between Mr.  Bush and Mr. Jiang provides a chance for the two to stake out mutual interests in the campaign against terrorism as well as to manage other difficult issues, including the spread of weapons of mass destruction, climate change, organized crime and narcotics smuggling, and the future of North Korea.</p>
        <p>China's hosting of the APEC conference and imminent entry into the World Trade Organization in early November are also important events in their own right, and tangibly symbolize China's integration into the global economy. In this context, the tensions of recent years between Washington and Beijing may be reduced by multinational management of common problems. Although the two nations will continue to have friction, international coalitions and multilateral mechanisms offer a productive way forward for Sino-American cooperation.</p>
        <p>Since President Nixon's opening to China three decades ago, American policy has sought China's integration into the international community. Encouraging Chinese membership in, and compliance with, international institutions has been viewed as important for global stability. Yet China has long suspected multilateral institutions of being stalking horses for American interests.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, this view has recently been reversed; China now believes that such institutions may constrain American power or, at the least, keep the United States from acting unilaterally.</p>
        <p>Although China is regarded as a full member of the global system, this integration remains more form than substance. China's ambivalence even now about multilateralism and Beijing's selective implementation of international agreements indicate that China is not fully comfortable with the aims, principles and norms that underlie global institutions. China's commitment to the international system needs to be judged by the consistency of its actions.</p>
        <p>The international effort to restrict the proliferation of sensitive military technologies is one particularly thorny area that has long roiled Sino-American relations. Last November, Beijing formally committed to Washington that it would curb its exports of missile components and nuclear technology. This important agreement was reciprocated by a Clinton administration decision to  make it easier for American companies to launch satellites on Chinese rockets. But last month the State Department slapped sanctions on two Chinese companies accused of circumventing the pledge to curb missile exports by transferring missile parts to Pakistan.</p>
        <p>The Chinese government faces a choice. It can either continue selling nuclear technology and missile components, for example, to unstable states like Pakistan or hostile ones like Iran, or it can live up to its commitments and gain international acceptance as a responsible state. In our discussions in Beijing last week with military officials and civilian analysts, it was apparent that Chinese arms control authorities are rethinking China's approach. China cannot be against terrorism one day and selling dangerous technology to states that sponsor terrorism the next. The incentives now clearly cut in favor of Chinese compliance with multilateral nonproliferation norms. Mr. Bush and Mr. Jiang may announce progress on this issue when they meet in Shanghai on Friday.</p>
        <p>The mixed, complex character of Sino-American relations resists reduction to any simplistic slogan, whether ''strategic partners'' or ''strategic competitors.'' America's relationship with China is increasingly enmeshed in a broader global framework. Of course, some Sino-American problems -- Taiwan and missile defense, for example -- are not amenable to multilateral management. But China's increased participation in global organizations may well improve the way our two nations handle this always fraught relationship.</p>
