        <p>From the purple-carpeted lounges that looked out over the International Housewares Show at McCormick Place here you could see an ocean of wicker and neon. There were mirrored renditions of Malcolm X, Elvis and puppies. There were inflatable clocks, flashlight-shaped "personal alarms," cloth sacks made specifically for kittens to play in, miniature teak furniture, contraptions that bake waffles in the shape of Bugs Bunny, electric wands that dehumidify closets, and companies with names like Mr. Ice Bucket, Warp Brothers and Love Mug Inc.</p>
        <p>When it comes to churning out gadgets and novelties, there is nothing more prolific than the housewares industry. For the last 53 years, marketers of ergonomic cheese cutters, flashing dog collars and the like have gravitated to this show to display their goods.

        <p>From the purple-carpeted lounges that looked out over the International Housewares Show at McCormick Place here you could see an ocean of wicker and neon. There were mirrored renditions of Malcolm X, Elvis and puppies. There were inflatable clocks, flashlight-shaped "personal alarms," cloth sacks made specifically for kittens to play in, miniature teak furniture, contraptions that bake waffles in the shape of Bugs Bunny, electric wands that dehumidify closets, and companies with names like Mr. Ice Bucket, Warp Brothers and Love Mug Inc.</p>
        <p>When it comes to churning out gadgets and novelties, there is nothing more prolific than the housewares industry. For the last 53 years, marketers of ergonomic cheese cutters, flashing dog collars and the like have gravitated to this show to display their goods. It is all the more curious, then, that at this year's exhibition age-old products and Depression-era designs were touted as the industry's cutting edge.</p>
        <p>The four-day show, which opened today, is no modest affair. Its 2,000 exhibits cover more than 17 acres of the McCormick Place complex and are expected to draw 55,000 visitors from 70 countries.</p>
        <p>But what struck its organizers was that, at an exhibition that once introduced the food processor and the ultrasonic humidifier, the hottest items of 1992 were low-tech basics.</p>
        <p>Consider, for example, Hot-Line's Presawash, an aluminum-barrel washing machine that runs on nothing more than two quarts of hot water, a teaspoon of soap powder and half a dozen turns of a crank.</p>
        <p>At the Hot-Line booth, a heavy-set Australian named Arthur Peart demonstrated how the Presawash worked on a variety of grotesquely stained shirts. Mystified passers-by who stopped to ask why the "butter churn" was so large were surprised less than a minute later to see Mr. Peart draw out a spotless shirt, followed by a pitcherful of what looked and smelled like strong coffee.</p>
        <p>The 20-inch-high container works on basic principles of steam pressure, Mr. Peart said. As the sealed tank tumbles slowly on its A-frame stand, the expansion of the vapor from the hot water inside forces dirt out of the clothes' fibers. Because so little soap is used and the washing time is so short, he said, the $80 device is ideal for delicates and shirts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Peart insisted that despite its modest appearance the Presawash is the result of years of development. "When I took this up in 1973, it was just a tin bucket," he said. "But because it relies on the physics of pressure and not on any power source, it has to be this design and these materials, just so. It's simple, sure, but with a half-twist."</p>
        <p>A few freshly carpeted miles away (40,000 square yards of carpet are installed for the exhibition, to be taken up afterward), the president of Back to Basics Products, a Utah concern, was also turning a wooden crank. Surrounded by steam canners, ice shavers and dough mixers, Bill Beesley 3d peeled apples on a $30 device of stainless steel and cast iron called the Peel Away.</p>
        <p>"Salt Lake City, the place where I come from, is really the food storage capital of the world," said Mr. Beesley, a slim, bespectacled man with a shaved head and an operatic laugh. "I know people who pack away whole garages of food. They could live off their stores for years and years."</p>
        <p>After several turns of the viselike instrument's grooved shaft, Mr. Beesley presented a meticulously peeled and cored apple. "People want to be financially and physically prepared, you see," Mr. Beesley said. "Prepared for the continued eroding of our way of life."</p>
        <p>Lounging nearby, an exhibitor named James Sachs was also trying to make sense of it all. "It's like this," said Mr. Sachs, vice president of sales and marketing for Atlantic Cheinco Corporation of New Jersey. "Folks at General Motors thought they'd be protected for the rest of their lives, but now people are figuring out that they'd better start looking after themselves. Everybody here is aware of that."</p>
        <p>As Mr. Sachs spoke, an Atlantic Cheinco employee dressed as Benjamin Franklin walked around the booth, straightening decorative tins that bore logos of The Old Farmer's Almanac and Clifford the Dog.</p>
        <p>"Nobody wants to think about drive-by shootings," Mr. Sachs added as the Franklin impersonator stepped across the aisle to introduce himself to a woman dressed as a Barbie doll. "They want the security of their memories."</p>
        <p>Of course, in a show whose displays alone accounted for 2,000 tons of incoming freight, every product type had its opposite. For every snap-style mousetrap, ash-wood basket and stove-top percolator that rode the atavistic "new" wave, there was a genuinely new contraption.</p>
        <p>Take for instance the Open Up, a "power twist jar and bottle opener" sold by Appliance Science Corporation of South Norwalk, Conn. The $35 Open Up is an inverted plastic cone whose inner surface is covered with thin strips of steel, not unlike the metal on a wood rasp. When a bottle is pushed up into the device, the cone turns slowly to twist open the cap. Battery powered and mounted under a cabinet, it fits any cap from half an inch to four inches in diameter.</p>
        <p>"This was invented by an Illinois farmer whose wife had arthritis," said Sallie Kreda, an Appliance Science spokeswoman, while a man dressed as Snoopy brushed past, ambling toward an exhibit in which a woman in a bathing suit showered on demand. "Most of the innovations are simply improvements on exisiting designs. Teal blue popcorn makers. That sort of thing."</p>
        <p>Well past the World of Shoeshines, where a quartet of men in tuxedos served a bank of eight extremely popular chairs, a trio of women demonstrated the Minute Marinizer, a $179 appliance made by Upscale Products that marinates any food placed under its plastic dome in a mere three minutes.</p>
        <p>"The machine creates a slight vacuum," said the leader, Ramona Cox, a co-owner of Upscale, as she set onion halves into a dish of beet-red liquid under the machine's cover. "Air evacuates the food, and liquid chases in to fill the gap."</p>
        <p>Sure enough, after a series of whirring noises from the machine and a belligerent snap as the vacuum seal was broken, the food had soaked up enough of the bright fluid to give it a slightly unearthly appearance. A small crowd stared in silence at the florid onion as Miss Cox explained: "The onion is like a meat, do you see? Now you can use less tender cuts."</p>
        <p>The show's newfangled inventory didn't stop there. There were portable soda fountains that run on syrup cartridges, carbon dioxide and ice; palette-and-blade kits for decorating watermelons much as you might a pumpkin; Goofy Graffiti, a disappearing spray that, marketers promised, leaves no lasting impressions, and even tiny plastic stands for holding half-empty bottles upside-down in the refrigerator.</p>
        <p>"What you're looking at here is classic technology with a difference," said Pat Terry, a spokeswoman for the National Housewares Manufacturers Association, which sponsored the show. "People may want to make their own bread, but they're not going to spend their lives in the kitchen. Technology's giving us shortcuts to the old-fashioned rewards."</p>
        <p>And the old-fashioned pleasures, apparently. Just ask Ron Gordon, whose eponymous company in Paterson, N.J., does a brisk trade in handpainted bamboo bird cages. Mr. Gordon, wearing a sky-blue velour sweatshirt, cradled an artificial goldfinch in both hands, and gingerly held it out in front of him.</p>
        <p>"It's plastic, with a layer of genuine duck feathers," Mr. Gordon said. "Then it's handpainted, and the wire feet are attached. There's even a microchip inside so that when you clap or touch the cage, it'll chirp for you."</p>
        <p>"People are getting back to nature," he said conclusively, sticking a paper wedge back into a slot in the bird's belly to keep it from singing. "That's what it's all about."</p>
