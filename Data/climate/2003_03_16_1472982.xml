        <p>EIGHT men sat back to back at two adjoining booths on the 7:30 a.m. ferry to Bridgeport on March 7, keeping to themselves, speaking quietly in deep voices, like guests at a funeral. These weather-beaten, solid-looking men, with thick, calloused hands and heavy clothing made for outdoor work, plainly were not part of the crowd of commuters and casino day-trippers.</p>
        <p>They were lobstermen, and they were on their way to another scientific dissection of an event that has threatened their livelihoods: the still-mysterious die-off of lobsers in Long Island Sound that began in 1999.</p>
        <p>''Most of the guys haven't checked their gear for months -- there's nothing to check,'' said George Dahl, chairman of the New York Lobster Conservation Management Team and vice president of the Long Island Sound Lobstermen's Association. The cold winter had covered many harbors with ice, he said, making it impossible for many lobstermen to get to their traps.</p>
        <p>John Davi, 39, a lobsterman from Port Jefferson who sails out of Mount Sinai, said that between late September and the end of last year he lost money every time he took out his boat, at a cost of $600 a day for bait, fuel and labor. ''Things were good five years ago,'' he said. ''We lost a lot of lobsters.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dahl, a 57-year-old Northport resident, said that when he last checked 400 of his 2,000 traps in December, his catch was a mere 25 lobsters. ''How much money can you afford to lose before you stop?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>So Mr. Dahl and his colleagues had plenty of time to go to Bridgeport for the third annual lobster health symposium, sponsored by the Sea Grant Projects of New York and Connecticut, to hear the scientists report on their latest attempts to find out why the Sound's lobsters have been dying.</p>
        <p>For centuries, lobstering was a profitable occupation in the Sound. Local lobstermen grew up working as mates on family-owned boats before becoming captains of their own vessels. That traditional way of life suffered a shock in the fall of 1999 when, almost overnight, more than 90 percent of the lobsters hauled up in the western Sound were dead.</p>
        <p>''It was the strangest thing,'' said Joe Finke, president of the Western Long Island Sound Lobstermen's Association. ''They looked perfectly healthy when we hauled them up, but a lot of them were dead.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Finke, 47, who lives in Bayville and sails out of Glen Cove, recalled packing the few healthy lobsters for market, only to receive a call from the wholesaler in Point Lookout saying all of the shipment was dead on arrival.</p>
        <p>Lobster landings in the Sound, reported at 10.4 million pounds in 1998 by the New York Department of Environmental Conservation and the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, dropped to 3.6 million pounds in 2000. After a slight decline in 2001, last year's harvest plunged again, to an estimated 2.5 million pounds.</p>
        <p>''Until September of last year, we were having a fair year,'' said John German, 55, president of the Long Island Lobstermen's Association. ''Then in September-October, there was a major die-off. This year, I'd predict a couple of hundred thousands pounds, if that. The lowest ever.''</p>
        <p>''If the lobsters don't show up by May, a lot of guys will pack it in,'' said Mr. German, who sails out of Mount Sinai and lives in Brookhaven. ''Next year's figures will really tell the tale.''</p>
        <p>The die-off has already proved fatal to many lobstermen's livelihoods. ''We've had three years to adjust, but the loss is never going to pass,'' said Mr. Finke, who now charters his boat to scientists from the New York Sea Grant Project to haul traps for lab research.</p>
        <p>Lobstering, a cash business, is part of the underground economy. Lobstermen are close-mouthed about their income, which makes it hard to get accurate estimates of their financial losses. But in 1997 there were 888 licensed lobstermen in New York State. By 2001, the last year for which complete figures are available, the number had dropped to 600. In Connecticut, the 1998 total was 538, and in 2002 it was 414.</p>
        <p>As the ferry docked in Bridgeport, the lobstermen looked as if they were being forced to spend Thanksgiving with relatives they didn't like. ''These meetings are useless,'' said Mr. Dahl, for whom a satisfying day's work used to mean standing on the pitching steel deck of his boat and hauling in several hundred wire traps filled with mud-covered sea life that might or might not include lobsters. On a good day, Mr. Dahl would bring home as much as 700 pounds of the Sound's most profitable shellfish.</p>
        <p>For the lobstermen, there is little love lost between them and the scientists. The prevalent view is that the academics depend on the lobster die-off for their research funds and are in no rush to restore the resource. Mr. Dahl contends that none of the money spent on experiments is helping the lobstermen or bringing back the lobsters.</p>
        <p>''In 2001, at the first forum, the scientists said they had to use us in their research because we had knowledge of the resource,'' he said. ''They got their money, and then they wanted nothing to do with us.''</p>
        <p>Nick Crismali, president of the Connecticut Lobstermen's Association, expressed a similar point of view. ''There are a lot of bean counters here, but the fishermen are suffering,'' said a Mr. Crismali, 52, of Guilford. ''I'm just interested in knowing where your program is going now that the fishermen are disappearing.''</p>
        <p>Carl LoBue of the New York D.E.C. responded, ''We recognize that if it wasn't for fishermen, we wouldn't be in this room.'' But neither Mr. LoBue nor the four scientists who presented findings on environmental stresses, physiological responses to stress, parasites and pesticides could predict when the situation would improve, and none had an explanation for the disaster that satisfied the lobstermen. For example, all Carmela Cuomo, a geology professor at Yale, could say was that ''something funky is going on in September and October.''</p>
        <p>Alistair Dove, a senior research associate at the Cornell College of Veterinary Medicine who runs a shellfish pathology lab at Stony Brook University, reported on a fatal disease called calcinosis found in 20 lobsters analyzed from August to October last year. Calcinosis, in which stony deposits form in the lobster's gills, causing respiratory failure, is caused by excess calcium. This was the first time this disease has shown up in Long Island Sound lobsters.</p>
        <p>Dr. Dove, a 29-year-old Coram resident, hypothesized that warm water temperatures during the summers of 2001 and 2002 stressed the lobsters' immune systems so that they were vulnerable to infection. Further, the warm water created favorable conditions for paramoebas and parasites.</p>
        <p>Whether they are just a natural variation or a sign of global warming, higher water temperatures are beyond the control of those who live near the Sound or make a living on it. But Dr. Dove was not ready to discount pollution as a factor. ''Paramoebae and parasites can have a role,'' he said. ''Pesticides could be a factor. It can easily be a multifactorial problem.''</p>
        <p>The most hotly debated topic pertaining to the die-off is whether it was caused by pesticides sprayed against mosquitoes in 1999, then washed into the Sound a few days after Hurricane Floyd swept through.</p>
        <p>Jack Mattice, 61, director of the New York Sea Grant program in Riverhead, doubts that pesticides were to blame. ''The lobsters started dying before the first pesticides were sprayed in 1999,'' Mr. Mattice said.</p>
        <p>He also argued that the pattern of the die-off did not fit the pesticide theory. ''I would have expected that we would see the initial effects in the small bays and backwaters where the washout would first have occurred, not going out to the middle of the Sound almost immediately,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mattice's opinions did not go over well with the lobstermen. Many of them say a variety of factors may be in play -- several lobstermen and scientists believe a part of the problem is the recent rebound in striped bass, a major predator of lobsters. But bass or paramoebae cannot be required to pay damages.</p>
        <p>The night before the conference in Bridgeport, the lobstermen learned that a lawsuit filed on their behalf against the pesticide manufacturer Cheminova had been certified as a class action. The suit accuses Cheminova of causing economic harm to the lobstermen after its pesticide Fyfanon, a malathion product, was sprayed in Nassau and Suffolk in 1999.</p>
        <p>During the pretrial discovery phase of the case, the lobstermen's lawyer, Gladstone Jones, established that in 1999 Cheminova failed to label barrels of Fyfanon with a warning mandated by the Environmental Protection Agency. Exhibit A in Mr. Jones's filing, submitted to Judge E. Thomas Boyle of Federal District Court in Central Islip last August, is the warning that the E.P.A. ordered Cheminova to use. It begins: ''Application may not be made around bodies of water where fish or shellfish are grown and/or harvested commercially.''</p>
        <p>In a May 2002 letter to Christie Whitman, the E.P.A. director, Mr. Jones said that Cheminova stored Fyfanon in warehouses and storage tanks where the temperature reached at least 115 degrees, causing leaks and converting malathion to isomalathion, ''a significantly more toxic chemical.''</p>
        <p>Cheminova's lawyer, Christopher Kelly, did not respond to telephone calls seeking comment.</p>
        <p>''Class certification is one step on a long road,'' said Mr. Jones, a New Orleans environmental lawyer who is representing lobstermen on both sides of the Sound. ''We still have major hurdles, but we can bundle all the lobstermen together.'' He predicted that the case would go to trial this fall, at which time 300 to 500 lobstermen will be named as plaintiffs.</p>
        <p>At the symposium, the pesticide argument received a boost when Sylvan de Guise, a veterinary pathologist at the University of Connecticut, reported that his experiments proved that lobsters were sensitive to malathion. He said lobsters die when exposed to 33 parts per billion of malathion, a level that James O'Donald, a marine scientist at the University of Connecticut, calculated would have been present as far as 10 miles out into the western Sound after Hurricane Floyd.</p>
        <p>The storm on Sept. 17, 1999, after stepped-up aerial spraying of pesticide that summer, when the West Nile virus made its first appearance. ''It takes half as much malathion to kill a lobster than to kill a walleye,'' Dr. de Guise said. ''Walleyes are considered sensitive to malathion.''</p>
        <p>But he was not ready to declare a eureka moment. ''What does it mean?'' he asked. ''We're not quite sure. We would have to follow the lobsters in real life before exposure and follow them afterward. This is very difficult to do retrospectively. We cannot rule out effects we have not measured.''</p>
        <p>The lobstermen filed onto the 4:45 ferry for the ride home looking exhausted and agreeing that they had not learned anything new. ''None of this will bring the lobsters back,'' Mr. German said. ''Every year there are less lobstermen and less lobstermen -- and more scientists.''</p>
