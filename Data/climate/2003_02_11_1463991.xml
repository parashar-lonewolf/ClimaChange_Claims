        <p>When it comes to snowfall, even a flurry is likely to provoke a blizzard of reporting.</p>
        <p>''People love hearing about snow,'' said Nolan Doesken, a meteorologist at Colorado State University. But too often, he and other experts say, the nonstop coverage of winter weather masks a troubling decline in reliable snowfall statistics.</p>
        <p>''The loss of snowfall data globally is a major concern,'' said Dr. Barry Goodison, a climatologist in Toronto. As chairman of a scientific steering group in the World Climate Research Program, Dr. Goodison depends on snowfall figures to help predict climate change. But too often, he said, the information he needs does not exist.</p>
        <p>In Russia, social and economic shifts have undermined data collection across that vast and snowy country, Dr. Goodison said. In the United States, after the National Weather Service closed many of its weather stations in the 1990's, snowfall measurements were left in the hands of untrained workers.</p>
        <p>And training is critical, meteorologists say. ''Of the basic weather parameters, snowfall is the most difficult to measure,'' said Mr. Doesken, the author of a book and a videotape used to teach measuring techniques.</p>
        <p>The basic method -- sticking a ruler in the snow -- has not changed much in hundreds of years. But decisions have to be made about where and when to measure.</p>
        <p>''If one person's measuring on the roof of his car and another on a snowboard,'' Mr. Doesken said, referring to a surface that is cleared of snow at regular intervals, ''you've got a problem,'' Mr. Doesken said.</p>
        <p>Snow reaching the ground can melt, turn to vapor or compress snow that fell before it. If two people measure the same snowfall, one every hour and the other at the end of the storm, they ''would come up with different numbers,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Even the precise location matters. Dr. David J. Nolan, a meteorologist at the University of Miami, said: ''Drifting has to be accounted for. And think about walking around in the backyard with a ruler. You can get large variations just from the effects of a tree.''</p>
        <p>For much of the 20th century, the Weather Service operated hundreds of stations where meteorologists used established measurement techniques. In the 1990's, the service closed nearly half of its 300 stations, including offices in Stratford, Conn.; Newark; and Wilmington, Del.</p>
        <p>''When you look at the historical weather records,'' said Michael Schlacter, chief meteorologist at Weather 2000, a forecasting company in New York, ''you see this beautiful tally of snowfall going back 40 years or more. And then in 1997 or '98, the data just stop.''</p>
        <p>Some Weather Service offices were consolidated. The station at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, N.Y., on Long Island, now controls data collection for the entire New York metropolitan region, which once had six stations. The meteorologist in charge of the office, Michael E. Wyllie, conceded that the approach left ''gaps in snowfall measurement.''</p>
        <p>At the major airports, he said, Federal Aviation Administration employees have continued to take readings, ''although they're not required to.''</p>
        <p>In Central Park, zookeepers, not meteorologists, take the measurements, according to Mr. Wyllie, who said he had fought to keep the lone weather station in Manhattan open.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schlacter said the last 12 measurements Central Park that totaled at least three inches ended in ''point zero'' or ''point five.''</p>
        <p>''It makes you very suspicious that they're just rounding,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''We're working with them,'' Mr. Wyllie said about the zookeepers. ''We're doing the best we can.''</p>
        <p>At airports, meteorologists said, F.A.A. employees may not take measurements unless airport operations are affected. As a result, small snowfalls are reported as ''traces'' rather than actual amounts. Heavier snow may not be measured until it stops falling, meaning that there is no information about the progress of a storm.</p>
        <p>''And that isn't much use if you're trying to compare a snowfall of 1889 with a snowfall of 2003,'' Mr. Doesken. ''The numbers you hear on the news are typically from helpful spotters, who love to call in their reports. The media have learned to tap into these people. But they aren't the kind of measurements that can go into the official record.''</p>
        <p>Paul Knight, who is the state climatologist for Pennsylvania and a meteorologist at Penn State University, which has provided weather information to The New York Times for 17 years, agreed. ''The quality of snow reports has certainly diminished,'' he said. ''The Weather Service can't go sending out their personnel to Ronkonkoma and Passaic to see if the volunteers are measuring the snow correctly.''</p>
        <p>The loss of information has real-world effects on fields like insurance and litigation. Mark Kramer, a meteorologist who often appears as an expert witness, said he testified in a slip-and-fall case in which the amount of snow on the ground was an issue. Mr. Kramer said he could not find snowfall figures for Manhattan for several weeks before the accident. ''The judge,'' he said, ''was stunned.''</p>
        <p>The Weather Service moved heavily into automation in the 90's, replacing many staffed stations with electronic devices. ''For most weather variables, that's a story with a happy ending,'' Mr. Schlacter said. ''When it comes to temperature and humidity, readings were no longer impacted by human error. And you could get the information on the Web in real time.''</p>
        <p>But that is not true of snowfall. ''As easy as it seems,'' Mr. Doesken said, ''science is not producing a quick answer to the question of snowfall measurement.''</p>
        <p>In Canada, where vast amounts of snow collect in remote areas, hundreds of electronic measurement devices are used. Typically, a device sends an ultrasonic pulse from the top of a pole to the ground. The time it takes for the pulse to return, adjusted according to temperature, indicates snow depth.</p>
        <p>''I have one of them right here,'' Mr. Doesken said. ''It works once the snowfall has stopped and the snow on the ground has a firm, solid surface. If snow is still fluttering down or if the surface is fluffy, it's almost useless.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Goodison works for the Meteorological Service of Canada, where he helped develop the device. Although it is imperfect, he said, it fills a need in a country where snow often falls in remote areas. Over time, he said, scientists will develop formulas that will allow them to come up with accurate snowfall numbers from imperfect readings.</p>
        <p>For an automated approach to work, in Mr. Schlacter's view, it will have to simulate the actions of a human measurer. Such a device, he said, could take decades to develop. In the meantime, scientists hope to rely on more trained measurers, including volunteers.</p>
        <p>In places like Stratford, where the Weather Service closed its office in the 90's, ''volunteers have kept the snowfall records going,'' Mr. Wyllie said.</p>
        <p>''We've been lucky in the New York City area,'' he said, ''to have good people who have continued to take the measurements for us.''</p>
