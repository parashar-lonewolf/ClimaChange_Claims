        <p>Energy demand soared to record levels this summer -- and in the Hamptons, utility officials say, a lot of the air-conditioning it powered went straight out the door.</p>
        <p>A survey released yesterday by the Long Island Power Authority claimed that many retail stores in East Hampton and Southampton left their air-conditioners running with the doors open this summer, while not so many stores in Great Neck and Huntington did the same.</p>
        <p>A full 65 percent of the stores that LIPA surveyed in East Hampton left their doors open and their units on, while only 14 percent did so in Great Neck, the survey found. In Southampton, 30 of 53 stores, 56 percent, did business with the door open and air-conditioning on; in Huntington, it was only 12 of 150 stores, 8 percent.</p>
        <p>''Customers should ask the stores to close their doors,'' Richard M. Kessel, the authority's chairman, said in a statement. ''What good does it do to worry about such issues as air quality, global warming and high energy prices when one is scooting in and out of stores that waste 20 to 25 percent of the electricity they use?''</p>
        <p>The ''scooting'' comes in the context of rising power use, especially during the heat wave early this month. In the last eight years, Mr. Kessel said, the peak summer demand has increased on the South Fork of Long Island by 101 percent, from 117 megawatts in 1998 to a record of 236 megawatts, set Aug. 3.</p>
        <p>LIPA conducted its survey over the last few weeks, when temperatures were usually in the low 80's.</p>
        <p>In East Hampton village, Coach, Gucci, Elie Tahari and Second Nature Markets, a vitamin supplement shop, for example, all had air-conditioners going and doors flung open. ''Mainly, we do it because more people come in when the door is open,'' said Peter Reale, who was working at Second Nature.</p>
        <p>But Carol Stolz, who has a summer home in Bridgehampton, said an open door was an invitation to shop, nothing more: ''I look at the windows and walk in if I like what I see.''</p>
        <p>Her friend Barbara Eager, a summer resident of Watermill, echoed her assessment. ''Put it this way,'' Ms. Eager said, ''opening the door won't make me open my wallet.''</p>
        <p>This being the Hamptons, a second cousin of Art Buchwald's, Dick Buchwald, was walking up the street, and he was asked his opinion. ''If somebody here wants to go into Gucci,'' he said, ''they'll go in if the door is closed or open.''</p>
