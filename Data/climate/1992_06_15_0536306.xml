        <p>A Federal appeals judge has criticized journalists for what he described as biased reporting of the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>The judge, Laurence H. Silberman of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, said the press had "accepted and embraced the tenets of judicial activism."</p>
        <p>"The truth is that the lawyer-reporters are among the most unbalanced, the least abashed, at asserting the value of judicial activism," Judge Silberman said Saturday in a speech to the Federalist Society, a legal group that advocates a strict interpretation of the Constitution.</p>
        <p>The judge had the harshest words for The New York Times, saying, "It seems that the primary objective of The Times's legal reporters is to put activist heat on recently appointed Supreme Court justices."</p>
        <p>The judge said some had referred to this as the "Greenhouse effect," a reference to Linda Greenhouse, The Times's Supreme Court reporter. He called the reporting of Neil A. Lewis, who covers legal issues for The Times, "distorted and tendentious." Served Under Nixon</p>
        <p>Howell Raines, The Times's Washington editor, disputed Judge Silberman's contentions, saying coverage of the Federal courts had been detailed and unbiased. "Linda Greenhouse and Neil Lewis have given our readers balanced, fair, accurate and intellectually sound journalism," he said. "We stand by their work. For the record, neither is a lawyer, as Judge Silberman seems to suggest in his speech."</p>
        <p>The judge also criticized The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times and The Associated Press.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silberman, who was Deputy Attorney General in the Nixon and Ford Administrations and Ambassador to Yugoslavia in the Ford Administration, was appointed to the bench in 1985 by President Ronald Reagan. His wife, R. Gaull Silberman, is vice chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, on which she served with Justice Thomas.</p>
