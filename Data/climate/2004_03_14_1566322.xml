        <p>FOR all the hoopla about China's booming economy, its manufacturing muscle and its potential to become a great power, the world's most populous country is struggling to keep the lights on. And the sporadic blackouts that plagued much of China last year are raising complicated questions for the Communist Party and for the rest of the world:</p>
        <p>How and where will China get the energy it needs to maintain its economic growth? And how much will the environment suffer for it?</p>
        <p>''It's one of the hottest issues facing the international energy industry,'' said Scott Roberts, chief representative in the Beijing office of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm based in Massachusetts. ''The growth has been explosive, and I think it has caught many people in China and elsewhere off guard.''</p>
        <p>China's emergence has already roiled commodities markets, as the country has become a voracious consumer of energy and raw materials. Last year, its oil imports rose by nearly a third. It also built so many new cars, factories, airports and high-rises that it passed the United States to become the world's biggest steel importer, according to the Iron and Steel Statistics Bureau, a British-based information clearinghouse for the steel industry. Last year, China accounted for almost a third of the world's consumption of finished steel.</p>
        <p>Electricity consumption jumped by 15 percent. Domestic coal production rose by 100 million tons -- and still there were shortages.</p>
        <p>Yet China's appetite today is modest compared with what is estimated for the future; the country's energy needs are expected to more than double by 2020. This prospect has the Communist Party reportedly rolling out plans for at least 100 new power plants, including nuclear, hydropower and coal-fired ones. It has also raised concerns that efforts to improve China's polluted environment will be muted by the demand for power.</p>
        <p>China is trying just about every possible avenue to satisfy its power demands, and none offers a completely risk-free or ''clean'' solution. Plans call for at least 20 nuclear plants to be built by 2020. Hydropower projects, regarded by many Chinese officials as a clean power source, are threatening to disrupt the ecological balance on many important rivers that flow out of the high Tibetan plateau.</p>
        <p>China's primary energy source, and its dirtiest, is coal, which accounts for almost 70 percent of the power supply. Coal is a primary source of greenhouse gases, and experts predict that by 2020 China could pass the United States to become the world's biggest source of carbon monoxide. That this is happening is perhaps not surprising, because America is an economic, if not political, model for China.</p>
        <p>''The fundamental problem is that China is following the path of the United States, and probably the world cannot afford a second United States,'' said Zhang Jianyu, program manager for the Beijing office of Environmental Defense, an American-based advocacy group.</p>
        <p>In an address earlier this month before the annual meeting of the National People's Congress, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao captured the competing pressures of the economy when he cited environmental protection and called for building a ''conservation-minded society.'' Yet he also exhorted the country to develop more energy sources.</p>
        <p>''We must speed up the development of large coal mines, important power generating facilities and power grids, the exploration and exploitation of petroleum and other important resources,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Michelle Billig, a former energy attaché in the United States Embassy in Beijing, said China's leaders are improving energy efficiency and becoming more environmentally friendly. She noted that China is completing the creation of fuel-efficiency standards that are better than those in the United States. The government is also experimenting with buses and taxis that run on natural gas and expanding its use of ''clean'' coal technology.</p>
        <p>''In some ways, they are addressing these issues a lot more seriously than we are in the United States,'' said Ms. Billig, now an international affairs fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations.</p>
        <p>But experts agree that such efforts, as yet, are making only a tiny difference and that too often environmental restraints are brushed aside to meet the demand for power. Mr. Zhang said China's environmental degradation is already being measured in economic losses. He said state officials estimate that acid rain causes about $13 billion, while air pollution reduces the annual gross domestic product by about 3 percent.</p>
        <p>China is also often inefficient in its energy use. Mr. Roberts, the Cambridge Energy consultant, said that the worst Chinese industries waste 70 percent more energy than their counterparts in the United States. He also noted that China's electricity consumption grew by 15 percent last year and 10.4 percent in 2002 -- a spike in demand he said was equal to total power consumption in Brazil. ''They are adding a middle-sized country every two years in terms of energy consumption,'' he said.</p>
        <p>This helps explain why energy security is an increasingly important issue for Chinese leaders, particularly regarding oil. China began importing oil in the early 1990's, partly because its own supplies were leveling out, but also because of rising demand. Now the American invasion of Iraq has shown Chinese leaders, dependent on Middle East oil, how vulnerable they could become.</p>
        <p>A December 2003 analysis of China's energy situation by Deutsche Bank noted that in response to the Iraq war, China has begun building a group of storage facilities to create a strategic oil reserve. The report also noted that the country is aggressively pursuing oil deals around the world, from neighboring Kazakhstan and Russia to other oil fields in South America and even Canada. Earlier this year, President Hu Jintao made visits to African countries with significant oil fields.</p>
        <p>For now, power officials are warning citizens that another spate of blackouts is likely. Last year, nearly two-thirds of the provinces and autonomous regions experienced varying degrees of blackouts. This year, officials say, could be as bad, or maybe worse.</p>
        <p>Correction:  March 21, 2004, Sunday  An article last Sunday about China's energy needs misidentified the main greenhouse gas emitted by burning coal. It is carbon dioxide, not carbon monoxide.</p>
