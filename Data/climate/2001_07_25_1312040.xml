        <p>Former President Jimmy Carter has criticized President Bush in a newspaper interview, saying he is deeply disappointed with what he sees as the new administration's conservative bent, particularly in foreign affairs.</p>
        <p>''I have been disappointed in almost everything he has done,'' Mr. Carter said in an interview with The Columbus Ledger-Enquirer in Georgia.</p>
        <p>An article about the interview was published in the paper today. A call to Mr. Carter's office here was not returned.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carter, a Democrat who left office in 1981 after being defeated for re-election by Ronald Reagan, told the paper that he had attended Mr. Bush's inauguration because he had had high hopes for the Bush presidency.</p>
        <p>''I hoped coming out of an uncertain election he would reach out to people of diverse views, not just Democrats and Republicans but others who had different points of view,'' Mr. Carter said. ''I thought he would be a moderate leader, but he has been very strictly conforming to some of the more conservative members of his administration, his vice president and his secretary of defense in particular. More moderate people like Colin Powell have been frozen out of the basic decision-making in dealing with international affairs.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Carter said Mr. Bush should follow his father's precedent in demanding the removal of Israeli settlements on the West Bank.</p>
        <p>''George Sr. took a strong position on that issue, and so did I,'' Mr. Carter said.</p>
        <p>But he also encouraged Mr. Bush not to focus on the Middle East to the exclusion of the rest of foreign policy.</p>
        <p>''I noticed when President Clinton was in office, his secretary of state made 26 visits to the Middle East before going to any country in Africa,'' Mr. Carter said. ''I think the devastation of the wars in Africa is much more serious than conflicts in the Middle East.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Carter said the United States should respect the Kyoto Protocol, the 1997 international agreement intended to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, which Mr. Bush has criticized as too stringent.</p>
        <p>And he called Mr. Bush's plan for a space-based shield against missiles''technologically ridiculous'' and likely to increase tensions with the former Soviet republics.</p>
