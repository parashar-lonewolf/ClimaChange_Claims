        <p>Just after midnight, many of the taxi drivers in one company's fleet here turned off their meters and pulled to the side of the road, pausing for a minute to honor the dead of last Sept. 11.</p>
        <p>Parisians did something grander. Into the sky above the City of Light, before dawn and again after dusk, they shone two vertical beams -- twin towers -- to symbolize what had been lost and what was still remembered.</p>
        <p>So it went today throughout Europe and in places even farther from, and less closely connected to, the United States. Across the world, many people still mourned what happened on Sept. 11, and they still wanted Americans to know it.</p>
        <p>But in addition to the memorial concerts and prayer services, the special exhibits and rueful political remarks, there was something else -- something that had been pushed aside in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks but crept slowly back to center stage.</p>
        <p>There was skepticism about the way the United States conducts itself abroad. There were questions about the direction the United States is taking and the degree to which allies are being consulted.</p>
        <p>On this dark anniversary, the unfettered sympathy with which many foreigners reacted to last Sept. 11 gave way to a more complicated amalgam of emotions.</p>
        <p>Just as the Democrats and Republicans who sang ''God Bless America'' together at the Capitol are back to bickering, people around the world are back to resenting the United States for its wealth and willfulness and accusing it of its own sins.</p>
        <p>Foreigners still ached for the United States, but they also took issue with it. They still deplored the violence that was visited upon Americans, but they also wondered whether Americans bore some culpability.</p>
        <p>''It is monstrous, horrible -- I don't deny that,'' said Eveline Bureau, 50, of Paris. ''But the Americans didn't do anything to avoid what happened on Sept. 11. They have put themselves in danger, and now they put us in danger.''</p>
        <p>Last year, a day after Sept. 11, a front-page editorial in the French newspaper Le Monde stated and restated the phrase, ''We are all American.'' But on Tuesday, the same writer, Jean-Marie Colombani, in the same paper observed that ''the solidarity reflex from one year ago has been drowned in a wave that leads one to believe that, in the world, we have all become anti-American.''</p>
        <p>That may overstate what has happened, which is in some ways a change in focus as much as a change of heart.</p>
        <p>Twelve months of reflection on American policy in the Middle East and scrutiny into how the United States did or did not protect itself have yielded recriminations and resentments -- many of them familiar, some more barbed than in the past, all permitted expression by the passing of a year's time.</p>
        <p>They do not erase the respect and general affection that many foreigners feel toward the United States and showered on Americans today, as financial exchanges far and wide held moments of silence and as a ''rolling Requiem,'' Mozart's Mass, was performed in successive intervals across the time zones, from New Zealand to Portugal.</p>
        <p>But these feelings now compete once again with qualms about the United States that have been nourished anew by the Bush administration's increasingly tough talk of a military invasion of Iraq, which unsettles many foreigners.</p>
        <p>''Anti-Americanism is back,'' said Lyudmila M. Alexeyeva, a noted human rights advocate in Moscow. ''America is the strongest, richest and most successful country, and people here don't like that.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Alexeyeva also seemed to speak for many Russians when she added that ''Americans endured this suffering with honor.'' While a majority of Russians said in a recent poll that Americans deserved what happened to them, an even larger majority said they had a ''good'' or ''very good'' opinion of the United States.</p>
        <p>Initially, the foreigners who lined up for hours to sign condolence books, laid flowers at American embassies and bowed their heads in collective silence were reacting viscerally to a sorrowful tragedy in the only way that made emotional sense.</p>
        <p>The foreign leaders who said they stood without reservation beside the United States were making statements in a vacuum: it was not yet clear what standing beside the United States would mean.</p>
        <p>That was no longer the case once the United States started waging war in Afghanistan; threatening to wage war in Iraq; restricting some civil liberties; more aggressively screening immigrants, and saying all the while that it would do what it felt was necessary, even if allies disagreed.</p>
        <p>Those were concrete actions with measurable effects, and in India, news coverage of the anniversary of Sept. 11 has focused largely on people from that country who have been denied travel visas to the United States or treated as terrorist suspects there. One television channel promoted a report from New York on Tuesday about ''why South Asians still say they're victims, a year after Sept. 11.''</p>
        <p>In Germany, Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, who at first professed ''unconditional solidarity'' with the United States, is now fighting for re-election and taking exception to the Bush administration's Iraq policy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schröder's position seems to tap into the apprehensions of Germans like Walter Straudenrauss, 37, who said the dialogue in his country has changed since the first weeks after the terrorist attacks.</p>
        <p>''There is less sympathy and more rational political attitudes,'' Mr. Straudenrauss said. ''There are many questions now, like where do we stand on Iraq and what it means to have one superpower in the world.''</p>
        <p>Concern about what many Europeans perceive as American unilateralism is nothing new: it flared over the Bush administration's repudiation of a treaty on global warming and its reluctance to endorse an international crime tribunal.</p>
        <p>But that concern is no longer muted in the ways it was 12 or 11 or even 10 months ago. It is sometimes not muted at all. At the Venice Film Festival last week, one of the main events was the screening of a movie about Sept. 11 that included segments from 11 directors of different nationalities, several of whom were sharply critical of the United States.</p>
        <p>Last week in Ottawa, at a performance of Verdi's Requiem to commemorate Sept. 11, pictures of Hiroshima and Nagasaki after the United States dropped atomic bombs there were projected above the stage.</p>
        <p>Yet they were nonetheless paying homage in Ottawa, just as they did today in Berlin, where Mr. Schröder attended a candlelight religious service; in London, where 3,000 rose petals rained from the dome of St. Paul's Cathedral, and in Paris, where President Jacques Chirac attended a memorial event at the residence of the American ambassador, Howard Leach.</p>
        <p>''Today, France remembers,'' Mr. Chirac said. ''France knows what it owes America. Today, French people are side by side wholeheartedly with the American people.''</p>
        <p>Many Europeans observed a minute of silence, making clear that a basic human sadness transcended any of their disagreements with Americans and that amity persisted, even when unanimity did not.</p>
        <p>The evidence of that was everywhere. It was on a gondola that floated slowly down the Grand Canal in Venice with the sign: ''For the victims and heroes of Sept. 11.''</p>
        <p>It was also on a poster at Rome's central train station, where many Italians left drawings for the anniversary. The poster showed a plane slicing through a skyscraper, coupled with these words: ''I never loved you more, New York.''</p>
