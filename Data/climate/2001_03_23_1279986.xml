        <p>Offering their own solutions to the nation's energy problems, Senate Democrats introduced a bill today that would reduce the demand for fuel and increase the production of oil and natural gas.</p>
        <p>The proposal, which creates an array of tax incentives, pointedly leaves out a Republican plan to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska for oil exploration, an initiative fiercely opposed by most Democrats and some Republicans.</p>
        <p>''Despite the administration's daily warnings about an energy crisis,'' Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, said, ''the only solution the president has proposed is increasing the development of our public lands, including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. We cannot drill our way out of this problem.''</p>
        <p>Senator Jeff Bingaman, the New Mexico Democrat who wrote the bill, said he sought to balance environmental concerns with the need to increase production. In the past, many Democrats have not been inclined to push for oil drilling.</p>
        <p>Still, the bulk of the bill focuses on conserving energy while encouraging the use and development of renewable energy like solar power and wind power.</p>
        <p>No Republicans cosponsor the legislation offered by Senator Bingaman, the ranking Democrat on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. But he said today that some Republican colleagues, including those who oppose drilling in the refuge, had reacted favorably to provisions in the bill.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, Republicans in the House Budget Committee declined to include in a 2002 budget any revenue from oil drilling in the Alaskan refuge because the issue was too volatile, and the Republican chairman of Senate Budget Committee said he expected that Republicans in the Senate would do the same.</p>
        <p>Senate Republicans have introduced their own energy bill, which emphasizes increasing oil production to reduce reliance on foreign crude. The White House is expected to finish its own bill in April or May.</p>
        <p>''Today, at the same time that we're bringing in oil from Iraq, we're enforcing a no-fly zone,'' Senator Frank H. Murkowski, the Alaska Republican who is the chairman of the energy committee, has said.</p>
        <p>The Democrats' bill would require greater energy conservation in schools and government buildings, and streamline approval for gas pipelines and power transmission lines. To increase the flow of natural gas, the bill also offers a tax incentive to build a pipeline from Alaska's North Slope.</p>
        <p>In response to California's electricity crisis, the bill seeks to limit the amount of money that producers can charge for wholesale power in 11 Western states, an idea that President Bush has rejected.</p>
        <p>The legislation, in an approach sure to rankle Republicans, calls for limits by 2008 on the amount of fuel that light trucks and sport utility vehicles, which consume more gas than cars, can use. Democrats say this provision would save 1.2 million barrels of crude oil a day. But the bill gives the Bush administration greater leeway in meeting these fuel efficiency standards.</p>
        <p>With the Republicans intensifying the campaign for more domestic oil and natural gas, the Democrats say they, too, want to increase production but draw the line at drilling in environmentally sensitive areas, calling it unnecessary.</p>
        <p>Instead, the bill offers tax credits for operators of small wells if the price of oil dips below $14 a barrel or the price of natural gas is less than $1.56 per thousand cubic feet. Big oil companies would receive tax credits if the oil price fell below $11 a barrel.</p>
        <p>And the bill would allow the Bush administration to go ahead with the lease of more of the Gulf of Mexico for oil drilling.</p>
        <p>''The Republican approach seems to be supply only,'' Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said, ''and, for a long time, Democrats said reduce demand only. But this is a balanced approach.''</p>
