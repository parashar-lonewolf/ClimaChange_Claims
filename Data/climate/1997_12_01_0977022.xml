        <p>FOR four years after playing host to the 1992 Earth Summit here, Brazil claimed that the destruction of the Amazon rain forest -- home to the world's richest trove of bacterial, plant, animal and insect species -- was on the decline.</p>
        <p>But when it finally released data last year on the period through 1994, the figures showed precisely the opposite, a 34 percent increase in deforestation, to about 15,000 square kilometers a year from 11,000 square kilometers, destroyed through colonization by ranchers and farmers and illegal logging.</p>

        <p>FOR four years after playing host to the 1992 Earth Summit here, Brazil claimed that the destruction of the Amazon rain forest -- home to the world's richest trove of bacterial, plant, animal and insect species -- was on the decline.</p>
        <p>But when it finally released data last year on the period through 1994, the figures showed precisely the opposite, a 34 percent increase in deforestation, to about 15,000 square kilometers a year from 11,000 square kilometers, destroyed through colonization by ranchers and farmers and illegal logging.</p>
        <p>Once again this year, official word on the extent of rain forest destruction, this time for data since 1994, is running late, with the Government pledging to release them the day before the Kyoto conference begins. But the thick clouds of black smoke that have shut schools and airports near the forests' edges have left little doubt among Brazilians about the trend.</p>
        <p>Weather satellites show the number of fires increased 11 percent in the June to October burning season. While most fires are not located in primary rain forest, some environmentalists believe that the increased burning corresponds to an increase in deforestation and makes the rain forests more vulnerable to accidental fires.</p>
        <p>Brazilian officials say they are making progress. They are moving to crack down on deforestation by revoking 63 percent of logging licenses, many of which were being used to log in excess of legal limits, and are overhauling government policies that traditionally rewarded ranching or planting in the rain forest as an improvement on the land.</p>
        <p>But environmentalists fear that the Amazon may face new threats ahead. A state-of-the-art radar surveillance project to reveal the Amazon's hidden resources is under way, as well as major road projects to make the Amazon more accessible for industry.</p>
        <p>Before the Kyoto meeting, Brazilian officials said their country's fires and rain forest destruction paled next to the environmental damage caused by United States industry, which puts out 22 percent of the world's fossil fuel emissions. Brazil says it puts out less than 3 percent of the fossil fuel emissions.</p>
        <p>Brazilian officials also criticize the G-7, the seven richest industrial nations, for declining to spend $1.5 billion for environmental protection programs that Brazil requested in 1990. But environmentalists argue that the problem is not one of money, but of political will. Of the $260 million that was pledged, Brazil has spent only some 30 percent.</p>
