        <p>Leonor Araceli Paloma Tomero, the daughter of Judith B. Tomero and Rafael Tomero Alarcón of Bethesda, Md., and Madrid, was married yesterday to Douglas Bryan Shaw, the son of Ruth Jean Shaw and Dr. Robert D. Shaw of Anchorage. The Rev. John P. Langan, a Roman Catholic priest, performed the ceremony at the Dahlgren Chapel at Georgetown University.</p>
        <p>Ms. Tomero, 28, is keeping her name. She is a consultant on environmental protection and renewable energy with Liebman &amp; Associates, a Washington consulting firm. She is also the president of the Lawyers Alliance for World Security, an organization in Washington that works to control weapons and prevent nuclear terrorism. A graduate of Cornell University, the bride received a master's degree in security studies from Georgetown and a law degree, cum laude, from American University.</p>
        <p>Her parents, who are retired from the United Nations, worked in Geneva, where the bride's father was the chief of the Spanish translation section of the governing body of the International Labor Organization and her mother was a cataloger in the library of the World Health Organization.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shaw, 34, is the manager of policy and issues analysis in the office of the president of Georgetown, where he is also a doctoral candidate and an instructor in international relations. He is also a vice president of the Institute on Religion and Public Policy, an organization in Washington that helps religious communities become involved in public policy discussions.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom worked in the Clinton administration from 1993 to 1997, first as a special assistant in the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and then at the Energy Department, where he was a special adviser on the nuclear materials security task force. He graduated and received a master's degree in security studies from Georgetown. His mother is the manager of library resources for the Anchorage public schools, and is the president of the Alaska chapter of the Association for the Advancement of University Women. His father retired as Alaska's state archaeologist, and now works as a consultant for cultural resource preservation in Anchorage.</p>
