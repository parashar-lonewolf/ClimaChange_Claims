        <p>The people of the Alps have always reshaped their breathtaking and dangerous landscapes. But in recent years they have become more than ever the masters of the mountains, taming rivers behind dams, razing forests for roads and ski runs and covering slopes with tourist resorts.</p>
        <p>Yet in the scramble to accommodate 100 million visitors a year in a region that ranges from southern France to Slovenia, a debate is raging over how much further man can go in extracting pleasure and profit before nature strikes back.</p>
        <p>Some say nature is already doing so.</p>
        <p>Narrow valleys are choking on the pollution from factories and passenger and freight traffic -- traffic that will increase as trade barriers in Europe come down. As traffic increases, so does acid rain, which has already blighted more than half the trees, which then topply easily in storms.</p>
        <p>The wolf, the bear, the ibex and the falcon have largely disappeared, along with many other bird and plant species. The Evil That Men Do</p>
        <p>"The question is not whether but when we are reaching a turning point," said Thomas Berghold, a professor of physics and environmental counselor to the city of Zurich. "If we let this kind of economic growth run its course, it will destroy the Alps as a habitat."</p>
        <p>Not that life was ever without danger among these stunning peaks, which range across France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria and Slovenia.</p>
        <p>Yet since the skiing boom of the seventies, things have changed: Alpine villages, once protected by thick forests, have become more exposed. Mountain roads have changed watercourses and destabilized the slopes. The sick and diminished forests and the erosion have in turn brought more mudslides, floods and avalanches.</p>
        <p>Experts warn that such disasters are likely to increase. "You cannot meddle with water flows on such a scale, and then expect to get away with it," said Pierre Gensac, a watershed specialist.  No to Revolving Restaurants</p>
        <p>In every Alpine nation, environmental associations are pressing for a slowdown in the conquest of the mountains. They argue that the 40,000 ski runs, with their 12,000 lifts and cable cars, are enough, that there is no need for more revolving restaurants on mountaintops. Dozens of groups are demanding a ban on new resorts, on helicopters dropping skiers on untouched glaciers, on bulldozers.</p>
        <p>The rest of Europe is watching and its interests are contradictory. Many nations have a stake in the Alpine slopes because the snow and ice feed Europe's four major rivers, the Rhine, the Rhone, the Po and the Danube, which spill into three different seas.</p>
        <p>"The Alps are Europe's watertowers," said Tage Nielsen, a specialist in water management. The speed with which water runs steadily from forests or gushes from eroded slopes, he said, can have great impact on the water needed for drinking, irrigation or navigation hundreds of miles away.</p>
        <p>But the Alps are also Europe's crossroads, and the European Community is demanding new highways and tunnels to cope with traffic. A cargo boom will put new pressure on the Alps, which already have the world's busiest mountain roads, carrying more than 15 percent of Europe's freight traffic through a narrow sliver of territory.  No to More Tunnels</p>
        <p>Just below the glowing Mont Blanc, the roar of traffic echoes around the narrow valley as trucks and cars heading for a tunnel linking France and Italy. Last year, 800,000 trucks and four million passenger cars passed through. Managers expect the tunnel to be saturated soon and want to double its size. But the people of Chamonix, a nearby French resort, are fighting this.</p>
        <p>"We want less traffic, not more," said Claude Marin, an official at the Chamonix town hall. "We already get the fallout from 25 tons of fuel a day."</p>
        <p>For the moment, he said, the tunnel project has been postponed.</p>
        <p>Chamonix is just a part of the anti-traffic lobby.</p>
        <p>In March, the Green Party in Switzerland collected 50,000 signatures, enough to force a referendum this September on a separate plan -- a $25 billion project to drill two railroad tunnels through the Alps. This would be Europe's public works project, costing almost twice as much as the tunnel under the English Channel.</p>
        <p>The two tunnels are the cornerstone of a new transit agreement between the European Community and Switzerland, which has committed itself to doubling its railroad capacity by 1995.</p>
        <p>Until a hundred years ago, the mountains and their wild waters were seen as enemies. Then governments built dams to control mud and water and laid ducts and culverts to capture water for reservoirs and generators. Cheap electricity attracted industries, bringing wealth but also waste.</p>
        <p>"Hydro-power has made for the most drastic intervention," said Jaro Stvan, author of "The Tamed Alps," a study of man's impact. Tiny Switzerland has more than 1,100 dams, reservoirs, basins and small and large hydroelectric installations, producing 60 percent of the nation's electricity. "It has completely changed the lakes, the landscape and the water regime," said Mr. Stvan. "Below the dams, rivers and gullies are often stone dry."</p>
        <p>Mr. Stvan, an architect, rails against the "ugly ski-lift terminals, parking places, boxlike hotels and apartments that have no respect for the landscape or the local style and building materials." But he worries most about new resorts, railroads and other big projects that will require more energy and more dams.</p>
        <p>Plans to add a second dam to the high Grimsel Lake in Switzerland have brought wide opposition because it would inundate one-third of an ancient glacier. Critics warn that the glacier could break or melt, slip into the lake and create a wave that would flood the valley below. 'All Those Machines'</p>
        <p>George Roth, a farmer who looks out over three stunning Swiss valleys on the heights above Leysin, says he does not mind skiers. Even in winter, Mr. Roth and his wife, Josianne, get up early and milk the cows. Then they take the cable car up to 6,000 feet, where they have converted a summer stable into a skiers' cafe.</p>
        <p>They like the extra income and mingling with the visitors. But they hate "all those machines.</p>
        <p>"Everyone wants bigger and better ski runs," said Mr. Roth, so machines flatten the runs and harden the snow, which turns to ice. The ice melts later than snow, "so we get less grass." Mrs. Roth added, "There must be a way to ski and not destroy so much."</p>
        <p>As they spoke, two helicopters broke the luminous stillness.  The Demise of Farming</p>
        <p>Experts say that good ski-runs need not be an ecological hazard if properly shaped and lined with vegetation. But such rules are often overlooked.</p>
        <p>"Ski-runs generally create more run-off," said Mr. Nielsen, the watershed specialist. "Water comes down faster and in bigger quantities. You need bigger culverts and check dams. With excess run-off, ravines quickly become deeper and slopes become more unsteady and slide or collapse."</p>
        <p>The Roth family owns one of the last four farms around Leysin. Twenty years ago, there were 25. The story of the vanishing farmers is repeated throughout the Alps, although many governments subsidize farmers to keep them on the land, to take care of trees and guard the landscape.</p>
        <p>"If you take away the farmers, the landscape degrades even faster," said Mr. Berghold, the adviser in Zurich. "Many chalet owners are outsiders and they don't know or care."</p>
        <p>Furthermore, Government officials and environmentalists worry about the dwindling number of cows, seeing cattle as useful, rather than the environmental burden they are viewed as elsewhere: The cows crop grass, and short grass holds snow, while long grass bends and lets the snow slip off, leading to snowslides in these steep slopes.  Organizing for Action</p>
        <p>The seven Alpine nations signed an Alps Treaty in October to regulate growth and make the economy and the environment more compatible. But it may take several years before regulations are written and accepted as law.</p>
        <p>In all Alpine countries, citizens' groups have banded together to protect the mountains. Some belong to national Green Parties, while others work locally, lobbying against garbage dumps or ski lifts. The International Commission for the Protection of the Alps, an umbrella for more than 30 groups, informs governments, local officals and private groups of damage that new projects can cause. Of late, large corporations have found environmental action good for their image and have started to support conservation groups.</p>
        <p>What amazes Alpinists is how much people are willing to soil the beauty they have come to admire. The head of Alp Action, Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, warns that tourism may yet kill tourism unless the precarious beauty of the Alps is protected.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Sayer, who works at the International Union for Conservation of Nature in Geneva, said he recently returned to Nadelhorn peak after 15 years. Even here, on one of the Alps highest peaks, he said, the changes were striking:</p>
        <p>"Paths and gullies were worn and mountain bikes and sports vehicles had skidded and rutted the soil. Looking down, I saw ski lifts and bulldozed runs everywhere. People enjoy skiing; it's important for people to earn money. I find it hard to oppose. But I wouldn't want to see it go much further."</p>
