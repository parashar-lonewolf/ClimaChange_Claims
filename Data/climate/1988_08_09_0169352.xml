        <p>LEAD: The third-hottest summer in the New York region since 1869, when Ulysses S. Grant was President, is taking its toll on the psychological makeup of an already feverish city, straining civility in offices, automobiles and parks.</p>
        <p>The third-hottest summer in the New York region since 1869, when Ulysses S. Grant was President, is taking its toll on the psychological makeup of an already feverish city, straining civility in offices, automobiles and parks.</p>
        <p>While police and health officials in New York City say the effect of the heat cannot be isolated, given normally crowded emergency rooms and psychiatric wards, experts suggest that psychiatric problems and stress are linked to the combination of smog, high humidity and high barometric pressure.</p>
        <p>Power failures have not helped, either. Thirty sites in Manhattan remained without power much of yesterday, but by last night all power had been restored.  [ Page B1. ]  'A Sense of Doom'</p>
        <p>With the pavements the consistency of knishes and the subway platforms like saunas, the extreme heat of the last few weeks has given Gayanne La Roe, a secretary at St. James Episcopal Church, ''an impending sense of doom.''</p>
        <p>''We've heard about the greenhouse effect and the ozone layer and the oceans,'' she said, sitting in an unlighted church office with one whirring fan, a gloomy-enough setting in less hellish times. ''So I was depressed about our planet for the last few weeks, as if I didn't have enough problems.'' Swollen Feet, Frequent Showers</p>
        <p>That's the problem, it seems. Everyone has enough problems. ''Everybody is very crotchety, and concentration seems to be reduced,'' said Esther Teller. ''People seem less civilized; they think they can say almost anything.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Teller does consumer research for a cosmetics company. ''Everything seems to expand in the heat,'' she said. ''Your pores. Your feet are swollen. Your hair is swollen. You don't want to get too close to anyone, even people you like. You just want to be in the shower all the time.''</p>
        <p>The police have a theory about crime and the heat that is analogous to Alexis de Tocqueville's theory about the French Revolution: the oppressed don't revolt until the oppression is lifted and their expectations are aroused. ''Some police specialists say the heat is not the real problem, that when it's 99 degrees, people are like whipped dogs trying to get air,'' said Capt. Thomas Fahey, of the Police Department. ''It's the first cool night that you worry about. That's when their aggression comes out.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Albert Mehrabian, professor of psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles, lends support to the police. The psychological effect of prolonged heat is lethargy and listlessness, he said, a result usually compounded by humidity.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mehrabian said physical activity and mental alertness is the main variable, summarized as ''arousal.'' A sharp increase or decrease in heat, however, is ''very arousing.'' Most crime, he said, takes place ''in the unpleasant and uglier parts of our cities,'' where there's more poverty and frustration. ''So if you combine sudden changes in temperature with an ugly environment, you get high arousal plus displeasure, and that can result in anger, frustration, anxiety, and aggression.''</p>
        <p>Vito A. Turso speaks for the New York City Sanitation Department. ''I think the air is so stagnant, it can't help but feel heavier and smell a little more robust,'' Mr. Turso said. ''People also sit around outside more, to try to catch some sort of breeze, and they eat outside al fresco, and that creates more litter and overflowing litter baskets once in a while.'' More rats? ''That's not really my department,'' said Mr. Turso. ''But if there's a smorgasbord of fast food around a litter basket, especially overnight, that might create a vermin problem.'' 'Not a Happy Time'</p>
        <p>The sanitation workers are doing their level best, Mr. Turso said. ''People are just trying to stay cool and not win any personality awards. It's not easy being behind a truck that gobbles up 12 tons of garbage a shift, and you have to load half of it. When there's high heat and humidity, it's not a happy time for sanitation workers.''</p>
        <p>Nor for bagel makers. Susan L. Weiner, an owner of Smithaven Bagels Inc. in Lake Grove, L.I., said tempers were flaring around the ovens. ''The teen-agers who work for us are complaining about headaches,'' she said. ''They can hear the beach calling, but, of course, on days off they can't count on getting to the beach because of all the closings. Between that and the heat, everybody is walking a very thin line.''</p>
        <p>Meteorologists seem happy enough, however. Anthony Gigi of the National Weather Service said, ''I guess most people wish it would be cooler, but I haven't seen anybody take a hatchet to me yet.'' It's been hot, Mr. Gigi admitted, but, sadly, there haven't been any big records broken. ''If you're going to be miserable,'' he said philosophically, ''you might as well break a record. Because then you'll remember: that was that horrible summer.'' Not the Hottest</p>
        <p>''But just looking at the numbers,'' as Mr. Gigi said, ''in terms of being the hottest summer on record, it won't be by any standard you pick.'' We're not even in a heat wave, he said, because by definition that requires three consecutive days of 90 degrees or above, and yesterday's high in New York City was 88, appropriate for 8/8/88. Sensing some professional disappointment on the other end of the phone, Mr. Gigi hastened to add: ''But it is hotter than normal.''</p>
        <p>In fact, it is already the hottest summer since 1983, which was, after all, five years ago. And 1983 was the second-hottest summer since record-keeping began in 1869, surpassed only by 1966. In the last 10 days, Mr. Gigi said, the high has never been lower than 87 degrees, and five days were above 90, ''but not any three in a row.''</p>
        <p>So far this summer, there have been 25 days of 90 degrees or above, Mr. Gigi said, with another expected today (92 degrees), already surpassing last year's total of 22. 1986 had 18, the area average; 1985 had 9, and 1984 had 10. The summer of 1983, the second hottest, had 36. Maybe next year. Silver Lining for Dry Cleaners</p>
        <p>The weather has also been good for dry cleaners and narcotics agents. ''People are changing clothes more, usually twice a day, so they bring in more,'' said Lorenzo Hwang of Andre and Annette Dry Cleaning on the Upper East Side.</p>
        <p>Robert Strang, a special agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration in New York, said ''narcotics dealers are outside more, and more visible to us, so it's easier to get around and do surveillance. It can help enhance cases: you can see deals that are more blatant, at least on the street level.''</p>
        <p>Captain Fahey, the commanding officer of the Police Department's information division, asked: ''Are the reporters I deal with any more deranged? Not really.'' But people were short-tempered, he said. ''When you're driving around, it's hard as hell. People are irritable and cut each other off.''</p>
        <p>In the heat, the captain said, officers may wear short-sleeved shirts, but must still carry mandatory equipment, which includes a gun belt, extra ammunition, whistle and handcuffs. At night, officers must carry a flashlight and a nightstick. ''It can add up to a lot of weight,'' Captain Fahey said. ''But they adapt: when it's going to be really miserable they may take a lighter flashlight.''</p>
        <p>A bulletproof vest is optional. ''But the police believe in the full moon theory,'' the captain said. ''So with the heat, they go out fully equipped. Not many cops will go out today without the vest, even with the heat.'' Medical Correlations</p>
        <p>Dr. John Briere, assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Southern California Medical School, published a paper on heat and emergency hospital admissions in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology in February 1983. He found that heat, per se, was not a very good indicator. But admissions were correlated with high barometric pressure, high humidity and smog.</p>
        <p>Asked if abnormal behavior in New York City might mean that people are behaving normally, at least as defined by outlanders, Dr. Briere said: ''Studying the abnormal rates of normal behavior in New York City - that might be a good idea.''</p>
        <p>Suzi Halpin, a spokeswoman for the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation, said that it was difficult to break out the effects of the heat. ''Our in-patient psychiatric units are usually at close to 100 percent occupancy or better, and that has been the case for several months, so I don't think we can point just at the heat.'' The same was true, she said, for emergency rooms. But she and others said there is an increased risk of heat stroke, which can be fatal, especially for the elderly or those with diabetes and respiratory or heart disorders.</p>
        <p>The mental hygiene department, Ms. Halpin said, also warned that heat mixed badly with alcohol, which is dehydrating, and with tranquilizers, which seem to be the city's anodynes of choice.</p>
        <p>William H. Whyte, author of ''The Organization Man'' and ''The Sociology of Small Urban Spaces,'' has been studying the behavior of people in their cities for over 20 years. Fresh from his own plunge into the streets yesterday, he said: ''What strikes me is what a hardy race we are in New York City. This really is a street town. In some cities of the South, people wouldn't dream of going out on days like this.''  WHEN WARMTH BECOMES DANGEROUS  HEAT STROKE  CAUSE: Inadequate or failure of heat loss  WARNINGS: Hot, red, dry skin; little sweating; hard rapid pulse; very high temperature  APPEARANCE: Hot, dry skin; little sweating; hard rapid pulse; very high temperature  WHAT TO DO: Go immediately to hospital for emergency cooling by wrapping or immersion in cold water or ice  HEAT EXHAUSTION  CAUSE: Excessive fluid loss  WARNINGS: Gradual weakness, nausea, anxiety, excess sweating, faintness  APPEARANCE: Clammy skin; weak, slow pulse; low blood pressure; faintness  WHAT TO DO: If you feel faint, put your head down; replace lost salt and water orally (IV rarely used)  Source: The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy, 1987</p>
