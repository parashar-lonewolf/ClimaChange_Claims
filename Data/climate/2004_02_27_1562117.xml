        <p>Pension fund managers representing public employees in Connecticut, New York, Maine and New York City said yesterday that they had filed shareholder resolutions calling on 10 North American oil companies to report to investors on their plans to deal with the potential impact of global warming and related climate change on their businesses.</p>
        <p>The resolutions added the heft of some of the nation's largest investors to the ranks of shareholder activists who have been using resolutions to confront the petroleum industry on climate change issues. The resolutions also took aim at a broader range of companies, including midsize oil companies like Anadarko Petroleum, Devon Energy and Valero Energy that previously had flown below the radar of the activists.</p>
        <p>''This is the first climate change-related resolution we have filed,'' said Alan G. Hevesi, the New York State comptroller, who as the sole fiduciary of the New York Common Retirement Fund, manages the second-largest public pension fund in the nation after the California fund. ''I believe it's going to become a major issue for institutional investors.''</p>
        <p>Andrew Logan, the oil industry analyst at the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies, said the inclusion of smaller companies, which focus on exploration and production of oil and gas, reflected the sense that they could be more vulnerable than the more diversified giants like Exxon Mobil and ChevronTexaco to regulatory changes and taxes on greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
        <p>The coalition is an umbrella group of environmental organizations and businesses that has been coordinating the shareholder efforts along with the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, a coalition of 275 religious institutional investors.</p>
        <p>Many oil companies have asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to rule that there is no need to present the resolutions to shareholders at their annual meetings. ''We feel we have already been responsive to these queries in a number of forums, most recently in our energy trends report posted on our Web site early this month,'' a spokeswoman for Exxon Mobil, Lauren Kerr, said.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for Anadarko, Teresa Wong, said the company expected to put the resolution to a shareholder vote but would urge investors to oppose the requested study as a waste of money. She said that the company, which is based in The Woodlands, a Houston suburb, had taken steps to address the climate change issue. One project in Wyoming, for example, uses a process that injects carbon dioxide into the ground to increase production at a century-old oil field while keeping the gas out of the atmosphere where it could contribute to global warming.</p>
        <p>Over all, shareholders have filed 51 resolutions so far this year calling on various companies to respond to energy and environmental issues, according to the Investor Responsibility Research Center, a company in Washington that tracks such activity. The resolutions address diverse concerns like waste from nuclear power plants, toxic emissions from chemical companies and recycling, but about half deal with climate change, which has emerged in the last three years as the most widespread concern, said Meg Voorhes, director of the research center's social responsibility service.</p>
