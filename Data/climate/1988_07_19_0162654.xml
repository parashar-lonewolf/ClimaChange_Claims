        <p>LEAD: Long before syringes and sewage began washing up on the shores of the metropolitan region this summer, area Congressmen knew that the marine environments were in decline.</p>
        <p>Long before syringes and sewage began washing up on the shores of the metropolitan region this summer, area Congressmen knew that the marine environments were in decline.</p>
        <p>For years, New York Harbor, the ocean waters from Montauk Point to Cape May, the Long Island Sound and hundreds of rivers and lakes in the region have been exhibiting symptoms of deterioration, from declining fish catches to unexplained dolphin deaths to mysterious algae blooms.</p>
        <p>But while the region's legislators in Washington agree that the pollution must be stopped and a serious cleanup begun, there is no clear consensus on what has gone wrong in the past or on how to correct the situation now.</p>
        <p>Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, for example, said that until the recent beach closings, water problems were not sufficiently high on the policy agenda of the public or its representatives. ''The beach closings we've had this summer could be a blessing in disguise if they bring out citizen outrage and concern,'' said the New York Republican. ''It's a message that we have to have the most rigorous laws and penalties.'' 'Excuses Are not Acceptable'</p>
        <p>By contrast, Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, a New Jersey Democrat, said that there has been ''a hell of a lot of legislation over the past few years'' but that the Environmental Protection Agency has not enforced those laws vigorously enough. Senator Bill Bradley agreed. ''The E.P.A. has not been responsive,'' the New Jersey Democrat said. ''On the Federal level we've got to start saying to the bureaucrats that excuses are not acceptable any more.''</p>
        <p>E.P.A spokesmen reject these charges as unfair.</p>
        <p>Senator Lowell P. Weicker, Republican of Connecticut, said he thought the problem was that ''we have not been willing to spend enough money on everything that has to do with water, be it marine research, funds for sewage plants or acid rain.''</p>
        <p>And Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, saw a link between dirty water and ''the gentrification of politics.''</p>
        <p>''The governing classes nowadays want to talk about social justice and projects that provide jobs for lawyers,'' he said. ''No one wants to talk about sewers.''</p>
        <p>Other members of Congress argue that a good start has been made, and that they deserve more credit than they are generally accorded. For example, last year a law was passed committing the United States to an international treaty banning the ocean dumping of plastics. And last week, local lawmakers agreed on a bill to control the smokestack emissions that cause acid rain. Detailed studies are now under way of both the Long Island Sound and the New York bight, the crescent of water washing New York, New Jersey and Long Island. No Simple Solutions</p>
        <p>''You can't say that the delegation isn't doing anything on water issues,'' said Lynn Edgerton, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Fund. ''But I think you don't give A's for effort, but only for results. And it should be obvious that we're not winning this war.''</p>
        <p>Environmental advocates also acknowledge that the problem of the deteriorating marine environment is not susceptible to quick or simple solutions.</p>
        <p>''You're not dealing with just one source of pollution,'' said Clifton E. Curtis, president of the Oceanic Society, a nonprofit research and education organization. ''You have to address land-based pipeline discharges, industrial and residential sewage, toxic runoff, ocean dumping, garbage and marine debris generated both by ships and from land and atmospheric sources like acid rain.''</p>
        <p>While in principle there is broad agreement that all such forms of contamination must be curbed, in practice, ''everybody wants to be an exception and the government goes along,'' said John Cronin, the Keeper of the Hudson River, an on-the-water watchguard sponsored through the Hudson River Fishermen's Association.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, too, solutions fail because they do not go far enough. For example, a state law passed last year requires strict accounting of wastes by hospitals that produce more than 220 pounds a month. ''But 220 pounds is a lot of vials and needles,'' said Mr. D'Amato. Although he said that he did not know the source of the hospital waste washing up in New York, he added that, ''I think it's pretty clear now that we have to expand the accounting to smaller medical facilities as well.'' Algae Are Thriving</p>
        <p>A similar, if considerably more intractable shortcoming, involves the sewage treatment plants along Long Island Sound. Unlike many New York City treatment plants, those plants do prevent raw sewage and contaminants from entering the water. But they allow the intrusion of ''excess nutrient flows, mainly of nitrogen and phosphorous,'' said Michael Oppenheimer, a senior scientist for the Environmental Defense Fund. Algae feed on the nutrients and flourish, he said, and that has been adversely altering the Sound's ecology.</p>
        <p>Treatment plants that remove nitrogen and phosphorous from sewage could have been built years ago and could still be added, said Mr. Weicker. But the cost of those additions now, he added, might run as high as $10 billion.</p>
        <p>An indication of how difficult it is to pry that kind of money out of Washington was apparent last week when Mr. Moynihan attempted to amend the Clean Water Act's construction grants program to add funds for waste-water treatment programs. The amendment would have meant an additional $1.1 billion for New York over an eight-year period, enabling 804 pending projects to get under way, he said.</p>
        <p>Under the Senate's current budget limitation rules, however, some of that money would have come out of the space program. With filtering water pitted against exploring outer space, the New York Democrat's amendment was defeated by a 2-1 margin.</p>
        <p>The metropolitan region's representatives also fight among themselves, particularly over the dumping of treated sewage sludge at a site about 100 miles from shore. A bill sponsored by New Jersey representatives would ban all sludge dumping by 1992 and levy fines against municipalities - including several in northern New Jersey - that continue to dump after 1988.</p>
        <p>New York lawmakers oppose the measure, arguing that New York City in particular needs more time to develop ecologically safe and affordable land-based disposal alternatives for the millions of gallons of sludge generated every year. The bill is now consid ered increasingly likely to pass the House but New York City officials are counting on Senators Moynihan and D'Amato to block a companion proposal that has been introduced in the Senate by Mr. Lautenberg.</p>
        <p>That may not happen. The recent beach closings, though not related to sludge dumping, appear to have persuaded Mr. Moynihan that dumping is becoming unacceptable and anti-dumping legislation unstoppable. New York City has to find an alternative solution sooner rather than later, he said.</p>
