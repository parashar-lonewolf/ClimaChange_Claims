        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki ordered today that state buildings get 20 percent of their electricity from renewable energy sources like solar or wind power by 2010, an effort that environmentalists lauded as the most ambitious of its kind in the country.</p>
        <p>The governor also appointed a task force of industry leaders, state officials and environmentalists to find ways to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in New York, to combat global warming, and renewed his call for federal emissions standards for older power plants.</p>
        <p>The announcements set Mr. Pataki apart from his fellow Republican, President Bush, and the governor's aides acknowledged that as he approached a re-election campaign next year, it behooved him to distance himself from the president and his increasingly unpopular environmental policies.</p>
        <p>The governor signed an executive order mandating that state facilities draw at least 10 percent of their electric power from renewable sources by 2005, and 20 percent by 2010. The order applies to the state's buildings and those of quasi-independent agencies like the State University of New York and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.</p>
        <p>''It's probably the most aggressive renewables program of any state,'' said John P. Cahill, a senior adviser to the governor. ''We believe it's very doable.''</p>
        <p>The policy could help reduce the strain that rising demand has put on traditional sources of electricity, and give an important boost to fledgling industries including the makers of fuel cells, which generate electricity from fossil fuels, like natural gas, without combustion or air pollution. Environmentalists said a handful of other states had adopted similar policies but had not gone as far as the 20 percent requirement.</p>
        <p>''Whoa, that's fantastic,'' Val Washington, executive director of Environmental Advocates, said of the governor's order.</p>
        <p>Peter Iwanowicz, director of environmental health for the American Lung Association of New York State, said, ''This puts the state on a fairly impressive, aggressive pathway toward using sources of electricity that don't pollute.''</p>
        <p>The order also requires the state to adhere to strict energy efficiency standards when it constructs buildings or significantly renovates existing ones.</p>
        <p>In assessing the nation's energy needs, President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have largely dismissed the role renewables and energy conservation can play. The president has also retreated from his campaign promises on power plant emissions standards, and from the Clinton administration's commitment to reducing greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>Governor Pataki has publicly second-guessed the president, for whom he campaigned last year on several environmental policies. Meanwhile, the Democrats who are running against Mr. Pataki, Andrew M. Cuomo, the former United States housing secretary, and State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, are reminding audiences of President Bush's environmental record and of the governor's ties to the president. And environmental groups, frustrated at developments in Washington, have put intense pressure on the governor to take a leading role in fighting air pollution and global warming.</p>
        <p>The governor's advisers said that with his latest moves, Mr. Pataki was taking another big step away from the president. ''It's good policy and good politics,'' a top aide said.</p>
        <p>The governor, who announced last month that he would create a task force on greenhouse gas reduction, named its members today and told them to deliver recommendations in November. Mr. Cahill said it was too soon to say whether the task force would recommend specific percentage targets for reducing carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, as environmentalists have sought.</p>
        <p>The panel does not include the environmental groups that have been the governor's harshest critics on air quality and global warming, like the Sierra Club, the New York Public Interest Research Group and Environmental Advocates. Instead, it includes more muted adversaries like David R. Wooley, senior fellow at Pace University's Center for Environmental Legal Studies, and James T. B. Tripp, general counsel of Environmental Defense. Another member is Paul Elston, chairman of the League of Conservation Voters, who is very close to the governor.</p>
        <p>Industry executives on the task force include top officials of Ford Motor Company; Orion Power, a major power plant owner; and Niagara Mohawk, the largest upstate utility. Mr. Pataki also appointed several high-level state officials to the panel, including Mr. Cahill and Erin M. Crotty, the state commissioner of environmental conservation, which environmentalists took as a hopeful sign that the task would be taken seriously.</p>
        <p>The task force could deflect environmentalists' criticism of Mr. Pataki's approach to pollution from power plants that are more than 30 years old, which have been exempt from most emission controls. The administration is about to impose some of the nation's toughest emissions rules for those plants, which are major contributors to smog, acid rain and greenhouse gases. But the state standards will deal only with nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxides, which disappointed environmentalists who wanted them to include carbon dioxide and mercury, as well.</p>
        <p>The president promised a nationwide rule on the four pollutants during last year's campaign, then backed away from that pledge after taking office. Environmentalists have called on states to adopt a four-pollutant approach. Massachusetts recently became the first to do so.</p>
        <p>There are two bills in Congress to impose national standards on older plants for all four pollutants, one sponsored by Representatives Sherwood Boehlert, a Republican of New York, and Henry Waxman, a Democrat of California, and the other by Senators Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat of New York, and James M. Jeffords of Vermont, an independent. Environmental groups have pressed the governor to endorse one or both of those bills, but he has refrained.</p>
