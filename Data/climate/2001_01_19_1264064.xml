        <p>Following are Gale A. Norton's opening statement yesterday at her confirmation hearing for secretary of the interior and excerpts from questions and answers between Ms. Norton and Senators Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico; Frank H. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska; and Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, as recorded by Federal News Service Inc.:</p>
        <p>Ms. Norton</p>
        <p>I'm glad to have this chance to tell you something about the goals that President-elect Bush and I share and which we hope to achieve, if you see fit to confirm me as secretary of the interior.</p>
        <p>As you all know, America is a land of singular beauty. Americans are proud of the many exquisite national treasures within our shores. President-elect Bush believes, as I do, that the top priority of the Department of the Interior must be to conserve those natural treasures. One of President-elect Bush's priorities is to protect our national park system. We plan to return scientists to our parks and to work with Congress to eliminate the major maintenance backlogs that have been obstacles to resource protection, and to do that within five years.  This initiative would help restore our national parks and ensure a positive legacy of protecting our cultural, natural and recreational treasures for Americans today and in the future.</p>
        <p>The great wild places and unspoiled landscapes of this country are the common heritage of all Americans, and we must both conserve them and manage them for Americans living today, and for the Americans of the future, our children and our children's children. That is our goal. I don't think any of us here today would disagree on that goal. In that, I believe, lies the basis for common ground. We have the opportunity for bipartisan environmental cooperation and leadership.</p>
        <p>I've worked for more than 20 years on environmental issues. I'm proud of my accomplishments: preserving endangered species, cleaning up mountain valleys polluted by mining, working to convert the Rocky Mountain Arsenal from a place polluted by pesticides and nerve gas residues to a wildlife refuge.</p>
        <p>Based on these experiences, I am firmly committed to a process of consultation and collaboration. We should listen to all voices and involve all citizens. That is fair. It is also wise. People are a magnificent resource for ideas, for knowledge, for insights.</p>
        <p>I've lived and worked here in Washington.  I have also lived and worked in the great American West. Those of us here in Washington need to be good partners with Americans living in other parts of this country and in our territories. America is a stronger nation because of the diversity of its people. These people hold many different views and perspectives. We need to work with them, to involve them, to benefit from their creativity and their capacity to innovate.</p>
        <p>One top priority that I want to mention to you today concerns the special responsibilities of the secretary of the interior with regard to American Indians. I think we should all recognize that the situation in Indian country is not as it should be. There is much that I believe we can do, in partnership with our nation's proud Native American tribes, to improve conditions and provide a more hopeful future.</p>
        <p>President-elect Bush has said many times that he will leave no child behind. To accomplish that requires that we improve the schools that serve more than 50,000 Native American children. A good education is the key to a better life for any child, whether that child lives in Washington, D.C., or Miami, Fla., or on a reservation in New Mexico.</p>
        <p>Recognizing the historic relationship of the federal government and native American tribal governments, I will work very hard to achieve real results for every Indian child.</p>
        <p>President-elect Bush has proposals to build conservation partnerships, to help states, local communities and private landowners to conserve wildlife habitat, watersheds and open space. I'm excited by the chance to work together on these proposals. Working together, there is much that we can do to promote conservation in the United States.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, I will be candid in telling you that I am both a conservative and a conservationist. I see no conflict there. In fact, I am a compassionate conservative and a passionate conservationist. I believe that, too, is entirely consistent.</p>
        <p>If confirmed as secretary of the interior, I intend to make the conservation of America's natural resources my top priority. Using consultation and collaboration, forging partnerships with interested citizens, we can succeed in our effort to conserve America's most precious places. What's more, we can achieve this while maintaining America's prosperity and economic dynamism, while respecting constitutional rights and nurturing diverse traditions and cultures.</p>
        <p>It won't always be easy. It will require a lot of hard work and the willingness to be creative, to think outside the usual boxes.</p>
        <p>That is the mission that President-elect Bush has asked me to undertake. With your help, your wisdom and your cooperation, I believe that we can succeed.</p>
        <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        <p>Questions and Answers</p>
        <p>SENATOR BINGAMAN -- A few years ago, according to writing that you did, you described yourself as a free-market conservative, an advocate of judicial restraint, as well as a champion of states' rights. And over the years, you have taken some positions on the takings clause, for example, on the federal taxing power, on the 10th  Amendment, on the now long-discredited theory about economic due process, which seem, at least as I read some of those earlier writings of yours, to be at odds with mainstream legal thought.</p>
        <p>Can you give this committee assurance that if confirmed, you would feel comfortable enforcing the existing laws and regulations of the Department of Interior as they now stand?</p>
        <p>MS. NORTON -- Mr. Chairman, I have served eight years in the capacity of the state attorney general, enforcing the laws of Colorado and of the United States. And I feel very comfortable in enforcing the laws as they are written. I will be fully committed to ensuring that our nation's environmental laws and laws for the protection of natural resources will be fully enforced.</p>
        <p>Q. Many of the Republican members of Congress, some on this committee, have been sharply critical of the environmental initiatives and policies of Secretary Babbitt and of President Clinton and his administration. Which, if any, of those legal or policy positions that have been adopted by the Department of Interior during this last eight years would you depart from or attempt to change?</p>
        <p>A. There are many things that have been adopted over the past few years. We will be looking at what needs to be changed, in our views, and the many things that will remain the same. We will examine issues across the board and apply the best legal standards, as well as the views that I believe many of us would share, to ensure that we are doing the best to preserve our natural resources. At this point, I'm not sure where we may depart from the past administration, but we will carefully examine those things and work with this Congress in order to examine issues.</p>
        <p>Q. One issue that the president and the secretary of interior, the current secretary of interior, have been roundly criticized about by Republicans here in the Congress is this issue of designation of national monuments. I believe this president has designated 19 areas as national monuments under the authority that he has under the Antiquities Act. Do you believe that the president's use of that Antiquities Act, President Clinton's use of that Antiquities Act, was appropriate or not?</p>
        <p>A. The goal of preserving lands is an admirable goal, and I share the goal of trying to be sure that we are identifying those areas that ought to be natural treasures and setting those aside. The process in which those decisions were made is one that causes me concern. Many of those decisions were made through a top-down process without consulting the people who are most affected by those decisions. President-elect Bush has established his view, and I certainly share that, that decisions about the land should be made in a process that includes the people who are affected by those decisions.</p>
        <p>And I would certainly hope that in the future we would hear input from those of you on this committee, from governors, from local communities before we take actions that are going to deeply impact people's lives.</p>
        <p>Q. Would you advocate repeal of the Antiquities Act or some changes in that basic statute?</p>
        <p>A. The Antiquities Act is something that has been very useful in the past. It has shown its ability to preserve some of our most important national monuments. I would like to see a process of involvement of the people most affected by decisions. That certainly would be the practice that would be followed in a Bush administration if I am selected to be secretary of the interior. Whether that would require changes in that statute for the long term is a decision that I have not made in terms of what we would advocate and  obviously would require Congressional action in order to make any of those changes.  . . .</p>
        <p>SENATOR MURKOWSKI -- Do you feel that you can bring together within this new administration the wherewithal and the policy makers to resolve and make some decisions about how we're going to relieve our dependence on imports of 56 percent going up to, we heard this morning, 62 by the year 2004? Our greatest source seems to be coming now from Saddam Hussein. We fought a war in '92; we lost 147 lives. We can't address what to do with our nuclear waste.  Oil prices continue to go up. We're looking towards natural gas; now we're using it faster than we're finding it. You're going to have to come up with some of these answers with your collective colleagues. How do you propose to do it?</p>
        <p>A. The issue of Americans being so dependent on foreign oil is, obviously, a great cause for concern. The idea that people in California, this very day, are facing serious shortages of energy is another great cause of  concern. We will have to pull together all of our resources and work across departmental lines to find ways of addressing those issues.</p>
        <p>Obviously, it's going to be difficult to find short-term answers. We'll have to do a lot of planning to be able to find long-term answers. We would hope to work with you to find the right kinds of solutions that would balance environmental protection, as well as finding ways of providing the kind of energy resources that need to be available.</p>
        <p>Q. I think it's appropriate that I bring up the issue of ANWR [Alaska National Wildlife Refuge], because some would be disappointed if I didn't. In any event, many members of our environmental community have opposed your nomination because of the president-elect's position on environmentally responsible oil and gas exploration in that small portion of the Arctic coastal plain in my state of Alaska. However, the reality is you nor the president currently has the authority to open up this area. Only Congress has that authority.</p>
        <p>And in this regard, I have two questions for you. If Congress is to undertake the debate on this issue, will you commit to aid those debates with the very best science available from the Department of Interior?</p>
        <p>A. Absolutely. I view the role of the Department of Interior as helping provide the information to this Congress so that you can make an informed decision. We hope to look at the issues of how we can provide the best scientific evaluation of the environmental consequences, how we can do any exploration and production, if it is done, in the absolute most environmentally conscious way that we can have that happen.</p>
        <p>Q. My second question is, if Congress approves a measure to allow exploration and development of the coastal plain and it becomes law, will you uphold the law Congress passes and use all the powers afforded to you to mitigate any potential negative environmental consequences?</p>
        <p>A. I will certainly follow any laws that are passed, to be sure that the protection of the important resources of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge are preserved at the same time that any exploration or production would take place.</p>
        <p>Q. Thank you. Now moving over to Prudhoe Bay, which was discovered 30-some odd years ago. In the search for oil in Prudhoe Bay, which has been providing this nation with about 20 percent of the total domestic crude oil produced for some 27 years, and it's falling off now as Prudhoe Bay declines, but not looking for it, but as a sidelight, we found some 36 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Nobody paid much attention to it because of the cost of getting that gas out when gas was $2.16 per thousand cubic feet, which is what it was a year ago. Now gas is $8.40.  And as we look at our reserves and the fact that we're pulling down our reserves, there is more and more thought given to marketing that gas.</p>
        <p>In order for this to become a reality it's going to take a transportation system and it's going to require an investment of about $10 billion, the largest single construction project that would be on the horizon, and larger than anything that we've undertaken in this country.</p>
        <p>Should the owners of the gas decide to move forward with such a project, the Department of Interior, through the Joint Pipeline Office, will have an awful lot to say about the permitting and development. My question to you is, if confirmed, will you act in your role as secretary to provide all the resources needed to the Joint Pipeline Office in Alaska to help expedite a project of this magnitude if indeed it becomes a reality?</p>
        <p>A. I'm aware of the important need for natural gas not just because our economy is expanding and there's more demand for energy, but also because natural gas is seen as one of the ways of having the cleanest supply of energy. So it's important for us to have some mechanisms to be able to draw  upon gas resources.</p>
        <p>I will look forward to working with you to learn more about that issue. It's not one that I have had the opportunity, obviously, to discuss the details on. I will look forward to working with you so that we can resolve that issue. . . .</p>
        <p>SENATOR DORGAN -- You have written that there is little consensus over whether global warming is occurring. Do you think there's any kind of a scientific consensus at all that there is some significant climate change occurring or global warming occurring?</p>
        <p>A. Global warming is an issue that has seen scientific information developing over time.  And the further we go through the process, the more information we have available.</p>
        <p>The article that you referred to is something that was written several years ago. I will maintain an open mind and receive new scientific information as it is put forward.</p>
        <p>Q. But my question is, do you think there's a consensus on any side of this issue? Some would say, you know, while there are doubters, certainly, and some respected doubters, there seems to be a fairly overwhelming consensus among most scientists that something is occurring in the area of global warming. Do you share that view?</p>
        <p>A. It does seem, based on my evaluation, which is not a scientific one, that there is beginning to be more of a consensus that global warming is occurring. There is still disagreement as to the causes and the long-term future. And obviously, there is disagreement about what ought to be done in that regard. I will certainly rely on scientific information as it becomes available and evaluate the information as it is presented to me.</p>
