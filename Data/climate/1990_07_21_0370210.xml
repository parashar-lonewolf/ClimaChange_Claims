        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Plant Trees. Then Protect Them'' (editorial, July 2) outlines an approach to the threat of global warming by enlisting ''ordinary people'' as urban foresters. At Texaco, we have joined with Global ReLeaf, a program of the 115-year-old American Forestry Association, in just such an approach.</p>
        <p>Last spring, Texaco embarked on tree planting in Houston, New Orleans and Denver, where we have sizable work forces. We have committed $1 million to this urban initiative for 1990, which includes funds and equipment for local land management agencies that undertake maintenance of the trees for at least two years. In Houston, water-tank trucks provided by Texaco helped bring this spring's planting of trees virtually intact through an unusually hot and dry early summer. In Denver, an irrigation system provided by Texaco supports newly planted trees.</p>
        <p>We do not view our tree planting as just another philanthropic program. Rather, it is a companywide commitment of resources and the efforts and talent of thousands of enthusiastic Texaco people and their families, working on their own time. Their goal is a healthier and more enjoyable environment for generations to come. In the fall, we will expand our involvement to other communities where Texaco has interests. From the perspective of our goal of involving other businesses, their employees and other citizens in the Global ReLeaf program, we were delighted by your editorial.</p>
