        <p>WHAT looks at first like a snake is actually an undulating colony of bungalows in a Florida swamp. A splotch of turquoise is really one of the alligator rivers in Australia's Kakadu National Park. Scattered toothpicks turn out to be hundreds of trees that have been stripped from a rain forest and are being floated to market.</p>
        <p>These are some of the images in ''Earth From Above,'' an extraordinary book by the French photographer Yann Arthus-Bertrand. Giant prints of 120 of his aerial pictures will be displayed from Friday to Sept. 15, at an outdoor show in Chicago.

        <p>WHAT looks at first like a snake is actually an undulating colony of bungalows in a Florida swamp. A splotch of turquoise is really one of the alligator rivers in Australia's Kakadu National Park. Scattered toothpicks turn out to be hundreds of trees that have been stripped from a rain forest and are being floated to market.</p>
        <p>These are some of the images in ''Earth From Above,'' an extraordinary book by the French photographer Yann Arthus-Bertrand. Giant prints of 120 of his aerial pictures will be displayed from Friday to Sept. 15, at an outdoor show in Chicago. The show has been mounted in dozens of cities around the world, but this is its first stop in the United States.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bertand photographed remote wilderness and famous monuments like the Versailles palace and the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul. Some of his pictures depict wild creatures: a huge flock of pink flamingos, a pair of elephants emerging from a swamp, a camel caravan casting elongated shadows on desert sand. He captures nude sunbathers on the Canary Islands and African tribesmen in dugout canoes. There are pictures that refer to political events, like a tank graveyard in Iraq that bears testimony to the destructive power of the United States Army, and pictures of the aftermath of natural catastrophes, like the earthquake that struck Turkey in 1999.</p>
        <p>Colors are vivid and in some cases unexpected. Even more startling are the patterns in views of cities, farms, lakes, glaciers, mountains and other formations both natural and manufactured. Many photographs resemble abstract paintings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bertrand took these pictures in 70 countries over five years. He worked from helicopters and ultra-light aircraft at altitudes of 90 to 9,000 feet, logging 3,000 hours in the air and taking 100,000 shots.</p>
        <p>''Earth From Above,'' originally published in France, has sold more than 1.5 million copies. The American version, published by Harry N. Abrams, is accompanied by essays by scientists and ecologists on topics like urbanization, climate change and over-population.</p>
        <p>These topics reflect Mr. Bertrand's interest in using photography to convey something beyond beauty. There are scenes of environmental devastation: erosion cuts through a hillside of Madagascar and nomadic herdsmen tend cattle in a dry Kenyan river bed.</p>
        <p>''I don't take photographs to be pretty,'' Mr. Bertrand said. ''I want to explain things. People can get information from pictures that they can't get from texts. The problem of the next century is not going to be people confronting each other, like Israelis and Palestinians, but people confronting the environment. My pictures are about this confrontation.''</p>
        <p>In Chicago's Millennium Park, on Michigan Avenue near Lake Michigan, 4-foot-by-6-foot prints are on display, laminated to protect them from sunlight and rain. At night the show will be illuminated by solar-powered lights.</p>
        <p>''I am only interested in exhibiting on the street, not in museums or galleries,'' Mr. Bertrand said. ''The pictures make people stop, and then they read the captions. That's how I reach them.''</p>
