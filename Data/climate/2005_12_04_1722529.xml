        <p>Although it was informative to read an article about the shrinking federal budget for research on Long Island, it was also disappointing that your article did not even mention the plight of university laboratories.

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Although it was informative to read an article about the shrinking federal budget for research on Long Island, it was also disappointing that your article did not even mention the plight of university laboratories. Many of us with active research laboratories in academic institutions are also experiencing difficulties in obtaining federal grants for our research.</p>
        <p>In addition to the shrinking budget of the National Institutes of Health, the budget of another important source of federal money, the National Science Foundation, has already been slashed by over 5 percent (more than $100 million).</p>
        <p>Although all the reasons for the decline in research dollars may be valid (war in Iraq, antiterrorism activities, hurricane recovery), there is yet another greater one: we have an uncurious president who is not interested in basic research, does not accept scientific discovery and knowledge (greenhouse effect, evolution) and even prevents federal financing altogether on other important areas like therapeutic cloning and embryonic stem cell research.</p>
        <p>Collectively, this amounts to an active assault by the Bush administration on science, basic research and technological advancement, the engine of our society.</p>
