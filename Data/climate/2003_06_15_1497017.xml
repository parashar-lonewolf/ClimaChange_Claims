        <p>LAST summer I tried to take refuge from a sticky, frenzied city in the Museum of Natural History, heading for the most tranquil and contemplative of all its spaces: the Hall of Ocean Life and Biology of Fishes.</p>
        <p>But that hall, home to the fiberglass blue whale that had been suspended for three decades over many stories of near darkness, was no longer, at least as I'd known it. The name of the hall had lost its biblically evocative ''fishes'' portion and become a truncated ''Ocean Life,'' and the whole thing was ''temporarily closed for renovations.'' By then it had been closed several months.</p>
        <p>The term ''renovation'' caused me shivers. I had been less than thrilled with some of the museum's previous renovations, like the 1994 transformation of the aging Hall of Man into the Hall of Human Biology and Evolution, a dismal arcade of holograms and interactive kiosks. And I worried that my favorite hall, a cavernous marvel whose captions were witty and whose silences yielded only to the sporadic buzz of dying light bulbs, would meet a similar fate.</p>
        <p>It was a wonderful place. Looking up at the whale's belly from the ground floor could put one awash in Freud's ''oceanic feeling,'' a generic serenity, fear of drowning, or deep religiosity. The hall's darkness was underpatrolled; one could sit on the carpet of the mezzanine for an hour or a day. Occasionally a game of tag broke out among schoolchildren, sending some banging against the glass, but silence always prevailed. Something about the hall commanded it.</p>
        <p>Perhaps a little sprucing up was inevitable. Ocean Life and Fishes was getting a crusty look toward the end, with a monitor playing burnt footage of a lionfish gulping its prey and a poster showing an experiment in which fish are cruelly blinded. But for the patient visitor, its provocations were many.</p>
        <p>It might have been my nostalgia that wanted the hall just as it was. It didn't help that I first saw the whale at the impressionable age of 7. Nostalgia is a defense, powerful but not rational. But I was also concerned about the hall's future as a contemplative, awe-inducing space. We can be wowed by lights and action, but real awe, the kind that sinks in, that causes us to return, requires quiet. Sometimes it also requires reading.</p>
        <p>The news release was not reassuring. In the $25 million renovation, it said, the hall would ''be transformed through current scientific research and cutting-edge exhibition technology into a fully immersive marine environment with video projections, interactive computer stations and new ocean dioramas.'' The whale would float in a ''virtual ocean,'' it continued, ''immersed in the dynamic and magnificent life of the ocean through dramatic cutting-edge effects created by lighting, video, and sound.''</p>
        <p>I brought my misgivings to Melanie Stiassny, the ichthyology curator who was overseeing the hall's transformation. She defended the changes with an interesting argument: that for all the cosmic thoughts the old hall may have nourished, few were about whales. Or fishes.</p>
        <p>''The whale,'' she said, ''is just hanging there. There's actually very little information on it. Did you know you could swim down its aorta? It's the biggest animal that's ever lived, never mind dinosaurs. But there's very little you actually learn about the whale in the whale hall. Did you ever come away knowing more about it?'' I did not, I admitted.</p>
        <p>The late naturalist Stephen Jay Gould, who was first taken to the museum at age 5 by his father, wrote a decade ago that the dinosaur and fossil mammal halls at the American Museum of Natural History were ''the shrine, the principal magic place, the sanctum sanctorum of my youth.'' The dinosaur and fossil mammal halls, before their 1994 overhauls, sported very little text, and it was largely outdated by then. But they were big on awe, and they were silent.</p>
        <p>I wonder if Dr. Gould, who returned to those halls almost monthly throughout his childhood and adolescence, learned much in them. Or did he take the emotions they elicited in him to the library, reliving each new chapter with a return to the sanctum?</p>
        <p>One afternoon in South American Peoples, I followed a mother and two daughters, about 10 and 12, around a case of shrunken heads. (If you cannot get a 10-year-old to stand still for a shrunken head, what will she stand still for?) ''Jesse,'' the mother said. ''Come here. Take a moment to read it.'' Jesse fidgeted, apparently wanting to join her sister. ''Shh,'' her mother said. ''Read.''</p>
        <p>The Tupari believe that at death the pupils of their eyes leave their body and they change into tiny blind beings called pabits. On their journey to the village of the dead the pabits are frightened by jaguars, threatened by evil shamans, and two giant worms eat their intestines.</p>
        <p>The girl stayed at her case, reconciling the leathery little faces with the paragraphs below them. Would she, like Dr. Gould, return in high school, or in graduate school? What if the heads had been rotating on platforms, accompanied by forest sounds?</p>
        <p>A FEW days later I spoke with Steve Quinn, a 30-year museum veteran and the senior project manager who oversees the art and design of new exhibits. He told me I was not alone in my concerns about gadgetry and the future of Ocean Life, minus fishes. ''A lot of people are disappointed about that being overhauled,'' he said.</p>
        <p>What was more important, I asked him, awe or information?</p>
        <p>''That's the great challenge of exhibit designers and artists who work within a science museum,'' he said, how to inform using ''awe and wonder as the hook.''</p>
        <p>''I can recall my first visit like it was yesterday,'' he added, ''going through the corridor from the rotunda through the Akeley African Hall and seeing the big elephant, and that image is permanently etched into my memory.'' I wondered whether the designers of the giant blue whale model had cynically understood that they were creating a generation strangely attracted to it for life.</p>
        <p>What curators want, Mr. Quinn added, ''is to maintain these nostalgic icons that provide a very visceral kind of epiphany.''</p>
        <p>''Not just because they are nostalgic icons,'' he said, ''but because they're effective -- the dioramas, the blue whale. But at the same time take them and incorporate them into the ecosystems they lived in and share with this great community of things.'' In other words, I thought, the whale would become conservation chum -- luring the nostalgically attached into caring about oceans, ecosystems, global warming.</p>
        <p>Last Monday I visited the new Milstein Hall of Ocean Life, and it was the busiest I'd ever seen it. The revamped hall and its dioramas are gorgeous, though the dull roar of whale sounds has replaced its former quiet. The blue whale is slimmer but no less tremendous. And there is a great deal of information presented, efficiently and systematically, on every ocean habitat, though I found myself staring mostly at a flat-screen monitor showing seals swimming.</p>
        <p>If a new generation of whale-lovers learns something here, it might be a fair, if sad, trade-off: sounds for silence, information for contemplation, facts for poetry.</p>
        <p>On Monday I saw a little boy shine his penlight into one of the hall's best and scariest dioramas, a sperm whale battling a giant squid. He found the sperm whale's terrifying eye with his beam. Then he turned his attention to the factoids below him. His mother, however, had had enough.</p>
        <p>''Let's go,'' she said. ''You can't read everything.''</p>
