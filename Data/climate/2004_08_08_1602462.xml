      <block class="full_text">
        <p>NOT long ago, Steve Brozak was a little-known Marine officer who had returned home to Westfield from a tour of duty in Iraq, disillusioned with President Bush's handling of the war there.</p>
        <p>But late last month, Mr. Brozak -- an investment banker from this upscale community in Union County -- found himself in the national spotlight with a coveted prime-time speaking role at the Democratic National Convention in Boston. Personally, it marked an extraordinary milestone for the 43-year-old Mr. Brozak, a former lieutenant colonel who had been a registered Republican his entire adult life -- until about a year ago.</p>
        <p>Yet the turn of events that culminated in his unlikely celebrity at the Democratic Party's premier event are easy enough to explain, given the highly charged political atmosphere of this election season.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brozak's deeply felt belief that the Bush administration has mishandled the war on terrorism and in Iraq, along with his very public break with the Republican Party, caught the attention of national Democratic leaders who have spent months trying to recruit candidates nationwide to help their party blunt the edge that Republicans have long enjoyed in the politically potent area of national defense.</p>
        <p>In that context, the Democrats tapped Mr. Brozak -- a social moderate and fiscal conservative -- to run against Representative Mike Ferguson, a two-term Republican who represents New Jersey's Seventh Congressional District in a race that has already drawn a disproportionate amount of national attention.</p>
        <p>''If you told me 18 months ago that I would end up addressing the Democratic convention, I would have said you were crazy,'' Mr. Brozak told a hall packed with delegates. ''I have never considered myself a partisan person, but the Republican Party left me behind. And so I had no choice but to leave the Republican Party behind.''</p>
        <p>Leading Democrats in New Jersey and Washington say they see particular promise in the Brozak-Ferguson contest, contending that it is one of a handful of races around the nation that could play a major role in their battle to take back the House of Representatives this fall. For now, Republicans outnumber Democrats 228 to 206, with one independent.</p>
        <p>It is easy to see why Democrats are so emboldened.</p>
        <p>Moderate Republicans like Mr. Ferguson have found themselves in something of a political bind as many of the president's policies -- from his handling of the war in Iraq to his support for a Constitutional ban on gay marriage -- have proven unpopular in Democratic-leaning states like New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Democrats are eager to exploit this situation, trying to tie moderate Republicans like Mr. Ferguson to President Bush's agenda -- as well as to that of Representative Tom DeLay of Texas and other conservatives who control the House.</p>
        <p>The Democratic strategy is evident in the lines of attack employed by Mr. Brozak, who in a recent interview in Boston noted that Mr. Ferguson has voted with the House Republican leadership 92 percent of the time.</p>
        <p>''He acts like he's a middle-of-the-road guy,'' Mr. Brozak said of his rival, just a few hours before taking the stage at the convention. ''But that's not the case. He doesn't talk about the things that the people of New Jersey care about. He's not an independent voice for the district or the state.''</p>
        <p>But Republicans strongly disagree with that characterization, noting that Mr. Ferguson -- who was voted into office along with President Bush in 2000 -- has done an effective job of establishing his independence and distancing himself from some of the more conservative social policies advanced by the president and House Republican leaders.</p>
        <p>Ferguson Fights Back</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Ferguson, he scoffed at the charges that Democrats are lobbing at him and vigorously argued that he is his own man politically.</p>
        <p>''I'm an independent thinker,'' the 33-year-old Mr. Ferguson said. ''When I think the president is wrong, when I think my Republican leadership is wrong, I don't hesitate to stand up to them and be an independent voice for New Jersey.''</p>
        <p>Political analysts in Washington are intrigued by the race shaping up, saying that there is more than election-year hype to Democratic claims that they have a shot of winning the seat, particularly in light of the uncertainty over the war in Iraq and an economy that is still struggling to recover lost jobs. But they concede that it will be an uphill battle for Democrats to dislodge Mr. Ferguson in a district that still tends to vote Republican despite the overall Democratic leanings of New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Stuart Rothenberg, a veteran nonpartisan analyst of congressional races who publishes a political newsletter, said he has included the Seventh Congressional District among the 44 seats that are in play this fall.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rothenberg said that at this point, the seat is leaning toward staying in Republican hands, although he acknowledged that the general election was nearly 100 days off and that much could happen between now and November to weaken Republican odds.</p>
        <p>''Ferguson is vulnerable,'' Mr. Rothenberg said. ''But the race is not one of the Democrats' best opportunities, and Brozak has received more ink and more hype than he really deserves at this point.''</p>
        <p>New Jersey's Seventh Congressional District is largely made up of some of the state's wealthiest communities: Warren, Bedminster, Bridgewater and Summit, to name a few. Indeed, it has the highest median household income of the 13 congressional districts in the state, about $86,000 a year.</p>
        <p>Anyone who wanders through the heart of the district will find mammoth houses set far back from street on sprawling lots. The parking lots at the upscale shopping centers dotting the district are all packed with expensive S.U.V.'s and luxury cars from Mercedes-Benz and Acura to BMW.</p>
        <p>At this early stage, there is little evidence in downtowns throughout the district that there is a major battle taking shape for the local congressional seat. There are no signs for George W. Bush or John Kerry, much less Mr. Ferguson or Mr. Brozak.</p>
        <p>Democrats have been after Mr. Ferguson since he first won election in 2000, mindful that he eked out his victories in a district that voted overwhelmingly for Vice President Al Gore.</p>
        <p>In 2002, Democrats made a big play for the district, spending nearly a million dollars in an effort to elect Tim Carden, who had been commissioner of the state Department of Human Services. Then, as now, Democrats sought to cast Mr. Ferguson as staunchly conservative, a man who supported Mr. Bush and like-minded House leaders on policies that were out of step with the district's more moderate political sensibilities.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Ferguson had positioned himself in a way that helped insulate him against Democratic charges that he was unwilling to stand up to his party's dominant conservative wing. In one vote after another, he defied Mr. Bush, particularly on environmental and educational issues.</p>
        <p>For instance, he joined the former Representative Marge Roukema, a famously moderate Republican who represented a northern stretch of the state from Bergen to Warren County, in sending a letter to President Bush after the administration reversed itself on placing certain limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ferguson also spoke out against the Bush administration's proposal to allow oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge -- as well as its decision to reconsider a Clinton-era policy that called for cutting the amount of naturally occurring arsenic in municipal drinking water.</p>
        <p>He also defied Republican congressional leaders in seeking full financing for special education programs. This was all the more remarkable because he had an unlikely ally: Representative Patrick J. Kennedy of Rhode Island, the former head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee who traveled to New Jersey in 2000 to campaign against Mr. Ferguson.</p>
        <p>In the end, Mr. Ferguson won a second term, defeating Mr. Carden 58 percent to 41 percent, leading his advisers to hope that he would help ward off future challenges.</p>
        <p>And for their part, Mr. Ferguson's advisers say he has good reason to be confident this time around as well. Even as Mr. Brozak attacks him as too conservative for an increasingly Democratic state like New Jersey, Mr. Ferguson's advisers say they have plenty of reason to believe that his challenger's complaints will fall largely on deaf ears in the Seventh District, where one Republican after another has had great success.</p>
        <p>For example, the former Representative Bob Franks received 59 percent of the vote in the district in the 2000 United States Senate race that he lost to Jon Corzine. And Douglas R. Forrester defeated Frank R. Lautenberg by 10 percent in the district in the 2002 Senate race, even though Mr. Lautenberg went on to beat him by the same margin statewide.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rothenberg, the political analyst, does not think this is election-year spin by the Ferguson camp. He pointed out that even Bret D. Schundler, a man Democrats successfully cast as a right-wing extremist in the gubernatorial race that he lost to James E. McGreevey in 2001, ran competitively in the Seventh District.</p>
        <p>''Generally, Republicans do well in the district,'' he said. ''Bret Schundler almost won that district, and Bret Schundler is extremely conservative.''</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Mr. Brozak is bent on making his opponent's support for conservative causes a central issue of the campaign -- noting that the congressman voted with the Republican leadership 92 percent of the time. In particular, Mr. Brozak and his campaign surrogates are taking aim at Mr. Ferguson's opposition to abortion, his opposition to embryonic stem-cell research and his support for a constitutional ban on gay marriage, to name a few issues.</p>
        <p>''No one has ever held him accountable for his record,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Brozak Relies on Record</p>
        <p>Mr. Brozak is also clearly hoping that his military background will give people another compelling reason to support him, particularly since polls show that many voters are uneasy about the way President Bush and his advisers are conducting the war in Iraq.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brozak, who served four years on active duty and then 18 years in the reserves, volunteered for service in Haiti, Bosnia and Kuwait and Iraq. He retired after serving as a military spokesman in Arlington, Va., as well as the Middle East during the troop buildup leading up to the latest war in Iraq.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brozak said he started growing disillusioned with the Republican Party during the 2000 primary season, when Senator John McCain -- who was vying with George W. Bush for the Republican presidential nomination -- suggested that leaders of the religious right might have been behind phone calls and e-mail messages to South Carolina voters accusing him of fathering illegitimate children and pointing out that he and his wife, Cindy, had adopted a dark-skinned daughter from Bangladesh.</p>
        <p>He said he became even more upset that year when Republicans mounted a successful campaign against Max Cleland, a Democratic senator from Georgia who was seeking re-election. They questioned the patriotism of Mr. Cleland, who had lost both legs and an arm in the Vietnam War. ''It was vicious,'' he said. ''I said: 'This is no longer my party. It's been taken over by a small group with this win-at-any-cost mentality.'''</p>
        <p>Very much like the Democrat at the top of this year's ticket -- Senator John Kerry -- Mr. Brozak has used his military credentials as a base from which to attack the war as an ill-conceived adventure that is draining the federal treasury and undercutting the global fight against terrorism.</p>
        <p>The war was, in fact, a central theme of his speech.</p>
        <p>''My friends, Iraq is filled with professional soldiers, patriotic reservists and Guard members who long for a mission that is planned and purposeful,'' he told the Democrats assembled at the FleetCenter in Boston. ''If you want to support our troops, if you want to help their families, if you want to build a nation that is the envy and not the enemy of the world, I ask you to join us tonight in this fight: Help make John Kerry the president of the United States.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ferguson, for his part, has offered only qualified support for the job Mr. Bush has been doing as commander in chief.</p>
        <p>While he praises the president's efforts to fight terrorism -- by toppling the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, for example -- he has raised questions about how the war in Iraq is being handled.</p>
        <p>''Americans and New Jerseyans are rightly concerned about the situation in Iraq,'' he said in an interview several days ago. ''I think the administration underestimated the strength of the resistance in the post-war planning.''</p>
        <p>Republicans Are Gleeful</p>
        <p>Republicans close to Mr. Ferguson acknowledge that Mr. Brozak's biography is an impressive political asset. But at the same time, they are rubbing their hands with glee that Mr. Brozak's campaign appears to have many of the rough edges and built-in disadvantages that come with being a political novice.</p>
        <p>For one thing, Mr. Brozak has been struggling to raise money, though independent political analysts say he has managed to bring in enough cash to keep his campaign viable at this point.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brozak had $204,743 on hand as of June 30, compared with about $420,000 that Mr. Ferguson's previous opponent had at the same point two years ago, according to campaign finance records. More than that, Mr. Ferguson has amassed an impressive $1,035,244 so far.</p>
        <p>Beyond that, Mr. Ferguson and his advisers say they are puzzled by Mr. Brozak's decision to criticize the Bush tax cuts, predicting that that stance will not play well among the well-off voters in the district.</p>
        <p>The Ferguson camp says that Mr. Brozak's position on taxes would make sense if he were in battle for his party's nomination and had to embrace positions that might appeal to liberal-leaning primary voters. But that is not the case.</p>
        <p>''It's a big deal in New Jersey, but it's particularly a big deal in our district,'' Mr. Ferguson said, referring to the issue of tax cuts. ''My opponent has not missed an opportunity to say he would raise taxes. You'd think he was running in a Democratic primary trying to go as left as you can go.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Brozak said that his Republican rival was distorting his position on taxes, and in defending himself he went so far as to say that he recently rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange and delivered a speech advocating the elimination of the capital gains tax for pharmaceutical companies engaged in research and development.</p>
        <p>As for the president's tax cuts, he said he would eliminate those benefiting corporations that are outsourcing jobs overseas. But he did not rule out eliminating other portions of the Bush tax cut, arguing that local governments have had to raise taxes to make up for reductions in aid from Washington.</p>
        <p>'A Deficit Crisis'</p>
        <p>''We have a deficit crisis,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Finally, Mr. Brozak's campaign style has drawn considerable attention among national pundits who were gathered in Boston with relatively little to actually write about. In a recent column in Roll Call, a weekly Washington newspaper, Mr. Rothenberg referred to Mr. Brozak's ''prickly personality and cockiness.''</p>
        <p>And that was mild compared with the ridicule heaped on him by The Weekly Standard, a tart conservative opinion journal. ''With his left arm rigidly stuck to his side, his right waves wildly in the close-fisted point that they teach you these days during the first lesson of Public Speaking 101,'' Jonathan V. Last wrote in a column after the candidate spoke at the convention. ''It's supposed to be a gesture that's strong, but not threatening. But in Brozak's hands, it's frightening and ludicrous and wildly entertaining. The train wreck goes on and on and on.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Brozak dismissed the criticism as partisan sniping, saying he has received widespread praise for his speech.</p>
        <p>''I am appreciative of the fact that they are that concerned about me. That shows you how desperate they are getting.''</p>
