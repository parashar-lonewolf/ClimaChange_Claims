        <p>AFTER the space walks, Moon walks and various orbital loop-the-loops, now comes the high wire act.</p>
        <p>On the next space shuttle mission, scheduled for launching on Friday, American astronauts will try something new and daring. They plan to reel out a half-ton satellite at the end of a wire 12 miles long. Then the shuttle and the satellite, always connected by the thin wire, are to fly a duet round and round the world, before the satellite is reeled back into the shuttle's cargo bay.</p>
        <p>This will be the first large-scale demonstration of tethered space flight, an intriguing concept seriously contemplated for the last 20 years. Space agency officials say the experiment is probably the most complex one attempted by shuttle astronauts and poses more than the usual risks of flying in space.</p>
        <p>Success could open the way to an entirely new technology. Future tether systems could be used to construct space stations and drop capsules of experimental material from a station for return to Earth. Tethers could lower scientific instruments from a shuttle for data gathering in the upper atmosphere and also could spin a spaceship to create artificial gravity for human missions to Mars.</p>
        <p>A critical test on this mission will be the use of the cable itself, 10 strands of copper wire wrapped in synthetic fiber and altogether no more than one-tenth of an inch thick, in generating electric power for spacecraft. Some engineers promoting the concept see the wire as a potential radio antenna, with applications in communicating with submerged submarines.</p>
        <p>But nothing is certain. As reassured as they are by simulations and their understanding of physics, engineers remember that in 1966 Gemini astronauts complained of wild gyrations when their spacecraft was tethered to a rocket shell by a 100-foot-long Dacron strap. So they will be monitoring closely and anxiously the dynamics of two huge weights whirling through orbit, joined by nothing more than a string. Will the wire be taut or slack? Will the satellite remain stable or start oscillating or swinging dangerously? Is there a chance the two craft could become entangled?</p>
        <p>The concern was sufficient for Daniel S. Goldin, head of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, to order an independent safety review a few months ago. The reviewers said they were satisfied that nothing had been overlooked in the planning. But not taking any chances, they conducted another study in recent weeks, reaching the same conclusion.</p>
        <p>Officials acknowledged that they would be happy with a partial success: the deployment of the satellite and testing of the wire dynamics, if not the retrieval. Trying to reel in the satellite, after about 36 hours of testing, could be especially tricky.</p>
        <p>"It's entirely possible we might not bring the satellite back," said Dr. Peter M. Banks, dean of engineering at the University of Michigan and one of the architects of the mission.</p>
        <p>Col. Loren J. Shriver of the Air Force, the shuttle commander, said that the crew and flight controllers had spent hours figuring out "some of the wildest things we can expect," and that they had developed countermeasures for all of them.</p>
        <p>If the satellite swings out of control and threatens to crash into the shuttle, or is otherwise unwieldy, flight controllers at the Johnson Space Center in Houston say, the astronauts can send commands to cut the tether. There should be ample time, they said, because in space the tether should move back and forth lazily, completing one pendulumlike swing in 45 minutes. Astronauts would not be asked to go outside the cabin to work on the experiment, except in an emergency.</p>
        <p>"This is really a discovery flight," said Dr. William F. Ballhaus Jr., president of the Martin Marietta Civil Space and Communications Company, which developed and built the tether system for NASA. "We want to demonstrate a concept, to see if you can put something out on a long string and see if it defies the laws of physics."</p>
        <p>On its planned seven-day mission, the shuttle Atlantis will first release a $400 million spacecraft called Eureca, for European Retrievable Carrier. Developed by the European Space Agency, the 4.5-ton craft is carrying instruments for physics experiments and growing crystals in the weightless environment of space. Eureca is designed to be retrieved by another shuttle in six to nine months.</p>
        <p>On Monday, if all goes well, the tethered satellite will be payed out slowly, unreeled from a drum by an electric motor and rising 12 miles above the shuttle's orbit of 185 miles. Thin as the wire is, the total 12-mile length weighs 350 pounds. Thrusters on the satellite would be fired to help position it and maintain tension on the wire.</p>
        <p>If the two craft were not connected, the satellite above would be traveling slightly more slowly than the shuttle below and would soon fall far behind. Being connected though, they will act as a single mass in orbit, their velocity controlled together by the forces of their forward momentum and Earth's gravity. Radio Engineer's Idea</p>
        <p>No one will be watching the progress of the flight more avidly than Dr. Mario D. Grossi, an Italian-born radio engineer at the Raytheon Corporation and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Mass. Tethered satellite flight was his idea more than any other person alive.</p>
        <p>In 1972 Dr. Grossi first proposed to NASA the idea of deploying a tether 12 to 65 miles long from a shuttle to act as a radio antenna for investigating the Earth's magnetic field or communicating with Earth.</p>
        <p>"I'm a radio engineer who has always been interested in antennas," Dr. Grossi said in an interview last week. "Back in Italy as a little boy, I was interested in flying kites and read about how Marconi created antennas out of wire flown from a kite. This looked like another way of doing what Marconi did."</p>
        <p>Two years later, Dr. Giuseppi Colombo, a University of Padua scientist who was also at the Smithsonian observatory, determined the tether's dynamic feasibility and recognized a host of other potential applications. As a student at Harvard University in the 1970's, Dr. Jeffrey A. Hoffman, one of the mission astronauts, said he remembered hearing this coterie of Italian scientists wax enthusiastic about spacecraft tethers.</p>
        <p>The magazine Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology quoted Dr. Hoffman as saying: "The initial reaction most people have when they learn we're about to attach a satellite to the shuttle with a 20-kilometer-long rope is the same I had in graduate school when I saw those Italians working down the hall: 'Oh my God! Why would they want to do that?' "</p>
        <p>Dr. Colombo did not live to see the mission. The 67-year-old Dr. Grossi was beginning to wonder if he would see any results himself. After NASA finally issued a contract for the tethered satellite system in 1982, everything was postponed indefinitely by the Challenger accident in 1986.</p>
        <p>The influence of the two men is seen in the strong Italian presence on the mission. The $160 million spherical satellite, five feet in diameter, was designed and paid for by the Italian Space Agency and built by Alenia, an Italian aerospace company. One of the seven crew members is Franco Malerba, the first Italian astronaut. Italian scientists and engineers have been active in mission planning.</p>
        <p>Although engineers will be waiting to see how easy, or hard, it is to release, control and retrieve a satellite on a string, scientists are particularly interested in learning how well the tether generates electricity as the shuttle and satellite sweep through Earth's magnetic field.</p>
        <p>At its orbital altitude, the Atlantis will be flying through Earth's ionosphere, the region above the atmosphere where charged particles and electrons are common and magnetic forces are strong. Electrons should collect on the surface of the satellite and flow down the conducting tether to the shuttle. There they will be returned to the ionosphere, which would effectively close the circuit needed to conduct electric current.</p>
        <p>In this way, the tether should generate 4,000 to 5,000 volts. As Dr. Banks explained, "The tether will function like the alternator in your car, moving rapidly through the Earth's electromagnetic field to generate electric potential."</p>
        <p>One of the most immediate applications of tethers could be to produce electricity to operate spacecraft. Dr. Brian E. Gilchrist, an electrical engineer at the University of Michigan, said, "Someday, we may be able to use an external electrical energy source to reverse the flow of current in the tether and use the energy to boost the orbits of space platforms or satellites."</p>
        <p>Another possible use would be to dangle capsules with instruments below a shuttle, down into the upper atmosphere. This is a region, above 60 miles, where airplanes do not fly and balloons and sounding rockets can get only sketchy data and into which satellites cannot dip. It is also a region of great scientific interest because of concerns over depletion of the protective ozone layer and climatic consequences of rising carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Federal Express in Space?</p>
        <p>Such a downward tether mission has been proposed to follow the current test. Different equipment would have to be developed because operating in the upper atmosphere would result in greater friction heat and dynamic pressures on the tether and capsule. But the mission has yet to be approved. "There's not much enthusiasm for the mission by NASA, unless Italy is willing to pay a large share," Dr. Grossi said.</p>
        <p>For the time being, the only authorized tests of tether technology involve modest piggyback flights on Air Force Delta 2 rockets, beginning next March. When the Delta's upper rocket stage reaches orbit, it is to deploy a 12-mile-long tether with a basketball-size capsule at the end. Instruments in the capsule are to measure the tether performance over a period of one orbit. The capsule will not be retrieved.</p>
        <p>This Small Expendable Deployer System, or SEDS, is being developed by NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., which also oversaw the design of the more elaborate equipment for the current test. James Harrison, manager of the SEDS project, said a second test with a Delta rocket was being planned for March 1994. One objective then, he said, would be to see if tethers could be used to drop a capsule into the atmosphere in such a way as to send it hurtling toward a precise spot for a landing on Earth.</p>
        <p>If feasible, Mr. Harrison said, tethered re-entry capsules "could serve like a Federal Express" to deliver experiment samples, film or even waste from an orbiting space station.</p>
        <p>Space designers have also conceived of tethers as the connective tissue holding together main components of a space station and of observatories strung out at the end of tethers, hundreds of miles away from the vibrations and contaminants of the station itself.</p>
        <p>If capsules were tethered to a Mars-bound spaceship, their thruster firings could induce a steady rotation of the larger vehicle more easily and with less fuel than could be achieved with its own rockets. A rotating spaceship would create artificial gravity to help overcome the potential problems of deconditioning of human bodies on interplanetary journeys taking many months.</p>
        <p>In their more visionary moments, some engineers and dreamers have expanded the tether concept to include "skyhooks" rising from Earth into deep space. In 1960, a Russian engineer, Y. N. Artsutanov, proposed a "heavenly funicular," anchored by a satellite in an orbit so high that its velocity matched Earth's rotation, keeping it over the same place on Earth at all times. From this geostationary satellite, long cables would stretch to the ground so that payloads could be hauled into the cosmos.</p>
        <p>Similar ideas crop up in science fiction and the musings of Konstantin E. Tsiolkovsky, the 19th-century Russian dreamer of space travel. He suggested a sort of soaring Eiffel Tower that would reach the geostationary orbit of 22,300 miles. A far cry from the simple wire and satellite to be flown on Atlantis, perhaps, but a dream as old as the Biblical Tower of Babel, "whose top may reach into heaven."</p>
