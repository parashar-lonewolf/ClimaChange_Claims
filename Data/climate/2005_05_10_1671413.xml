        <p>Duke Energy, one of the nation's largest utilities, said yesterday that it had agreed to buy Cinergy in an all-stock deal valued at $9 billion to expand its businesses in power and gas into the Midwest.</p>
        <p>The acquisition would create a company with 5.4 million customers, 54,000 megawatts of electricity generation and operations in two-thirds of the United States, as well as Canada and most of South America.</p>
        <p>The deal adds momentum to the industry's consolidation at a time of rising costs for supplies like natural gas. The energy industry came under scrutiny after the fall of Enron four years ago. After several quarters of streamlining their businesses in response, utility companies are now trying to grow through acquisition.</p>
        <p>Last December, for instance, the Exelon Corporation agreed to buy the Public Service Enterprise Group, the parent of New Jersey's largest utility, P.S.E.G., for about $13 billion to create a power giant in the Northeast. Duke and Exelon would be about equal in size.</p>
        <p>''You're going to grow in this business by virtue of saving money rather than growth,'' said James R. Halloran, an equity research analyst at National City Private Client Group, a money management firm that owns two million Duke shares and 55,000 shares of Cinergy. ''And if you have to buy it rather than build it, that's what you do.''</p>
        <p>The purchase of Cinergy would enable Duke, based in Charlotte, N.C., to extend its reach into Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky. The companies had $27 billion in combined revenue and $1.9 billion in net income last year, with assets totaling $70 billion.</p>
        <p>The deal is expected to revive the fortunes of Duke Energy North America, the company's unprofitable merchant power business. In the first quarter, the unit had an operating loss of $35 million.</p>
        <p>''This improves the weakest aspect in our portfolio, the Midwest,'' Paul M. Anderson, chairman of Duke, said during an analyst meeting that was broadcast via a conference call. ''Duke's gas position in the Northwest complements Cinergy's coal positions in that region.''</p>
        <p>Among the main benefits of the transaction are cost savings that are expected to reach $400 million a year, according to executives from both companies who were meeting with analysts in New York yesterday.</p>
        <p>Another is to help Duke offset its reliance on gas-powered electrical plants with cheaper-to-operate coal-fired assets owned by Cinergy. At the most efficient gas-fueled plants, producing electricity costs $48.43 a megawatt-hour, compared with $19.07 from coal, Bloomberg News said, citing figures by Energy Velocity in 2003, the last year for which such statistics were available.</p>
        <p>Duke adds 1.5 million of Cinergy's electric customers to its own 2.2 million and 500,000 of Cinergy's gas customers to its 1.2 million. It also more than doubles the territory it services, to 47,000 square miles.</p>
        <p>''The company achieves much more scale, geographic diversity and fuel diversity,'' analysts at Merrill Lynch wrote in a note to investors. They noted that Cinergy's electricity generation was mainly fueled by coal while Duke used mainly gas.</p>
        <p>Duke said it would offer 1.56 of its shares for each share of Cinergy, valuing the transaction at $45.80 a share, or 13 percent more than Cinergy's closing price on Friday. Shareholders of Cinergy will own about 24 percent of Duke after the deal is completed.</p>
        <p>Shares of Cinergy, which is based in Cincinnati, rose $1.94, to $42.32. They have gained 18 percent in the last year. Shares of Duke fell 54 cents, to $28.82. They have gained 48 percent in the last 12 months, outperforming the 8 percent gain of Standard &amp; Poor's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Anderson, chairman and chief executive of Duke, will become chairman of the board, and James E. Rogers, chairman and chief executive of Cinergy, will become president and chief executive.</p>
        <p>''Jim Rogers has been one of the most vocal executives that the industry must be more proactive, that environmental laws will get tougher, and that the industry should lead the parade in antipollution norms,'' said Charles Fishman, an analyst at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons in St. Louis. ''He probably didn't make a lot of friends and he now has a bigger base to talk from. You might find him visiting Washington more to set energy policy.''</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Anderson said Duke would speak up about issues like taxes on carbon emissions as well as climate change. ''If we don't speak, regulators will make rules and we will have to live with them,'' he said. ''It's better to be part of the process. A carbon tax, for example, makes a lot of sense. It's a no-regrets approach to global warming.''</p>
        <p>To help reduce costs, Duke and Cinergy expect to cut about 1,500 employees, or 5 percent of their combined staff of 29,350. The cuts will be ''primarily through attrition, early retirements and other severance programs,'' the statement said.</p>
        <p>Duke also said it would increase its dividend by 12.7 percent, or 14 cents, to $1.24, effective in September.</p>
        <p>The acquisition was endorsed by the boards of both companies.</p>
        <p>It is still subject to approval by the shareholders of both companies as well as state and federal regulators in North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana; the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; the Nuclear Regulatory Commission; the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department.</p>
        <p>The deal is expected to close in July 2006.</p>
        <p>Duke was advised by UBS Investment Bank and Lazard and Cinergy was advised by Merrill Lynch. The firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom was Duke's legal adviser and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz advised Cinergy.</p>
