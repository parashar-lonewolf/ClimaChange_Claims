        <p>TOM'S RESTAURANT at 112th Street and Broadway in Upper  Manhattan is right out of ''Seinfeld.'' But six floors above, Dr. Makiko Sato and Dr. James E. Hansen are conjuring up a bigger world from the innards of what looks like a slightly oversized personal computer. This is no ordinary computer, however. It contains the earth's atmosphere and oceans, albeit in mathematical form, interconnected to create a virtual global climate system.</p>
        <p>About 20 of these ocean-atmosphere climate models now exist, four times as many as a decade ago. They are the principal tools available to researchers who are trying to understand how the global climate is changing. By pumping data on temperature, winds, solar radiation, ocean currents and a host of other climatic factors into a model and then setting it in motion, scientists can simulate what could happen over time if emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases increase.</p>
        <p>These simulations are the basis of predictions that the average surface temperature of the earth will rise substantially and disrupt the world's climate in coming decades unless there are reductions in the emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which is produced by the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil.</p>
        <p>The models' forecast -- a unanimous one -- has been accepted uncritically as gospel by some environmentalists and even some scientists and dismissed as all but worthless by some opponents of emissions reductions. Most experts take a middle stance, saying that while the models are getting more realistic all the time, they remain relatively crude versions of reality whose findings should be interpreted with care.</p>
        <p>So how useful are the models as policy guides for the nations of the world as they prepare to meet in Kyoto, Japan, on Dec. 1 to negotiate cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases?</p>
        <p>One hint materializes from the computer above Tom's, one of several like it in the offices of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. Dr. Sato, a physicist and climate researcher, punches keys, and world maps appear on her computer's monitor. In vivid colors ranging from yellow to orange to dark red (for degrees of warmth) through shades of blue (for degrees of cold), maps on the right of the screen show the pattern of global temperature changes the computer climate model ''predicted'' for the period 1979 to 1995. Maps on the left show the changes that actually took place.</p>
        <p>The picture presented by the comparison is clear: In broadest terms, the computer got it right; the world as a whole warmed, and the Northern Hemisphere warmed most. But it also got a lot of the regional details wrong. The computer said that eastern Canada should have warmed substantially, for instance, but, instead, it cooled a lot.</p>
        <p>Not a lot of stock should be placed in a single ''run'' of a single model, or even in many runs. But many runs of many models present the same picture suggested by the maps on Dr. Sato's screen: that the models show a general global fidelity to reality but also pervasive regional error. They also continue to yield the same general conclusion their much cruder predecessors first yielded nearly two decades ago: that a doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere would raise the earth's average surface temperature by three to eight degrees Fahrenheit.  The wide range is a measure of the differences among model projections, and thus of the uncertainty inherent in climate modeling.</p>
        <p>A doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations is expected late in the next century if the world pursues business as usual. To get an idea of the magnitude of the models' forecast, one should consider that the world is five to nine degrees warmer now than in the depths of the last ice age.</p>
        <p>Despite the models' inability to simulate the regional details of climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of scientists advising the climate negotiations under United Nations auspices, says its confidence in the models is growing. Not only have the models become more sophisticated and detailed, the scientists say, they have also successfully passed some important reality checks by simulating actual climate changes with reasonable accuracy.</p>
        <p>The models are exhibiting ''a progressive convergence toward what has happened in nature,'' said Dr. W. Lawrence Gates, a climatologist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California who has long been a leader of systematic international efforts, including those of the intergovernmental panel, to evaluate the models.</p>
        <p>For making long-term predictions of climatic change on a continental scale or greater, Dr. Gates said, ''the ensemble of existing modern models is reliable'' and ''provides a firm scientific base for policy.''</p>
        <p>Not everyone agrees. Some skeptics, like Dr. Richard S. Lindzen of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have always considered the models worthless as prognosticators, and still do. ''I'm not saying the model output bears no resemblance at all to nature; in the gross figures, it looks plausibly similar,'' Dr. Lindzen said. But that, he said, ''does not give you forecast ability.''</p>
        <p>No model, by definition, will ever match the real world perfectly. ''It's never going to happen,'' said Dr. Hansen, the director of the Goddard Institute. A decade ago, Dr. Hansen became the first scientist to go on record before Congress and say that the greenhouse effect was probably the cause of global warming.</p>
        <p>Models will always fail to mimic nature exactly, he says, even though today's smaller but much faster computers make possible a precision unapproached by the lumbering mainframe that occupied an entire floor above Tom's some 20 years ago, when the Hansen team became one of the first to simulate global climate -- and even though still faster computers are just over the horizon.</p>
        <p>For one thing, the atmosphere's normal internal churnings are to some extent unpredictable; some variations are never repeated exactly. As Dr. Hansen put it, ''the climate in any year is like a snowflake; no two are alike.'' The same can be said for decades and centuries. For another thing, the atmosphere is far too complex to be completely captured in any computer program. The essence of modeling is to simplify but to retain the processes most important in driving the climate.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, proponents of the models say, they are the most powerful tools available for analyzing climate. While the incessant pouring of greenhouse gases into the air by industrial activity constitutes an experiment of sorts, there is no way to know how it will turn out without waiting for several decades. Why turn to computers? The atmosphere is simply too complex for any other mode of analysis, and the virtual climate made possible by computers is far closer to reality than any model that might be generated in anyone's head, the model proponents say.</p>
        <p>Some things about climate are simple and certain enough, needing no computer analysis. Scientists know, for instance, that a doubling of carbon dioxide, by itself, would warm the earth's surface by about two degrees. They also know that atmospheric concentrations of the gas are increasing as a result of industrial activity.</p>
        <p>But simplicity ends there. The warming touches off feedback processes, some of which increase the warming and some of which decrease it. For instance, a warmer atmosphere melts snow and sea ice, both of which cool the planet by reflecting sunlight; less ice and snow  means further warming. On the other hand, warming also increases low-level clouds, which cool the planet.</p>
        <p>Modeling is in large measure an exercise in representing enough of these competing influences faithfully enough to estimate their net effect.  The most important of the feedback influences, perhaps, involves water vapor, the most powerful greenhouse gas of all. An atmosphere warmed by carbon dioxide produces more vapor, and this amplification is critical to the models' forecasts of future warming.</p>
        <p>A climate model is a computer program containing mathematical equations that express fundamental laws of atmospheric physics. These laws govern the interlinked workings of the sun, atmosphere, oceans, land and other elements of the climate system. The various feedback influences are also expressed mathematically. The computer calculates the extent to which the basic physical laws dictate changes in things like temperature and precipitation over time and under different conditions.  For instance, modelers can introduce any sort of ''forcing'' influence they want -- increasing greenhouse gases, for instance -- to see what would happen over decades and centuries.</p>
        <p>One big limitation of the models in predicting the climate decades ahead is that despite the growing speed of computers, they are unable to calculate climatic changes everywhere in the atmosphere. Instead, they make the calculations only at widely separated points. The points form a three-dimensional grid typically rising 10 or 12 miles above the earth. A typical spacing between grid points is about 150 miles horizontally and less than half a mile vertically. This ''resolution,'' as scientists call it, is about twice as fine as a decade ago. But it still misses many processes that happen between grid points -- cloud formation, for example. So modelers approximate these factors as best they can.</p>
        <p>Coarse resolution is also the major reason why the models are not very good at simulating climate at the regional scale. They simply miss too many small-scale climatic influences, like topography, vegetation and regional atmospheric churnings.  Some modelers have developed techniques for overcoming this. For instance, they might model only part of the ocean-atmosphere system, using much more closely spaced grid points, to get a better fix on regional changes. That approach has been successfully employed, for instance, in predicting the comings and goings of El Nino, the vast pool of tropical Pacific water that disrupts weather around the world.</p>
        <p>In another technique, modelers take the general results of a global climate model and use them to construct a second model of higher resolution for a limited region. Researchers at Pennsylvania State University have so far successfully used this ''nesting'' technique to reproduce observed precipitation patterns in the Middle Atlantic region.</p>
        <p>As computers become more advanced, the resolution of models continues to improve. Researchers at a number of Federal laboratories are collaborating in the development of a next-generation model using several computers operating in parallel. The ocean part of the model has a horizontal grid spacing of less than 20 miles, which researchers believe is necessary to represent fine-scale ocean eddies and currents.</p>
        <p>It is only in the last few years that models have included deep-ocean processes, which are critical to the climate system's functioning. The ocean, for instance, absorbs both carbon dioxide and heat, transports heat from one part of the planet to the other and provides moisture to the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>An even bigger limitation of the models than coarse resolution is the incomplete knowledge of the atmosphere's functioning, Dr. Hansen says. Dr. Gates agrees, saying, ''How the natural world works -- that's always going to be our problem.''</p>
        <p>Still, the models have been steadily incorporating more and more features of the climate system. One of the most important, in terms of model realism, has been the effect of tiny solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the atmosphere. The modern economy produces a lot of these aerosols, as they are called, most notably sulfur dioxide droplets emitted by industry. Aerosols cool parts of the planet by reflecting sunlight. Before this effect was included in the models, they consistently produced more global warming than was being observed. Afterward, the model representations and the observations agreed more closely.</p>
        <p>With the aerosol effect factored in, the intergovernmental science panel estimates that the average global temperature will rise by two to six degrees in the next century, with a best estimate of about three and a half degrees, barring cuts in greenhouse emissions. The warming will continue after that, the panel says.</p>
        <p>The biggest gap in knowledge, many scientists believe, is that the net effect of clouds on the planet's temperature is still unknown. While low-level clouds reflect heat, high-level clouds trap it. Moreover, experts do not fully understand how water vapor behaves when the atmosphere warms. The amount by which vapor amplifies the warming therefore remains uncertain.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lindzen has long maintained that the models simply get the physics of the water vapor feedback wrong, at least at high altitudes. The United Nations panel says the amplification clearly takes place at lower altitudes but concedes the uncertainty about higher altitudes.</p>
        <p>Even if such uncertainties are somehow resolved, modelers will  never be sure that they have included all the information necessary for realism. ''With any models, what you never know is what you haven't put in,'' said Dr. Jeremiah P. Ostriker of Princeton University, who comes at computer modeling from a different perspective, that of an astrophysicist who uses models to study the cosmos. The best reality check, he said, ''is to see how well you can match the real world.''</p>
        <p>By that standard, on the plus side, mainstream scientists say the models reproduce the main features of present-day climate, including the seasonal cycle, the comings and goings of monsoons, the seasonal shift of major rain belts and storm tracks, the average daily temperature cycle and many large-scale features of ocean circulation.</p>
        <p>In the last two years, Dr. Gates said, models have for the first time reproduced the magnitude and frequency of the climate system's natural internal fluctuations on several time scales. ''A number of them now have simulated variability that looks realistic,'' he said. But, he said, the unpredictability inherent in these fluctuations makes it impossible to predict their timing, and always will.</p>
        <p>The models have also reproduced, at least in general outline, the changes in global climate observed in the last century. These include not only a general global warming of about one degree but also broad patterns of temperature change, both geographically and vertically,  through the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>When the Mount Pinatubo volcano erupted in the Philippines in 1991, sending aloft a global haze of planet-cooling aerosols, the Goddard model predicted that the cooling would be about one degree at its low point and would last about two years. That is what actually happened. To many experts, that indicates that the model faithfully reflects the climate system's sensitivity to heating and cooling influences from outside -- whether they be aerosols or greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>Models have also simulated the climate of the last ice age and come up with an average global temperature about seven degrees lower than today's, well within the cold period's actual temperature range.</p>
        <p>But the models do not always match reality this well. One major shortcoming, for instance, is that the global models fail to simulate accurately the major temperature swings associated with El Nino. And there is that biggest deficiency of all:  the failure to predict climatic change accurately on a regional scale.</p>
        <p>In sum, the models are still cloudy crystal balls. But they are getting clearer, and they offer some answers.</p>
        <p>''Despite all the uncertainties, I think you can make useful estimates'' of climatic change using the models, said Dr. Andrew P. Ingersoll, a planetary scientist at the California Institute of Technology who employs them to investigate the climates of other planets.</p>
        <p>''You just have to be aware of the uncertainties,'' he said. ''It's just like any other scientific process.''</p>
