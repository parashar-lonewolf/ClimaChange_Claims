        <p>LEAD: SCHOOLCHILDREN, communities and garden clubs have been celebrating Arbor Day since last week. The day itself is set by each municipality, with local officials choosing a day when the climate suits tree planting. The founder of Arbor Day, J. Sterling Morton, selected April 27 a century ago as the day for celebration.</p>
        <p>SCHOOLCHILDREN, communities and garden clubs have been celebrating Arbor Day since last week. The day itself is set by each municipality, with local officials choosing a day when the climate suits tree planting. The founder of Arbor Day, J. Sterling Morton, selected April 27 a century ago as the day for celebration.</p>
        <p>One hopes that after the tree-planting ceremony is over, the trees will survive and grow to be providers of shade for the community. Usually the trees do survive, but when they do not, faulty planting can often be blamed. The saying used to be, ''dig a $5 hole for a 50-cent tree.'' A big hole was dug to provide ample root room, and the tree was set in place. The soil was packed down tightly, usually with the feet, and then the tree was watered in. Tree roots grew outward into the big soil ball.</p>
        <p>But researchers have found that planters of trees must change their ways. They have learned that once roots grow out from the improved soil in the planting hole to the original soil mass, they encircle the planting hole and grow round and round, much the same way as the root system grows for a potted plant. With a house plant, repotting to a pot one size larger is the solution. But a tree cannot be so easily replanted.</p>
        <p>Old ways die hard, and this technique for tree planting will take some time for every one to get used to.</p>
        <p>The new planting method is supported by many professionals and was developed in response to a survey conducted last year by the American Forestry Association. It was put forth recently by Gary Moll, who is vice president of the organization's urban forestry program.</p>
        <p>The new specifications instruct planters to prepare a shallow planting area, about 12 inches deep, but five times the diameter of the root ball, so the roots can spread farther into the soil.</p>
        <p>The tree needs enough room for its roots and branches to extend to full size. Trees are more shallow rooted than most people think.</p>
        <p>A planting hole is dug in the middle of the area to acccommodate the root ball, so the tree is placed at the same level at which it was growing. This root spread will provide a stronger base for the young tree, especially when there are high winds or little rainfall.</p>
        <p>Instead of tramping the soil by foot the professionals now recommend that adequate watering be used to remove the air pockets.</p>
        <p>Soak the planting hole well. One of the best ways for home gardeners to do this is to turn on the hose and allow a slow trickle to seep into the ground and root zone. Watch carefully to be sure the water seeps away; if there are puddles left, then there is a soil drainage problem, and the tree's survival may be in jeopardy. The planting hole should be backfilled with the remaining soil, but the water will do the rest as it seeps in and removes the air pockets without compacting the soil around the root areas.</p>
        <p>And, of course, it is essential to remove any plastic wrap around the tree's root ball before planting. The plastic will not biodegrade, and it should be removed entirely, so it does not lie at the base of the planting hole or block water intake. Sometimes plastic is used as a sled to pull the heavy root ball to the site, but never leave it under the tree.</p>
        <p>After all the planting, the new tree should be staked and guywired, so it does not swing and sway in high winds. The stakes can be removed in a year or so, when the tree has anchored itself securely in the ground.</p>
        <p>A National Global Releaf Program is well under way and sponsored by the American Forestry Association. The program has been organized because the organizations believe that individuals can make a difference. The Davey Tree Expert Company has joined the effort, and the goal is to plant 100 million trees in cities and towns by 1992. The descriptive brochure for the program says, ''Though Americans make up less than 5 percent of the world's population, we burn almost 25 percent of the world's fossil fuels, a major source of carbon dioxide.''</p>
        <p>If gardeners think of trees only as pretty assets to the community, they can think again. Granted, trees are delightful to have around the garden, especially at this time of year when the magnolias, cherries, dogwoods and apple blossoms start to appear.</p>
        <p>But Nina Bassuk, who is with the department of floriculture and ornamental horticulture at Cornell University, has done some serious calculating about the value of trees and here are some of her findings:</p>
        <p>''One tree can assimilate about 13 pounds of carbon dioxide each year, or enough to offset the pollution produced by driving one car for 26,000 miles.</p>
        <p>''Planting trees is more cost effective than trying to reduce car emissions. It costs 1 cent to eliminate a pound of carbon dioxide by planting a tree; it costs 10 cents to elmiminate a pound of carbon dioxide by reducing auto emissions.''  GARDENING</p>
