        <p>IF you want something done right, Marilyn and Jerry Wilson say you have to do it yourself.

        <p>IF you want something done right, Marilyn and Jerry Wilson say you have to do it yourself. They want their local nuclear plant closed as soon as possible, so they established the Do-It-Yourself Committee. The committee is backing a proposition on the Oregon ballot this November to close the Trojan reactor within 30 days after the election.</p>
        <p>A former jet charter pilot, Mr. Wilson is the founder of Soloflex. The company name prompted one nuclear industry official in Washington to accuse him of ulterior motives in fighting the plant. After all, Soloflex, the official said, obviously stood to gain if a big market developed for solar power.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilson chalks this up to Easterners who stick extra r's in their words. Soloflex is an all-in-one exercise machine, a low-priced competitor to Universal. He added, though, that he does favor renewable energy sources like solar power.</p>
        <p>The Wilsons have spent well over $1 million so far and may reach $2 million in their drive to shut the plant, about 35 miles from Portland.</p>
        <p>What makes their effort even more noteworthy is that when they began, they were the second group in the field. An earlier coalition against the plant, which lost in two previous referendums, is trying again. And the Wilsons are charging ahead despite an announcement recently by the plant's owner, Portland General Electric, that it plans to retire Trojan in four years, 20 years ahead of the original date.</p>
        <p>If the plant runs four years under a "death sentence," Mr. Wilson said, the best workers will leave and the reactor will be operated by the people who cannot find work elsewhere.</p>
        <p>What lures a captain of industry into this battle? "I'm at most a lieutenant of industry, not even a captain," said Mr. Wilson, who is 48 years old. His company had sales of about $50 million last year, down from a peak of $98 million two years ago, and has sold half a million units since it opened in 1978.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilson said he and his wife saw something wrong and thought their years of selling a consumer product had given them the skills to right it.  Soloflex's widespread television and print advertising, which makes good use of men and women with perfectly sculpted bodies, has prompted eight million people to call the company's toll-free number to request a brochure, he said.</p>
        <p>Much of the response came from broadcasing on cable TV channels beginning in 1986, "when Congress 'decriminalized' program-length commercials."</p>
        <p>As for the decision to fight the Trojan plant, "it goes back to Confucius," said Mr. Wilson. "When you see something wrong and refuse to do anything about it, it's for lack of courage, and we didn't want to think that about ourselves."</p>
        <p>If both referendums pass in November, the Do-It-Yourself plan would take precedence. It orders that the cost of decommissioning be borne by utility shareholders. That clause is certain to face legal challenge.</p>
