        <p>ROGUE NATION  American Unilateralism and the Failure of Good Intentions  By Clyde Prestowitz  328 pages. Basic Books. $26.</p>
        <p>Nothing is harder for Americans to understand than the extraordinary complex of responses that the United States evokes today throughout the rest of the world: incomprehension, resentment, admiration, fear, envy and, as one might say, shock and awe. The incomprehension is mutual. Few nations have ever needed more ''to see ourselves as others see us,'' in the phrase, than Americans today.</p>
        <p>At this astonishing juncture in history, when the United States has demonstrated overwhelming military might and the ability to act as it pleases, Clyde Prestowitz steps back to try to view his country in perspective. Now president of the Economic Strategy Institute, a research group in Washington, he has had a long and varied career, partly spent outside America, which gives him an advantage most of his compatriots lack. His theme in ''Rogue Nation'' is American unilateralism, not only in the mainstream of foreign policy but also in various tributuaries. Mr. Prestowitz recites a familar and gloomy litany -- small-arms control, global warming and Kyoto, the International Criminal Court and plenty of other areas where Washington has thwarted international consensus.</p>
        <p>There is nothing new about national egoism, after all; great powers have always pursued their own interests. Yet even when they didn't do so in a decorous way, or with what high-minded earlier Americans called a decent respect for the opinions of mankind, older powers necessarily had some regard for the views and interests of other countries. Even at the apogee of British might 100 years ago, when their neighbors often saw the English as perfidious and hypocritical, Britain pretended to pay some attention to those neighbors and tried to retain some of their good will.</p>
        <p>The United States, under the Bush administration, Mr. Prestowitz suggests, is quite different, with a disrespect for the opinion of mankind that verges on the indecent. If its attitude toward its foes is Accius' ''Oderint dum metuant'' -- ''Let them hate us so long as they fear us'' -- the administration's attitude toward its friends is borrowed from the 19th-century statesman Prince Schwarzenberg: They will be astonished by the magnitude of our ingratitude.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Prestowitz perceives, the real trouble with current American policy is not so much that it is unilateral and highhanded as that it doesn't even understand the cynical, older notion of enlightened self-interest. Washington acts on the principle that ''they need us more than we need them,'' a belief that has been encouraged by some of the more simple-minded exponents of globalization as the latest version of the American way. Quite apart from being a little ill mannered, this isn't even true.</p>
        <p>That applies in the Middle East, above all in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Although it's often said that only the United States can untie that knot, one could also put it the other way around: unilateral and unaided American power cannot effect a political solution in the Holy Land in the same way that it can achieve an effortless military victory in Mesopotamia.</p>
        <p>At the same time, nearly the most significant thing about the Israeli-Palestinian issue is the wedge it is driving between the United States and Europe. Once again there is a great gulf of perception, not least because of the way this story is covered in the news media. If you knew about it only from television in the United States and in Europe, Mr. Prestowitz observes, it might be two completely different stories.</p>
        <p>For numerous Americans, Indonesia, Taiwan and Latin America -- all of which Mr. Prestowitz touches on -- are little more than names, though also markets and sources of cheap labor. Mr. Prestowitz is depressed, as he might be, by the ignorance of the outside world found among his countrymen, some of whom seem to echo the English insularity parodied by Nancy Mitford: ''Abroad is unutterably bloody and foreigners are fiends.''</p>
        <p>In reality, as Mr. Prestowitz recognizes, relations between the United States and Europe are now crucially important. Even if Europe doesn't exist as a military factor, it is a fully fledged superpower in global economics. When Europe acts as one body and speaks with one voice -- as it increasingly does in economic matters -- the United States needs to recognize it as an equal, which can't be given orders. The European Union's gross domestic product will soon be more than $9 trillion, twice Japan's. Although the United States is at present still ahead with $10 trillion, it would only take a shift in exchange rates to reverse that.</p>
        <p>It is at least possible that the real threat to American dominance may come not from violent Islamism or from the ''Japanese challenge'' (the subject of Mr. Prestowitz's last book, ''Trading Places''), but from an old Europe that has its own economic weapons to hand. No more than a European demand for oil sales to be billed in euros rather than dollars would be needed to put serious pressure on the American currency.</p>
        <p>Writing in a virtuous strain just this side of self-righteousness (itself a venerable American tradition), Mr. Prestowitz says that ''we need to rethink American exceptionalism,'' recognizing that other people's problems ''are our problems too and that we don't have all the answers.'' This is not a popular message in Washington today, but that's where it needs to be heard.</p>
