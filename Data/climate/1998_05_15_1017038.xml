        <p>Beyond Tepees And Peace Pipes</p>
        <p>If your children's only experiences of American Indian culture come from Disney's ''Pocahontas'' and recycled Warner Brothers cartoons, this weekend will offer opportunities to observe and share the real heritage of a variety of tribes. The National Museum of the American Indian's first annual Children's Festival will present performances, workshops, storytelling, film, video and exhibits designed to let youngsters not only follow, but also dance, in the footsteps of ancient peoples.</p>
        <p>Workshops, for example, will teach Indian social dances. ''In the Rabbit Dance, you hop around like rabbits,'' said Russ Tall Chief, a spokesman for the museum. ''And in the Snake Dance, you follow the leader and slink around, so you actually form a snake. These help dispel the misconception that all our dances are about ceremonies and war.''</p>

        <p>Beyond Tepees And Peace Pipes</p>
        <p>If your children's only experiences of American Indian culture come from Disney's ''Pocahontas'' and recycled Warner Brothers cartoons, this weekend will offer opportunities to observe and share the real heritage of a variety of tribes. The National Museum of the American Indian's first annual Children's Festival will present performances, workshops, storytelling, film, video and exhibits designed to let youngsters not only follow, but also dance, in the footsteps of ancient peoples.</p>
        <p>Workshops, for example, will teach Indian social dances. ''In the Rabbit Dance, you hop around like rabbits,'' said Russ Tall Chief, a spokesman for the museum. ''And in the Snake Dance, you follow the leader and slink around, so you actually form a snake. These help dispel the misconception that all our dances are about ceremonies and war.''</p>
        <p>Mary Jane Bird, of the Pueblo nation, will lead another workshop combining Indian dance with modern dance and ballet. And for those who would rather watch than wing it, the Absalooka National Children's Dance Group, made up of Crow children ages 6 to 16, will perform twice each day. (But don't expect to remain seated for the entire show.)</p>
        <p>The sports-minded can jump into the Indian and Eskimo Olympics, which will introduce events like arm pulls and leg wrestling. ''They have been toned down, so there's no risk of injury,'' Mr. Tall Chief said.</p>
        <p>Hands will be busy, too, at workshops teaching how to make friendship bracelets, clay pots, cornhusk dolls, beadwork and other crafts.</p>
        <p>And since children love to see how other young people lived, the museum's other attractions will include archival photographs of Indian children, dating from 1830 to about 1940.</p>
        <p>Children's Festival, tomorrow and Sunday, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. at the George Gustav Heye Center, National Museum of the American Indian, Smithsonian Institution, One Bowling Green, lower Manhattan, (212) 514-3705. Free.</p>
        <p>That Old-Time Ecology</p>
        <p>A house of worship seems like an appropriate place to sing about salvation. But the people preaching on Sunday afternoon at St. Bartholomew's Church won't be clergy, but actors and children. And their concern will not be saving souls -- well, not directly -- but the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>The occasion is a concert performance of ''Ozone-a-Thon,'' a musical by Michael Ogborn in which characters like Mother Earth, Mr. Trash, the Choral Riffs and Spotted Owl tackle a subject that, in Mr. Ogborn's view, is often presented too grimly.</p>
        <p>''The planet has been here millions of years,'' he said, ''and while we've affected it greatly, we can also change it for the better.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ogborn and Mike Weilbacher, who wrote the musical's book, devised a plot in which four children conceive their own variety show and telethon, or ozone-a-thon.</p>
        <p>An actor playing an M.C. ''will go out into the audience and take their pledges,'' Mr. Ogborn said, ''not of money, but of things they can do to keep the Earth a cool place to live.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ogborn will also have the audience perform one of the songs, ''Now, Because I Care,'' which will be introduced by St. Bartholomew's choir.</p>
        <p>Of course, you can only wonder what St. Bartholomew himself would have thought about another number, ''Tappin' the Resources,'' being danced on a platform over the altar steps. Then again, saving the world was his priority, too.</p>
        <p>''Ozone-a-Thon,'' Sunday at 2 P.M. at St. Bartholomew's Church, Park Avenue and 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 378-0248. Tickets: $25 for one adult and one child; $50 a family.</p>
        <p>Off to Join the Circus</p>
        <p>For most children, the only thing better than seeing a circus is being in one. This weekend in Prospect Park, Brooklyn, they will be able to do both as the members of the Russian American Kids Circus juggle, clown, spin plates, ride unicycles and teach their eager fans to do much of the same.</p>
        <p>Founded by Alex Berenchtein, a former member of the Moscow Circus, the Kids Circus is made up of children ages 3 to 17 who have studied in his after-school program at the New Way Circus Center in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>''We have a circus that is by kids and for kids,'' said Regina Berenchtein, the circus's managing director and Mr. Berenchtein's wife. ''We prove that every child is talented -- when they come to us, they don't know anything about circus arts.''</p>
        <p>The circus will put on shows tomorrow and Sunday at 11 A.M., 1 P.M. and 3 P.M., with teaching workshops in between. Although the troupe's finale is usually eight children doing acrobatics on a bicycle, the lessons will be more elementary.</p>
        <p>Part of the annual ''You Gotta Have Park'' festival, Circus Days will also include performances by Nicholas Souren, who does an aerial ladder act; Mike Straka, a magician, and the Crowtations, a group of blues-singing crow puppets.</p>
        <p>Hansel and Gretel will visit the park as well. Tomorrow puppeteers from the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theater will enact the story of the pair who foolishly marked their path home from the forest with crumbs. (They should have watched out for hungry Crowtations.)</p>
        <p>Circus Days, tomorrow on the lawn near the Prospect Park carousel, by the Flatbush Avenue/Empire Boulevard entrance; Sunday on the Long Meadow near the Tennis House (enter at Ninth Street and Prospect Park West). Free. ''Hansel and Gretel,'' tomorrow at 2 and 4 P.M. at the Imagination Playground, near the Lincoln Road/Ocean Avenue entrance. Free with $1 donation. Information on all events: (718) 965-8999.</p>
