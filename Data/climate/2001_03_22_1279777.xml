        <p>Imperial County, located on the border with Mexico, has plenty of problems, but energy is not one of them.</p>
        <p>''We didn't think we had an energy problem,'' said Ann Capella, the chief executive of the county, which has its power supplied by the vast Imperial Irrigation District. ''We have plenty of water and plenty of power.''</p>
        <p>All that changed this week. But instead of confronting rolling blackouts like those imposed elsewhere in California, the county is facing financial troubles arising from the energy crisis. The CalEnergy Operating Corporation, a renewable energy provider with geothermal plants in the county and its largest taxpayer, said it would not be able to make a $3.9 million property tax payment due April 10 because it had not been paid by Southern California Edison for five months.</p>
        <p>''It certainly could become a major crisis for us,'' Ms. Capella said.</p>
        <p>With 10 geothermal plants creating energy by extracting superheated water near the Salton Sea, CalEnergy has helped change the fabric of the county, one of the state's poorest. With only 140,000 residents and little industry, the county has come to rely in the $10 million a year in property taxes paid by the company, which employs about 200 people. CalEnergy, a subsidiary of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company, is the largest of three renewable energy producers in the county. Together, the three account for 14 percent of the $67 million in property taxes collected in Imperial County.</p>
        <p>School officials estimate that 50 percent of their general budget comes from taxes paid by CalEnergy, and Superintendent James C. Hanks said the crisis had forced the district to put on hold a bond sale for necessary for improvements.</p>
        <p>In a meeting today with CalEnergy's chairman, David L. Sokol, Mr. Hanks said his immediate concern was for students whose parents worked at the plant.</p>
        <p>As fallout from deregulation and the financial troubles of Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison continue to grow, the impact on California counties that are home to small renewable energy companies, which provide about 12 percent of the state's power, is just beginning to be felt. Renewable energy companies in eight other counties say they may soon be in the same position as CalEnergy if they are not paid soon.</p>
        <p>Unlike their larger peers, these smaller companies are not guaranteed payment by the State Department of Water Resources, which agreed earlier this year to buy electricity on behalf of the nearly bankrupt utilities. Instead, these companies have contracts to sell power directly to the utilities.</p>
        <p>The problems confronting small alternative generators in California, which include renewable energy companies -- which rely on wind, waste and geothermal water resources -- and co-generators that make electricity as a byproduct, came to the forefront this week as rolling blackouts were instituted on Monday and Tuesday when the state could not meet electricity demands. Among several factors contributing to the problem was that some independents had gone off line because they had not been paid by Southern California Edison and PG&amp;E. Lower temperatures and the completion of repairs at some power plants helped the state avoid blackouts today.</p>
        <p>Gov. Gray Davis announced on Tuesday that he would ask the State Public Utilities Commission to order Southern California Edison and PG&amp;E to begin paying for their power from the independent operators as of April 1. Past payments were not addressed. Enabling legislation would be required to support this.</p>
        <p>''We're encouraged but we've heard it before,'' Mr. Sokol said. ''We're very skeptical.''</p>
        <p>After five months of not being paid by Southern California Edison, Mr. Sokol said: ''Time has run out. The system is freezing up.''</p>
        <p>He was in Imperial County to meet with employees, mineral rights holders and public officials, before a Superior Court hearing on Thursday in which CalEnergy will ask to be allowed to suspend sales to Southern California Edison, which the company says owes it $140 million, and sell to paying buyers.</p>
        <p>If the company fails in court, he said, he expected renewable energy providers to try within a week to force Southern California Edison into involuntary bankruptcy.</p>
        <p>''We are drawing a line in the sand,'' Mr. Sokol said.</p>
        <p>Southern California Edison has opposed legislation that would establish a system for paying the independent energy providers, saying it is inconsistent and unworkable.</p>
        <p>Sitting in a meeting room in Brawley, Calif., waiting for Mr. Sokol to appear, landowners with mineral rights remained patient with CalEnergy while disdainful of the state's handling of the crisis.</p>
        <p>''If we ran a business like that, we'd be put in jail,'' said Kathryn Wood. ''It's just never ending.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  March 23, 2001, Friday  A picture caption yesterday with an article about the effects of the energy crisis on the economy of Imperial County, Calif., gave an erroneous name in some copies for a power company that has missed payments to suppliers. It is Southern California Edison, not Southern California Energy.</p>
