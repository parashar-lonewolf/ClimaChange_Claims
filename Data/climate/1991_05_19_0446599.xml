        <p>The complaints from American officials sound familiar: pollution from an outdated sewage system fouling international waters, and a surge of people crossing the border, some of them illegally, in search of economic oppportunity.</p>
        <p>Tijuana? El Paso? Try the 49th Parallel, where Washington State meets British Columbia. In a rare display of friction, United States officials are upset over what they call a "1950's-era" approach to pollution control in Canada, and for gridlock at a border entry area that is now the most heavily traveled on the nation's northern boundary.</p>
        <p>The pollution complaints arise because every day Victoria, the capital city of the fastest-growing province in Canada, dumps 20 million gallons of raw, untreated household sewage from the 250,000 people in its metropolitan area into waters shared by Canada and the United States. It is the only major city on this vast coastal region that does not treat its sewage.</p>
        <p>"It is astonishing that a city the size of Victoria is dumping so much raw sewage into the water," said Robert Burd, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency's regional director for water programs. "That is a lot of gross stuff being flushed out to sea. The problem is that Canada just doesn't have the environmental laws we have. They are about where the United States was in the 1950's."</p>
        <p>Mobs of Bargain Hunters</p>
        <p>The other major source of complaints is about Canadian bargain hunters who are overwhelming border communities in unprecedented numbers. Driven by high taxes and a cost of living that is nearly double that of Washington State, Canadians crossed the border into northwest Washington about 27 million times last year. The number of crossings, equal to Canada's entire population, was reported by five border stations within a 30-mile area.</p>
        <p>The visitors came to shop for things like gasoline, cheese, milk or even real estate. Unleaded gasoline, for example, sells for about $1.20 a gallon here, while it can cost more than $3 in United States money in British Columbia, where taxes and higher costs for processing run the price up.</p>
        <p>"We've not only lost control of our town, but the whole economy has shifted," said Bruce Brown, publisher of The Sumas Astonisher, the newspaper in another border town in northwest Washington. "Here's a little town of 749 people and you've got gridlock at 11 o'clock in the morning."</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown calculated that there is one gasoline dispenser for every three residents of the town.</p>
        <p>Moreover, prices are higher here than they are elsewhere in Washington because merchants know the Canadians will pay. This sends some local residents up to 70 miles south in search of basic goods.</p>
        <p>A recent study by the Chamber of Commerce in British Columbia estimated that the province was losing $1.2 billion (United States money) each year because of Canadians who were taking their business south.</p>
        <p>Opening of Commuter Lane</p>
        <p>To ease the border congestion, Canadian national officials have started a commuter lane for frequent international shoppers, but they say the only thing that will really reduce border crossings is a major shift in the Canadian economy.</p>
        <p>They say they are pressuring Victoria to clean up its municipal sewage system, but it could be years before Victoria builds plants to start treating its sewage.</p>
        <p>Victorians seem somewhat embarrassed by the sewage dispute, which has been the subject of many newspaper editorials on both sides of the border, and comments in British Columbia's Parliament and Washington's Legislature.</p>
        <p>The friction is a reversal of the early 1980's, when Canadians, primarily in the East, were complaining about pollution coming from the American side, in the form of acid rain. And Canadians in the Great Lakes region have long criticized water pollution originating in the United States.</p>
        <p>After spending billions of dollars to clean up sewage treatment plants in Washington State, officials on the United States side say the Canadians should do their share to remove effluents from the Strait of Juan de Fuca, which opens to the Pacific Ocean. They also complain about the flow of industrial chemicals from pulp and paper mills into the Fraser River, which empties into international waters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burd said past analysis of raw sewage indicates that toxic waste and chemicals are sent out to sea with the sewage. The sewage endangers a rich fishery that includes crab, halibut, salmon, cod, squid, oysters and clams, he said.</p>
        <p>Victoria officials say there is no proof that the sewage is harmful to marine life. "The sewage is 99 percent water, and the other 1 percent is made up of waste from us humans and chemicals that we throw away," said Michael Williams, the chief engineer of the agency that controls Victoria's sewage. "The concern that we have at the technnical level is chemicals. With respect to human waste, mother nature tends to take care of that."</p>
        <p>A longstanding agreement between the two countries says that if damage to fish can be proven, the polluting source can be forced to close. In recent meetings where United States officials raised the issue of Victoria's sewage, Canadian officials indicated willingness to cooperate, Mr. Burd said.</p>
        <p>An 'Unacceptable' Situation</p>
        <p>Canadian national officials have joined the criticism of Victoria. "We have told the City of Victoria that the present situation is unacceptable," said Alain David, a water pollution expert with Environment Canada, the federal pollution control agency.</p>
        <p>Last week, Victoria unveiled a study on how the city could clean up its sewage. The options could cost up to $350 million, the study said.</p>
        <p>While Victoria officials debate whether to spend the money to clean up their sewage, a solution for the other border is nowhere near a solution.</p>
        <p>Last year, according to evidence presented at a Congressional hearing on the problem, this border area became the most heavily used, passing the Buffalo and Detroit crossings. A recent Canadian tax of 7 percent on virtually all goods and services added to the incentive for Canadians to shop in the United States.</p>
        <p>Warehouses stocked with groceries and electronic goods draw near-capacity crowds every day. Many goods cost at least 50 percent less on the United States side of the border.</p>
        <p>Gasoline stations have sprouted in former dairy fields. Lines of returning Canadian cars stretch for miles on the United States side, waiting as long as three hours to re-enter their country. The delay is caused mostly by the collection of duties on goods purchased in this country.</p>
        <p>Traffic Chokes Town</p>
        <p>"They back up so far at the border station that it stretches three miles into town, blocks everything and our town comes to a stop," said Butch Hinchey, the Chief of Police here in Blaine, the American border town of 2,600 people that has become the main entry point. "We basically lose our town."</p>
        <p>To avoid the long waits at official border points, some Canadians have been crossing illegally, driving across thick wooden planks they place across an irrigation ditch that separates the two countries, customs officials say.</p>
        <p>While many businesses are prospering from the influx, some longtime residents do not like it. Chief Hinchey, a resident of Blaine for 22 years, said the only time he has seen border traffic this bad was in the 1970's, when a Canadian beer strike sent crowds south.</p>
        <p>In its experiment for the tourist season, the Canadians have started a commuter lane, open to people who cross the border frequently and have applied for a special decal.</p>
        <p>But only 20,000 applicants will be allowed to use the new system. Traffic jams will not go away, Mr. Watt said, until one country is less of a bargain than the other.</p>
