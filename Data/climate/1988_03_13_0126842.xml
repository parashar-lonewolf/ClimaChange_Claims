        <p>John Waters, Baltimore's new-est sage and the city's only full-time, live-in movie maker, loves Grace Metalious, fresh desk blotters, Glenn Gould, candy-filled bullets (''seven to a pack, 59 cents''), Pia Zadora, Flannery O'Connor and the films of Randall Kleiser (''Blue Lagoon,'' among others). He hates slobbering dogs met in elevators (''Every time you make direct eye contact with these creatures, your I.Q. drops 10 points''), Hermann Hesse, ''The African Queen,'' ''people who ostentatiously hold their ears in New York subways,'' and iceberg lettuce (''the polyester of greens'').</p>
        <p>In ''Crackpot,'' his collection of essays published by Macmillan two years ago, Mr. Waters says at one point that he has always wanted to sell out. ''The problem is that nobody wanted to buy me.''</p>
        <p>All that may change with the current box-office success of his new film, ''Hairspray,'' which would be too bad for those of us in the audience, as well as for any producer who did the buying. It's clear from both ''Hairspray'' and ''Crackpot'' that the compleat John Waters is a film maker and an essayist. You can't fully appreciate one without the other.</p>
        <p>The times get what they deserve, and John Waters is a movie maker and a satirist for ours, someone almost totally obsessed by fashions, fads, celebrity, interior decor and hypocrisy, as well as by the awful difficulties in going too far when the limits of acceptabilty keep being pushed back to neutralize all would-be offenders.</p>
        <p>However, it's significant that even Mr. Waters, who's made his reputation by dealing in bad taste, admits in ''Crackpot'' that ''you can always think of ways to offend (AIDS, sickle cell anemia and rape jokes) but this would hardly be daring, only stupid.'' He adds, ''Maybe the Golden Age of Trash is coming to an end.'' Never fear.  Had Mr. Waters been in the time and place of Jonathan Swift, would he have dared write ''A Modest Proposal,'' suggesting the eating of babies as a solution to the problems faced by the Irish economy? Probably not. Mr. Waters doesn't cut deep. He's a satirist of -and formed by - a culture that thinks it's waging a war on drugs by repeating the inspiriting, catchy slogan, ''Just say no.''</p>
        <p>It's never a good idea for a satirist to reveal those subjects he believes to be out of bounds. It invites someone else to come along and satirize them successfully. It also removes the possibility of danger and suspense. Once we know the limits beyond which the satirist will not go, we feel profoundly cheated, as if someone had told us the ending of ''Fatal Attraction.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Waters doesn't concern himself with the so-called larger issues, although, whether he knows it or not, he deals with them, sometimes hilariously, through his preoccupation with the detritus of our civilization. When and if the earth loses its ozone layer, and when all of us are walking around with hideous skin cancers that have transformed us into creatures from the Black Lagoon, scientists will be able to pinpoint what happened just by studying ''Hairspray.''</p>
        <p>Coming after ''Pink Flamingos,'' ''Female Trouble'' and ''Polyester,'' Mr. Waters's new film is very much mainstream. It features no dog droppings (''Pink Flamingos'') and is being presented without the aid of Odorama, the scratch-and-sniff card that was the new screen technique of ''Polyester.''</p>
        <p>In a season in which most commercial movies are trash pretending to be something else, ''Hairspray'' looks like seminal cinema art. It's a genuinely satiric and (I hope my mouth won't be washed out with soap) sweet movie, which pretends to be trash. It's a frequently witty recollection of the early 1960's, viewed not in hindsight's soft, sometimes anachronistic focus (see ''Dirty Dancing'') but as if it were a sincere, if eccentric, appropriately garish, teen-age movie made in its own time.</p>
        <p>Tracy (Ricki Lake) is a pretty, overweight, dancing (the Madison, the Mashed Potato, among others) fool, the daughter of Wilbur (Jerry Stiller) and Edna Turnblad (Divine), who put great store by being genteel. As described by her high school teacher, Tracy is ''an upper-lower-class teen-ager.'' She has a beehive hairdo that won't quit and a burning ambition to become a star on ''The Corny Collins Show,'' the local television spinoff of Dick Clark's afternoon dance program, as well as Miss Auto Show of Baltimore of 1962.</p>
        <p>Tracy's principal rival is Amber Von Tussle (Colleen Fitzpatrick), who is fashionably slim and ferociously jealous, and whose consumption of hair spray, says her dad (Sonny Bono), eats up all the profits from his Tilt-a-Whirl. To add a dash of social uplift to the proceedings, which is what Sam Katzman, the B-picture producer, liked to do in the 1950's and 1960's, Tracy is a girl who fights to integrate the Corny Collins show, much to the horror of the ultraconservative Von Tussles.</p>
        <p>Tracy's rise to celebrityhood is not easy, but neither is it especially difficult. ''Hairspray'' doesn't exactly get bogged down in plot. Instead, it's about the quality of American aspirations (then and now) as reflected in American movies. When Tracy becomes a Corny Collins star, the ecstatic Edna Turnblad envisions her as nothing less than a June Taylor dancer. The sky's the limit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Waters loves the bizarre (he is reported to have an electric chair in his living room), as well as camp, but ''Hairspray'' is so circumspect that it could be adored by Edna Turnblad. As played by Divine, the 200-pound actor born Harris Glenn Milstead, Edna is a great, cheerful, eye-boggling cartoon. Even when her diet pills are wearing off, she's forever patient with her difficult daughter. She's the voice of reason in adversity (''Remember, you can't change the world's problems in a day''), though occasionally she does get exasperated (''Once again your hairdo has gotten you in hot water''). When the chips are down, though, she enthusiastically supports Tracy's leap toward stardom.</p>
        <p>One of the film's funniest sequences takes place in the Hefty Hideaway (''Big Is Beautiful''), where both Tracy and Edna are able to purchase swinging fashions for the portly. Divine is equally funny, and hardly recognizable, as the bigoted owner of Corny Collins's television station.</p>
        <p>Divine, the icon of the cinema of John Waters, died suddenly last week in Hollywood, and just as his singular talent was being widely recognized. Though he always resisted being identified as a female impersonator, it's what he did best as an increasingly self-assured actor. His barrel shape, teetering precariously atop high heels, defined Mr. Waters's risky comic method as much as any other image.</p>
        <p>Divine dominates ''Hairspray,'' even if his two roles are essentially supporting ones. However, young Miss Lake is no slouch when it comes to guarding scenes that might otherwise have been stolen by Divine. Miss Lake is an intense charmer. When she bubbles with excitement, she's both a character within the film and a comic mock-up of the steel-willed teen-age actress, circa 1960, doing her darndest to please.</p>
        <p>With the exception of Pia Zadora, who makes a not-great cameo appearance, all the members of the cast are terrifically winning, becoming (and this is intended as praise) as much a part of the Waters landscape as the period music and dancing, the clothes, the vinyl-covered furniture and the all-important beehives.</p>
        <p>Mr. Waters is a genuinely funny man. He's also an invigorating film critic. His essay on Jean-Luc Godard's ''Hail Mary,'' in ''Crackpot,'' is one of the most perceptive reviews yet written about that curious movie. Further, his tone is on the mark when he's describing it: ''When the Savior runs away, saying 'I must attend to my Father's work,' Joseph asks, 'When will he be back?' Mary answers in what must be the most hilarious line of the movie, 'Easter.' ''</p>
        <p>Writes Mr. Waters, ''The bottom line: ''Would Flannery O'Connor have liked 'Hail Mary'?''</p>
        <p>He is equally articulate about the films of Marguerite Duras (''maddeningly boring, but really quite beautiful''), would love to see a museum do a retrospective devoted to nudist-camp films, and thinks that Liberace would have made the ideal homicidal loon in a ''Texas Chainsaw'' type of horror film. ''Picture him chasing Drew Barrymore across a swamp with a buzzing chain saw and you can envision a mega-hit of staggering proportions.''</p>
        <p>He also has good advice for film students, who, he says, ''waste too much time studying 'masterpieces.' '' A much more practical syllabus: ''Hit and Run Film Making,'' ''Avoiding the Unions'' and ''To Hell with Completion Bonds.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Waters adores the tacky on screen, and loathes it in real life as represented by, among other things, the waiter who says, ''Hi, my name is Bill. Can I help you?'' His response: ''I came here to eat, not to make friends. Just give me eggs and bacon and hold the biography.''  FILM VIEW</p>
