        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Had our ecology class not been studying Lester R. Brown's "State of the World 1991," we too would have attributed the hole in the ozone layer to the use of chlorofluorocarbons in styrofoam, industrial solvents, and coolants for refrigerators and air conditioners ("Senate Backs Faster Protection of Ozone Layer as Bush Relents," front page, Feb. 7).</p>
        <p>But according to Brown, these civilian uses of ozone-depleting substances are minimal compared with the military's uses: "The U.S. Defense Department is a major user of Halon-1211 and CFC-113, accounting for 76% and just under 50% of total U.S. use of these two compounds, respectively. Together, these two chemicals are responsible for 13 percent of overall ozone depletion." And "each shuttle launch deposits 56 tons of chlorine into the upper atmosphere." The B-2 bomber "relies on a fuel additive that is a potent ozone depleter." It's time to hold the military accountable. RUTH ROSENBERG Adj. Asst. Prof., Kingsborough Community College, CUNY Brooklyn, Feb. 7, 1992</p>
