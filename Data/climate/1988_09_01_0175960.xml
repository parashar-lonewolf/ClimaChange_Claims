        <p>LEAD: The next President of the United States will be more aggressive in protecting the environment than President Reagan has been, judging by the campaign pledges and positions of both candidates.</p>
        <p>The next President of the United States will be more aggressive in protecting the environment than President Reagan has been, judging by the campaign pledges and positions of both candidates.</p>
        <p>But environmentalists say the records of Vice President Bush and his Democratic rival, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, do not offer grounds for unallayed optimism.</p>
        <p>A promise to act decisively to reduce acid rain, made by Mr. Bush in a speech on the environment today, is the latest in a series of statements in which the Vice President has sought to distance himself from the environmental policies of the Reagan Administration, some of which he was instrumental in implementing. 'I Will Do More'</p>
        <p>Mr. Reagan, who sought to relieve industry of the burden of excessive regulation, is widely regarded by environmentalists and other critics as a foe of strict constraints on pollution. And Mr. Bush, in a recent answer to a questionnaire from the League of Conservation Voters, the political arm of many of the national environmental groups, said:</p>
        <p>''In the past few years we have not done enough to protect the environment. I will do more.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dukakis, meanwhile, has been promising environmental policies and actions that would overcome what he termed ''the legacy of neglect'' left by the current Administration.</p>
        <p>Neither candidate has yet been endorsed by the League of Conservation Voters or other major environmental organizations. Earlier this year, the league graded the candidates based on their past environmental performance. Mr. Dukakis received a ''B.'' Mr. Bush was given a ''D.'' Zeal for Deregulation</p>
        <p>Jim Maddy, executive director of the league, said that the low grade for Mr. Bush was based largely on the Vice President's role, as head of the President's Task Force on Regulatory Reform, in leading the Administration's assault on the regulatory powers of the Environmental Protection Agency. ''We all know that a Vice President is not a free agent, but Bush went about it with great zeal, determination and visibility,'' Mr. Maddy said.</p>
        <p>But he added, ''If you go back 20 years, when George Bush was a Republican Congressman from Texas, he had a good progressive record on the environment.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dukakis's higher grade from the league was based, Mr. Maddy said, on his record as Governor. ''When environmental and political leaders succeeded in getting him to focus on the environment he produced,'' Mr. Maddy said. ''He made good appointments, had a constructive budget and got out front to work on the issues.''</p>
        <p>The reason Mr. Dukakis did not get an ''A,'' and the source of underlying concern about the value of his environmental promises in the campaign, is that ''for long periods he did not focus on environmental issues,'' Mr. Maddy said. He cited the Governor's failure to act quickly to clean up Boston Harbor, which for many years was the depository of raw sewage because there was no treatment plant. Bush's Record, Pro and Con</p>
        <p>Representative James J. Florio, a New Jersey Democrat who is active on environmental issues, echoed many environmentalists when he said Mr. Bush's portrayal of himself as concerned with the environment ''blows my mind: it is almost Orwellian.''</p>
        <p>But C. Boyden Gray, counselor to the Vice President, said Mr. Bush had compiled an impressive environmental record.</p>
        <p>He noted that Mr. Bush had publicly supported research into alternative fuels for motor vehicles, and said he had argued within the Administration for it to support a treaty to reduce the production of chemicals that are destroying Earth's protective ozone shield. He said he also urged the Administration to join in an international convention limiting pollution from nitrogen oxide, a component of acid rain, the phenomenom by which airborn pollutants make some bodies of fresh water so acidic they cannot support life.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gray also noted that it was left to the E.P.A. to prevent construction of a shopping mall that would have destroyed valuable wetlands in Massachusetts after Governor Dukakis had approved a permit for the mall. He also said Mr. Dukakis had failed to use money made available by the Administration to clean up Boston Harbor. Stances on Key Issues</p>
        <p>In their responses to the League of Conservation Voters' questionnaire, in their position papers and other statements, both candidates have said they regard environmental protection as crucial to the nation's physical and economic well being and would give it high priority if elected.</p>
        <p>Here is how the two men say they would deal with some major environmental issues:  General Policy</p>
        <p>Both candidates agree that there has not been enough done to protect the environment during the Reagan Administration, but neither is willing to commit to spending a lot more money on the environment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dukakis would revoke President Reagan's executive order giving the Office of Management and Budget power to slow or block regulatory decisions, including decisions made by E.P.A. on how to carry out the environmental laws. Mr. Bush pledges only that he would enforce the laws.  Clean Air</p>
        <p>Both candidates have endorsed a program to sharply reduce the pollution that causes acid rain, largely sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Both regard global warming caused by man-made gases that retain heat in the atmosphere as a significant threat to the environment and would call a meeting of world leaders to address it.  Nuclear Energy</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush supports continued use of nuclear energy as long as there are high safety standards. He feels its use would fight global warming by reducing the use of fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dukakis, while not ruling out some future role for nuclear power, takes a skeptical view of its safety and economic feasibility. As Governor, he was opposed to the construction of the Seabrook nuclear power plant in neighboring New Hampshire. He says he would place more reliance on energy conservation to reduce the nation's reliance on coal and oil.  Public Lands</p>
        <p>Mr. Dukakis supports creating a trust fund to pay for the acquisition of national parks and other public lands, as was proposed two years ago by the President's Commission on Americans Outdoors. But he said he could not commit himself to the $1 billion a year for the fund that was recommended.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said he supported the work of the commission in general but would not specifically endorse a trust fund.  Arctic Wildlife Refuge</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said that he was sympathetic to the concept of protected wilderness areas but that he supported oil and gas development in the refuge, which environmental groups are fighting. Mr. Dukakis said he would back oil development in the refuge only if absolutely necessary.</p>
