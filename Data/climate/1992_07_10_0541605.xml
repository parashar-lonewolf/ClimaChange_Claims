        <p>When he announced last summer that he would not run for President this year, Senator Al Gore of Tennessee said he had too many family responsibilities. But Mr. Gore left no doubt about his ultimate ambition.</p>
        <p>"I would like to be President," he said.</p>
        <p>The thought has been in his mind and that of his family since he was a child. "We raised him for it," Mr. Gore's father, a Representative and Senator for more than 30 years, said in an interview today.</p>
        <p>A Representative at the age of 28, a Senator at 36 and an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination at 39, Mr. Gore, now 44, is tall and broad-shouldered, somewhat resembling Christopher Reeve, the actor who played Superman. Served in Vietnam</p>
        <p>Like Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, he has an Ivy League education, middle-of-the-road positions on most issues and a strong-willed wife.</p>
        <p>But unlike Mr. Clinton, Mr. Gore has a long public record on foreign and military matters. He enlisted in the Army and served in Vietnam, despite his opposition to the war. Now he is a strong advocate of environmental causes, an area where Mr. Clinton has been criticized.</p>
        <p>And potentially most important to the Clinton campaign, Mr. Gore has a reputation as a straight arrow who will probably not be vulnerable to the Republican stiletto on personal problems and family values.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic Presidential nomination four years ago often seemed unfocused, characterized by shifts in emphasis if not in positions. He did reasonably well in the Southern primaries but dropped out after a poor showing in New York. Still, the experience and the contacts he made in that national campaign could prove valuable in this year's race.</p>
        <p>Since his 1988 campaign, Mr. Gore, who is 19 months younger than Mr. Clinton, has concentrated on foreign policy, technology and environmental issues. He was one of 10 Democratic Senators who broke with their party's leaders and voted to give President Bush authority to wage war against Iraq. He wrote a book on ecology that was on The New York Times best-seller list for six weeks this spring. And he led the Senate delegation to the United Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, who was elected to the House of Representatives in 1976 and to the Senate eight years later, has made a legislative career of mastering complicated issues like arms control, global warming, biotechnology and computer networks.</p>
        <p>"He is extremely intelligent, superbly educated, very industrious and single-minded," said Jim Sasser, the senior Democratic Senator from Tennessee. "His style is to learn absolutely everything there is to know about an issue."</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore has often seemed bored with the legislative process -- more interested in holding hearings and exploring ideas than in making deals and writing laws. In that regard, he is more like John F. Kennedy, who was an indifferent lawmaker, than Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee four years ago, who is a master of the art of legislating.</p>
        <p>As a child, Albert Arnold Gore Jr. led something of a double life. His father, Albert Gore Sr., was a Representative and Senator for more than 30 years, a New Deal populist on social issues and at the end of his career, one of the Senate's fiercest opponents of the war in Vietnam. His mother, Pauline, is a lawyer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore was born in Washington on March 31, 1948. During the school year, he lived in his parents' suite at the Fairfax Hotel on Embassy Row and had his head patted by many of the most prominent politicians in the country. He graduated from St. Alban's Episcopal School for Boys in Washington, where he was a top student and played football and basketball.</p>
        <p>As a counterweight, he spent the summers on the family farm in Carthage, Tenn., about 40 miles east of Nashville. He worked in the fields with the tenant farmers during the days and hunted with coon dogs at night. Opposed Vietnam War</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore enrolled at Harvard University in 1965 and became active in the antiwar movement. He worked on Senator Eugene J. McCarthy's Presidential campaign in 1968 and graduated with honors in government in 1969.</p>
        <p>As a student, he has said, he occasionally smoked marijuana. But he said he had not used drugs since he became a politician.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore considered going to Canada to avoid Vietnam. But after agonizing with his family and friends, he enlisted in the Army, despite his opposition to the war. Friends say the deciding factor was that his father was up for re-election to the Senate, and Mr. Gore did not want to impose on his father the political burden of having a draft-dodging son.</p>
        <p>Albert Gore Sr. lost the 1970 election, anyway, to the Republican Bill Brock, and the main campaign issue was Vietnam. Now in their 80's and still active, the senior Gores live on their farm in Carthage.</p>
        <p>In Vietnam for about a year, Mr. Gore was a journalist with an engineering unit; he never saw combat. But he did sometimes carry a rifle, and in his campaign literature, he has often used a photograph of himself in full uniform, carrying his weapon.</p>
        <p>Just before he left for Vietnam, he married Mary Elizabeth Aitcheson, whom he had met at a party the night of his high school graduation. Known as Tipper, Mrs. Gore, who has a master's degree in psychology, has led campaigns against what she considers to be the bad influence of pop culture on children. She has written a book called "Raising PG Kids in an X-Rated Society" (Abingdon Press, 1987).</p>
        <p>The Gores, who are Baptists, have four children: Karenna, 18; Kristen, 15; Sara, 13, and Albert 3d, 9, all of whom attend private schools.</p>
        <p>Financially, the Gores are comfortable but not so well off as most other senators. Their assets total less than $1 million, and most of that is tied up in two homes, one in Arlington, Va., the house Mrs. Gore grew up in, and the other in Carthage.</p>
        <p>After he returned from Vietnam, Mr. Gore went to work as a reporter and later an editorial writer for The Tennessean in Nashville.</p>
        <p>His career as a journalist ended in 1976 when Joe L. Evins, the veteran Democratic Representative from the district that Mr. Gore's father once represented, decided to retire. Mr. Gore immediately moved to Carthage and ran successfully for the office.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Gore had been in the House for eight years, Senator Howard H. Baker Jr., a Republican, decided not to run for re-election. Mr. Gore easily won the seat. He was re-elected in 1990.</p>
        <p>As a campaign speaker, Mr. Gore is erratic -- spirited and evocative one night and flat and routine the next. He often uses a shouting cadence that works better with large audiences than with smaller gatherings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's position on abortion is somewhat different from Mr. Clinton's and from the plank in this year's Democratic platform. He opposes Government financing of abortions for poor women. Since the mid-1980's, Mr. Gore has favored legal abortions, although before that, he was less firm.</p>
        <p>Beyond that, Mr. Gore's stances on issues are similar to the ones Mr. Clinton has expressed. This year, for example, Mr. Gore has been a chief sponsor of a measure that would raise the income taxes of the wealthy and use the money to give a tax break to middle-class families with children. That is also a pet proposal of Mr. Clinton's. Position on Gulf War</p>
        <p>On military issues, Mr. Gore has usually stood slightly to the right of the Democratic Party's center. He called his decision to support President Bush on the war in the Persian Gulf "excruciating," but told the Senate he believed that the risks of not going to war were ultimately "larger, greater and more costly" than the risks of going to war.</p>
        <p>After the war, he attacked the Bush Administration for criticizing Democrats who voted against the war resolution, and he urged the President to use American troops to ground Iraqi helicopters that were killing fleeing Kurds and Shiites. "We cannot wash our hands of what's going on over there," he said at the time.</p>
        <p>On domestic and economic issues, he has generally voted as a liberal Democrat. He voted against Clarence Thomas's confirmation to the Supreme Court because, he said, Judge Thomas's constitutional stands "embraced the extreme." Mr. Gore also said he found Anita F. Hill's testimony about Judge Thomas and sexual harassment "honest and credible."</p>
        <p>His book, "Earth in the Balance: Ecology and the Human Spirit" (Houghton Mifflin, 1992), assesses forces like overpopulation, deforestation, soil erosion, air and water pollution, and concludes that now that the cold war is over, destruction of the environment is the greatest threat to mankind.</p>
        <p>Most politicians do not have the patience to read and study. Mr. Gore does, and one of his main strengths is his ability to master and explain complicated topics.</p>
        <p>His close friend, Representative Thomas J. Downey, Democrat from Long Island, recalled today a small dinner party a few months ago when Mr. Gore was explaining an environmental principle on the back of a napkin to Chen Ning Yang, who holds a Nobel Prize in physics and teaches at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.</p>
        <p>"Imagine," Mr. Downey said, "a United States Senator explaining a scientific principle to Professor Yang."</p>
