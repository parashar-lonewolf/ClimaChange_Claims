      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The station wagon is coming back.</p>
        <p>Sort of.</p>
        <p>The next big thing, according to automakers, is a class of vehicles that will have three rows of seats and look like bulked-up station wagons or slimmed-down minivans. Automakers say the new wagons will appeal to families who want space for the children but do not want something as cumbersome or costly at the gas pump as a sport utility vehicle. They are also meant to attract drivers who want more space and prefer the handling and looks of a luxury car.</p>
        <p>Though the automakers say these new vehicles, like the Pacifica from Chrysler and the SRX from Cadillac, are being introduced because consumers want them, there is another practical motivation: helping the companies meet fuel standards.</p>
        <p>Traditional station wagons were classified as cars under federal fuel economy rules. These vehicles will probably be classified as light trucks, a category that also includes sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks that are less fuel efficient.</p>
        <p>Including this new type of vehicle in that group could allow automakers to build more gas guzzlers and still meet federal standards for fuel economy. Fuel economy regulations require automakers to meet fleetwide averages that work like a seesaw. Roughly speaking, for every big truck, there must be a little truck; for every big car, a little car.</p>
        <p>Some of these wagons are so big, though, they might not meet even the mileage standard for light trucks.</p>
        <p>The bulking up of the wagon has already begun with several sporty-looking offerings being sold on their rugged appeal, like the Audi allroad quattro, the Subaru Forester and the Volvo V70 Cross Country. Like traditional wagons, these models have two rows of forward-facing seats, but federal regulations permit automakers to categorize them as light trucks because of ''off road'' features like all-wheel drive and more than eight inches of ground clearance.</p>
        <p>Having the Volvo categorized as a truck helps its parent, the Ford Motor Company, meet its fuel standards, because the Cross Country gets about 22 miles per gallon, below the 27.5 m.p.g. standard for passenger cars but above the 20.7 m.p.g. standard for light trucks.</p>
        <p>Volkswagen, Audi's parent, traditionally pays fines because its fleet of light trucks does not meet United States fuel standards. The allroad, which gets about 18 m.p.g., does not even meet the light truck standard, but is far below the passenger car average.</p>
        <p>The allroad appeals to ''someone who's athletic and enjoys activities,'' says Chris Prodromides, sales manager at Pacific Audi in Hermosa Beach, Calif. ''It can be a luxury touring sedan, a family hauler, and it can go off road. And it has a really aggressive look.''</p>
        <p>This first crop of rugged wagons, which sell for as little as $20,000 or as much as $40,000, presage even bigger models that are in the works or will start arriving next year from the Big Three as well as Nissan, Volkswagen and Audi. The new wagons will have a third row of seats that face forward, and some appear to be designed so that the area behind the front seats can be configured into a flat loading floor, like a truck bed. Chrysler used this configuration to have its PT Cruiser categorized as a light truck.</p>
        <p>Detroit does not want its latest inventions mistaken for the wood-paneled boats of old.</p>
        <p>'' 'Station wagon' has a negative connotation,'' said Christopher Cedergren, an industry analyst with Nextrend Inc. of Thousand Oaks, Calif., adding that baby boomer auto executives were concerned about conjuring images of the Country Squire, a bloated Ford station wagon of days gone by.</p>
        <p>Defining categories is becoming difficult as features of cars and trucks are increasingly blended into ''crossover'' vehicles that defy distinction. One recent Toyota advertisement for its new Matrix, a sleek, small version of a wagon, has a spy struggling to define it.</p>
        <p>DaimlerChrysler has called them ''sports tourers.'' They are also being called ''tall wagons,'' ''luxury crossover vehicles,'' ''sport utility wagons'' or ''sport wagons.''</p>
        <p>The Pacifica wagon, which the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler is developing for middle-class families seeking deluxe suburban transportation rather than off-road rigor, is expected to come out next spring and start around $30,000. Daimler-Chrysler has a similar concept in the works for wealthier suburbanites with the Mercedes-Benz Vision GST (for ''grand sports tourer'') but has not made a final decision on whether to produce it in the United States.</p>
        <p>Chrysler, which made the first minivan in 1983 and sold about 550,000 of them last year, is preparing to build more than 100,000 Pacificas next year, making it a major addition to the Chrysler fleet.</p>
        <p>''We're confident this vehicle will follow the success of our original minivan,'' said Bryan Zvibleman, a company spokesman. He said Chrysler thought the new wagons could be as popular as its minivans, which have had sales of more than nine million over the years. ''There is no other vehicle out there like this,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Pacifica is three inches shorter than a Honda Odyssey minivan and not quite as long, but nine inches taller than the more traditional Ford Taurus station wagon.</p>
        <p>General Motors will enter the field next year with the Cadillac SRX. ''We refer to this as a luxury crossover,'' said Kelly Cusinato, a spokeswoman for Cadillac. ''It's not a wagon.''</p>
        <p>Ford is developing its own entry, tentatively called the Crosstrainer, after the athletic shoes -- ''running shoes that do more than one job for multiple purposes,'' said Dan Bedore, a Ford spokesman. The company is trying to convey that the Cross trainer is more versatile than, say, the Taurus station wagon.</p>
        <p>''It's for those people who are sedan or wagon people and not interested in, or ready to plunge into, the full-blown S.U.V.,'' Mr. Bedore added. ''It does it all in a more fuel-efficient package.''</p>
        <p>Although the crossover vehicles will probably be less fuel-efficient than traditional station wagons, many are expected to deliver better-than-average mileage for light trucks. For automakers grappling with stagnant sales of passenger vehicles, that is an attractive advantage.</p>
        <p>Last week, the Senate voted to keep separate fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks, rejecting a proposal by Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, to create much tougher requirements, in part by blending car and truck averages. Instead of keeping it a matter of Congressional concern, the Senate voted to let the Bush administration review mileage standards.</p>
        <p>Given that light trucks -- S.U.V.'s, minivans and pickups -- outsold passenger cars for the first time last year, it is becoming more important for automakers to find ways to keep meeting minimum mileage requirements for trucks.</p>
        <p>Detroit executives say the old station wagon's decline had less to do with changing tastes than the adoption of the fuel standards in the 1970's. The old station wagon was the biggest gas guzzler among cars, so Detroit came up with S.U.V.'s and minivans, people haulers that are trucks.</p>
        <p>But that did not mean people stopped wanting big vehicles that handled more like cars.</p>
        <p>''These are loophole-riding vehicles,'' said Daniel F. Becker, who monitors global warming and energy issues for the Sierra Club. ''But they're defined as trucks to evade environmental and oil-saving laws.''</p>
        <p>Dennis Fitzgibbons, a spokesman in Chrysler's Washington office, countered that there was a substantive difference between traditional station wagons and new ''tall wagons.''</p>
        <p>''Pacifica can accommodate six or eight people and a large amount of cargo,'' he said. ''Is it fair to put that in the same category as a vehicle that can accommodate four or five people and a much smaller amount of cargo?''</p>
        <p>Pacifica has a second row of seats akin to those in a first-class airline cabin -- captain's chairs similar to the driver's and the front passenger's seats, with the same adjustability and heating. The Pacifica's third row is a bench seat. The Cadillac SRX has a similar arrangement, as does a prototype from Audi, the Avantissimo.</p>
        <p>It would be hard to overstate the importance of these don't-call-them-station-wagons to automakers who are worried that the S.U.V. craze might have peaked. At the North American International Auto Show in January, for instance, Chrysler's top executives performed a mock stage version of ''The Dick Van Dyke Show'' to promote the Pacifica.</p>
        <p>Dieter Zetsche, Chrysler's mustachioed chief executive, was a nosy neighbor in need of eggs to make strudel, but he ended up helping Rob and Laura Petrie find the dream machine -- sort of an S.U.V., sort of a car -- that they really wanted but just didn't think existed.</p>
