        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The problem with hydrogen as a fuel goes much beyond the safety issues raised in ''Alternative Fuel Loses Another Alternative'' (Feb. 19).</p>
        <p>Hydrogen is not an energy source, but rather an energy carrier. What this means is that we must make the hydrogen from other compounds that have the hydrogen embedded in it.</p>
        <p>One of those sources is natural gas. Another obvious choice is water. In both cases, it takes energy to make the hydrogen from these compounds. And in turn using energy to make the hydrogen will inevitably produce unwanted global warming gases. (Unless, of course, the power source is nuclear power.)</p>
        <p>As a consequence, Federated Conservationists of Westchester County (of which I am a board member) is looking to a variety of other schemes to recommend either low-polluting measures, such as low production of global warming gases, or renewable sources for hydrogen production. While the latter seems promising, both the scale and major requirements for either wind or solar production seem very difficult at this time.</p>
        <p>Adding to that is the infrastructure required for nationwide distribution of hydrogen as the fuel of choice. We now have oil and gas pipelines; the costs associated with an efficient hydrogen pipeline are exceedingly high at current pricing.</p>
