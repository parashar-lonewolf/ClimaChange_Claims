        <p>A2-14</p>
        <p>Funeral Mass for the Pope Draws Immense Crowds  Pope John Paul II was buried after a funeral Mass that attracted admirers from the around the world, the important and the ordinary alike, in the hundreds of thousands. Amid tight security and worry over a terror attack, helicopter rotors chopped through the sound of hymns throughout the three-hour ceremony.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>The pope's funeral Mass began nine days of spiritual mourning, but it also opened a political chapter -- the subtle campaigning before the gathering of cardinals in a conclave starting April 18 to elect a successor.</p>

        <p>Prayer to Follow Royal Wedding  Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles, who have been lovers, on and off, for the past 30 years, plan to follow their wedding ceremony with a religious blessing, the centerpiece of which will be a stern prayer of penitence from the 1662 Book of Common Prayer.</p>

        <p>Epidemic in Angola Spreading  The death toll in Angola from an epidemic caused by the Marburg virus rose to 174 as some aid workers reported that terrified people had attacked them and that a number of health workers had fled out of fear of catching the disease. Seven of Angola's 18 provinces have now reported suspected cases.</p>

        <p>Bush Vows to Press Sharon  President Bush said he would press Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel to halt the expansion of an Israeli settlement on the West Bank. Mr. Bush also said he would encourage Mr. Sharon to work with the new Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, to ensure that the Palestinians succeed in bringing jobs and stability to Gaza.</p>

        <p>North Korean Weapons Talks  There have been two senior-level meetings between North Korean and Chinese leaders over the last two weeks to discuss the North's nuclear-weapons program, but the Chinese have failed so far to persuade North Korea to rejoin nuclear disarmament talks. Informal discussions have begun on new, more aggressive strategies.</p>
        <p>A14</p>
        <p>Japanese Goods Protested  Several thousand young Chinese marched through Beijing's high-tech district, calling for a boycott of Japanese-made goods, a rare legal protest that underscored the sharp deterioration in relations between Asia's two most powerful countries.</p>

        <p>New Inquiry of Researcher  A Chinese researcher for The New York Times who has been held incommunicado for seven months on suspicion of leaking state secrets is now being investigated for financial fraud.</p>
