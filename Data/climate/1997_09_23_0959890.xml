        <p>Polish Leader Ponders Strategy  After the surprise victory of the Solidarity coalition in Poland's elections, Marian Krzaklewski, the party leader, has set about clarifying his intentions and building a Government. He has said that he would prefer to run his party's parliamentary caucus than to be made Prime Minister. Many think that he would prefer to wait three years and run against President Aleksander Kwasniewski, a former Communist.</p>

        <p>Clinton Addresses the U.N.  President Clinton told the United Nations General Assembly that he is asking the Senate to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. In all, 146 nations have signed the treaty, but of the 44 countries that must ratify it, only Japan has done so. Mr. Clinton also urged the creation of a permanent international court by the end of the century to prosecute ''the most serious violations of humanitarian law.''</p>

        <p>Pakistan Leader Courts India  Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan invited India to open negotiations on a mutual ''nonaggression pact.'' After his speech to the United Nations General Assembly, he dined with President Clinton and Prime Minister I. K. Gujral of India.</p>

        <p>Gore Presses Russia on Bill  Vice President Al Gore said his first topic in talks with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin of Russia in the town of Bor was the United States's objection to a new bill designed to protect the Russian Orthodox Church against competition from other Christian faiths.</p>

        <p>Challenge to Serb Socialists  Partial returns in the Serbian presidential and parliamentary elections forecast the need for a second round of voting for the presidency, a setback for the Socialist alliance of Yugoslavia's President, Slobodan Milosevic. The hard-line nationalist Radical Prty was close behind the Socialists, and the returns indicated that no party would win an outright parliamentary majority. A boycott by opposition parties hoping that an inadequate turnout would invalidate the elections failed.</p>

        <p>South African Lawsuit Dropped  South Africa's National Party dropped its lawsuit against the country's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The party relented after receiving formal apologies from two of the commission's leaders for remarks they made about the credibility of the testimony of former President F. W. de Klerk in May. Mr. de Klerk had said his party, which ruled South Africa during apartheid, had never authorized killings to combat anti-apartheid forces.</p>

        <p>Thalidomide May Be Used To Treat Several Diseases  Thalidomide, the drug whose use in the 1960's produced thousands of deformed babies, is on the verge of receiving approval from the Food and Drug Administration for use in leprosy patients, nearly four decades after the agency rejected it for use in the United States. But experts expect doctors to begin prescribing it quickly for ''off-label'' uses. Thalidomide has been experiencing a revival of sorts, and scientists are experimenting with it for everything from AIDS to brain cancer and other autoimmune diseases.</p>

        <p>Clinton Defends Fund-Raising  President Clinton said he was confident neither he nor his campaign broke ''the letter of the law'' in fund-raising. But the chairman of the Senate committee investigating the question says everything he has found points toward the need for an independent counsel.</p>

        <p>F.D.A. Bill Nears Vote  A bill to speed review for many medical devices and drugs is expected to come to a vote on the Senate floor this week. Senator Edward M. Kennedy has filibustered the legislation, which outlines the authority given to the Food and Drug Administration, winning concessions for causes he calls ''pro-consumer.''</p>

        <p>Crew Rejects School's Plan To Preserve Teaching Job  A group of parents who raised more than $46,000 to preserve a teacher's job and keep class size down at their school were rebuffed by Chancellor Rudy Crew, who said the fund-raising drive was unfair to other schools with large class sizes.</p>

        <p>Mayoral Rivals Trade Charges  Mayor Giuliani and Ruth W. Messinger delved into the past, searching for information that they could use to derail each other's mayoral candidacies. The Mayor accused Ms. Messinger of holding a party in 1979 for an inmate convicted of killing an Attica Prison guard. Ms. Messinger responded by saying Mr. Giuliani tried to dodge the draft in 1969.</p>

        <p>Sharpton Wins Round in Court  A New York State Supreme Court justice ordered an immediate hearing into the Rev. Al Sharpton's allegation that he was unfairly denied a runoff bid because the vote count following the Democratic mayoral primary on Sept. 9 was riddled with fraud and other irregularities.</p>
