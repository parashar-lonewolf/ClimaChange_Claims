      <abstract>
        <p>Since mid-October, Britain has been pummeled by rain, whipped by winds and buffeted by storms that have caused untold millions of dollars in damage, wreaked havoc with roads and trains, and left thousands of people without habitable homes; at least 12 people have been killed, mostly from trees falling on their cars as they tried to drive through wind and rain; in Yalding, Kent, flooding has been so severe that firefighters swim down streets, cars float away, houses have been destroyed and residents have been evacuated by boat; photos; map (M)</p>

        <p>True, hordes of voracious locusts have not yet emerged from nowhere in a demonstration of divine wrath. But after the rains, the floods, the windstorms and the torrents of raw sewage, the residents of this little country village would not be particularly surprised if they did.</p>
        <p>''Do you want to be really depressed?'' asked Ian Scott, 55, beckoning down the path of his soggy garden, which did not smell very good, having been deluged by sewage-contaminated water three times in the last month. ''I'll show you what's left of our house.''</p>

        <p>True, hordes of voracious locusts have not yet emerged from nowhere in a demonstration of divine wrath. But after the rains, the floods, the windstorms and the torrents of raw sewage, the residents of this little country village would not be particularly surprised if they did.</p>
        <p>''Do you want to be really depressed?'' asked Ian Scott, 55, beckoning down the path of his soggy garden, which did not smell very good, having been deluged by sewage-contaminated water three times in the last month. ''I'll show you what's left of our house.''</p>
        <p>It was a sobering sight. The floor was gone, stripped down to rotting wooden beams. The appliances were gone, having floated down the road or become so waterlogged by filthy water as to be unusable. And Mr. Scott and his wife are more or less gone, too. They are living in a rented house in a nearby village.</p>
        <p>Yalding is in a rolling valley in Kent, one of Britain's loveliest counties. Nestled picturesquely at the intersection of three rivers -- the Tiese, the Beult and the Medway -- it is fortified to withstand the floods that come every year, spilling onto designated flood plains and lapping at doorsteps. But the village has not been at all prepared for the events of this fall: flooding so severe that firefighters have donned wet suits and swum down the street, battling the current, cars have floated away, houses have been destroyed and residents have had to be evacuated by boat.</p>
        <p>Nor were people in the rest of the country prepared for what happened to them. On and off since mid-October, Britain has been pummeled by rain, whipped by winds and buffeted  by storms that have caused untold millions of dollars in damage, wreaked havoc with roads and trains, and left thousands of people without habitable homes.</p>
        <p>At least 12 people have been killed, mostly from trees falling on their cars as they tried to drive through the wind and rain.</p>
        <p>The army has been frantically distributing sandbags as communities try to shore up their defenses. In York, with water licking at the floor of his 13th-century residence, the archbishop of York said, ''I feel like Noah in his ark.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, government officials have begun to speak with a new plainness about the devastating effects of global warming, predicting that the freakish storms that have struck here and much of Western Europe are harbingers of worse to come. So far this autumn, Britain --  which was complaining of a drought two years ago -- has endured one and a half times the average autumn's rainfall, for the wettest fall since records began 273 years ago.</p>
        <p>''The storms and floods being experienced across the U.K. are a wake-up call to the serious environmental threat posed by climate change,'' the environment minister, Michael Meacher, said today. ''Public opinion has underestimated just how drastic and severe these phenomena are, and it has brought it home to people better than a million political speeches.''</p>
        <p>The floods have had a domino effect. Train travel around much of Britain, already in chaos after a spate of accidents forced officials to cut train speed and to begin an emergency repair program, is now an improvisational prospect at best. On any given day, huge swaths of track might be closed for repairs. Some sections might be covered in water. Others might be littered with leaves and tree branches. And others might be buried in sludge.</p>
        <p>It has been doubly difficult for passengers because the train companies do not seem to know day by day, or even hour by hour, which services will be disrupted or for how long.</p>
        <p>''Has this put people in a bad mood?'' asked a ticket agent at Victoria Station in London the other day, as the voice on the loudspeaker announced that the train to Gatwick Airport had suddenly been canceled because of ''speed restrictions'' on the line. ''Everyone's always in a bad mood anyway, but now they finally have a reason.''</p>
        <p>The postal service has also been affected, with about 10 million first-class letters -- one-eighth the daily total -- delayed each day, mostly because the freight trains are running so sluggishly that the mail misses its next connection. In Lewes, Sussex, 35,000 letters and packages were soaked through when the post office was flooded, and then had to be destroyed after it was determined that they had been contaminated with raw sewage.</p>
        <p>At the Automobile Association, which monitors road conditions, operators have been scrambling to keep abreast of the latest dismaying information.</p>
        <p>''It's been an absolute nightmare here,'' said Paul Scott, a spokesman for the group. ''A lot of main roads, minor roads and whole town centers have been completely cut off in some places. We're having to deal with flood warnings, road closures, and trees falling, added to the usual rush-hour stuff.''</p>
        <p>In some areas, he advised, it is better to forget your car altogether. ''Because of the congestion, and with the roads being blocked, and not being passable at all, the police are saying you might as well stay at home because you're not going to get where you're going anyway,'' Mr. Scott said.</p>
        <p>None of this is really relevant just now to Kelly Bailey, 34, who wandered into the Yalding post office the other day to find out the latest news,  as everyone in the village has been doing. (A flood-damage meeting called for Tuesday night was canceled because of new flooding.) Mrs. Bailey has been living in a strange suspended state since the first storm, in October, when the rivers burst their banks and began to roll down the street in an inexorable tidal wave that rose to her knees in a matter of moments.</p>
        <p>When that flood came, Mrs. Bailey and her husband were just putting the finishing touches on the interior of the barn they had lovingly converted into a house. The kitchen had just been fitted; the carpets were on their way. The couple, who had been living next door in a trailer, planned to move in before Christmas.</p>
        <p>But as they stood, open-mouthed, a low growl turned into a roar and a brown cascade of freezing water began to chase them down the street. ''We threw our rabbits and the dog into a truck,'' Mrs. Bailey recalled. ''The kids -- the 3-year-old had no underpants on, only a shirt, and the 10-year-old wasn't wearing shoes or socks. The rabbits were squealing with the water coming up into their cages.''</p>
        <p>The new house is ruined and the Baileys are back in the trailer (the rabbits and dog are living with Mr. Bailey's mother). But it seems that their troubles are not over. Meteorologists predict rain and more rain, and the feeling is that nothing is likely to return to normal anytime soon.</p>
        <p>As she looked up at the sky, Mrs. Bailey was not at all happy to see the clouds gathering again.</p>
        <p>''I'm keeping my fingers crossed,'' she said. ''But every time it rains now, I just feel sick.''</p>
