        <p>Editorial urges Pres Bush to resist entreaties from oil friends to rescind longstanding presidential order barring oil and gas drilling in Alaska's pristine Bristol Bay</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>President Bush is thinking about rescinding a longstanding presidential order that specifically prohibits oil and gas drilling in Alaska's pristine Bristol Bay. He should resist the impulse to do so, no matter how powerful the entreaties from his friends in the oil business. Drilling in Bristol Bay would threaten one of the nation's most productive fisheries without appreciably strengthening the nation's long-term energy security.</p>
        <p>Bristol Bay occupies over 33 million acres of open sea, islands and estuaries just north of where the Aleutian Islands meet the Alaskan mainland. It is home to the world's largest wild salmon run and the source of a commercial fishing industry with an estimated annual value of nearly $2 billion. In the furor following the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, the bay was placed off limits to drilling, first by Congress, and then, in 1998, by President Clinton.</p>

        <p>President Bush is thinking about rescinding a longstanding presidential order that specifically prohibits oil and gas drilling in Alaska's pristine Bristol Bay. He should resist the impulse to do so, no matter how powerful the entreaties from his friends in the oil business. Drilling in Bristol Bay would threaten one of the nation's most productive fisheries without appreciably strengthening the nation's long-term energy security.</p>
        <p>Bristol Bay occupies over 33 million acres of open sea, islands and estuaries just north of where the Aleutian Islands meet the Alaskan mainland. It is home to the world's largest wild salmon run and the source of a commercial fishing industry with an estimated annual value of nearly $2 billion. In the furor following the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, the bay was placed off limits to drilling, first by Congress, and then, in 1998, by President Clinton.</p>
        <p>The presidential prohibition has remained in effect even though the Congressional moratorium was lifted in 2003 when Alaska's Ted Stevens -- overriding protests from local fishing interests -- called in all the chits he had accumulated as head of the Senate Appropriations Committee.</p>
        <p>The Interior Department now wants to make about one-fifth of the bay available for leasing -- a move, it says, that could create 11,000 jobs and ''net benefits'' of about $7.7 billion in oil and gas. But this would be a one-shot deal, and the numbers are trivial compared with the country's overall resources. More to the point, they pale in comparison to the sustainable year-after-year yields from a fishing industry that could be devastated -- as was Prince William Sound in 1989 -- by another major spill.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has been speaking out lately about the importance of making America more energy independent. Few things are more important for the new Democratic Congress than developing an energy policy more heavily weighted toward conservation, efficiency and development of alternatives to traditional fossil fuels. This might be a rare area in which both sides can work together, but opening Bristol Bay to drilling would be exactly the wrong way to begin the conversation.</p>
