        <p>ON shrinking beaches, the crowds are thicker than they used to be. More than half of America's population lives within 50 miles of the ocean or Great Lakes, and that proportion is rising quickly. And despite erosion, pollution and proliferating condos, each year more people go to the beach.</p>
        <p>That can be difficult, however. In most coastal states the public owns the beach from the water's edge to the high-tide mark, but getting there, or staking out a piece of dry sand, is another matter. To those on the inside looking out, whoever owns the beachfront owns the ocean. Property owners and municipalities, unsettled by the summer crowds, generally budge only when they have to. And, increasingly, to provide facilities for outsiders, locally run beaches charge admission fees.</p>
        <p>As basic principles of private property and public trust clash, most states are favoring the public. Florida has acquired 22 miles of sandy beachfront since 1982, and has set aside $5.5 million to acquire paths to the water through private property. In New Jersey, municipal beaches can no longer turn away nonresidents. California's Coastal Commission, although it was brushed back recently by the Supreme Court, has opened rights of way to many beaches near private homes.</p>
        <p>All efforts are frustrated by the erosion of almost every mile of coastline, from the narrowing barrier islands of the Atlantic to Louisiana, which is losing 100 acres a day, to California, where miles of bluff have crumbled into the ocean. The process, a consequence of rising sea levels, is hastened by overdevelopment.</p>
        <p>But the tide of people is rising, too. Five state beaches in Massachusetts had 970,000 visitors in 1976, 2.7 million in 1986. In that period attendance at Florida state parks, most of them on the beach, rose about 40 percent and would have been higher if the parks did not turn away visitors. Connecticut state beaches have also been turning people away this year.</p>
        <p>Making more room for the crowds makes economic and political sense for most states. The following reports describe what several of them are doing.  A TRADITION OF EXCLUSION</p>
        <p>In Massachusetts, where land can be owned all the way to the low-tide mark, beach walkers who wander onto private property can be chased away. When this happened to State Senator William M. Bulger, he undertook to change the law, and then started hearing from people who had been stopped on beachfront strolls by armed guards.</p>
        <p>Senator Bulger's bill, which is now before the Legislature for the third time and has passed the Senate, would allow the public to walk on the ''wet sand'' up to the high tide mark anywhere during daylight. That is the public's right in all but a few states. But Massachusetts in the 1640's granted private ownership down to the low-tide mark, exclusive to all but those engaged in ''fishing, fowling and navigation.''</p>
        <p>Times have changed, and recreational beaches are in ever-greater demand.</p>
        <p>Massachusetts' largest stretch of public beach is the 90-mile National Seashore on Cape Cod. But John Cronin, an aide to Mr. Bulger, said, ''Dozens of people call our office saying, 'I rented a place on Cape Cod for $800 a week, the public beaches were too crowded, so I took a walk off the public beach and was cut short by a guard with a weapon.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bulger's bill authorizes the state to take the wet sand by eminent domain, compensating the owners.</p>
        <p>The issue of compensation is now the subject of a bitter trial in Maine, which had the same colonial law as Massachusetts but has interpreted it differently.</p>
