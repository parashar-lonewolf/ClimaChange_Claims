        <p>Through a decade of scientific and political debate over global warming, private environmental groups were a driving force for a treaty committing industrial countries to fight the problem. The opponent always was industry, particularly oil and coal companies threatened by anything that might bring about an early end to the carbon age.</p>
        <p>So there was no shortage of consternation  on Saturday morning, when a rift between branches of the environmental movement appeared to have contributed to the failure of pivotal negotiations aimed at completing a pioneering climate treaty.</p>
        <p>The environmental groups that joined representatives of 175 countries in two weeks of rancorous negotiations at The Hague were sharply split. Some favored a pragmatic, if imperfect, approach -- if it got the world started toward healing the atmosphere. Others were unyielding, equating compromise with corruption. When these hard-liners ended up working in parallel with business interests who fought the treaty to avoid limits on industrial emissions, the result was deadlock.</p>
        <p>''When something like this is killed, it is killed by an alliance of those who want too much with those who don't want anything,'' said Dr. Michael Grubb, a professor of climate change and energy policy at Imperial College in London.</p>
        <p>Dr. Grubb and other scientists deeply involved in the battle over climate policy lamented the failure to find a middle ground, saying that extreme views on both sides of the issue unwittingly conspired.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, telephone lines buzzed as leaders of environmental groups around the world debated how to heal frayed relations and rebuild momentum toward global action to stem climate change.</p>
        <p>The session at The Hague was intended to write the detailed rules for carrying out the Kyoto Protocol, the treaty forged in 1997 in Japan that, by 2012, would require three dozen industrialized countries to have cut their combined emissions of greenhouse gases to 5 percent below 1990 levels.</p>
        <p>Through several meetings since then, writing the fine print had been fraught with challenges, mainly because modern life is powered by the burning of fossil fuels, the chief source of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
        <p>At Kyoto, a central issue was whether developing countries would be required to chip in on emissions cuts. But here, that issue quickly slid to the back burner in favor of the sharp dispute between the United States and the European Union, where the Green Party holds substantial sway.</p>
        <p>For example, one highly contentious debate centered on how much credit toward emissions targets countries should get for using forests or farmland to absorb carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas.</p>
        <p>The United States initially sought to get halfway to its emissions-cutting target by using its vast forests as a carbon dioxide ''sink.'' The European Union objected, saying it was a back-door way for the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases to reduce its target.</p>
        <p>Early Saturday morning, the United States and three negotiators representing Europe agreed on a pared-back proposal from the Americans.</p>
        <p>But when the rest of the European Union examined the deal, which included complicated calculations of forest acres and carbon tons, it was summarily rejected.</p>
        <p>Moments later, environmental groups associated with the European position began organizing a news conference.</p>
        <p>''We're better off with no deal than a bad deal,'' said Bill Hare, the top climate campaigner for Greenpeace International.</p>
        <p>The groups denounced the United States and other countries that sought forest credits, including Japan, Canada and Australia, as trying to weaken emission targets. But the United States was the focus of the most vitriol. ''The U.S. remained immovable in its desire to placate business and industry back home,'' said a Greenpeace leaflet.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere in the hall, representatives of more centrist environmental groups, mainly American, scrambled to counterattack.</p>
        <p>''Instead of working to protect the planet, the Europeans stumbled badly when presented with what was a crucial opportunity,'' said Fred Krupp, the executive director of Environmental Defense, a private American group that has focused on building environmental programs that have the support of industries.</p>
        <p>Days earlier, Dr. Stephen H. Schneider, a Stanford climatologist who has been active in the climate change debate for 20 years, had noted the intensifying clash between environmentalists' agendas and predicted the efforts would backfire.</p>
        <p>The Kyoto protocol may be only a beginning, Dr. Schneider said in exasperation. ''But it is an important first step. You've got to get started.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, a climate expert who is the senior scientist at Environmental Defense, said that in disagreeing among themselves environmentalists might have squandered a valuable opportunity to make progress on climate change. If the White House is won by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who opposes the Kyoto treaty as unfair to the United States, it will only get harder to find consensus between Europe and the United States, Dr. Oppenheimer said.</p>
        <p>He said it was important for European and American negotiators to talk frequently between now and the next negotiating session, which is scheduled in May in Bonn.</p>
