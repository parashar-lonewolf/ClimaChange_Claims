        <p>Seven months after first promising to come forward with a plan to look into the causes of global warming, the Bush administration introduced a comprehensive program today to coordinate current efforts studying climate change -- and develop some new ones -- across some 13 federal agencies.</p>
        <p>The plan was presented at a news conference by Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans and Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham. Among its provisions was $103 million to be spent to deploy new satellite-based global observation technologies.</p>
        <p>Officials did not identify how any of the program would be financed, however, bringing concern from scientists that any new initiatives would simply draw resources away from existing research efforts.</p>
        <p>Further, environmental advocacy groups criticized the effort as an administration delaying tactic to focus on uncertainties rather than the scientific consensus that has already emerged about how human activity contributes to global warming.</p>
        <p>''The administration wants to call a lot of attention to its research plan, because it wants to distract attention from its failure to have a global warming and pollution reduction plan,'' said Daniel A. Lashof, a senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council.</p>
        <p>Mr. Evans and Mr. Abraham, on the other hand, emphasized the importance of ''sound science'' in making decisions about climate change.</p>
        <p>''When it comes to global climate change, America is leading,'' said Mr. Evans, noting that the United States spent more on climate change research than Japan and Europe combined.</p>
        <p>He said the federal government was spending $4.5 billion on climate change efforts, although that figure included financing for marginally related things, like a substantial amount in tax breaks that are given to business and agriculture for energy efficiency initiatives and the like.</p>
        <p>Of the $4.5 billion figure, the budget for the Climate Change Science Program, which oversees the government's climate research, is about $1.7 billion. Budgets for the various research efforts on climate change are scheduled to be either flat or reduced in the next fiscal year.</p>
