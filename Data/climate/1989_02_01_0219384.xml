        <p>LEAD: William K. Reilly, President Bush's choice to head the Environmental Protection Agency, signaled a sharp break with Reagan Administration policies today by saying he would propose legislation to reduce acid rain.</p>
        <p>William K. Reilly, President Bush's choice to head the Environmental Protection Agency, signaled a sharp break with Reagan Administration policies today by saying he would propose legislation to reduce acid rain.</p>
        <p>Answering questions at a hearing of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on his nomination, Mr. Reilly said the first item on his agenda was legislation to strengthen the Clean Air Act. He said a major component of that legislation would be a program for reducing acid precipitation caused by pollution from coal-burning power plants and other sources.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly said that members of the Bush transition staff and the agency's staff had been working out details of the legislation and that the bill would be ready to go to Congress within a few weeks. He said the bill would contain a specific goal for reducing the pollution caused by acid rain, a goal that he could not pinpoint because it was still being worked out by the staff. Cost of Plan Put at Billions</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly was not asked at the hearing how much such a program would cost, and he has declined to be interviewed on any subject until he is confirmed. Others have estimated, however, that many billions of dollars would have to be spent to achieve any significant reductions in the pollution responsible for acid rain.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly did say that one of the obstacles to the acid rain problem was the loss of jobs that might be inflicted on miners in coal fields where the coal has a high sulfur content.</p>
        <p>In its eight-year tenure, the Reagan Administration never proposed legislation to strengthen the Clean Air Act, contending that more research was required on the causes and effects of acid rain before action could be taken. Bush Pledge Is Recalled</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly noted that Mr. Bush said in his campaign that the time to study acid rain was over and the time to act had come. He also recalled that the Republican candidate had promised a program aimed at reducing that would produce substantial reductions in the pollution that causes acid rain.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly told the panel that he regards strong environmental protection and strong economic development as fully compatible.</p>
        <p>''The kind of economic growth we want is the kind that doesn't shorten our breath or our life,'' he said. ''It is the kind that can be sustained.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly, who would be the first professional conservationist appointed to head the E.P.A., said in his opening remarks to the committee, ''We must usher in a new era in the history of environmental policy, an era marked by reconciliation of interests, by imaginative solutions arrived at through cooperation and consensus, by the resolve to listen and work out our differences.''</p>
        <p>He said building such a consensus would be needed to resolve the deadlock over acid rain controls, which divides region from region in this country and is a source of friction between the United States and Canada.</p>
        <p>Much of the acid rain is produced by sulfur and nitrogen emissions from power plants and other industrial sources in the Middle West that change chemically as they are driven by the wind through the atmosphere, and fall to earth, often as far away as New England and eastern Canada, as acidic rain, snow, fog or dry particles.</p>
        <p>Several senators expressed concern that Mr. Reilly's predilection for negotiation and consensus would preclude strong enforcement of the environmental laws and punishment for those who violate the laws. Vow on Vigorous Policy</p>
        <p>But Mr. Reilly, who was president of the Conservation Foundation and the World Wildlife Fund, two leading environmental groups, said, ''I accept as my duty, first and foremost, to implement the environmental laws of this land as Congress has written them.'' He pledged ''vigorous and aggressive enforcement of the environmental laws'' and said he would meet soon with Attorney General Dick Thornburgh to plan more for more effective enforcement of the laws.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly also assured the panel that he intended to be a forceful advocate for the environment within the councils of the Bush Administration.</p>
        <p>He said that the President Bush had told him he would sit in on all Cabinet meetings at which environmental matters were discussed and that he would have full access to the Oval Office.</p>
        <p>Among the other significant points to emerge from the confirmation hearing were the following:</p>
        <p>* Mr. Reilly indicated that a decision would be forthcoming soon from the Administration to seek deeper and faster cuts in the global production and use of chlorofluorocarbons, widely used chemicals believed to be depleting the stratospheric ozone that shields the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. An international treaty requires that production of these chemicals be frozen at 1986 levels starting this year and that production and use be cut back by about 50 percent by the end of the century.</p>
        <p>* The rate at which the nation's toxic waste dumps are being cleaned up is ''disappointing,'' and Mr. Reilly said he would undertake a review within the agency to find ways to speed the effort significantly.</p>
        <p>* The protection of the nation's rapidly disappearing wetlands must be given a much higher priority.</p>
        <p>* Mr. Reilly said that the E.P.A. was responsible for seeing that the environmental impact of oil drilling within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was adequately analyzed and assessed.</p>
        <p>The committee is scheduled to vote on Thursday on Mr. Reilly's nomination, and, judging by the laudatory comments about the nominee today, he should be approved easily.  3 NOMINEES BACKED</p>
        <p>WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 (AP) - The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee voted today to recommend that Samuel K. Skinner, head of the Chicago area transit system, be confirmed as Secretary of Transportation, that Robert A. Mosbacher, a Texas oilman, as Secretary of Commerce and that Carla Hills, secretary of Housing and Urban Development during the Ford Administration, as special trade representative.</p>
        <p>Correction:  March 24, 1989, Friday, Late City Final Edition</p>
        <p>An article on Feb. 1 about the Environmental Protection Agency referred incorrectly to William K. Reilly, the agency's new Administrator.</p>
        <p>He is the second professional environmentalist to head the agency; Russell Train, who led the E.P.A. in the Ford Administration, spent part of his career running private conservation groups.</p>
