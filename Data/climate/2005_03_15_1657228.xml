        <p>Prof Paul R Ehrlich letter expands on Nicholas Kristof's March 12 column quoting Erlich's book The Population Bomb</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As Nicholas D. Kristof writes, I said in ''The Population Bomb'': ''The battle to feed all of humanity is over. Hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death.'' Indeed, the battle goes on, and we're still losing.</p>
        <p>Since ''The Population Bomb'' was written in 1968, conservatively 200 million people have starved to death. As the Food and Agriculture Organization's 2004 annual hunger report pointed out, hunger and malnutrition kill more than five million children every year.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As Nicholas D. Kristof writes, I said in ''The Population Bomb'': ''The battle to feed all of humanity is over. Hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death.'' Indeed, the battle goes on, and we're still losing.</p>
        <p>Since ''The Population Bomb'' was written in 1968, conservatively 200 million people have starved to death. As the Food and Agriculture Organization's 2004 annual hunger report pointed out, hunger and malnutrition kill more than five million children every year.</p>
        <p>Some alarms are indeed screeching and overdrawn, and a few are just wrong. But others (like rapid climate change, extinctions and the population-related increase in the likelihood of pandemics), as Mr. Kristof suggests, cloud civilization's future.</p>
        <p>Playing down the importance of irreversible threats to our life-support systems helps the Bush administration and Congress use inevitable uncertainty as an excuse to avoid taking action until it is too late.</p>
        <p>Paul R. Ehrlich  Stanford, Calif., March 12, 2005</p>
        <p>The writer is a professor of population studies at Stanford University.</p>
