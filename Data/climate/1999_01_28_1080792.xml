        <p>Banners welcoming King Hussein home still adorn the streets of this capital. Full-color posters depict a smiling, relaxed monarch, his arm slung over the shoulders of his brother, the Crown Prince.</p>
        <p>But after the Shakespearean machinations of the last eight days, the adornments seem to many Jordanians to be totems of a distant past.</p>
        <p>The Crown Prince, Hassan, has been replaced by his nephew, the King's eldest son. The King, battling cancer, has left the country in haste for treatment. The new heir, Abdullah, young and inexperienced, received well-wishers for the first time today, amid questions about what might happen next.</p>
        <p>''Our King is a magnificent man, and now we don't know if he will ever come back,'' said Tarek Bourghol, a 23-year-old merchant. He was among countless Jordanians who watched as the new Crown Prince made his debut in a ceremony that was broadcast live on Jordanian television.</p>
        <p>The doctors of the King confirmed suspicions tonight that he had suffered a relapse of cancer, saying he had been readmitted to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., for treatment of non-Hodgkins lymphoma. A statement broadcast on state television here said the King was in stable condition.</p>
        <p>To counter the impression of sickness and strife, the Hashemite royal family has sought to display resilience. Prince Hassan, said to be bitterly disappointed by his ouster after 34 years as heir to the throne, joined the line of dignitaries paying tribute to the successor today. In the traditional Arab style, they bestowed a kiss on one cheek and then on the other.</p>
        <p>Crown Prince Abdullah, wearing a blue business suit and standing near a gold-rimmed throne, assured the dignitaries one by one that his father, the King, was still in good shape.</p>
        <p>A letter from the King has expressed ''categorical confidence and trust'' in his eldest son.</p>
        <p>But in private, and sometimes even in public, Jordanians are saying that what is taking place strikes them as not just drama but perhaps even tragedy in the kingdom.</p>
        <p>''Now it seems that the King is very sick, and the present and the future seem less defined than in the past,'' said Radwan Abdullah, a political scientist and consultant. ''This is bound to lead to insecurity and apprehension.''</p>
        <p>The most gnawing concern voiced by Jordanians today was for the 63-year-old King, who has ruled this kingdom since he was 17. Most Jordanians have known no other King, and many say they cannot imagine how anyone could replace him.</p>
        <p>The new worries over how much longer the King might reign have also sharpened what many Jordanians still describe as bafflement and disbelief over his abrupt change of  successors. Some say they find it hard to understand his decision, carried out in the space of a week, apparently with the knowledge that he was still ill, to wrest the title of Crown Prince from an experienced statesman and hand it to a 36-year-old career soldier who has never had a political role.</p>
        <p>''We lost the only Hashemite with experience, knowledge, maturity, intelligence, connections and seriousness,'' said a member of a prominent Jordanian family in reference to the ouster of Prince Hassan, 51. ''And we replaced him with a zero as far as most people are concerned. Prince Abdullah might be a nice guy, but he has no experience, no education, no seriousness.''</p>
        <p>Like most people critical of the King's decision, he agreed to be quoted only on the condition that his name not be used. But he and the others said they were speaking frankly because of real unease, and a feeling that Prince Abdullah might not be well suited to guide Jordan in an unsettled region.</p>
        <p>The King, on his return last week from six months of cancer treatment in the United States, said he was determined ''to make people more confident and more comfortable about their future'' after years clouded by economic problems and troubles across the Israeli and Iraqi borders.</p>
        <p>But what he set in motion in his week at home has only compounded insecurities. The steps included his abrupt removal of Prince Hassan, to whom he had referred for years as ''the apple of my eye,'' then the bitter letter that all but accused his brother of treachery, and finally his own sudden departure.</p>
        <p>''This has all been very strange, but we have to hope that somehow all of this will lead to a change for the better,'' said Samr Khayat, 27, a cook who was grilling lamb on an outdoor stove.</p>
        <p>For some people, the King's success at steering Jordan through nearly five decades of turbulence in the Middle East has forged a faith that even if what he is doing seems hard to understand, it might well be right.</p>
        <p>As Joumana Nuqul, 35, a travel agent, put it in a conversation today, ''In a phrase, I think the King knows what he is doing.''</p>
        <p>Fahd Fanek, a Jordanian columnist, argued in the newspaper Al Rai on Tuesday that such sentiments meant that any discontent over Prince Hassan's ouster would ultimately fade away.</p>
        <p>''Nobody can cast any doubt on Prince Hassan, his ability and his experience during 34 years in office,'' Mr. Fanek wrote. But he added, ''Popular trust in King Hussein is considerable, and the Jordanian people happily accept any decision he takes.''</p>
        <p>Other Jordanians, however, say they wonder whether illness might have robbed the King of some of his judgment. As possible evidence, they have pointed with some amazement to the King's letter to Prince Hassan, dated Jan. 25 and made public early Tuesday. In translation from the Arabic, it runs to six single-spaced pages, and in a departure from the King's usual eloquence, it is rambling and barely coherent in some sections.</p>
        <p>From its main point -- the reasons for his brother's ouster -- the letter veers into soliloquies on germ warfare and the ozone layer. Elsewhere it abandons its tone of royal reserve, even suggesting that the King and his family ''were hurt by the gossip and lies about my wife and children'' that he said had been spread by Prince Hassan's supporters.</p>
