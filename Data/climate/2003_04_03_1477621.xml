        <p>The Mystery of Ant Lovers</p>
        <p>Q. My daughter gave us a vining plant labeled Dischidia pectinoides, potted in orchid-type bark mix. Could you explain the function of the inflated pods at the base of the plant, and how to care for a Dischidia?</p>
        <p>A. Your new friend belongs to a small group of plants known to botanists as myrmecophilous, or ant loving. The inflated pods are actually modified leaves, designed to provide cozy homes for ants to raise their young. The ants in turn give off carbon dioxide and deposit waste products, providing nutrients that are absorbed by the leaves.</p>

        <p>The Mystery of Ant Lovers</p>
        <p>Q. My daughter gave us a vining plant labeled Dischidia pectinoides, potted in orchid-type bark mix. Could you explain the function of the inflated pods at the base of the plant, and how to care for a Dischidia?</p>
        <p>A. Your new friend belongs to a small group of plants known to botanists as myrmecophilous, or ant loving. The inflated pods are actually modified leaves, designed to provide cozy homes for ants to raise their young. The ants in turn give off carbon dioxide and deposit waste products, providing nutrients that are absorbed by the leaves.</p>
        <p>Dischidias are epiphytes, or tree-perchers, like many orchids, and need a well-drained growing medium (hence the bark mix). They come from Western Asia and the Western Pacific, so you could not fix them up with the right ants even if you wanted to. But feeding them through their leaves is easy. Just use commercial foliar fertilizer in spring and summer, when they are in active growth.</p>
        <p>That is also the time to keep the soil constantly moist. In winter, let it dry out a bit. They like a humid atmosphere, warmth, a crowded pot and a small trellis to climb. If they get all those things and ample bright, indirect light, they will put out small red flowers intermittently year-round. Sources for dischidias include Glasshouse Works, (740) 662-2142 or www.glasshouseworks.com; and Tropiflora, (941) 351-2267 or www.tropiflora.com.</p>
        <p>Sweet to Look At, Not to Eat</p>
        <p>Q. I believe those bright lime-green vines seen about town in container plantings are sweet potatoes. Can regular grocery store sweet potatoes be planted, or are they a specific potato from some other vendor?</p>
        <p>A. Those lime-green vines are indeed Ipomoea batatas, the same species as grocery store sweet potatoes, but they are an ornamental variety that does not form large, edible tubers.</p>
        <p>You could get vines from edible sweet potatoes but they would not be nearly as decorative as the ornamental kind, which are also available in purple, or with variegated leaves that have white and pink streaks.</p>
        <p>Ornamental sweet potatoes are propagated from rooted cuttings and are usually sold as small plants. They used to be specialty items but are now almost as common as marigolds. Look for them at any well-stocked garden center, as soon as the danger of frost is past.</p>
        <p>Rescuing Peonies</p>
        <p>Q. I know you are supposed to transplant peonies in the fall, but we have some large, fine old bush varieties that must be moved this spring to make room for a new driveway. Can we save these plants?</p>
        <p>A. Sure. Salvation is mostly a matter of starting early, ideally before active growth begins accelerating.</p>
        <p>Choose new planting spots that get sun for at least half the day and dig the holes before you start digging up the plants. Holes should be about 14 inches deep and 3 feet wide: the roots of old garden peonies tend to be very long and to spread horizontally.</p>
        <p>At this point, each plant probably looks like a tight clump of shoots. Assume the shoots are at the center of a 30-inch circle. Thoroughly loosen the circle with a digging fork, then work the fork a foot below the shoots and lift the plant. Replant it no deeper than it was before. Water well, but do not fertilize until new growth is well established.</p>
        <p>Moving may set the plants back for a while, but peonies are tough. By next year or the year after they should be fine once more.</p>
        <p>Garden Q &amp; A  Correction:  May 29, 2003, Thursday  A report in the Garden Q.&amp;A. column on April 3 about ornamental sweet potato vines referred imprecisely to one of their growth habits. While they can indeed form large, edible tubers, that seldom occurs in the small containers in which they are usually grown. Two readers notified The Times on April 4 about the error; this correction was delayed by an editing lapse.</p>
