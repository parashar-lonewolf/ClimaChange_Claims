        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Most of us, and our children, will be alive when the oil-age comes to an end; known reserves of oil will mostly be gone in 30 to 40 years. Instead of fighting wars for the dwindling and ever-more-precious reserves, can we develop solar power and other renewable energy sources to replace the oil we burn so rapidly?</p>
        <p>Each year about 25 barrels of oil are consumed per person in the United States, the highest consumption rate in the world. Even so, if we covered an area equal to our rooftops with solar panels, we could collect solar energy that far exceeded this as a power source. Put another way, an area on the order of 150 miles square, a small dot on the globe, could collect more solar power than the entire worldwide consumption of oil provides. To manufacture and install solar collectors, and devise ways to store and distribute power, will cost billions -- but so will war.</p>
        <p>The sooner we shift our goals away from oil, and war, the sooner we will develop solar power, wind power and other sources of renewable energy that do not pollute our air, nor accelerate the greenhouse effect, nor contaminate our ground water and our oceans. Solar power is abundantly available to every country on earth, and it is renewable sources of energy, not oil, that will empower the new world order. RICHARD A. CONE Professor of Biophysics Johns Hopkins University Baltimore, Jan. 14, 1991</p>
