        <p>''Raw Nerves on Fire Island'' might leave some readers with the impression that the battles over such issues as beach replenishment are between Fire Islanders and outside environmental organizations. It could be more accurately described as a contest between lovers of the National Seashore, on the one hand, and on the other hand commercial and real estate interests who view it as a place to make money.</p>
        <p>Many of us homeowners are happy to live in a national park and freely accept the attendant risks and responsibilities. We realize that a barrier island made of sand is inherently unstable, and count on flood insurance to bail us out if we are unlucky. Beyond that, we do not expect the taxpayers to preserve our investment.</p>

We realize that a barrier island made of sand is inherently unstable, and count on flood insurance to bail us out if we are unlucky. Beyond that, we do not expect the taxpayers to preserve our investment.</p>
        <p>As for beach replenishment, in the grand scheme of things it is irrelevant. No matter what the government does, nothing will challenge the centuries-old reality (now exacerbated by global warming) that the island is gradually moving northward, and those who build or buy homes on the southern edge have no one to blame but themselves. We should all calm our nerves and simply enjoy (rather than try to control) this fabulous natural environment.</p>
