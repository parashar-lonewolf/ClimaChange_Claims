        <p>IN the middle of the Bronx, buffeted and poisoned by the worst environmental insults that urban America can dish out, stands one of the last remnants of the lush forest that once covered New York City: 40 acres of hardwoods and hemlocks contained within the public grounds of the New York Botanical Garden.</p>
        <p>If any patch of old-growth woodlands was going to sicken and succumb to urban stress, this would be it. But ecologists, who have belatedly begun to study urban and suburban ecosystems, have found, to their surprise, that naturally occurring city forests -- there are 6,000 acres of them in New York City alone -- are adapting in unsuspected ways and appear healthier than might be expected. In fact, they say, the woodlands of the inner cities seem to be performing ecological functions as efficiently as do forests in the more salubrious suburbs, and may even be retaining more of their original character.</p>
        <p>Nitrogen emitted by the clanking, fuel-burning metropolis appears to be acting as a fertilizer, spurring soil microbes to break down plant litter more rapidly. The scientists believe this is enriching the trees' diet and boosting their growth. At the same time, because the urban woodlands are islands in a sea of concrete, they may be better protected than the suburbs from invasion by the many exotic species of trees and plants introduced from other countries over past decades. These have especially changed the composition of suburban woodlands.</p>
        <p>But the city forest has not remained pristine. Researchers have found evidence of major historical changes in the 40 acres of old growth in the Botanical Gardens. Human disturbance has caused the big hemlocks and oaks that once dominated the forest to decline in numbers, allowing smaller, more opportunistic species of native trees like black birch, black cherry and red maple to luxuriate and spread.</p>
        <p>Nor is there room for complacency about the urban woodlands' long-term health. Assaulted by acid rain, ozone, toxic metals, arson and other abuse at human hands, the trees are dying at more than twice the natural rate. And the same fertilization processes that now enrich the urban forests could kill them in time, some ecologists speculate.</p>
        <p>But for now, "they are still alive and still perpetuating themselves; we should give them a hand of applause," said Dr. Mark J. McDonnell, an ecologist at the Botanical Garden's Institute of Ecosystem Studies at Millbrook, N.Y. He is one of a handful of scientists who have lately begun looking into urban ecology. Urban forests seem "fairly tough and adaptable," he said. "They don't seem to be limping along like an unhealthy person. They're cranking away." Dr. McDonnell reported on the early findings of a long-term study of the Botanical Garden forest at a recent symposium on Northeastern forests at the Bronx institution.</p>
        <p>In the past, many ecologists have considered urban and suburban ecosystems as somehow unnatural and therefore not fit subjects of study. Scientists "avoided systems where people lived or that were manipulated by humans," said Dr. Steward T. A. Pickett, another ecologist at the Botanical Garden who also spoke at the symposium. The reason, he said, is that ecology was dominated by a world view in which humans and nature are separate. In this view, nature exists in a harmonious balance that humans disturb. But an emerging new paradigm sees humans as an integral part of nature, and nature itself as being not in balance but in continual flux. Humans, in the new paradigm, are just one of many forces contributing to the flux.</p>
        <p>Because of adherence to the traditional view, says Dr. McDonnell, "we know more about the tops of mountains than we know about the forests in New York City." Now, as the new paradigm begins to take hold, that is starting to change, and the larger forest ecosystems scattered about New York and other cities -- as distinguished from street trees -- are only now beginning to yield some of their ecological secrets.</p>
        <p>Actually, the present-day environmental stresses and strains visited on the forests of the Northeast, the most urbanized part of North America, are only the latest in a long series of large-scale disruptions caused by humans and other natural forces. The other forces include storms, fires and hurricanes and, 20,000 to 10,000 years ago, the movement of great ice sheets that first destroyed the forests and then withdrew to allow them to re-assemble.</p>
        <p>Perhaps as far back as 9,000 years ago, native Americans were revamping the forests on a significant scale. The Indians would set fire to the forest in spring and fall to make it more passable and hunting easier, Dr. William A. Niering, an ecologist at Connecticut College, told the recent symposium. The result was large stretches of "open, park-like forest."</p>
        <p>To create agricultural fields and other clearings, European settlers and their descendants stripped 50 to 70 percent of some Northeastern areas of all their trees. Over many decades, they converted much of the region from a forest ecosystem to an "agro-ecosystem." These highly disrupted ecosystems began to revert to second-growth forest as early as the 1850's, as settlers moved West and abandoned their farms. Many varieties of exotic plants were introduced from abroad, both accidentally and by design, and they frequently escaped into the wild, where they are still changing the composition and character of the woodlands. The Ideal Laboratory</p>
        <p>More recently, modern development has fragmented the recovering forests, reducing their capacity to support wildlife. Fragmentation increases the area of "edge" forest, the part of the woods next to a cleared space, where more sunlight comes into play and the mixture of tree and plant species changes. The edge becomes inhospitable to animal species that live in the interior of the forest.</p>
        <p>As one indication of how prevalent fragmentation has become, Dr. McDonnell cited a study showing that 71 percent of the forest in the rural New Jersey highlands consists of patches smaller than 50 acres.</p>
        <p>Humans, in short, have created a semi-cultural, semi-natural landscape that is continually changing and evolving, said Dr. McDonnell. The task for urban ecologists, he said, is to try to find out where this landscape is heading.</p>
        <p>As one part of the effort, he and his colleagues have studied forests along an 87-mile corridor extending northeastward from the Bronx into Dutchess County, N.Y., and Litchfield County, Conn. In early results, they have documented a gradual increase in environmental pollution and ecological damage as one moves toward the city.</p>
        <p>Near the end of that gradient is the Botanical Gardens forest. The forest has never been cut. But otherwise, it has been exposed to the full force of urban environmental stress, making it an ideal laboratory in which to study the effects of that stress.</p>
        <p>Among the stresses are deposits of acid, apparently from acid rain, and of heavy metals like lead, nickel and copper, and disruption of the forest by arson, trampling and vandalism. The researchers have found that the soils of the forest, for reasons they do not yet know, tend to repel water. Over the decades, people have used the forest as a campground and have even washed their clothes in the Bronx River and hung them to dry in the forest. Fires are still frequently set.</p>
        <p>The researchers have also discovered that 2.5 to 5 percent of trees in urban areas die every year, compared with a little less than 1 percent for rural areas. Between 1935 and 1975, they found, a combination of human-induced stresses and natural events like storms caused the death of 60 to 70 percent of the very large hemlocks and oaks that dominated the forest canopy. They have been largely replaced by the birch-cherry-maple forest that has now become dominant. 'This Soup of Nitrogen'</p>
        <p>"I don't think that's bad," said Dr. McDonnell. "I think it's terrific, because the forest is regenerating itself with native trees. In the past, I think we've written off a lot of urban and suburban forests as artificial systems, barely functioning, requiring a lot of management just to survive.</p>
        <p>"But our findings suggest they have compensated," he added, "that the ecosystem has adapted. It has surprised us in its resilience."</p>
        <p>One reason may be "this soup of nitrogen," as Dr. McDonnell calls it, that has descended on the forest. He speculates that it is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels by automobiles, trucks, power plants and other industrial sources.</p>
        <p>The excess nitrogen, he believes, has caused a speedup in the process by which dead leaves and other plant litter decompose into food useful to the trees. This extra nourishment may be what is enabling the forest to remain viable, he said. But extra nourishment may also mean that the trees will not be required to put out as many of the fine roots they use to obtain nutrients and water. If a severe drought should come, this could threaten the trees' existence.</p>
        <p>"This might be more detrimental to the trees than acid rain in the long run," he said. "Down the road, it might do them in." As a result of this heretofore unsuspected threat, he said, "it is possible that we could wake up in five years and find them dead -- not because of obviously toxic pollutants but because we overfertilized them."</p>
