        <p>When President Reagan was first elected in 1980, the Heritage Foundation had waiting for him a long agenda of actions he could take in dealing with environmental problems. The recommendations reflected the foundation's conservative perspective. National environmental groups, whose views were generally in direct opposition to those of the foundation, wrung their hands.</p>
        <p>The environmentalists have determined not to leave another such vacuum for the next President, Republican or Democrat. Most of the major environmental groups have joined to produce a ''Blueprint for the Environment,'' which will formulate recommendations on the widest possible range of environmental issues. The issues covered by the blueprint will range from global warming and depletion of the ozone layer, to the loss of tropical forests, safe drinking water, loss of wildlife and nuclear power. Clay Peters, executive director of the project, said, ''We feel the case we will present will be so convincing that it cannot be dismissed by any new President who is concerned about the future of our nation and its quality of life.''</p>
