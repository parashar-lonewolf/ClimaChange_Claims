        <p>IF Michael Moore wrote an episode of ''The Twilight Zone,'' it might look something like the new drama ''Chinese Friends.'' Set in 2030, Jon Robin Baitz's play, which opened on Thursday at Playwrights Horizons, imagines disastrous consequences for the United States as a result of the policies of the Bush administration.

        <p>IF Michael Moore wrote an episode of ''The Twilight Zone,'' it might look something like the new drama ''Chinese Friends.'' Set in 2030, Jon Robin Baitz's play, which opened on Thursday at Playwrights Horizons, imagines disastrous consequences for the United States as a result of the policies of the Bush administration. Mr. Baitz, known for morally complex works like ''The Substance of Fire,'' says it is his first play written out of ''repulsion.''</p>
        <p>It begins with America in chaos -- politically isolated, economically ruined and wracked by anarchy. ''It's like one of those apocalyptic movies on Channel 11 that you watch on a hot day, like 'Soylent Green' or 'The Omega Man,' '' Mr. Baitz said by phone.</p>
        <p>The disaster scenario emerged out of the failure of conservative economic policy and American imperialism. ''In the cosmology of the play,'' Mr. Baitz said, ''U.S. defense spending keeps increasing, the deficit balloons, jobs continue going overseas and less and less is spent on education, creating a surge of bewildered and undereducated children let loose on a collapsing America. Arguably, it's exaggerated, but these conditions do exist.''</p>
        <p>''Chinese Friends'' is as much about disappointment with what Mr. Baitz sees as the listless left as it is about disdain for the radical right. The excerpt below, taken from early in the play, is a conversation between Arthur and Ajax Brice, who represent two kinds of backlash against the conservative ruling class.</p>
        <p>Arthur Brice, the father, is a former political operative who worked in a left-wing administration soon after President George W. Bush was out of power. Brice senior was part of a radical group, called the killer humanists, born out of frustration with the caution of the Democratic Party. While in power from 2008 to 2012, they started rolling back the gains of the far right, using methods that could be extreme and sometimes brutal. ''Arthur Brice is a Wolfowitz of the left,'' Mr. Baitz said, referring to the deputy defense secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz. ''Now what would that look like?''</p>
        <p>His son, Ajax, dislikes all politicians and belongs to a cultlike commune. ''He is a product of war, a wounded and confused child,'' Mr. Baitz said.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to write a jeremiad,'' he added. ''How treasonous this administration is just overtook me.''</p>
        <p>JASON ZINOMAN</p>
        <p>AJAX: I hate to break it to you, but your old gang -- ''killer humanists'' -- I believe you were called -- you think that this country would have you back.  BRICE: Excuse me, the United Nations has collapsed, Social Security is gone, people are fighting wars over clean water. When we were in office, we warned that in 20 years this country would be made marginal in terms of world markets. We predicted China. We predicted the European alliances -- Anglo, Franco, German, Russian.  AJAX: Dr. Brice, nobody listened to you. You were totally ineffective. And look what has happened to us. The dynasty of cowboys and corporate criminals . . .  BRICE: Have reduced the only great experiment in democracy to a nation bordering on medieval backwardness. This country will have me back and will welcome me with open arms.  AJAX: There's no real difference between your guys and the people in charge now.  BRICE: They are weak. We are not.  AJAX: Weak? These people are not weak.  BRICE: Martial strength is not true strength. Real strength is respecting the hearts and minds and differences of other cultures. Real strength is being brave enough to collaborate on new technologies and share control. It's never using concepts like crusade and evil to describe the other. Ajax, you can't possibly believe that going to war for fossil fuels and market pockets is strong. You're right, only the weak believe their god is the only god. Only the weak believe in isolationism and have xenophobic passion for national borders.  AJAX: I wish I could get behind all this. But I have no politics. They've always led to such disappointment.  BRICE: Are you insane? Look at you -- in rags and smoking pot and crack and heroin and shooting up and living in filth, a cultist: that's political. That's the politics of nihilism and letting it all pass by. Leave these people. Spend some time with me. Don't be brainwashed . . . into never trusting anything.</p>
