        <p>LEAD: Brazil owes the world $115 billion. The world wants Brazil to stop recklessly destroying the Amazon rain forest, an extraordinary natural wonder. Those two conditions invite a deal, a grand debt-for-nature swap that would ease Brazil's burden of foreign borrowing and preserve the Amazon forests. What stands in the way of so compelling a solution?</p>
        <p>Brazil owes the world $115 billion. The world wants Brazil to stop recklessly destroying the Amazon rain forest, an extraordinary natural wonder. Those two conditions invite a deal, a grand debt-for-nature swap that would ease Brazil's burden of foreign borrowing and preserve the Amazon forests. What stands in the way of so compelling a solution? Brazil's President, Jose Sarney, for one thing. Last month his Foreign Minister, Roberto de Abreu Sodre, received an American delegation that included Thomas Lovejoy, a tropical biologist, and Senators Tim Wirth, Albert Gore and John Heinz. Mr. Sodre enthusiastically endorsed the idea of a Brazilian foundation to administer a debt-for-nature swap. But when the group reached the presidential palace, Mr. Sarney rejected the idea as foreign interference. ''We don't want the Amazon to become a green Persian Gulf,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sarney's notion of foreigners taking possession of the Amazon is a groundless fear concocted by his military advisers. His nonchalance toward the state of the forests does not accord with his own Government's data. Amazonia is fast being torched by landless settlers. The province of Rondonia, which holds one of the world's richest ecosystems, is already 17 percent deforested.</p>
        <p>The destruction is a bitter waste because the forest soil is for the most part too poor for farming. The settlers raise a few years' crops and then move on. Even cattle ranches are uneconomic and survive only through Government subsidies.</p>
        <p>Loss of the forests destroys both their Amerindian inhabitants and the livelihood of the rubber-tree tappers, who exploit the forest without destroying it. Last December the leader of the rubber tappers' union, Francisco Mendes Filho, was murdered after he campaigned to protect the rain forest from settlers' bulldozers. Despite death threats, the Government failed to protect him.</p>
        <p>How can Brazil's forests and their rich dowry of rare plants and animals be saved? The means are at hand in Brazil's debt. Suppose donors in the West could raise $4 billion to save the Amazonian rain forests. They would then buy discounted Brazilian debt with a face value of, say, $8 billion. That debt, denominated in dollars, is exchanged in Brazil for bonds worth $8 billion in local currency. The bonds are then donated to endow a Brazilian environmental institute charged with protecting the rain forest.</p>
        <p>Everyone would benefit because (a) the institute gets generous income from the interest and principal paid on the debt; (b) the Brazilian Government gets to pay off its debt in local currency instead of in scarce foreign exchange; (c) Brazil can then afford more imports from the donor countries; (d) creditor banks are relieved of dubious loans, and (e) an irreplaceable rain forest is saved for future generations.</p>
        <p>It's as much in the West's interest to help Brazil save Amazonia as it is in Brazil's. The forests are ancient nurseries of life where evolution has progressed for eons, uninterrupted by the ice ages that have periodically wiped out most species in temperate latitudes. The extensive burning of Amazonia adds greatly to the burden of carbon dioxide, cause of the feared greenhouse warming of the earth's atmosphere. Because aid can be so highly leveraged through debt exchange, the forests are cheap to save.</p>
        <p>As for Brazil, it would lighten its foreign debt burden by helping to save its own natural heritage. The clearer view of Brazilian interests comes from Mr. Sarney's Foreign Minister, not his generals.</p>
