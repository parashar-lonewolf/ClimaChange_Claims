        <p>NEW genetic research has produced more evidence that the first people to settle America probably arrived from Asia as early as 29,000 years ago.

        <p>NEW genetic research has produced more evidence that the first people to settle America probably arrived from Asia as early as 29,000 years ago. The findings provide ammunition for escalating attacks on the traditional hypothesis holding that the migrations occurred about 12,000 years ago.</p>
        <p>In a study of linguistically related Indians in Central America, the researchers developed an evolutionary time clock that they said should be more accurate than any in current use. Applied to 18 other widely dispersed Indian groups, the clock showed that their common ancestors must have reached America 22,000 to 29,000 years ago. After scattering, they began evolving their present degree of genetic diversity, the researchers said.</p>
        <p>The results are being reported today in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by a research team led by Dr. Antonio Torroni, a geneticist at Emory University in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>Such genetic reconstructions of evolutionary patterns are controversial, and the scientists acknowledged that the migration estimate "carries a large but indeterminate error." Still, they concluded that the results favored an earlier-entry hypothesis for the initial American settlement. Confidence in Findings</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview, Dr. Torroni gave a less equivocal interpretation. "We believe in our data," he said. "I feel that they strongly push for an early arrival of people in the Americas."</p>
        <p>Archeologists agreed that the finding were powerful circumstantial evidence for earlier migrations. They noted that their excavations were turning up more clues of human occupation well before 12,000 years ago. But these results have yet to be accepted as authentic.</p>
        <p>"It's fascinating stuff," Dr. David Meltzer, an archeologist at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, said of the new genetic research. "Ultimately, though, the solution is going to have to come from archeology. You can't date a gene like a piece of charcoal. Mutation rates change."</p>
        <p>Dr. Torroni's team derived a rate of genetic mutation change from a study of seven modern Indian tribes in Central America, all of which speak the Chibcha language. From linguistic and archeological evidence, it is estimated that the tribes formed a single genetic group 8,000 to 10,000 years ago and then began to diverge.</p>
        <p>By analyzing samples of mitochondrial DNA, a fast-evolving genetic component of the cell, in the modern Chibcha-speaking people, Dr. Torroni determined the telltale elements of their genetic diversity, presumably the result of their separation over 8,000 or more years. The scientists thus established the mutation rates over that period, which they then used to determine the genetic history of many other American Indians. 3 Major Indian Groups</p>
        <p>Based on linguistics, dental variation, blood groups and other traits, American Indians are classified into three major groups: Amerinds, who inhabit most of the Americas; Na-Dene in northwest North America, as well as the Navaho and Apache; and the Inuit, or Eskimo, and Aleuts, who live mainly in the Arctic. Many scholars have assumed that these divisions represent the descendants of three different waves of migration.</p>
        <p>Dr. Torroni's research concerned only the Amerinds, the largest of the groups. If they entered the New World as a single group, the scientists concluded from the mutation rates, that entry occurred no later than 22,000 years ago and more likely 29,000 years ago.</p>
        <p>But another team of geneticists, led by Dr. Richard H. Ward of the University of Utah and Dr. Svante Paabo of the University of Munich, has produced findings that question the assumption that this genetic variability began after people crossed the land bridge in the Bering Sea, which existed when sea levels were much lower in the ice age. Some of the genetic separation might have begun back in Asia, they reported.</p>
        <p>In a commentary accompanying Dr. Torroni's report, Dr. Kenneth M. Weiss, an anthropologist specializing in genetic studies at Pennsylvania State University, said the new research showed "the potential of genetic methods to address prehistorical questions." But he cautioned that "genetics alone will not suffice" and that only "the combined application of all the anthropological sciences" could solve the mystery of the peopling of America.</p>
