        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''So let's tell both sides. The facts demand it. Reason dictates it. Earth deserves it.'' So ends a letter on carbon dioxide and global warming by Sherwood B. Idso (May 7), and I cannot agree more. But he did not tell both sides, or even acknowledge both sides, and I cannot let his letter go unanswered because it provides specious justification for those who support the current do-nothing Federal position on carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Idso first questions the validity of using glacial ice cores to show a causal relationship between carbon dioxide concentrations and global temperatures. His criticisms are valid. He then discusses the imprecision of the computer models used to predict global warming. He is right. He concludes that ''to base sweeping social changes on imperfect predictive tools is unwise and contrary to mainstream scientific thinking.''</p>
        <p>I disagree, on three counts: (1) Many proposed solutions, like increased energy efficiency, require no social change, use currently available technology and provide many additional benefits (e.g., reduced oil imports). (2) Although we are uncertain of the extent of warming-induced impacts, they are well known and potentially so massive that it is unwise to take the chance. After all, we have only one earth and no fallback position if the experiment fails. (3) There is no ''mainstream scientific thinking'' on this issue, but a continuum of viewpoints with significant numbers holding opposing views.</p>
        <p>The unforgivable portion of the letter, however, is a flight of fancy that starts with the known positive effect of carbon dioxide enrichment on plant growth in controlled experiments and ends with reduced soil erosion, more earthworms, a greater rate of soil formation, and higher soil fertility in a future carbon dioxide-enriched world. Does he indicate any uncertainty in these predictions? No: ''All of these good things will happen . . . It's one of the best things that could happen to the planet.'' He does stop short of advocating increased carbon dioxide emissions, but not by much. How does such unsubstantiated conjecture slip into a letter advocating greater scientific rigor?</p>
        <p>By ignoring potential climatic shifts and sea level changes, he dogmatically presents only the possible upside. The complexities of ecological interactions seem to have no place in his simplistic way of thinking.</p>
        <p>This is a serious problem to be faced soberly by all countries. Both sides must be examined objectively; we do not need gratuitous arguments to support the status quo. Such reasoning substantiates the widespread, appropriate belief that the arguments for action now outweigh those for staying the course.</p>
