        <p>LEAD: George Bush's campaign promise to pay more attention to the environment was welcome news after eight years of indifference from Ronald Reagan. He now faces a marvelous opportunity to match rhetoric with substance: the urgent need to revise the Clean Air Act of 1970, landmark legislation grown flaccid with age.</p>
        <p>George Bush's campaign promise to pay more attention to the environment was welcome news after eight years of indifference from Ronald Reagan. He now faces a marvelous opportunity to match rhetoric with substance: the urgent need to revise the Clean Air Act of 1970, landmark legislation grown flaccid with age.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has already listened to hours of conflicting advice. The forces arrayed against tightening the act are formidable. The President's forthcoming proposals will reveal much about his seriousness and also his political courage and ingenuity.</p>
        <p>The 1970 law was a monument, passed early in the new era of environmental consciousness. There's no question that it has curbed air pollution. But even as amended in 1977, the law ignores some problems and hasn't kept pace with others. Three of five Americans now live in more than 100 urban areas that fail to meet Federal air quality standards - despite annual spending of $35 billion, mostly by the private sector, to control pollution.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush will have to address three forms of air pollution: acid rain, smog and toxic chemicals. Toxic pollution, involving some 300 different chemicals, is the most complex. The health hazards are difficult to measure. Mr. Bush may not be able to do more than urge a tightening of existing laws. But there's much he can do on the other fronts.</p>
        <p>Acid Rain. The chief cause is the 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide that are emitted each year from smokestacks of coal-fired power plants in the Middle West. Utilities, citing costs, and high-sulfur-coal interests, citing possible job losses, have long opposed strict controls. For President Bush, the acid test on acid rain will be whether he can ignore the lobbyists and support his Environmental Protection Agency's Administrator, William Reilly, who recommends a 50 percent cut in sulfur dioxide emissions by the turn of the century.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly's plan would set emission limits and let utilities decide how to meet them. They could invest in scrubbers to clean the emissions, switch to low-sulfur coal or use various exotic market incentives. These solutions won't be cheap. But they're sensible, and long overdue. Smog Standards. About half the chemicals that contribute to smog come from stationary sources -backyard barbecues, dry cleaners, giant petrochemical plants. These can't easily be controlled from Washington. The trick will be to induce states to control them without relinquishing Federal oversight. And that means a new set of realistic but enforceable standards requiring states to show year-to-year improvements.</p>
        <p>The other half of the smog problem is caused by cars and trucks. There's nothing good to be said for the hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides that flow from the nation's 100 million tailpipes. They play a malignant role in urban pollution. And nitrogen oxides add significantly to acid rain. This means that if Mr. Bush is really serious about clean air, he'll have to tackle the automobile and oil industries.</p>
        <p>A two-stage response, supported by Mr. Reilly and Boyden Gray, the White House counsel, is now on Mr. Bush's desk. Stage one would rely on improvements in existing technology to make all cars and light trucks comply with the emission controls that California will require by 1993.</p>
        <p>As more people drive more miles, however, the benefits from existing technology will dwindle. Thus the second stage would nudge the oil and automobile companies toward alternative fuels. Though such fuels may pose new problems, one of them, natural-gas-based methanol, could cut existing harmful tailpipe emissions by an astounding 80 percent.</p>
        <p>Both the oil and auto industries are howling. Why develop a car for which there is no readily available fuel? Why develop fuels for which there is no car? But they made the same complaints when Congress told them to develop unleaded fuel and cars that could run on it. Unleaded fuel is now the norm.</p>
        <p>Special interest groups aside, the political climate seems hospitable to tougher laws. Environmental issues enjoy new popularity. The new Senate majority leader, George Mitchell, is a strong proponent of cleaner air; his predecessor was not. The missing ingredient for a decade is something George Bush can now supply: leadership from the White House.</p>
