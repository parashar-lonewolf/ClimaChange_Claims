        <p>Five years of experimenting with fuel cells to determine their reliability and compatibility with Long Island's electric grid ended Tuesday when the Long Island Power Authority said it was ready to accept proposals to build and operate the most powerful fuel cell in the country.</p>
        <p>LIPA said the fuel cell, which would be about the size of a refrigerator and would be built at its West Babylon substation, would have to be able to produce 10 megawatts of electricity, enough to power about 10,000 homes. LIPA wants it up and running by the summer of 2006. The fuel cell would be powered by natural gas but eventually could run on hydrogen.</p>
        <p>The experiments with fuel cells were part of LIPA's 10-year, $355-million Clean Energy Initiative established in 1998 to develop and use alternative and renewable energy sources.</p>
        <p>Michael Lowndes, LIPA's director of media relations, said that a fuel cell of this capacity had never been built before in the United States but that the technology had proven itself in the last five years. During that time, he said, fuel cells scattered throughout the Island have produced 2.5 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, enough to power about 270 homes for one year.</p>
        <p>''When we embarked on the program five years ago,'' Mr. Lowndes said, ''one of the first demonstration projects was at Brookhaven National Laboratory, and that one fuel cell filled an entire room. Now a fuel cell is the size of a refrigerator.''</p>
