        <p>Trash incinerators are unpopular with their neighbors, but the main alternatives also have drawbacks: landfills can pollute groundwater, and they are filling up rapidly, and recycling is cumbersome and often expensive. So what is a sanitation department to do?</p>
        <p>New York City, among other options, is looking at a technology that a small Italian concern is promoting in Europe and the United States. The process involves shredding garbage, heating it and pressing it into ice-cube-sized bricks, and then steaming the bricks until they emit a gas that can be burned to make electricity. Along with electricity, the process produces an ash with 15 to 20 percent of the volume of the original garbage.</p>
        <p>Ash from trash, of course, involves its own set of environmental burdens, and the Supreme Court ruled earlier this week that it was covered by the same hazardous waste rules governing disposal of other industrial materials. But in the future, it may be far easier to find a place to store 15 pounds of ash than 100 pounds of trash, and the exhaust from the Italian method may be cleaner than that from conventional incinerators. Neighbors Oppose Incinerators</p>
        <p>New York City, which has filled every landfill but one, is trying to build an incinerator at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, over the determined opposition of people who live nearby. It is also considering several proposals for gasifiers, according to Paul J. Bekowies, a research scientist at the city's Department of Sanitation who worked in the 1970's on a United States Department of Energy project on gasification.</p>
        <p>One proposal before Mr. Bekowies is from an Italian engineer in New York, Roberto Rovere, representing Grillenzoni &amp; Associates of Modena, Italy, which provided designs and engineering for two gasifiers built in recent years in Italy.</p>
        <p>Gasification involves heating a substance in the presence of steam and a controlled amount of oxygen to produce fuel gas. Before the completion of natural gas pipelines after World War II, utilities gasified coal to supply a flammable gas to homes and street lamps. And today some companies gasify heavy oil; others are trying to gasify tougher substances, like tires that have been cooked in an oil stew to prepare for gasification. Tree Gasification Proposed</p>
        <p>Some environmentalists have proposed large-scale gasification of trees or crop wastes for electric power. That would not contribute to global warming, because cutting down a tree or a plant makes room for a new one to grow, absorbing as much carbon dioxide as the first one had. But very few engineers have tried using garbage as a gas feedstock.</p>
        <p>In general, gasification is cleaner than burning, because sulfur, acids, and other pollutants can be cleaned out of the gas before it is ignited by "scrubbing" -- exposing it to water and highly alkaline chemicals.</p>
        <p>In addition, gas can often be burned at higher efficiency than liquids or solids can, because it can be burned in turbines, high-temperature machines that resemble jet engines tethered to the ground. So a ton of, say, oil, can produce more electricity if gasified for use in a gas-turbine generator than if burned to make steam for powering a conventional generator. Even if the gas is not of high-enough quality to burn in a turbine, gasification can be more efficient than plain burning, proponents say, because it can still capture more calories of heat from the fuel. A Chemical Process</p>
        <p>In the gasifier, some of the fuel is burned to produce the heat needed to create steam and to roast the gas out of garbage. But the hydrogen and oxygen of the steam -- H2 O -- react with carbon and other elements in the material being gasified to produce a flammable gas. The gas can include methane (CH4 ), which is the main element in natural gas, as well as carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen gas (H2 ), both of which burn readily. Two-Stage Plant Designed</p>
        <p>The Italian design is for a two-stage plant, one that makes brick-shaped blocks of ground-up trash, after removing large metal objects and all ferrous -- or iron-bearing -- materials. The bricks are processed at 285 degrees Fahrenheit, a temperature high enough to prevent fermentation, reducing the garbage's odor.</p>
        <p>The bricks are then loaded into a gasifier, a tall metal vessel. At the bottom, some of the bricks burn, providing the heat for the gasification. But most of the content is turned into gas as the garbage bricks interact with steam piped into the gasifier. Bricks are introduced at the top and slowly work their way down, with most of the material gasified and some ending up as ash. A controlled amount of air is blown in from the bottom -- enough to facilitate the process without burning the gas. Avoiding Dioxin</p>
        <p>In a conventional incinerator the chlorine from PVC plastics and other sources can form dioxin, a much-feared poison. But in the gasifier, Mr. Rovere said, the chlorine reacts with the hydrogen from the steam to form hydrochloric acid, which is eventually washed out of the gas.</p>
        <p>Italians "know something about dioxin," Mr. Rovere said, referring to an industrial accident in Seveso in 1976 that spread large amounts of dioxin, causing some residents to become seriously ill and requiring many acres to be fenced off.</p>
        <p>Conventional gasifiers that run on coal or oil produce a corrosive tar residue, Dr. Bekowies of the New York Sanitation Department noted. But that residue results from the big hydrocarbon molecules in coal and oil, Mr. Rovere said, and they are not present in trash.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rovere said that a gasifier could operate profitably on a far smaller scale than an incinerator, because of lower capital costs. His analysis of a gasifier that would handle 42,000 tons a year -- or about what New York City buries at the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island every three days -- predicts that the machine would pay for itself in less than a year and a half.  City Running Out of Sites</p>
        <p>That assessment may be a trifle optimistic, assuming a price for the electricity produced of 8 cents a kilowatt-hour, which is below retail in New York but still well above the wholesale rate in the recent depressed market. But for New York City the biggest issue is the cost of alternative disposal. Fresh Kills will be out of space in a decade or two, depending on various trends, and the city does not have enough alternatives lined up; it is now tentatively looking for commercial landfills outside the city, but does not know what they would cost.</p>
        <p>Another way to look at the project is in efficiency terms. The pressed bricks have an energy value of about 5,000 British thermal units per pound, which is only one-third to one-half the energy value of a pound of coal. On the other hand, coal has to be dug out and shipped to a power plant; garbage can arrive at the plant free, since it has to be collected anyway.</p>
        <p>Mannesmann Italiana S.p.A., a diversified industrial company, operates a gasifier in Vicenza, using bricks of pressed, shredded garbage, and burns the gas in a nearby steel plant.</p>
        <p>Air emissions are "well below the limits fixed by the European Community," Fulco Semiani, managing director of the ecology department of the company, wrote in a faxed response to a reporter's question.  Political Opposition Cited</p>
        <p>Industrie Laterizi Vogheresi, a maker of terra cotta tile, opened a similar machine in 1990, in Pavia, Italy, with financial help from the European Community, Carlo Alberto Bosi, managing director, said. The gas was used in the plant's kiln, he said in a telephone interview, but because of local environmentalists' opposition the gasifier was closed. He insisted that the opposition was "political, not on a real scientific base."</p>
        <p>He would like to reopen it, he said, as a hedge against higher prices of oil and gas. "It is safe and can operate properly," Mr. Bosi said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bekowies said, "We are up to our elbows in analyses of gasifiers." In New York, where "not in my backyard" sentiment runs strong, he said, a gasifier would have to be proved safe "at least to the level of rigor you'd have to prove an incinerator."</p>
        <p>Given that neighbors are still fighting the Brooklyn incinerator plan tooth and nail, that might be a substantial burden of proof.</p>
