        <p>HENRY FORD was a young mechanic at the Detroit Edison Company in 1896 when he had a chance to meet his hero Thomas Edison.</p>
        <p>''This young fellow has made some sort of car he runs with gasoline,'' Ford's boss told Edison, according to an account from the 1987 book ''The Fords: An American Epic.'' Ford described to Edison the car and its internal-combustion engine.</p>
        <p>Edison, being the patron of electricity, had tinkered with electric cars, but was intrigued. ''This car has an advantage over the electric car because it supplies its own power,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Young man,'' he told Ford, ''you have the right idea. Keep right at it.''</p>
        <p>More than a century later, it is electric not gas on the minds of automakers. Last month, the Ford Motor Company decided to abandon its electric-vehicle division, Think -- the latest setback in the quest for a mass-market electric car. In the infancy of automobiles, some thought electricity or steam power would beat out the internal-combustion engine, but it was Ford's Model T that shaped the industry.</p>
        <p>Since Edison's day, the fundamental problems of battery-powered cars have never been solved. They do not produce their own power, cannot travel far enough and take hours to recharge. Although they can work well in limited circumstances, they do not appeal to the broad car-buying market.</p>
        <p>In the last decade, a new wave of industry effort on battery power was driven by California's zero-emission vehicle mandate, set in motion in 1990. The Z.E.V. mandate, as it is known, will require automakers to derive 10 percent of their sales from highly efficient cars, and some from vehicles with no tailpipe emissions at all. California regulators see this as an attempt to clean the state's air. Many automakers view it as a threat to their businesses. California is not just the largest auto market in the United States, but because its clean air rules predate the federal Clean Air Act, other states can follow California's tougher air regulations, as New York and Massachusetts do.</p>
        <p>The Z.E.V. mandate was supposed to take effect with the 2003 model year, but has been stalled by a legal challenge from General Motors and DaimlerChrysler. California regulators plan to rewrite the rule some time next year. Still, because it takes years to develop new cars, automakers have been at work. Detroit's concerns were intensified after California passed a new regulation this year that will force carmakers to cut carbon dioxide emissions by the 2008 model year.</p>
        <p>The latest efforts to build battery-powered electrics have been as frustrating as previous attempts. Toyota has sold a few electric RAV4 sport utility vehicles in California, but at a considerable loss. Ford's worldwide goal was to sell 5,000 Think City subcompact cars annually, but it ended up selling just over 1,000 in three years, plus a few more Think Neighbors, a small vehicle akin to a golf cart. G.M. scrapped its EV-1, a sporty two-seat car, because it could travel only about 80 miles between charges. But some drivers who leased EV-1's want to keep them and have started a protest Web site, www.cleanup-gm.org.</p>
        <p>But the electric vehicle is not dying. It is being reinvented with an on-board power source. Hybrid cars like the Toyota Prius, the Honda Insight and a new version of the Honda Civic have both gasoline engines and electric motors, and split their output so that each is operating when it is more efficient. Another technology in development is the fuel cell, which uses hydrogen to form an electrical current and emits water vapor. Automakers are working on fuel cell cars, but significant hurdles remain. The technology is not expected on the road in any significant numbers until at least the end of the decade.</p>
        <p>John White, a representative for the Sierra Club, said he was encouraged by the new technologies though disappointed that Ford and G.M. had not tried harder to market battery-powered electric cars.</p>
        <p>''We are nondenominational in our enthusiasm for technologies,'' he said. ''What we care about is clean air and developing technologies sooner that will be less of a burden on the planet.''</p>
