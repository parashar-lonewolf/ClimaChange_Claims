        <p>I feel pretty, oh, so pretty,</p>
        <p>I feel pretty and witty and  not gay,</p>
        <p>But very pleased to put the issue</p>
        <p>Of those phone calls behind us.</p>
        <p>I usually have trouble expressing my emotions, but today I just want to sing.</p>
        <p>Today I don't even care about the Spot because, hey, I'm off the spot.</p>
        <p>Janet Reno has made me so darn giddy. It's not tactical joviality, as in my New Yorker interview with Joe Klein, who said I was trying too hard. Now I've learned to calibrate better and stop giggling and weeping just to show I can loosen up. Now I know how to do untactical joviality.</p>
        <p>I am just so relieved that I got this independent counsel monkey off my back. Freeh is no Hoover, thank goodness. He just stamps his feet.</p>
        <p>Way to go, Janet! I can admit now that Bill and I were really scared for awhile that the big gal was not on the team. We thought she might be some alligator-wrestling, man-hating oddball who'd tar our hides just to prove her Feisty Independence. Wow! She sure has been on a world-class ego trip. Stringing out our misery until the last possible second, enjoying all the attention.</p>
        <p>Well, she won't be around for the Gore Administration. She can head off into the sunset with Donna Shalala in that truck she dreams about with the cooler and the stove and the dresser and the cot. I'm going to have someone more dependable at Justice, my own Ed Meese, someone who appreciates the importance of a very, very narrow interpretation of the law.</p>
        <p>Bill says now we can finally get back to business as usual. Of course,  stepping in messes is his business as usual. Being his Vice President is like being one of those soldiers in World War II who used to walk in front of Patton's tank to check for mines. No wonder my nerves are shot.</p>
        <p>No one understands how hard it is for me. The whole Prince Albert thing. So much is expected. I look so great on paper. I look so great in person. But I have a nameless dread of failure.</p>
        <p>Bill says we have to act nonchalant. Geez, he was even nonchalant about Saddam. But we're not free and clear yet. We still have the Babbitt investigation, and that one may be tougher to slither out of.</p>
        <p>While the coast is sort of clear, I'm having a coming-out party this week, running hither and yon, talking about AIDS, Internet safeguards, education, the environment, setting up my issues. Hillary's annoyed at me. She thinks I didn't try hard enough on fast track. She thinks I'm coming across as too much of a pantywaist greenie. She doesn't want me screwing up Bill's legacy as the leader of a global network of New Democrats. Just get used to it, as McCurry told the idiot press corps. It's my turn.</p>
        <p>Uh-oh. I feel the jitters coming back. I don't feel like singing any more. I don't feel pretty. I mean, I know I am pretty. I just don't feel that way right now.</p>
        <p>My rivals -- those vultures -- are circling. They figure they can use this sleaze stuff to knock me off my throne.</p>
        <p>Will that loser Fred Thompson ever shut up? Senators from Tennessee sure aren't what they used to be. He got out there last night yammering again about the Troubling Array of Facts. Just get used to it.</p>
        <p>Lizard Boy gave a speech up at Harvard, my Harvard, last night practically announcing his candidacy. He's been working on that pounding fist/karate chop action, trying to look forceful. ''We need a Democratic Party where principles trump tactics,'' Gephardt said. ''We need a Democratic Party that is a movement for change -- and not a money machine.'' Gee whiz, who's that aimed at? Just get used to it.</p>
        <p>Cosmic Bob had breakfast with reporters yesterday, practically announcing his candidacy. Kerrey complained that U.S. policy against Saddam is not muscular enough. Who's that aimed at? Just get used to it.</p>
        <p>Boring Bradley is polishing his Q rating with those treacly homilies about the real America on CBS  News. They're like gauzy campaign ads, only he doesn't even have to pay for them with soft money! He did one on his basketball career and said he ''only played clean.'' Who's that aimed at? Just get used to it.</p>
        <p>Heading off to Kyoto now to talk global warming. I'll try not to get too charged up about the earth disappearing. (Like my hair.) Anyhow, I like the earth today.</p>
