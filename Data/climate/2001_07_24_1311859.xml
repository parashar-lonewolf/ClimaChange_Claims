        <p>With the Bush administration on the sidelines, the world's leading countries hammered out a compromise agreement today finishing a treaty that for the first time would formally require industrialized countries to cut emissions of gases linked to global warming.</p>
        <p>The agreement, which was announced here today after three days of marathon bargaining, rescued the Kyoto Protocol, the preliminary accord framed in Japan in 1997, that was the first step toward requiring cuts in such gases. That agreement has been repudiated by President Bush, who has called it ''fatally flawed,'' saying it places too much of the cleanup burden on industrial countries and would be too costly to the American economy.</p>
        <p>Today, his national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, said in Rome, where the president met with the pope, ''I don't believe that it is a surprise to anyone that the United States believes that this particular protocol is not in its interests, nor do we believe that it really addresses the problem of global climate change.'' She reiterated that the president had created a task force to come up with alternatives.</p>
        <p>The agreement by 178 countries was largely the product of give and take involving Japan, Australia, Canada and the European Union. But Japan's role was crucial because it is the largest economy after the United States and its opposition would have killed any agreement.</p>
        <p>Largely as a result of concessions to Japan, the product is a significantly softened version of the Kyoto accord, allowing industrial nations with the greatest emissions of greenhouse gases, principally carbon dioxide, to achieve their cuts with greater flexibility. For example, Japan won a provision to receive credits for reducing the gases by protecting forests that absorb carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>Still, the agreement is a binding contract among nations -- excluding the United States -- under which 38 industrialized countries must reduce those emissions by 2012 or face tougher emissions goals. Those countries now account for close to half of the emissions. The agreement now moves to a complex ratification process that calls for approval from the biggest polluting countries, which can be achieved even with United States opposition.</p>
        <p>Officials from the European Union exulted over the compromise. Olivier Deleuze, the energy and sustainability secretary of Belgium, said there were easily 10 things in the final texts that he could criticize. ''But,'' he said, ''I prefer an imperfect agreement that is living than a perfect agreement that doesn't exist.''</p>
        <p>The Kyoto accord calls for the 38 industrialized countries by 2012 to reduce their combined annual gas emissions to 5.2 percent below levels measured in 1990. It set a different, negotiated target for each, with Japan, for example, accepting a target of cutting gas emissions back to 6 percent below 1990 emissions. Those targets were included in the Kyoto agreement and were untouched by the compromise today. Developing countries do not have to do anything to reduce emissions.</p>
        <p>The biggest sticking point was how much to penalize countries that miss their targets. Japan held out for a fairly painless system. Europe wanted countries that missed targets in the first commitment period, from 2008 to 2012, to pledge to reduce more carbon dioxide in the next period, with the equivalent of penalties plus interest.</p>
        <p>On that point, Europe got its way.</p>
        <p>The talks also clarified the design of the first global system for buying and selling credits earned by reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Such a system tends to focus investment in pollution cleanups where the job can be done effectively and cheaply.</p>
        <p>In general, Japan was in the driver's seat. After Mr. Bush rejected the treaty, Japan became a pivotal player. It sought, and received, extra credits toward its emissions goals for protecting its forests.</p>
        <p>Forest experts calculated that the credits for forests essentially would drop Japan's target from 6 percent below 1990 levels to just 2 percent below. Canada and Russia would gain large forest credits as well.</p>
        <p>But climate scientists said that in most cases the forest credits were not as big a gift as they seemed, and that economic growth -- if continued as projected -- would put all the industrialized countries listed under the treaty 15 or 20 percent above their 1990 levels. So a drop even close to 1990 figures would be a big change, they said, essentially lessening the benefit of the forest credits.</p>
        <p>Still, some participants grumbled about countries getting credit for gas reductions ''by watching trees grow,'' as one environmentalist put it. The compromise was laced with of something for just about everyone.</p>
        <p>The European Union pledged $410 million a year through the first years of the treaty to help developing countries adapt to climate change and build the technological ability to avoid adding to the problem.</p>
        <p>That was something demanded by, among others, Saudi Arabia, among the group of developing countries that are not required to reduce their emissions.</p>
        <p>The difficulties in moving ahead on the Kyoto Protocol far exceeded those surrounding other environmental treaties, experts said, because the treaty, by controlling carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, would limit something released by almost every act of daily living.</p>
        <p>That this was an economic as well as environmental treaty was evident at every turn.</p>
        <p>''This protocol is about the climate, but it is also about the interests of each country,'' explained Ali Al-Naimi, the Saudi oil minister.</p>
        <p>Indeed, he said, Saudi Arabia's interest lay not so much in curtailing gases, but in preventing economic disruption should the treaty lead the world to curtail its use of oil.</p>
        <p>Much of the momentum appeared to be maintained personally by Jan Pronk, the indefatigable Dutch environment minister and chairman of the talks here. Mr. Pronk often locked himself in a room with clusters of delegates. By dawn today, dozens of delegates were sprawled asleep on every spare cushion and couch in the meeting rooms of the Maritim Hotel.</p>
        <p>In the end, the diverse array of countries at the table, faced with the possibility of an embarrassing collapse of the entire treaty, overcame their differences.</p>
        <p>The compromise caps a six-year struggle between a group of industries and countries that claimed mandatory emissions caps would harm economies, and environmental groups and other nations that saw such limits as the only way to stave off potentially disruptive climate shifts.</p>
        <p>At the meeting, there were unusual combinations of interests, with companies that build nuclear power plants eager to jump into the climate fight because nuclear power produces electricity without emitting greenhouse gases. Japan, Canada, China and other countries supported credits toward emission targets by substituting nuclear power.</p>
        <p>But the European Union, despite wide use of nuclear power in some large European countries, insisted there be no nuclear option in the agreement.</p>
        <p>To some of the participants here, the achievement was a bit hollow given that the United States, which by some measurements accounts for about 25 percent of greenhouse gases, chose not to participate.</p>
        <p>Others noted that, among them, the three dozen industrialized countries that supported the treaty language accounted for far more emissions than the United States.</p>
        <p>Environmental campaigners said Europe had proved it could lead despite its sometimes fragmented appearance.</p>
        <p>''There's really a new force on the world stage,'' said Philip Clapp, the president of the National Environmental Trust, a lobbying group based in Washington. ''If the United States will not lead, Europe can and will.''</p>
        <p>Many of the negotiators from other countries held out hope that, eventually, the United States would rejoin the pact.</p>
        <p>Chances of that happening in the short run are slim. During the session celebrating the accord, Paula Dobrianksy, the under secretary of state for global affairs, congratulated the parties to the protocol but reiterated a common theme of the Bush administration -- that it was ''not sound policy.'' She did not come to Bonn with any alternative ideas.</p>
        <p>Japan's environment minister, Yoriko Kawaguchi, in a clear reference to the United States, said it was important to try to build a bridge between the Kyoto process and countries waiting on the sidelines.</p>
        <p>''In order to achieve the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol, we need to have the widest possible participation of countries,'' Ms. Kawaguchi said. ''We should try to encourage all our friends to join us in our common effort to address global warming.''</p>
