        <p>SIGNALING a change in public policy for Long Island's South Shore, the Army Corps of Engineers and New York State have agreed to abandon a $52 million project to construct oceanfront dunes and beaches along 11.3 miles of the most heavily developed areas of Fire Island.</p>
        <p>Army Corps and state officials said last week that they would now turn their attention to a larger project first authorized by Congress 41 years ago to address conditions along an 83-mile stretch of the South Shore from Fire Island Inlet to Montauk Point.</p>
        <p>And as they do, greater consideration will be given to what is known as a nonstructural approach to shoreline management that emphasizes  allowing nature to take its course and seeking to keep development out of harm's way. This approach is supported by state and national environmental organizations and is apparently gaining currency among government agencies. It would rule out  so-called hardened structures like  jetties and groins and would also stop or sharply limit dumping sand to build up dunes and widen beaches for storm protection.</p>
        <p>The nonstructural approach is already in use in the Fire Island National Seashore. Its parent agencies,  the National Park Service and the  Interior Department, opposed the $52 million project, officially called the Fire Island Interim Project, and refused to consider repeated sand dumping in the park's wilderness area.</p>
        <p>Proponents of nonstructural methods say that scientific evidence shows that dunes and beaches on barrier islands like the 31-mile-long Fire Island will restore themselves naturally if they are not impeded by oceanfront development or coastal engineering. They envision buying up  land to create a ''no development'' buffer zone along the Atlantic.</p>
        <p>The effects of global warming and rising sea level on the barriers, not considered in earlier studies, may also be addressed in the larger coastal project.</p>
        <p>The shift away from large-scale engineering projects may reflect public opposition and a lack of political will to allocate money for work that many see as most benefiting  private oceanfront communities. And changes in federal budget priorities under the Bush administration may also mean that less money will be available.</p>
        <p>A project manager in the Army Corps New York district office, Clifford Jones, said the corps had abandoned the interim project after it appeared that New York State would not approve permits for it and because of ''internal concerns'' and ''a number of concerns as to the benefits.'' Mr. Jones said it made more sense now to proceed with the larger project, usually called the reformulation project.</p>
        <p>The state, which joined with property owners in asking the Army Corps to take on the interim project after severe storms battered Fire Island in 1992 and 1993, has not yet formally announced its decision to withhold two permits that would allow that project to proceed.</p>
        <p>But last week a state official, who spoke on the condition that his name not be used, called the interim project ''a rush to sand.'' The official said the state would not officially support it and preferred awaiting the reformulation project.</p>
        <p>''The barrier islands have been around for thousands of years, and they are not going to disappear overnight,'' the official said. He contends  that some proponents of the interim project tried to generate fears that it had to go forward at once to avoid catastrophe.</p>
        <p>Fire Island property owners say  that the shift toward what they derisively call a back-to-nature approach means that scores of houses will be destroyed and that the mainland will be in greater danger in future storms. One owners' group says it will file a federal lawsuit to reinstate the interim project.</p>
        <p>The owners say the larger project from Fire Island Inlet to Montauk Point is 10 or more years away, if it  begins at all. In any case, they say, it will do nothing for current problems caused by erosion and past storm damage.</p>
        <p>''You will never hear the state say it, but the policy now is to roll back development on the barrier islands because that's what the environmental groups have said is needed,'' said Gerard Stoddard, the president of the Fire Island Association, a group representing most of the 4,000 property owners on Fire Island. ''Now they will delay the reformulation project. That's the whole strategy.''</p>
        <p>The interim project, which was supposed to fit within the later reformulation project, had come under withering criticism from environmental critics who said that it would protect private property at public expense while causing environmental harm.</p>
        <p>Susan Antenen, the director of coastal conservation for the Nature Conservancy on Long Island, said the project ''would have set a precedent that would be ecologically damaging to the beaches, wetlands and Great South Bay, and it was expected to encourage new development on the oceanfront.''</p>
        <p>The critics and coastal experts, including Dr. Stephen P. Leatherman, the director of the Laboratory for Coastal Research at Florida International University in Miami, also rejected a finding in a 1999 Army Corps environmental study that 80 percent of the interim project's benefits would be on the South Shore mainland because widened beaches and restored dunes would reduce coastal flooding and storm damage.</p>
        <p>But the group planning the federal court action, the New York Coastal Partnership, which currently has only a handful of members, said the Army Corps and the state were under a legal obligation to proceed with the interim project and would be guilty of illegal taking private property from Fire Island landowners if they did not.</p>
        <p>The group's lawyer, Irving Like of Bay Shore, who owns a summer home in the Dunewood community on Fire Island, said the federal and state governments were culpable because they had carried out beach rebuilding and inlet stabilization projects to the east on the Westhampton barrier island and at Shinnecock and Moriches Inlets. Mr. Like said those projects had interrupted the naturally occurring east-to-west flow of sand along the shoreline and were the principal causes of erosion damage on sand-starved Fire Island.</p>
        <p>''The problem on Fire Island is not just due to nature, it's due to man's tampering with natural processes,'' Mr. Like said.</p>
        <p>Constantine Dillon, the superintendent of the Fire Island National Seashore, said construction of houses in what is called the coastal erosion hazard area -- the beach and dunes  nearest the ocean -- was causing erosion and endangered the national park. ''You cannot have houses and dunes in the same place at the same time,'' he said. He said that building continued unabated despite park objections.</p>
        <p>Daniel J. Gulizio, the commissioner of planning and development for the Town of Islip, which includes the most populated area of Fire Island,  confirmed that building permits continued to be issued. ''If government were to deny all reasonable use, that would in effect be a taking of private property, which would then require the acquisition of the property,'' he said.</p>
