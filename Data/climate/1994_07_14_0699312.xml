        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>After seeing a news report highlighting advice from the weather services now being disseminated to the American public about ultraviolet radiation factors for the following day, I was surprised that it has taken America this long to educate itself about the risks of sun exposure.</p>
        <p>Among the precautions that people are being advised to take are wearing loose, light-colored clothing, drinking plenty of liquids, preferably water, as opposed to alcoholic or sweetened or caffeinated beverages, wearing a large-brimmed hat to protect the face and wearing coated sunglasses to protect the eyes.</p>
        <p>Take it from a country that does not benefit from a sheltering smog and has little or no ozone layer left. Always wear a sunscreen with a sun protection factor of at least 15 (you'll still get a tan) and don't go out into the sun between 11 A.M. and 3 P.M. Don't bother listening to your weather reporter. STEPHANIE PRATT  Canberra, Australia, July 4, 1994</p>
