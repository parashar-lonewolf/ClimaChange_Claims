        <p>Luis Basanta has a very particular way of looking at Madrid's garbage dump. Where others see only a coarse and foul-smelling wasteland, Mr. Basanta sees life.</p>
        <p>The other morning Mr. Basanta focused his binoculars on a flock of large kites gliding overhead, prospecting morsels for breakfast. A family of storks and a dozen egrets and teals flapped nearby. Soon a lone sparrow hawk appeared.</p>
        <p>"Magnificent," he said, now turning his attention to dark creatures picking at a fetid pile. "See those ravens and those jackdaws," he exulted. "They are the cleverest, the most daring of them all."</p>
        <p>Mr. Basanta is one of nine ornithologists studying the main garbage dump at Valdemingomez, 20 miles north of the capital. Amid the refuse of Madrid, they have found nothing less than a birds' paradise.</p>
        <p>Food is so plentiful that the storks of central Spain no longer bother to go to Africa in winter. Kites now stay the winter as well, and so do smaller migrants. The researchers have counted more than 130 local bird species around the garbage dump and see more coming every year, birds in residence and birds of passage. Spain's Ornithological Society believes that this is the liveliest garbage dump in Europe.</p>
        <p>"It is a terrible wound in nature, of course," Mr. Basanta said of the mounds of waste that keep swelling at the rate of almost two million tons per year. "But there is some beauty. Nature is slowly reclaiming and transforming this artifice."</p>
        <p>There was a tinge of pride as he described how these 20th-century birds use the dump to get building materials. Climbing into storks' nests, he has found them lined with plastic bags, strips of textile and rubber, even bits of plastic foam.</p>
        <p>This spring he watched a male stork preparing a nest. "He had a big ribbon trailing behind him, I think a videotape," he said. "He looked like a comet flying by."</p>
        <p>But any nature story would be incomplete without an environmental conflict.</p>
        <p>The city, which owns the landfill, wants to close it and do the modern thing, which is to send the waste to a newly built incinerator. Environmental groups oppose the incinerator because, they say, its emissions are bad for people, nature and the ozone layer. Instead, they say, because the landfill has become a breeding ground, it should remain in use and must be declared a bird sanctuary and nature reserve.</p>
        <p>City officials call the demand absurd and old-fashioned. "That incinerator will be innocuous and all of Europe uses them," said Esperanza Aguirre, in charge of environmental affairs in the city administration.  "We know the landfill is attractive for birds. But that's not its purpose."</p>
        <p>For the moment, breakfast remains a busy time out on the straw-brown plain outside Madrid. Birds hovered near the spot where trucks spat out their loads of garbage and the wind blew methane, sulfur and other nauseating gases that floated up in the early morning sun.</p>
        <p>Jose Maria Cornejo has worked at the dump for all of its 16 years and knows the 300-acre site like his own yard. He remembers the first gulls and red kites arriving. Even partridges have now settled nearby because the area is so quiet. The partridges have attracted hunters and rifles. Nowadays, in winter, there may be as many as 100,000 birds, more than half of them gulls, researchers said.</p>
        <p>"This is the main dining room," Mr. Cornejo said, heading for a patch where tractors spread out the fresh new loads from the city. Two rows of hefty storks hopped right behind them, neatly lined up like a group of demonstrators. On an invisible cue, they all started rummaging in the mass of rotting meat and vegetables. "Bird noses are not very well developed," Mr. Basanta said.</p>
        <p>"I'd say those are the living quarters," Mr. Basanta went on, training his binoculars on the landfill's far edge where old layers of waste have formed a scarp over 200 feet high. He has found nests there of sand martins, jackdaws and linnets.</p>
        <p>The new habitat has caused some worries, including reports that the gulls were spreading diseases like salmonella. Four years ago, the Ornithological Society did a study.</p>
        <p>"We found nothing," said Fernando Barrios, a biologist with the society. "It may be amazing, but the birds are in perfect health. They have gastric juices that can cope with much more than we thought."</p>
        <p>On a mound that was taking on the black glow of compost, Mr. Cornejo pointed at the shells of clams and shrimps and chicken bones. "Paella," Mr. Cornejo declared. "The birds love it."</p>
        <p>Suddenly a dozen large dogs appeared, drooling and growling. "Wild dogs," Mr. Cornejo said. "We also have foxes. They have practically stopped hunting though. Foraging takes less energy."</p>
        <p>Such changing animal habits sometimes worry the biologists studying the dump. Mr. Basanta said that such worries included the birds that used to migrate to central Africa but have now stopped.</p>
        <p>"Is this good or bad?" he asked.  "From the point of view of the species, it's negative because humans have influenced this."</p>
        <p>A short bird's flight away from the dump was an even stranger example of nature's adjustment to urban life. On top of half a dozen radio transmission towers, storks had found the best vantage points and built large nests, 200 feet above the ground.</p>
        <p>Atop one of the towers a floundering young bird stood flapping and exercising its wings. "That one had better learn to fly right away," Mr. Basanta said. "If it falls down, the foxes will get it."</p>
