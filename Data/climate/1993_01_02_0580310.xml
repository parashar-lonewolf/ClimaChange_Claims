        <p>The Op-Ed Page asked students in two New York City school districts, District 9 in the South Bronx and District 28 in Bayside, Queens, to write about their hopes and fears. Here are excerpts from their essays. Charisse Rice</p>
        <p>4th grade, (Mount Hope) P.S. 28 Tremont, the Bronx</p>
        <p>I hope people who don't have homes have homes.</p>
        <p>I hope rich people be a little poor.</p>
        <p>I hope bad people become good.</p>
        <p>I hope girls in magazines don't be fresh.</p>
        <p>I hope for no guns!</p>
        <p>I hope for no lead in schools, water and buildings.</p>
        <p>I hope for no hate, but love, no judging people by color.</p>
        <p>I hope babies don't cry so much.</p>
        <p>I hope no animals become extinct!</p>
        <p>I hope Clinton doesn't raise taxes!</p>
        <p>I hope everybody learns to love, care and share.</p>
        <p>I hope girls don't put on makeup until their moms tell them to put it on.</p>
        <p>I hope people, and children, watch only 30 minutes of TV a day.</p>
        <p>I hope teachers can get a rest from bad children.</p>
        <p>I hope no one gets hurt anymore from tornadoes, earthquakes or a hurricane.</p>
        <p>I hope people don't be bad and eat until they can't fit through the door.</p>
        <p>I hope people don't eat much sugar and eat more sugarless things.</p>
        <p>I hope people don't say foul language and</p>
        <p>I hope they try to be a saint or an angel.</p>
        <p>I hope people get in shelters who don't have food, clothing and supplies.</p>
        <p>I hope people don't tease people about how they look. To me they look gorgeous and cute.</p>
        <p>I hope someday I can help the environment.</p>
        <p>I hope people don't get H.I.V. positive or AIDS from someone.</p>
        <p>I hope no one gets hurt in a fight.</p>
        <p>I hope for boys to STOP fighting and love!</p>
        <p>I hope a big ship goes to Somalia and stays there if they're bad.</p>
        <p>I hope for people to get well when they're sick.</p>
        <p>I hope homeless people are careful outside.</p>
        <p>I hope everybody would be as good a kid as can be! Benita Liao</p>
        <p>5th grade, P.S. 98 Douglaston, Queens</p>
        <p>Once when I was in this restaurant, I heard this couple saying, "Who would want to hire that lady? She speaks English with an accent." When I heard that I really felt bad deep in my heart. A lot of people in the United States speak with an accent and many of them are very intelligent.</p>
        <p>I think there should be a law against racism and anyone that gets caught should get sent to this really strict camp. This camp should be able to teach the racists how to accept all people. This procedure should not take more than two months and no less than three weeks. Madeline Lluberes</p>
        <p>7th grade, I.S. 148 Morrisania, the Bronx</p>
        <p>My fears are that one day my most precious pride in life will die and I will remain alone in a world of empty streets and people without knowledge. I fear war, racial attacks, slavery, crime and a world full of bad intentions. My fear is that more crimes will be committed</p>
        <p>.</p>
        <p>I am afraid that there will be more and more crack babies born and homeless people in the street and our sisters and brothers starving to death.</p>
        <p>The world is like an apple pie -- anyone can eat at any time, or the world can end at any time. That's my fear -- people getting shot while walking innocently in the streets and all because some crazy person has the urge to do it. David Koontharana</p>
        <p>5th grade, P.S. 213 Bayside, Queens</p>
        <p>I just hope the economy gets better because my dad owns a restaurant in Port Washington and people don't come because they don't have enough money to eat out.</p>
        <p>I have always hoped for world peace. As the great John Lennon once said, "All we are saying is give peace a chance." I can think of tons of ways to solve problems without violence.</p>
        <p>In my school, you can't write in some workbooks because we are out of funds. Also to top it off, the schoolyard has cracks and holes in the pavement and the parks department hasn't fixed it yet. I just want the Mayor to give more money to the schools. Willayie Saygbe</p>
        <p>7th grade, I.S. 148 Morrisania, the Bronx</p>
        <p>While I am growing up I see a lot of young people die, especially in this year.</p>
        <p>Now I just have this strange feeling. The world is going to end soon because everyone is dying. I recall one day I was in an elevator with my two friends and a man and a lady. One friend was telling me that she found out the day before  [ that ]  one of our friends  [ who ]  was related to her. Then my other friend said, everyone is finding relatives  [ who died ] . I said, "Yeah because everyone is dying." The man in the elevator said, "You're very smart, 'cause that's true." Howard Chiou</p>
        <p>4th grade, P.S. 203 Oakland Gardens, Queens</p>
        <p>O.K. What do I hope for in the future? Well, I hope that one day we'll be able to drive in cars that fly and make our lives easy! Ha! Without that much worrying (if you know what I mean). Like people don't have to worry if the earth is going to be destroyed.</p>
        <p>I also hope that everybody would have good jobs and would not be poor, etc., etc., etc. If the whole world would unite, there won't be wars in the future (except in Nintendo). One day we'll be able to communicate better and know each other's feelings. And, of course, you could just rest and not worry about groceries. But, you have to worry about your job. That's what I'm worrying about, and I hope I get a good one.</p>
        <p>I also hope that we could go to Mars instead of Hawaii for vacation in the future, because people might get tired of those places.</p>
        <p>It's time to make pets talk. I think it's time for a BIG change. Matthew Brodis</p>
        <p>6th grade, P.S. 159 Bayside, Queens</p>
        <p>Welcome to the year 2009. It all started when the economy turned around and most people got their jobs back. The business world grew larger and the country got wealthier. Rich and poor were equal, and everyone was successful. People were able to afford large pieces of property.</p>
        <p>There were apartment buildings that were as tall as the Empire State Building. The apartments also had malls. They had artificial beaches, with artificial waves.  They had billiard rooms, ski slopes, ice skating rinks and baseball and football fields.</p>
        <p>Doctors discovered the cure for cancer and other deadly diseases. Astronomers were able to make people fly and they discovered that humankind did exist on other planets.</p>
        <p>New, high-technology vehicles were invented: the subboat was able to glide on top of the water and also submerge, the Airborne Hovercraft glided on air and traveled 500 miles per hour. Then came the Injector, an airplane which got its name from its needle-point nose. There was the Slicer, which is a tube train, that traveled 1,000 miles per hour.</p>
        <p>It is now the year 2015 and even more things have happened! People were making friends with aliens, and scientists found more information on time zones. Time could be frozen. There were electronic comic books. You could join in on TV shows from your home.</p>
        <p>Man now looked for other amusements. As is shown in history, his destructive nature took over. Once again abuse to the environment, waste, greed and hatred were present. We didn't need to look at the calendar. It was 1992 again. Ebonie Smallwood</p>
        <p>4th grade, P.S. 28 Tremont, the Bronx</p>
        <p>I might get a lot of money because I want to be a teacher, doctor, rap person like YoYo and M.C. Lyte, a girl who works at a beauty hair shop, a person who works at a store.</p>
        <p>What if I can't be any of these? These are the things I want to be. But I don't want to be a cop because I don't want to die. I'm not as brave as a cop is. But I think -- and say -- my future is going to be great. Maria Martinez DeLuca</p>
        <p>7th grade, M.S. 67 Little Neck, Queens</p>
        <p>Some people think the world is falling apart. How can we be sure? Some scientists tell us that the earth is in serious trouble, but science has been wrong before. Not too many people really care about the future of the earth. They could be right when they assume that nothing worse could happen to the ozone layer or the environment. On the other hand, they could be wrong.</p>
        <p>The future of many animals doesn't seem too bright. How would life be without wild elephants or bald eagles? Some could argue that it would change the lives of many. Of course, some "future" studies could prove that what we are doing to the animals is perfectly all right, as long as a few are saved.</p>
        <p>Many of us do not live in the same neighborhoods or cities or states or countries from where our ancestors originated. We are sometimes taken to see these places of our past. The future might include a trip we take with our descendants to show them the old, battered neighborhood of the earth. Franchesca Ho Sang</p>
        <p>4th grade, P.S. 28 Tremont, the Bronx</p>
        <p>My fears for the future are a lot of things. My fears are that I'm not going to live to see the future. I say this because there is so much killing going on in high schools.</p>
        <p>My hopes are peace on earth, to graduate, go to college, be a doctor. I decided to be a doctor when I was about 3 years old. People say that it is a very young age to make such a big decision. But I don't think so because I still haven't changed my mind yet and I turned 9 yesterday. And I even have a stethoscope and it is a real one.  Deena Engelman</p>
        <p>5th grade, P.S. 205 Bayside, Queens</p>
        <p>It's really hard to know at the age of 10 what I really want out of life but I will try to tell you some of my hopes and dreams for my future.</p>
        <p>After I finish high school, I would like the opportunity to go to a wonderful college. The ones I have heard so much about and hope to possibly be accepted to are Harvard or Yale. There I will try to obtain the highest grades and really study hard to achieve my goals.</p>
        <p>After I finish college, I would like to then get married, move to L.A., live in a large white house and begin raising a family. I hope that I have twins to love and enjoy.</p>
        <p>Once my children grow a little older, I would like to go back to work. However, my main concern will always be my family. I also would hope that my parents would be living nearby to enjoy their grandchildren. In my spare time, I hope to be involved in many community activities where I will be helping others. Possibly in a hospital or shelters. Mankazon Tidoe</p>
        <p>4th grade, P.S. 28 Tremont, the Bronx</p>
        <p>I hope the future will be great for my two sisters and me and for young people too. There will be great schools, free of violence. I hope that by the year 2000 I will be in a great college and want to be a great doctor when I grow up.</p>
        <p>I wish we could have black people or women as Presidents by the year 2003. My fears are that people will continue to die from AIDS.</p>
        <p>Too many kids will use drugs and start to kill kids and people on the street and in the schools. I fear I will not be safe from the violence. I am scared of kids that drop out of schools. Some of these teen-age girls get pregnant and have an abortion.</p>
        <p>I feel sorry for those kids that cannot walk until they are 3 years old.</p>
        <p>And I don't want stupid wars for nothing. And soldiers will stay -- not going anywhere. I wish Liberia wasn't at war. That's where my family came from. I wish this world was a better place to live in.  Christine Fasano</p>
        <p>9th grade, M.S. 67 Little Neck, Queens</p>
        <p>What is it? How do you get it? Is there a cure? These are three of the many questions people have about cancer. I myself knew little about cancer until my mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer last summer.</p>
        <p>Cancer is considered a silent killer because there are often no or few symptoms until it has spread far beyond control. Over one million people per year are stricken with cancer and more than half of them die. I hope in the future that number can be drastically reduced. Through research and public awareness I believe we can increase the survival rate of people stricken with cancer.</p>
        <p>I hope that one day in the near future I will turn on the television and learn about the symptoms of cancer. I hope cancer will get as much publicity as AIDS does today. Nancy Torres</p>
        <p>4th grade, P.S. 28 Tremont, the Bronx</p>
        <p>My fears are that everything that might happen in the future is happening today. I'm afraid that the violence and drug abuse is not going to stop. People are going to keep on dying of poverty, homelessness, drug wars and AIDS.</p>
        <p>My hopes are that I will finish school and receive a good education. I hope someday I will be able to work for an advertising firm. I also hope that I can help my family out. And to someday get married and have a family of my own.  Jessica Berrins</p>
        <p>4th grade, P.S. 133 Bayside, Queens</p>
        <p>I have many hopes for my family as the New Year gets closer. This year was not a very good one for us and I'm hoping things will go better in 1993.</p>
        <p>My grandpa is sick. He has a tumor in his stomach and had to go to the hospital. When he was well, my grandpa would take me to the park. Now I'm worried that we will not be able to spend as much time together.</p>
        <p>I'm also hoping that my mom can find a second job. She works with disabled children and loves what she does but she is not making enough money. My mom talks about going to exotic places where it is hot. I'd like her to make more money this year so that she and I can vacation in Hawaii or Florida. This would really make her happy.</p>
        <p>My mom and dad are divorced and I love them both. I also hope to spend more time with both my parents this year but especially my dad. We only see each other twice a week and I know his back is hurting him all the time. In 1993, I expect my mom, dad and me to be happy. It is my greatest hope.</p>
