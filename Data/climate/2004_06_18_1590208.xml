        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.</p>
        <p>Now Playing</p>
        <p>''BROADWAY: THE GOLDEN AGE.'' Produced, written and directed by Rick McKay. (not rated; 111 minutes.) Even though this anecdotal history took five years to complete, it often feels as if it were all filmed at the same late-night after-theater party at which assorted legends are accosted by a star-struck interviewer and asked to say a few words for the camera. The stories they tell about the Broadway stage in the 1940's, 50's and 60's, and about scuffling in New York City in less opulent times, could fill a book of Broadway theatrical lore. Some of the archival material is impressive: an excerpt from a live audio recording of Marlon Brando's stage performance in ''A Streetcar Named Desire''; grainy snippets of musicals filmed from orchestra seats; and a 1938 screen test of the actress Laurette Taylor, whom several of the talking heads exalt as the greatest theater actor they ever saw (Stephen Holden).</p>

        <p>''BROADWAY: THE GOLDEN AGE.'' Produced, written and directed by Rick McKay. (not rated; 111 minutes.) Even though this anecdotal history took five years to complete, it often feels as if it were all filmed at the same late-night after-theater party at which assorted legends are accosted by a star-struck interviewer and asked to say a few words for the camera.

        <p>''THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK.'' Starring Vin Diesel. Written and directed by David Twohy (PG-13, 115 minutes). The concentration of synthetic hormones pumping through the vascular system of ''The Chronicles of Riddick'' matches any recent action-adventure movie in the sheer density of steroids per liter of body fluid. In bodybuilding terms, this overmuscled sequel to ''Pitch Black'' is all bulk and no definition. In touch with the grunting, preening culture of professional wrestling, the negligible screenplay by Mr. Twohy, who directed both movies, is crammed with trailer-ready tag lines. Intoned by Mr. Diesel with a sly comic gravity, these enigmatic blurbs mean next to nothing. Returning from ''Pitch Black,'' Mr. Diesel's character, Riddick, a fugitive from a distant planet, pursued across the universe by bounty hunters, might be described as the heavy-metal version of Brad Pitt's Achilles in ''Troy.'' Here he runs afoul of the Necromongers, an evil race of conquerors. The movie is all about nonstop action, computer generated spectacle and sanitized sadomasochism, edited into one big roaring whir (Holden).</p>
        <p>* ''COFFEE AND CIGARETTES,'' starring Cate Blanchett, Alfred Molina, Bill Murray, Meg White, Jack White and Steve Coogan. Written and directed by Jim Jarmusch (R, 96 minutes). Over 17 years, in the midst of other, more ambitious projects, Mr. Jarmusch assembled this anthology of minor-key vignettes in celebration of caffeine, nicotine and the indolent pleasure of sitting around and consuming them. Not that the people in the film are always having such a good time: they seem, rather, to get on one another's nerves with some regularity. Some of the chapters are almost vanishingly slight -- hipster anecdotes that float away like smoke rings. Others -- notably a hotel bar encounter in which Ms. Blanchett plays herself and a resentful cousin, and a game of celebrity one-upmanship between Mr. Molina and Mr. Coogan -- have the compact perfection of good one-act plays (A. O. Scott).</p>
        <p>''THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW,'' starring Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal. Directed by Roland Emmerich (PG-13, 117 minutes). Tornadoes in Los Angeles. Hail in Tokyo. The entire Northern Hemisphere encased in a sheet of ice, with uncountable casualties, including life as we know it. All of which adds up, in the hands of Mr. Emmerich, to a sprawling, oddly lighthearted action picture. The computer-generated special effects are awesome, though not in the traditional sense of the word. As you watch cities obliterated by wind, water and ice, you don't think, ''My God, how horrible''; you think, ''Cool!'' The only one who seems genuinely worried is Mr. Quaid, playing a scientist whose apocalyptic warnings are ignored until it's too late. He sets out to find his son (Mr. Gyllenhaal), who is stranded at the New York Public Library and who seems, all in all, pretty relaxed. Like most disaster films, this one is ultimately more soothing than alarming, which may undermine its supposed ambition to raise awareness about the perils of climate change (Scott).</p>
        <p>''GARFIELD.'' With Breckin Meyer and Jennifer Love Hewitt. Directed by Pete Hewitt (PG, 93 minutes). Jim Davis's lazy, lasagna-loving feline has been plucked from the funny pages and turned into a computer-generated dancing blob with the voice of Bill Murray. Why anyone thought this was a good idea is beyond me, but the movie is at least short and relatively low-key. There are two pointless plots, one involving a dognapper (Stephen Tobolowsky), the other a romance between Garfield's owner, Jon (Mr. Meyer) and a cute veterinarian (Ms. Hewitt). Even the most devoted cat-lovers will be better served by a plate of reheated lasagna and a nice nap (Scott).</p>
        <p>''HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN.'' Starring Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson. Directed by Alfonso Cuarón (PG, 136 minutes). Taking over the franchise from Christopher Columbus, Mr. Cuarón injects this third Potter picture with a shadowy, sensual mood. The look is grainier and grimier, and the themes are a bit darker and more unsettling than those in ''The Sorcerer's Stone'' or ''The Chamber of Secrets.'' There is less Quidditch and more Snape (Alan Rickman), which is all to the good, as are the efforts of new cast members like Michael Gambon (taking over for Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore), Emma Thompson (as a batty divination teacher), David Thewlis (as the latest defense-against-the-dark-arts master) and Gary Oldman, who brings his adaptable villainy to the title role. The film's major weakness, sad to say, is Harry himself. Approaching adolescence, Mr. Radcliffe may also be reaching the limit of his range as an actor; he seems unable to summon the complex, volatile emotions that the story demands, with its notes of grief and rage amid the usual boarding-school intrigue. Still, Mr. Cuarón breathes some new life -- and a new sense of mystery -- into a series whose charms are in danger of declining due to overfamiliarity (Scott).</p>
        <p>''MEAN GIRLS,'' starring Lindsay Lohan and Rachel McAdams. Directed by Mark Waters (PG-13, 97 minutes). This tart and often charming new comedy is a version of the heart-of-darkness teenage social comedy ''Heathers'' for the tweener audience; it has the ambitious and cartoony dark side of a Disney Channel sitcom, with a lively and talented young cast. The ''Saturday Night Live'' writer and performer Tina Fey wrote the script and gives the material a stylized vitality. But the film adds a be-yourself finale that this picture doesn't quite seem to buy. It's the kind of bored manipulation you come to expect from the Plastics, the pack of hallway-shrewd and glamorous teenage queens who use subtle terror to rule the high school that Cady (Ms. Lohan) attends. It's her first brush with socialization, since she was home schooled by her zoologist parents in Africa. Though narrative cohesion isn't the strength of ''Girls,'' the intelligence shines through in its understanding of contradictions (Elvis Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''RAISING HELEN,'' starring Kate Hudson, John Corbett and John Cusack. Directed by Garry Marshall (PG-13, 119 minutes). This softhearted, squishy-minded prototype for a network sitcom is mildly ingratiating but never laugh-out-loud funny. Ms. Hudson is the scuffling gal Friday and Little Ms. Fixit to the queenly chief of a New York fashion agency. On the fast track to A-list Manhattan insufferability, she lives out a dreamy, sanitized version of the ''Sex and the City'' lifestyle, partying all night, then skipping into the office all a-bubble with nifty little notions that anticipate her boss's every whim. Her life of fun, fun, fun comes to a screeching halt when her older sister and her husband are killed in a car crash, and their will gives Helen custody of three orphaned children. The rest of the movie tells the warm and fuzzy story of Helen's bumbling surrogate parenthood to the brood she inherits, and her discovery of family values and true romance in an outer borough (Holden).</p>
        <p>''SAVED!'' Starring Jena Malone, Patrick Fugit, Mandy Moore and Macaulay Culkin. Directed by Brian Dannelly (PG-13, 92 minutes). This teenage satire set in a Christian high school is an admirable attempt to acknowledge the powerful influence of religion in contemporary American youth culture. Mr. Dannelly resists easy, smug caricature, but the picture ultimately fails both as comedy and as sentimental melodrama, veering from not-very-funny jokes to canned speeches about tolerance and human fallibility. This is a shame, since the bright young cast (especially Ms. Moore, relishing the chance to play a villainous, self-righteous teenage queen bee) performs with conviction and high spirits. Ms. Malone plays Mary, who becomes pregnant while trying to cure her gay boyfriend and whose crisis separates the pious hypocrites from the decent folk. In the end, ''Saved!'' is an exercise in liberal humanist piety, a peace offering in the culture wars that is sadly unable to realize its good intentions, or to make you laugh (Scott).</p>
        <p>''SHREK 2,'' with the voices of Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Antonio Banderas and Jennifer Saunders. Directed by Andrew Adamson, Kelly Asbury and Conrad Vernon (PG, 93 minutes). This sequel revives the raucous high spirits of its predecessor, with some new characters, jokes and satiric targets to compensate for the loss of novelty. Shrek (Mr. Myers) and Fiona (Ms. Diaz), now married, travel with Donkey (Mr. Murphy) to meet Shrek's in-laws, the king and queen of Far Far Away, which is to Hollywood what Duloc was to Disney in the first ''Shrek.'' There they contend with a scheming fairy godmother (Ms. Saunders) and a swashbuckling, scene-stealing Puss in Boots (Mr. Banderas). The animation has improved, and the cross-generational appeal -- slapstick and moralizing for the kids, cheekiness and pop music for the grownups -- is precisely calibrated and jauntily executed. Still, the cynicism of the enterprise leaves a bit of a sour taste. The movie is too timid to risk genuine ugliness, and too crude to try for real beauty (Scott).</p>
        <p>* ''SINCE OTAR LEFT,'' starring Esther Gorintin, Nino Khomassouridze and Dinara Droukarova. Directed by Julie Bertuccelli (not rated, 102 minutes; in French with English subtitles). Although the title character is seen only fleetingly in blurry snapshots, his presence haunts the imaginations of the three women at the center of this beautifully written and acted drama. Otar, a medical student from the former Soviet republic of Georgia, has fled the bleak, crumbling city of Tblisi, where he grew up, to live in Paris, where he is struggling to make his way without a visa. Left behind are his doting mother (Ms. Gorintin), his sister (Ms. Khomassouridze) and his sister's daughter (Dinara Droukarova). Like Chekhov's ''Three Sisters,'' ''Since Otar Left'' is about yearning as a life force. The mother, a painfully stooped, hobbling old woman, lives for her son's occasional phone calls and letters. When word comes that Otar has died in a construction accident, the sister and granddaughter, afraid to break the news, put on a charade, writing bogus letters that spur the mother to journey to Paris to see her son. The film sustains a fine balance of pathos, humor and a clear-headed realism (Holden).</p>
        <p>''THE STEPFORD WIVES.'' Starring Nicole Kidman and Glenn Close. Directed by Frank Oz. (PG-13, 110 minutes.) Less a remake than a full-scale re-engineering, this adaptation of Ira Levin's dry, efficient suburban gothic turns a dusty 70's thriller into a loud and shiny postmodern farce. The music, by David Arnold, is as dementedly campy as some of the performances, notably Ms. Close's as the robot matriarch of Stepford, Conn. Ms. Kidman plays Joanna Eberhart, a high-powered Manhattan television executive who retreats to Stepford after her career collapses and her marriage (to Matthew Broderick) threatens to do the same. Once there, she discovers that the town's women have all been turned into busty, cheerful automatons who exist to fulfill their husbands' every wish. The screenwriter Paul Rudnick's gags and one-liners are often sly and incisive, but the movie never lives up to its satiric potential, collapsing at the end into incoherence and wishy-washy, have-it-all sentimentality. (Scott).</p>
        <p>''THE STORY OF THE WEEPING CAMEL.'' Directed by Byambasuren Davaa and Luigi Falorni. (PG, 87 minutes.) This lovely, uncomplicated though limited movie is a shaggy-dog story -- well, actually, a shaggy-animal story. The title isn't a metaphor (though the story itself is). The filmmakers have actually made a film about a pale and needy newborn camel whose mother ignores it. After a difficult birth, the mother abandons her calf, refusing to nurse it. In the wrong hands -- probably any other hands -- ''Camel'' would drip with stickiness, and it verges on being an old-school live-action Disney feature. Yet Ms. Davaa and Mr. Falorni deny us the easiness of narration that spells out what their cameras are ably, and simply, filming. They have said they were inspired by the pioneering documentarian Robert Flaherty. This movie follows Flaherty's mission to capture traditions of cultures far from his own. Though similar in motivation, it is modest and leisurely, rather than epic and obsessive like Flaherty's films. The filmmakers' patience and the quality of the images they obtain give a mellow contentment to the project, a thoughtful and honest serenity that is passed on to viewers (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''SUPER SIZE ME,'' directed by Morgan Spurlock (not rated, 96 minutes). For 30 days Mr. Spurlock consumed nothing but food from McDonald's, an experiment in bad living that frames a jaunty critique of junk gastronomy and corporate power. Like a thinner, less aggressive Michael Moore, the director talks to consumers, experts and food-industry flacks, weaving alarming statistics about rampant obesity with visits to the doctor and double-quarter-pounder-with-cheese combo meals. The film is an entertaining statement of the obvious, though its big questions -- Do corporations serve our need or enslave our bodies and souls? Are public health problems caused by capitalist rapacity or personal choice? -- are not as simple as Mr. Spurlock would have us believe (Scott).</p>
        <p>''TROY,'' starring Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom. Directed by Wolfgang Petersen (R, 140 minutes). All the talk of glory and immortality is a clear signal that this big, expensive, intermittently campy example of Hollywood Homerism is desperate to be regarded as a classic. It isn't, but it's not so bad either. Yes, the score is dreadful and the dialogue sometimes painfully obvious, but Mr. Petersen and the screenwriter David Benioff take the ancient world and its notions of war seriously. Despite an odd pseudo-English accent (perhaps adopted in deference to the mostly British and Australian cast), Mr. Pitt plays Achilles with wit and charisma, turning the character into a kind of existentialist warrior rock star. Mr. Bana, as Achilles's Trojan counterpart and nemesis, Hector, has a brooding sensitivity that contrasts with Mr. Pitt's brashness. Some of the battle scenes have a vigorous old-time grandeur, and though it takes some inevitable liberties with the source material, the film is more astute about the political and moral complexities of war than most recent combat pictures (Scott).</p>
        <p>''VAN HELSING,'' starring Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale. Written and directed by Stephen Sommers (PG-13, 125 minutes). A whole lot of monsters -- werewolves, a Frankenstein creation and, above all, Dracula, his three wives and several thousand potential bat-children -- roar and squirm in this long, grinding special-effects migraine. Mr. Sommers, who wrought similar havoc in ''The Mummy'' and ''The Mummy Returns,'' seems to be aiming for a kind of insouciant pop grandeur, something that will mix spookiness and spoofiness in spectacular fashion. But whatever visual and narrative wit there is (and there is a little) is crushed by the lumbering rhythms of the plot and the hectic, murky action sequences. Ms. Beckinsale is Dracula's ancestral nemesis, while Mr. Jackman, with none of the wired gravitas that was so effective in the ''X-Men'' movies, plays the title character, a centuries-old monster fighter with bad amnesia. Lucky him (Scott).</p>
        <p>''WORD WARS.'' Directed by Eric Chaiken and Julian Petrillo. (Not rated, 80 minutes.) The Scrabble champions in this documentary find obscure game-changers in a rack of seven letters, but they can't find their way out of their common obsession. In this film's obvious inspiration, ''Spellbound,'' the audience could always hope that the rote learning of spelling-bee contestants was honing keener minds for happier days. ''Word Wars'' is instead taxing, requiring patience for grainy photography, garage-band power chords and griping childlike contestants. These men can work orthographic wonders, but it never lifts them out of their self-imposed exiles. Without much else racking up points in their isolated lives, the Scrabble players' monomania amounts to little, and these contestants seem like words that lose their beauty when they're never put in a sentence (Ned Martel).</p>
