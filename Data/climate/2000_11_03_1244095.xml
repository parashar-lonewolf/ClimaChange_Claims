        <p>Moving into the final leg of her campaign for Senate, Hillary Rodham Clinton sprinted from Buffalo to Manhattan to Long Island today, trying to do in New York State what Al Gore has studiously avoided doing across the nation: run on the record of the Clinton administration.</p>
        <p>Looking fatigued and swigging bottled water to fight a dry cough, Mrs. Clinton disparaged Representative Rick A. Lazio at every opportunity, describing her opponent's campaign as ''a charade'' intended to hide what she called his conservative and caustic ideology. But even as she attacked Mr. Lazio today for running a ''campaign of insults,'' she released the latest in a parade of notably negative advertisements, this one featuring a clip of Mr. Lazio confronting her in their first debate, demanding that she sign an agreement on campaign financing.</p>
        <p>At a moment in campaigns that politicians typically use to sum up the case for their candidacy, Mrs. Clinton repeatedly returned today to the record of her husband's years as president. While she was sparing in mentioning the president himself, her eagerness to affix her fortunes to his administration during the most-watched stretch of a campaign contrasted sharply with Mr. Gore, the other Democrat who has been seeking to emerge from Mr. Clinton's shadow and has not wanted the president to campaign with him.</p>
        <p>''We've had eight good years: people are working, people are employed, people are buying homes, unemployment is down, and I think the Clinton-Gore administration has done a darn good job on the economy,'' the first lady shouted, her voice hoarse, at a raucous labor rally at a hall in the Manhattan Center on West 34th Street. ''My opponent is saying eight years is enough. I don't know what planet he's on, but I think that eight years has not been enough.''</p>
        <p>''I remember what it was like in 1992 -- it has taken eight years to get this country going in the right direction,'' Mrs. Clinton said. She got so wrapped up that she even invoked the signature theme of her husband's 1992 campaign, telling an audience of students to ''put people first.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's aides said today that the president would come to New York to attend three get-out-the-vote rallies Saturday, in Brooklyn, the Bronx and Harlem. Mrs. Clinton will not be with him at those rallies, though an aide said they might well make several joint appearances before Tuesday. Mr. Clinton also plans to be in New York on Tuesday to listen to the election returns with his wife.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's remarks came on a day when both candidates moved into a high gear of campaigning, each setting a frenetic pace -- in their travels, the release of new advertisements, and a seemingly endless parade of e-mail attacks -- that aides to both said would continue through Monday. And once again, much of the battle was engaged upstate.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton also moved to take advantage of what her aides argued was a mistake by Mr. Lazio, whose campaign released and then pulled back a radio advertisement that attacked her support of the Kyoto treaty on global warming. The advertisement, which was broadcast only upstate, described the pact as ''radical'' and suggested that it would cost jobs in a part of the state where the economy has had some difficulty.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio dropped the advertisement under pressure from environmental groups, and amid concern by some Republicans that the episode could undercut his effort to present himself as a moderate Republican. Mrs. Clinton mentioned the incident today as she said Mr. Lazio was running a negative campaign and had ''no plan'' to address economic problems upstate.</p>
        <p>''My opponent has no plan to bring and attract and keep good jobs here in upstate New York,'' she said. ''And in the absence of a plan, which he has been promising for a week, he put up a misleading and inaccurate radio ad as a smoke screen to try to cover up the fact that he has no plan for the upstate economy.''</p>
        <p>Even as she attacked Mr. Lazio for attacking her, her campaign released one of the toughest advertisements of the contest, including a clip of the moment in which Mr. Lazio walked from his lectern over to hers during their debate in Buffalo and demanded that she sign a written agreement restricting use of soft money in the campaign. ''Right here, right here, sign it,'' Mr. Lazio is shown saying to Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>The confrontational scene was repeatedly played on television at the time, and aides to both candidates believe that it hurt him, particularly among women.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton learned of a bombing in Jerusalem while touring a supermarket warehouse in Buffalo. She retired to a private office and spoke on the telephone before coming out and condemning the attack and calling on Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, to put back in jail the terrorists he had freed in recent weeks.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton acknowledged that she had no idea whether any of those people were involved in the bombing but said, ''It just makes common sense that if you are committed to ending violence and terrorism, you would not let out of prison people who are known to be terrorists.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's repeated efforts today to run on the Clinton administration's record came after 16 months in which she has often seemed unsure about how closely to associate herself with a politician who remains one of the most popular Democrats with New York voters. Mr. Clinton has been only an occasional visitor to New York since she started her campaign.</p>
        <p>But today, speaking to union members, the most solid kind of Democratic audiences, the first lady shed any ambivalence about the association. ''I'm proud of the fact that I am committed to continuing the policies of the past eight years,'' she said.</p>
