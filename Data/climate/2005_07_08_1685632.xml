        <p>The bombings in London on Thursday knocked the meeting of major industrial nations off its carefully scripted focus on global warming and African poverty and turned it into a forum for President Bush and other world leaders to pledge unity in confronting terrorism.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, as the host, had set an agenda that was intended in part to shift the attention away from his support for the war in Iraq and his partnership with Mr. Bush. But even before the first working session started, it was apparent that the tone and substance this meeting of the Group of 8 leaders had been violently reshaped.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush learned of the attacks from Mr. Blair a little over an hour after they occurred, around the start of the first formal meeting, said Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary. Prime Minister Paul Martin of Canada told reporters that Mr. Blair had informed each of the leaders individually as he greeted them, and then updated them when the session began.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Blair left for London several hours later, Mr. Bush and the other leaders who had gathered here at the Gleneagles golf resort made a show of sticking more or less to their schedule of meetings and discussing their differences over how to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush and the American delegation were clearly focused on the terrorist threat. The American president left a meeting during the middle of the morning and, sitting outside his hotel suite, held a videoconference over a secure line with his national security team in Washington to discuss the possible threat to the United States.</p>
        <p>His aides subsequently participated in hourly videoconferences with officials in Washington. During the day, Mr. Bush held informal conversations with some of his counterparts from other nations, and although his aides declined to be specific about what they talked about, they said it would have been natural for him to raise the issue of combating terrorism.</p>
        <p>''The contrast couldn't be clearer between the intentions and the hearts of those of us who care deeply about human rights and human liberty, and those who kill, those who have got such evil in their hearts that they will take the lives of innocent folks,'' Mr. Bush said. ''The war on terror goes on.''</p>
        <p>If the bombings were intended, as Mr. Blair said, to disrupt the summit meeting, they also had the effect of unifying a group of leaders who have had their differences over everything from the war in Iraq to trade and exchange rates.</p>
        <p>In addition to the leaders of the eight major industrial nations -- the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, Canada and Russia -- those of China, India, Mexico, Brazil and South Africa were also on hand for Thursday's session.</p>
        <p>''The leaders will stand firm against this evil,'' said President Vicente Fox of Mexico, adding that the bombings had stirred them all to work harder at coming to agreement on a wide variety of issues, including trade and global warming. ''It is passing from word to action, the spirit coming out of this meeting,'' Mr. Fox said.</p>
        <p>Two European leaders who were frequently at odds with Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair over the war in Iraq pledged to stand shoulder to shoulder with Britain. President Jacques Chirac of France, who has also been squabbling with Mr. Blair on other issues, said his nation was in ''total solidarity'' with the British. Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of Germany said the international community ''must do everything in its power to fight terrorism together with all the means at its disposal.''</p>
        <p>The display of unity may have masked what is sure to be a debate in Britain and elsewhere over whether Britain was attacked because of Mr. Blair's strong support for the invasion of Iraq. And there was little public talk here about the adequacy of international counterterrorism efforts nearly four years after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and the Pentagon.</p>
        <p>With Mr. Blair absent, his place at the meetings was taken by his foreign secretary, Jack Straw. The leaders here canceled their group photo, and some of them acknowledged an obvious degree of distraction. Protesters and advocacy groups that had sought to use the meeting as a platform for their views on addressing poverty and the environment struggled to be heard, or gave up.</p>
        <p>''There has been a great pall cast over the discussion,'' Mr. Martin said.</p>
        <p>It was unclear whether the unity over combating terrorism would extend to the other issues on the table here. By the end of the day, environmental groups were circulating what they said was a draft of the communiqué on global warming, an issue on which Mr. Bush has been at odds with most of the other leaders.</p>
        <p>Reflecting Mr. Bush's concern that too stringent a response to global warming could harm the American economy, the draft contained no specific agreement on concrete steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions on a schedule. It contained a commitment to act with ''resolve and urgency'' on the issue, but also it contained broad caveats that some environmental groups said rendered it almost meaningless.</p>
        <p>''While uncertainty remains in our understanding of climate science, we know enough to act now and to put ourselves on a path to slow and, as science justifies, stop and then reverse the growth of greenhouse gases,'' the draft said.</p>
        <p>Briefing reporters on how the day unfolded, Mr. McClellan said Mr. Bush never considered leaving the summit meeting. After learning of the London bombings at the start of the first meeting, Mr. Bush summoned his national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, and asked him to begin coordinating the American response, Mr. McClellan said.</p>
        <p>Around the same time, he said, Andrew H. Card Jr., the White House chief of staff, learned of news reports about the bombings from one of his deputies, Joe Hagin. Between them, Mr. McClellan said, Mr. Hadley and Mr. Card began calling other officials, including Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Vice President Dick Cheney, who was at his home in Wyoming.</p>
