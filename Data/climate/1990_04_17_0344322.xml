        <p>LEAD: The environment, once dismissed as a fringe cause by many politicians, has reached the forefront of American politics, with candidates for one public office after another proclaiming themselves environmentalists.</p>
        <p>The environment, once dismissed as a fringe cause by many politicians, has reached the forefront of American politics, with candidates for one public office after another proclaiming themselves environmentalists.</p>
        <p>Politicians who were loyal to corporate polluters are recasting their public postures on hazardous waste, acid rain and the stratospheric ozone layer. Republicans, who traditionally stayed clear of the environmental movement, are now battling Democrats for the ''green vote,'' threatening to seize the issue as their own.</p>
        <p>In Oregon, for example, Representative Denny Smith, a Republican running for re-election, last month switched his stand and declared his opposition to oil drilling off the Pacific Northwest. In Florida, Gov. Bob Martinez, a Republican who never mentioned the environment in his 1986 advertisements, opened his re-election campaign this year with a commercial that portrayed him as a dedicated environmentalist.</p>
        <p>Following the Public's Lead</p>
        <p>In Alabama, William J. Cabaniss, a Republican running for the United States Senate, startled the Sierra Club when he wrote a letter seeking support. D. Reid Wilson, the organization's political director, said the request was ''probably the first time an Alabama Republican has been seen courting environmentalists - and a pretty good indication that times are changing.''</p>
        <p>For the most part, the politicians, many of whom will take to the streets this week for festivities leading up to the 20th anniversary on Sunday of the first Earth Day observance, are not setting the pace for Americans on the environmental issue. They are instead following the lead of the public, which feels increasingly threatened by environmental problems and, perceiving a lessened military threat from the Soviet Union, is turning its attention to concerns at home, like polluted air and water.</p>
        <p>Eighty-four percent of Americans say pollution is a serious national problem that is getting worse, a New York Times/CBS News poll reported today. Seventy-four percent said that protecting the environment is so important that requirements and standards cannot be too high and that environmental improve-ments must be made regardless of cost.</p>
        <p>In 1981, 45 percent said they held that belief.</p>
        <p>Votes Did Not Follow Words</p>
        <p>Until now, officeholders have often been able to portray themselves as environmentalists based merely on general comments in support of clean air and water. When it came to actual votes to strengthen pollution controls, which often involve increased fees on industry and possible job losses, the dedication to the environment frequently softened.</p>
        <p>Now many political strategists believe that a second wave of environmental politics may be about to begin, as clean-air and clean-water groups, having won the politicians' verbal backing, pressure them publicly to live up to their words.</p>
        <p>The Times/CBS poll of 1,515 adults nationwide, conducted by telephone March 30 to April 2, measured the strength of the environmental sentiment behind such pressure. Seventy-one percent of Americans said they would be willing to pay higher taxes to clean up the environment; 56 percent said they favored protecting the environment even if it meant lost jobs in their communities. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.</p>
        <p>On one particularly divisive issue, the issuing of offshore oil leases, public opinion has shifted dramatically. In 1981, 26 percent of Americans said they thought the risks to the environment were too great to allow the drilling. In the latest survey, 55 percent said the risks were too great.</p>
        <p>The Constituency Broadens</p>
        <p>The traditional environmental constituency of conservationists and idealistic young people has grown to include the working class and older Americans. The new constituency's interest is not only global, but also personal. One out of every five Americans says he or she knows someone whose health was damaged by pollution, the Times/CBS poll said.</p>
        <p>The political response to such sentiments is reflected in the campaigns around the country this year, with the environment holding its own with crime, drugs and abortion as an overriding issue. Seeking to prove their environmental colors, candidates make sure they are photographed wearing down-filled vests and flannel shirts.</p>
        <p>Many candidates are following the lead of President Bush, who had not been perceived as an environmentalist until he made pollution a major theme of his 1988 campaign. He talked more about the issue than did his Democratic opponent, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, who environmentalists said was more dedicated to the issue.</p>
        <p>Robert M. Teeter, the Bush campaign's poll taker, said the President ''just felt that it was an important issue in the country and that people thought it was important,'' adding that he suspected Mr. Bush ''also had a feeling it was one issue that the Reagan Administration had not done much on.''</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign broadcast an effective television advertisement attacking Mr. Dukakis for not cleaning up Boston Harbor, which was depicted as resembling a pool of sewage. Mandy Grunwald, a consultant for Mr. Dukakis, said that in a matter of hours her company produced an advertisement that essentially said, ''George Bush an environmentalist? You must be kidding!'' The advertisement was never broadcast, aides to Mr. Dukakis said, because the candidate saw them as unnecessary; he did not think voters would believe that Mr. Bush had a better record than his on the environment.</p>
        <p>Credit and Suspicion Mix</p>
        <p>Despite Senate passage of the Clean Air Act last month, for which environmental groups give much credit to Mr. Bush, environmentalists accuse the President of seeking to dilute the bill, and they are suspicious of his chief of staff, John H. Sununu, who says often that new environmental regulations must be measured against free market principles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, seeking to underscore his self-made image as an ''environmental President,'' has scheduled several outdoor appearances this week, to be capped with a weekend of fishing in the Florida Keys. But he has still not convinced the public of his commitment.</p>
        <p>In The Times/CBS poll, 18 percent of Americans said Mr. Bush had really made progress in protecting the environment, while 68 percent said he mainly just talked about it. Even so, people count on the President, with 57 percent saying they trust Mr. Bush to make the right decisions about the environment.</p>
        <p>Since it is often difficult for voters to identify a strong environmental resume, some analysts say there is room for politicians to portray themselves as more environmentalist than they really are.</p>
        <p>''The patterns of voting this year in Congress are not really different than they have been in the past,'' said Samuel P. Hays, a professor of history at the University of Pittsburgh who specializes in environmental politics. ''I'm skeptical that there's going to be a lot of change.''</p>
        <p>''They all want to be on the right side now,'' he added, but explained that behind the scenes, many lawmakers are ''throwing their weight against a comprehensive Clean Air Bill.''</p>
        <p>A Call for Stronger Action</p>
        <p>Jim Maddy, executive director of the League of Conservation Voters, a lobbying group for stronger environmental laws, said environmental groups need to be more aggressive in identifying which candidates are genuinely concerned about the environment.</p>
        <p>''The politicians have beat us at what's supposed to be our own game,'' he said. ''We've not moved quickly enough to set a standard, so each and every politician decides what it takes to be considered a politician who is good on the environment.''</p>
        <p>A case in point is in Illinois, where Senator Paul Simon, a Democrat, and Representative Lynn Martin, the Republican challenger for his Senate seat, are both claiming to be the friend of environmentalists.</p>
        <p>Ms. Martin received a 60 percent rating by the League of Conservation Voters for her House votes on environmental issues in 1989, while Mr. Simon scored 90 percent. But Ms. Martin insisted that her record was really the best because Mr. Simon voted against the recent Clean Air Bill in the Senate and she pledged to support it when it comes to a vote in the House.</p>
        <p>''It was the most important environmental vote of the decade,'' Ms. Martin said. ''I think it will be very hard for sincere environmental groups to talk about him having any kind of record.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Simon pointed out that he supported amendments to strengthen the bill but said he could not vote for its final passage because the legislation has a ''crass regional tilt'' that ''unfairly penalizes'' Illinois and other states that produce coal high in sulfur content.</p>
        <p>'A Jill-Come-Lately'</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the Sierra Club is still supporting Mr. Simon. ''Lynn Martin is a Jill-Come-Lately to the environment,'' the organization said in a news release. ''She has not been a champion of the environment during her tenure in Congress.''</p>
        <p>Responding to the Sierra Club remarks, Ms. Martin said: ''They prefer a Senator who voted against clean air? I doubt it.'' Representative Henry A. Waxman, a California Democrat who is a leading advocate of environmental legislation, said the public's longtime concern about the issue sharpened markedly after the oil spill a year ago in Valdez, Alaska, was brought home to television viewers with nightly pictures of animals covered with oil.</p>
        <p>''The issue has just moved higher up among those issues that people feel impatient and urgent about,'' Mr. Waxman said. ''The public's getting pretty fed up. People are saying we need to do more in this area.''</p>
        <p>It should be no surprise that public indignation is being felt on Capitol Hill, said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat. He told members of two environmental groups several days ago that his upset victory in 1988 over Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr., a Republican, proved their political strength.</p>
        <p>''I stand before you as the best example of what the green vote can do,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A Factor in New Jersey Race</p>
        <p>Strategists for Jim Florio, who defeated Representative Jim Courter to become Governor of New Jersey last year, say the Democratic winner's stand on the environment was a pivotal element in the race.</p>
        <p>''There was a lot of reporting about the abortion issue having a lot of say in that race, but I think the environment was just as important,'' said Robert Squier, whose company produced several television advertisements that ridiculed the environmental record of Mr. Courter, a Republican.</p>
        <p>Though not quite as incendiary an issue as abortion, the environment, too, transcends party lines. Of those who identified themselves as Democrats in the Times/CBS poll, 77 percent said the environment should be protected regardless of the cost; so did 69 percent of Republicans.</p>
        <p>But Democrats in Congress remain rated twice as high as Republicans in their votes on environmental issues, according to a study by the League of Conservation Voters, the lobbying group. This is a circumstance that Republicans are seeking to change.</p>
        <p>Senator Gordon J. Humphrey, a New Hampshire Republican who was elected in 1978, was for years regarded as a foe of the traditional environmentalists, conservations and young people. ''Their views seemed extreme,'' he said, recalling ''the era of the snail darter holding up construction of the Tellico Dam.''</p>
        <p>But after he had favorable experiences on issues of concern to environmentalists, Mr. Humphrey's views changed, and environmental groups now count on his support.</p>
        <p>''I could work with these groups,'' the Senator said he discovered. ''I wasn't quite so suspicious of them.''</p>
