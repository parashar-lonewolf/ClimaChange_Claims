        <p>COUNTY officials are preparing to comply with strict new Federal air-pollution standards that will sharply increase the cost of burning Westchester's garbage at the Charles Point plant here.</p>
        <p>The exact type of scrubbers and filters required will not be known until later this year. But county officials and the private owner of the plant, which is on county land, are about to begin negotiations to determine the financial effect on the majority of county taxpayers, who pay to use the plant through their refuse-district taxes.</p>
        <p>The standards established by the 1990 Clean Air Act will require the installation of an estimated $100 million in pollution-control equipment to reduce significantly the emission of several pollutants known to cause cancer and contribute to acid rain. Environmental Protection Administration officials say there are 380 municipal incinerators nationwide affected by the law.</p>
        <p>The county has nearly four years to meet the air-pollution standards, and comments expected from state regulatory officials are not due until September. But financial experts and engineers studying the problem say the financial issues are so complex and the expected renovations so extensive that meeting the four-year timetable will be difficult.</p>
        <p>In the last month, the County Board of Acquisition and Contract has authorized more than $300,000 to hire legal, financial and engineering consultants to find ways to limit cost increases for the 36 municipalities in the county that depend on the plant to burn their garbage.</p>
        <p>The consultants will also insure that the upgrading provides for "maximum environmental performance," said Robert J. Vranna, the county's Deputy Commissioner of Public Works. Modified, the plant should meet or exceed Federal guidelines, he said.</p>
        <p>Achieving those goals will depend on the outcome of negotiations that the consultants and county officials will conduct with the owner and operator of the plant, Wheelabrator Environmental Systems and its subsidiary, the Westchester County Refuse Energy System Corporation, or Resco.</p>
        <p>The Federal air-pollution standards will increase the cost of operating the plant by $25 a ton, Mr. Vranna said. But county taxpayers have some protection because of an unusual provision in the original contract, which took into account possible changes in environmental law and limited the county's liability for both the capital and operating costs of those changes to $2 a ton. A Warning About 'Negative Economics'</p>
        <p>But Mr. Vranna warned of what he called the "negative economics," or possible costs to taxpayers, that could occur if county negotiators did not reach an agreement with Resco operators on the terms of the required renovations. Because the county needs the cooperation of Resco and some concessions from the company, the situation, he said, is not so simple.</p>
        <p>Resco officials agree. "There are some tradeoffs to be made," said James F. Wood, senior vice president of Wheelabrator Environmental Systems, adding that "the county has some needs and so do we." Resolving the issues, he said, "is going to be a tough problem for us, but it's also going to be a tough problem for the county."</p>
        <p>Mr. Wood added, "A portion of the costs will have to be borne by the consumer and a portion by Wheelabrator."</p>
        <p>Among other considerations, Mr. Wood said, the county must find a place to dispose of large portions of the 2,000 tons of trash that the participating municipalities and private carters send to the plant daily. Renovations will take one of three burners at the plant out of service for a year each.</p>
        <p>Nearby landfills are no longer available, and Wheelabrator, Mr. Wood said, is the only company able to provide a nearby "home for Westchester's trash," at its Bridgeport plant. The county's need for an interim disposal site will be an important part of the negotiations, Mr. Wood said.</p>
        <p>The issue is a serious one, Mr. Vranna agreed. "Our major concern, of course, is how to handle the potential bypass waste when only two-thirds of the plant is operating," he said, adding that legal experts in the county are already reviewing the intermunicipal agreement to determine the extent to which the company is obligated to accept Westchester's trash and whether costs must go up.</p>
        <p>A financial-consulting team is already at work reviewing the possibilities for refinancing the $157 million in industrial-revenue bonds that the county sold to help finance the $243 million plant eight years ago. The refinancing would substantially lower interest rates, but it is unclear who should benefit -- municipal users or Resco. A decision must be made by July, when the bonds are due.</p>
        <p>"We want to see the savings reflected in the budgets of the solid-waste district," Mr. Vranna said, but he acknowledged that other stipulations in the contract guarantee the operator of the plant a yearly profit. Ultimately, Mr. Vranna said, "both of us are going to have to pay the consequences of the Clean Air Act."</p>
        <p>Under its contract with Resco, the county pays the company an artificially low rate of $22.40 a ton to burn the garbage supplied by its municipalities, is guaranteed 557,000 tons of capacity for that purpose, and charges municipal haulers $55 a ton to use the rest of the plant's capacity. The plant's permanent capacity is 657,000 tons a year.</p>
        <p>The trash-to-energy process uses extremely high temperatures, up to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit, to dispose of the combined municipal and commercial waste and produce enough steam for Consolidated Edison to provide electricity for 40,000 houses.</p>
        <p>The 20-year agreement, which expires in 2004, insures that participating municipalities will have a place to burn their garbage at a set rate, that the company will be assured of both a sufficient supply of solid waste and of a guaranteed yearly profit of $5 million, and that Westchester County and the company will divide any additional revenue according to an established formula.</p>
        <p>Revenues have been increasing as county-sponsored recycling programs divert larger proportions of municipal garbage from the plant, opening space to burn the commercially generated solid waste for which a higher rate is charged.</p>
        <p>Negotiators for both sides say they are determined to preserve the program, which has proved profitable for both the county and the company while offering municipalities low-cost disposal of their garbage. Two County Bills</p>
        <p>"We will resolve this to the mutual satisfaction and benefit of Westchester County and the company," Mr. Wood said. "There have to be winners on both sides." And Mr. Vranna said, "We are open and optimistic." But neither side would predict what shape the final agreement would take.</p>
        <p>Two bills now before the County Board of Legislators will have a significant impact on the use of the plant. On Sept. 1, the state will require all municipalities to demand that residences and businesses separate most items, including newspapers, plastics, corrugated cardboard and glass.</p>
        <p>One of the county bills calls for people who do not separate their trash to face financial penalties of $250 for the first offense up to $1,000 for repeated offenses. Officials hope these penalties will increase recycling efforts and reduce municipal volume at the Charles Point plant and reduce the costs of operating it.</p>
        <p>The county will open its Materials Recovery Facility, or "Murf," in Yonkers on Sept. 1. That plant will guarantee a market for all recycled materials sent there from the municipalities. The lack of available markets has slowed municipal recycling efforts.</p>
        <p>A second bill calls for licensing all commercial haulers in the county. If adopted, the licensing requirement would allow county inspectors to determine how much solid waste private haulers handle, where they dispose of it and how much is being recycled.</p>
        <p>With that information, the county will have a better understanding of the total volume of its solid waste and how to reduce it, Mr. Vranna said. Significant reductions, he said, will allow the county to avoid having to add a fourth burner at the Charles Point plant, a process that could cost as much as the construction of the three original burners combined because of inflation and the cost of the anti-pollution equipment.</p>
