        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Hawaii prides itself on the protection of its unique environment as we work to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. More than any other state, Hawaii is acutely dependent upon imported oil for the generation of electricity. But our small size and commitment to the visitor industry requires that we give special attention to ecological issues.</p>
        <p>For over a decade, our strategy has been to reduce reliance on imported oil by developing clean energy alternatives. We have made significant progress. Of the 393,000 households in Hawaii, 11 percent (45,000 homes) use solar water heaters. An impressive 48 percent of single-family homes use solar water heating systems, each of which saves an annual average of seven barrels of oil. In addition, 55,000 households use heat pump water heaters, each with an annual average savings of five barrels of oil. Hawaii's per capita use of these devices is more than that of any other state.</p>
        <p>We have other non-fossil fuel sources as well. Hawaii pioneered and proved to the world the technical feasibility of ocean thermal energy conversion, while Hawaii's famous trade winds drive wind turbines that produce electricity. Bagasse, the fibrous residue of the sugar cane harvest, was burned to provide 27 percent of the electricity sold by the utility on the Big Island of Hawaii in 1989. Renewable energy sources comprised 40 percent of the electricity produced on the Big Island last year.</p>
        <p>Now Hawaii is taking the first steps toward developing our geothermal resource. Modern geothermal technology is clean and efficient and will help reduce the amount of fossil fuel burned to create electricity. By bringing geothermal energy on-line, Hawaii will be participating in the fight against global atmospheric warming, called by some the greatest environmental threat facing humankind.</p>
        <p>Hawaii's rain forests are not ''imperiled'' by our careful approach to geothermal energy development. A 100-megawatt geothermal facility would require clearing about 300 acres of Class C (less pristine) lowland tropical rain forest. That's 1/2 percent of the 60,000 acres of forest in the vicinity. Hawaii will not imperil this wondrous asset. Safeguards exist to protect the integrity and survival of this rain forest and Hawaii's other rain forests. By word and deed, the State of Hawaii has demonstrated its commitment to protecting our fragile environment and limited natural assets.</p>
