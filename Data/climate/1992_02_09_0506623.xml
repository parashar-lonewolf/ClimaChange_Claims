        <p>ECONOMY Mr. Bush on Health Care</p>
        <p>You don't have to be a genius to figure out that something major is wrong with the health care system. It consumes a massive 13 percent of gross domestic product but leaves 35 million people without insurance. Last week, President Bush offered a plan to fix things up. Lightweight, said critics. The plan calls for cutting the waste out of Medicare and Medicaid, but doesn't specify how. It proposes a cap on malpractice awards, but doesn't say how much. It would provide vouchers worth up to $3,750 to poor families to buy insurance, but makes no assurance that that will be enough. "The plus is we've now got a mainstream consensus that the government must deal with health care," said Joseph Califano, former Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare. Consensus or not, he said, "there is no more chance of passing a major health care reform bill this year than of putting an elephant through a keyhole"  And Still, There Are No Jobs  The recovery's sails may be up, but no wind is blowing. This slump is now 18 months old with no signs of abating. That's especially true for jobs. According to the Labor Department, unemployment remained stuck at 7.1 percent in January, the same level as December and the highest rate since 1984. The results would have been even worse had 400,000 people who wanted full-time jobs not found part-time work. "Let's not kid ourselves. The economy is declining," said Allen Sinai, of the Boston Company. "The figures indicate negative G.D.P. in the first quarter of about 8 tenths of 1 percent. It's a rough bounce to the bottom."  The Ever-Adaptable Fed  Back when Cadillacs still had tail fins, Representative Wright Patman, the Texas populist, thought the Federal Reserve was too darn independent for the nation's good. It didn't give a hoot about economic growth, he said, only inflation. So Mr. Patman tried but failed to shut it down. If only he could see it now. With election fever gripping Washington and the bond market skittish, Fed chairman Alan Greenspan is talking like a politician. He said last week he was not opposed to lowering interest rates further if that was needed to lift the economy off the rocks. "Back in December Mr. Greenspan said no one will blame him for the loss of their office or for the loss of the White House," said Allan Meltzer, a professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University. "Then in January he said he'd ease rates enough to let the economy recover." That would even make Mr. Patman happy. Treasury's Short-Term Token  Economists call it the preferred-habitat argument. It's a fancy way of saying money moves where investors are best able to get the results they want. That's why depositors switch banks when terms and rates change. But the Treasury has decided to take on the theory. With short-term rates far lower than long-term rates, it said last week it would reduce the amount of 30-year bonds it sells to $10 billion from $12 billion and make up the difference with more 3-year and 10-year bonds. That would save it $55 million in interest payments. But will investors bite? "The original talk was of eliminating the 30-year bond," said Samuel D. Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities in Chicago. But the $2 billion shift "is just a token amount."  A Little Zip in Car Sales  After running on fumes for more than a year, Detroit finally has its pedal near the metal. Sales of domestically built cars and light trucks are still pretty flat -- but they rose 11.1 percent in late January.  Recession? Talk to Iraq  Last week, George Bush's economic advisers submitted the President's Annual Economic Report to Congress. The report said the sluggish economy would probably pick up a little steam in the next few months and finish the year 1.6 percent ahead of last year. But this year's report stepped a little further into the realm of politics than it usually does. If Congress follows the President's plans, growth will climb to 2.2 percent, it said. And the report chose its enemies carefully. Mr. Bush was not responsible for the recession. It was Saddam Hussein of Iraq who caused it. Had the Persian Gulf War not occurred, the economy would be purring. Perhaps that's why Mr. Bush sent Robert M. Gates, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, to the Mideast. Mr. Gates's mission, it is rumored, is to seek support for ousting Mr. Hussein. Priority to the Ozone  The greatest obstacles to speeding up the phase-out of ozone-depleting chemicals were a lack of scientific evidence and John H. Sununu, the former White House chief of staff. Mr. Sununu, of course, is gone, and last week new evidence was released that dangerous holes in the ozone layer were opening up over North America. That was enough for the White House. It now supports a Senate proposal to phase out the offending chemicals before the original goal of the year 2000. COMPANIES</p>
        <p>Federated Is Back  Too often, the next step after Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code is the corporate boneyard. But Federated Department Stores Inc., was able to avoid that final resting place. Last week it emerged after two years in court with an offering of 24 million shares of stock that were quickly snatched up by investors. Federated, owner of the Bloomingdale's, Abraham &amp; Strauss and Burdine retail chains, was the $10 billion pipe dream of Canadian developer Robert Campeau. Federated shed 42 stores (it still has 223) and worked out a deal for banks, bondholders and suppliers to forgive about $3 billion in debt in exchange for about $2 billion in Federated stock.  Ringing It Up in Video Rentals  One industry has been doing nicely in this recession, thank you very much. Video rentals. According to Alexander &amp; Associates, an industry consultant, movie rentals are at an all-time high -- 106.6 million of them were checked out in the first week of January -- a record. How many of those rentals, do you suppose, were returned rewound?  NBC Nods Off on Thursday  More people veg out watching TV on Thursday night than any other night. That means money for the networks -- especially NBC, which dominated the evening with shows like "Cheers," "Cosby" and "L.A. Law." But these shows are getting, well, tired. Last week "Cheers," NBC's highest-rated show, slipped to fourth place from first. "Cosby" and "L.A. Law," fell as well, prompting some critics to wonder what the peacock is up to.  "It's sliding," said Jib Fowles, author of "Why Viewers Watch." As he said, "G.E., NBC's parent, doesn't understand TV." NBC should freshen up its lineup, he said.  When the Sony Corporation bought Columbia Pictures and Tri star, and Matsushita Electric Industrial Company bought Universal, critics asked whether these studios would be free to portray Japanese culture as they wished. "No problem," said the acquirers. But then "Hell Camp," a Tristar film about Americans living in Japan was cancelled. Rumors spread through Hollywood that it was killed due to pressure on Sony from Japan's Sumo Association which did not like the way its sport would be portrayed. Tristar denied it. It stopped the project on its own, it said. "Any suggestions that the Sony Corporation has interfered in the creative process or any other aspect of 'Hell Camp' or any other Tristar Pictures project is simply wrong," said Mike Medavoy, chairman of Tristar. Last year, "Mr. Baseball," produced by Universal, about an American living in Japan, had its script rewritten to portray the Japanese in a more favorable light. Criticism flared, but Universal said it had not been pressured by Tokyo.  Unbundling Over Optima  The American Express Company once could do no wrong. Then it brought out the Optima Card. Profits at its travel related division dropped 59 percent. It was forced to set aside $265 million against defaults on the credit card. To raise cash, American Express announced last week it was selling off up to 45 percent of its Information Services Corporation, which processess Visa and Mastercard as well as its own cards. Analysts thought the offering might raise up to $800 million for Amex. Is Amex hurting? "This is selling the silverware," said John Keefe, an analyst at Lipper Analytical Services, "They're not really starving for capital at this point, but they're getting a little hungry."  INTERNATIONAL</p>
        <p>What's With the Slurs?  Japan is known as a nation that values harmony -- which it calls</p>
        <p>wa</p>
        <p>-- in all of its business relations. Politeness is a high form of art. But apparently that does not carry over into its relations with the United States. It seems that Japan's most important politicians are lining up to call Americans, well, lazy. Last month, it was Yoshio Sakurauchi, speaker of the lower house of Parliament, who said Americans were lazy. Then, last week, it was Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, who said Americans "may lack the work ethic," which was, after all, another way of saying Americans are lazy. True, Americans work a few hours less each week than the Japanese do, but the Japanse Labor Ministry itself says Americans are still a tad more productive. Not only that, but the evidence is that the Japanese themselves, if not becoming exactly lazy, are slowly lightening up. Japanese workers are putting in one hour less each week than they did 10 years ago. Mazda in the U.S.A.  For the first time, the Mazda Motor Corporation will be assembling a car in the United State that has enough American content to be classified as a domestic make. The car -- a new 626 model -- has 75 percent of its parts coming from companies operating in the United States. Its glass, paint, tires and electronics are all made here -- some by American companies, some by Japanese transplants operating in the United States. The only parts that are imported from Japan are the engine and transmission. In other words, the most expensive parts. A Dinosaur Named Cocom  America's cold war policy was based on the idea of containment. Keep the Soviet Union huddled within its borders and away from the West's high-tech goodies. To keep Moscow away from such exotica as Macintosh computers and old-fashioned PC's -- the Paris-based Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls was set up. Its members include America's World War II allies (except the Soviet Union, of course) plus Germany and Japan. But is Cocom still needed? Most of corporate America doesn't think so. Neither does much of Europe. Last week, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy introduced a proposal aimed at removing most products from Cocom's list. "The cold war is over," said Eric L. Hirschorn, a lawyer who represents American computer makers. "Why is is over everywhere but in Cocom?"</p>
