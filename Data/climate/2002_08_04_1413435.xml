      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial on Powder River Basin, where Bush administration wants to sink 51,000 coal bed methane wells in Wyoming and 26,000 more in Montana, to extract some 25 trillion cubic feet of methane gas, or slightly more than nation consumes in year; explains environmental concerns; says Interior Department and Bureau of Land Management are not reassuring, noting criticism from Bush's own EPA</p>

        <p>The Powder River Basin in Wyoming and Montana may appear unprepossessing to people whose idea of the West is the peaks of Grand Teton National Park. It is a windswept, grassy landscape, pure ranch country, with a subtle beauty all its own. The basin now finds itself at the epicenter of a larger national struggle between the country's energy needs and its environmental values, between a Bush administration that is determined to drill for oil and gas and the conservationists and ranchers who are equally determined to protect their vulnerable and increasingly threatened landscape.</p>
        <p>The administration's plans for the basin are breathtakingly ambitious. It aims to sink 51,000 coal bed methane wells in Wyoming over 10 years, and 26,000 more in Montana. The prize is roughly 25 trillion cubic feet of methane gas, a form of natural gas -- slightly more than the nation consumes in one year. Coal bed methane was a big component of the Bush-Cheney energy strategy even before the Senate defeated President Bush's proposal to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. As fossil fuels go, it is relatively clean burning. But there's nothing clean about extracting it.</p>

        <p>The Powder River Basin in Wyoming and Montana may appear unprepossessing to people whose idea of the West is the peaks of Grand Teton National Park. It is a windswept, grassy landscape, pure ranch country, with a subtle beauty all its own. The basin now finds itself at the epicenter of a larger national struggle between the country's energy needs and its environmental values, between a Bush administration that is determined to drill for oil and gas and the conservationists and ranchers who are equally determined to protect their vulnerable and increasingly threatened landscape.</p>
        <p>The administration's plans for the basin are breathtakingly ambitious. It aims to sink 51,000 coal bed methane wells in Wyoming over 10 years, and 26,000 more in Montana. The prize is roughly 25 trillion cubic feet of methane gas, a form of natural gas -- slightly more than the nation consumes in one year. Coal bed methane was a big component of the Bush-Cheney energy strategy even before the Senate defeated President Bush's proposal to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. As fossil fuels go, it is relatively clean burning. But there's nothing clean about extracting it.</p>
        <p>For starters, to free the gas, huge quantities of water must be pumped from the coal seam. At the surface, the gas is collected in compressor stations that roar like jet engines 24 hours a day, then piped away. The water is dumped in streams and ditches. In a semi-arid region like the Powder River Basin, extra water might seem like a boon, except for two things. The high salt content renders much of the water unfit for irrigation. And the pumping depletes underground aquifers, threatening the agricultural future of the region.</p>
        <p>There are other costs. Environmentalists say that in Wyoming alone, the plan would require 17,000 miles of new roads, 20,000 miles of pipeline, 200 large compressors and nearly 5,000 containment pits for the water. The 12,000 wells already developed in the basin have left scars on the landscape. One can only imagine the damage from 77,000 new wells.</p>
        <p>The sheer invasiveness of methane development has created unusual alliances, alienating not only environmentalists but also bedrock Republican ranchers of the sort the White House takes for granted. The ranchers who do not own the mineral rights under their property have discovered they can't say no when the drillers come knocking at their door.</p>
        <p>Partly because it has already been violated, the basin does not fall into the ''too wild to drill'' category -- places like Montana's Rocky Mountain Front or Wyoming's Bridger-Teton National Forest -- that the Wilderness Society and other groups have asked the administration to avoid altogether. Even ardent conservationists agree that further energy development in the basin is bound to occur.</p>
        <p>What they insist on, however, is a responsible approach to drilling. And on this score the Interior Department and its Bureau of Land Management, which developed the plan, have not been reassuring. In April, Mr. Bush's own Environmental Protection Agency, required by law to review such projects, found the bureau's draft environmental impact statement inadequate and warned that without new safeguards the project would cause unacceptable environmental damage. This ruling, coupled with other unfavorable legal verdicts, has given the critics breathing room while sending the administration a clear signal to get its house in order.</p>
        <p>The question is whether it will. The pressures on the Interior Department to proceed with vigorous exploration are fierce. In addition, a key player in this debate -- Steven Griles, the department's deputy secretary -- is a former lobbyist for the coal bed methane industry.</p>
        <p>The Bureau of Land Management says it is working with the E.P.A. to address its concerns. But mere tinkering will not do. The project needs a thorough overhaul. Drilling must proceed at an orderly pace, the best available technology must be deployed at every turn, and damage to private ranchland must be fully repaired at industry expense. Above all, ways must be found to save the water. Water, not methane, is the lifeblood of the region.</p>
