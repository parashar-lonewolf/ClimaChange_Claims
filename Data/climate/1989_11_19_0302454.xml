        <p>LEAD: JULIE D. BELAGA of Westport, a Republican who lost her bid for governor in 1986, has been appointed Region 1 administrator for the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the Government's top environmental post in New England with a staff of 575 people and offices in Boston.</p>
        <p>JULIE D. BELAGA of Westport, a Republican who lost her bid for governor in 1986, has been appointed Region 1 administrator for the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the Government's top environmental post in New England with a staff of 575 people and offices in Boston.</p>
        <p>The office has an annual budget of $365 million to enforce the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts and supervise sewer repair and Superfund cleanup programs in the six New England states.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Belaga, who is 59 years old, grew up in Boston, graduated from Syracuse University, and settled in Connecticut in 1965. She represented Westport in the State House of Representatives from 1976 to 1986, and was involved in issues of coastal protection, transportation of hazardous waste and solid-waste mangement. After her unsuccessful gubernatorial campaign, she worked as a commentator for WTNH-TV in New Haven and as an instructor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. Her new job will pay $78,600 a year.</p>
        <p>In an interview at her home, Mrs. Belaga talked about environmental issues but stressed that she was basing her remarks on her experience in the Connecticut legislature, since until her appointment is confirmed, probably early next year,she said she could not speak for the Environmental Protection Agency. Here are some excerpts from the conversation:</p>
        <p>Q. Acid rain and low-level ozone are two problems Connecticut has but blames on the coal-burning plants of the Midwest and the industrial emissions of the New York metropolitan area. Should the E.P.A. be taking more of a regional perspective, rather than requiring cleanup state by state?</p>
        <p>A. Frankly, one of the things I look forward to is meeting the other regional administrators, particularly from our neighboring regions. Pollution knows no political boundaries. And it's the same for clean water.</p>
        <p>Cleaning up Long Island Sound is a major initiative, and it's something I've cared about since 1975 when Gov. Ella Grasso appointed me to a coastal area management task force.</p>
        <p>You look at what's happening in Long Island Sound, and a lot of it is stuff coming down from the Connecticut River, and not all of that is from Connecticut. It's a very large regional issue. There are some close ties to our neighbors and some tough questions to address.</p>
        <p>I can remember going to a legislative conference for the Northeast and wondering how anybody could not be tuned into acid rain, and then I met people from Pennsylvania who were coal miners and who have a lot of jobs at stake, and you begin to see the dynamics of some of these very difficult issues.</p>
        <p>Q. For companies that say they cannot afford the best pollution control, should economics play a role in environmental issues?</p>
        <p>A. I think what we need to do, as we move forward now that the public is with us, is to work cooperatively with business, to explain to them how they can meet these standards. I don't think we are really well served by a confrontational mode, and that's never been my style. I really believe in conciliation, and the only way we're ever going to make inroads on environmental issues is to make the environmental community and businesses friends and not enemies.</p>
        <p>That doesn't mean I don't support tough enforcement, because that sends a message that we're serious about this, that there is a law and if you don't comply with that law, we're going to hold you accountable. But a lot of businesses get a bad rap because of one or two that are really grossly violating, and many businesses want to be good environmentally; they want to be good neighbors. I think they need to know there is an open door, that we look forward to working with them.</p>
        <p>Q. Are people too concerned about environmental issues?</p>
        <p>A. No, I don't think anyone is. But I can't tell you how wonderful it is that the public cares, because for a long time they didn't. In 1986 when I ran for governor I did a poll, and only 4 percent of the people in Connecticut cared about the environment. I was told, ''Julie, don't talk about those issues if nobody cares.'' Recently, there was a poll done and it ranked crime, drugs and the environment as the top problems.</p>
        <p>This is a prime time to be an environmentalist, because the public cares. They're aware. They're willing to support an environmental initiative. It's a whole new mood now. There's a whole sense out there that ''Hey, let's do it.''</p>
        <p>Q. A lot of business owners say that more harm is done to the environment by homeowners' dumping of paints and thinners into sewer systems or automobile drain oil into storm drains than by industrial effluents. How serious is that dumping?</p>
        <p>A. I don't think it's ever a valid argument that ''I should be able to get away with it because someone else is getting away with it, too.'' I do think we can beef up and expand our program of household hazardous waste disposal. Nobody knew that stuff was dangerous. Everybody's going to have to pitch in, to play a role, but the thing is, now people care.</p>
        <p>One of the things I did on television a couple of months ago was a piece on disposable diapers. I can remember when they were invented, and they were a nice little convenience. Now, we have this enormous problem in our landfills. A lot of young people were not aware of the long-term implications of filling our landfills with them. And a lot of them are rethinking the situation.</p>
        <p>Q. With landfills filling up all over the country, why didn't the Federal Government take more of an initiative on recycling and source reduction?</p>
        <p>A. I think you're going to see that. A very vital component of all our environmental concerns is going to have to be prevention. It's a lot cheaper to prevent it in the first place than to clean it up after it happens.</p>
        <p>Q. In the 1960's everyone was convinced that landfills were the way to go. Now, we find that that contaminates ground water. Can environmental protection be effective when we know so little about the environment?</p>
        <p>A. That's the nature of science. We're always trying to find some better way to skin that cat. Yes, we are going to find a downside, but because you make a goof, you don't just stop. What's fun about public policy is that it's a living, breathing thing, and it changes and you have to change along with it and learn with it.</p>
        <p>I met with a woman in Washington last week who said environmental issues are becoming so complex and so technical and so highly refined that it's becoming more and more difficult to get people to work in the field for what the Government is willing to pay. There are a lot of talented people working in Boston who don't get a lot of satisfaction salary-wise, but they are dedicated, talented environmentalists.</p>
        <p>That's going to be part of my challenge, to make sure those people feel good about what they do.</p>
        <p>Q. A lot of attention has been paid recently to radon. As many as 10 percent of houses in some Connecticut towns have a problem. Is this something the E.P.A. should be taking the lead on?</p>
        <p>A. That's a problem people have not been tuned into heavily. It is an enormous problem, a very high health risk, but it has been an invisible issue. What you will certainly see coming out of the E.P.A. is education of the public of how they can deal with this question and how they should protect themselves.</p>
        <p>The numbers of people exposed to it are far larger than we expected. We now have a whole new problem. When I was at the legislature no one even knew about it.</p>
        <p>Q. At a regional level, is there anything we can be doing about global problems like the greenhouse effect and the thinning of the ozone layer?</p>
        <p>A. I am assuming there will be some interesting give and take between the environmentalists and the administrator in Washington and his counterparts internationally. Candidly, my role is going to be more regional, and I only look to have some input, through my conversations with the administrator as these national decisions are made.</p>
        <p>Q What in your experience prepared you for this job?</p>
        <p>A. I think the reason I was tapped as a viable candidate was because I have a unique array of experiences. My legislative involvement in environmental issues is right at the top of the list, but also simply understanding the process, understanding how government functions at the state level and, going back a few years, at the local level, has helped. More and more Federal initiatives are being implemented at the state and local level.</p>
        <p>Q. What does this job mean in terms of your future in Connecticut politics?</p>
        <p>A. Connecticut sure hasn't lost me. There is no way I would leave Connecticut. I will be commuting. I have family who live in Boston, so I will live with my family during the week and come back to Connecticut on weekends. But I would venture to say that it's highly unlikely I would ever run for office again.</p>
        <p>This job is so tailor-made for my particular interests, but it is a very controversial seat to sit in. It tends not to be a stepping stone for political office.</p>
