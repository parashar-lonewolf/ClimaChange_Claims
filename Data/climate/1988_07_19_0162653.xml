        <p>LEAD: Almost the entire country, from California to Cape Cod, is roasting in scorching heat because of an unusual set of meteorological conditions brought on by the spread of a vast vortex of high-pressure air. This has expanded from the Middle West, where it has persisted for a sweltering month, all across the northern United States.</p>
        <p>Almost the entire country, from California to Cape Cod, is roasting in scorching heat because of an unusual set of meteorological conditions brought on by the spread of a vast vortex of high-pressure air. This has expanded from the Middle West, where it has persisted for a sweltering month, all across the northern United States.</p>
        <p>Government meteorologists said yesterday that the dense air in the upper atmosphere has grown into an unusual elongated pattern from coast to coast. They said it was highly unusual for the nation's weather to be influenced so uniformly by one such pervasive condition.</p>
        <p>Scientists who specialize in climate trends said the current weather patterns could have occurred without any increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere adding to a global effect whereby heat is trapped in the atmosphere by polluting gases, as if by a greenhouse. But they said the rise in such gases could lead to more hotter-than-average summers in the future.</p>
        <p>Dr. James Firor, a climatologist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., said: ''If the greenhouse gases continue to increase, and they seem to be going up, then the probability of heat waves could go up. The weather will continue to fluctuate, but even a slight rise in the average global temperature could mean the hot summers will be hotter and probably more frequent and the low temperatures won't get quite as low.''</p>
        <p>And even stringent measures to reduce the air pollution responsible for the greenhouse effect can only buy time to adjust to a warmer world, many scientists around the world now agree.  [ Science Times, page C1. ]  These were some of the weather highs reported yesterday: Sacramento, Calif., 107 degrees; Dallas-Fort Worth, 102; Las Vegas, Nev., 110; Shreveport, La., 100; Washington, 93, and New York City, 96.</p>
        <p>At the National Weather Service's Climate Analysis Center in Suitland, Md., meteorologists said unusually high pressures in the upper atmosphere began heating up much of the country in early June. The jet stream, a strong west-east current in the upper atmosphere, had remained farther north than usual, preventing the flow of cooler air out of Canada.</p>
        <p>''These are chicken-and-egg situations,'' said Edward O'Lenic, a meteorologist at the Climate Analysis Center. ''It's hard to say which came first, the high-pressure center or the strong jet stream. But the high pressures became very persistent and have set up the conditions for the current heat wave.''</p>
        <p>For a few days in June, Mr. O'Lenic said, the layer of dense air, at about 20,000 feet, extended from the northern Plains to New England, causing the first widespread hot weather of the season. Then the high-pressure air contracted to the Middle West, and has scarcely budged until the last three days. Its center might shift from North Dakota to the Great Lakes and back, but the result was invariably the hot dry weather that has beaten down crops and people. Wheel of Rotating Air</p>
        <p>''Usually these high-pressure areas remain in the same place no more than a week or two,'' Mr. O'Lenic said. ''This one is in a different class.'' Such a high-pressure area is like a wheel of air rotating clockwise. The motion, when especially strong and moving outward, can act to fend off weather forces that come close.</p>
        <p>In this case, the ''anomalous high'' over the Middle West was too strong for the subtropical high, often called the Bermuda high, that moved across the Southeastern United States this summer, as usual. The Bermuda high brings in hot, moist air, which produces summer thunderstorms and ordinarily circulates moisture into the Middle West and the northern Plains. But the moisture has largely remained stalled in the Gulf states.</p>
        <p>When such a high-pressure area establishes itself, the meteorologist said, it tends to create conditions that help perpetuate its existence. The dynamics of the clockwise air circulation strengthen the jet stream to the north, which acts as a barrier to cooler air from Canada. And as long as there is no incoming cool air from the north or moisture from the south, the land beneath the dense upper atmosphere becomes hotter and drier, making matters worse.</p>
        <p>By Sunday, the anomalous high-pressure layer in the upper atmosphere had stretched across the northern United States. One center of especially high pressure was over California, just north of San Francisco, which experienced the highest temperatures on record. The other pressure center was over lower Michigan. But the influence spread heat and humidity east to the hills of Vermont and Maine, south to Tennessee and Kentucky as well as west to California.</p>
        <p>In a forecast yesterday, the National Weather Service said the elongated pressure high would break up in a few days into eastern and western fragments. This was expected to bring thunderstorms and slightly lower temperatures to much of the hot, parched heart of the country. The East was expected to begin cooling off in a few days, and then the West Coast. But above-normal temperatures will continue in the eastern and northern Rockies.</p>
