        <p>LEAD: The Republic has survived this long without a national insect, but Congress can't rest. Representative Leon Panetta of California is floating the monarch butterfly's candidacy.

        <p>The Republic has survived this long without a national insect, but Congress can't rest. Representative Leon Panetta of California is floating the monarch butterfly's candidacy. Senator Larry Pressler of South Dakota favors the honeybee. It does not take long to resolve this issue.</p>
        <p>For two weighty reasons - defense and politics - the bee is quite unacceptable. Any year now, a savage race of Africanized killer bees will swarm up from Mexico and devastate the tranquil American honeybee. Meanwhile a tiny Asian mite, Varrona jacobsoni to entomologists, is creeping down from the north and infiltrating defenseless bee colonies. To choose an insect champion just before it's crushed between the pincers of foreign invaders will do nothing for national pride.</p>
        <p>The honeybee's political arrangements also leave much to be desired. Bees put community ahead of individual. They cooperate on the basis of equality. They work too hard. They save a lot of nectar and invest abundantly in honey reserves - much like the Japanese. They have workers but no private property. They probably have universal health insurance. Frankly, these are socialist insects. No way is Congress going to declare this busybody, communal arthropod the national bug.</p>
        <p>The monarch butterfly has none of the bee's unreliable instincts. Its defenses are almost foolproof - it's an ardent practitioner of biological warfare. As a caterpillar it stuffs its tissues with poisonous chemicals from its foodplant, the milkweed. For would-be predators, one peck is enough: the monarch is utterly distasteful.</p>
        <p>The butterfly's other distinctive trait is that it lives for the moment. It saves nothing. It does not educate its children. It dribbles poison at the idea of planning in any form. National energy policy? Avert global warming? The monarch gives not one flick of its gaudy wings for such unpleasant thoughts. It knows, as a matter of transcendental truth, that the morrow will provide.</p>
        <p>Droning on about the providence and husbandry of the bee, Senator Pressler, is a lost cause. Consumption is the value unanimously saluted by economists, voters and many politicians. The monarch already is the national insect.</p>
