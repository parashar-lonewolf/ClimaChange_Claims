        <p>RECYCLING has moved into the same league as motherhood, the flag and apple pie. A poll taken last year by the Roper Organization found that 74 percent of those who answered favored mandatory recycling to ease environmental problems.</p>
        <p>But solid-waste disposal problems vary widely across the country. Embracing one disposal method over others may increase costs without necessarily providing environmental benefits.</p>
        <p>It is certainly true that when thrown-away materials are recovered and turned into new products, there are several benefits. Obviously, that much less material is going to overburdened landfills. Re-use also eliminates the need to mine or harvest virgin materials, and since reprocessing usually involves less pollution than extraction and refining, the earth benefits in this way as well.</p>
        <p>Some materials, largely metals, have been recovered for years. A sophisticated network of dealers and processors collects the steel in old cars and industrial projects and sells it to mills as a raw material. Aluminum-can makers have promoted the re-use of beverage containers because they save vastly on electricity consumption, compared to using raw ore.</p>
        <p>But other materials have not fared so well. Old newspapers have piled up for lack of equipment to de-ink and repulp them into new paper. Plastics come in a multiplicity of chemical formulations, which must be separated to be of much use. Markets for most recycled plastics have been slow to develop as well.</p>
        <p>To promote recycling, 38 states have enacted a variety of product bans, mandates, taxes and tax incentives. Now, with the Federal law that governs solid waste, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, due for reauthorization, some environmentalists are pushing for national standards. They would insist that a broad variety of materials and products contain a certain percentage of material recycled from trash bins.</p>
        <p>But many economists argue that such rules would be wrong. Recycling may make economic sense in highly populated areas where landfill fees have been rising. But in some parts of the country, landfill space is abundant and cheap, and reprocessing plants are nonexistent. These people would be better off dumping and using the money saved for other worthy purposes, if there is no threat to the environment.</p>
        <p>"Mandated recycling in some circumstances would make sense if conserving landfill space were the only policy goal," wrote Lynn Scarlett, of the conservative Reason Foundation, in a study on solid waste. "But such efforts may consume more overall resources (environmental and commercial) than if waste were simply landfilled."</p>
        <p>Still, environmental groups see a Federal mandate as essential to develop recycling industries. "For more than 20 years, environmentalists have sought such a mandate on the grounds that recycling conserves resources, saves energy and is fiscally prudent," said Allen Hershkowitz, a scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council.</p>
        <p>An effort to reconcile the two positions is included in a report, "Project 88-Round 2," drafted by Robert N. Stavins, a professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. The report is significant because its predecessor, issued in 1988 at the behest of Senators Timothy E. Wirth and John Heinz, had an important influence on the Clean Air Act passed last year.</p>
        <p>The Clean Air Act allows generators of acid rain gases to trade credits, allowing the emission of a certain amount of pollutants. This is intended to encourage the company that can curb pollution at the least cost to do so and sell its credits to companies where cleanup costs would be higher. The argument is that this is the lowest-cost approach to reducing the desired amount of pollution.</p>
        <p>The current report would take a similar approach, using tradable permits as part of a general trend toward using market techniques to achieve environmental goals. "Under such a system," the report says, "the Federal Government could set an industrywide recycling rate (or recycled content standard) which individual firms could meet in one of two ways: they could use the required percentage of secondary materials or they could use fewer secondary materials and buy permits from other firms which exceed their recycling requirements."</p>
        <p>This approach would increase the demand, and presumably the price, of recycled materials without forcing companies that are unable to use them to make expensive alterations to their production processes.</p>
        <p>As markets for recycled materials develop, generators of solid waste will have to do some calculations. Do the prices being offered justify the cost of collection and separation, minus the cost of dumping in a fully approved, environmentally sound landfill? For some, the answer will be to recycle. But for others, dumping will make more sense.</p>
