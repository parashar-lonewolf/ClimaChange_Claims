        <p>LEAD: After months of uncertainty and tension, Canada and the United States are within reach of a ''historic'' trade agreement that would eliminate most tariff and non-tariff barriers between the two nations over 10 to 15 years, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney has concluded.</p>
        <p>After months of uncertainty and tension, Canada and the United States are within reach of a ''historic'' trade agreement that would eliminate most tariff and non-tariff barriers between the two nations over 10 to 15 years, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney has concluded.</p>
        <p>''I think we are going to have an agreement that will be good for both countries, and I'm going to run on it and get re-elected,'' Mr. Mulroney told a group of reporters from the United States Wednesday.</p>
        <p>President Reagan is scheduled to arrive here on Sunday for two days of talks that are expected to focus on trade, acid rain and Canadian demands for United States recognition of Canada's sovereignty over the Northwest Passage. Trade Talks 'Galvanized'</p>
        <p>The 47-year-old Prime Minister said that the ''availability'' of a trade agreement now, after serious doubts as recently as two months ago, owed much to Mr. Reagan's ''rebound'' from health problems and distractions of the Iran-contra affair.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reagan's decision to ''galvanize'' the trade talks, after an appeal from Mr. Mulroney in January, had moved negotiations substantially forward, the Prime Minister said. This, and Mr. Reagan's decision to ask Congress for $2.5 billion over five years for research into acid rain, had eased anxieties here that the President would be too involved with the Iran-contra affair to deal with the concerns of the United States' major allies, Mr. Mulroney said.</p>
        <p>''Like other prime ministers around the world,'' Mr. Mulroney said, ''I was saying to myself, 'When are these problems that are pretty important to me going to be attended to?' '' He said his answer came in a telephone call from Mr. Reagan while the Canadian leader was on a visit to Zimbabwe in late January. The President told him that the United States was going to make a major effort to complete the trade agreement.</p>
        <p>''What is available here is a liberalized trading arrangement that could serve as a model for the rest of the world,.'' the Prime Minister said. Halting Trade 'Fratricide'</p>
        <p>Mr. Mulroney said the agreement would show the world that the United States was prepared to take the lead in halting the ''fratricide'' that had marked recent international trading patterns. As a example, he cited the Reagan Administration's decision last week to levy up to $300 million of special duties on Japanese electronic imports in retaliation for what it said were Japanese violations of a semiconductor export agreement.</p>
        <p>However, the Prime Minister faces resistance to a broad trade agreement from opposition political parties, organized labor and other groups concerned about Canada's economic independence, and he said there were several ''vital'' conditions the pact would have to meet.</p>
        <p>Most important among these, Mr. Mulroney said, is that Canada must be permanently exempt from the United States' fair-trading laws, which are used to protect American industries and restrict imports.</p>
