        <p>Article on scaling back by demographers of estimates of world population growth; United Nations demographers, who predicted a few decades ago that earth's population would peak at 12 billion, now say it will peak at 10 billion before 2200 and then begin declining; fertility rates are dropping faster than predicted toward replacement level in poor countries as well as in many industrialized and middle-income countries; global population is aging as births fall and lives are extended, with over 80 age group growing the fastest; graphs (Special Report: Managing Planet Earth) (M)</p>

        <p>Demography has never been an exact science.

        <p>The world's population is leveling off far more quickly than experts ever predicted. But increased consumption may make population progress moot.</p>

        <p>Demography has never been an exact science. Ever since social thinkers began trying to predict the pace of population growth a century or two ago, the people being counted have been surprising the experts and confounding projections. Today, it is happening again as stunned demographers watch birthrates plunge in ways they never expected.</p>
        <p>Only a few years ago, some experts argued that economic development and education for women were necessary precursors for declines in population growth. Today, village women and slum families in some of the poorest countries are beginning to prove them wrong, as fertility rates drop faster than predicted toward the replacement level -- 2.1 children for the average mother, one baby to replace each parent, plus a fraction to compensate for unexpected deaths in the overall population.</p>
        <p>A few decades ago in certain countries like Brazil, Egypt, India and Mexico fertility rates were as high as five or six.</p>
        <p>As a result, United Nations demographers who once predicted the earth's population would peak at 12 billion over the next century or two are scaling back their estimates. Instead, they cautiously predict, the world's population will peak at 10 billion before 2200, when it may begin declining.</p>
        <p>Some experts are wary of too much optimism, however. At the Population Council, an independent research organization in New York, Dr. John Bongaarts has studied population declines in various countries over the last half century. He questions the assumption that when fertility declines begin they will continue to go down at the same pace, especially if good family planning services are not widely available.</p>
        <p>Sharp fertility declines in many industrialized and middle-income countries had already challenged another old belief: that culture and religion would thwart efforts to cut fertility. In Italy, a Roman Catholic country whose big families were the stuff of cinema, family size is shrinking faster than anywhere else in Europe, and the population is aging rapidly as fewer children are born. Islamic Iran has also had great success with family planning.</p>
        <p>''Projections aren't terribly accurate over the long haul,'' said Dr. Nicholas Eberstadt, a demography expert at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. ''Demographers have been surprised by just about every big fertility change in the modern period. Demographers didn't anticipate the baby boom. They did not anticipate the subsequent decline in fertility in industrialized Western democracies.''</p>
        <p>What's next? Demographers can agree generally on a few measurable facts and some trends. The world's population, now 6.2 billion, quadrupled in the 20th century, and changed in drastic ways. In 1900, 86 percent of the world's people lived in rural areas and about 14 percent in urban areas. By 2000, urban communities were home to 47 percent of the population, with 53 percent still in the countryside.</p>
        <p>Between now and 2030, when the global population is expected to reach about eight billion, almost all the growth will be in cities. But urbanization is not necessarily a bad thing for the environment, said Dr. Joseph Chamie, director of the United Nations' population division.</p>
        <p>''Moving to cities frees up the land for forestry, agriculture and many other activities,'' Dr. Chamie said. ''You're getting people concentrated, so you can probably recycle more easily. People change their lifestyles. The Indian moving from the boonies of Uttar Pradesh to the city of Lucknow gets educational opportunities, cultural opportunities, all sorts of political participation. He can be influenced by advertising and public relations campaigns. Immunization will be better, and family planning.''</p>
        <p>As births fall and lives are extended, the global population is getting older. The over-80 age group is the fastest growing.</p>
        <p>But not everywhere. For example, the United Nations calculates that life expectancy at birth is being slashed in countries hardest hit by AIDS. In South Africa, the life of a baby born now should be 66 years; AIDS has cut that to 47. In Zimbabwe, the drop has been to 43 years from 69. In Botswana, it is 36 years, down from 70.</p>
        <p>Another cautionary sign from projections is that where populations are continuing to grow fastest, societies and governments may be least likely to cope with the results, including strains on natural resources -- farmland, water, air, forests and animals.</p>
        <p>Last year, the organization published a report and wall chart, ''Population, Environment and Development,'' plotting and analyzing population changes as its contribution to the debate surrounding the Johannesburg summit meeting.</p>
        <p>The United Nations estimates that the world's current population, 6.2 billion, is growing at an annual rate slightly over 1.2 percent, producing some 77 million people. Of this growth, 97 percent is taking place in less-developed countries, said Dr. Chamie, whose position at the United Nations makes him chief keeper of the world's statistics. Six nations will dominate this growth, and in this order: India, China, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh and Indonesia.</p>
        <p>Thus, though fertility is declining unexpectedly in a poor country like India, which has more than a billion people, the actual numbers continue to rise rapidly because the base is so large. India is gaining as many people annually as China, Pakistan and Nigeria combined, the United Nations says.</p>
        <p>India is projected to have at least 100 million more people than China by 2050, even if China's one-child policy is relaxed. Small families are now the norm for the Chinese, whose standard of living has risen above that of the people of India by many measures.</p>
        <p>Among industrialized countries, the United States alone has a growth rate comparable to that of developing nations. It now ranks seventh in growth, Dr. Chamie said, but 80 percent of that growth comes from immigration. In Europe, populations are shrinking, even with more immigration.</p>
        <p>With much of the population bulge predicted in Asia, the East-West Center in Honolulu has just published a report, ''The Future of Population in Asia,'' which finds cause to fear considerable environmental stress in a region where population densities and numbers are often great. Asia, the report notes, already has 56 percent of the world's population living on 31 percent of its arable land, and more than 900 million people exist on less than $1 a day.</p>
        <p>''Asia faces the most acute pressure on arable agricultural land of any region in the world,'' the report says, adding that expansion of farmland has been made at the cost of forests. Acute water scarcity, a significant loss of biodiversity and more urban pollution seem inevitable. Twelve of the world's 15 most polluted cities are in Asia. By 2020, the report predicts, Asia will be producing more carbon dioxide emissions than any other region.</p>
        <p>''When looking at current and future environmental concerns in Asia,'' the report concludes, ''the number of people to be fed, clothed, housed, transported, educated and employed may not be the only issue, but it is an issue that cannot be ignored.''</p>
