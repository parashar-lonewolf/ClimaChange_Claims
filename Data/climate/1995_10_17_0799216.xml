        <p>For the first time since the end of the cold war, a Russian high-altitude spy plane has been put at the disposal of Western European scientists, who will use  it to study depletion of the protective ozone layer over Arctic regions.</p>
        <p>The European Science Foundation announced this month that Russia would provide a specially modified Myasishchev M-55 airplane for high-altitude Arctic  studies during the winter and spring months of 1996 to 1998. The M-55 Geophysika is roughly equivalent in purpose and performance to America's U-2 reconnaissance plane, which has been renamed the ER-2 and flies research missions for NASA.</p>
        <p>However, it can carry much heavier loads than the American plane, enabling it to fly large analytical instruments to altitudes up to 67,000 feet.</p>
        <p>Depletion of the earth's stratospheric ozone, which protects human beings and animals from dangerous solar ultraviolet radiation, was detected in 1975 by a high-flying U-2. Since then, depletion of the ozone layer has progressed to the  point at which a gigantic hole in the ozone layer opens over Antarctica every southern spring. Less severe but marked depletion of the ozone layer has also begun to occur over the Arctic during the northern spring, and there has been pronounced thinning of the ozone shield even over temperate regions in recent years.</p>
        <p>Most atmospheric scientists attribute the ozone depletion to increasing quantities of chlorofluorocarbons and similar Freon compounds released into the  atmosphere by human activity. Freons have been used for many years as refrigerant gases in refrigerators and air-conditioners, as foaming agents in plastic, as insulators, as solvents for cleaning computer components and in many other applications. Although the United States banned Freon propellants in  aerosol sprays in 1978, some nations continue to manufacture Freon-propelled sprays.</p>
        <p>Although production of these chemicals is now prohibited in most industrial nations, their effects on the ozone layer are expected to increase and linger for many years. At high altitudes, Freons are broken down by ultraviolet radiation from the sun, producing chlorine compounds that react with ozone. This initiates a chain reaction, in which the destructive chlorine compounds are regenerated, becoming available to destroy still more ozone.</p>
        <p>According to the European Science Foundation, which is based in Strasbourg, France, the M-55 provided by the Myasishchev Design Bureau, the Russian Central  Aereological Center and Aviecocenter will be able to study the chemical reactions believed to occur on the surfaces of fine ice particles that make up polar stratospheric clouds. These clouds, which appear in early spring, seem to  play a pivotal role in catalyzing the chemical reactions that lead to the destruction of ozone.</p>
        <p>The leader of the scientific team, Dr. Leopoldo Stafanutti of the Italian National Research Council, hopes to combine measurements made by the M-55 with mathematical models of possible physical and chemical changes occurring in the stratospheric clouds. This, he hopes, will lead to methods by which forecasts can be made regarding changes in the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>Participants in the Airborne Polar Experiment include some 20 research institutions in Russia, Italy, Germany, Britain, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. The group plans particularly to study lee wave clouds, clouds of ice particles that form downwind of mountain peaks, in Scandinavia and the Urals. The plane will also analyze the chemistry and physics of polar stratospheric clouds in the Siberian Arctic, where no comparable measurements have ever been made, the foundation said.</p>
        <p>A secondary object of the flights, each of which may last up to six hours, will be to catalogue all types of aerosol particles present in the European and  Arctic atmosphere up to the plane's operational ceiling. Aerosols come from both natural sources (like volcanoes) and human activity (such as the burning of soft coal).</p>
        <p>The M-55 has been scrutinized by Western observers only a few times since NATO intelligence experts spotted it at a Soviet airfield in 1982. Six of the planes were built, five of which remain in military service. The civilian version, the Geophysika, is a single-seat airplane with two jet engines, twin tail booms and wings 133 feet long, and it has a huge instrument bay that can carry more than 3,000 pounds.</p>
