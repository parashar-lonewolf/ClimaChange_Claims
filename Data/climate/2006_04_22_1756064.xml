        <p>His shaggy green mullet gives away his age, but the animated superhero Captain Planet is, improbably, mustering enough midlife energy to fight a few more villains seeking to destroy the world.</p>
        <p>To commemorate Earth Day today, Boomerang, the digital cable and satellite channel, is showing two commercial-free marathons of 13 ''lost'' episodes of ''Captain Planet and the Planeteers,'' Ted Turner's sometimes ridiculed pet television project for teaching environmental issues to children. First shown in 1990 on Mr. Turner's TBS network and in syndication, the series, which tried to make children environmental crusaders -- its slogan is ''The Power Is Yours!'' -- ran for five seasons in the United States.</p>
        <p>A sixth season was produced for international distribution, but Boomerang executives said the episodes were never broadcast on American television, and have not been included in recent reruns shown on Cartoon Network and its spinoff, Boomerang. (Both networks are divisions of TBS.) Boomerang will show the full season this morning from 7:30 to noon (Eastern and Pacific Times; 6:30 to 11 a.m., Central) and again from 3:30 to 8 p.m. (2:30 to 7 p.m., Central).</p>
        <p>''It's not often that we receive premieres of shows that finished in production years ago,'' said Marc Buhaj, Boomerang's vice president for programming and scheduling.</p>
        <p>The show's supporters, including Mr. Turner's daughter Laura Turner Seydel, are hoping that the renewed visibility will add momentum to their movement to revive the series with new episodes.</p>
        <p>In the 16 years since the show first appeared, ''none of the issues have gone away,'' said Ms. Seydel, chairwoman of the Captain Planet Foundation, which awards grants for environmental education projects, ''and if anything,'' she added, the ecological crisis has grown worse.</p>
        <p>''We know more about the science of global warming, the massive extinction of species, the lack of clean water, desertification, all those issues,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Barbara Y. E. Pyle, the series's co-executive producer, recalled: ''When we conceived of the stories, we tried to take them out to the edge of fantasy. We would make up these fantastic stories, and darn if they didn't come true.''</p>
        <p>Except for an episode in which villains try to renew the cold war, the plotlines of the sixth season are surprisingly topical, considering that they are 10 years old. The five international Planeteers, who invoke powers of wind, fire, water, heart and earth, combat evildoers like Dr. Blight and Looten Plunder, who are clear-cutting old-growth forests, running puppy mills, destroying the Mississippi Delta, even running for president. The messages are hardly subtle. In the ''Twelve Angry Animals'' episode, the Planeteers are tried for humanity's crimes against their fellow species. ''Fry 'em, fry 'em,'' cries a raven when the humans are found guilty.</p>
        <p>As one of the last vestiges of Mr. Turner's slate of cause-related programming, the ''Captain Planet'' episodes are as much artifacts as entertainment. Not content just to devote his wealth to foundations, Mr. Turner in the 1980's and 90's also loaded his networks, including CNN, with programs and shows promoting his favorite concerns.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Turner sold TBS to Time Warner in 1996, most of his issue-related television initiatives gradually disappeared, although he has remained on the Time Warner board. (He recently announced that he would not seek re-election to the board next month.)</p>
        <p>The Goodwill Games, a quadrennial televised sports competition that Mr. Turner created in 1985 in the wake of the Soviet and American Olympics boycotts, ran out of steam in 2001. ''Earth Matters,'' CNN's weekly environmental news show, also ended that year.</p>
        <p>And if members of the CNN staff utter the word ''foreign'' on the air -- a term Mr. Turner banned because he thought it conveyed an ''us versus them'' mentality -- they are no longer slapped with fines. Laurie Goldberg, a CNN spokeswoman, said that while ''international'' was still preferred by the network, the prohibition on ''foreign'' was not enforced.</p>
        <p>''Captain Planet and the Planeteers,'' whose characters' voices were supplied by celebrities like Whoopi Goldberg, Ed Asner, Martin Sheen, Meg Ryan, Sting, LeVar Burton and Helen Hunt, could also have disappeared, except for the passion of a few true believers, including Ms. Seydel. When the show went off the air, she stepped in to take over the Captain Planet Foundation, which had previously been supported by licensing and merchandising revenue from the series.</p>
        <p>The foundation, based in Atlanta, disbursed $180,000 last year in small grants to support environmental projects in schools, said K P Hendry, its senior director of special events. The foundation has helped keep ''Captain Planet'' alive, as has the show's continuing popularity internationally. (There are Hindi, Spanish, Mandarin and Thai translations of ''Captain Planet,'' which appears in regular rotations on Cartoon Network and Boomerang worldwide, Mr. Buhaj said.) When Time Warner wanted to take down the ''Captain Planet'' Web site, turner.com/planet, Ms. Hendry said the foundation ''begged'' for it to be maintained. The foundation also tracked down the sixth-season episodes.</p>
        <p>''It was as surprising to us as anyone that we had a new season of 'Captain Planet,' '' Mr. Buhaj said.</p>
        <p>The foundation is currently soliciting signatures on a petition seeking the creation of new episodes and is negotiating with an educational group to use some ''Captain Planet'' material as a teaching aid, Ms. Hendry said.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile Mr. Turner stays involved behind the scenes. His Ted's Montana Grill chain of buffalo meat restaurants is to open its first New York City location in Midtown in the fall. Ms. Seydel said proceeds from the opening would support the Captain Planet Foundation.</p>
