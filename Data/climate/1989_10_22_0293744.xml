        <p>THE YEAR 2000 FAST APPROACHES, and millennial doom is in the air. Global warming, nuclear proliferation, chaos in Eastern Europe. Even the notion of post is over. Post-modernism, post-history, post-culture (to borrow the critic George Steiner's term) - we're beyond that now. ''The sun is about to set on the post-industrial era,'' declares the economist Lester C. Thurow in The New York Times.</p>
        <p>What follows post? Samuel P. Huntington, Eaton Professor of the Science of Government at Harvard, has a name for the latest eschatological craze: ''endism.'' The critic Arthur C. Danto theorizes on ''the end of art.'' Bill McKibben, a former staff writer for The New Yorker, issues a dire report on ''The End of Nature.'' Clearly, it's late in the day.</p>
        <p>On the face of it, the lead article in the summer issue of The National Interest, a neoconservative journal published in Washington, seemed like more bad news. ''The End of History?'' it asked. The author, Francis Fukuyama, a State Department official, was unknown to the public, but his article was accompanied by ''responses'' from Irving Kristol, Allan Bloom, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and others notable for their gloomy prognostications.</p>
        <p>The magazine's readers were in for a surprise. What was Fukuyama saying? That the end of history is good news. What is happening in the world, claimed his eloquent essay, is nothing less than ''the triumph of the West.'' How else to explain the free elections in Poland and Hungary? The reform movement in China? The East German exodus?</p>
        <p>In Fukuyama's interpretation, borrowed (and heavily adapted) from the German philosopher G.W.F. Hegel, history is a protracted struggle to realize the idea of freedom latent in human consciousness. In the 20th century, the forces of totalitarianism have been decisively conquered by the United States and its allies, which represent the final embodiment of this idea - ''that is, the end point of mankind's ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy.'' In other words, we win.</p>
        <p>Within weeks, ''The End of History?'' had become the hottest topic around, this year's answer to Paul Kennedy's phenomenal best seller, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers.'' George F. Will was among the first to weigh in, with a Newsweek column in August; two weeks later, Fukuyama's photograph appeared in Time. The French quarterly Commentaire announced that it was devoting a special issue to ''The End of History?'' The BBC sent a television crew. Translations of the piece were scheduled to appear in Dutch, Japanese, Italian and Icelandic. Ten Downing Street requested a copy. In Washington, a newsdealer on Connecticut Avenue reported, the summer issue of The National Interest was ''outselling everything, even the pornography.''</p>
        <p>''Controversial'' didn't begin to cover the case. Unlike that other recent philosophical cause celebre, Allan Bloom's ''The Closing of the American Mind,'' Fukuyama's essay was the work of a representative from what is often referred to in academic circles as the real world. This was no professor, according to the contributor's note that ran in the magazine, but the ''deputy director of the State Department's policy planning staff.''</p>
        <p>It wasn't just the message, then; it was the source. Maybe there was an agenda here. . . . By mid-September, Peter Tarnoff, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, could speculate on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times that ''The End of History?'' was ''laying the foundation for a Bush doctrine.'' Not bad for a 16-page article in a foreign-policy journal with a circulation of 6,000.</p>
        <p>YOU HAVE TO PASS THROUGH A METAL detector to get to Francis Fukuyama's office in the State Department, and the silver plaques beside the doors - INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS MATTERS, NUCLEAR RISK REDUCTION CENTER - confirm that this isn't a philosophy department. But the elegant private dining room on the 8th floor, overlooking the Potomac, could easily be mistaken for an Ivy League faculty club. Plush carpets, chandeliers, a sideboard out of Sturbridge Village, oil portraits of 19th-century dignitaries on the walls - an environment conducive to shoptalk about Hegel.</p>
        <p>It's mid-September, and the arrival of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze for meetings with Fukuyama's boss, James A. Baker 3d, is less than a week away. ''It's a busy time,'' says Fukuyama, apologetically. Apart from assisting in the preparation of ''talking points'' for the Secretary of State, he's been besieged with telephone calls from book editors and agents eager to cash in on his famous article.</p>
        <p>How does he account for the commotion? ''I don't understand it myself,'' Fukuyama says quietly, sipping a Coke. ''I didn't write the article with any relevance to policy. It was just something I'd been thinking about.''</p>
        <p>He does seem an unlikely celebrity. (But so was Paul Kennedy. So was Allan Bloom.) His khaki suit has an off-the-rack look about it, and he speaks in a tentative, measured voice, more intent on making himself clear than on making an impression. A youthful 36, he emanates a professorial air - an assistant professorial air.</p>
        <p>Fukuyama doesn't quite fit the neo-conservative stereotype. Whatever ideological direction he has gone in lately, he's still a child of the 60's. He belongs to the Sierra Club; he's nostalgic for California, where he worked for the Rand Corporation; he worries about pesticides in the backyard of the small red-brick bungalow in the Virginia suburbs where he lives with his wife and infant daughter.</p>
        <p>''The last thing I want to be interpreted as saying is that our society is a utopia, or that there are no more problems,'' he stresses. ''I simply don't see any competitors to modern democracy.'' In short, he's a liberal neo-conservative.</p>
        <p>Fukuyama grew up in Manhattan's Stuyvesant Town, a middle-class housing development on the Lower East Side. His father was a Congregational minister who later became a professor of religion, and Fukuyama's own direction in the beginning was toward an academic career. As a freshman at Cornell in 1970, he was a resident of Telluride House, a sort of commune for philosophy students; Allan Bloom was the resident Socrates. They shared meals and talked philosophy until all hours, living the good life Bloom would later evoke in ''The Closing of the American Mind,'' the professor and his disciples sitting around the cafeteria discussing the Great Books.</p>
        <p>Fukuyama majored in classics, then did graduate work in comparative literature at Yale, where he studied with the deconstructionist Paul de Man (who would achieve posthumous notoriety when it was discovered that he'd published pro-Nazi articles in the Belgian press at the height of World War II). ''It was kind of an intellectual side journey,'' Fukuyama says.</p>
        <p>After Yale, he spent six months in Paris, sitting in on classes with Roland Barthes and Jacques Derrida, whose abstruse and fashionable discours would become required reading for a generation of American graduate students. Fukuyama was less than impressed. ''I was turned off by their nihilistic idea of what literature was all about,'' he recalls. ''It had nothing to do with the world. I developed such an aversion to that whole over-intellectual approach that I turned to nuclear weapons instead.'' He enrolled in Harvard's government department, where he studied Middle Eastern and Soviet politics. Three years later he got a Ph.D. in political science, writing his thesis on Soviet foreign policy in the Middle East.</p>
        <p>Fukuyama's first job out of the academic world was at the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica. Then, in 1981, Paul D. Wolfowitz, director of policy planning in the Reagan Administration (and also a former student of Bloom's), invited him to join his staff. Fukuyama worked in Washington for two years, then returned to Rand.</p>
        <p>For the next six years, he wrote papers for Rand on Soviet foreign policy, speculating on such weighty matters as ''Pakistan Since the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan'' and ''Soviet Civil-Military Relations and the Power Projection Mission.'' In ''Gorbachev and the Third World'' (published in the spring 1986 issue of Foreign Affairs), Fukuyama claimed that Soviet foreign policy was still expansionist, and that despite efforts to economize at home and act conciliatory abroad, Gorbachev was quietly ''trying to stake out a more combative position'' in client nations like Angola and Afghanistan, Libya and Nicaragua. The message of these heavily footnoted articles was clear: The cold war is still on.</p>
        <p>Last February, shortly before he returned to Washington to become deputy to Dennis Ross, the new director of policy planning, Fukuyama gave a lecture at the University of Chicago in which he surveyed the international political scene. It was sponsored by his former professor, Allan Bloom. ''My whole life has been spent in organizations that prize technical expertise,'' says Fukuyama. ''I was anxious to deal with larger and more important issues'' - what Bloom calls ''the big questions.''</p>
        <p>As it happened, Owen Harries, co-editor of The National Interest, was looking around for a think piece on the current situation - a piece, as Harries explains it, that would ''link history with the great traditions of political thought.'' Harries got hold of Fukuyama's lecture and instantly recognized that it was ''a provocative, stimulating essay, just what the times needed.''</p>
        <p>HARRIES, A DONNISH, PIPE-SMOKING Welshman whose desk is piled high with books - he was educated at Oxford and was for many years a professor of politics - belongs to a type that exists only in Washington. Leon Wieseltier, literary editor of The New Republic, calls them ''policy intellectuals.'' In New York, people talk about the latest issue of Vanity Fair; in Washington, they talk about the latest issue of Foreign Policy.</p>
        <p>Some of these policy intellectuals are in government; Carnes Lord, the author of a highly regarded translation of Aristotle's ''Politics,'' is national security adviser to Vice President Quayle. Others are ''fellows'' or ''scholars'' at the Heritage Foundation or the Brookings Institution. Often, they have grand titles; Michael Novak, for instance, is the George Frederick Jewett Scholar in Religion and Public Policy at the American Enterprise Institute. Many are fugitives from academic life. ''A lot of people around the office came up to me after the article appeared,'' Fukuyama says. ''Hegelians who hadn't gotten tenure.''</p>
        <p>The political orientation is well to the right. ''We hold to a traditional view of foreign policy,'' says Owen Harries. And what does he mean by ''traditional''? ''The belief that power politics is still in business. A belief in the efficacy of force.''</p>
        <p>The National Interest is clearly a well-heeled outfit. It's funded by the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, a prominent neo-conservative organization; the John M. Olin Foundation, established by a wealthy manufacturer who made his fortune largely in munitions, and the Smith Richardson Foundation -which, says Harries, ''supports a number of good causes around the place.''</p>
        <p>The magazine's quarters, in a modern office building on 16th Street in Washington, are a far cry from the grubby cubicles one associates with political journals on the left (if there still are any). The floors are carpeted and the phones ring with a muted chirp. The elevator has piped-in Mozart instead of Muzak. Directly across the street, behind a high wrought-iron fence, is the Russian Embassy.</p>
        <p>The National Interest, now four years old, is the creation of Irving Kristol - listed on the masthead as its publisher. His desk at the magazine is sort of in the lobby area; but then, he occupies many desks. Apart from his two magazines (he's also publisher of The Public Interest), Kristol is a distinguished fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. Last year, he gave up his professorship at New York University and moved to Washington. New York was no longer the nation's intellectual center, he wrote in The New Republic a few months later, explaining his decision. The intellectuals had disappeared into the universities. The culture of Washington was just as ''nasty and brutish,'' in Kristol's Hobbesian view, as anywhere else. ''But there is one area in which Washington is an intellectual center, and that is public policy: economic policy, social policy, foreign policy, today even educational policy.''</p>
        <p>Living in Washington doesn't make Kristol any less a New Yorker. The cigarette, the rumpled seersucker jacket, the shrewdly self-deprecating wit are more congenial to a seminar room at the City University of New York's graduate center on 42d Street than to a Washington think tank. Why did ''The End of History?'' make news? ''I'd like to think it's because my coming to Washington from New York has raised the level of discussion,'' Kristol says with a laugh. And Fukuyama's thesis? ''I don't believe a word of it.''</p>
        <p>Neither did a lot of other prominent opinion-makers around town. ''At last, self-congratulation raised to the status of philosophy!'' sneered Christopher Hitchens, a Washington-based Englishman who writes a column for The Nation. ''The Bush years have found their Burke, or their Pangloss.'' For Strobe Talbott, editor at large for Time magazine, ''The End of History?'' was ''The Beginning of Nonsense.''</p>
        <p>If it wasn't nonsense, Fukuyama's basic thesis wasn't exactly news, either. For months, conservatives had been gloating over the demise of Communism. ''The perennial question that has preoccupied every political philosopher since Plato -what is the best form of governance? - has been answered,'' wrote Charles Krauthammer in The Washington Post last March, before anyone had ever heard of Francis Fukuyama. ''After a few millennia of trying every form of political system, we close this millennium with the sure knowledge that in liberal, pluralist, capitalist democracy we have found what we have been looking for.'' Essentially, that was Fukuyama's message, but it didn't draw swarms of reporters to Krauthammer's door.</p>
        <p>So how did ''The End of History?'' become such a big event? It was the Hegel spin that did it. Not only is America winning, Fukuyama claimed, but the flourishing of democracy around the world is the fulfillment of a grand historical scheme. The end of the cold war and the disarray of the Soviet Union reflected a larger process -the realization of the Idea. History, Hegel believed (or Fukuyama says he believed), ''culminated in an absolute moment - a moment in which a final, rational form of society and state became victorious.'' And that moment, it just so happens, is now.</p>
        <p>A weird thesis, utterly speculative and impossible to prove. But ''The End of History?'' was a stylish performance, erudite and written with a rhetorical flair rare in the somber prose of Washington policy journals; it possessed intellectual authority.</p>
        <p>Fukuyama's respondents greeted the piece with open arms. ''I am delighted to welcome G.W.F. Hegel to Washington,'' declared Kristol. Senator Moynihan, himself a Harvard government professor before he discovered politics, confessed that his grasp of Hegel was shaky; but he dusted off his European history, tossing in a few references to Marx and Rousseau. ''It is not often that one has the opportunity to argue about Hegel in The National Interest (or anywhere else, for that matter),'' noted the historian Gertrude Himmelfarb, who is the wife of Irving Kristol. Soon after the article appeared, there was a conference held to discuss it at something called the United States Institute of Peace. Kristol, Himmelfarb and Krauthammer were in attendance, along with the Sovietologist Richard Pipes. The rest is . . . history?</p>
        <p>IT'S NOT HARD TO SEE why Fukuyama's essay won favor among this community. It's not only the high-flown references to Kant and Hegel, not only the message that Western democracy beat out the competition. ''The End of History?'' has a polemical edge familiar to readers of ''The Closing of the American Mind.''</p>
        <p>Like Bloom, Fukuyama doesn't have much patience for non-Western cultures. (''For our purposes,'' he writes, ''it matters very little what strange thoughts occur to people in Albania or Burkina Faso.'') And like Bloom, Fukuyama's no booster. The West isn't so hot either. At the heart of his critique is a veiled contempt for the very culture whose triumphs in the political sphere it purports to celebrate.</p>
        <p>What distinguishes Fukuyama from the crowd of conservative pundits elated by Gorbachev's troubles is his curled-lip attitude toward the victorious party. Say the West has won, that fascism and Communism are dead, that no significant ideological challenges are on the horizon - then what? There's an ''emptiness at the core of liberalism,'' Fukuyama maintains. What does America have to offer? ''Liberal democracy in the political sphere combined with easy access to VCRs and stereos in the economic.'' The society Hegel envisioned at the end of history, a universal state in which the arts flourish and virtue reigns, is nowhere to be found. Instead we're stuck with a ''consumerist culture'' purveying rock music and boutiques around the world.</p>
        <p>So the end of history may not be such a good thing after all. In fact, Fukuyama concludes, it will be ''a very sad time.'' Why? Because the meaning of life lies in the causes that we fight for, and in the future there won't be any. ''The struggle for recognition, the willingness to risk one's life for a purely abstract goal, the worldwide ideological struggle that called forth daring, courage, imagination and idealism, will be replaced by economic calculation, the endless solving of technical problems, environmental concerns and the satisfaction of sophisticated consumer demands.'' Put plainly, we're heading for a time of ''boredom.''</p>
        <p>As a Washington cab driver said when I tried to explain why I was in town, ''Give me a break!'' Does Fukuyama really believe all this? ''I guess I prefer not to answer that,'' he said one afternoon, talking in his State Department office. ''Leave it ambiguous. All I can say is, if people can't take a joke. . . .''</p>
        <p>That he meant to be provocative is obvious; but it's clear from his rational, erudite prose that he wasn't fooling around. As a political theorist, Fukuyama is more in the tradition of Bentham or Locke than of pop futurists like Alvin Toffler. ''All I meant by that last paragraph,'' he says, ''was that there's a tension in liberalism that won't go away. There are all kinds of reasons for being a liberal: the security and the material wealth it provides, the opportunity for spiritual and intellectual development. But it fails to address some fundamental questions. You know, what are the higher ends of man? Should we just be content with having secured the conditions for a good life, or should we be thinking about what the content of that good life is?''</p>
        <p>IF LIBERALISM STILL has a few kinks to work out, Communism is finished, although ''there may be some isolated true believers left in places like Managua, Pyongyang or Cambridge, Massachusetts,'' writes Fukuyama with characteristic acerbity.</p>
        <p>In Cambridge, the contempt is mutual. Even in that citadel of 1960's subversion, there aren't too many Communists left, but there is an inordinately dense concentration of people around Harvard Square who know their Hegel, and the summer issue of The National Interest sold out there virtually overnight. By and large, the Cambridge intelligentsia is dubious about ''The End of History?'' The distinguished Harvard government professor Judith N. Shklar didn't even have to read Fukuyama's piece in order to dismiss it as ''publicity.'' Her colleague Daniel Bell, who did, pronounced it ''Hegel at third remove . . . and wrong.'' (Bell's classic book, ''The End of Ideology,'' anticipated Fukuyama 30 years ago.) The historian Simon Schama, author of ''Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution,'' is more tolerant. Himself an idiosyncratic practitioner of the genre, he found the piece ''spirited and lively,'' but wonders how Fukuyama could have failed to address the revival of religious fundamentalism or the conflicts that could arise out of nationalism. ''It's more of a theological document, don't you think, a work of prophecy,'' he says. ''I mean, nobody really believes in the end of history.''</p>
        <p>It's not too hard to think of scenarios that would spoil Fukuyama's end of history. Who's to say what would happen in the Soviet Union if glasnost and perestroika collapse? What new dangers might a reunified Germany pose? Or a newly industrialized China? And what about the nuclear threat? That would put an end to things, the political scientist Pierre Hassner observed, ''in a more radical sense than he envisages.''</p>
        <p>Gertrude Himmelfarb's response in The National Interest was perhaps the most damaging refutation of all. To begin with, Hegel never said that history would end in a literal sense; it's a continuous process in which ''the synthesis of the preceding stage is the thesis of the present, thus setting in motion an endless dialectical cycle - and thus preserving the drama of history.'' And what about black poverty, the poverty of the underclass? asked Himmelfarb. In southeast Washington, where young blacks are dying nightly in the front lines of the drug war, history doesn't seem over; it seems to be just beginning. As Irving Kristol tartly put it, ''We may have won the cold war, which is nice - it's more than nice, it's wonderful. But this means that now the enemy is us, not them.''</p>
        <p>Liberals complained that Fukuyama ignored the third world. Conservatives weren't too enthusiastic about his dour assessment of the winning team. Where is it written that government should provide for the spiritual needs of its citizens? Michael Novak wondered in Commentary. Democracy promises freedom from tyranny; it doesn't promise to make us happy. ''The construction of a social order that achieves these is not designed to fill the soul, or to teach a philosophy, or to give instruction in how to live,'' Novak wrote. Democracy isn't a required course; it's an elective.</p>
        <p>ANUMBER OF COMMENTATORS have compared ''The End of History?'' to the famous article published by George F. Kennan in Foreign Affairs in July 1947 and signed with an anonymous ''X.'' Kennan's essay warned of Moscow's expansionist tendencies and called for a policy of ''firm and vigilant containment,'' thus supplying the term that would come to characterize America's foreign policy in the postwar era.</p>
        <p>In an article in Policy Review last summer, ''Waiting for Mr. X,'' Burton Yale Pines, the magazine's associate publisher, called for an update. The cold war was over, Pines agreed; only what was the United States doing about it? How to deal with the turmoil Gorbachev's reforms have provoked? What should be our policy toward Eastern Europe? ''Needed, in essence, is another 'X' article,'' wrote Pines - an article that would encourage the United States to seize the initiative. Given this hunger for a sequel, it's not surprising that Fukuyama is being touted as our ''X.''</p>
        <p>But is he? It's tempting to dismiss the whole thing as a media phenomenon. ''Each year needs a new sensation,'' says Daniel Bell. ''It encapsulates a mood that people feel and gives it a vocabulary.''</p>
        <p>The practical consequences have been more difficult to measure. In the wake of Shevardnadze's visit, interpreters of foreign policy were busy scrutinizing speeches for evidence of endism. Did Fukuyama's article reflect President Bush's thinking? Was it a high-level policy paper in disguise? Senator Moynihan, for one, is skeptical. ''The minute you announce that the cold war has ended and history is over,'' he notes, ''a lot of people are going to say, 'Hey, wait a minute, we're out of a job.' '' If only for bureaucratic purposes, then, history is still a going concern. As for the article's actual influence, ''there's no connection between this piece and what the Government does,'' Kristol says flatly. ''No one in the Administration has read it.''</p>
        <p>Everyone else has. Whether or not we've reached the end of history, we haven't reached the end of ''The End of History?'' The fall issue of The National Interest featured more ''responses,'' and you still can't pick up a magazine or a newspaper without stumbling across some reference to Fukuyama. ''I don't see much of a future for liberal democracy here in Peru's Shining Path country, but people would be pretty excited about VCRs if they only had electricity,'' the journalist Tina Rosenberg reported with laconic irony in The New Republic, writing from Baja Collana, Peru. ''But that's just one of those technological problems Francis Fukuyama says we'll have to spend our time grappling with now that there are no more ideological conflicts to keep us busy.''</p>
        <p>In a way, though, the question mark in Fukuyama's title has pre-empted criticism. History, after all, is only a way of making sense of things. Human beings depend on narrative to create an illusion of order, the literary critic Frank Kermode has argued in his profound book, ''The Sense of an Ending.'' ''To make sense of their span they need fictive concords with origins and ends, such as give meaning to lives and to poems.''</p>
        <p>''The End of History?'' is a poem. (No wonder no one in the Administration has read it.) Even if we have come to the end of history, that may not be the end of it. As the historian Jerry Z. Muller observed, writing in Commentary last December, ''After late capitalism comes more capitalism.'' And after the end of history comes more history.  THOUGHTS FROM 'THE END'</p>
        <p>The passing of Marxism-Leninism, first from China and then from the Soviet Union, will mean its death as a living ideology of world historical significance. For while there may be some isolated true believers left in places like Managua, Pyongyang, or Cambridge, Massachusetts, the fact that there is not a single large state in which it is a going concern undermines completely its pretensions to being in the vanguard of human history. And the death of this ideology means the growing ''Common Marketization'' of international relations, and the diminution of the likelihood of large-scale conflict between states.</p>
        <p>This does not by any means imply the end of international conflict per se. For the world at that point would be divided between a part that was historical and a part that was post-historical. Conflict between states still in history, and between those states and those at the end of history, would still be possible. There would still be a high and perhaps rising level of ethnic and nationalist violence, since those are impulses incompletely played out, even in parts of the post-historical world. Palestinians and Kurds, Sikhs and Tamils, Irish Catholics and Walloons, Armenians and Azeris, will continue to have their unresolved grievances. This implies that terrorism and wars of national liberation will continue to be an important item on the international agenda. But large-scale conflict must involve large states still caught in the grip of history, and they are what appear to be passing from the scene.</p>
        <p>The end of history will be a very sad time. The struggle for recognition, the willingness to risk one's life for a purely abstract goal, the worldwide ideological struggle that called forth daring, courage, imagination and idealism, will be replaced by economic calculation, the endless solving of technical problems, environmental concerns and the satisfaction of sophisticated consumer demands. In the post-historical period there will be neither art nor philosophy, just the perpetual caretaking of the museum of human history. I can feel in myself, and see in others around me, a powerful nostalgia for the time when history existed. Such nostalgia, in fact, will continue to fuel competition and conflict even in the post-historical world for some time to come. Even though I recognize its inevitability, I have the most ambivalent feelings for the civilization that has been created in Europe since 1945, with its North Atlantic and Asian offshoots. Perhaps this very prospect of centuries of boredom at the end of history will serve to get history started once again.  (From ''The End of History?'' By Francis Fukuyama, The National Interest, No. 16, Summer 1989.)</p>
