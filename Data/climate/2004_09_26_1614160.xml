        <p>GREEN DAY -- Before pop-punk devolves completely into bratty teen comedy, Green Day reclaims punk's ambition with ''American Idiot'' (Reprise). It's nothing less than a rock opera about a ''Jesus of Suburbia'' adrift in an America that's brainwashed by mass media, debased by materialism and facing Armageddon. The music connects buzzsaw punk to British rock from Merseybeat to glam -- including two nine-minute, five-part suites -- and Green Day trumps any pretension with melody and sheer fervor.</p>
        <p>RAY CHARLES -- The collaborators sound nervous on the last album Ray Charles recorded, ''Genius Loves Company'' (Concord), and they should. It's a collection of duets with stars like Norah Jones, Elton John, Willie Nelson, Bonnie Raitt, B. B. King and Gladys Knight, all striving to live up to the example he set. There are moments when his age and weakness show, but no one could use the cracks in a voice the way Charles did to sound wise or humble, heartsick or wry. He never places a note exactly where it's expected or takes a lyric for granted, and his guests reach for blues and soul they may not have known they had.</p>

        <p>GREEN DAY -- Before pop-punk devolves completely into bratty teen comedy, Green Day reclaims punk's ambition with ''American Idiot'' (Reprise). It's nothing less than a rock opera about a ''Jesus of Suburbia'' adrift in an America that's brainwashed by mass media, debased by materialism and facing Armageddon. The music connects buzzsaw punk to British rock from Merseybeat to glam -- including two nine-minute, five-part suites -- and Green Day trumps any pretension with melody and sheer fervor.</p>
        <p>RAY CHARLES -- The collaborators sound nervous on the last album Ray Charles recorded, ''Genius Loves Company'' (Concord), and they should. It's a collection of duets with stars like Norah Jones, Elton John, Willie Nelson, Bonnie Raitt, B. B. King and Gladys Knight, all striving to live up to the example he set. There are moments when his age and weakness show, but no one could use the cracks in a voice the way Charles did to sound wise or humble, heartsick or wry. He never places a note exactly where it's expected or takes a lyric for granted, and his guests reach for blues and soul they may not have known they had.</p>
        <p>SARAH McLACHLAN -- Sarah McLachlan's song ''World on Fire'' bemoans war, poverty and holes in the ozone layer, declaring them ''more than I can handle.'' The new video makes a modestly brilliant gesture: it stacks up budget items for a typical clip against what the same $150,000 would buy as relief efforts -- cattle, bicycles, housing, education, medicine -- and concludes ''So that is where all the money went.'' Ms. McLachlan's donations are detailed at www.worldonfire.ca. No, cheaper rock-star videos wouldn't end poverty, but the contrast between show-business splurges and practical aid is startling.</p>
        <p>THE FAINT -- Smirking all the way, the Faint prove that 1980's dance-funk revival extends well beyond New York and London on ''Wet From Birth'' (Saddle Creek), a 10-song, 34-minute album. Singing about anything from male lust to the clinical details of gestation and birth to paranoia and terrorism, the Faint is never less than snappy. The band puts its own mark on those 1980's punk and electro grooves; the way that a piano note ricochets behind the beat in ''How Could I Forget'' is just one ingenious touch among hundreds.</p>
        <p>TALIB KWELI -- Talib Kweli wants to get everything into his raps: swagger and sense, politics and fun, romance and respect for women, ghetto credibility and anti-gangsta admonitions, mainstream gloss and underground integrity. He comes closer than ever on his new album, ''The Beautiful Struggle'' (Geffen). It includes productions by hitmakers like the Neptunes, Jus Blaze and Kanye West along with his regular collaborators, and taking a trick from Puff Daddy, he samples the Police for one song. Between the hooks, he's as earnest as ever, but now he's dressed to party.</p>
        <p>EARLIMART -- The ghost of Elliott Smith suffuses Earlimart's new album, ''Treble and Tremble'' (Palm). The band's leader, Aaron Espinoza, was Smith's neighbor, and he sings, ''I miss you my friend.'' Mr. Espinoza virtually channels Smith's breathy, banked-down vocal style, his love of minor chords, his echoes of the Beatles and his haze of sullen despair. It's simultaneously a homage and a haunting, but Smith's memory is good for Earlimart, replacing arty moping with gravity.</p>
        <p>QUEEN LATIFAH -- For Act IV of her career -- after being a rapper, actress and talk-show host -- Queen Latifah (Dana Owens) gets older than old-school. On ''The Dana Owens Album'' (A&amp;M), she sings standards and 1960's songs with big band or orchestra. While she doesn't exactly revolutionize the style, she knows what she's doing, phrasing with warmth and a touch of jovial flirtation. At least there's one rapper who can sing.</p>
        <p>BUDDY MILLER -- Devastation and divine mercy are the concerns of Buddy Miller's album ''Universal United House of Prayer'' (New West), which finds a new, idiosyncratic take on country gospel. Mr. Miller plays guitar in Emmylou Harris's band; his wife, Julie Miller, collaborated on some of the new songs. The music can be cozy and old-timey or it can let its electric guitar twang and ring, and the songs are ornery and awestruck all at once.</p>
        <p>POLLY PAULUSMA -- Polly Paulusma has a deceptively wispy voice, akin to Beth Orton or Sandy Denny, and her folky songs are filled with unabashed kindness. On her album, ''Scissors in My Pocket'' (One Little Indian), her songwriting uses a subtly effective bit of technique; she often starts a melody calmly and then rushes through more syllables at the end, as if she has grown breathless with all she has to tell.</p>
        <p>BLUES EXPLOSION/THE MOONEY SUZUKI -- New York rock primitivism gets two different kinds of upgrade on the Blues Explosion's ''Damage'' (Sanctuary) and the Mooney Suzuki's ''Alive and Amplified'' (Red Ink/Columbia). The Blues Explosion (with leader Jon Spencer no longer top-billed) hooks up with the rock and funk drummer Steve Jordan and with hip-hop characters like DJ Shadow, Dan the Automator and Chuck D; the result is no less raucous than before, but with tauter songs and jack-in-the-box textural jolts. The Mooney Suzuki court pop with production by the Matrix, Avril Lavigne's producers. The Matrix doesn't try to modernize the band's heavy-breathing garage-rock; instead, it heads for the sound of the 1960's Top 40, deepening the anachronistic joke.</p>
