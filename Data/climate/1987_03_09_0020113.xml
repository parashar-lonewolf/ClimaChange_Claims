        <p>LEAD: Almost abandoned by the public treasury that was supposed to care for them, 20 monuments in New York City have been put up for private adoption so they can survive an increasingly hostile environment.</p>
        <p>Almost abandoned by the public treasury that was supposed to care for them, 20 monuments in New York City have been put up for private adoption so they can survive an increasingly hostile environment.</p>
        <p>Their designers are in the forefront of art and architecture: Augustus Saint-Gaudens, Stanford White, Daniel Chester French, John Quincy Adams Ward and Richard Morris Hunt. Their subjects are in the forefront of history: Columbus, Joan of Arc, Washington, Lafayette, Lincoln and Maj. Gen. William Jenkins Worth, who was buried beneath his monument.</p>
        <p>Today, this public legacy bears deep scars. Acid rain, automobile fumes and factory emissions have eaten away at bronze and turned marble sponge-like. Vandals have torn off heads and arms, pausing only to cover granite pedestals with spray paint. Repairs Exceed City Budget</p>
        <p>And the city government spends about $175,000 a year on seven or eight workers who care for 800 statues and 700 other public monuments. In contrast, some $1.3 million is needed to repair and restore the 20 monuments in question. Repairs for the monuments up for adoption are expected to cost from $3,500 to $275,000 each.</p>
        <p>''These works of art are barometers of our impotence over controlling the world in which we live,'' said Kent L. Barwick, president of the Municipal Art Society, which organized and will coordinate the ''Adopt-a-Monument'' program with the Parks and Recreation Department and the City Art Commission.</p>
        <p>Before the fiscal crisis of the last decade, the city's monuments crew had as many as 14 full-time workers, according to Joseph P. Bresnan, a former parks agency official who has helped select the monuments for adoption. After the fiscal crisis, he said, the crew was reduced to one.</p>
        <p>While the crew has grown since then, it is half the size it was in the 1960's -''totally unrealistic,'' the Curator of Parks, Donald M. Reynolds, said. Mr. Reynolds said he would need 21 more workers to maintain the monuments properly. Sponsors for Monuments' Care</p>
        <p>In recent years, civic groups and corporations have adopted single monuments on an ad hoc basis. But this is the first attempt to meet the need citywide. It also amounts to an acknowledgment that government cannot adequately care for this artistic patrimony.</p>
        <p>As far as its organizers know, ''Adopt-a-Monument'' is the only program in the country that seeks to restore such a wide range of monuments with private money.</p>
        <p>Not all of the works chosen are masterpieces. ''We wanted a representation in all five boroughs and a wide range of prices,'' said Paul Gunther, director of development at the Municipal Art Society. Two $275,000 Projects</p>
        <p>Nine are in Manhattan, four in Brooklyn and three in Queens, and there are two each in the Bronx and on Staten Island. At the high end, work on the Columbus Monument at Columbus Circle and the Heinrich Heine Fountain in the Bronx would cost $275,000 each. On the other end, work on ''Alamo'' on Astor Place would cost $3,500.</p>
        <p>The Municipal Art Society, which was founded in the 19th century to beautify New York, is to deposit the donation in an account with the New York Community Trust and serve as intermediary, working with government agencies to secure needed approvals and as restoration manager, contracting the needed work.</p>
        <p>An informal group called the Bronze Committee, composed of city officials and private curators and conservators, will be consulted about appropriate restoration techniques. ''We are not going to force conservation methods on anyone,'' said Phyllis Samitz Cohen, an organizer of the program. Recognition of Donors</p>
        <p>When it comes to recognition of donors, they will be entitled to all the printed publicity they can get but nothing of the engraved variety - with the possible exception of monuments that are on large sites where a plaque would be less conspicuous.</p>
        <p>Two monuments, both in Central Park, have already found patrons. ''King Jagiello'' has been adopted by the American Conservation Association for $30,000. ''Still Hunt'' has been adopted by William S. Beinecke for $3,500.</p>
        <p>Some statues that were not so lucky will be on display beginning Thursday in the Villard Houses, 457 Madison Avenue at 51st Street, in a show that is being assembled by Ms. Cohen.</p>
        <p>There is a ''Discus Thrower'' that was removed from Randalls Island after vandals wrenched off the discus, sawed off the left arm and were halfway through cutting off the right arm. There is a bust of John Howard Payne (composer of ''Home, Sweet Home''), which vandals were rolling down a hill in Prospect Park when the police stopped them. A Sword Returned</p>
        <p>On Friday, Ms. Cohen got a welcome surprise. Allan Cox, supervisor of monuments for the Parks Department, arrived with the sword that Gen. Henry Warner Slocum once brandished over Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn. The Slocum monument is up for adoption and the sword had been presumed lost.</p>
        <p>Underlying both the adoption program and the show is the theme of civic indifference. Mr. Barwick said he did not think that the city's budget priorities were ''inappropriate, given the problems of the homeless and education.''</p>
        <p>But Joan K. Davidson, president of the J. M. Kaplan Fund, which supports the arts in New York, said: ''Monuments and other outdoor works of art are integral elements of public spaces and therefore as deserving of governmental assistance as are the trees in our parks. In the meantime, the private sector is trying to carry out a holding operation.''</p>
        <p>''I think it's wonderful that any monuments are being cared for,'' said Lewis I. Sharp, curator of American paintings and sculpture at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ''But it's a shame that the city has never developed a program for maintenance that is more responsible than it has been.''</p>
        <p>Speaking about the adoption program, Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern said: ''It's not like Little Orphan Annie looking for Daddy Warbucks.</p>
        <p>''The city can provide a certain level of care. It can't polish every monument every morning. Obviously, if we get private funds, the monuments can get a higher level of care. It's an effort we appreciate.''</p>
        <p>Commissioner Stern said he was seeking to increase the budget for monuments by $1.3 million. However, when asked if there was a political ally who would champion such a cause in budget negotiations, Mr. Stern said, ''If there is, his name so far escapes me.''</p>
