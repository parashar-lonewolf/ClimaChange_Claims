        <p>IN the swelling ranks of the superwealthy, where the number of American families worth more than $10 million has jumped fourfold, to 275,000, over the last decade, demand for servants has risen to levels not seen since the Roaring Twenties, before household appliances brought factory-floor efficiency to the home.</p>
        <p>The ''essentials'' for a well-staffed home now include a maid, a launderer, a chef, a chauffeur and nannies for each child. The most prized servant occupies a new category altogether, the household manager, who pays bills, returns gifts, oversees home repairs, researches appliance purchases, coordinates moves among various houses and manages other staff. In Manhattan, the minimum annual cost to staff a home this way is $500,000, according to Keith Greenhouse, president of the Pavillion Agency, which places domestic help.</p>
        <p>And yet, to exploit the advances of the future, the rich are going to need still more categories of what they just can't seem to get enough of: good help.</p>
        <p>Even ''smart'' appliances in the most up-to-date Park Avenue penthouse will need to be told a few things. A computerized refrigerator capable of ordering groceries may not know, for instance, that the family it provisions is in Tuscany instead of consuming its daily ration of skim milk and bran on the terrace. Tomorrow's Jeeves will not only have to know a family's tastes and whereabouts but also have the technical skill to slap down an appliance that's not with the program. A complete retinue might line up like this:</p>
        <p>Techster</p>
        <p>In a wired household, which could mean multiple homes in different countries all talking to one another over an intranet, life is all but unlivable without someone paid to wield a mighty mouse over it all.</p>
        <p>For this servant, recruited from the likes of M.I.T. with a hefty options package, ''downstairs'' would bear a passing resemblance to an air-traffic control center. He or she would integrate a good English butler's intuition and discretion with the household's networked appliances, entertainment systems and security devices. The techster will not be expected to pitch in if a nanny gets sick, except to access www.marypoppins.com for a substitute.</p>
        <p>Medster</p>
        <p>With the resources to be very, very old and very healthy, the rich will need an in-house health care coordinator who can preside over the customization of medications, assist with reproduction and have an inside track on what clinical trials might merit judicious string-pulling. This domestic would also keep daily tabs on the bodily functions and medical data of the family, adjusting dosages, menus and workout programs with input from the nutritionist, chef, trainer and esthetician.</p>
        <p>Monetician</p>
        <p>It takes time and considerable concentration to dispose of serious money, either through consumption or by giving it away to worthy (and tax-deductible) causes. To spend just $1 million a year, for example, requires finding about $20,000 worth of services and stuff to buy every week. The monetician, a certified public accountant who ideally would have experience on Wall Street, in the nonprofit world and as a personal shopper, would coordinate with analysts, appraisers, decorators, stylists and charitable causes. The need will most likely be especially acute among the newly rich who are occasionally subject to sticker shock.</p>
        <p>Ecotist</p>
        <p>Multiple homes with great lawns, gardens, forests,  oceanfronts and seagoing vessels demand ecosystems management. The ecotist would help the rich re-landscape their estates to match global-warming trends that might raise sea levels and shrink acreage.</p>
        <p>In coordinating the work of the family's landscape architects, gardeners and chauffeurs, the ecotist would use his expertise in environmental law to monitor the effect of the chemicals used in lawn, garden and boat care. He would check to make sure that household waste was disposed of in ways that do not invite federal prosecution. He would also coordinate exterior security systems with the techster, seeking a balance between the family's need for privacy and the public-relations cost of inflicting serious bodily harm on lost hikers.</p>
        <p>There is a silver lining in all this for the nonrich, especially if they have a knack for technology and a yearning to hang out in a very big house. Domestic service, at least at the high end, will most likely become more challenging, more lucrative and more secure. The mistress of the house, it seems likely, would be hesitant to fire a techster if she knows that he could program the refrigerator to seek revenge.</p>
