        <p>LEAD: A Reagan Administration report asserting that the nation faces little immediate danger from acid rain has provoked an an unusually sharp challenge from scientists.</p>
        <p>A Reagan Administration report asserting that the nation faces little immediate danger from acid rain has provoked an an unusually sharp challenge from scientists.</p>
        <p>Any Federal document that may affect legislation or policy is certain to stimulate criticism from groups who feel their interest are threatened. But the report issued last week by the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program provoked more than the expected attacks by disappointed environmentalists.</p>
        <p>Many scientists, some of whom have contributed to the Federal research effort, complained that the report's executive summary was inaccurate and misleading, and appeared to be aimed more at buttressing the Reagan Administration's opposition to expensive pollution controls than at clarifying scientific knowledge. Several scientists suggested that the summary had been tailored in this way in the belief that policy-makers and journalists would read it and not the report itself.</p>
        <p>The report also appears to have reopened wounds in relations between the United States and Canada, which wants the United States to control sources of acid rain it says that contribute to the destruction of its lakes and forests.</p>
        <p>After seeing the new report, Tom McMillan, Canada's environment minister, complained in an interview that it was ''voodoo science,'' intended to prove that ''the situation is not as bad as it is said to be and therefore there is no need to act with urgency.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, several scientists told the New York Times that they could not comment publicly on the report because they feared they would lose their Federal grants if they criticized it.</p>
        <p>''There are political pressures on everyone not to say anything - people's careers are in jeopardy,'' said one scientist using Governnment money for an acid rain project.</p>
        <p>But J. Laurence Kulp, director of the assessment program, said that the report had been prepared ''with total professional honesty.''</p>
        <p>''It is a state-of-the-science document, the very best we could come up with,'' Dr. Kulp added. ''In no case was there a political overtone. Much of the criticism is misleading or erroneous. Whichever way we came out the other side would have been unhappy.'' Criticism Is 'Welcome'</p>
        <p>Asked about scientists who complained they were under pressure not to criticize the report, Dr. Kulp said, ''there is no pressure from me. I have and continue to welcome any scientific criticism.''</p>
        <p>The interagency report, which was authorized by Congress, found that damage to lakes from acid rain is limited at present to a few areas in the Northeast and is unlikely to grow significantly worse in the next few decades. It found that there is probably no damage to trees from acid precipitation except possibly as a minor part of ''multiple stresses'' at high altitudes. It also found no demonstated effects on human health at current average levels of pollution, and no quantified effects on buildings, other materials or crops.</p>
        <p>Congress is considering legislation to curb the pollution that cause acid rain, largely sulfur dioxides and nitrogen oxides that are carried through the atmosphere where they are transformed chemically and fall to earth as acidic rain, snow, fog, or dry particles. The legislation would focus largely on pollution from large power plants, the major source of sulfur dioxide pollution.</p>
        <p>Critics of the summary report complained that while it made no policy recommendations, its findings led to the conclusion that there is no urgent need to deal with acid rain. They said those findings did not accurately reflect the bulk of science on acid rain that has emerged in recent years, much of which could be found in the body of the mult-volume report itself.</p>
        <p>''It conveys no sense of urgency but instead provides a rationale for going on researching without any sense that controls may be needed,'' said Eville Gorham, professor of ecology at the University of Minnesota. Disputed Definition of Acidity</p>
        <p>Dr. Gorham was especially critical of what he said was the ''downplaying'' of the destruction of freshwater life by acid rain. This was done, he said, by choosing an inaccurate definition of what constituted an acidified lake.</p>
        <p>The report counted as acidified those lakes that had a pH of 5 or below. The pH factor is a measure of hydrogen ion concentration and the lower the pH the greater the acidification. Pure water has a pH of 7, coffee has a pH of 5 and lemon juice of 2. At a pH of 5, only about 10 percent of lakes in a few scattered areas, notably New York's Adirondack Mountains, were found to be acidified, the report found. More over, the acid content of the lakes appeared to be at a steady state - that is, they were not becoming more acid at the present time in those areas.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gorham said that a pH of 5.5 was a better definition of acidification, because at that level many aquatic organisms were being affected. At that level 20 percent of lakes in sensitive areas would be acidified, he said.</p>
        <p>Other scientists, including Michael Oppenheimer of the Environmental Defense Fund, said that a wide body of research that shows that freshwater organisms show serious reaction when the pH level is 6, or 10 times less acidic than the benchmark chosen in the report. Substances that are neither acidic nor alkaline have a pH of 7.</p>
        <p>Critics also noted that the report focussed only on the United States, ignoring the much larger areas in Canada that are vulnerable to acid rain.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kulp said that pH 5 was chosen because below that level sport fish start to show dramatic effects, While other organisms may be affected at lower levels of acidification, such damage did not lower the economic value of a a body of fresh water, he said. He added that the damage to Canada's lakes was not included in the report because there were no data equivalent to those for United States waters. Contradictory Studies Cited</p>
        <p>The contention that even lakes in sensitive areas are holding their own was challenged by James N. Galloway, associate professor of environmental science at the University of Virginia, who said that there are many studies that demonstrate the contrary view. Dr. Galloway also said that the executive summary of the report ''ignores data'' that show lakes in other area of the country, especially the South, to have a pH of less than 5.</p>
        <p>Dr. Galloway also said that the assessment program seemed to have ignored the most recent data.</p>
        <p>Gene E. Likens, a biologist and director of the New York Botanical Garden's Institute of Ecosystem studies said: ''I was disappointed because the executive summary really misreprented the scientific understanding about the effects of acid deposition on the environment.'' He cited what he said was the report's failure to consider the evidence that acid rain has an effect on tree foliage. ''We don't know the overall effect but to say there is no effect is just not true,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Jack G. Calvert, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the chairman of a National Academy of Sciences panel on acid rain, said that there were some important new findings in the report, including the conclusion that pollutants from natural sources, such as the hydrogen peroxide some trees produce, were an important part of the problem. But he questioned the report's conclusion that there was no quantified information about the damage caused to buildings and materials by acid rain. He also said that the report's description of future trends in pollutants that cause acid rain make ''a specious argument'' that clean coal technologies will sharply reduce the pollutants.</p>
        <p>Orrie Loucks, director of the Holcombe Research Institute of Butler University in Indianapolis said that ''the report represents a very unusual selective elimination of research,'' and that it incorporates ''research of questionable value and high uncertainty.''</p>
        <p>He said that just recently the assessment program has ''embarked on a very good research design,'' for studying the effects of acid rain on forests. He called the report's conclusion about effects on forest ''premature.''</p>
