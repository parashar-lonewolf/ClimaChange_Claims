        <p>Three months after its external fuel tank took thousands of dings and pockmarks from the golf-ball-size hailstones of a freakish winter storm, the space shuttle Atlantis is ready to fly.</p>
        <p>NASA plans to launch the first shuttle mission of 2007 from the Kennedy Space Center at 7:38 p.m. Friday. The weather is expected to be very good, with just a 20 percent chance of a delay.</p>
        <p>The pockmarks have been repaired. But at a briefing last month, NASA cautioned reporters not to trust their eyes when they saw the mottled tank. Repaired spots have a creamy color, and the tank will have a speckled appearance until the spots darken over time to the tank's characteristic orange.</p>
        <p>''Your mind will have a hard time convincing your eyes'' that the finished product is smooth and robust enough to take the punishment of launching, said John Chapman, the external tank manager for the space shuttle program. He added, ''It's going to look pretty speckly.''</p>
        <p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has been looking a little battered lately as well. The agency has been reeling in recent months from missteps and sheer bad luck, including a fatal shooting by a disgruntled employee at the Johnson Space Center in Houston; the arrest and dismissal of a shuttle astronaut, Capt. Lisa M. Nowak, who faces charges of attempted kidnapping over a confrontation with a romantic rival; and a furor over comments by the agency's administrator, Michael D. Griffin, that he was not sure climate change ''is a problem we must wrestle with.''</p>
        <p>But now the shuttle is on the launching pad again, with three more flights on the schedule by the end of the year. The delays have forced the space agency to cram its already tight schedule of flights before the shuttle program ends in 2010; NASA had originally scheduled five flights for this year. The program's remaining flights are devoted to completing the international space station, except for a single flight to service the Hubble Space Telescope. NASA announced Thursday that the date of that mission has been tentatively set for Sept. 10, 2008.</p>
        <p>The crew is led by Col. Frederick W. Sturckow of the Marine Corps, a veteran of two previous flights who is serving on this flight as commander. The pilot is Col. Lee Joseph Archambaultof the Air Force. Other members of the crew are James F. Reilly II, Patrick G. Forrester, Steven R. Swanson, John D. Olivas and Clayton C. Anderson. Mr. Anderson was only recently added to the mission and will be traveling on Atlantis to swap places with Cmdr. Sunita L. Williams of the Navy, who has been working aboard the space station for six months and whose return has been held up by the numerous shuttle delays. The crew will strap into their seats about 4:15 p.m.</p>
        <p>On the 11-day mission, Atlantis will lug a 17.5-ton truss to the space station and astronauts will put it in place. The solar panels on the truss will be unfurled; a rotating joint that will allow the new arrays to track the sun will be readied and started; and an older set of panels that would block the motion of the new ones will be retracted.</p>
        <p>Most of the mission's tasks have been done before, and NASA hopes that in three scheduled spacewalks the astronauts will overcome previous crews' problems, like balky bolts and unwieldy solar panels that did not fold back up smoothly.</p>
        <p>During the launching, all eyes will be on that fuel tank. The smallest dents that required repair were sanded smooth. Deeper ones were repaired by carving out the holes and filling them with new foam, and the broad areas with the most hits were sanded down by a half inch or more with the foam reapplied. Lockheed Martin engineers created an ingenious new tool for milling the foam toward the pointy tip of the tank; they called it the ''pencil sharpener.''</p>
        <p>Nearly all the repairs are common to tank preparation, but there have never been so many on a single tank. NASA officials said the repairs had been thoroughly tested and were safe, though Mr. Chapman acknowledged in an interview on Thursday that ''you don't know until you fly.''</p>
        <p>Even if some of the foam rattles off the tank during ascent, NASA officials insist, the pieces will be too small to damage the craft -- much smaller than the 1.67-pound chunk of foam that broke a hole in the wing of the shuttle Columbia in 2003 and doomed that craft and its crew.</p>
        <p>John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said NASA now deals with safety issues far more thoroughly than it did before the Columbia disaster. Dr. Logsdon, who served on the independent board that investigated the loss of Columbia and its crew, said that now, ''The flight-readiness review process is as thorough as it's ever going to be with Mike Griffin in charge.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Logsdon added: ''They made an engineering judgment, and that's what we pay them to do. There's some level of risk in everything associated with this vehicle. All you can do is the very best job you can do, and then make a judgment.''</p>
