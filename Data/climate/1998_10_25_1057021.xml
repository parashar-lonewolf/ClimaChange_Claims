        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Deregulation is indeed causing power companies to slash or eliminate their conservation programs, but the problem is even worse than you report (''U.S. Splurging on Energy After Falling Off Its Diet,'' front page, Oct. 22).</p>
        <p>In 1997 spending by utilities dropped to $1.6 billion, and power companies invested in energy conservation only one-third the amount promised five years earlier. If utilities had invested at the levels they promised before deregulation, they would have prevented the emission of 11 million tons of global warming gases and 79,000 tons of soot and smog-forming pollutants.</p>

        <p>Deregulation is indeed causing power companies to slash or eliminate their conservation programs, but the problem is even worse than you report (''U.S. Splurging on Energy After Falling Off Its Diet,'' front page, Oct. 22).</p>

If utilities had invested at the levels they promised before deregulation, they would have prevented the emission of 11 million tons of global warming gases and 79,000 tons of soot and smog-forming pollutants.</p>
        <p>This would have saved more than $1 billion for customers in 1997 alone.</p>
        <p>The Federal and state governments must insure that future financing is available for energy efficiency programs. The best way to do this is through a public benefits fund that, like the one being set up in New York, provides money for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs.</p>

        <p>The writer is an analyst at the Environmental Working Group.</p>
