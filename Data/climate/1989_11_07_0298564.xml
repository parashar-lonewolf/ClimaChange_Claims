        <p>LEAD: The United States and Japan refused today to accept strong measures on curbing the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>The United States and Japan refused today to accept strong measures on curbing the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Attending a 70-nation conference on global warming, both countries, two of the world's most industrialized, said they would not endorse a commitment to control emission of carbon dioxide by the year 2000. Experts say such emissions are a major cause of the warming of the atmosphere, known as the ''greenhouse effect.''</p>
        <p>William K. Reilly, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency and leader of the American delegation here, said the Bush Administration recognized the carbon dioxide problem but believed that further study was necessary before binding controls could be proposed. Limiting excess carbon dioxide produced by the burning coal in power plants or gasoline in automobiles is the main target of the global-warming conference.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists and several governments in Scandinavia and Europe have called for controls to keep carbon dioxide emissions at current levels. They are also seeking ways to save energy and curb gasoline use to reduce the emissions. Oil and coal companies and large industrial users are the main opponents of such a strategy.</p>
        <p>A number of countries among the 70 represented by environmental officials in this western Netherlands seaport were preparing a tough declaration proposing specific curbs despite the opposition of the United States and Japan. A Netherlands plan for holding carbon dioxide emissions to the 1988 level by the year 2000 was the preferred approach. Such a declaration would not be binding on the nations that sign it.</p>
        <p>Brice Lalonde, the French environmental secretary, said Britain was the only one of the 12 nations in the European Community to oppose immediate targets for carbon dioxide curbs. Eastern bloc participants like the Soviet Union and Poland have also opposed specific targets, saying such controls would be too costly to their economies.</p>
        <p>The conference is one of a series that has examined the greenhouse effect and related problems.</p>
        <p>The United States has said the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, sponsored by the United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization, is the proper forum for introducing declarations on specific curbs. That panel's three working groups are led by the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union - all opponents of immediate action. The panel is not expected to produce a final report for another year.</p>
        <p>The United States is the principal source of carbon dioxide in the world, producing 23 percent of the total, according to United Nations figures from 1985. The Soviet Union produced 19 percent, followed by China, with 10 percent; Japan, 5 percent; West Germany, 4 percent; the Britain, 3 percent, and France, East Germany and Poland, 2 percent each. Worsened by Forest Loss</p>
        <p>The industrial pollution is made worse by the steady destruction of the world's forests because trees contribute to the recycling of carbon dioxide and the generation of oxygen.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists say every year's delay in curbing carbon dioxide adds greatly to the danger because the damage in the atmosphere is cumulative. Some scientists say carbon dioxide emissions might have to be cut by 70 percent or more in the next half century to restore nature's balance.</p>
        <p>The Netherlands announced plans today for unilateral action to cut emissions. The country has the most advanced environmental protection plan in the world, including stringent curbing of automobiles.</p>
        <p>The last Dutch Government fell in May over aspects of the plan, but the new Christian Democrat-Socialist coalition, scheduled to take office on Tuesday, has said it will put the plan into action.</p>
        <p>Eduardus Nijpels, the interim Environment Minister, said at the conference today that the Netherlands would cut carbon dioxide emissions in 1990 by 2 percent, and 2 percent more each year to a target of 8 percent in 1994. The Netherlands would be the first country to take such action.</p>
