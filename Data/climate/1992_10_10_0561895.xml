        <p>President Bush believes that the American economy is fundamentally sound and that the Government generally should keep its hands off and let the free market thrive.</p>
        <p>Gov. Bill Clinton, by contrast, holds that the economy has run aground and that the Government should step in, get it sailing again and plot its course in detail.</p>
        <p>Those contrasting views on the state of the economy and on what needs to be done about it in the next four years are at the heart of this year's election campaign.  Split From Parties</p>
        <p>Both men are outflanked within their parties. Mr. Bush does not go along with the Republican supply-siders like Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp who favor tax cuts at any cost. And Mr. Clinton has taken pains to distinguish himself from Democrats who support huge new Government programs financed by much higher taxes.</p>
        <p>But no one -- not even Ross Perot, who has his own distinct economic principles -- can fairly accuse the two main Presidential candidates in 1992 of being tweedledum and tweedledee on economic philosophy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush maintains that wealthy Americans are taxed too much. Mr. Clinton would raise their taxes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush says he would cut Government programs across the board. Apart from cutting the military budget, Mr. Clinton stresses additional Government spending.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush wants to loosen Government restrictions so businesses can become more prosperous. Mr. Clinton wants new regulations on business to force energy conservation and protect the environment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush favors free trade almost without exception. Mr. Clinton places more emphasis on making sure America's trading partners play fairly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's proposals on medical care and job training are based on tax incentives. Mr. Clinton would require employers to provide medical insurance and job training for their workers or pay extra taxes to the Government to do it for them.</p>
        <p>Neither man treats the Federal budget deficit as a primary problem. Despite the tax increase he agreed to as part of the 1990 budget deal, Mr. Bush has generally taken the position that keeping taxes low is more important to him than trimming the deficit. Mr. Clinton says the deficit must take a back seat to what he calls investment, a euphemism for spending Government money on education, training and public works projects that he says would pay off in the long run.</p>
        <p>This is in contrast to Mr. Perot, who has made lowering the deficit the cornerstone of his political campaign. "Unless we take action now, our nation may confront a situation similar to the Great Depression -- and maybe even worse," Mr. Perot asserts in the opening sentence of the book he put out last summer, "United We Stand: How We Can Take Back Our Country"</p>
        <p>But as much as he emphasizes the problem, Mr. Perot tends not to broadcast the painful solutions he promotes in the book to eliminate the deficit over the next five years: higher taxes on most Americans and sharp cuts in popular programs.</p>
        <p>On the campaign trail, Mr. Bush accuses Mr. Clinton of favoring European-style "social engineering" in which the Government would replace the marketplace as the driving force in the economy. Mr. Clinton says Mr. Bush would demolish programs like Social Security and Medicare that long ago took root in American society.</p>
        <p>Those assertions are nonsense. Mr. Bush would not abolish the welfare state, and Mr. Clinton would not impose a socialist economy. As different as their views are from one another's, neither takes such extreme positions. Candidates' Core Views</p>
        <p>Separating the candidates' campaign oratory from their core beliefs can be difficult, but looking at their records over the years, a fundamental distinction seems evident.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's basic tenet reflects the Wall Street-Greenwich-Andover-Yale milieu of his youth and the philosophy of the Texas oil country where he first went into business. It is that people with capital should be free to develop it with only a minimum of interference from the Government in the way of taxes and regulations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's core view, perhaps a consequence of his having become Governor of a poor state at the unusually young age of 32, is that Government programs, intelligently designed and properly executed, can make the country more prosperous and people's lives better.</p>
        <p>The two candidates offered the most thorough expositions of these philosophies in speeches to the Detroit Economic Club, Mr. Bush last month and Mr. Clinton in August.</p>
        <p>The President said it was his position that the main function of Government was "to keep tax rates low and make them even lower, to keep money sound, to limit Government spending and regulations and to open the way for greater competition."</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton advocated a middle course between the Republican principle of reliance on private enterprise and the Democratic orthodoxy that a Government program should exist to solve nearly every problem. "I don't believe in big Government," he said, "but I do believe in an effective Government that promotes jobs and growth and gives people more choice and better services and inspires more personal responsibility." Addressing the Topics</p>
        <p>The implications of their overall philosophies can be seen in the way Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton address these specific economic topics and social policies with economic implications:</p>
        <p>TAXES -- Mr. Clinton says tax policy should be used to redistribute wealth. Mr. Bush does not.</p>
        <p>Thus, Mr. Clinton proposes raising the top tax rate on family incomes above about $200,000, imposing a surtax on incomes above $1 million and increasing the minimum tax on wealthy taxpayers who have big deductions. He would use the revenue to finance a tax cut of a few hundred dollars a year to families with incomes below about $90,000.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Mr. Bush vetoed legislation this year that included many of his pet tax cuts for business because the measure included a modest tax increase on the wealthy.</p>
        <p>On capital gains taxes, the domestic issue on which he has seemed most exercised, Mr. Bush would reduce the rate on all investments. Economists disagree on the merits of such a proposal, but few doubt that the main direct beneficiaries would be the wealthiest taxpayers. Mr. Clinton would reduce the capital gains tax rate only for investors who start new businesses and hold them for at least five years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perot would raise the top tax rate to 33 percent from 31 percent on couples making more than about $90,000 and would lift the rate even higher, he says, if more money were needed to balance the budget. He also favors raising the gasoline tax by 10 cents a gallon each year for five years, increasing the taxes on Social Security payments received by beneficiaries with more than a modest income and allowing tax deductions for mortgage interest payments only on mortgage amounts below $250,000.</p>
        <p>TRADE -- Both main candidates favor expanding international trade. Mr. Bush believes so strongly that open markets lead to economic growth that he favors relaxing American trade barriers almost without exception. Mr. Clinton focuses more on retraining American workers who lose jobs because of free trade and to retaliating against countries that maintain trade restrictions against American products.</p>
        <p>ENERGY -- Mr. Bush worries aloud about increased use of imported oil, but he would rely on the markets to force change. He would open more areas to oil drilling, encourage greater use of nuclear power and give tax breaks to domestic producers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton favors increased Government intervention in the energy markets, including stricter automobile mileage standards, new restrictions on oil drilling offshore and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Government rules requiring a reduction in the emission of gases that could cause global warming and less reliance on nuclear power.</p>
        <p>HEALTH CARE -- Relying on private markets, Mr. Bush would offer tax credits to poor people to help them buy basic medical insurance. He would try to generate competition between insurance companies, would limit damages in malpractice suits and would encourage arrangements like health maintenance organizations to keep costs down.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton would have the Government impose an overall limit on national health spending, public and private, and would make the states set price restrictions on doctors and hospitals, if spending threatened to exceed the limit. He would require employers to provide medical insurance for their workers or pay a special tax to the Government to finance a public insurance program.</p>
        <p>JOB TRAINING -- Mr. Bush would give people losing their jobs vouchers of up to $3,000 to help them pay for training. Under Mr. Clinton, companies would have to spend 1.5 percent of their payroll on job training or pay the Government an equivalent amount to finance a public training program. Mr. Clinton would require large Government contractors to have special training programs as well.</p>
        <p>A basic rule of economics is that production and economic growth require three elements: physical capital like plants, machinery, equipment and buildings; human capital, which is the textbook term for workers, and technological change, which means product improvements, the introduction of new products and cost saving.</p>
        <p>Beyond the fundamental disagreement between Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton on the role the Government should play in the economy and the society, some economists have spotted another philosophical difference in the relative emphasis they place on these elements.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush stresses the importance of physical capital. He is vigilant in fighting inflation, one of the main deterrents to capital investment. And he argues that the cost of investment in plants, machinery and the like is too high, much higher than in Japan and Germany. That is why Mr. Bush pays so much attention to interest rates and to the costs the Government places on businesses through taxes and regulations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's innovative proposals are on the human side. Not only would he require businesses to pay for the training of rank-and-file workers, but he would have a national apprenticeship system to help students not bound for college obtain job skills. And he would replace the existing student loan program with a system in which college students could pay off their loans by paying a small portion of their incomes over time or by devoting two years to public service work -- as a school teacher in a poor neighborhood, say, or a police officer. HOW THE CANDIDATES DIFFER</p>
        <p>The specific policies Presidential candidates advocate in their campaigns often fall by the wayside, but the overall philosophies they espouse offer important insights into what kind of Presidents they would be. The economic philosphies of President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton are especially important, since both men have promised major steps to turn the economy around in the years ahead. Both men's tenets are closer to the center of the political spectrum than they are to the far right or the far left. But there are significant differences in what they stand for.  THEMES</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush holds that the American economy is basically healthy and that in most circumstances the Government should not interfere in the marketplace. He emphasizes the importance of tax breaks to generate investment in plants, machinery and equipment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton believes that the economy is seriously off track and that the Government should play an active role in reversing the course. He stresses new Government spending for public works projects, education and job training. SCORECARD</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's biggest problem in the election campaign is explaining why he stood by so passively in the face of the sour economy. Public opinion polls show that most people are prepared for more Government intervention in economic affairs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has not made clear how he would be able to pay for all the Government programs he wants without a substantial tax increase. In the past, public works projects have often been pork barrel. Government job-training programs have rarely been successful.</p>
