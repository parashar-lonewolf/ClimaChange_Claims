        <p>LEAD: IS the international economic system more stable than it looks? Even in the age of Aquarius, are government leaders more rational than they seem?

        <p>IS the international economic system more stable than it looks? Even in the age of Aquarius, are government leaders more rational than they seem? Is there, in short, a case for optimism about our ability to absorb shocks and threats to the system, and, without actually solving any of the major problems we face, at least to survive them?</p>
        <p>As the Canadian Government prepares to play host to next month's Toronto summit meeting of the leaders of the seven largest capitalist countries, it has laid out a case for optimism. In a brief for the conference, the Canadians find that the international economy has recovered from last October's worldwide financial shock better than expected. Most forecasters, the brief says, think the industrial countries can enjoy ''a sixth year of moderate growth with low inflation.''</p>
        <p>The Canadian eye detects signs that the huge imbalances of trade are starting to correct themselves. This week's report that the United States trade deficit had fallen to $35.9 billion in the first quarter from $41.2 billion in the final quarter of 1987 supports that hopeful reading.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the biggest boost to optimism will come this weekend from the Reagan-Gorbachev summit meeting in Moscow. The Senate is expected to approve the treaty banning certain classes of missiles and deliver it to Mr. Reagan before he takes off from Helsinki for Moscow.</p>
        <p>How to benefit from the improving East-West relations seems certain to become a top order of business at the Toronto meeting. At last year's Venice meeting, the talk about the likely effect of Mr. Gorbachev on the Soviet Union and what it means for the West produced the best discussion at the conference, according to people who were there. In the give and take, national leaders, each of whom had met Mr. Gorbachev, agreed that he was ''for real'' and that the changes he stood for were likely to be lasting. And now they are encouraged by the missile treaty and the start of Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>The economic benefits of the improvement in East-West relations could include not just an expansion of trade but lower outlays for nuclear missiles and a clearer path for restructuring the Atlantic alliance.</p>
        <p>The United States will be pressing for more equal ''burden sharing'' by its allies and for a reduction in ''defense protectionism'' - that is, European barriers to buying American weapons that can be made here at lower costs, with longer production runs.</p>
        <p>But even with progress on some fronts, Toronto will not lack for unsolved problems: the drug trade; terrorism; problems of the environment including hazardous substances, ozone layer depletion and acid rain, and health concerns such as cancer and AIDS. Other major topics contending for time on this year's agenda will be the ''population explosion,'' third world debt, starvation and economic decay in Africa, freedom of navigation in the Persian Gulf, and the seemingly humble but insoluble problem of ending barriers to trade in agriculture.</p>
        <p>Despite many setbacks, including some within their own country, the Canadians insist that, like Mehitabel the Cat, they are ''toujours gai'' about prospects for progress on trade. They are approaching the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations ''with a sense of urgency, determined to fight protectionist threats, to enhance the rule of law in international trade and to restore the momentum toward further trade liberalization.''</p>
        <p>All this hope comes in the midst of the confused battle over the United States trade bill, which its critics denounce as protectionist and its supporters hail as necessary for forcing open markets for American goods and giving the Government negotiating authority for the Uruguay Round. Before he took off for the Moscow summit meeting, President Reagan vetoed the trade bill, but it remains unclear whether the Administration really wants the bill or not. Nor is it clear whether the Democrats want the bill or would rather exploit a successful veto as a campaign issue.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the world appears to be holding together and even making headway. Prof. Martin Shubik, the Yale economist, mathematician and philosopher, puts at the top of his list of global problems terrorism, economic growth, pollution and the threat of nuclear war - all items for coming summit meetings - and says he is ''pleasantly surprised how good matters are, not how bad.'' Given the number of world powers involved and the state of the human scene, he finds it comforting that the globe has avoided nuclear war for four decades and more. He cites the poet Samuel Hoffenstein's confident prediction in 1947:  Fear not the atom in its fission  The cradle will outwit the hearse.  Man on this earth has a mission  To survive and keep on getting worse.</p>
