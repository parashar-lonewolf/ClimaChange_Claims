        <p>It is well known that the distribution and fate of living things on  Earth's surface are drastically affected by changes in climate; forests, for instance, migrate hundreds of miles in response to advancing and retreating ice-age glaciers, and the plants and animals dependent on forests must follow or die. But creatures of the deep sea have been thought to be insulated from the heat, cold and climatic turbulence of the surface.</p>
        <p>Now, by reading clues left by tiny ancient animals in sediment corings taken from the floor of the deep Atlantic, researchers have found that even life in the abyss is a slave to climatic change.</p>
        <p>The finding suggests that, contrary to the prevailing belief, the deep ocean is not an isolated ecological realm where life has flowered and diversified unaffected by the vicissitudes above. It also raises the question of whether the impact of global warming might extend to the utmost depths.</p>
        <p>The new evidence comes from corings obtained by drilling into the floor of the ocean on the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge below the sea, north and east of the Azores and two miles down. Trapped in the retrieved sediments were the calcified shells of many small marine creatures called ostracods. These crustaceans, about two-hundredths to four-hundredths of an inch long, lived on the ocean bottom millions of years ago; their modern relatives glow like fireflies. The ancient ostracods are the largest form of animal that left enough fossils so that patterns of their ancient abundance can be determined over time.</p>
        <p>The fossilized shells of still smaller ancient organisms, called foraminifera or forams, were also trapped in the sediments. These calcified shells contain varying traces of oxygen isotopes that indirectly tell scientists how much water was locked up as ice at any given time. By analyzing these, scientists can track the onset and retreat of ice ages.</p>
        <p>Dr. Thomas M. Cronin, of the United States Geological Survey, and Dr. Maureen E. Raymo, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, analyzed this evidence in a section of the corings representing a 450,000-year period between 2.4 million and 2.85 million years ago. They discovered that the number of ostracod species increased to as many as 12 in warm periods and dropped to as few as 2 or 3 in cold ones.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, these biological fluctuations were in harmony with a 41,000-year cycle of variations in the tilt of Earth's axis relative to the sun that are believed to regulate glacial cycles. The scientists' report appears in the current issue of the journal Nature.</p>
        <p>Dr. Cronin said he believed that the missing species of ostracods migrated to the shallower midocean during ice ages, where they found refuge until warmer conditions returned -- just as terrestrial creatures migrate to safe refuges during glacial cold. But the immediate reason for the ostracods' migration, he said, is unclear. It could be the cold itself or it could be that the cold reduced the creatures' food supply, forcing them to move.</p>
        <p>In any event, the finding ''makes it plain'' that deep-sea ecological communities are not exempt from the effects of climatic change on the surface and suggests that the deep sea ''is not an isolated, protected part of the environment,'' Dr. Michael A. Rex, a deep-sea ecologist at the University of Massachusetts in Boston, said in an interview. In a commentary in Nature, he wrote that ''the sheer scale of events invoked in this study is certainly unprecedented in deep-sea ecology''  and that the findings ''require a re-evaluation'' of the prevailing view that the deep sea owes its only recently appreciated biological richness to physical stability.</p>
        <p>Dr. Cronin said the research team had also detected but not yet published similar climate-linked changes in the diversity of deep-sea ostracod species on shorter and more recent time scales. That raises the question of what the impact on the ocean depths of a century or two of human-induced global warming might be. That, Dr. Raymo said, is the real importance of the new research. There has been ''a lot of speculation'' about the impact of warming on biological diversity, she said, ''but very little examination of how biodiversity has changed in the face of climate changes in the past.''</p>
        <p>There is wide agreement among scientists that Earth's climate has been warming for a century, probably because of the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, which releases heat-trapping carbon dioxide. They also predict that if emissions of the heat-trapping gases are not reduced, the average surface temperature of the globe will rise in the next 100 years by about half as much as it has risen in the past 10,000 years.</p>
        <p>If the prediction is right, Dr. Cronin said, the new findings suggest that the deep sea ''is not going to be immune'' from global warming.</p>
