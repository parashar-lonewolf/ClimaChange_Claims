        <p>A case can be made that Al Gore has been the most active and influential vice president in American history.</p>
        <p>There is little the Clinton administration has done or tried to do over the last eight years in which Mr. Gore has not played some role. From his early eagerness to cut budget deficits in 1993 to the aggressive fund-raising of the 1996 campaign to his role in the final days of the Kosovo conflict in 1999, Mr. Gore has been heard and, more often than not, heeded.</p>
        <p>He has suffered some painful defeats, such as when oil-state senators beat back his proposal to use energy taxes as a deficit-reduction tool, and notable victories, such as helping to put the threat of global warming on the national policy agenda.</p>
        <p>He played a critical part in the removal of thousands of nuclear weapons from former Soviet states; in pushing, though at first without much success, for a more muscular response to the bloodshed in Bosnia; in the government's proposal to regulate tobacco as a dangerous drug. He also had a hand in pressuring the entertainment industry to accept ''v-chip'' technology to shield children from sex and mayhem on television.</p>
        <p>There were stumbles, as well. Two of the worst came in the same month, March 1997, when Mr. Gore famously told a White House news conference that ''no controlling legal authority'' barred him from making telephone calls asking for Democratic political contributions from his office. Later that month, in Beijing, Mr. Gore clinked Champagne glasses with Li Peng, the Chinese prime minister who ordered the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989.</p>
        <p>''In the history of the vice presidency, Al Gore has a unique and remarkable record,'' said Stephen Hess, a scholar of the presidency at the Brookings Institution in Washington.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore was known within the administration as at least the second most influential adviser to the president, after Hillary Rodham Clinton. He was often the quickest to push an aggressive approach, whether on foreign policy or on budgets or on trade.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore was still vice president, not prime minister, and his advice was not always taken. Early in the administration, Mr. Gore sought a significant assignment, like carrying out the campaign promise to end welfare ''as we know it.'' But he wound up with the less-than-electrifying ''reinventing government'' initiative.</p>
        <p>Some of Mr. Gore's more assertive environmental ideas, like ratcheting up fuel economy standards for cars, were rejected by Mr. Clinton, who believed the issue was a political loser in the industrial Midwest.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's early pleas on the Balkans likewise went unheeded. In numerous internal discussions in early 1993, Mr. Gore pressed for the use of American air power to slow the ethnic slaughter in Bosnia, White House aides said. Mr. Gore was essentially silenced until 1995 when he again became a passionate advocate for allied intervention.</p>
        <p>Those who worked closely with the vice president cited his steadiness and his strength as an often welcome contrast to the pliancy of the president, who seemed to waver on his commitments to people and to policy, particularly early in his administration.</p>
        <p>But what mystifies these people is that while Mr. Gore was often bold and forceful in the councils of government, he has stumbled as a candidate and has failed to capitalize on his significant record of accomplishment to make the case for his election.</p>
        <p>''What's amazing about him is he's a much less courageous campaigner than I would have thought and much more courageous in governance than I thought he would be,'' said a senior White House official who has observed Mr. Gore closely for the last eight years. ''He was really gutsy as a government official, but that just doesn't translate to the campaign. Gore just wants to get elected, then he thinks he'll be free to do the right thing.''</p>
        <p>'Reinventing Government'</p>
        <p>Even before Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore were inaugurated in January 1993, the vice president had negotiated an unprecedented role for a No. 2.  He was not to be deputy president, but he would have real authority over a number of areas where he claimed expertise: the environment, science and technology and streamlining government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore exercised that power early on by placing loyalists in critical posts throughout the government. Leon Fuerth, his longtime foreign policy adviser, was included in every important meeting of the National Security Council. Carol M. Browner, a former Senate aide, was named administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Frank W. Hunger, Mr. Gore's brother-in-law, went to the Justice Department as head of the civil division. Kathleen McGinty, another former Senate aide, was put in charge of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. Reed Hundt, a friend from Mr. Gore's prep-school days at St. Albans, was named chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's first executive assignment was running the National Performance Review, more popularly known as the ''reinventing government'' initiative, or Rego.</p>
        <p>The task involved combing the entire federal bureaucracy for waste, duplication and uneconomic purchasing practices. It was a job for an accountant, not a would-be president, but Mr. Gore took to it like a man killing rats with a broomstick.</p>
        <p>He and his aides have attributed huge cost savings to the program -- the current estimate is $137 billion -- but those claims are essentially unprovable because it is impossible to know which reductions were a result of Rego and which came from productivity improvements enjoyed by the nation at large.</p>
        <p>In his third debate with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Mr. Gore claimed the reinvention program had reduced government civilian employment by 300,000 workers, to the lowest level since John F. Kennedy was president. In fact, the number of total jobs cut is considerably higher -- almost 400,000 -- but two-thirds of them are military workers whose jobs were eliminated by the military drawdown brought by the end of the cold war.</p>
        <p>''Gore is clearly wrong to argue that reinventing government caused the decline in civil service employment that did occur,'' said Paul C. Light, director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution. ''He would have been perfectly right to say the Clinton administration 'oversaw,' 'participated in,' or 'implemented' the cuts, but reinventing government did not cause the decline in total jobs. It was the end of the cold war, pure and simple.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore was the first vice president to serve as a full member of the National Security Council and was given broad sway over a large part of United States policy toward Russia. In April 1994, Mr. Clinton asked Mr. Gore to meet regularly with Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, then the Russian prime minister, to address aspects of United States-Russian relations that came under Mr. Gore's areas of expertise but did not rise to the presidential level. The two men took up disarmament, space cooperation, legal issues and the environment, among other issues.</p>
        <p>Bold Early Missteps</p>
        <p>The first year of the administration was memorable for its early chaos and the budget package that passed only with Mr. Gore casting the tie-breaking 51st vote in the Senate. The White House was riven into competing camps: those who wanted to attack the growing federal budget deficits and those who believed Mr. Clinton had to make good on his campaign promises to ''invest'' billions of new dollars in education, training and other social programs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton vacillated, torn between his liberal instincts and the arguments of advisers who said the only way he would ever be able to pay for new social programs was to first convince financial markets that he was serious about controlling federal spending.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore was firmly in the camp of the deficit hawks. And he saw an additional benefit to budget stringency: he could test his environmental theories in a real-life laboratory.</p>
        <p>The vice president pushed hard to have an energy tax included in the administration's first budget package, and Mr. Clinton finally acceded, over the objections of many political advisers who said that the painful plan was a sure loser on Capitol Hill. They were right. Congress rebelled at the proposal and the president quickly abandoned it, leaving Mr. Gore embarrassed and politically scarred.</p>
        <p>''Gore felt that if we were going to impose pain on the American people, he wanted it to be environmentally conscious,'' said a member of the administration's economic team. ''He believed that since we were raising so much from the top one or two percent, the plan's credibility depended on a little tough medicine that affected everybody.''</p>
        <p>In this battle, as in later fights, Mr. Gore argued that the public would reward boldness, that the administration would win points for taking on its own party in Congress and entrenched interests in private industry.</p>
        <p>He was wrong, as Mr. Clinton and the Democrats learned in November 1994, when Republicans took control of the House for the first time in 40 years. The economic plan, the health care proposal drafted by Mrs. Clinton, the effort to integrate gays into the armed forces were big, bold -- and politically devastating.</p>
        <p>Decisiveness Abroad</p>
        <p>By July 1995, the vice president saw the situation in Bosnia as becoming intolerable, with American dithering making it worse. The slaughter of Bosnian Muslims by Serbian forces troubled his conscience, recalled officials close to the vice president and violated his view of America's role in the world. He had watched as the United States had humiliatingly failed to enlist European support for a plan to arm the Bosnian Muslims and pound the Serbs from the air. He had expressed, repeatedly but in private, his frustration at the president's indecision.</p>
        <p>At a pivotal White House meeting in mid-July, Mr. Gore recalled a haunting newspaper photograph of a young woman from Srebrenica who had apparently hanged herself after Serbs overran the area. He said his daughter Karenna, then 21, had seen the picture and asked him why the United States was not doing more to end the conflict. He pleaded for more forceful action to punish the Serbs, according to officials who were present.</p>
        <p>''He just erupted in anger,'' recalled Richard C. Holbrooke, now ambassador to the United Nations. ''He said we didn't have a strategy anymore, we weren't facing the implications of what we were doing. He was sitting right next to the president at the time.''</p>
        <p>Within weeks, the United States led a series of punitive air strikes on Serbian targets and pressed a diplomatic offensive that ultimately resulted in the November peace accords signed at Dayton, Ohio.</p>
        <p>The agreement called for the deployment of 20,000 United States troops to the Balkans in the role of referees between the parties to the cease-fire. The policy was vigorously debated in Congress, and in the administration. Opponents in Congress were bolstered by misgivings privately expressed by senior military officers who did not want to see American soldiers dispatched to enforce what they felt was a shaky peace deal. Some of Mr. Clinton's political advisers warned of the dangers of a major military deployment just 11 months before a presidential election.</p>
        <p>In late November, Mr. Clinton assembled his senior civilian and military advisers in the White House situation room to discuss the Balkan military mission. The president spoke of the American commitment to enact the peace accord and the moral obligation to end the Bosnian disaster.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore then sternly addressed the Pentagon officials in the room, according to Mr. Holbrooke's recollection of the scene.</p>
        <p>His words were carefully couched, but the vice president's message was unmistakable: Get with the program or shut up.</p>
        <p>''On Somalia, Bosnia, Kosovo and the Middle East, he was always the most forceful advocate in the room for a strong policy,'' said Mr. Holbrooke, who is often mentioned as a likely candidate for secretary of state in a Gore administration. ''He wasn't always an interventionist; he's a very careful man. But he had a deep conviction on the importance of American leadership based on moral values and American national interests.''</p>
        <p>His Baby: The Environment</p>
        <p>The president and the vice president had a standing lunch date every week for the first years of the administration, broken only when one was out of town. Aides said that Mr. Gore used those sessions, among other things, as a tutorial for the president on environmental issues -- global warming, logging in the Pacific Northwest, oil drilling in Alaska, the Clean Air Act, land preservation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore devoted whole sessions with the president to obscure matters, like the evaporation of the Aral Sea in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The vice president contended that these issues were, like Bosnia and other foreign policy challenges, urgent matters not only of national interest but of moral obligation to future generations. It is a point that Mr. Gore made in his book, ''Earth in the Balance'' as well as in numerous public addresses.</p>
        <p>He also persuaded the president that the environment was a winning political issue, despite opposition in manufacturing states. It became part of the mantra of the 1996 campaign, during which the president and vice president warned in every speech of Republican assaults on ''Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's fervor won him friends among environmentalists even as he alienated Congressional Republicans and many in the business community. While he secured noteworthy successes -- particularly on air quality, the designation of more than three million acres as untouchable national monuments and a continued moratorium on oil drilling offshore and in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge -- his record was not without failures.</p>
        <p>Blocked by Congress, the administration failed to impose the higher mileage standards that Mr. Gore sought for automobiles. In another defeat, Mr. Clinton ignored Mr. Gore's advice and signed a spending bill that permitted the clear-cutting of certain Western forests. Three months after Mr. Clinton signed the bill, Mr. Gore told a group of environmentalists that the measure was the ''biggest mistake of the first term.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most significant environmental battle of the past eight years arose on Mr. Gore's signature issue, global warming. A 1997 worldwide conference in Kyoto, Japan, on reducing climate-altering gases was in danger of collapsing because of discord between industrialized countries and the developing world about how quickly and how sharply to reduce the output of greenhouse gasses.</p>
        <p>The Senate was already on record, 95-0, as opposing any agreement that held advanced nations to higher standards than developing ones. The United States delegation to the talks was making no progress, despite prodding from Mr. Gore by telephone. Mr. Gore's aides unanimously urged him to keep his distance from what was shaping up as a failure and a humiliating blow to his prestige. He overrode their advice and flew to Japan, where he told developing nations he understood their concerns and instructed American negotiators to reach a deal at all costs.</p>
        <p>''Kyoto was a shining moment for Al Gore,'' said Gregory Wetstone of the Natural Resources Defense Council. ''He disregarded the passionate requests of his staff that he steer clear of an international meeting that everyone thought was going to be a train wreck and jumped right in to work on what we all see as a huge problem.''</p>
        <p>Not everyone saw it that way. Congress has refused to even consider ratifying the Kyoto pact and the United States has taken no significant action since the 1997 conference to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
        <p>And global warming remains a contentious political issue. Governor Bush and his surrogates use Mr. Gore's position as a weapon against him in states dependent on automobile manufacturing and coal production; Mr. Gore issues warnings that Mr. Bush's industry-friendly policies could devastate the earth's fragile ecology.</p>
        <p>''The certainty, the absoluteness with which he states his position is frightening,'' said Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, a global-warming skeptic and sponsor of the Senate resolution that undercut Mr. Gore's position in Kyoto. ''He's so absolutely sure he knows what's best.''</p>
        <p>His Russian Connection</p>
        <p>More than any previous vice president, Mr. Gore was granted ministerial power by President Clinton. In April 1993, Mr. Clinton deputized him to oversee much of American policy on Russia and the former Soviet Union. The mechanism was a panel that became known as the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission.</p>
        <p>The relationship between Mr. Gore and Mr. Chernomyrdin remains a subject of much debate today. Republicans have harshly criticized the vice president about a confidential 1995 agreement between Mr. Gore and Mr. Chernomyrdin that allowed Russia to export a large cache of conventional weapons to Iran. The deal appeared to undercut a law, co-sponsored by Mr. Gore when he was a senator, that required economic sanctions against countries that transfer arms to countries that sponsor terrorism, including Iran.</p>
        <p>The early years of the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission yielded undeniable benefits, along with controversy. The two men sped the removal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan, discussed the privatization of much of Russian state industry, supervised the conversion of some Russian military enterprises to civilian work and took early steps toward establishment of free markets and the rule of law. Mr. Gore and Mr. Chernomyrdin furthered cooperation between the United States and Russia in space; their relationship helped avert a trade war in 1996 over frozen chicken parts.</p>
        <p>The process throughout was fraught with missteps, charges of corruption and Russian backsliding on commitments to reform. The Gore-Chernomyrdin channel was abruptly closed in March 1998, when Boris Yeltsin dismissed Mr. Chernomyrdin.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore's close ties to Mr. Chernomyrdin came into play again a year later when the United States was seeking an end to the latest Balkan conflict. Mr. Chernomyrdin was named Moscow's special envoy to Belgrade, with the task of trying to persuade Slobodan Milosevic to withdraw his troops from Kosovo. Mr. Gore and Mr. Chernomyrdin met late into the night at Mr. Gore's residence, helping to fashion a diplomatic strategy, ultimately successful, to force Mr. Milosevic to back down.</p>
        <p>Junior Partner to President?</p>
        <p>Throughout much of American history, the vice president has served chiefly as a reminder of presidential mortality. These eight years have proved another way of looking at the job. Mr. Clinton granted Mr. Gore broad power in areas of his expertise, and Mr. Gore applied it.</p>
        <p>His list of achievements was long, according to administration officials and outside experts.</p>
        <p>It was in large measure Mr. Gore's advocacy that moved Mr. Clinton to give the Food and Drug Administration authority to regulate tobacco as a drug and to restrict marketing of cigarettes to minors. (The agency's authority was struck down this year by the Supreme Court, which said such power resides only in Congress.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore demolished Ross Perot in a debate on the North American Free Trade Agreement and helped secure passage of the trade deal over the objections of many Democrats in Congress.</p>
        <p>The Federal Communications Commission, largely at the urging of the vice president, adopted a tax in 1996 on telecommunications companies to pay for wiring classrooms to the Internet.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's commitment to breast cancer research led to a doubling of federal spending on breast cancer research, prevention and treatment, to $599 million last year, according to the vice president's office.</p>
        <p>He pushed President Clinton to declare 40 million acres of public lands roadless areas and promoted the use of the Antiquities Act to set aside more acreage in the lower 48 states than any other administration.</p>
        <p>''It is hard to think of another administration where the president and vice president were almost peers,'' said Professor John J. Pitney, professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California. ''These are two people who genuinely working as partners, albeit a very senior and a junior partner.''</p>
        <p>But for all his influence, the vice president seems destined to be remembered as much for his political shortcomings as for his substantive achievements. He began the administration as the cigar-store Indian, standing inertly behind the president's right shoulder. That image was replaced by one of him at a Buddhist temple in California, symbolizing the fund-raising excesses of 1996. His most memorable utterance was his declaration, on the day the House of Representatives impeached the president for perjury and obstruction of justice, that Mr. Clinton would be remembered as ''one of our greatest presidents.''</p>
        <p>''When you are weighing presidential skills, there are several things you have to look at,'' Mr. Hess, the presidential scholar, said. ''Does he have a vision for the country? Does he have the psychological wellness, the temperament for the office? Does he have organizational skills? Can he communicate?''</p>
        <p>Does he? Can he?</p>
        <p>''Frankly,'' Mr. Hess said, ''after eight years, I'm not sure.''</p>
