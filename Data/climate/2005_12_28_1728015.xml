        <p>Seven Northeastern states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, have embarked on a regionwide plan to reduce power plant emissions of carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming. Two years in the making, the plan is the first collective effort in America to adopt mandatory controls for greenhouse gases. It is further evidence of the states' willingness to address an issue that Washington has largely ignored, as well as a timely antidote for the administration's dispiriting performance at the recent global warming conference in Montreal.</p>
        <p>The governors' message would have been stronger still had it not been for the defection of Gov. Mitt Romney, the Massachusetts Republican. He pulled the rug out from under his own negotiators with an 11th-hour complaint that the plan would impose unacceptable utility costs on consumers.</p>

        <p>Seven Northeastern states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, have embarked on a regionwide plan to reduce power plant emissions of carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming. Two years in the making, the plan is the first collective effort in America to adopt mandatory controls for greenhouse gases. It is further evidence of the states' willingness to address an issue that Washington has largely ignored, as well as a timely antidote for the administration's dispiriting performance at the recent global warming conference in Montreal.</p>
        <p>The governors' message would have been stronger still had it not been for the defection of Gov. Mitt Romney, the Massachusetts Republican. He pulled the rug out from under his own negotiators with an 11th-hour complaint that the plan would impose unacceptable utility costs on consumers.</p>
        <p>His case is unconvincing. The program's target -- a 10 percent reduction in current emissions levels by 2019 -- is modest indeed. Its design includes a market-based trading scheme aimed at reducing emissions cheaply, much as the successful federal acid rain program enacted in 1990 did. Last-minute changes, aimed largely at calming Mr. Romney's nerves, provided additional safety valves in case electricity prices rose to uncomfortable levels.</p>
        <p>Still Mr. Romney balked, leaving the impression that he was simply pandering to the White House and his party's right wing to further his presidential ambitions. The governor insists otherwise but, like it or not, he now finds himself the darling of Washington's ultraconservative think tanks, which have no use for greenhouse gas controls, and of James Inhofe, the reactionary chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, who regards global warming as a ''hoax.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Romney's gubernatorial compatriots -- including New York's governor, George Pataki, himself a potential presidential aspirant -- look bolder by comparison. The new multistate plan is no substitute for a national program of emissions controls, but the very fact that it exists should encourage those in Congress who seek one.</p>
