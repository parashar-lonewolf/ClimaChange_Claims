        <p>THE last time ice-age glaciers invaded the Northern Hemisphere, more than 10,000 years ago, they moved as far south as the Ohio River Valley in North America and to a line stretching from England to Ukraine in Europe, and what is now Manhattan was buried under a mile or so of ice. But that is nothing compared with what appears to have happened in the truly distant past, when all or most of the planet may have been frozen -- Snowball Earth.</p>
        <p>A new study suggests that glaciation froze the tropics not once in the remote past, but twice. Researchers found that 2.2 billion years ago, when only single-celled organisms lived, ice crept to within 11 degrees of the equator. That is roughly the latitude of the present-day tropical countries of Panama and Costa Rica. An earlier study showed glaciers pushing even closer to the equator between 600 million and 800 million years ago.</p>
        <p>The new study deepens the mystery of the ancient ice ages. If they really froze most of Earth, how was it able to recover and go on to support the evolution of complex forms of life? If such widespread ice ages did not occur, what would have caused the ancient ice in the tropics?</p>
        <p>In the latest study, American and South African researchers examined deposits of glacial rocks, and the volcanic rocks on top of and intertwined with them, in South Africa. Land masses were aligned differently then, and South Africa lay closer to the equator. By analyzing magnetic patterns in the rocks, the scientists determined their ancient latitude.  Other investigators had previously determined the age of the rocks by analyzing the rates at which their radioactive elements decay. The authors of the study, which is reported in the current issue of the journal Nature, were David A. Evans and Dr. Joseph. L. Kirschvink of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. N. J. Beukes of Rand Afrikaans University in Johannesburg.</p>
        <p>''The question is,'' Mr. Evans said, ''does this mean most of the Earth was frozen over at the time?''</p>
        <p>One possible alternative explanation, he said, is that Earth's axis was tilted, relative to the Sun, at a different angle from its tilt today. That could have shifted the zone of glaciation on the planet without freezing most of it. But some experts say that is unlikely because the Moon's gravitational influence would not allow a sharp change in axis tilt.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, some scientists question whether Earth could recover from a snowball state. Dr. Kirschvink said one recovery mechanism might involve the pumping of heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by extensive volcanic eruptions. The intertwining of lava with the glacial rocks in South Africa suggests just such an event, he said.</p>
        <p>Another possible explanation is that the heat generated by the impact of a comet or asteroid could have jarred Earth out of a refrigerated state. Still another is that the overturning of ocean water might have liberated carbon dioxide trapped in ocean sediments, said Dr. Alan J. Kaufman, a geochemist at Harvard University. Dr. Kaufman wrote a commentary in Nature on the new study.</p>
        <p>What would cause the water to turn over and spew carbon dioxide into the atmosphere? Midocean ridges are continually emitting the gas, Dr. Kirschvink said. At some point, he said, the buildup of gases might become unstable and, like champagne surging from a bottle, create an explosive upsurge of water that would fracture the ice above and release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The carbon dioxide could trap heat and begin the planet's warming.</p>
        <p>One way or another, Dr. Kaufman said, carbon dioxide probably holds the key to questions about the ancient glaciations. Rising and falling atmospheric concentrations of the gas have been closely correlated with Earth's long-term climate swings. That same gas is now being released into the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels like oil and coal, and mainstream climatologists say these emissions are likely to warm the planet, causing climatic disruptions and a rise in sea level over the next century.</p>
        <p>The enigma of Snowball Earth (a term coined by Dr. Kirschvink) is far from a solution, and one aspect of the search for an answer raises concern about how well scientists understand  climate, Dr. Kirschvink said. When computerized models of the climate system attempt to simulate what happened in ancient glaciations like those in question, he said, they produce an ''ice catastrophe'' in which Earth descends into an ice age and cannot get out.</p>
        <p>''You get locked into it and never escape,'' he said. ''If that had happened, we wouldn't be here.''</p>
        <p>This, he said, ''makes you sit back and worry a little bit about what the models are predicting.'' The models are the climatologists' primary tools for both understanding climate and forecasting how it will change, so they are the basis for predictions about future global warming. ''But if you don't know whether the Earth can survive an ice catastrophe,'' Dr. Kirschvink said, ''your models are not complete.''</p>
