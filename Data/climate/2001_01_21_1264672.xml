        <p>CAR companies establish divisions to cultivate specific images for certain products, and Ford's Think Division is no exception. In this case, though, the message is not luxury, utility or performance, but environmental friendliness.</p>
        <p>Unlike any other division of an American automaker, Think is wholly devoted to producing environmentally sustainable cars powered by batteries or hydrogen fuel cells.</p>
        <p>''Every new company needs a vision,'' said Nick Palmer, global brand manager for the Think Group. ''We want to be known for producing zero curbside emissions.''</p>
        <p>Ford's chairman, William C. Ford Jr., who is also an outspoken environmentalist, has a broader interpretation. ''Think was established from the start as a brand that stands for true sustainable transportation,'' he said in an e-mail message. ''Not just zero emissions, but a target of complete recyclability and the use of renewable energy.''</p>
        <p>Think, which began life as a Norwegian maker of plastic-bodied electric cars, has an identity and a mission. But whether that sense of purpose can be turned into a profitable enterprise is far from certain.</p>
        <p>The division has two distinct parts: Think Mobility is the brand name for a line of battery-powered vehicles; Think Technologies is Ford's principal research arm for the development of fuel cells, which hold promise as an eventual pollution-free replacement for the internal-combustion engine.</p>
        <p>Despite Ford's efforts to define Think in the market, the division has not yet made much impression on consumers. Although its small battery car, the City, has been sold in Scandinavia since 1999, Think's American sales are currently limited to two electric bicycles, the folding $1,195 Traveler and the $995 Fun. Both are sold by 26 distributors and at www.thinkmobility.com.</p>
        <p>''The target buyers are people who have quit riding because they can't keep up with the kids,'' said Rob Stevens, president of Think Mobility.</p>
        <p>But come June, Think will offer a third American product, the Neighbor, a two- or four-seat vehicle that is best described as a glorified golf cart. It has headlamps, turn signals and other road accessories, and in many states can travel on roads with speed limits below 35 m.p.h.</p>
        <p>Think executives say they think the Neighbor, which will sell for $6,000 to $8,000, will find buyers in self-contained housing developments, retirement communities and corporate campuses. ''We expect the Neighbor will be our big seller,'' said John Wallace, executive director of the Think Group, who points to the 78 million baby boomers approaching retirement age.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Wallace's projections are correct, Think will sell 1,500 Neighbors this year -- a tiny number in Detroit terms, but one that would exceed the total number of electric vehicles (1,264) sold or leased in all of 1999.</p>
        <p>An American version of the City, due in 2002, may be a hard sell. It costs $25,000 in Europe, but ''we realize that is not the right price point for the U.S.,'' Mr. Wallace said. He estimated $10,000 to $15,000 to be more appropriate. At that level, he projects first-year sales ''in the low thousands.''</p>
        <p>The plastic-body City is fully road-legal and can reach 56 m.p.h., Ford says, making it barely capable of highway cruising. The company says it can travel 53 miles on an eight-hour charge. In contrast, the hybrid-power Honda Insight, which sells for about $20,000 and is classified as an ultra-low-emission vehicle, can travel around 500 miles on a tank of gasoline.</p>
        <p>The success of both the City and the Neighbor depend heavily on tax breaks and on consumer interest in California; indeed, Think Mobility recently moved from Dearborn. Mich., to the San Diego area. The staff of the state's Air Resources Board recently proposed that 2 percent of the cars on sale, starting in 2003, be ''zero emission vehicles''; until fuel-cell cars powered by hydrogen gas are practical, only battery-powered electric vehicles will meet that standard.</p>
        <p>Last month's proposed changes struck a blow to Think's plans by reducing California's inducements to manufacturers who offer small vehicles like the Neighbor and the City, while increasing the credits for hybrid-power and fuel-cell vehicles. According to Jerry Martin, the board's director of communications, the fear is that the market will be flooded by short-range vehicles that cannot be driven on freeways. Then, he said, car companies could point to disappointing sales of such vehicles and assert that there is no market for purely electric cars.</p>
        <p>Namrita Kapur, an emerging-energy analyst at Adams, Harkness &amp; Hill, a Boston investment bank, said the board's proposal could hurt the prospects for Think's Neighbor and City. ''If Think is 100 percent battery electric, A.R.B.'s ruling could hurt their marketability in 2003,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Think Technologies is moving ahead with development of a fuel-cell vehicle for 2004. This car, based on the Ford Focus FC5 test vehicle, will be equipped with a compact Ballard Power Systems fuel cell.</p>
        <p>Think also provides engineering expertise for environmental vehicles that will bear Ford's name, like a hybrid-electric version of the Ford Escape sport utility, which is to go on sale in 2003. It is likely to outsell any of Think's own battery vehicles, giving the upstart division a sense of purpose beyond its own profitability -- or lack of it.</p>
