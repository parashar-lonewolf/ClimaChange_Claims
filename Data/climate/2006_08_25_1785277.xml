        <p>Jill E. Burwell, Mt. Morris, Mich.: Maybe people like my husband and me dont show up in the polls, but we have spent considerable time discussing infrastructure in the U.S.A. One would have to be blind not to see the decay everywhere. Our pet peeve is the state of railroading. We know the technology exists, because other countries have done it, to make railroads a dynamic part of our transportation system. Using railroads at full potential would remove many of the big trucks which prematurely destroy roads and clog highway traffic.</p>
        <p>I would be willing to have my taxes raised if the rich also give up their recent super tax cuts and pay tolls if it meant good roads, dependable electricity, ongoing research for clean, alternative power sources, a super railroad system to move goods around the country and the all the jobs created to get this work done. No more earmarks! As suggested, we need a bipartisan strategy, that combines public and private efforts, for bringing Americas infrastructure into the new millennium. A+ to The New York Times for focusing on this issue.</p>
        <p>Daniel OConnell, Phoenix: I agree wholeheartedly with your claims concerning the necessity of upgraded infrastructures both in the realms of transportation and communication for a competitive and productive future in the United States. How long can the U.S. afford to ignore the potential benefits of more developed railway infrastructures both within cities and regions and between them? Traffic, pollution, and extreme drains on water and other resources are all being caused by the cars driven and endless urban sprawling occurring in so many American cities today. Phoenix is now much like L.A. There are thousands of people who live more than 20 to 30 miles from where they work. People continue to push farther out from the city to chase cheap housing, their own plot of land. However, as these thousands of people commute to downtown Phoenix for work, streets and highways experience what are now considered normal backups that are near gridlocks for hours at time. And this is fueling the push for even more and even wider streets and highways. The U.S. and Phoenix must break this dependence on cars and highways. Railways and better urban planning and reorganization must become factors if Americans are to remain both economically competitive and environmentally conscious.</p>
        <p>Lukas Rosenthaler, Allschwil, Switzerland: One piece of infrastructure thats often overlooked are the railroads. While Europe and Asia invest large sums into the railroads, Americas railroads often look like those in Third World countries. The dismal state of Amtrak is basically due to a grossly negligent disinterest by the government, but also the freight-only lines are often in a rotten state. During the 1970s, many railroad lines were abandoned, single-tracked etc., and maintenance has been neglected. This capacity is missing now and a quick fix is not possible. Facing ever increasing prices of oil, facing terrorist threats to the airline industry where each plane can be turned into a flying bomb, passenger rail must become again a valuable option for travel.</p>
        <p>Daniel Gottlieb, Vermont: I appreciate your insightful and largely balanced comments. However, you dont discuss efficiency or the goal. Is the goal to reduce traffic time to zero? If so, we just need triple the number of roads, costing us billions, reducing quality of life, guaranteeing auto dependence and increasing sprawl. What were doing now, just reacting, clearly isnt the right solution. ... Its often cheaper overall to pay people to use less than to collectively pay for additional infrastructure. The advantages of getting by with less are manifold reduced energy dependency, less pollution, reduced global warming, better Q.O.L. etc. Building more is sometimes the right way to go, but certainly not always. Its time we think outside the box or perhaps just exhibit a bit of Yankee frugality.</p>
        <p>Nicholas Kulish responds: Good points, all. I am a big supporter of public transportation and both commuter and freight trains. Energy-efficient transportation is an important goal for our society, as are combating sprawl and cutting back fuel consumption. But we still need good roads. It will take a lot of work to change the driving culture in America.</p>
        <p>Alan Walker, Toronto: I read the posted article and agree with its direction. I do have to comment, as a recent visitor to the Northeast states. We drove from Toronto through New York state, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Whether an interstate, a toll road, and in particular secondary highways, we were hugely impressed by the quality and condition of the roads. We were wandering from New York City suburbs, to the major interstates, to quiet byways. All were in superb condition, regrettably far superior to roads in Canada.</p>
        <p>Nell Painter, Newark, N.J.: Thank you so much for talking about this! After a trip to Tokyo in 2004 I returned to the N.Y./N.J. metropolitan region, where thank you for your patience signs were everywhere, especially around crucial public transportation. I felt like I lived in a Third World country.</p>
        <p>Christos Talanoz, Munich: Excellent piece. I was born in Germany, but educated in the United States. It was the United States that taught me about being pro-active and thinking ahead. Surprising then that so many European and Asian countries seem like space age societies when it comes to comparing their infrastructure to Americas. I just dont understand it. However, I do think it really boils down to public policy. If Americans would just set their priorities a tad differently, there would be no talk about crumbling infrastructure or crumbling health care.</p>
        <p>America has some of the smartest people in the world. All you need now is a government that sets priorities a bit smarter as well! The people who say let private firms take care of all of this are simply wrong. The private sector must thrive, but government must do the infrastructure things which do not pay off in the short term.</p>
        <p>I think that is what it boils down to : There is this American myth that everything government does is bad. It is created by the conservative government itself. Why ? The myth allows the government to take tax payer money, not spend it on its people and get away with it. The myth allows government to fraudulently pour tax payer money into a few big private pockets, with everyone just shrugging their shoulders saying, See, I told you government is incompetent. That is unacceptable and you must demand that the formidable resources of the U.S. government be put to good use to support the wider economic interest of the people of the United States.</p>
        <p>Nicholas Kulish responds: I think Americans became complacent in part because our infrastructure used to be so good. We have a hard time imagining that we might have somehow slipped behind the rest of the world. But Ive seen testimony before Congress that China is pumping $60 billion into its high-speed Internet network each year. My colleague here at The Times, Amy Waldman, wrote a series on the new highways India is building. Increasingly, were lagging behind the pack. If we dont reverse the trend it will come back to haunt us. Sounds like the Canadians are having some trouble too.</p>
        <p>Richard Pasquier, Wynnewood, Pa.: I was glad to see the topic of our declining infrastructure tackled by a member of the New York Times Editorial Board. I have made improving infrastructure and devising means for making the necessary investments affordable for the nation a personal crusade of mine. In my opinion, there will be no improvement in our national efforts unless we consider alternative funding arrangements to our current budget process. And mere capital budgeting is not enough. I suggest that we return to the model of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (R.F.C.), the institution used from the 1930s through the 1950s to build much of the infrastructure referred to in the article.</p>
        <p>Nicholas Kulish responds: I havent studied the R.F.C., but have seen it criticized for excessive bureaucracy during the Hoover Administration. Maybe thats a bad rap though. When I was an economics reporter at The Wall Street Journal, my boss, Jacob M. Schlesinger, believed that President Hoover was unappreciated and underestimated. Im in favor of exploring any new model for deploying our resources effectively.</p>
        <p>Margaret Meredith, Maastricht, The Netherlands: Im thrilled to see that someone affiliated with an established institution ... finally noticed that the nations infrastructure is literally falling apart. I noticed years ago when I lived in Washington D. C. that the citys infrastructure was in terrible shape. It is our nations capital, after all. I moved to San Diego where there is still a lot of investment in the citys infrastructure, largely because of its rapid growth. Every time I return to the east coast or drive from it to the west coast, Im shocked by the state of the infrastructure. Our streets, highways, and mass transportation systems are precisely what make it possible to build and live in our society. Our lives and livelihoods depend on them. They are thus unavoidably a vital public good. The problem is, as the author said, the issue of their upkeep makes voters yawn. But I would argue that the reason it does so is the fault of our congressmen and political leaders over the last 30 years, Democrats and Republicans alike, who have failed to make it their responsibility to keep it on the public agenda. Why? Because it translates into higher taxes and lost elections....</p>
        <p>Lee Bartkowski, Long Beach, Calif.: Youll recall that Ross Perot suggested a 0.50 per gallon infrastructure tax during his campaign, and you know how much traction that got. I dont know the answer, but state and federal fuel taxes are already earmarked for highways. I like the idea of tolls bridges, freeways, etc. you pay as you go. I think until the involvement in Iraq is concluded, infrastructure will be a tough sell. Then a public service announcement blitz can begin citing the necessity to take care of ourselves for a while. Messages like, Wouldnt it be nice if the U.S. had roads and bridges as nice as those in France?</p>
        <p>Nicholas Kulish responds: I had forgotten about Mr. Perots proposal. We would certainly be in a lot better shape if something like that had gone through, but Im not sure middle-class commuters would have let Congress pass it. But Perot at least would have taken it to the voters and tried to explain it to them in plain, frank language. Thats what we need right now. Infrastructure was getting a lot more attention in the early 1990s than it does now. Sadly its still off the radar for most people.</p>
        <p>Diana Collins, Charlotte, N.C.: Yes I agree we need to make a lot of investments in our infrastructure, but it will never happen. People cant see beyond the end of their own nose these days. And if a number of people could see the benefit of investment in infrastructure, the Republicans are always there to shoot down anything that would benefit the country.</p>
        <p>They only like projects that are sure to bankrupt the nation, like a good old war we cant win! This country will crumble, and it will be left behind in every sense. Get used to the idea, and blame the cheapskates.</p>
        <p>Lawrence Light, Mission Viejo, Calif.: Thus far, the current administration has siphoned off the monies required to repair our infrastructure by spending on the Iraq war, agreeing to vast amounts of defense spending, creating an environment in which oil prices can rise as high as the oil companies would like, creating tax breaks for a very small segment of the population that must be made up by the rest if any money is to be raised. Sure, your editorial piece says it nicely but I can see no way that the pigs who have been so accustomed to using the government trough will ever give up such a lucrative conduit for this kind of money. Perhaps when the oceans rise six to twelve inches or a military draft is instituted or oil hits $200 a barrel will any action be taken and, by then, it may be too late.</p>
        <p>David J. Andrews, New York.: There is no hope of fixing Americas broken infrastructure as long as we are embracing the tax-cut and make war policies of the Bush administration. We really cant have it both ways costly tax cuts for the rich, make-believe wars on terrorism and unbelievable graft and corruption all add up to one inescapable conclusion: America will be left to disintegrate while the rich get richer and the world becomes more hostile to what we used to think of as American values. We really are the dumbest people on Earth.</p>
        <p>Nicholas Kulish responds: I wish the money we have spent and are going to spend on the Iraq war had been used instead on American infrastructure but Im not so sure that would have happened. Its just as likely that the difference would have gone toward repealing the estate tax or missile defense. If anything is going to happen on this issue though I think its going to have to be approached in a nonpartisan manner. The business community could be a strong voice and one that Republicans would listen to in favor of improving our physical network. A strong, productive country should resonate with voters and interest groups from both parties, with the exception of the drown-government-in-the-bathtub crowd.</p>
        <p>J. Kelly Conklin, Glen Ridge, N.J.: There is one important issue unmentioned in Nicholas Kulishs piece. Who will do the work? Who will put up the forms, pour the concrete, run the pipe and the wire? Who will form the steel and run the track? In the future advocated by our national leaders, they will have to be imported. The guest worker program our president is proposing is no accident it is a necessity.</p>
        <p>In a recent Times Magazine article about the re-emergence of nuclear power, it was mentioned in passing that we lack the capacity in this country to build the huge steel vessels required for a nuclear reactor. The point being that, that inadequate capacity could be an impediment to expanding our nuclear power generating capacity. You think?</p>
        <p>Despite the obvious need for skilled, well-trained and motivated workers to do the sweaty, dirty and physically demanding work that road construction, tunnel digging and reactor building require, we as a nation do less with every passing year to prepare and encourage that work force to develop. Only those left behind need apply; the smart and able are off to college. ...</p>
