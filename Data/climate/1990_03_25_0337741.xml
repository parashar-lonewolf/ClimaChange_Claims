        <p>LEAD: This is in response to Dan Harrison's attack on County Legislator Paul Feiner's introduction of legislation to ban styrofoam food containers in Westchester [Letters to the Westchester Editor, Feb. 18] .</p>
        <p>This is in response to Dan Harrison's attack on County Legislator Paul Feiner's introduction of legislation to ban styrofoam food containers in Westchester [Letters to the Westchester Editor, Feb. 18] .</p>
        <p>I read with amazement the spirited defense of the food-packaging industry's ''removal'' of CFC [chlorofluorocarbon]  from plastic foam packaging at the end of 1988. This would lead the casual reader to deduce that the substitutes are not harmful to the environment.</p>
        <p>What Mr. Harrison unfortunately fails to mention is the HCFC's [H for hydrogen]  that substitute for the CFC's also deplete the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>Five years of destroying ozone may constitute an improvement, but ozone is still being destroyed while we consume the rapidly depleting petroleum reserves for fast-food containers and 30 billion disposable foam hot drink cups each year. (Another substitute for CFC's is pentane; however, most manufactuers are reluctant to use that because it is explosive.) Mr. Harrison also tried to focus our attention on the percent weight the styrofoam contributes to the solid-waste problem rather than the volume it takes up.</p>
        <p>Landfills throughout the country are reaching capacity because of volume, not weight. However, whether one looks at the volume or the weight, the point is that plastic packaging and styrofoam are still garbage.</p>
        <p>And 500 years from now it will still be garbage, looking the same as it does today.</p>
        <p>Some people think that incineration is the answer. Industry has claimed that burning polystyrene produces ''virtually nothing'' but carbon dioxide and water vapor.</p>
        <p>The Center for Fire Research at the National Bureau of Standards published a list of 57 chemicals that result from burning styrofoam in laboratory tests. It is not known how many of these combustion products result during actual incineration, but the evidence does challenge industry's definition of ''virtually nothing.''</p>
        <p>If we are to make informed choices about the future of our environment, we need facts, not the ''technical truths'' with which Mr. Harrison tries to defend the plastics-packaging industry.</p>
        <p>It is time for us to say no to excess packaging and encourage our county legislators to follow the lead of an ever-increasing number of municipalities throughout the nation that are putting the environment ahead of convenience (and profits for the plastic-packaging industry).</p>
