        <p>Like Nelson, Like Nephew</p>
        <p>While troops of national reporters were camped out in Albany waiting to hear whether Gov. Mario M. Cuomo would make a last-minute entry in the New Hampshire primary late last year, another New Yorker with a famous political name was wrestling with the same decision -- and was finally talked out of it by the White House.</p>
        <p>The would-be candidate was Laurance Rockefeller, 47 years old, an environmental lawyer and nephew of the late Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, and the primary he wound up forgoing was the Republican</p>
        <p>vice</p>
        <p>presidential contest.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Rockefeller prepared filing papers and agonized up until the end about whether to run. But unlike Mr. Cuomo, he did so privately. Details of the non-campaign have emerged in a somewhat self-deprecating essay about his short-lived political career, "On New Hampshire and CO  ."</p>
        <p>Under a quirk of New Hampshire law, residents are able to vote on a separate line for vice president. Since no other state has the provision, the contest means little. But Mr. Rockefeller and several other Republican environmentalists -- including Theodore (Ted) Roosevelt 4th, a Manhattan investment banker -- seriously explored entering the primary to protest what they said they believed was the Bush Administration's failure to address global warming.</p>
        <p>The environmentalists settled on Mr. Rockefeller, he writes, in part because he had "crisscrossed New Hampshire for a month leading up to the 1964 primary, organizing students for my Uncle Nelson and campaigning myself."</p>
        <p>As word of the budding campaign filtered to Washington, Mr. Rockefeller was summoned to the White House on the night before the Dec. 20 New Hampshire deadline to meet with the White House chief of staff, Samuel K. Skinner, and Mr. Bush's campaign chairman, Robert M. Teeter. Among other things, the officials argued that the insurgent campaign "might lead the President to feel he didn't get enough credit from environmentalists and lose interest rather than being encouraged to do better," Mr. Rockefeller wrote.</p>
        <p>As the minutes ticked by and Mr. Cuomo was hand-wringing himself out of the race, Mr. Rockefeller was doing much the same. One reason, he said, was that Mr. Skinner was new on the job and deserved a chance to stake out a more concerned position on global warming than his predecessor, John H. Sununu; another was that Dan Quayle was not listed on the ballot so "no real contest was possible."</p>
        <p>So Mr. Rockefeller pulled back, although he sent a long note to the President expressing concern about his environmental policies that quickly drew letters from Mr. Bush, Mr. Skinner and Mr. Teeter, all pledging to re-examine the issue. Mr. Teeter's note not only expressed relief that Mr. Rockefeller, who lives in Manhattan, would not be running in the New Hampshire primary, but also added that he was "even more pleased that your Governor has decided to take a pass."</p>
        <p>In the end, the vice presidential contest in New Hampshire was won by Herb Clark Jr., a political gadfly from Concord. In one little-noted phenomenon, though, Mr. Quayle actually drew 6,613 write-in votes in the contest, 36 more write-in votes than Mr. Cuomo received in the Democratic Presidential primary. Conservatives Are Hedging</p>
        <p>As if the threat of revolt from the left were not enough for President Bush, the success of Patrick J. Buchanan in New Hampshire has now emboldened the Conservative Party in New York State to threaten to withhold its endorsement for this fall's election.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush drew 243,457 votes on the Conservative line in the 1988 presidential election. While that was only about one-tenth of his vote total as a Republican, the Conservative ballot line could provide a critical margin in a close election.</p>
        <p>But Michael R. Long, the party chairman, hedged in an interview on giving Mr. Bush the 1992 line, saying he wanted to see several cabinet members replaced with conservatives and a renewed "no new taxes" pledge from the President first.</p>
        <p>Mr. Long said Bush campaign officials had asked him recently whether the "door was closed" to the Conservative nomination. "I said no," he recounted, "but it's not exactly wide open either." Keeping Options Open</p>
        <p>A scramble is under way in the Connecticut General Assembly to fill two legislative auditors' posts that were last vacant when Lyndon Johnson was President. The problem, which threatens to raise tensions among both the majority Democrats and minority Republicans, is that at least half a dozen lawmakers are interested in the jobs, but state law prohibits any of them from even being nominated while serving in the Legislature.</p>
        <p>For the would-be applicants, including both Deputy Speakers of the House, the options are sticky. They could resign from their jobs now, to be nominated without guarantee of confirmation. Or they could push the leadership to name temporary auditors, then wait to see how they do in the general election in November, when voter anger about taxes and the recession is expected to sweep many legislators onto the street. Or they could push to scrap the restriction and allow open nominations.</p>
        <p>Still another option is to stall until the regular session ends in May, when leaders in the House and Senate could fill the $74,000-a-year jobs on their own from outside the legislature. The wrinkle is that any job filled this summer would have to be ratified next January by the full legislature.</p>
