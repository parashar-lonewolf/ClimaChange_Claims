        <p>AS it has through the ages, Mars, the nearest planetary neighbor to the Earth, maintains a strange fascination for people and has long been a coveted destination for the more imaginative.</p>
        <p>Whether spurred by science fiction or tantalizing hints of past life in ancient Martian rocks, many people seem to feel that inevitably, humans will someday set foot on the red planet, first to visit, then to stay.</p>
        <p>Quietly, and often unnoticed, scientists and engineers are putting together plans and the technology to make such dreams a reality. At several National Aeronautics and Space Administration centers, and at universities and aerospace companies, small-scale studies are under way on differing bits of technology that could come together to send the first human crew to Mars early in the next century.</p>
        <p>New approaches being examined for a Mars trip -- using lighter, partly inflatable ships, developing closed systems to recycle wastes and produce food, and making rocket fuel on Mars instead of hauling it from Earth -- show promise for making the venture safer and more cost-effective, proponents say.</p>
        <p>Because there is no political mandate for a human mission to Mars, NASA is approaching the possibility cautiously and with little fanfare. The agency is sponsoring several low-cost research projects aimed at identifying technologies that could be used and readying blueprints for an endeavor, should one be called for.</p>
        <p>''I don't know of another event that would inspire our imaginations or stimulate our innate feelings for exploration more'' than such a journey, said Daniel S. Goldin, the agency Administrator. But he emphasized that such planning was tentative.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldin, who has spoken often of his dream that people would one day go to Mars, says that in the next five or six years, he wants his agency to lay the groundwork for such a venture. At the end of that period, he said, criteria for the mission should be solid enough for NASA to show the President or Congress how to accomplish it within 8 to 10 years of setting a starting date.</p>
        <p>Four questions must be resolved before there can be a serious human Mars proposal, Mr. Goldin said: Can people live and work in space for the two to four years required? Is there a compelling scientific reason for people to go? Can the journey be made for a relatively low cost? Should the United States conduct the mission alone or as part of an international project?</p>
        <p>To address these questions, NASA officials said, the agency has been spending $5 million to $10 million a year on studies directly related to human exploration beyond Earth orbit. Additionally, other projects in the agency's $14 billion annual budget, including research related to the forthcoming international space station, could aid a human Mars mission.</p>
        <p>Human journeys to the red planet have been proposed before, but they were stymied by their sheer size and enormous projected costs. In 1989, while celebrating the 20th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing, President George Bush proposed sending an expedition to Mars in the first decades of the next century. But when NASA and others estimated the cost at $450 billion to $500 billion, the proposal withered.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Bush found very quickly that there was no rationale for a manned Mars mission,'' said Dr. Louis D. Friedman, executive director of the Planetary Society, a group based in Pasadena, Calif., that advocates space exploration. ''And no one got behind it, neither Congress nor the people.''</p>
        <p>But things are changing, say Dr. Friedman and other experts. First, the cost estimates for a Mars expedition have dropped sharply in the past few years and should continue to fall as researchers explore new ways of doing things, they say. Recent estimates by NASA engineers put the cost of sending six astronauts to Mars on a two- to three-year mission at about $55 billion, only about 10 percent of the projection a decade ago.</p>
        <p>In addition, proponents say, the public is showing a renewed fascination with Mars as debate simmers on whether a meteorite from Mars found in Antarctica harbored microscopic evidence of ancient life and as plans move forward for a series of low-cost, unmanned spacecraft.</p>
        <p>Some space experts hold that robots are the best way to explore Mars. But Mr. Goldin and others said initial studies may turn up tasks that only humans can do well. If the possibility of finding Martian life or subsurface water requires deep drilling, it may require the adaptability and intelligence of humans, they said.</p>
        <p>''I have a strong feeling there will be things that a robot can't do,'' Mr. Goldin said.</p>
        <p>Some of the technology under consideration for Mars likely will be tested on the international space station, construction of which is scheduled to begin in orbit later this year. The 470-ton outpost is to be completed around 2004 by the United States, Russia, the European Space Agency, Canada and Japan.</p>
        <p>''The space station is only justified by the idea of a trip to Mars,'' Dr. Friedman of the Planetary Society said. ''Why study the biological effects of long-term space flight on people, and a lot of the other technology, if you are not going to go somewhere?''</p>
        <p>One major change being considered for the space station has an important potential Martian application. NASA has issued a stop-work order on a long-planned habitat module being build by the Boeing Company as a major American contribution to the station and is considering substituting a lighter, inflatable unit called TransHab. The pressurized habitat, one of six principal compartments of the station, is to house the living quarters and much of the equipment for American astronauts on the outpost.</p>
        <p>NASA officials said they would decide by the end of the year whether to continue work on the original module or to go with the new concept. The cost estimate of either option, to be launched to the station in 2003, is about $100 million, they said.</p>
        <p>Instead of having a metal case, TransHab would have a light-weight core made of composite materials surrounded by a shell composed of layers of puncture-resistant fabric, like the cloth used for bullet-proof vests.</p>
        <p>If borne out by testing, the technology of TransHab, a term derived from combining the words ''transportation'' and ''habitat,'' could used to make living quarters on the Moon or Mars, as well as aboard an interplanetary ship, said engineers at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, where the concept is being developed.</p>
        <p>''We're designing a space-inflatable habitat that is safer, cheaper and better than anything currently in the works,'' said Donna Fender, the project manager at Johnson. ''We are not designing Mars hardware, but my goal is to provide an inflatable habitat for the space station that could be used without major redesign to go to Mars.''</p>
        <p>The module would be compressed around its 11-foot-diameter core when carried to the station by a space shuttle. When released, its inflatable pressure shell would expand into a unit 25 feet in diameter and 26 feet long. The module, as tall as a three-story building, would house separate quarters for four to six people.</p>
        <p>The TransHab, weighing about five tons empty, would be some 50 percent lighter than the planned Boeing model while providing three times the internal volume. Because of the weight reduction, it can be sent to the station fully equipped instead of being outfitted afterwards, as planned for other station modules, project engineers say. The added space could have multiple uses, from testing large pieces of equipment to recreation, and would provide room for added protection from space radiation, they say.</p>
        <p>The design calls for surrounding the central living quarters with a water jacket. Water stops the penetration of radioactive particles, such as cosmic rays and ions from solar flares, and a 4-to-6-inch-thick layer would form a radiation ''storm cellar'' for astronauts that was not provided for in current plans for the station, Ms. Fender said. Such a radiation shield would be particularly useful on an interplanetary trip or on Mars, which, unlike Earth, has no magnetic field to trap solar radiation above the planet.</p>
        <p>Other technology in the works focuses on regenerative life support systems that can recycle wastes while producing oxygen and food for space travelers. NASA engineers working with the Advanced Life Support Program, also headquartered at the Johnson center, say they have made great strides in developing a bioreactor that uses microbes to clean waste water before it is filtered through a conventional reverse-osmosis purification system.</p>
        <p>Dr. Don L. Henninger, head of the life-support program at Johnson, said the program completed a 91-day test in December in which four participants in a sealed chamber proved that such a system was feasible. The biological system allowed recovery of 99 percent of potable water, he said, processing a total of 2,300 gallons of water from the 210 gallons originally stowed aboard.</p>
        <p>For the first time in such a test, engineers used an incinerator to recycle fecal waste, recovering carbon dioxide and water vapor used to nourish wheat and lettuce growing in an adjacent chamber. The wheat, in turn, produced 25 percent of the oxygen used by the crew.</p>
        <p>''We've come so far with this technology that we think we are ready to put some of it on the space station,'' Dr. Henninger said. ''The station can be a testbed for our system while at the same time the system can reduce consumables that have to be taken to the station.''</p>
        <p>The regenerative system has obvious implications for a Mars trip, because it would be expensive and impractical to take along all of the food, water and other consumable items that the crew would need without recycling it, he said.</p>
        <p>The program is planning to build a large research unit known as Bio-plex to test the idea of a completely contained, closed system that can sustain a crew for more than a year. The unit, which would include two modules just for plant production, is being designed to sustain a crew of four with no outside equipment or support, as would be required on the Moon or Mars, Dr. Henninger said.</p>
        <p>''Our job is to be ready with the technology when it is needed,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Representative F. James Sensenbrenner, the Wisconsin Republican who is chairman of the House Science Committee, said NASA's current spending on manned Mars work was adequate. ''NASA has enough to do now just trying to build the space station and I don't see an interest in starting the wheels into motion for Mars right now,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Advocates of human space flight were disturbed last month by an internal NASA memorandum that appeared to call for an end to studies of future human missions to the Moon and Mars. But Representative Dave Weldon, Republican of Florida, calling such a cut short-sighted, said last week that he received assurances from Mr. Goldin that these studies would continue, heartening proponents of Mars exploration.</p>
        <p>''NASA should accelerate the ground work for a Mars mission now,'' said Dr. Robert M. Zubrin, president of Pioneer Astronautics, a private space research company in Indian Hills, Colo. ''Their current plans are an enormous step forward from a decade ago when they were talking about a $450 billion price tag, but I think it still could be done cheaper and faster. If done correctly, the cost goes down and that increases the possibility of its political acceptance.''</p>
