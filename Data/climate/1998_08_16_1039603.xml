        <p>Postcard views of snow-covered peaks, sparkling lakes and emerald pine forests surround this resort town 7,800 feet up in the Eastern Sierra. But to the dismay of residents, when the nation's attention is drawn to their town next to the Mammoth Mountain ski resort, it most often focuses on what is going on underground.</p>
        <p>The town of about 5,000 people sits in the Long Valley Caldera, a 20-mile-long volcanic basin. After four magnitude 6 earthquakes struck the area in 1980, geologists found that new inflows of magma miles underground had caused a bulge in the caldera surface, which sometimes signals a volcanic eruption.</p>
        <p>The result for years afterward: news reports that residents complain exaggerated the risk of an eruption and that damaged the town's economy and real estate values.</p>
        <p>''The news media has just devastated this community,'' said Rodger Guffey, who has owned a Mammoth Lakes restaurant for 28 years. ''If somebody makes a statement, they just use the half that says we're going to blow up.''</p>
        <p>Recently things have turned around, in part because of the resurgence of the Southern California economy. In addition, the Intrawest Corporation, a resort developer, bought 52 percent of Mammoth Mountain Ski Area along with real estate in the town and has plans for $350 million in projects here.</p>
        <p>''They did a lot of looking into everything,'' said an Intrawest spokeswoman, Pam Murphy. ''They didn't see it as a big risk at all.''</p>
        <p>Intrawest and others are investing despite the fact that the town continues to be rocked by earthquakes so often that a television station broadcasts a daily earthquake report.</p>
        <p>Last November, the area was rattled by a swarm of earthquakes centered inside the caldera, including almost a thousand in a single day. That and other swarms that have struck are related to the volcanic unrest, according to the United States Geological Survey.</p>
        <p>Christopher Farrar, a Geological Survey hydrologist studying volcanic phenomena here, said, ''If you had a large earthquake, it could cause a ground fracture of considerable size and open a pathway that could allow magma to come to the surface.''</p>
        <p>The agency's scientists said that the area around Mammoth Lakes and around the Cascade Range in the Pacific Northwest were the two places in the continental United States most likely to produce a volcanic eruption. But they cannot predict when an eruption will happen or how severe it might be.</p>
        <p>''The upshot is that the odds of something happening in any given year are roughly one in a few hundred,'' said David P. Hill, a Geological Survey seismologist. ''It's typical of the geologic hazards of living on the West Coast.''</p>
        <p>But because there has never been a serious injury or even much damage from the earthquakes here, and because the last volcanic eruption in the area occurred 250 years ago, most residents feel secure.</p>
        <p>''People are willing to gamble quite a bit on the 99 percent chance that something is going to go their way,'' Mr. Farrar said. ''But the more years that go by with periods of increased activity and no eruption, pretty soon you're going to get to the point where the earth system is ready to produce an eruption, and that's what will happen.''</p>
        <p>That is the kind of talk that angers many residents, who are far more fearful of renewed damage to the economy from media attention.</p>
        <p>Mayor Kirk Stapp of Mammoth Lakes said: ''Some people in Mammoth are absolutely hysterical about defending the town. They're very hostile -- some people's livelihood is at stake and they become very emotional and very angry.''</p>
        <p>Their cause has not been helped by a series of strong earthquakes since June, including two of magnitude 5.3. And in recent years, a new problem has seeped up through the ground. In about a hundred acres at the base of Mammoth Mountain, carbon dioxide gas released by underground magma has emerged and collected in soil, killing swaths of pine trees. The gas can collect at high concentrations in depressions in dirt or snow in that area, and can be dangerous to anyone breathing below ground or snow level, Mr. Farrar said.</p>
