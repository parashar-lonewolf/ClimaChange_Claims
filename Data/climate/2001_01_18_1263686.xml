        <p>Scientists from 150 governments began a four-day meeting here today to try to agree on what latest evidence of global warming should be used as the basis to set global environmental policies.</p>
        <p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an organization of hundreds of scientists that the United Nations created in 1988 to assess warming, has drafted a thick report that doubles the top end of the temperature increase predicted over the next century, by 11 degrees.</p>
        <p>The meeting here is the first of several to fine-tune a summary of that report to be used by governments in negotiating a climate treaty. The report updates the organization's latest assessment of global warming, in 1995, and suggests an acceleration of the trends that have caused alarm among environmentalists. The draft finds that the warming in the 20th century was likely to have been the greatest of any century in the last 1,000 years for the Northern Hemisphere and that the 1990's was the warmest decade of the last millennium.</p>
        <p>Rising temperatures have also lengthened the ''freeze-free'' season in many mid- and high-latitude regions, the draft says, and they have cut snow cover since the 1960's by 10 percent. The rate at which the sea level rose in the last century was 10 times faster than the average rate over the last 3,000 years.</p>
        <p>The findings add urgency to treaty negotiations aimed at carrying out the reductions in greenhouse gases stipulated by the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, a treaty signed by more than 100 countries, but not ratified by any industrialized nations. The latest round of talks ended without an agreement in November in the Netherlands, and today dissension rippled through the conference hall.</p>
        <p>Greenpeace argues that scientific evidence is being ignored by industrialized nations reluctant to enact costly policies to cut emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Chinese representatives complained that the forum ignored the views of scientists who discount evidence of global warming as part of normal climatic fluctuations or cast doubt on the effects of carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>''The organization is supposed to report objectively, but it now tends to fix the conclusion first and then find evidence to support that conclusion,'' said Lu Xuedu, a delegate from the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.</p>
        <p>Among Beijing's objections to the 1,000-page summary report, from which China's contribution was left out, Mr. Lu said, is the finding that the increase in greenhouse gases and associated warming stemmed primarily from human activities, a contention that bears directly on the coal-dependent power generation that drives China's economic development.</p>
        <p>China, nonetheless, is working to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by adding power plants fueled by natural gas, water or nuclear energy, said Gao Feng, deputy director general of the Treaty and Law Department of the Foreign Ministry. Mr. Gao said China had cut its coal production, to 992 million tons in 1999 from 1.4 billion in 1996.</p>
        <p>China continues to show relatively low gas emissions per capita. North America and Western Europe are the largest contributors, with the United States being the largest of all.</p>
        <p>A far greater number of proposed challenges to the summary report came from the American Petroleum Institute and oil companies like ExxonMobil, as well as from delegates from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.</p>
