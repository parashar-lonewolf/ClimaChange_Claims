        <p>LEAD: The alarm sounds aboard the nuclear-powered cruiser Long Beach: ''This is a drill. Fire in the forward port berthing compartment. Fire party, fire party.''</p>
        <p>The alarm sounds aboard the nuclear-powered cruiser Long Beach: ''This is a drill. Fire in the forward port berthing compartment. Fire party, fire party.''</p>
        <p>A dozen Navy firefighters race to an equipment locker. Behind them, watertight doors slam shut. The firefighters wiggle into fireproof coveralls, don red steel helmets and pull on oxygen masks.</p>
        <p>In a darkened compartment a drill team in yellow T-shirts simulates the fire. Two sailors flash red lanterns to signify flames, another flaps a gray blanket for black smoke, still another fluffs a white sheet for white smoke. Charred clothing and bedding have been scattered about.</p>
        <p>Perhaps nothing strikes so much fear in a sailor as a fire at sea. No one can escape, as he might from a burning house. Space is tight, making it easy for fire to spread and hard to fight. Sailors compete with the flames for the oxygen. Sailors fight the fire to save their ship and their lives. Heroism Aboard Stark</p>
        <p>In May, after 37 sailors were killed aboard the American warship Stark in the Persian Gulf when the frigate was hit by a missile from an Iraqi warplane, the crew needed almost 24 hours to douse the intense flames for good, finish damage control and treat the wounded, according to the House Armed Services Committee. In a preliminary report, the panel said the actions of the crew were ''heroic.''</p>
        <p>Aboard the Long Beach, talkers begin a running report to the damage control center deep amidships, where it is protected, like the combat center and ammunition magazines. Should there be more than one fire, or flooding, which often accompanies a blaze, the fight to save the ship would be coordinated from there.</p>
        <p>As soon as the fire team is in place, one man feels the door to the burning compartment while another sprays it with a fine cooling mist. The first man cracks the door open enough to allow the inside to be sprayed.</p>
        <p>Then the team leader gives the word, the firefighters tug on their pressurized hoses and charge into the compartment to battle the blaze. Going in with them are an electrician to find switches to cut the power and a medic to look for injured seamen.</p>
        <p>Success in fighting a blaze comes from drill, drill, drill, said the Long Beach's skipper, Capt. Marvin J. Weniger, who calls his firefighters ''the Long Beach Fire Department.'' When Training Paid Off</p>
        <p>The Stark's crew, evidently well trained, suffered no casualties from fighting the fire, the Congressional report said. ''Given the ferocity of and intensity of fires on ships, this is a remarkable achievement,'' it said.</p>
        <p>Firefighting on the Stark was hampered because the missiles had ruptured the water main on the port side. That required rigging hoses from the aft water mains. Moreover, the crew reported that the fire kept reigniting at new locations.</p>
        <p>''Crew members described the fire as so intense that it eventually began to melt portions of the superstructure and decking,'' the report said. Some estimated that the temperature in some compartments reached 1,800 degrees.</p>
        <p>''Crew members said the amount and density of the smoke generated by the fires kept them from isolating the source of the fire for several hours and combined to block all visibility in the adjacent work spaces,'' the report said. From Captain to Seaman</p>
        <p>To teach sailors to fight fire and to control shipboard damage, the Navy operates schools in ports such as San Diego to train every member of a crew, from the captain to the newest seaman.</p>
        <p>In the firefighting school next to the piers here, Chief Warrant Officer Paul D. Hacker said a key step was teaching sailors to identify what kind of fire they were up against so that they used the right techniques.</p>
        <p>Class A fires give off white smoke from burning wood, clothing, mattresses or, grimmest of all, men. Those fires are fought with water.</p>
        <p>Class B fires, produce black smoke from burning oil or paint and are fought with chemical foam.</p>
        <p>Class C fires, are electrical fires fought by cutting off power and dousing the flames with carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>Class D fires are burning magnesium or other metal and are the hardest to fight because they are so hot they turn water to steam. A blaze near ammunition is also classed as a delta fire. A 1982 Sinking Recalled</p>
        <p>The fire aboard the Stark was a Class D fire, as was that aboard the British destroyer Sheffield, which was sunk by an Exocet missile in the war with Argentina over the Falkland Islands in 1982.</p>
        <p>On any ship, Captain Weniger said, citing not only training but the importance of storing flammable materiel properly, ''two-thirds of fighting fire is done before the fire starts.''</p>
        <p>Crewmen are trained to report a fire first, then to shut watertight doors around it. If the fire is bad, the crew is called to battle stations, as sailors were on the Stark. Most important, fire teams must be organized and trained under the direction of a damage control officer.</p>
        <p>Another critical element is overcoming a natural fear of fire. The firefighting school has erected steel structures that look like the superstructure of a ship, a boiler room and an engine room and, for aircraft carriers, a flight deck. Oil is dumped into those buildings and set afire to give sailors the experience of fighting live flames. Every Man a Mission</p>
        <p>Here the firefighters learn teamwork, Mr. Hacker said. Each man is assigned a specific job - nozzleman, hose man, boundary man to keep the watertight doors around the fire closed and extraneous sailors away. Each is rotated through the different assignments.</p>
        <p>In a similar school, Senior Chief Petty Officer Raymond F. Trumpe 3d trains sailors to handle flooding caused by holes in the ship's hull or ruptured pipes, which can be caused by missiles.</p>
        <p>A damage control party of five or six sailors is sent into another set of structures that look like ship compartments. As water under high pressure gushes through holes in the hull and rises around their feet, the sailors place steel plates over the hole, jam wooden beams into place to hold the plates and seal off the water.</p>
        <p>In another drill, the sailors drive wooden wedges into ruptured pipes, place rubber mats over the hole and bind it with heavy twine. Fleeing Through a Flood</p>
        <p>Still another drill teaches sailors to escape a flooding compartment. In a compartment above them a rescue team stands hip-deep in 19 tons of water. The rescue team leader stands atop a hatch in the deck between the two compartments, finding its handle with his feet. Two other rescuers stand on either side of the hatch.</p>
        <p>Signals are passed by thumps on the steel. When both rescuers and trapped sailors are ready, the leader yanks the hatch open and holds it back while the trapped sailors climb up a ladder through the water pouring down on them. Each is hauled away by the two rescuers standing beside the hatch so the next man can climb up.</p>
        <p>Finally, damage control teams are taught to use portable pumps to empty a compartment that has been flooded with seawater or water used to fight fire.</p>
        <p>In the fire aboard the Stark, the ship listed 17 degrees to port because so much water had been pumped in to fight fire. But the crew pumped it out again to save the ship.</p>
