        <p>LEAD: ''I am an environmentalist,'' Vice President Bush declared during the Presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>''I am an environmentalist,'' Vice President Bush declared during the Presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>Last week, the leaders of 30 environmental groups decided to take the President-elect at his word when they presented him with a ''Blueprint for the Environment,'' listing more than 700 recommendations for improving the ecosystem.</p>
        <p>With all the furor this year about polluted beaches, contamination from nuclear weapons production and the greenhouse effect, professing a concern for the environment makes political sense. But some of the environmentalists who met with Mr. Bush last week were encouraged that his interest seemed genuine.</p>
        <p>Though the Vice President did not respond to specific suggestions, the difference between him and President Reagan seemed like ''night and day,'' said Jay D. Hair, president of the National Wildlife Federation. He accused Mr. Reagan of ''ideological shrillness and a lack of commitment to good stewardship of the land.''</p>
        <p>In the meantime, a private group called Project 88, sponsored by Senator Timothy E. Wirth, a Colorado Democrat, and Senator John Heinz, a Pennsylvania Republican, was preparing recommendations on how the Government could give corporations the financial incentives to make environmentalism pay.</p>
        <p>How bad is the environment? These charts show where progress has been made in cleaning up the country's water, land and air, and where serious problems remain.</p>
