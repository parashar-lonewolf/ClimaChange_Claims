        <p>CONTRARY to a commonly held view, the forests of Europe have grown substantially despite a chronic assault by air pollution, according to a study by scientists in Finland.</p>
        <p>Pollution is indeed causing harm, the study says, and could lead to a future long-term decline. But after analyzing a range of recent studies, the Finnish scientists concluded that from 1971 to 1990, the rate of tree growth on the Continent increased by 30 percent and the total volume of wood in tree trunks increased by 25 percent.</p>
        <p>"A decline of forest resources in Europe is a threat for the future, not a historical fact," the Finnish investigators wrote in the current issue of the journal Science. The study was conducted by Dr. Pekka E. Kauppi, Dr. Karl Mielikainen and Dr. Kullervo Kuusela of the Finnish Forest Research Institute in Helsinki.</p>
        <p>The conclusions on the rate of forest growth were based on detailed studies from Finland, France and Sweden, and those on total forest volume on data from Austria, Finland, France, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland. These intensive surveys were supplemented by less detailed assessments from the rest of Europe.</p>
        <p>Some forestry experts, including the authors themselves, say that the lack of definitive data from all but about a third of Europe is a drawback. To extrapolate from a few countries to the rest of the Continent "may be a bit tenuous," said Dr. Peter Duinker, a forestry expert at Lakehead University in Thunder Bay, Ontario, who is familiar with the European situation.</p>
        <p>Moreover, he said, many important signs of pollution-induced forest decline would not necessarily be revealed by simple surveys of forest growth and forest mass because "the complicating factors are enormous." Still, he said, he could not dispute the evidence so far as it goes. Warming Promotes Growth</p>
        <p>Dr. Kauppi and his colleagues cited a number of possible reasons for what they say is the forests' growth, including a warming climate; the fertilizing effect of airborne nitrates; and an increase in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, which is the basic raw material that plants use, in combination with sunlight and water, to manufacture food. Both nitrates and carbon dioxide are produced by the combustion of fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas.</p>
        <p>Potentially, Dr. Kauppi and his colleagues say, these positive influences could lead to similar increases in growing stock and growth rate in other parts of the world.</p>
        <p>But they also said that ultimately, the positive factors could be outweighed by the harmful impact of pollution. They found that deposits of airborne pollutants from the burning of fossil fuels have changed soil chemistry on the Continent in ways that could have long-term adverse effects.</p>
        <p>Because entire forest environments change on a time scale of decades, however, the upward growth trend of the last two decades cannot be reversed in fewer than 5 to 10 years, guaranteeing that forest resources will be plentiful for the next 10 to 20 years, the authors wrote.</p>
        <p>Some of what they say appears to be consistent with some recent findings in the United States. A Federal study ordered by Congress, completed in 1990, concluded that acid rain could stunt forests in the long term by altering soil chemistry, that red spruce at high altitudes was being damaged and that acid rain might be contributing to a decline of sugar maples in Canada. But it found no evidence of an overall forest decline.</p>
        <p>Similarly, preliminary studies by scientists at the New York Botanical Garden have indicated that uncut old-growth forests at the garden's site in the Bronx have continued to function efficiently despite some of the worst pollution in America. The New York scientists warned, however, that such insults could lead to ultimate decline. No Trees Near Smelter</p>
        <p>The Finnish investigators reported that more than 15 percent of Europe's trees were moderately to severely defoliated, though they noted that this does not always indicate decline in a forest stand. Defoliation often takes place naturally in a fast-growing forest as some trees outcompete others.</p>
        <p>The scientists calculated that about 3,100 square miles of forest, or about half a percent of the Continent's total, had been killed by pollution.</p>
        <p>As a particularly extreme instance, they cited the vicinity of the Montshegorsk smelter at Kola, near Murmansk, in northwestern Russia. Emissions of sulfur compounds and heavy metals from the smelter have killed all trees within a radius of three miles, according to the report.  The destruction is the most extensive in the immediate area of any single source of pollution in Europe, the report said. But severe decline like that at Montshegorsk is rare, the scientists concluded.</p>
        <p>Among the factors not included in the Finnish analysis, said Dr. Duinker, is the fact that since World War II, Europe has been engaged in a deliberate effort to build up forest resources to meet the wood demands of a resurgent economy. European foresters also remove a lot of unhealthy-looking trees so that they can be salvaged alive for commercial use, a fact acknowledged by Dr. Kauppi and his colleagues. This "may be masking our ability to detect pollution-induced decline by going in and getting out the trees in worst shape," Dr. Duinker said.</p>
        <p>He also suggested that less severe forest decline than in the 3,100 dead square miles "could be a real phenomenon." There may be 10 times more forests in moderate decline and 100 times more in slight decline, he said.</p>
        <p>"It's like a boxer," he said. "Minor punches could put the guy on the floor after 15 or 20 bouts."</p>
