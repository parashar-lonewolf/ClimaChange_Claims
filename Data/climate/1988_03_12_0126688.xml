        <p>LEAD: Prime Minister Giovanni Goria resigned tonight after his Government split apart over a decision to resume the construction of a nuclear power plant. It was the third time that Mr. Goria had quit since taking office almost eight months ago, but this time his departure seemed final.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Giovanni Goria resigned tonight after his Government split apart over a decision to resume the construction of a nuclear power plant. It was the third time that Mr. Goria had quit since taking office almost eight months ago, but this time his departure seemed final.</p>
        <p>The sudden but not entirely unexpected collapse of the Government heralded a long-awaited political reshuffling. A variety of political figures expressed alarm that the search for a more stable Government would come amid an atmosphere of sharp disagreement and political opportunism.</p>
        <p>The Socialists and their allies, the Social Democrats, abstained Thursday when the Cabinet voted to endorse Mr. Goria's decision to resume the construction of a nuclear power plant north of Rome. Today the Socialists issued a blistering attack on the Government, asserting that the decision by the Cabinet ''had no value'' because Mr. Goria, a Christian Democrat, had grossly overstepped his political authority with ''a forced and inexplicable initiative.'' The youngest man to govern postwar Italy, Mr. Goria, 44 years old, came to office last June after a general election that produced no clear winner in the prolonged joust between the Christian Democrats and the Socialists. When the two major political parties were unable to find the basis for a strong alliance, Mr. Goria, a man with no power base, was chosen to head the Government in what was viewed as an interim appointment.</p>
        <p>Both in November and in February, Mr. Goria resigned when he ran into trouble trying to enact basic tax and budget provisions. On both occasions, President Francesco Cossiga ordered him back to work.</p>
        <p>After the February crisis, Mr. Goria promised that he would resign again as soon as Parliament enacted the long overdue national budget bill for 1988.</p>
        <p>The budget was approved Thursday, and Mr. Goria announced that a ''political clarification,'' meaning his resignation and the search for a more stable Government, would begin a week from today. But his move to step down was hastened by the readiness of the Socialists to pull out of the Government over the issue of the nuclear plant.</p>
        <p>Many of Mr. Goria's difficulties arose from the disorder within his party. The Christian Democrats had agreed to seek an orderly transition that would put the Secretary General of the party, Ciriaco de Mita, in office as the head of a Government with the backing of all five coalition partners.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Goria's resignation, the Christian Democrats and the Socialists, the two major parties in the coalition that has governed Italy for most of the 1980's, appeared headed for another acerbic confrontation.</p>
        <p>The latest dispute arose when Mr. Goria asked the Cabinet to order a resumption of construction work on a nuclear power plant at Montalto di Castro. The plant is two-thirds complete, and Mr. Goria cited the costliness of keeping the project suspended. Last November, in a referendum promoted by the Socialists, Italians voted overwhelmingly to slow Italy's small nuclear energy program. Since then the Government has been investigating the possibility of converting the plant to a site for burning fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>The Socalists today accused Mr. Goria of trying to nullify the referendum with a Cabinet action that ''serves only to make more complicated and difficult the already tormented and confused political situation.''</p>
