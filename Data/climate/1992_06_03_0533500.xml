        <p>IT'S different now, in just half his lifetime, Bobby Bonilla said. He could remember putting together a few dollars to watch the team from his home borough, the Bronx.</p>
        <p>"Reggie could strike out three times, but the fourth time he'd come up they'd be chanting, 'Reggie! Reggie! Reggie!' " Bonilla chose to recall. The wrath of the fans was saved for the Red Sox back in the old days, back in the late 70's, when Bonilla was a kid.</p>
        <p>It was changing even then. You could blame Steinbrenner or you could blame Trump or you could blame Koch or you could blame Watergate or you could blame the yuppies or the homeless or the acid rain, but New York has become a tougher town in every way in the last decade-plus, so why should the ball park be different?</p>
        <p>Bonilla considers himself streetwise about New York, where you shout "Helloooooo!" and the New York Echo replies, "Shut uuuuuuup!" He knows that in the era of the seven-digit salaries, ballplayers who come to New York have about three days to produce before it becomes noisy.</p>
        <p>"Willie Randolph told me everything that could happen," Bonilla said, referring to the man from Brooklyn, who played for the Yankees in the glory days. Willie was blessed by being a stoic infielder who was not expected to hit home runs, but he did encounter pressure from family and friends and fans who spoke the same language.</p>
        <p>"Willie told me it could be rough if you're not going good," Bonilla said. "But Willie also told me this is the greatest place to play. It's true. This is my home. I love New York. Willie prepared me for everything."</p>
        <p>Almost everything. "The earplugs surprised me," Bonilla said, meaning the firestorm that erupted from his sticking a couple of plugs deep in his ears on Saturday. He said he did not expect them to drown out the boos, merely to give him a little margin for concentration. Just an edge. The press and television discovered it in about half an inning, and the earplugs became the instant symbol of his entire $29 million, five-year contract.</p>
        <p>"How did everybody know?" Bonilla asked.</p>
        <p>We know everything, somebody said. He did not wear the plugs Monday night "just to prove a point," which he emphasized by driving in six runs with a stroked single, a ballistic grand slam and a sharp double, for his best night in Shea Stadium as the Mets drubbed the Giants, 14-1. The fans were giving him standing ovations by the end. But you guessed that.</p>
        <p>The moral to the story is that New York is truly different from every other town. You can come in with a sour puss, wishing you were out fishing in Arkansas, the way Kevin McReynolds did, or you can come in with a big smile, the way Bonilla did, and it almost does not matter. New York has become the Goya painting of a crazed god stuffing children into his mouth. New York has become Saturn devouring his own.</p>
        <p>"When I was growing up, we didn't have all these sports," Bonilla said. "We didn't have all those statistics in USA Today, how many times somebody struck out at home."</p>
        <p>That's not exactly true. Some of us can remember glorious summers when the tabloids ran back-page tables comparing Willie, Mickey and the Duke, three center fielders who did not make $29 million among them for their careers. Now we yap 24 hours a day. Man has a bad day, a first caller from New Jersey on the Fan wants to trade his sorry body out of town.</p>
        <p>Has the money really changed it? Whose money is it? Were the beer companies and the television networks and the club owners really going to give it to charity if they did not give it to the ballplayers?</p>
        <p>We've all got itchy trigger fingers these days. Our attention spans are shorter. No sense of humor. Bobby Bonilla did not lay out $21 million for worthless baggage tunnels at Kennedy Airport the way some of our public servants have done. He just went two months without hitting a home run at home. But he kept smiling and he kept hustling and maybe he kept trying too hard.</p>
        <p>"The fans pay money, and if you strike out they boo you; they have that right," Bonilla said.</p>
        <p>He promised he would not let the booing affect him, he would hold no grudges, and when he crushed the grand slam Monday night, he did not need a committee to shove him up the dugout steps to take the curtain call, the other side of the Age of Hype.</p>
        <p>We don't know what Bonilla really thinks about all this. We only know what he says. And how he acts. Up to now, his public posture has been of a New York athlete working hard, smiling and waving. Coming off his performance Monday night, perhaps we should all listen to the New York Echo, for a day or two.</p>
