        <p>When OPEC ministers meet in Osaka on Thursday, the world will be reminded not just of the cartel's power on the global stage, but also the group's sway over its Japanese hosts.</p>
        <p>Despite spending decades developing other sources of energy, Japan, which must import almost all its oil, is more dependent on Middle East crude than it was in 1973, when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries organized its first worldwide embargo. As this oil shock rippled through Japan's economy, the globe's second largest, prices spiraled upward and panicked consumers hoarded everyday goods like detergent, sugar and toilet paper.</p>
        <p>Memories of that event, considered ancient history to most Japanese, are returning to the forefront as talk of a new Middle East war grows. Japan's economy, stuck in a decade-long funk, relies heavily on exports of autos, steel and other goods for growth. With OPEC production quotas at 11-year lows, a disruption of the oil flow from the Middle East could idle Japanese factories and throw Japan back into recession.</p>
        <p>Middle East oil is so crucial to the economy that it heavily colors Japan's role overseas. Reluctant to alienate oil-producing countries, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has, nonetheless, hedged his support for President Bush's campaign to attack Iraq. In the end, though, Japan may offer only moral support, analysts say.</p>
        <p>Japan remains confident that it can secure enough oil to offset any temporary loss of Middle East crude. The country has a formidable stockpile of fuel, enough to last 171 days. Lawmakers also assume some producers would increase output to make up for losses elsewhere, something the Saudis did during the Persian Gulf war. The spot market is another, more expensive option.</p>
        <p>Many critics, though, say that counting on such resources offers a false sense of security. Former Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata remembers how oil embargoes in the 1970's brought the global economy to its knees. Recalling the panicked buying in Japan and the long lines at American gas stations, he said policy makers and oil companies had done a poor job finding alternatives to Middle East oil.</p>
        <p>''For a country which consumes so much electricity, it's unusual and very dangerous to rely so highly on Mideast oil,'' Mr. Hata said in an interview. The events of 20 years ago so shook Mr. Hata that during the summer he wears business suits with half sleeves as a way to urge citizens to turn off their air-conditioners.</p>
        <p>To be sure, Japan has done more than most nations to diversify its energy strategy over the last three decades. It has developed nuclear power plants and increased imports of natural gas. Prodded by lawmakers, corporate Japan has not only reduced its use of energy, but also developed highly efficient cars, electronics and machinery.</p>
        <p>Japan now relies on oil for 52 percent of its energy needs, down from 73 percent in the mid-1970's. As important, given current events, Japan gets only about 1 percent of its oil from Iraq.</p>
        <p>Still, Japan remains dangerously tethered to events in the Middle East. It now imports more than 87 percent of its oil from the region, the highest since 1969. The main culprit is the growing competition for crude from China, Indonesia and Malaysia, which have cut exports and increased imports to fuel their own economies. By 2020, oil is likely to meet a greater share of China's energy needs than Japan's, according to estimates by the Institute of Energy Economics, Japan.</p>
        <p>Unlike Japan, which is facing trouble finding local alternatives, the United States can step up imports from Mexico, Canada and other neighbors if the Middle Eastern oil spigot is turned off. European countries can tap the North Sea, Russia and Africa.</p>
        <p>As choices for procuring oil narrowed in the last 15 years, Japanese refiners have revamped their operations to accommodate Middle Eastern oil. Compounding matters, Japan's domestic oil market was deregulated in 1996, forcing refiners long cloistered from international competition to slash capacity. With margins squeezed, most have been reluctant to invest in the equipment needed to process other types of oil from Russia, Mexico and beyond.</p>
        <p>The government's efforts to help companies find new oil have largely failed, a point driven home two years ago when Japan's Arabian Oil Company lost its concession to fields on the Saudi-Kuwait border. And Japan still lacks oil companies with the needed capital and technology to unearth plentiful amounts of oil. For decades, the government-backed Japan National Oil Company has provided low-cost financing to help the refiners. Yet the public corporation has come under fire for racking up huge debts and encouraging companies to invest in projects they may have otherwise avoided.</p>
        <p>''Japanese oil companies are very risk-averse,'' said Keiichi Yokobori, executive director of the Institute of Research and Innovation in Tokyo. ''Perhaps there was a moral hazard because the refiners felt they could contain risks with the government on board.''</p>
        <p>Just 15 percent of the oil Japan imports is from fields its companies have a stake in. The government has abandoned efforts to raise that target to 30 percent.</p>
        <p>Losing the Arabian Oil concession has prompted Japan to try to win access to oil fields in Libya, Iran and several Latin American countries. But here, too, Japanese companies must bid against global giants like Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch/Shell, integrated refiners with deeper roots in the region and the economies of scale to extract oil profitably.</p>
        <p>To keep factories humming and maintain its living standards, Japan has focused instead on shaping domestic consumption habits and diversifying energy sources. Most prominently, it has promoted nuclear power, which over the last two decades has tripled to 12 percent of the country's energy mix.</p>
        <p>But the program has been hit by several accidents, including one in 1999 north of Tokyo in which two workers died. More bad will was created this month when the country's largest utility, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, admitted to falsifying safety records at its nuclear plants for more than 15 years. The revelation was particularly worrisome because government regulators knew about the problem two years ago but did little to expose it.</p>
        <p>Still, the growth of nuclear power is likely to slow, not grow. With the economy projected to expand at an anemic 1.5 percent a year over the next decade, demand for electricity is likely to rise accordingly. The high cost of building and maintaining nuclear plants is another reason Japan expects to add only a dozen new nuclear plants by 2010, down from as many as 20 that were planned.</p>
        <p>Japan has also expanded its use of natural gas, which now meets 13 percent of its energy needs, about half the levels in the United States and Europe. Here, geography plays a role. Since Japan has little natural gas of its own, it must purchase it from Indonesia and elsewhere. And to be shipped, the gas must be turned into liquid, driving up its cost.</p>
        <p>To circumvent this, Japanese trading and oil companies have formed a consortium to build an ambitious pipeline from Sakhalin in eastern Russia to Japan, more than 900 miles across the North Pacific. The Japan Petroleum Exploration Company, which leads the venture, released a report last month that said the plan was economically and technologically feasible. But the pipeline would be laid across rough seas, and the companies have not clarified how they plan to compensate fishermen who ply these waters and would be forced to fish elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Construction of the pipeline -- which newspapers here estimate could cost up to $12 billion -- may start in 2005 and help Japan tap the equivalent of more than two billion barrels of oil. The consortium, though, has still not secured commitments from utilities and manufacturers to buy the natural gas, which analysts say is likely to be expensive because the pipeline's builders will want to recoup their costs.</p>
        <p>Despite these hurdles, the government has had success on the margins. By the end of the decade, utilities will be required to use fixed amounts of renewable energy, like solar and wind power, though the price of such energy remains high. Conservation laws passed in recent years require manufacturers to increase energy efficiency in computers, air-conditioners and other electronic gear by as much as 80 percent.</p>
        <p>Prodded by the government's commitment to lower greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels, Toyota and Honda have led the global auto industry in developing cars driven by hybrid engines. The Toyota Prius, which runs on gasoline and electricity, ''gets twice the fuel efficiency of a conventional car of the same class and has much cleaner emissions,'' said Paul Nolasco, a Toyota spokesman.</p>
        <p>Still, fuel-cell cars -- the ultimate goal -- remain too expensive to produce. Industry experts and automobile executives say the combustion engine is here for at least a few more decades. In the meantime, the amount of oil Japan consumes for home heating and transportation continues to rise, more than offsetting the energy-saving steps taken by Japanese industry. And since consumers generally react more slowly to swings in global prices, a crisis in the Middle East may turn into a rude awakening if the government is forced to limit the use of oil in any way.</p>
