        <p>Clinton Hill Condo  $719,000</p>
        <p>BROOKLYN: 320 Washington Avenue (near DeKalb Avenue)</p>
        <p>Three-bedroom, two-bathroom, 1,229-square-foot condo in a landmarked Greek Revival building that used to be the Graham Home for Old Ladies. Cindy McField, the Corcoran Group. (718)210-4008; www.corcoran.com</p>
        <p>MAINTENANCE: $413</p>
        <p>PROS: An extremely well-maintained building of 30 units on a lovely block. Custom closets, marble baths and high ceilings.</p>
        <p>CONS: Although there is common outdoor space at ground level, there is no deck or terrace, and the living/dining area, while airy and bright, is small for entertaining.</p>
        <p>Studio With Garden  $369,000</p>
        <p>MIDTOWN EAST: 332 East 54th Street (near Second Avenue), #1A</p>
        <p>A studio co-op with pull-down bed and a large back garden. Jon-David Lenard and Robin Liftman, Douglas Elliman Real Estate (212)891-7240; www.elliman.com</p>
        <p>MAINTENANCE: $823</p>
        <p>PROS: Renovated with natural quartzite floors, a high-beamed ceiling and exposed brick, this small studio is good for someone looking for a pied-à-terre or a comfortable and quiet apartment. The kitchen has been redone with a small Sub-Zero refrigerator, a drawer-style dishwasher and a wine storage unit. There is also a washer and dryer.</p>
        <p>CONS: The apartment has a pull-down bed that has a large cabinet and does not leave room for a sofa. The garden that is part of this property is very enticing, and because it is nearly as big as the apartment it seems an ideal prospect for expanding the living space. But the co-op will not allow it because it would compromise a basement exit.</p>
        <p>Solar-Heated Contemporary in Southport  $989,000</p>
        <p>CONNECTICUT: 591 Hulls Farm Road, Southport</p>
        <p>A barn-style contemporary on 3.95 acres with pool. The main house has two bedrooms and two-and-a-half baths; an attached apartment over the garage includes two more bedrooms. Roxanne Martin, Nicholas H. Fingelly Real Estate (203)255-9900; www.fingelly.com</p>
        <p>TAXES: $17,232</p>
        <p>PROS: The passive solar system in this house lowers winter heating bills. Glass panels on the back wall create a greenhouse effect in the two-story sun space; a series of sliding doors control hot air circulation. The list price is a good value for horsy Hulls Farm Road, which is known for its multimillion-dollar estates.</p>
        <p>CONS: The 23-year-old interior could use remodeling, particularly the kitchen and baths.</p>
        <p>Condo in Montclair  $250,000</p>
        <p>NEW JERSEY: 530 Valley Road, Montclair</p>
        <p>A one-bedroom, one-bath condominium on the ground floor of a 40-year-old high-rise building, the Bellaire House, on the edge of the Upper Montclair shopping village. It has a new galley kitchen, a pantry, an upgraded bath, and hardwood floors in living and dining area. The building has an exercise room and an outdoor pool. Edward Greenleaf, Weichert Realtors (973)746-1515; www.weichert.com</p>
        <p>TAXES AND FEES: $4,880 annual taxes, $412 monthly fees</p>
        <p>PROS: This very convenient apartment is a couple of blocks from a train station, steps from a commuter bus stop, between a supermarket and a Chinese restaurant and around the corner from a park. Two garage spaces come with the apartment, but it is possible to live without a car here. The building is quiet, secure and reasonably well maintained.</p>
        <p>CONS: The apartment has nice light and faces lovely plantings, but it has no patio, and the privacy conscious would have to forfeit the window view by keeping the blinds closed much of the time.</p>
        <p>Two-Bedroom Co-op in Harlem  $295,000</p>
        <p>HARLEM: 454 West 152nd Street (near Convent Avenue), #51</p>
        <p>MAINTENANCE: $500</p>
        <p>An apartment with two bedrooms and one bath. Open house Sunday from 1 to 3 p.m. Glenn A. Rice, independent broker (646)305-4045; www.glennarice.com</p>
        <p>PROS: The apartment has a renovated kitchen, a large dining room and a living room that looks out to 152nd Street. One bedroom is double sized because two smaller bedrooms were combined, creating room for a desk. There is a washer and dryer in the smaller bedroom, currently used as a storage and laundry room. This building is an H.D.F.C. co-op, and there is an income restriction of $72,500 per household. The express A and D trains stop at 145th Street, with an entrance at 148th Street, only a few blocks away.</p>
        <p>CONS: The apartment is on the fifth floor of a five-story walk-up building.</p>
