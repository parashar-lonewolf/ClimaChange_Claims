        <p>Since the start of the year, American producers of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's, and other chemicals that deplete the atmosphere's ozone have been paying an excise tax expected to raise $4.3 billion over the next five years. Accounting firms have been warning business clients that the tax, termed a user fee by the Bush Administration, could be the first of a host of new environmentally related levies. Environmental tax credits and incentives are also being proposed, like tax breaks for waste incineration systems. What are the prospects for these proposals? How will they affect businesses and American competitivness? Nicholas Ashford, an associate professor of technology and policy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Paul Huard, vice president in charge of tax policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, and Bill Walsh of Greenpeace Action, a Washington-based environmental group, recently met to discuss these issues. Barnaby J. Feder of The New York Times moderated.</p>
        <p>Question: Why use taxation in addition to regulation to address environmental problems?</p>
        <p>Nicholas Ashford: I can see three reasons: to raise revenue, change incentives or out of moral concerns. You might want to make polluters pay without regard to how much revenue you raise.</p>
        <p>Paul Huard: We must look at tax policy, including incentives, rather than just taxes. Our members tend to break down the universe into carrots and sticks. By and large, we prefer the carrots, largely for economic reasons. Though the sticks may achieve the same results, in many cases, they don't work very well in the context of the global economy. You may make manufacturers less competitive; that reduces employment, G.N.P., and ultimately the revenue you pick up from the environmental taxes.</p>
        <p>Bill Walsh: Also, taxes are a good way to get at small businesses, which are often among the worst polluters but outside the scope of regulation.</p>
        <p>Q. What is likely to emerge from Congress this year?</p>
        <p>Mr. Huard: The best result would be no bill at all. But I would not be surprised to see some environmental penalty taxes because they are convenient sources of quick revenue.</p>
        <p>There are so many floating around, like taxes on harvesting virgin redwoods. I wouldn't rule out taxes on sulfur and nitrogen oxides, even though there are going to be emissions limits in the Clean Air Bill.</p>
        <p>Q. Are you saying that environmental taxes are simply an ''in'' method on Capitol Hill for raising revenue?</p>
        <p>Mr. Huard: Most of them are for the revenue. I don't think many would pass otherwise because of the demonstrable impact in lost jobs or the G.N.P. But yes, the Federal budget process has made quick, short-term sources of revenue the be-all and end-all of getting out and going home.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walsh: I agree that some taxes are likely because they are quick hits. Some kind of tax on acid rain is most likely. I don't know what else will move out of the starting gate, but there are an awful lot of horses lined up. What's not going to happen is what needs to happen: - a fundamental thinking about the environmental impact of the tax laws.</p>
        <p>Q. Are you saying that policy questions are getting ignored in the rush for revenue?</p>
        <p>Mr. Ashford: We will disagree on specifics, but there are win-win situations we cannot fashion because of the quick-fix mentality of the Congress.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walsh: You could reap huge revenues from emission or input taxes, or by cutting depletion allowances. But that doesn't make sense when other aspects of the tax code are pushing industry in the wrong direction, away from an environmental perspective - and an economic one.</p>
        <p>Q. Can't these taxes be seen simply as a way to force markets to take into account the true costs of pollution?</p>
        <p>Mr. Ashford: But it's not just a matter of internalizing social costs. The current tax structure distorts the investment picture. For example, you get accelerated depreciation for pollution-control equipment. But if, God forbid, an industrialist says I want to change my process to improve productivity and, by the way, it will cut my sulfur dioxide emissions to zero, he won't get favored tax treatment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Huard: Yes, it's crazy. You get better results if you look for the win-win situation: better productivity and better products at lower cost, and a cleaner environment. But you can only do that with well thought out, very targeted incentives.</p>
        <p>Q. Are there other environmental problems in the tax code beyond sending the wrong investment cues?</p>
        <p>Mr. Ashford: Through standard deductions we subsidize improper behavior. People can deduct what they pay to transport hazardous waste to an illegal dump. Punitive damages when people lose environmental liability suits are deductible.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walsh: That's not all. If you are engaged in illegal dumping, whether through pipes or trucks, you can still deduct all your expenses, even if a court has found your activity illegal.</p>
        <p>Q. Is concern about global competitiveness holding back environmental tax reform, or is that a straw man?</p>
        <p>Mr. Ashford: A straw man. There's a world trend toward these policies and any differences will be short-lived.</p>
        <p>Mr. Huard: I'm not so sanguine. A company won't pick up a plant and move it to Belgium, but if you unilaterally impose penalties on multinationals, they will stop or reduce production here and increase it in a country that doesn't beat them over the head.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walsh: International trade concerns don't need to be a barrier. This could be an opportunity for the big multinationals - the DuPonts of the world - to support similar policies in various countries and build a business constituency for rational change. But, at least from what I have seen with CFC's, the multinationals tend to play countries against each other.</p>
        <p>Q. So environmental tax policy can be a way of improving competitiveness?</p>
        <p>Mr. Ashford: It's a world market we could exploit, one that the Japanese and Europeans are not exploiting. We are at the cutting edge in these new, environmentally safe technologies. I think the real tension is within the industrial sector, not between industrialists and environmentalists. How do you shift from old technologies to new and safer one and make it palatable politically?</p>
        <p>Q. Are any other countries taking a better approach?</p>
        <p>Mr. Huard: Several have special accelerated provisions for pollution abatement facilities. But I don't know of any that has a well thought out policy of incentives for conversion to desirable processes.</p>
        <p>Q. Are there problems squaring environmental taxes or incentives with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade or our other international trade treaties?</p>
        <p>Mr. Huard: Most arise on the tax side, like proposals taxing the use of virgin materials. Opponents say that puts American producers at a disadvantage; so the proponents say, fine, we'll put an equivalent tariff on imports. That's a problem under G.A.T.T.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walsh: You can avoid some problems by how you interpret G.A.T.T. I believe it has provisions for protection of natural resources. We also need an environmental perspective in the current G.A.T.T. negotiations.</p>
        <p>Q. Should revenues from environmental taxes be dedicated to solving environmental problems?</p>
        <p>Mr. Ashford: I think we have to earmark some of them to help industry develop cleaner technology.</p>
        <p>Mr. Huard: The problem with dedicated trust funds is that the money gets collected and spent even when the need has dissipated or, even worse, it's allowed to pile up to make the deficit look smaller. There's a lot to be said for collecting general revenues and letting various social demands compete. Make Congress set priorities; that's what it's elected for.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walsh: Clearly, reducing the deficit also benefits everybody. But there's a need to turn back some funds into environmental R. &amp; D.</p>
        <p>Q. What about dedicated taxes to compensate people injured by pollution?</p>
        <p>Mr. Ashford: Tax policy ought to be used to make polluting industries pay up front for the damage they do. We are not doing that. Just look at the social costs of the Johns Manville bankruptcy and the people going uncompensated for asbestos injuries.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walsh: The incredible example is the Lead Institute's rejection of any kind of tax to establish a fund to remove lead paint from inner-city buildings even though a study by the Environmental Defense Fund demonstrated that we have three million children suffering from lead poisoning. It's an immoral cost imposed on the neediest in society.</p>
        <p>Mr. Huard: But a lot of these things are very hard to quantify, particularly if you are guessing up front, as would have been the case with asbestos, where it takes decades for the injuries to become apparent. We prefer to rely on general revenues to cover societal costs.</p>
        <p>Q. How important is the problem of quantifying environmental costs in setting tax policy?</p>
        <p>Mr. Walsh: We are at the point where we can no longer wait to tally up the costs. By the time everyone is convinced that global warming has bad consequences and we have the data to back that up, it will be too late.</p>
        <p>Mr. Huard: I think we will have more areas of agreement if we stick to clean vs. dirty, as opposed to warm vs. warmer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ashford: It's a question of which mistake you want to avoid. On global warming, you can start now and have a relatively painless transition. If you wait until all the evidence comes in, it will be painful. There's no reason not to start demanding much more energy efficiency now.</p>
        <p>Q. Is anyone in the business community trying to put forth a sound environmental tax policy? Or is business in a strictly reactive stance?</p>
        <p>Mr. Huard: For the short term anyway; we spend all of our times putting out fires and it's hard to change that. Our membership may be too broad for something like that.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walsh: Trade groups shouldn't have to do this. It's the job of the Ways and Means Committee and the President. Someone has to sort through the competing interests, shine a light toward the goal and carve out a path. Then you can bring the diverse interests to the table for debates about time and specifics.</p>
        <p>Q. Should environmental taxes be put on hold until a sound policy is worked out?</p>
        <p>Mr. Walsh: No, we shouldn't wait for Congress to do the right thing. Taxes on things like acid rain or the cutting of virgin timber at least express an interest and there would be some benefits.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ashford: We are not even paying for the occupational environmental diseases we are causing, so you if you tax polluting industries, you can't be doing the wrong thing - even though you have to do much more than that.</p>
        <p>Mr. Huard: When you talk about acid rain, smog or failure to meet ozone standards, there are definite problems that need to be dealt with. But other problems are more long range. Taxes on virgin timber or other materials to encourage recycling, for example, are particularly wrongheaded. If you look at the major industries involved, such as paper or plastic producers, the people using the virgin materials are also the leading recyclers.</p>
