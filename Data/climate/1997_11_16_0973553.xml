        <p>THE executives from four competing companies found their seats in a room at the Palace Hotel in Tokyo and plotted the details of the crime.</p>
        <p>For the next four hours, in the matter-of-fact give-and-take of a routine business discussion, they divided up the world into four regions and mapped out their long-debated plan to fix international prices of a feed additive known as lysine.</p>
        <p>For the scheme to work, the men agreed, they needed to enforce their secret agreement to limit annual production of the nutrient. That would keep prices high, because their companies -- the Ajinomoto Company and the Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Company of Japan, the Sewon Company of South Korea, and the Archer Daniels Midland Company of the United States -- manufactured most of the world's lysine.</p>
        <p>Terrance S. Wilson, an executive with Archer Daniels, suggested that each company call in its monthly sales figures to Ajinomoto, which would then tabulate the figures and report back.</p>
        <p>But the task required discretion. ''We have to watch our telephones,'' Mr. Wilson told the assembled executives. ''We have to watch that. It can be done, but we must be very careful.''</p>
        <p>It was too late for caution. Unknown to the others, one participant, Mark E. Whitacre of Archer Daniels, was working as an informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. And a tape recorder he was carrying captured every word of the Dec. 8, 1993, meeting.</p>
        <p>It has been more than two years since the price-fixing conspiracy exploded into public view. Since then, prosecutors have obtained guilty pleas from eight corporations and six individuals. Archer Daniels, the politically powerful grain giant, agreed to a record antitrust penalty -- a $100 million fine for fixing prices of both lysine and citric acid, a food additive. Mr. Wilson, whose lawyer declined comment, is one of four executives indicted and has pleaded not guilty.</p>
        <p>But the case has also taken several bizarre turns, most of them revolving around Mr. Whitacre. In the strangest episode, he and several of his Archer-Daniels associates illegally obtained millions of dollars, laundering the money through a series of foreign bank accounts. Mr. Whitacre, who pleaded guilty to dozens of charges last month, took most of the money even as he was working with the F.B.I.</p>
        <p>Still, some tantalizing questions about the case remain unanswered. How did the investigation begin? How widespread was the knowledge of wrongdoing? How could such a broad conspiracy stay secret for several years?</p>
        <p>Some answers are finally emerging. Documents from court, corporate and Government files -- many of which are not publicly available -- provide an unprecedented look inside the largest price-fixing cartel ever brought down by law enforcement. But they also portray an inquiry saddled with troubles from the start, one that began almost by accident.</p>
        <p>These details will soon be center stage again as the first case from the investigation goes to trial. Mr. Wilson and Michael D. Andreas, the former vice chairman and once the heir apparent at Archer Daniels, face charges of participating in the scheme. Joining them in the docket will be Mr. Whitacre, whose immunity on price fixing was waived after  his financial crimes were revealed.</p>
        <p>Among the records' revelations are these:</p>
        <p>* Discussions at Archer Daniels about the lysine meetings involved more executives than the Government charges suggest, with some tapes indicating that even the company's president, James R. Randall, now retired, was told of them. Mr. Randall was not charged with wrongdoing, and his lawyer said the executive had no knowledge that anything improper occurred at the meetings.</p>
        <p>* Archer Daniels helped form trade associations to create a cover for its secret price-fixing meetings with competitors. The conspirators also used outside auditors to monitor portions of the scheme.</p>
        <p>* The F.B.I. originally came to Archer Daniels because of a lie told by Mr. Whitacre about an imaginary extortion plot against the company. Mr. Whitacre failed two polygraph tests asking about the supposed plot. And Mr. Whitacre was such a volatile witness early in the investigation that he actually informed one of the other companies in the price fixing that the F.B.I. had asked him to record conversations.</p>
        <p>One of the most striking aspects of the whole sorry story was the matter-of-fact nature of its day-to-day planning. Here was the stuff of high drama, worthy of a Tom Clancy thriller: executives of multinational corporations holding secret meetings around the world, carving up a global market for their gain at the expense of customers.</p>
        <p>Yet the executives haggled over their illegal production quotas as if they were negotiating a run-of-the-mill joint venture. When puzzling over what steps to take to carry out their plan, they pondered the nuts-and-bolts mechanics of other price-fixing conspiracies. Once the plan was in place, the tone of their conversations turned simply businesslike.</p>
        <p>In the end, it took Mr. Whitacre, a man later found to suffer from manic depression, to expose the scheme. And that raises a disturbing, all but unanswerable, question: Was the conspiracy an isolated incident in the  corporate world? Or was the only unusual part of this conspiracy that it was found out?</p>
        <p>In Search of a Saboteur</p>
        <p>Dwayne O. Andreas, Archer Daniels's chairman, could scarcely believe what he was hearing. Someone was sabotaging his company and trying to extort money from it. That, at least, was what Mr. Whitacre said.</p>
        <p>It was the summer of 1992, and the lysine business run by Mr. Whitacre at Archer Daniels was struggling. Inexplicably, efforts to feed huge vats of dextrose to microbes, the crucial step in lysine production, had shown poor results for months.</p>
        <p>Sabotage would certainly explain the foul-up. Mr. Whitacre said that a Mr. Fujiwara of Ajinomoto had called him to say that the Japanese company had placed a mole inside Archer Daniels who was contaminating the dextrose vats.</p>
        <p>According to Government investigative notes, Mr. Whitacre reported that Mr. Fujiwara wanted several million dollars wired to his Swiss bank account in exchange for identifying the mole and for providing Archer Daniels with the proprietary microbes used by Ajinomoto.</p>
        <p>But there was a problem with the shocking tale: It was a complete fabrication. Mr. Whitacre had never taken the call, and had never received any such extortion demands.</p>
        <p>But Dwayne Andreas believed the story. In August 1992, Mr. Andreas  reached out to an associate who got in touch with the Central Intelligence Agency in London, which decided the case was a matter for the F.B.I.</p>
        <p>The investigation fell to Brian Shepard, an F.B.I. agent in Archer Daniels's hometown of Decatur, Ill., who began his inquiry in November.</p>
        <p>Records show that Mr. Whitacre repeated the sabotage allegations to Mr. Shepard. Wiretaps were placed on Mr. Whitacre's home telephone to catch the purported extortionist.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Whitacre soon dropped another bombshell on Mr. Shepard: Archer Daniels, he contended, was fixing prices.</p>
        <p>To prove his allegation, on Nov. 9, Mr. Whitacre made his first recording using Government equipment, taping telephone conversations with competitors that confirmed the conspiracy's existence.</p>
        <p>Yet as the drama mounted, Mr. Whitacre was growing agitated. At about 9:10 on the night of Nov. 16, he called Mr. Shepard at his home, according to investigative notes. He complained that the F.B.I. was destroying him and was trying to hurt Michael Andreas and ''other innocent people.'' He added that he wanted nothing more to do with the F.B.I.</p>
        <p>Two days later, according to the notes, Mr. Whitacre called Mr. Shepard from a motel in Phoenix. He said that his superiors were turning against him and that he was severely depressed and considering suicide.</p>
        <p>He complained that he ''could not figure a way to win in this situation.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Whitacre was so uncertain about cooperating that he tipped off Ajinomoto that he had been approached by law-enforcement officials. In December, he told Kanji Mimoto, an Ajinomoto executive,  that the Government wanted to record his calls to investigate possible price fixing in the carbon dioxide market. He told Mr. Mimoto not to phone him at home anymore.</p>
        <p>By Dec. 17, Mr. Whitacre was expressing concerns that he might be prosecuted, and he told the F.B.I. that he wanted to strike a deal.</p>
        <p>But before one could be reached, Mr. Shepard pressed for more details about the sabotage story. Finally, Mr. Whitacre submitted to a lie detector test -- and failed. On Dec. 22, he confessed that he had made up the story, saying he had lied to cover up an effort by Archer Daniels to bribe Ajinomoto officials for their company's technology. But, again, the lie detector indicated that Mr. Whitacre was being deceptive.</p>
        <p>Today, lawyers for Mr. Wilson and Michael Andreas argue that the Government must have realized at the time that Mr. Whitacre's lie was part of an effort to illegally take millions from Archer Daniels. In essence, they are contending that the informant in the case was so out of control that all of the evidence is tainted.</p>
        <p>Indeed, months before the F.B.I. began its inquiry, Mr. Whitacre and some associates had opened bank accounts in Switzerland and the Cayman Islands. Using a system involving false invoices and dummy corporations, Mr. Whitacre had arranged to take $2.5 million from the company -- an amount that would grow to more than $9 million before his informant days were over.</p>
        <p>In addition, according to notes of F.B.I. interviews with Mr. Whitacre, he had also begun obtaining kickbacks from vendors, once involving an envelope stuffed with $100 bills. Mr. Whitacre would later say the  frauds were authorized by his bosses, but prosecutors concluded that was not true.</p>
        <p>Mr. Whitacre did not return a telephone call, and Bill Walker, a lawyer for him, declined to comment.</p>
        <p>Government lawyers dispute that the sabotage story should have tipped them off to broader problems with Mr. Whitacre.</p>
        <p>''No one would have guessed that he was trying to steal'' the money, Scott Lassar, the prosecutor in charge of the case, said at a recent hearing. ''This is one of the top executives at A.D.M.''</p>
        <p>Still, the deceptions left Mr. Shepard uneasy, and he sought out advice on dealing with Mr. Whitacre. He contacted the F.B.I.'s behavioral science unit, the profiling group that has been featured in movies like ''The Silence of the Lambs.''</p>
        <p>What advice he received is not clear. But Mr. Whitacre's cooperation agreement was written on Dec. 29, 1992, and signed 11 days later. In his own addendum, Mr. Whitacre agreed to take a polygraph at any time. The anxieties he had about cooperating seemed to disappear.</p>
        <p>At home one day near year-end, Mr. Whitacre called his recently hired gardener, Rusty Williams, over to his car. He pulled out his briefcase and placed it on the trunk. Opening it, he showed Mr. Williams the secret compartment in the Government-supplied case, and the microcassette recorder hidden inside.</p>
        <p>Speaking excitedly, Mr. Whitacre referred to himself as ''014.'' He chose the name, he told his gardener, because he was twice as smart as 007.</p>
        <p>Three months later, on the morning of March 17, Mr. Whitacre sat in his car in the company parking lot and turned on the recorder hidden in his briefcase. He expected to meet immediately with other top company executives, and wanted the tapes rolling before he walked in.</p>
        <p>Mr. Whitacre had good reason to tape this meeting. He was going to tell his bosses that Ajinomoto was accusing Archer Daniels of backing out on commitments to limit production if lysine prices fell.</p>
        <p>Within minutes of Mr. Whitacre's arrival in the office, Mr. Wilson walked in and asked for an update. As Mr. Whitacre began briefing him, Mr. Randall joined the conversation.</p>
        <p>According to a transcript, Mr. Whitacre said he had received a voice-mail message from an executive at Ajinomoto and had gone to a pay phone to return the call.</p>
        <p>''Your, your, uh, tap's off your phone you know,'' Mr. Randall replied, alluding to the wiretap that had been placed on Mr. Whitacre's home phone months before, in the extortion inquiry. ''The F.B.I. is out of it, and they took the tap off the phone.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Whitacre said, ''I still think the pay phone is the way anyway.''</p>
        <p>For the next few minutes, Mr. Whitacre described how the Ajinomoto executive had expressed anger that Archer Daniels had not limited its monthly production to nine million pounds a month, as the Japanese executives believed the company had promised to do if prices stayed low. Mr. Whitacre said Archer Daniels had only agreed to speak with its managers if prices did not go up.</p>
        <p>''What did he threaten to do?'' Mr. Randall asked.</p>
        <p>''He said there'd never be peace,'' Mr. Whitacre replied, ''and the price would stay where it is.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Randall, who retired earlier this year, was not charged in the price-fixing scheme. But experts said that such a conversation should have raised alarms.</p>
        <p>''A senior executive should find troubling any discussion about future conduct or pricing of a competitor,'' said Kevin Arquit, a former official with the Federal Trade Commission who now works with  Rogers &amp; Wells. ''Even the most basic kind of compliance program would cover such a conversation.''</p>
        <p>But Jeffrey Cole, a lawyer for Mr. Randall, said there was nothing in the conversation that should have concerned his client. In the tape, ''there is no indication at all that anybody is giving up A.D.M. price information or volume information,'' he said. ''These people are assuring him that they haven't made a deal with the Japanese.''</p>
        <p>Reaching Peace, on Camera</p>
        <p>Early on, Mr. Wilson bluntly dismissed the Japanese complaints. But later, the documents show, Archer Daniels strove for a better relationship with Ajinomoto, its largest competitor.</p>
        <p>According to Government records, peace was reached between Archer Daniels and Ajinomoto on Oct. 25, 1993. On that day, Mr. Whitacre and Michael Andreas met with two executives from Ajinomoto at the Marriott Hotel in Irvine, Calif. Government cameras hidden in the room's table lamps recorded the meeting.</p>
        <p>The meeting was crucial to the Government's case against Mr. Andreas. The investigation often went months without the Archer Daniels vice chairman being taped, and at least once he made statements on tape about how the company had to watch the laws carefully. John Bray, Mr. Andreas's lawyer, did not return phone calls.</p>
        <p>But over the course of this meeting, according to Government records, Mr. Andreas and the Japanese executives agreed to use 1993 sales volumes to calculate lysine production for the following years. Such a constraint would tend to put upward pressure on prices.</p>
        <p>Mr. Andreas suggested that the industry's growth rate be limited to 6 percent, or 14,000 tons of lysine. The executives haggled over how much to allocate each of their companies.</p>
        <p>''What would we be willing to accept out of that 14,000 tons and what would you be willing to accept, isn't that the question?'' Mr. Andreas asked his competitors.</p>
        <p>The meeting ended in agreement. At Mr. Andreas's request, the Ajinomoto executives said they would get the other lysine producers to accept the allocation plan.</p>
        <p>After more than a year of effort, the scheme was taking off.</p>
        <p>How Distrust Dissolved</p>
        <p>In the months after the Irvine meeting, the conspirators worked to iron out their deal's details. Often, that proved simple: Archer Daniels had already told the lysine producers about strategies it used to fix prices for citric acid and suggested that the lysine producers do the same.</p>
        <p>At an earlier meeting in Japan, Mr. Wilson had said that his company relied on a trade association to help with the citric acid plan. Every month, he said, Archer Daniels reported its sales to the association. And every year, he said, Swiss accountants audited the numbers at the company's offices in London and Decatur.</p>
        <p>After Irvine, Mr. Wilson pushed again for a lysine trade association. During the December 1993 meeting in Tokyo, he said an association would allow the lysine makers to get together. According to a Government affidavit that summarized the conversation, he said it would ''conceal the fact that purported competitors were secretly meeting to discuss price and sales volumes.''</p>
        <p>During that meeting, Mr. Wilson also suggested that each company report its monthly sales to Ajinomoto. The executives agreed.</p>
        <p>By March 10, 1994, the plans were well under way as the companies met at a hotel in Hawaii. One executive passed out an agenda for the lysine association, commenting that the organization was ''an easy cover-up'' for price fixing, the affidavit says.</p>
        <p>During the rest of the meeting, the executives submitted their February sales figures and debated whether to start auditing the reports. One participant expressed concern that the audit of just one company product might appear suspicious.</p>
        <p>As the men debated, it was clear that the distrust and hesitance that marked the plan's beginnings had disappeared.</p>
        <p>''You're my friend,'' Mr. Wilson told the assembled competitors. ''I want to be closer to you than I am to any customer. Because you can make it where I can make money or I can't make money.''</p>
        <p>Then Mr. Wilson encouraged the executives to just get the job done.</p>
        <p>''Let's put the prices on the board,'' he said. ''Let's all agree what we're going to do and walk out of here and do it.''</p>
        <p>For another year, the Government gathered evidence, allowing the price-fixing conspiracy to work and the crime to be completed. On June 27, 1995, Federal agents armed with search warrants descended on Archer Daniels and other companies.</p>
        <p>Within weeks, Archer Daniels disclosed that Mr. Whitacre had been taking money from the company, including several million while he was under the F.B.I.'s wing. Mr. Whitacre attempted suicide and was hospitalized. Soon, his condition was diagnosed as manic-depressive. The problems so prominent early in the case re-emerged with a vengeance.</p>
        <p>With Mr. Whitacre's credibility in shambles, the Government used his tapes to wrest guilty pleas out of participants. Then, with their cooperation, prosecutors last December indicted Mr. Andreas, Mr. Wilson, Mr. Whitacre and Kazutoshi Yamada, an  Ajinomoto executive. The Archer Daniels executives have pleaded not guilty; Mr. Yamada failed to appear.</p>
        <p>The opening day of their trial is scheduled for early next year.</p>
