        <p>HEALTH CLAIM CHECKUP The claims-processing company Athenahealth plans to present a rare warts-and-all look at how well -- or not -- the nation's seven biggest health insurers pay their bills. [Page C1.]</p>
        <p>VONAGE'S TOUGH RECEPTION In their first day of trading, shares in Vonage, the country's leading Internet phone provider, fell nearly 13 percent below the initial offering price. The sour reception suggested that investors had doubts whether the company could survive in a market where big cable providers are rushing to offer competing services. Market Place. [C1.]</p>
        <p>MARTHA STEWART CASE TO RESUME A year after her release from prison, her carefully executed makeover complete, Martha Stewart must again confront insider trading accusations. The three-year-old civil case against her is resuming. [C1.]</p>
        <p>TASERS UNDER SCRUTINY The safety of Tasers, the electric pistols widely used by police, is under new scrutiny after a study by a Wisconsin scientist showed that shocks from the guns cause the hearts of healthy pigs to stop beating. Previous studies showed that Taser shocks did not cause heart disturbances in pigs, whose hearts are similar to those of humans. [C3.]</p>
        <p>WYETH ADDS TO FEN-PHEN FUND Wyeth won final judicial approval to add $1.3 billion to a $3.75 billion settlement of lawsuits over the fen-phen diet drug combination. The extra money will help settle about 42,000 pending claims, the company said. Wyeth withdrew Pondimin and Redux, part of the fen-phen combination, in 1997 after researchers linked them to heart and lung problems in some users. [C3.]</p>
        <p>OFFICIAL'S PLANS Robert B. Zoellick, the former United States trade representative, intends to resign as deputy secretary of state after barely 15 months in the job, aides and associates said. He has told associates he would like to be Treasury secretary if John W. Snow resigns. [A14.]</p>
        <p>CBS-STERN SETTLEMENT CBS Radio has settled its breach-of-contract lawsuit with the talk-show host Howard Stern, the judge presiding over the case said, but lawyers on both sides said the agreement had not yet been signed. CBS sued Mr. Stern in February for promoting his move to Sirius Satellite Radio on his CBS morning show. [C4.]</p>
        <p>G.M. REPLACES WORKERS General Motors shares rose after the company began replacing union employees lost to buyouts and retirements with temporary workers. The company is using the temporary employees to avoid hiring at factories that are closing and to cover shortages caused by the departures. [C3.]</p>
        <p>A.C.L.U. PHONE INQUIRY The American Civil Liberties Union said it was asking utility commissions in 21 states to investigate whether the country's largest phone companies handed over their customer records to the National Security Agency without warrants. [A18.]</p>
        <p>OUR SPONSOR For the next 40 days a radio station in Boston will be, when it comes to advertising, all Snapple, all the time. Beginning tomorrow, the Snapple line of drinks sold by Cadbury Schweppes will be the sole sponsor of all programming and promotions on WFNX, a Boston FM station. Advertising, Stuart Elliott. [C4.]</p>
        <p>SUPPORT FOR NUCLEAR POWER Speaking in Pennsylvania, President Bush called for the construction of more nuclear power plants to help reduce the greenhouse gases believed to contribute to global warming. [A18.]</p>
        <p>A MATTER OF TASTE After more than 40 years, the fashion label St. John -- the choice of powerful women in business and politics -- decided it needed a face-lift. To the label's devotees, it was scandalous. [G1.]</p>
        <p>ECONOMIC SIGNS New-home sales rose last month, but failed to keep up the robust growth pace of March. The home sales numbers, along with a second government report that showed a steep decline in orders for durable goods, were seen as pointing to a softening economy. [C1.]</p>
        <p>STOCK MARKET RALLIES Stocks rallied for the first time this week after oil dropped below $70 a barrel and the government said new-home sales unexpectedly jumped in April. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 18.97 points, to 11,117.32. [C12.]</p>
        <p>MASTERCARD OFFERING MasterCard priced its long-awaited initial offering at $39 a share, slightly below expectation. Some 61.52 million shares will begin trading today. [C6.]</p>
        <p>MOBILE PHONE DEAL China Mobile Communications is poised to make one of the country's largest foreign purchases. The deal, worth about $5 billion, is for Millicom International Cellular, a Luxembourg-based mobile phone company. [C7.]</p>
        <p>ONLINE</p>
        <p>The Business of Green Businesses are going green for many reasons, not just to enhance their image. Some are seeking a competitive advantage. A special report is at nytimes.com/business.</p>
        <p>Online, Dealbook: A report on mergers and acquisitions, up-to-the-minute news on Wall Street and a look at the behind-the-scenes maneuvering is at nytimes.com/dealbook.</p>
