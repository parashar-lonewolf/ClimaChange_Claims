        <p>LEAD: The destruction of the earth's protective ozone layer, set in motion by the release of industrial gases into the atmosphere, will continue for decades despite the best efforts of governments and industries to control it, scientists now agree.</p>
        <p>The destruction of the earth's protective ozone layer, set in motion by the release of industrial gases into the atmosphere, will continue for decades despite the best efforts of governments and industries to control it, scientists now agree.</p>
        <p>Society appears to have ignited a sequence of atmospheric processes that cannot be quickly reversed. The surprisingly rapid depletion of ozone now seen by satellites - confirmed last week by a Government panel of 100 atmospheric scientists - has prompted widespread rethinking of forecasts that the changes would be gradual.</p>
        <p>Ultraviolet radiation reaching populated areas could rise as much as 5 to 20 percent early in the 21st century, according to projections from a variety of still-unreliable computer models. Those levels would cause vast increases in skin cancer, and biologists say they could devastate some crops and ocean populations.</p>
        <p>Even if emissions are halved in the next decade, as called for under an international treaty awaiting ratifications, levels of chlorine gases in the atmosphere will continue to rise. A single chlorine molecule remains in the stratosphere, breaking down tens of thousands of ozone molecules, for as long as a century. 'A Real Hole Here'</p>
        <p>''We're going to have to live with our past mistakes, and the situation will get worse,'' said Irving M. Mintzer, head of the climate program of the World Resources Institute, a research group in Washington. ''We've dug ourselves a real hole here.''</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the latest ozone measurements reflect only gases released in the 1970's and earlier; gases now rising through the lower atmosphere will take seven to 10 years to reach the stratosphere, six to 15 miles above Earth's surface. More gases in refrigerators and insulating foams will be gradually released over the decades.</p>
        <p>Government scientists estimate that levels of these gases will not stop rising until they reach 6 to 8 parts per billion, more than double their present levels. ''What we do in the next few years is very important, but the effects won't be felt until down the line,'' said Richard Stolarski of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.</p>
        <p>The 31-nation treaty negotiated last year in Montreal would first stabilize the rate of emissions of chlorofluorocarbon gases and then gradually reduce them to half of their 1986 levels. Environmental experts argue, however, that the recent ozone findings make the assumptions underlying the Montreal protocol seem too optimistic, and they see a need for much tighter controls.</p>
        <p>Government environmental officials, on the other hand, say they are unwilling to reopen the delicate treaty process and that the issue of further cuts in emissions can be taken up beginning in 1990 under a timetable in the current accord.</p>
        <p>A new study by the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group in New York, estimates that an 85 percent cut in emissions will be necessary to stabilize the levels of destructive chlorofluorocarbons and other gases. Other environmental groups are also using the 85 percent figure and asserting that, even with that sharp a reduction, the levels in the atmosphere would not stabilize for years.</p>
        <p>''Current ozone depletion is effectively irreversible,'' the fund's report states. ''CFC's in the atmosphere will continue to grow throughout the 21st century even under the protocol's 50 percent emissions cut.'' Flaws in the Models</p>
        <p>The head of NASA's official effort to predict future ozone depletion, Michael J. Prather, is preparing a report to Congress at the end of this month that will assemble calculations from an international assortment of computer models. Dr. Prather said the forecast of ozone loss over the next 30 years would range from 1 to 4 percent.</p>
        <p>The same models, however, had previously predicted half or less of the depletion that has now been observed. They do not take into account the surprising seasonal ''hole'' in ozone over Antarctica, or the unusual polar processes that seem to be so powerful in breaking down ozone molecules.</p>
        <p>''These are the best models we have, but we know they're missing things,'' Dr. Prather said. ''We are missing the Antarctic phenomenon. We know we're not getting the right ozone depletion down there.''</p>
        <p>As a rough guideline, Dr. Prather and other model users believe that emissions of chlorine gases will stay more or less constant even under the terms of the treaty. The cutbacks in the United States and other industrial nations may be offset by exemptions for poor countries and increases by countries that will not join the accord.</p>
        <p>Fifteen years have passed since scientists first predicted that chlorine gases, then used in spray cans and still used in refrigerators, insulating foams and industrial solvents, would act as powerful catalysts in the chemistry of the upper atmosphere, breaking down the trace amounts of ozone that absorb ultraviolet radiation. Higher Rates of Ozone Loss</p>
        <p>The forecasts that motivated the Montreal treaty assumed about a 1 percent loss of ozone, already enough to cause tens of thousands of extra skin cancers each year. The extra ultraviolet light, at the short wavelengths most damaging to the genetic material of cells, would mean a 3 to 6 percent increase in the rate of most skin cancers, according to estimates published by the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>The actual loss of ozone now seems much greater. The new Government panel, sponsored by NASA, reached a consensus estimate of a 1.7 percent loss in the latitudes from Florida to Pennsylvania and 3 percent from Pennsylvania north to mid-Canada.</p>
        <p>Even without human intervention, ozone waxes and wanes with a natural variability that is poorly understood. Ozone is the three-atom form of oxygen, which ordinarily forms molecules of two atoms. Near the ground, it is a noxious pollutant; in the stratosphere, its absorptive ability makes Earth's life possible.</p>
        <p>Ozone molecules are continually broken down in reactions hastened by chlorofluorocarbons and re-formed by reactions spurred by sunlight. Scientists believe that the outcome of this interaction is closely tied to the 11-year cycle of solar radiation and that the next few years are likely to bring a short-term renewal of ozone, as solar activity reaches its maximum. Then as solar activity wanes again, the scientists expect ozone to resume its decline.</p>
        <p>Data have been hard to come by. The report last week was the most authoritative attempt to reconcile incomplete, and sometimes inconsistent, readings from ground stations and satellites. The satellite data go back less than a decade, not enough to give a reliable sense of ozone's long-term behavior. 'Hole' Above Antarctica</p>
        <p>Nothing in the direst predictions of environmentalists a decade ago prepared scientists for the discovery in 1985 of a ''hole'' in the ozone over the South Pole. Depletion over the entire Antarctic continent in springtime has been as high as 50 percent, and the hole has widened each year, now reaching populated areas of South America.</p>
        <p>Urgent scientific expeditions have sought the cause, with some success. Though agreement is far from complete, atmospheric chemists believe they have worked out the complex chain of reactions that destroy ozone at such rapid rates. This chemistry, tied to extreme cold and the formation of cloud droplets, suggests that ozone can be unexpectedly sensitive to chlorine compounds.</p>
        <p>Natural causes, at first considered to be possible explanations for the hole, now seem to have been ruled out. Some scientists pointed to the influence of particles sent into the atmosphere by the El Chichon volcanic eruption in 1982, for example, but the satellite readings show no special effect from the Mexican eruption.</p>
        <p>Most scientists are now also persuaded that the seasonal ozone hole, along with a less dramatic loss of ozone at the North Pole, must be connected to the less extreme worldwide depletion. But no one knows just how. Some scientists view the holes as chemical ''factories,'' churning out ozone-depleted air that spreads through the hemispheres. Concern for Plant Life</p>
        <p>Every 1 percent loss of ozone allows roughly 2 percent more ultraviolet light to reach Earth's surface. Many scientists guess that a 1 percent depletion takes about a decade at the present rate, and the rate may accelerate.</p>
        <p>''Under the treaty, we can expect depletion to grow by at least a factor of three by sometime in the middle of the next century,'' said Michael Oppenheimer, author of the Environmental Defense Fund report. ''We're on an upward ramp that will level off at about 10 percent depletion. We're headed rapidly into the realm of dangerous ultraviolet radiation.''</p>
        <p>Among biologists specializing in the effects of light on organisms, concern is growing. The American Society of Photobiology, meeting last week in Colorado Springs, presented new research highlighting the urgency of the problem.</p>
        <p>''On a global scale, the most significant thing is the destruction of plants,'' said Thomas Coohill, the group's president-elect. ''If you start tampering with the layer of ozone that quickly, you don't have enough time to evolve protective mechanisms.''</p>
        <p>Sunlight with extra radiation at the short, ultraviolet wavelengths appears no brighter to people or most other creatures, including the tiny ocean organisms that will be among the most vulnerable. Neither sunbathers nor plankton will sense the extra danger.</p>
        <p>Some biologists believe that damage to plankton , floating near the ocean surface, could have severe consequences.</p>
        <p>''Our data say that these organisms are already under very drastic ultraviolet stress right now,'' said Donat Haber of the University of Marburg, West Germany. ''Most of them are incredibly sensitive. When you expose a population of these organisms, they will die within a few hours.''</p>
        <p>New research by Dr. Haber's group suggests that a 5 percent increase in ultraviolet light can cut the lifetime of some microorganisms in half. If this occurred on a large scale, the effects could reverberate upward through ecological systems and even influence Earth's climate.</p>
        <p>Some sensitive bacteria create nitrogen, which is indispensible for such crops as rice. Phytoplankton, such as algae, play a central role in Earth's carbon dioxide cycle, taking in vast amounts. A significant destruction of phytoplankton could raise carbon dioxide levels, speeding the warming of the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>They also provide food for larger creatures. ''When you go through the food chain, the effects multiply, and eventually we will be losing millions of tons of fish protein,'' Dr. Haber said. Effects on Immune System</p>
        <p>The effects of increased ultraviolent light on human health are also poorly understood, though the connection between ultraviolet radiation and skin cancer has been established.</p>
        <p>''What's not known - and I think it's really critical - is what are the effects for certain infectious diseases,'' said Margaret Kripke, a University of Texas immunologist who recently headed an E.P.A. panel on the consequences of ozone depletion.</p>
        <p>Ultraviolet light appears to damage the immune system, making people more vulnerable to some virus infections and parasitic diseases. It alters immune cells in the skin and causes other changes that scientists do not understand, turning off some of the immune response to foreign substances.</p>
        <p>Research into the biology and chemistry of the ozone problem is intensifying. For those concerned with public policy, however, the psychology of the issue - pervaded by scientific uncertainty - remains troublesome.</p>
        <p>Until this year, researchers had not even reached a consensus on the existing damage to the ozone layer. Governments and corporations find that their options are made all the more obscure by the long time lags between causes and effects.</p>
        <p>''It's not a Chicken Little problem -we don't all die at the end of the week,'' Dr. Mintzer said. ''We're asking people to reduce the risk of an invisible, odorless, colorless gas because we perceive that there will be a risk of destruction of an invisible shield, allowing the penetration of invisible rays.''</p>
