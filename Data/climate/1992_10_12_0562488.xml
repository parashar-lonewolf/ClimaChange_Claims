        <p>In the skies above the South Atlantic Ocean, a region far from factories and human beings, and long thought of as pristine, scientists are studying an unusual cloud of pollution that they fear will harm people and contribute to global warming.</p>
        <p>The pollution, a vast pool of ozone and smog, is particularly alarming, the scientists say, because it is the largest concentration of pollution found so far in the Southern Hemisphere, the cleaner half of the planet.</p>
        <p>The pollution is being examined in the most ambitious atmospheric study ever undertaken in the South Atlantic region. Members of the study team say they have found evidence that much of this ozone and smog is caused by fires raging across fields and grasslands of Brazil and the savannas of southern Africa, and that it is comparable to the pollution over industrial regions in Europe, Asia and the United States.</p>
        <p>But in the tropics, they warn, the intense radiation of the sun quickens the production of ozone and can make pollution more dangerous than in cooler regions.</p>
        <p>At its peak in September and October, the core of the ozone pool is believed to be just below the Equator, stretching from the west coast of Africa out over the ocean, with a diameter of more than 2,000 miles. Layers of ozone hover from the ocean's surface to an altitude as high as six miles. The pool's plumes, researchers say, trail off west as far as Brazil and to the east across southern Africa and all to the way to Australia.</p>
        <p>The pool is at its peak now, in the austral spring, when farmers and ranchers set huge fires to clear their lands. The emissions from the fires, much like exhausts from cars and chimneys, can produce ozone and smog even at great distances.</p>
        <p>The size of this pollution cloud over the South Atlantic is raising new concerns about the dangers of ozone, a form of oxygen that reacts readily with other substances and, up close, can be harmful to living things.</p>
        <p>Many scientists agree that low-level ozone has increased in the Northern Hemisphere in the last few decades, and recent studies by the Environmental Protection Agency say that ozone concentrations commonly seen over the United States may be affecting human health.</p>
        <p>Several scientists now studying the South Atlantic region argue that ozone may be more important to climate change than previously thought, a view other scientists have challenged. They have also warned that ozone is increasing even faster than carbon dioxide, which is often described as the principal agent of global warming.</p>
        <p>These scientists say it is vital to understand ozone because of its complex role as a villain and a blessing to life on earth.  People and Plants Vulnerable</p>
        <p>"We must remember that ozone is a toxic gas," said Dr. Jack Fishman, a scientist with National Aeronautics and Space Administration and one of the leaders of the group studying the South Atlantic. "At the earth's surface, when it comes into contact with living things, it can be very harmful to people's lungs. It can affect trees and stunt crops even though high up in the atmosphere, it performs the important task of giving us a shield against excess radiation of the sun."</p>
        <p>Between these levels, between the surface and the stratosphere, high ozone concentrations and the smog they form are thought to act as a greenhouse gas that traps heat from earth and that can contribute to climate change. It is this middle-level ozone in the atmosphere that is being scrutinized.</p>
        <p>"There is a trilogy of global change," said Dr. Fishman, of which the two most widely debated parts are the loss of ozone in the stratosphere -- the ozone hole -- and the worldwide rise in carbon dioxide. "But the third part of the trilogy, the danger of increasing ozone in the lower atmosphere, has been more difficult to see and has not received much attention."</p>
        <p>More than 180 scientists and technicians from 13 nations are on a six-week expedition to map ozone and related gases and particles in the region.</p>
        <p>The $8 million venture includes scientists from the United States, Germany and France who have brought powerful lasers and sensitive detectors. They are using specially outfitted laboratory planes, helicopters, towers, parachutes and balloons to study the atmosphere over the ocean and over South America and Africa.</p>
        <p>"This is very exciting," said Dr. Meinrat Andreae, who heads the German team. "It is the first time we are getting such a broad view of how the atmospheric engine is wired up and functions here."</p>
        <p>The mission, which is backed by NASA, among many institutions, has had to overcome initial skepticism from fellow scientists incredulous about the ozone mass.</p>
        <p>"It didn't make sense, this ozone bulge coming off Africa," said Dr. Fishman, who first reported the ozone four years ago, after examining satellite measurements. "The satellite analysts at first thought I was crazy. They thought we were picking up interference from clouds. But now we have already seen a part of the bulge."</p>
        <p>Gerald Gregory, a leading American ozone specialist, said he and others believe that the large ozone pool inevitably has a global effect. "But we do not yet understand it," he said.  Wheezes and Coughs</p>
        <p>In the areas where much of the South Atlantic pollution originates, the effect on people has already been noted. During the burning season, a thick pall of smog, produced by vegetation fires and aggravated by other exhaust, hangs over central Brazil and large parts of South Africa. In cities in both areas, doctors report that at this time of the year, people suffer many more respiratory problems than at other times.</p>
        <p>It will take months to interpret all the findings. But as the group of American scientists landed here with much information already recorded, some could not hide their excitement. In the rapidly growing field of atmospheric research, researchers can now take along instruments that yield almost immediate findings.</p>
        <p>Above Brazil, as huge fires raged in grass and shrublands, Dr. Fishman said, the NASA plane on a number of days flew through the equivalent of "a smoke-filled room, but then on an enormous regional scale."</p>
        <p>"At one point, just north of Brasilia, almost every instrument went off scale," he said. "It was unbelievable. People went wild. We were approaching a Stage 2 smog alert in Los Angeles, and that at 11,000 feet." In a Stage 2 alert, on a three-stage scale, children and the elderly are advised to stay indoors.</p>
        <p>Tropical storms over Brazil pumped the pollution quickly up to great heights, the scientists found, and high-altitude winds carried it to southern Brazil.</p>
        <p>"We saw a great outflow from south Brazil, curving toward the South Atlantic," Dr. Fishman said. "I am confident that we have registered a part of the impact on the ozone bulge coming from South America."</p>
        <p>Crossing the Atlantic, researchers detected high ozone levels between 25 degrees west and 25 degrees east, often three times as high as expected. Where Fire, There's Smoke</p>
        <p>"We found ozone and a bunch of nitrogen gases with the potential to make ozone at levels two to three times higher than you'd expect at a remote ocean site," said one of the researchers, Robert Talbot of the University of New Hampshire.</p>
        <p>As they approached Africa, they said, pollution became heavier and they picked up thick currents of smoke and particles from the seasonal fires set by farmers, ranchers and herdsmen. That day and on the ones before, satellites registered fires across much of the southern tier of Africa -- in Angola, Zambia, Zaire and South Africa.</p>
        <p>While ozone concentrations cannot be seen with the naked eye or by a camera from space, the NASA team had developed a method to extrapolate its presence from satellite data.</p>
        <p>By looking at smoke plumes and wind patterns, they assumed that fires were the main source for the Atlantic ozone. But only on this mission are scientists getting on-the-spot measurements and a sweeping view including Brazil, the South Atlantic and Africa. Adding to their sense of discovery is the knowledge that few studies have been made of the skies over the South Atlantic, most of them shipboard measurements.</p>
        <p>"There's no weather here -- there are no big storms, no hurricanes, no monsoons," Dr. Fishman said, "so meteorologists generally ignored it."</p>
        <p>The most powerful tool the scientists are using for their new map is the Lidar, a black metal, funnel-like device on the NASA plane that shoots four laser beams through the roof and four through the aircraft's floor. The lasers act like moving knives, cutting through the atmosphere from the earth to more than 40,000 feet, to the base of the stratosphere, detecting ozone and particles along the way. The instrument projects its findings onto a printer in different colors almost immediately.</p>
        <p>"We saw different layers of ozone at different altitudes," said Dr. Edward Browell of NASA, who developed the instrument. "It can do what the satellite cannot. We found ozone layers from the surface to 15,000 feet and layers between 20,000 and 30,000 feet." Dr. Browell said they had even found debris from Mount Pinatubo, the Philippine volcano that erupted last year. Then There's the Stratosphere</p>
        <p>But calculating how much ozone caused by human activity comes from South America and how much from Africa has become complicated because the mission scientists said they have already detected a third source of ozone, that coming down from the stratosphere.</p>
        <p>"This is no longer a simple case of smoke being cooked over the ocean," Dr. Fishman said. "We found stratospheric ozone that was coming down." He said it did not come close to the earth's surface, but hovered in the upper atmosphere. "This is stratospheric ozone being redistributed by the winds," he said. Once it comes down below 50,000 feet, as it has, he said, its role as a greenhouse gas becomes more important.</p>
        <p>NASA researchers said the Atlantic ozone and smog should start to dissipate by November and form again by next June. By the end of the current expedition, on Oct. 24, the team hopes to have mapped the effects of the vast fires, their impact on the people of the two continents and on the ocean between them.  Taking the Tropics Seriously</p>
        <p>Dr. Andreae noted that scientists had long studied the Northern Hemisphere, which has most of the planet's land mass, population and industry.</p>
        <p>"But when people started looking for clean air in the tropics," he said, "they got some nasty surprises. Now, many scientists have understood that the role of the tropics is very important, that the vegetation fires here are an overwhelming phenomenon. This is now being taken very seriously."</p>
