        <p>In response to new evidence that the earth's atmospheric ozone shield may be weakening over parts of the United States, President Bush today ordered directed American manufacturers to end by Dec. 31, 1995, virtually all production of chemicals that destroy ozone.</p>
        <p>The policy, authorized under a provision of the 1990 Clean Air Act, takes effect immediately. Last Friday the Bush Administration reversed its opposition to such a plan and backed a Senate proposal to phase out the production of the chemicals as soon as possible, rather than by 2000.</p>
        <p>The action today not only affects a dozen chemical companies and thousands of manufacturing workers across the country, but also puts enormous pressure on makers of automobile air conditioners, computer equipment, fire prevention systems and refrigerators and other industrial users of the chemicals to redesign their equipment.</p>
        <p>"It's a substantial step, one that we believed was warranted by the scientific evidence, but nevertheless still a big job for us," said Kevin Fay, the executive director of the Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy, a coalition of users and producers of the chemicals.</p>
        <p>The new policy was formulated by a committee of top Administration officials including William K. Reilly, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency; Michael R. Deland, the chairman of the President's Council on Environmental Quality, and Samuel K. Skinner, the White House chief of staff.</p>
        <p>"There is a scientific consensus that these chemicals are destructive to ozone in the atmosphere," Mr. Reilly said today in an interview, "and this Administration has a record of responding quickly to that threat."</p>
        <p>Mr. Deland added: "It's a substantial step forward. President Bush is unilaterally accelerating the phaseout of ozone-depleting substances. It is another step in a consistent posture of leadership by this President on this issue." Praise by Environmentalists</p>
        <p>Experts with several of the nation's prominent environmental groups praised the action, but said more aggressive steps were necessary to halt the deterioration of the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>"This is a modest step in the right direction but not all that is required to protect the ozone layer," said David Doniger, a lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington. "What we've asked the Environmental Protection Agency to do under the Clean Air Act is to phase out halons immediately. We asked that methyl chloroform be eliminated by beginning of next year. And we want CFC production to be eliminated by the end of 1994. That is what Germans have already announced, and we should at least match them."</p>
        <p>The President's order affects a family of chlorine- and bromine-based chemicals, widely used in American industry as solvents, refrigerants, fire retardants and as feedstocks for other chemicals. These chemicals are chlorofluorocarbons or CFC's, halons, methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride.</p>
        <p>The CFC's were developed in 1931 by the General Motors Corporation, were commercialized in an alliance with E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, and were considered among the most useful compounds ever invented. Entire industrial sectors were developed to take advantage of their properties, including their low cost of production, their persistence and the widely accepted scientific view that they are neither highly toxic nor carcinogenic.</p>
        <p>But in a twist that has followed other important technological developments of the 20th century, the CFC's and sister compounds turned out to have a curse. As early as 1974, chemists at the University of Michigan and the Universit of California at Irvine recognized that hundreds of millions of pounds of the compounds were escaping and accumulating in the atmosphere every year. The chemists found that sunlight broke up the CFC molecules and that the freed chlorine atoms were capable of destroying ozone in the upper atmosphere.</p>
