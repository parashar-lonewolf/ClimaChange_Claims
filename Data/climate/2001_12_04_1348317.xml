        <p>Work crews at the World Trade Center this week intend to undertake one of the most delicate and potentially hazardous assignments to date: removing an estimated 8,000 pounds of a chemical that once helped cool the air in the giant office towers.</p>
        <p>Since September, city officials have been waiting for the right moment to try to extract the chlorodifluoromethane, which is often called by its trade name, Freon, the same substance that depletes the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>But only after several months of work removing hundreds of thousands of tons of debris have the contractors been able to gain access to the underground tanks where the air-conditioning coolant is stored.</p>
        <p>Starting tonight, if all goes as planned, firefighters will escort a team of specially trained workers down six flights of stairs below what was once the north tower and into the basement area where tanks are situated. The plan is to connect a long hose to the tanks and drain the chemical to a storage truck above ground.</p>
        <p>Other tanks at the site may have already lost their Freon as a result of fire or other damage, officials say.</p>
        <p>City and federal officials say they are confident that the operation can be completed without any problem. But the chemical, if released into the atmosphere in large amounts, could pose a serious health hazard, particularly to workers at the site.</p>
        <p>''I am not really that concerned,'' said Deputy Fire Chief Ronald R. Spadafora, who is in charge of safety matters at the trade center site. ''But of course, we want to be ready, because we are responsible for the safety of everybody down there.''</p>
        <p>Chemical coolants are frequently removed from large air-conditioning units without any incident. The concern here, officials said, is that the tanks or air-conditioning machinery might have been damaged in the towers' collapse.</p>
        <p>Air monitoring by federal officials since Sept. 11 has at times detected small amounts of the substance, evidence that some tanks ruptured or were damaged. But the air sampling has no levels that were even close to being dangerous, said Neil J. Norrell, the Environmental Protection Agency's on-scene coordinator.</p>
        <p>Hudson Technologies, a Pearl River, N.Y., company that has removed chemical coolants from aircraft carriers and submarines, among many other locations, is performing most of the work, which could continue through Thursday or perhaps longer.</p>
        <p>The air-conditioning units they will be working on are enormous: each of the two is nearly the size of a tractor trailer. The workers going into the basement will have monitors that constantly check the air to ensure that the chemical is not leaking. The long hose also has valves that allow it to be closed off in different spots, in case it were to be severed.</p>
        <p>The work of hooking the hose to the tanks is set to be done at night, when there is little earth-moving equipment pounding the ground above.  The work crews will have oxygen supplies with them, and the Fire Department is preparing an evacuation plan in case there is a problem.</p>
        <p>Deputy Chief Spadafora said that the work might be put off for a few days until he and other officials are satisfied that an adequate evacuation plan is in place. But even if there were to be a release of some of the Freon, he said he did not think it would pose a threat to Battery Park City residents or others who might be outside near the site.</p>
        <p>The substance is heavier than air, so at high concentrations it displaces oxygen, making it impossible to breathe, an Environmental Protection Agency spokeswoman said. Under certain circumstances, it apparently can be converted into hydrochloric or hydrofluoric acid, which can burn a person's eyes or throat, and at extremely high concentrations is even strong enough to cut glass, the official said.</p>
