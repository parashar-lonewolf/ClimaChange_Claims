        <p>LEAD: Western Europeans observed Earth Day by staging demonstrations, climbing mountains and planting trees today, but these events served to make clear that growing public support for environmental protection has brought little change in the way the nations deal with nature.</p>
        <p>Western Europeans observed Earth Day by staging demonstrations, climbing mountains and planting trees today, but these events served to make clear that growing public support for environmental protection has brought little change in the way the nations deal with nature.</p>
        <p>Concern for the environment has seeped into everyday language, political debate and party platforms, but a crowded and prosperous Europe continues to turn farmland into highways, to poison rivers and seas and to scar coastlines with tourist developments.</p>
        <p>Some government officials nonetheless say progress is being made. In the two decades since environmental movements emerged here, all West European countries have adopted strict laws to curb the worst emissions of cars and industries, while environmental parties and organizations have seen a spectacular rise in membership and votes.</p>
        <p>Over the same period, Europeans have not been asked to abandon habits that environmentalists consider harmful or wasteful, like their ever-greater dependence on private cars and their growing taste for throw-away rather than re-usable products. The average European, though, still produces only half as much garbage as an average American.</p>
        <p>'There Are Too Many of Us'</p>
        <p>''We have done enough research and we know we must economize energy and products,'' said Jacqueline Denis, a French specialist, in an Earth Day debate, ''There are too many of us to carry on this way.''</p>
        <p>In Eastern Europe, where the environmental damage from four decades of Communist rule is often termed a catastrophe, Earth Day had the extra dimension of now being possible. Cyclists in Gdansk, Poland, and Vilnius, Lithuania, protested against smog. In East Berlin, strollers looked at exhibits related to East Germany's degraded environment, and in Czechoslovakia a ''Green relay race'' had its start amid the blackened coal fields of Bohemia.</p>
        <p>But from Poland to Romania, while demands for a cleaner environment are growing, governments lack the resources or experience to close or convert old coal-fueled factories or to dispose of garbage and toxic wastes other than by dumping them in rivers.</p>
        <p>In Western Europe, the gap between intentions and action was well illustrated in the Earth Day observances. In France, groups held hands along the Loire to honor one of Europe's ''last clean rivers.'' At the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, supporters of the Green environmental parties mourned victims of pollution.</p>
        <p>Young people in Rome lay in the streets to draw attention to traffic victims, and in smog-laden Madrid a hot-air balloon rose over the city bearing slogans focusing on atmospheric pollution, particularly the threat to the earth's ozone layer.</p>
        <p>Crowds Smaller Than Expected</p>
        <p>But crowds were uniformly smaller than organizers expected. More than demonstrating the determination of their movement, environmentalists drew attention to the problems that remain to be addressed, from global warming and deforestation to acid rain in West Germany, from garbage disposal in the North Sea to toxic emissions into the Rhine River.</p>
        <p>Unlike Eastern Europe, countries in the West are debating not whether societies can afford to protect and improve their environments but whether governments and electorates are willing to pay what many experts say would be the price: slower economic growth and higher costs of living.</p>
        <p>Over the last 30 years, for example, many Northern Europeans have claimed the right to summer vacations in the sun. As a result, the coasts of Portugal, Spain, France and Italy have become an almost uninterrupted line of hotels and apartment blocks, with green areas ever shrinking.</p>
        <p>Similarly, even though three warm winters have hurt the ski resorts of Switzerland, France, Italy and Austria, the unspoiled rural districts in all four countries continue to be eroded by construction of new ski lifts, highways and resort hotels. And today, air pollution reaches even into the Alps.</p>
        <p>Despite increasing consumer spending, the quality of life in many European cities is deteriorating. Spain, for instance, celebrated the sale of more than a million new cars there in 1988 as proof of economic success. But traffic jams have begun to paralyze Madrid.</p>
        <p>Waste Disposal Is a Problem</p>
        <p>The European Community has established maximum emission levels for vehicles in the 12-nation region, but the rules are still widely ignored. Levels of the air pollutant sulfur dioxide in Milan, Madrid, Paris, Glasgow and Frankfurt are often at levels considered hazardous to health, experts say.</p>
        <p>Less visible in many cities is the problem of waste disposal. Western European nations still bury three-quarters of their garbage, and Britain continues to dump sewage sludge into the North Sea. Experts say that 80 percent of Europe's waste could be recycled at only a marginally higher cost.</p>
        <p>Growing interest in environmental protection was apparent in a sharp increase in support for Green parties and movements in last June's elections for the European Parliament, as well as in increased exposure for environmental issues in the press and television.</p>
        <p>With the European Community moving toward the creation of a single market after 1992, the plan is for common rules throughout the region, even if the rules do no more than prevent nations that pollute more from enjoying economic advantages over the nations that try to control pollution.</p>
