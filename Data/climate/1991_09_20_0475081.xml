        <p>A little before noon yesterday the wind blew, the rain fell and the temperature dropped 10 degrees in what seemed like 10 seconds. And guess what? People not only smiled but began to think the unthinkable: Maybe New York's endless summer has come to an end.</p>
        <p>Endless is the word for it. Way back on April 9, when people still had liners in their raincoats, the thermometer hit 86 degrees, 4 degrees higher than the previous record set in 1871 and an incredible</p>
        <p>36 degrees</p>
        <p>above average. Totally weird, we thought; certainly can't happen again. But it did. On Tuesday, Sept. 17 -- football season! -- the temperature hit 93, another record.</p>

        <p>A little before noon yesterday the wind blew, the rain fell and the temperature dropped 10 degrees in what seemed like 10 seconds. And guess what? People not only smiled but began to think the unthinkable: Maybe New York's endless summer has come to an end.</p>
        <p>Endless is the word for it. Way back on April 9, when people still had liners in their raincoats, the thermometer hit 86 degrees, 4 degrees higher than the previous record set in 1871 and an incredible</p>
        <p>36 degrees</p>
        <p>above average. Totally weird, we thought; certainly can't happen again. But it did. On Tuesday, Sept. 17 -- football season! -- the temperature hit 93, another record.</p>
        <p>So that's five months of summer -- five months of unbearable ozone levels, insufferable subway platforms, extra ambulance runs, near-record water use, frayed tempers and lots else. Subsumed in those five months were 39 days when the temperature exceeded 90 degrees. Another record. And now we're told by the city's Bureau of Water Supply that reservoirs are at 55.3 percent of capacity, and that a drought watch may be declared.</p>
        <p>We feel sorry, of course, for anyone who's had to endure this: commuters and straphangers, dehydrated 39-year-old tennis players like Jimmy Connors, people without air-conditioners. Condolences, too, to clothiers like Brooks Brothers and J. Press that stocked their window displays with tweeds and winter suits the day after Labor Day, just when they should have been loading up on seersuckers.</p>
        <p>So what's cooking here, besides us? Global warming? The scientists don't know, and neither do we. What we do know is that Henry James is in for a spate of revisionism. The great man of letters once said that the two most beautiful words in the English language were "summer afternoon." He must have been in England at the time.</p>
