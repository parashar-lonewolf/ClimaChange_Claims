        <p>War in the Gulf A16-18</p>
        <p>The effect of the allied bombing on Iraq's elite Republican Guards has been significant, Senior allied officers argued, but most said that more aerial attacks on the troops' positions would be needed before a ground offensive could begin. Page A1</p>
        <p>News analysis: The decision by President Bush on whether to initiate a ground offensive will be based on an enormously complex mosaic of intelligence information, much of which is not being shared with the public or Congress. A16</p>
        <p>For Saudi fallen, martyrdom; to the families, benefits A16</p>
        <p>Iraqis sever ties with six nations A17 The Administration's postwar vision was sketched by Secretary of State Baker. He suggested it would require some continued American military role in the Persian Gulf and possibly international aid to rebuild Iraq's economy. A1</p>
        <p>Jordan supports Iraq, King Hussein announced, abandoning his professed neutrality. He said the allied war effort was "against all Arabs and all Muslims and not against Iraq alone." A17</p>
        <p>Israelis continue raids in Southern Lebanon A18</p>
        <p>News analysis: Why did Shamir support Cabinet change?  A18  International A3-15</p>
        <p>Several undercover agents believed to be working for Israel in a Syrian-based terrorist group were unmasked and executed last fall, not long after the United States provided Syria with information about terrorist concerns, Administration officials say. A1</p>
        <p>President Gorbachev sought support from the nation, asking that people "doom" the separatist republics to failure by backing him in his March 17 referendum on the necessity of preserving the Soviet Union.  A15</p>
        <p>Baltics and Ukraine to get U.S. medical aid A15</p>
        <p>Yugoslavia has returned Albanians seeking asylum to Albania's Government, which reportedly has imprisoned returned escapees for up to three years. A11</p>
        <p>Bonn to seek curbs on arms exporters A12</p>
        <p>The next step for South Africa as it moves toward a new political system may be a conference of political parties representing blacks, whites and other racial categories. A9</p>
        <p>Haiti buoyant on eve of inauguration A3</p>
        <p>Punta del Este Journal: Wealthy Latins flock to Uruguay A4</p>

        <p>Insurance companies are changing their all-things-to-all-people approach in favor of a narrower focus. The change could affect rates for many kinds of insurance, the prices of insurance stocks and the economy in the Northeast. A1</p>
        <p>In last week's fiery plane crash only one of six exits on the USAir 737 was clear after the collision, Federal investigators said. A1</p>
        <p>Children who were exposed to crack prenatally are beginning to enter the nation's schools. They are presenting a range of problems and behaviors that have left kindergarten teachers confused and exhausted.  A1</p>
        <p>U.S. almost triples estimate of hard-core cocaine users D24</p>
        <p>A plan to combat infant mortality in 10 cities would by financed by taking money from other health programs that serve pregnant women, poor children and the homeless, Administration officials said. A1</p>
        <p>The rulings on minority scholarships recently made by the Department ofEducation would be suspended and reassessed if President Bush's nominee for Education Secretary gained the post, the nominee said. A22</p>
