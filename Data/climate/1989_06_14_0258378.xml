        <p>LEAD: The sweeping clean-air proposals outlined by President Bush on Monday drew expressions of concern and confusion yesterday from many companies directly affected by the plan.</p>
        <p>The sweeping clean-air proposals outlined by President Bush on Monday drew expressions of concern and confusion yesterday from many companies directly affected by the plan.</p>
        <p>The President's plan, which Administration officials said would cost industry $14 billion to $18 billion a year, seeks to curb emissions that cause acid rain, to reduce smog-causing pollutants by tightening auto emission standards and encouraging use of alternative fuels, and to reduce by 75 to 90 percent the toxic industrial pollutants released into the air.</p>
        <p>''When you think that industry already spends something like $33 billion on pollution reduction, to put another $14 billion or $18 billion on top of that means this will have a significant influence on industry's costs,'' said Nigel Gault, an economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill.</p>
        <p>The plan would require heavy investments in new pollution-reducing equipment by electric utilities, oil and chemical companies and other industries. It would also force auto makers and oil companies to speed the pace of production of alternative fuels and vehicles that use them.</p>
        <p>Economists and industry executives said the proposals to reduce acid rain could result in higher electricity prices for consumers and industry in many parts of the country, putting pressure on the price of many manufactured goods. And the costs associated with cleaning up the air could diminish the ability of some companies to compete globally.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the plan could ultimately reduce the direct and indirect health care costs associated with air pollution, estimated by the American Lung Association to be $16 billion to $40 billion annually. It could force some companies to invest in more modern equipment that in the long run could make them more efficient.  Direct Benefits</p>
        <p>The plan would also bring direct benefits to companies that make pollution-reduction equipment. And it would of course provide the more intangible societal and environmental benefits that clean air brings.</p>
        <p>The coal, oil, auto and other industries that opposed efforts to strengthen the Clean Air Act prevailed throughout the 1980's in large part because President Reagan shared their views. With President Bush now calling for toughening the law, that balance of power has shifted radically. Business executives, environmentalists and members of Congress now agree that amendments to strengthen the law are nearly certain to pass in the 101st Congress.</p>
        <p>The lobbying efforts of industry and the environmental community will undoubtedly have some effect on the shape of the final legislation, but the internal dynamics of Congress will be the decisive factor. Lawmakers can be expected to fight to protect the interests of local industries, while some will push for stricter standards.  Stronger Bill Seen</p>
        <p>Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee's environmental pollution subcommittee, who is preparing the Senate's version of the clean-air amendments, said the bill that will be produced by Congress can only be stronger than the Bush plan.</p>
        <p>Many executives and economists seemed heartened that President Bush had chosen to allow market forces to work as much as possible in the pollution-reduction effort, most noticeably by permitting companies to trade the right to pollute.</p>
        <p>But they said it was too early to tell whether forcing industry to spend billions of dollars on reducing pollution was the best way for the economy and for society as a whole to spend that money. ''You have to compare that loss against the benefits you get in the form of reduced air pollution,'' said Mr. Gault of DRI. ''It's not clear how to decide on the trade-offs.''</p>
        <p>Following are discussions of how various industries are reacting:  ELECTRIC UTILITIES LIKE FLEXIBILITY</p>
        <p>The electric utility industry responded favorably yesterday to President Bush's proposal on reducing emissions that are the chief cause of acid rain, saying it provides them with greater flexibility than previous plans.</p>
        <p>But industry executives and analysts estimated that complying with the proposal could cost electric power companies from up to $8 billion a year and would greatly increase rates.</p>
        <p>The proposal being considered calls for a reduction of 10 million tons, or 50 percent, in sulfur dioxide emissions through restrictions on coal-burning power plants. It would also cut nitrogen oxide emissions by 2 million tons, or about 1 percent. The emissions are carried aloft by air currents and then return to earth, often in the form of acid rain or snow.  'Clean Coal' Technologies</p>
        <p>Power companies would be free to decide how they would comply. They could, for example, use scrubbers in their smokestacks to reduce emissions or simply burn coal with less sulfur. They could also encourage customers to conserve.</p>
        <p>''The most important feature of this proposal is the freedom of choice that it gives; however, it is also very important that companies have the time to implement the new technologies that are being developed,'' said Kurt Yeager, vice president of the generation and storage division of the Electric Power Research Institute, an industry group in Palo Alto, Calif.</p>
        <p>Some utilities are worried that the President's proposal does not provide enough time for the development of these new technologies. Utilities must decide by 1995 whether to add expensive scrubbers or to install clean coal technologies to meet a deadline of reducing emissions by 2000. The proposal allows three additional years for clean coal projects, but the critical decisions, the utilities said, must be made by 1995.  More Moderate Than E.P.A.</p>
        <p>Utilities said the President's plan is more moderate than one recently proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. Bush would require sulfur emission reductions to be spread among 107 power plants in 18 states, while the E.P.A. plan would have required more severe emission reductions at only 20 power plants.</p>
        <p>''We are pleased that the President decided against putting the most severe burden on the State of Ohio and the Midwest, but his clean-air proposal will still be expensive for Ohio consumers of electricity,'' said A. Joseph Dowd, senior vice president and general counsel for the American Electric Power Service Corporation, which serves much of the state.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dowd said the company could not determine the exact costs of the President's proposal - or the rate increases it would seek - until it has had a chance to run cost studies, but he said the clean-air proposals would have ''a substantial effect on rates.'' - CALVIN SIMS  COAL PRODUCERS SEE CONFUSION</p>
        <p>For companies that mine high-sulfur coal, the measures sought by President Bush to diminish sulfur emissions have created some confusion and a great deal of long-term concern.</p>
        <p>Producers of low-sulfur coal, however, view the President's proposal with considerable cheer. ''This will be good for companies like ours,'' said William J. Byrne Jr., a spokesman for the Pittston Company, a Greenwich, Conn., coal producer. ''Our reserves are 85 to 90 percent low-sulfur coal, so we feel we will be in good shape.''</p>
        <p>Low-sulfur coal, which usually costs more than high-sulfur coal, is produced in the West and in West Virginia and Kentucky and accounts for about 30 percent of United States coal reserves. High-sulfur coal is mined mainly in Eastern states like West Virginia and Kentucky.  Hinges on Utilities</p>
        <p>Coal company officials said yesterday that the impact of the proposed measures will hinge largely on what course utility companies pursue. Under the President's proposal, electric utilities, which consume 85 percent of the coal produced in the United States, can decide how to meet the emissions standards. If they find it cheaper to use scrubbers, the equipment on smokestacks that removes about 95 percent of the sulfur, the impact will be less severe on coal producers than if the utilities decide to buy more low-sulfur coal.</p>
        <p>Since low-sulfur coal represents about 35 percent of the reserves in this country, many producers are worried. ''It's going to create a considerable amount of disruption in the industry,'' said an official of a leading producer of high-sulfur coal.  A Drive for Scrubbers</p>
        <p>As a result, analysts say, many coal companies will probably begin a drive to get utilities to install scrubbers. How that effort fares will depend on whether utility companies find it cheaper to install the equipment, which can cost as much as $500 million at a large power plant, or to have the low-sulfur coal transported from regions where it is abundant.</p>
        <p>John L. C. Grasser, a spokesman for the National Coal Association, the Washington-based industry group that represents two-thirds of the nation's producers, said it was too soon to discern the impact on coal companies. ''It really depends on the various compliance strategies utility companies come up with,'' Mr. Grasser said. ''They will not have to decide until about three years before the 1995 deadline. Until then, we're in the dark.'' - JONATHAN P. HICKS  DETROIT CONCERNED ABOUT TIMETABLE</p>
        <p>The Big Three domestic auto makers said they agreed with President Bush's clean-air proposal in principle, but they are concerned about how quickly they will be required to reduce auto emissions. They do not have enough details to understand the full impact of the proposals, they said, and they are worried that Congress will impose tougher standards than the Administration wants.</p>
        <p>One Bush proposal calls for the use of cars that run on methanol in nine heavily polluted cities starting in 1995. Spokesmen for G.M., Ford and Chrysler said their companies supported further testing of alternative-fuel vehicles in pilot programs before mandating their use. G.M. and Ford are conducting pilot programs with California air quality officials, and Chrysler recently introduced a research vehicle that runs on methanol.  'Flexible' Idea Welcomed</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the General Motors Corporation said the company was heartened by the use of the word ''flexible'' several times in the proposal, as well as the concept of ''market-based'' approaches.</p>
        <p>Under the Bush proposals, the auto makers would be allowed to engage in ''emissions trading,'' a term whose meaning is not clear to the auto makers. Possibly, suggested one spokesman, an auto maker might trade reductions across several classes of vehicles or trade reduction of one type of pollutant for another.</p>
        <p>All three companies said they wondered how alternative fuels could be turned out in sufficient quantity for the cars to be produced under the President's guideline. Pointing out that alternative-fuel vehicles would be more expensive and would require refueling twice as often, company spokesmen said it was not yet clear why consumers would buy the vehicles without some kind of incentive.  Oil Tax Favored</p>
        <p>The Chrysler Corporation, however, said it favored taxing petroleum products to encourage the use of methanol. Chrysler also said incentives for alternative fuels should favor domestic production, since the cheapest methanol now available comes from the Middle East.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Ford Motor Company said the company was encouraged by aspects of the proposal requiring reductions in ''evaporative'' and ''running loss'' pollution, which it said can be accomplished through some vehicle-design changes and changes by the petroleum industry in the volatility of gasoline. These two types of pollution from unburned fuel are aggravated by hot outdoor temperatures. - DORON P. LEVIN  OIL COMPANIES SEE NEW MARKETS</p>
        <p>Increased use of natural gas and methanol in the nation's cars, buses and trucks could develop into profitable new markets for oil companies.</p>
        <p>But billions of dollars must be spent to add the pipelines, tanker trucks, storage tanks, service pumps and refineries to produce and deliver these cleaner-burning alternative fuels in large volumes.</p>
        <p>Oil industry executives and consultants said those costs must be included in the price the consumer eventually pays for cleaner fuels.</p>
        <p>''If you want a cleaner environment, you are going to have to pay for it, whether you use alternative fuels or existing fuels,'' said Kevin J. Lindemer, an analyst at Cambridge Energy Research Associates.</p>
        <p>Refining specialists said oil companies can reduce the amount of gasoline that contributes to smog, or low-level ozone, as it vaporizes by changing various blends used to produce the fuel. The added cost is estimated at $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion a year.  'Not as Dramatic'</p>
        <p>''It's not as dramatic as taking lead out of gasoline,'' said A. J. Phipps, senior principal with Purvin &amp; Gertz, a consulting firm in Houston.</p>
        <p>''It's clear that you can do it,'' said K. C. Bishop 3d, policy coordinator for environment and health issues at Chevron U.S.A., in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bishop cautioned that different, less-polluting blends are not used now because many car engines do not perform as well as with blends permitted under current E.P.A. standards. ''Frankly, there is a point where cars won't run as well,'' he said. ''But nobody knows where that point is.''</p>
        <p>The Coastal Corporation, a leading pipeline company that also operates a large chain of service stations across the Southeast, supports the President's endorsement of natural gas and methanol.  Costly for Consumer</p>
        <p>''We think the proposals would be good for the environment,'' said James Bailey, a spokesman. ''We would caution that they would be costly for the consumer.''</p>
        <p>Engineering specialists said a new methanol plant with capacity to produce a billion gallons annually would cost $1 billion and take two years to build. The United States produces about 1.5 billion gallons of methanol annually and about 110 billion gallons of gasoline.</p>
        <p>Even if methanol's price at the pump were similar to gasoline, another drawback to the fuel for consumers is that engines require twice as much methanol as gasoline to travel a similar distance.</p>
        <p>The price of compressed natural gas is now about 60 cents a gallon, compared with about $1.10 for gasoline or diesel fuel, and engines powered by compressed natural gas require only slightly more fuel per mile.</p>
        <p>Natural gas compressors that drivers could install at home for refueling overnight cost between $3,000 and $7,000. Gasoline engines can be converted for about $1,200.</p>
        <p>Until compressed natural gas becomes widely available through service stations, drivers are expected to be restricted to daily commuting. But some companies are already working to develop supply lines.</p>
        <p>Michael B. Barrett, president of the Natural Gas Company of Texas, said compressed natural gas could be commonly available in the Southwest by 1993. - THOMAS C. HAYES</p>
