        <p>LEAD: Following are excerpts from President Bush's speech on East-West relations here today:</p>
        <p>Following are excerpts from President Bush's speech on East-West relations here today:</p>
        <p>For 40 years, the seeds of democracy in Eastern Europe lay dormant, buried under the frozen tundra of the Cold War. And for 40 years, the world has waited for the Cold War to end. And decade after decade, time after time, the flowering human spirit withered from the chill of conflict and oppression. And again, the world waited.</p>
        <p>But the passion for freedom cannot be denied forever. The world has waited long enough. The time is right. Let Europe be whole and free. To the founders of the Alliance, this aspiration was a distant dream. And now it's the new mission of NATO.</p>
        <p>As President, I will continue to do all I can to help open the closed societies to the East. We seek self-determination for all of Germany and all of Eastern Europe. And we will -... and we will not relax, and we must not waver. Again, the world has waited long enough.</p>
        <p>So when I visit Poland and Hungary this summer, I will deliver this message: There cannot be a common European home until all within it are free to move from room to room. And I'll take another message: The path of freedom leads to a larger home, a home where West meets East, a democratic home, the commonwealth of free nations.</p>
        <p>And I said that positive steps by the Soviets would be met by steps of our own, and this is why I announced on May 12th a readiness to consider granting to the Soviets temporary waiver of the Jackson-Vanik trade restrictions if they liberalize emigration.</p>
        <p>And this is also why I announced on Monday that the United States is prepared to drop the ''no exceptions'' standard that has guided our approach to controlling the export of technology to the Soviet Union, lifting a sanction enacted in response to their invasion of Afghanistan.  4 Proposals for Unity</p>
        <p>And in this same spirit, in this same spirit, I set forth four proposals to heal Europe's tragic division, to help Europe become whole and free.</p>
        <p>First, I propose we strengthen and broaden the Helsinki process to promote free elections and political pluralism in Eastern Europe. As the forces of freedom and democracy rise in the East, so should our expectations. . . .</p>
        <p>In particular, the great political parties of the West must assume an historic responsibility to lend counsel and support to those brave men and women who are trying to form the first truly representative political parties in the East, to advance freedom and democracy, to part the Iron Curtain.</p>
        <p>Nowhere is the division between East and West seen more clearly than in Berlin. There the brutal wall cuts neighbor from neighbor, brother from brother. And that wall stands as a monument to the failure of communism. It must come down.</p>
        <p>Now, glasnost may be a Russian word, but ''openness'' is a Western concept. West Berlin has always enjoyed the openness of a free city, and our proposal would make all Berlin a center of commerce between East and West, a place of cooperation, not a point of confrontation. . . .</p>
        <p>This, then, is my second proposal: Bring glasnost to East Berlin.</p>
        <p>My generation remembers a Europe ravaged by war. And, of course, Europe has long since rebuilt its proud cities and restored its majestic cathedrals. But what a tragedy it would be if your continent was again spoiled, this time by a more subtle and insidious danger that the chancellor referred to, that of poisoned rivers, acid rain.</p>
        <p>So my third proposal is to work together on these environmental problems, with the United States and Western Europe extending a hand to the East.  Less Militarized Europe</p>
        <p>My fourth proposal, actually a set of proposals, concerns a less militarized Europe, the most heavily armed continent in the world. Nowhere is this more important than in the two Germanys.</p>
        <p>And that's why our quest to safely reduce armaments has a special significance for the German people. To those who are impatient with our measured pace in arms reduction, I respectfully suggest that history teaches us a lesson, that unity and strength are the catalyst and prerequisite to arms control. We've always believed that a strong Western defense is the best road to peace. And 40 years of experience have proven us right.</p>
        <p>In this era of both negotiation and armed camps, America understands that West Germany bears a special burden. . . . Not all free nations are called to endure the tension of regular military activity, or the constant presence of foreign military forces.</p>
        <p>We are sensitive to these special conditions that this needed presence imposes. To significantly ease the burden of armed camps in Europe, we must be aggressive in our pursuit of solid, verifiable agreements between NATO and the Warsaw Pact.</p>
        <p>On Monday, with my NATO colleagues in Brussels, I shared my great hope for the future of conventional negotiations in Europe. I shared with them a proposal for achieving significant reductions in the near future. And as you know, the Warsaw Pact has now accepted major elements of our Western approach to the new conventional arms negotiations in Vienna.</p>
        <p>The Eastern Bloc acknowledges that a substantial imbalance exists between the conventional forces of the two alliances, and they have moved closer to NATO's position by accepting most elements of our initial conventional arms proposal. These encouraging steps have produced the opportunity for creative and decisive action, and we shall not let that opportunity pass.</p>
        <p>Our proposal has several key initiatives. I propose that we lock the Eastern agreement to Western-proposed ceilings on tanks and armored troop carriers. We should also seek an agreement on common numerical ceilings for artillery, the range between NATO's and that of the Warsaw Pact, provided these definitional problems can be solved. And the weapons we remove must be destroyed.</p>
        <p>We should expand our current offer to include all land-based combat aircraft and helicopters by proposing that both sides reduce in these categories to a level 15 percent below the current NATO totals.  A Faster Timetable</p>
        <p>Given the Warsaw Pact's advantage in numbers, the pact would have to make far deeper reductions than NATO to establish parity at those lower levels. Again, the weapons we remove must be destroyed.</p>
        <p>I propose a 20-percent cut in combat manpower in U.S.-stationed forces, and a resulting ceiling on U.S. and Soviet ground and air forces stationed outside of national territory in the Atlantic-to-the-Urals zone at approximately 275,000 each. This reduction to parity, a fair and balanced level of strength, would compel the Soviets to reduce their 600,000-strong Red Army in Eastern Europe by 325,000. And these withdrawn forces must be demobilized.</p>
        <p>Finally, I call on President Gorbachev to accelerate the timetable for reaching these agreements. There is no reason why the five-to six-year timetable, as suggested by Moscow, is necessary.</p>
        <p>I propose a much more ambitious schedule. And we should aim to reach an agreement within six months to a year and accomplish reductions by 1992, or 1993 at the latest.</p>
        <p>These are my proposals to achieve a less militarized Europe. A short time ago, they would have been considered too revolutionary to consider, and yet today, we may well be on the verge of a more ambitious agreement than Europe, than anyone considered possible.</p>
