        <p>Rehabilitating Kudzu</p>
        <p>Q.</p>
        <p>Traveling through Georgia, I saw a vine called kudzu that seemed to be taking over everything. What is it? Will it invade the Northeast? How do you get rid of it?</p>
        <p>A.  Kudzu, often called the vine that ate the South, is a Chinese and Japanese fodder and cover crop with an edible root.</p>
        <p>The original Japanese pronunciation was kuzu, said Dr. Harry Amling, professor emeritus of horticulture at Auburn University in Auburn, Ala. The Latin name is Pueraria lobata, but it was called Pueraria thunbergiana until 1947.</p>
        <p>An American Consul in Japan in the late 19th century, Thomas Hogg, exported kudzu to the United States, where an excess of its virtues as an erosion-control planting eventually made it into a famous pest. Its twining vine stems can grow as much as a foot a day and may reach a length of more than 60 feet.</p>
        <p>But for decades, county agents and soil conservation scientists enthusiastically recommended kudzu as a ground cover, and it has many other virtues, Dr. Amling said. "It is a very nice pot plant, with sweet-smelling purple flowers," he said. "It was grown as a porch vine, to keep the sun off the porch. Kuzu starch, a fine-grain starch, is extracted from the roots and used in Japanese cooking. It can be made into noodles."</p>
        <p>"For two thousand years, the Japanese have extracted an antifever medicine from it," said Dr. Amling, who studied kudzu cultivation when the Japanese were working on developing a pure drug product.</p>
        <p>Kudzu can be put up as excellent hay, though modern haying equipment has a hard time handling the long vines, said Dr. Ronald Schumack, professor of horticulture at Auburn. Its appeal to grazing animals can be used to control it, he said. Bean Problems</p>
        <p>Q.</p>
        <p>What is it in beans that increases flatulence?</p>
        <p>A.  The problem is oligosaccharides, or "several-unit" sugars, which are produced by legumes, especially in the final stages of seed development, according to Harold McGee in "On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen" (Collier).</p>
        <p>The oligosaccharides, called raffinose, stachyose and verbascose, are used by the seeds to store energy. The human body lacks enzymes to break them down, and so cannot digest and absorb them as it does the simple sugars. Instead, they are digested in the colon by normal intestinal bacteria. In their metabolic process, the bacteria produce various gases, including carbon dioxide and hydrogen.</p>
        <p>The problem sugars are also found in cabbage-family vegetables, among many others, and in whole grains, brans and some other seeds.</p>
        <p>Soaking beans with frequent water changes and boiling them will help break down the sugars, as will germination into bean sprouts and fermentation into tofu, say two experts, Dr. Eric S. Rabkin and and Dr. Eugene M. Silverman. A product called Beano, made by Akpharma Inc. of Pleasantville, N.J., may also help. The soy-sauce-flavor drops, which are to be consumed with the first mouthful of food, contain the enzyme alpha-galactosidase, which breaks up the sugars. The commercial enzyme is made by the fungus Aspergillus niger.</p>
