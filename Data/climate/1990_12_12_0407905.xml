        <p>"This could be the dawn of a second golden age," one giddy scientist exulted after seeing the new high-level proposals for reorienting the space program. That prediction may prove hyperbolic. But the refreshingly sensible plan presented to the White House Monday by a panel of experts could at least rescue the space program from decay.</p>
        <p>The advice comes none too soon. The shuttle fleet is hobbled by delays. Cost estimates for the proposed space station are out of control. Talent is draining from the space agency. And vital scientific projects are being squeezed to insignificance.</p>
        <p>On the very day the new plan was issued, a space astronomy mission was limping home, its observations diminished by malfunctions, with no follow-up possible.</p>
        <p>The plan just proposed by a panel of 12 experts, at the request of Vice President Quayle, would go a long way toward correcting imbalances and defects in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The plan would wisely phase out the fragile space shuttle fleet. It remains vulnerable to another catastrophe, like the 1986 Challenger explosion, that could ground the fleet indefinitely. In place of the shuttle, large rockets would be developed to boost satellites, and astronauts, into orbit more cheaply, safely and reliably.</p>
        <p>NASA's most ambitious new program, the proposed space station, would be scaled down and given a more defensible mission. The station has long been promoted as an all-purpose space base -- a way station to the moon and Mars, a site for manufacturing exotic materials and a base for experiments. But its estimated cost has soared irresponsibly from $8 billion to $37 billion, forcing repeated re-evaluations.</p>
        <p>Now the expert panel has recommended a bare-bones mission -- studying the effects of space on human life -- for which no earthbound studies can substitute, thus allowing a much smaller and cheaper platform.</p>
        <p>Instead of grandiose engineering, the panel would make space science the highest goal of the agency. This is where the emphasis should be, especially now that the cold war rationale for the space race has vanished. The plan also endorses research from space on the environment, critical to learning whether global warming will become a disaster or a perturbation. And it urges that manned exploration be held within available funds.</p>
        <p>The plan embodies one questionable assumption: that the NASA budget will rise by 10 percent a year, after inflation, for most of the next decade.  That's much less than NASA's aspirations but may still be too high in an era when social programs are starved. The rationale for such an increase is weak; it deserves skeptical scrutiny from budget experts in the Administration and Congress.</p>
        <p>But whatever level of funding is set, the advisory panel has the priorities right. Its proposals deserve strong support from the Administration, Congress and anyone hopeful of reviving the floundering space program.</p>
