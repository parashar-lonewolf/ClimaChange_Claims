        <p>At first glance, the crystal looks like diamond, said Dr. Omar M. Yaghi, a professor of chemistry at the University of Michigan.</p>
        <p>But the crystal, colorless, is light. A cube of the material one inch on a side weighs about a twentieth of an ounce. To the eye, it looks solid, but a microscope would reveal a Swiss cheese of microscopic holes. The molecules in the crystal stack so loosely that that 95 percent of the volume is nothing, empty space.</p>
        <p>That is why Dr. Yaghi said, ''We think it's going to be very useful.''</p>
        <p>A crystal that is mostly empty is useful for storing stuff -- hydrogen, in particular.</p>
        <p>The compound is prosaically named Metal-Organic Framework No. 177, MOF-177 for short. Following in the steps of MOF-1 through MOF-176, it or one of its successors could become the fuel tank of the future.</p>
        <p>One hurdle in the envisioned switch to a ''hydrogen economy,'' displacing fossil fuels, is that hydrogen, a gas at room temperatures, is bulky. Now, fitting a reasonable amount of hydrogen into a regular-size fuel tank requires that the hydrogen be squeezed to very high pressures, creating a potential hazard in a collision, or cooled to very cold temperatures, considered impractical and inefficient. (The fuel would have to be chilled even when the car was parked.)</p>
        <p>Instead, Dr. Yaghi envisions the ephemeral crystals acting as hydrogen sponges, storing the gas at room temperatures under less pressure. Like a sponge, the surface area surrounding the holes is huge. If a one-inch cube of MOF-177 could be disassembled, unfolded and laid out, it would cover 38,000 square feet, or about two-thirds of a football field.</p>
        <p>Hydrogen and other molecules bind to the surfaces. Creating a crystal with more surface area enables more molecules to fit inside. ''Then you can pack these molecules onto a surface without having to apply a lot of pressure,'' Dr. Yaghi said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Yaghi and colleagues at the University of Michigan and Arizona State University report their findings in the Feb. 5 issue of the journal Nature.</p>
        <p>MOF-177 looks like a construct of Tinker Toys; a zinc oxide molecule acts as a central connecting spoke with stiff carbon-based rods radiating outward. ''My interest was in building structures from molecular building blocks,'' Dr. Yaghi said.</p>
        <p>The spokes and rods form a snowflakelike, three-dimensional lattice with plenty of empty space. Because the molecules are stiff, the crystal does not collapse like a balloon when air is sucked out of it.</p>
        <p>In the Nature paper, the scientists showed that they could fill a MOF-177 crystal with nitrogen and soccer-ball-shaped carbon molecules known as buckyballs. They showed 1.3 ounces of nitrogen could fit into a one ounce MOF-177 crystal. ''That went in quite easily,'' said Dr. Adam J. Matzger, a professor of chemistry at the University of Michigan and another author of the Nature paper.</p>
        <p>They also showed that even large molecules like those that used as colorful dyes could slide into the holes, tinting the clear crystal red, orange and green.</p>
        <p>Researchers led by Dr. Yaghi reported last year in the journal Science that an earlier compound, MOF-5, could absorb hydrogen concentrations of 1 percent by weight at room temperature and a pressure 20 times atmospheric pressure. MOF-177 has about 50 percent more surface area and Dr. Yaghi believes that sticking large molecules in the voids will further increase the surface area and the capacity.</p>
        <p>''They're interesting; they're innovative,'' said Dr. Michael D. Ward, director of the Materials Research Science and Engineering Center at the University of Minnesota. ''It remains to be seen if they're integrated into a hydrogen economy.''</p>
        <p>The Department of Energy estimates that practical hydrogen storage will require concentrations of at least 6.5 percent.</p>
