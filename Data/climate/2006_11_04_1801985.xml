        <p>Imagine a Manhattan given over to a new Central Park, with a crystalline city floating above it.</p>
        <p>Or a series of self-propelled islands floating around Manhattan, docking as needed and providing extra space for concerts and green markets (or cordoning off visiting dignitaries so that their caravans don't disrupt traffic).</p>
        <p>Or that the populations of Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and the Bronx have been moved into Manhattan and stacked 65 stories high, so that those four boroughs could be used purely as green space.</p>
        <p>These were among the 10 radical, sometimes quirky, visions of New York 100 years from now, presented by teams of architects and engineers in a competition that ended on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Organized in connection with ''Engineering an Empire,'' a History Channel series that examines the achievements of ancient civilizations, the competition called for each team to design a 22nd-century ''City of the Future'' for a prize of $10,000. Similar competitions are to be held in Chicago on Nov. 17 and in Los Angeles on Dec. 8. A national champion will ultimately be selected from among the three winning teams and awarded another $10,000.</p>
        <p>In New York the firms, all local ones, were handed their challenge on Oct. 26 at 5:30 a.m. Their brief was to envision the city in 2106, striving for a high level of innovation and technological sophistication. Polished presentations were due a week later, at 5:30 a.m. on Thursday. Assembling at 8:30 a.m., the teams had four hours to put the presentations together in the Vanderbilt Room of Grand Central Terminal.</p>
        <p>''Rome wasn't built in a day, and I'm now pretty sure New York can't be built in a week,'' said one of the competing architects, Craig Konyk.</p>
        <p>At 12:30 p.m., time ran out. ''Teams, please stop building,'' ordered the architect Casey Jones, who with Reed Kroloff, his partner, was a competition adviser. ''Time is up.''</p>
        <p>Then the judges filed in: the architects David Rockwell and Billie Tsien; Ray Gastil, the Manhattan office director of the city's Department of City Planning; Terrence O'Neal, president of the New York State chapter of the American Institute of Architects; and Paul Goldberger, architecture critic at The New Yorker.</p>
        <p>During the next three hours, the judges moved from one project to another, asking questions. ''What is happening in the other boroughs?'' Ms. Tsien asked the Urban Research Group, the team that suggested emptying every borough except Manhattan of its inhabitants. ''Whatever the city needs to support itself,'' replied Moji Baratloo, one of the group's architects. ''It's a conceptual idea to understand what it would mean to free up land.''</p>
        <p>As Laurie Hawkinson of Smith-Miller &amp; Hawkinson Architects sought to defend her team's presentation, Mr. Goldberger suggested that it wasn't architectural: a series of postcards depicting New York as the architects hoped or expected it would be. The computer-generated images included a giant pool in place of Central Park; an all-night golf course; a yellow cab that would take a passenger from New York to Boston in 45 minutes (at $7 a mile); a hot dog served by a mechanical arm; street signs in Chinese as well as English.</p>
        <p>Diane Lewis and colleagues at Diane Lewis Architect drew on a History Channel program on ancient Rome, ''not to see history as something past, but as a structural example,'' she said. (That segment won an Emmy Award for picture editing this year, and each team in this competition was sent a copy as possible inspiration.)</p>
        <p>She created what she called a ''quadrata,'' with major streets going down one mile and up one mile, forming an overall cube. ''The Romans looked at infrastructure as architectural,'' Ms. Lewis said in an interview. ''Quadrants were connected into the grid of the city.''</p>
        <p>The Lewis team also created its own social institutions in place of Roman models -- instead of the Forum, a United Nations for Freedom of the Press; rather than a Pantheon, an international peace institute. ''We are interested in a postphilanthropic Manhattan,'' Ms. Lewis said. (In deliberating later, the judges agreed that this was an intriguing idea that had not been sufficiently developed.)</p>
        <p>The team from Konyk Architecture came up with ''Cloud 09,'' a city floating in air. It included a vertical subway system of high-speed lifts, or ''vrams''; annexed Hudson and eastern Bergen counties in New Jersey; and envisioned office buildings as so technologically advanced that ''business travel would cease to exist,'' Mr. Konyk said. ''Travel would be strictly for recreational purposes.''</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Neal asked: ''Where do you see the common man in your vision?''</p>
        <p>With computers in every school, Mr. Konyk replied, ''I think the common man is technically advanced.''</p>
        <p>Sustainability was a common theme. ''How can we use New York as a model for the rest of the world to create a sustainable environment?'' asked Jonathan Marvel of Rogers Marvel Architects. His team conceived of parkland that would create a green ribbon around the edge of Manhattan and a system of pneumatic tubes that would collect and tag sorted household waste for recycling. These are ''all ways you as an inhabitant take an active role in solving problems of sustainability on an active scale,'' Mr. Marvel said.</p>
        <p>The top prize went to the team from the Architecture Research Office firm, which, acknowledging global warming and climactic change, explored the idea of harnessing the water that would ultimately flood the streets. Avenues would become ''vanes,'' watery channels with buildings above them, a team member, Adam Yarinsky, suggested.</p>
        <p>The group's formal proposal invoked modern and ancient architectural precedents. ''If the Miesian skyscraper and the Parisian arcade can account for one-half of the vane's pedigree,'' the team said in its presentation materials, ''the aqueduct and the Roman baths answer for the other.''</p>
        <p>After the judges' hasty deliberations, Daniel L. Doctoroff, the city's deputy mayor for economic development, presented the prizes. He said his office was preoccupied by many of the same concerns as the contestants -- ''parks and open space and pedestrianization and transportation'' -- though it might not be looking quite as far ahead.</p>
        <p>''It's so exciting for me to see this group of architects and designers think so creatively about the future,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marvel's team won the honorary mention for technological advancement. The Terreform group won the mention for best presentation, with a proposal that involved eliminating privately owned cars in Manhattan; it predicted that 60 percent of the city's population would be walking to work by 2038.</p>
        <p>Over all, the proposals conveyed a confidence that amid energy shortages, population increases and global warming, New York's urban problems could be addressed and even solved.</p>
        <p>Surveying the flooded streets in the Architecture Research Office proposal, Ms. Tsien asked, ''Do you see it as optimistic or elegiac?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Yarinsky replied: ''I see it as optimistic. The way a city transforms.''</p>
