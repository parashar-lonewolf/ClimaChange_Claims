        <p>Despite their strained relations, the United States and China have embarked on a program of environmental cooperation to address problems like rapid urbanization, pollution from energy consumption and the changing agricultural patterns of an increasingly prosperous population.</p>
        <p>White House officials said a three-day meeting of senior agency officials from both nations at the White House last week was especially noteworthy because it occurred at a time when Chinese-American relations have been strained by differences over Taiwan and other trade and security issues.</p>
        <p>They said the talks were the kind of step that Secretary of State Warren Christopher has been calling for in an attempt to put more focus on global environmental concerns as a central element of foreign policy.</p>
        <p>"It is significant that this is moving forward with high-level backing when there are so many things going wrong with the relationship," an Administration official said. "The environment is a priority that supersedes those problems."</p>
        <p>The meetings involved dozens of fairly senior officials -- assistant secretaries and vice ministers -- from agencies involved in energy, agriculture, environment, urban affairs, disaster relief and other such technical and economic fields. Hui Yong-zheng, vice minister of the State Science and Technology Commission, led the Chinese delegation. Mr. Clinton's science advisor, Jack Gibbons, attended about half the three-day session, and Vice President Al Gore also took part briefly.</p>
        <p>White House officials said Mr. Gore and Prime Minister Li Peng consider the talks a preliminary step toward a permanent, high-level relationship aimed at what specialists call "sustainable development." That philosophy assumes that economic growth, especially in countries that are advancing rapidly, like China, must be carefully managed to ensure that such growth does not impose unacceptable costs in environmental degradation and depletion of resources.</p>
        <p>The talks were not intended to be negotiating sessions over particular projects or decisions, such as whether the Export-Import Bank of the United States will subsidize loans to American companies for construction of the Three  Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River, American officials said. That enormous project  has been strongly criticized by environmentalists, and the Administration has recommended against the bank providing financing.</p>
        <p>An American participant in the talks said he was impressed with the depth of  understanding displayed by the Chinese over the complexities of balancing economic and environmental considerations, the potential for achieving both sets of objectives at once, and the importance of doing so. Chinese delegates emphasized that China's new five-year plan, the Government's central declaration of policies, is a turning point in its explicit and detailed commitments to sustainable development.</p>
        <p>China, with its huge population, rapid economic growth and accelerating urbanization, has long been recognized both as a nation with serious environmental problems and as a major market for environmental technologies, an  area in which the United States is a world leader.</p>
        <p>Among the problems discussed at the meeting, according to American participants, were these:</p>
        <p>*China's enormous demand for new electric-generating capacity, which is expected to be met primarily with coal-fired power plants. That causes two main  kinds of problems: acid rain in China, and a big source of carbon dioxide, one of the greenhouse gases that threatens to cause global warming.</p>
        <p>*China's agricultural needs, which are shifting as the population eats more meat, as China imports more grain, and as arable land is converted to industrial and urban uses.</p>
        <p>*The difficulties of housing, transportation and pollution control in growing coastal cities, and whether they can be relieved by planning more growth in smaller cities.</p>
        <p>"The Chinese appear virtually certain to emerge as one of the largest economies on earth in the next century," an American official said. "With growth of 10 percent a year, their environmental problems can accelerate rapidly, and that can have a profound impact."</p>
        <p>Both nations, in different ways, are major players in deciding whether emissions of greenhouse gases can be controlled in the century ahead. The United States is by far the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide. It could be the leader in technologies to cut those emissions, but so far has failed to live up to its  pledge to quickly cut its emissions, which continue to grow. China is the leading example of a fast-growing new contributor to the atmospheric burden of carbon dioxide.</p>
