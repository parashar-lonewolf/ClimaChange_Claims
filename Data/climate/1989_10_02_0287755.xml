        <p>LEAD: When an underground steam pipe exploded with a thunderous roar in the Gramercy Park section of Manhattan Aug. 19, killing three people, injuring 24 and coating much of the area with asbestos-contaminated mud, New York City officials assumed they were dealing with a phenomenon that happened once in a blue moon.</p>
        <p>When an underground steam pipe exploded with a thunderous roar in the Gramercy Park section of Manhattan Aug. 19, killing three people, injuring 24 and coating much of the area with asbestos-contaminated mud, New York City officials assumed they were dealing with a phenomenon that happened once in a blue moon.</p>
        <p>''They're very, very rare,'' Deputy Mayor Robert Esnard said on Sept. 1.</p>
        <p>But as Consolidated Edison subsequently acknowledged, the only thing rare about the Gramercy Park incident was the tremendous force of the blast and the large-scale disruption that followed, as more than 200 families were evacuated for a cleanup that still continues. Pipes Have Been Blowing for Decades</p>
        <p>In fact, Con Edison and city records made available so far indicate that the high-pressure steam pipes, part of an ingenious 107-year-old heating and power-generating system that exists only in Manhattan, have been blowing up with some regularity for decades.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the events of recent weeks -including two more steam pipe explosions -suggest that the rate may be increasing.</p>
        <p>Although the precise causes of the latest steam-pipe incidents remain under investigation, they have raised the question of whether the the city's aging underground infrastructure is seriously disintegrating, and whether that distintegration has begun to accelerate recently.</p>
        <p>Many experts and Con Edison workers say the whole latticework of pipes under the city's streets, including water mains, gas lines and electric cables, is crumbling from age, inadequate or nonexistent maintenance and, in some cases, human error.</p>
        <p>The explosions have added a new category to New York City's street hazards, which have long included falling debris, speeding bicyclists and toppling construction cranes. As one newspaper cartoonist observed last week, New Yorkers accustomed to looking left, right and up might start looking down as well.</p>
        <p>Since the Gramercy Park blast, there have been three more incidents - on Sept. 3, Sept. 6 and Sept. 25 - in which asbestos-lined steam pipes spread large amounts of the microscopic fibers into the environment.</p>
        <p>Since 1973, Con Edison records show, steam-pipe explosions have occured at the rate of one a year. Two people were killed in explosions on June 22, 1977 and May 12, 1981, and some earlier blasts also caused extensive property damage. On Nov. 8, 1977, there were even two in one day. #604 Water-Main Breaks Some experts suspect that many of the steam pipe incidents may result not so much from poor maintenance or flaws in the steam system, but from the deterioration of the city's water mains, which have been breaking much more frequently than the steam pipes have been exploding.</p>
        <p>In the year that ended last June 30 there were 604 water-main breaks, and there are more every year. City officials say that is partly a consequence of age and wear and tear. More than half of the mains were installed before 1940 and are made of cast iron, which, over time, becomes rusty and brittle.</p>
        <p>The water mains - 5,733 miles of them in Manhattan, compared with 103 miles of steam pipes - can hasten corrosion on adjacent steam pipes, weakening them and exposing their asbestos linings.</p>
        <p>The presence of water pouring from broken mains was a contributing, if not primary, factor in at least a third of the 20 known steam pipe blasts since 1973 - including the one in Gramercy Park. Water Hammer Bursts Pipe</p>
        <p>By pooling around the hot pipes, the water can create the conditions for an explosion. Cool water outside hastens condensation inside the pipe; if enough of the water produced inside is not drained out before the steam is turned back on, a high-pressure pulse called a water hammer can result.</p>
        <p>The steam pipes include five-foot-long accordion-like segments called expansion joints that are designed to absorb some of this pressure. But if the pipe contains too much cool water, as the Gramercy Park one apparently did, the energy released when steam pressurized to 150 to 200 pounds per square inch collides with the water will be more than enough to blow the expansion joint to bits.</p>
        <p>In many of the prior explosions, including the Gramercy Park blast, workers had turned the steam off hours before to repair steam leaks or nearby water main breaks - a routine process that utility officials say is performed at least two or three times a day in Manhattan. Insulation Is Swept Off</p>
        <p>Another connection between water-main leaks and steam pipe problems was graphically illustrated last month, on Eighth Avenue between West 44th and 51st Streets. There, on Sept. 3, an ancient water main - one scheduled to be replaced - burst, and the force of the water swept asbestos insulation from two partly corroded steam mains.</p>
        <p>The flood of asbestos-laden water closed eight blocks of Eighth Avenue and a half-mile stretch of IND subway tracks, which were heavily contaminated with water-logged clumps of amosite, a particularly hazardous type of asbestos that is in the insulation lining of 75 percent of the steam pipes.</p>
        <p>Although Eighth Avenue was reopened after two days of round-the-clock scrubbing, the subway tracks were only restored to service yesterday, after a $1.6 million cleanup. The re-routing or cancellations of the A train and others affected half a million riders a day. Twenty-four subway cars must still be decontaminated. 'You Look for Leaks, for Example'</p>
        <p>Con Edison officials insist that maintenance on steam pipes is a relatively simple process that is regularly performed by trained workers.</p>
        <p>''This is not a complicated mechanism that you have to go in and oil,'' a utility spokesman, Martin F. Gitten, said last week. ''Basically, you look for signs of trouble - for leaks in the pipe, for example. You also want to make sure the valves are in good working order, that the water traps are clear.''</p>
        <p>But Local 1-2 of the Utility Workers of America, which represents many of Con Edison's 200 steam workers, argues that reductions in crew sizes and the utility's closing of a special school for steam mechanics have sown the seeds of more disasters.</p>
        <p>Two of the three killed in the Gramercy Park explosion were union workers;the other was a 28-year-old woman in a third-floor bedroom at 32 Gramercy Park South. Two other union workers were severely burned. Union Wants Answers</p>
        <p>Among the other things, the union has demanded to know whether the Con Edison supervisor on the scene properly inspected the Gramercy Park steam main - and a balky water-drainage valve - before he ordered the steam turned back on. An elaborate check-off procedure must be followed whenever steam valves are turned on or off, which includes notifying a dispatcher at one of the utility's seven steam generating stations.</p>
        <p>''Chances are no inspections took place because the company was in a hurry to get the steam lines open again,'' the union's business manager, Eugene T. Briody, asserted.</p>
        <p>''In its compulsive drive to increase profits and earn productivity bonuses for top management officials, Con Edison, over the last several years, has adopted a policy of speeded-up crew reductions and corner-cutting,'' Mr. Briody said. ''We call it 'productivity before safety.' '' Con Ed Says Training Better</p>
        <p>Con Edison spokesmen deny the accusation, saying that while there are 5,000 fewer utility workers now than in 1967, the remaining workers are more productive and equally well trained.</p>
        <p>''We deal with large amounts of energy in different forms - electricity, gas and steam - and part of our training program is to teach people respect for what they're dealing with,'' said Con Edison's president, Eugene R. McGrath. ''And there is certainly no lack of people on this job. There was a crew of five at Gramercy Park.''</p>
        <p>The utility has rejected suggestions that asbestos lining be removed from pipes, saying digging them all up would be impractical and far too expensive. However, Con Edison recently announced plans to remove asbestos from 700 of the 1,700 steam-pipe manholes where it is still present.</p>
        <p>Some have suggested that the most expeditious solution may be simply to shut the steam system down and let Con Edison and its 2,000 steam customers find other ways to generate electricity, heat buildings, heat water and run elevators and air conditioners. Air Pollution the Alternative</p>
        <p>Disagreement with that solution is the one point on which the union and the utility agree.</p>
        <p>''I believe that, with proper maintenance and adequate inspections, steam is the way to go,'' Mr. Briody said. ''It's the cleanest source of energy we have.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McGrath said the alternatives to steam are oil or other fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>''If we were to shut down the steam supply, in many cases it would be replaced by small boilers located in various places throughout the city,'' he said. ''That would create air-pollution problems.</p>
        <p>''The steam system is also one of the largest co-generation systems in the world,'' Mr. McGrath said. ''It's very efficient and it saves our customers costs. If we were to shut it down, we would have to find another source of electrical power.''</p>
