        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You write in your Dec. 13 editorial about the meeting on climate change in Montreal that Britain and Canada ''deserve considerable praise,'' but that ''the Bush administration deserves only censure.''</p>
        <p>The United States indeed has yet to step up as a leader in the fight against climate change, but holding up Canada and Britain as role models is ridiculous.</p>
        <p>Canada has ratified the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, but Canada's greenhouse gas emissions have increased 24 percent over its levels in 1990, even though Canada has committed itself to reducing its greenhouse gas production by 6 percent from 1990 levels by 2012. Canada's plans to meet its Kyoto goals are widely expected to fail.</p>
        <p>The situation in Britain is more promising, but only because Britain has closed many of its coal mines after realizing losses, and so has decreased carbon dioxide production without corresponding consumption decreases.</p>
