        <p>Buses powered by compressed natural gas -- long viewed as the cleanest alternative to diesel buses -- are no better for the environment than buses powered by a combination of diesel and electricity, according to a study that could have broad implications for vehicle fleets nationwide.</p>
        <p>Municipal transportation agencies around the country have come under pressure to switch to natural gas buses as a way to reduce pollution, with Los Angeles and other cities converting their whole fleets to this technology. But New York City, which has enormous influence on the bus market because of the size of its purchases, has resisted, citing huge costs and concerns about dangers associated with compressed natural gas.</p>
        <p>The study, by a group that analyzes vehicle pollution for the federal government, is likely to shift the bus debate at a time when all the leading automakers are pushing ahead with the development of electric-and-fuel hybrid cars and light-duty trucks.</p>
        <p>''In our opinion, this confirms what we've been saying about the hybrid electric technology,'' said Lawrence G. Reuter, president of New York City Transit, which runs a fleet of 4,300 buses, the largest in the country, 90 of them powered by natural gas and 6 now being tested with hybrid electric engines.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reuter added: ''You will see us moving faster into the hybrid technology field.''</p>
        <p>Diesel fuel produces more potentially hazardous pollution, known as particulate matter, than natural gas. But the study found that some diesel-electric hybrid engines were built in a way that made the release of such pollution no greater than that given off by natural gas engines.</p>
        <p>However, environmental advocates who have pushed for natural gas buses immediately criticized the study, saying that while it might show that natural gas and hybrid buses can produce comparably low levels of the pollution known as particulate matter, it did not analyze the toxic qualities of those tiny particles.</p>
        <p>Some scientific evidence suggests that tiny diesel particles, unlike those from natural gas engines, can worsen asthma. The diesel particles have also been listed as a possible carcinogen by the California Air Resources Board, though other groups have disputed this finding. ''It's impossible for us to accept the notion of a clean diesel without knowing the toxicity,'' said Richard Kassel, a senior lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council.</p>
        <p>As the debate over cleaner buses has played out over the last decade, New York City has been the only city in the nation to put a significant amount of money into hybrid diesel technology for its bus fleet.</p>
        <p>A large part of the reason is that, while natural gas buses are now cheaper to buy than hybrid buses, it can cost anywhere from $25 million to $40 million to convert a city bus depot so that it can refuel and service natural gas buses safely.</p>
        <p>Officials have also become concerned about the hazards of natural gas after a series of small explosions forced a depot in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, to shut down last November. Three transit workers received minor injuries and were hospitalized.</p>
        <p>Six hybrid buses -- propelled by electric motors that draw their current from a small diesel engine on board -- are being tested along Riverside Drive and on a route from the Upper West Side to La Guardia Airport. The city has ordered 125 more, expected to be in service by late 2001, along with 135 natural gas buses.</p>
        <p>The only other cities expressing an interest in the hybrid buses are Tempe, Ariz., which has ordered 30 smaller hybrid diesels, and Boston, which is now testing two on the streets, said Sheila Lynch, the executive director of the Northeast Alternative Vehicle Consortium, the nonprofit agency that oversaw the bus tests.</p>
        <p>About 30 municipal bus agencies -- including those in Atlanta, Los Angeles, Sacramento, Cleveland and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Long Island fleet -- are now buying only compressed natural gas buses.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Lynch said that if the study prompted New York City to move faster into testing and buying hybrid buses, other cities could follow suit and push down the costs of producing them. A hybrid bus costs about $385,000 and a natural gas bus is about $325,000. ''The M.T.A. usually drives what happens in the rest of the bus market,'' Ms. Lynch said.</p>
        <p>The trucking industry is also looking into diesel-electric hybrids for smaller trucks typically used for urban deliveries, and the military wants to develop heavy-duty diesel hybrids because the engines produce little heat and are harder to detect by surveillance equipment.</p>
        <p>The bus tests, conducted over the spring and fall of last year in Boston and Brooklyn, found that diesel-hybrid buses equipped with pollution-exhaust traps and using special low- sulfur fuel produced so little particle pollution that it could not be detected by engineers' machines. The hybrid buses did, however, produce more nitrogen oxide, which contributes to ground-level ozone. The natural gas buses also produced too little particle pollution to be detected, though they produced more carbon dioxide, a significant greenhouse gas.</p>
        <p>Thomas Balon, a senior project manager for M. J. Bradley, an environmental consulting company that performed the tests, said that the particles produced by both the natural gas bus and the hybrid bus would add up to probably less than a pound a year per bus, compared with as much as 42 pounds per year from a traditional diesel bus.</p>
        <p>Advocates of natural gas buses said they considered the study to be further flawed because the hybrid buses being tested on New York City streets do not use the low-sulfur fuel that was used in the study. Moreover, they noted that the low-sulfur fuel was not widely available in the United States.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Reuter, the New York City Transit president, said that the agency has begun testing the low-sulfur fuel and if the tests proved successful, the city would begin trying to  persuade fuel companies to produce and sell it, for use in both the hybrids and the city's regular diesel buses. Though the fuel costs about 10 cents per gallon more than regular diesel fuel, the increased cost, he said, would ultimately be less than converting the depots for fueling natural-gas buses.</p>
        <p>The city's long-range goal is to develop, within 10 years, electric buses that use fuel cells, a technology that would power buses entirely with devices that make electricity through chemical reactions rather than combustion. Those buses would produce no emissions.</p>
        <p>Environmental advocates applaud the plan, but many say that until that technology is developed, they remain committed to pushing for an end to reliance on diesel, even in hybrids.</p>
        <p>''We recognize that we are asking the M.T.A. to undertake a major change in its bus fleet,'' Mr. Kassel said, ''but we believe the environmental benefits are worth it.''</p>
        <p>Joanna D. Underwood, president of Inform, a New York-based environmental research organization that has also pushed for an end to diesel, added that she believed it also made no sense for cities to begin relying on the still-developing diesel-hybrid technology, at a time when the cleanliness of natural gas buses  had already been proved.</p>
        <p>''The choices between these buses,'' Ms. Underwood said, ''is really not equal.''</p>
