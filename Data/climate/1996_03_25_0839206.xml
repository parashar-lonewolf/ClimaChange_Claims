        <p>Northwesterners for More Fish. The words conjure up visions of earth-shoed activists and leaping trout joined in battle against the greedy pillagers of the land.</p>
        <p>That is just the kind of image a group of Washington consultants had in mind  when they named this "grassroots coalition" for their new clients: big utilities and other companies in the Northwest under attack by environmental groups for depleting the fish population.</p>
        <p>To environmentalists, Northwesterners for More Fish is just the latest example of "greenscamming," the increasingly common practice of giving environmentally friendly names to groups whose agendas have little to do with the welfare of the environment.</p>
        <p>Examples of such groups abound. In Riverside County, Calif., a public relations firm organized Friends of Eagle Mountain on behalf of a mining company that wants to create the world's largest landfill in an abandoned iron ore pit.  The National Wetlands Coalition was formed to fight the Endangered Species Act.</p>
        <p>And a measure on the California ballot this Tuesday pits the Californians for Balanced Wildlife Management against the California Wildlife Protection Coalition over the hunting of mountain lions. The first group wants to kill them and the second wants to save them.</p>
        <p>Even as the public has become disillusioned with large corporations, government and other American institutions, the environmental movement has remained widely popular. The widespread use of environmentally friendly names is industry's grudging tribute to the environmental movement.</p>
        <p>A Gallup Poll last year showed that 63 percent of Americans considered themselves "environmentalists," while 34 percent did not. Sixty-two percent said they would give priority to the environment over economic growth while 32 percent said they would give economic growth priority over the environment.</p>
        <p>"No one wants to dance with the devil, so they try to come up with a name that's not too devilish," said Bennett Beach, a spokesman for the Wilderness Society. "I suspect that as the country's becoming more and more environmentally sensitive, it's more difficult to be burdened with a name that speaks the truth  about your intentions."</p>
        <p>One nemesis of the Wilderness Society is the National Wilderness Institute, a group formed in recent years to roll back wetlands regulation in the Endangered  Species Act. Though groups like this one assert that environmental regulations are overly burdensome and unnecessary, they recognize the value of an environmentally friendly name.</p>
        <p>Other groups that environmentalists consider foes are the Wilderness Impact Research Foundation, a Nevada organization that represents logging, ranching and related interests; the American Environmental Foundation, a Florida property-rights group; the Abundant Wildlife Society of North America, which advocates for hunters, loggers and miners, and the Global Climate Coalition, an  association of corporations concerned about regulations to control global warming.</p>
        <p>"People sometimes create groups that try to fudge a little bit about what their goals are," said Hal Dash, the president of Cerrell Associates, a public relations firm in Los Angeles that has represented clients with environmental problems. "They want to create a patina of good guy-ness."</p>
        <p>Mr. Dash, who represents the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, said he "fiddled with a lot of names" that he might have used for his client in  a California campaign regarding requirements for electric cars.</p>
        <p>"But we decided in our case it was silly, and the best thing to do was be the American Automobile Manufacturers Association," he said. "The press has spent less time worrying about a front group and more focusing on the issue."</p>
        <p>In the case of Northwesterners for More Fish, the organization is barely three months old, and environmentalists are trying to "out" it.</p>
        <p>One of its chief organizers is Eddie Mahe Jr., a veteran Washington political strategist and former deputy chairman of the Republican National Committee. Mr.  Mahe and five other Washington insiders developed a plan several months ago to organize the groups as a grass-roots coalition in the Northwest, according to a  planning memorandum given to The Times by environmentalists.</p>
        <p>Its aim is to defeat environmentalists who say that utilities, aluminum companies and the timber industry are destroying fish habitats on the Columbia and other rivers. Chief among the environmental groups is Trout Unlimited, perhaps the inspiration for the new group's name.</p>
        <p>Northwesterners for More Fish has a budget of $2.6 million for the next year  to pay for the costs of establishing itself "as a credible group supporting positive solutions to enhancing fish populations," according to the memorandum.  The group aims to limit Federal efforts to protect endangered fish species if the efforts might interfere with industries that rely on the river.</p>
        <p>The budget includes $800,000 for television and radio advertisements and $100,000 to influence members of the news media. "The goal of this operation will be to identify supportive media and feed them information to complement and reinforce the paid media effort," the memorandum said.</p>
        <p>"While the public can and should be swayed by having the facts on the issue,  the message must also appeal at a gut, emotional level," the memorandum said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mahe's office referred calls about the group to a consultant in the Seattle area, Kay Gabriel, who said that she was not free to say what companies  were paying the bills for the group. She said the group advocates "barging" fish around dams.</p>
        <p>The Washington Water and Power Company provided a luncheon buffet for an organizing meeting of Northwesterners for More Fish in Spokane on Feb. 16 that followed a briefing by Senator Slade Gorton, Republican of Washington. Also present was an aide to Senator Larry E. Craig, Republican of Idaho.</p>
        <p>It could not be learned who attended the session, but the list of invitees included mostly representatives of aluminum, chemical, mining, oil, power and timber companies.</p>
        <p>"They don't give a damn about fish," said Glen Spain, the Northwest regional  director of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations. "This is an ersatz organization. It's like a Styrofoam dummy; it has no relationship to anything but the industries and their vested Federal coffer porkbarrel products."</p>
        <p>Mr. Spain said his organization was actually a federation of fishermen's associations.</p>
