        <p>LEAD: EVERY week, David Grainger spends about 40 hours of his spare time on a project he hopes will help people to influence their legislators' votes on issues like gun control and apartheid.</p>
        <p>EVERY week, David Grainger spends about 40 hours of his spare time on a project he hopes will help people to influence their legislators' votes on issues like gun control and apartheid.</p>
        <p>Working in a tiny basement office in his Noank home, surrounded by saws and paint cans, Mr. Grainger produces a weekly one-page flier called ''Of, By and For the People.'' Each flier draws together information on various issues, tells readers of upcoming legislative action and includes telephone numbers of legislators to make it easier for readers to call and express their views.</p>
        <p>In the first issue of the flier, which came out on Sept. 19, Mr. Grainger urged, ''Call Senator Dodd, 1-800-334-5341, thank him for supporting the South African sanctions bill, let him know how you feel about the sale of semiautomatic rifles.''</p>
        <p>''Obviously, it's a selective consolidation,'' Mr. Grainger said of the information he publishes. He selects issues that he considers important, including acid rain, civil rights and world peace. He does not aim to be neutral, but to help those who share his concerns to take action. ''I've been wanting to do something that speaks to my conscience, satisfies my desire to improve conditions, change things,'' he said.  A Vietnam Veteran</p>
        <p>Mr. Grainger, a Vietnam veteran, is married and has two teen-age children. ''Processing the whole Vietnam experience, I came to the conclusion that the Government isn't always right,'' he said, ''and that its wrongness can be responsible for loss of life.''</p>
        <p>A carpenter by trade, he has been active for more than a decade in groups that address issues like peace in Central America. He once traveled to Nicaragua on a fact-finding mission coordinated by Witness for Peace, an international organization.</p>
        <p>But he found that whenever he worked on one issue, he had to neglect others. ''You don't have time to put full commitment into a variety of issues,'' he said, adding that just making a living as a carpenter took up a great deal of time.</p>
        <p>He explained that it bothered him to neglect some issues he cared about. ''For instance, I care about the environment, but I wasn't doing anything about it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grainger reasoned that other people must share his problem of having more concern than time. He decided that a flier would alert people to the status of particular issues so that they could call their elected representatives to enlist their support. ''I didn't think there was a clearinghouse designed for people who are busy, who don't have time to join a group for each issue,'' he said. ''So I decided to start one.''  No Fancy Equipment</p>
        <p>He did not wait to assemble fancy office equipment, but swung into action with a telephone, an answering machine, a word processor, two boxes with hanging files, a table and a mimeograph machine on loan from a local church. ''The need is great at this particular time, with a new session of Congress and so many issues to deal with,'' he said. ''I decided to get going.''</p>
        <p>In his fliers, Mr. Grainger deals with some strictly local issues, like a proposed toxic waste incinerator in the Town of Groton, of which Noank is a part. But he usually focuses on national and international issues.</p>
        <p>Each Friday, he telephones about 20 groups, including Amnesty International, Handgun Control Inc., the Sierra Club, Witness for Peace and the Washington Office on Africa, an anti-apartheid organization sponsored by several church groups. He speaks with the lobbyists for the groups and finds out what Congress is scheduled to vote on and asks what calls might be helpful.</p>
        <p>''The key to this is that Congress doesn't vote on all the issues at once, so you get a manageable variety of issues coming up,'' Mr. Grainger explained. ''You need to know about them just beforehand, in the time frame when you can have some input.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Grainger said that the calls take most of Friday, while consolidating the information and writing the flier takes most of Saturday. ''Sunday is the day for the mechanical part - cutting the stencil, printing the fliers, putting on labels, sorting for bulk mailing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grainger began by mailing fliers free each week to 288 people whose names were on a mailing list of a group formed to oppose United States aid to the contras in Nicaragua. ''In lieu of an advertising campaign, I tried to get it going by just doing it,'' he said. Soon other people expressed interest in receiving ''Of, By and For the People.'' The fifth issue, which urged calls against sales of assault weapons and ''U.S. money to buy the Nicaraguan election,'' was mailed to 487 people on Oct. 17.  The Last Free Flier</p>
        <p>That flier was the last free one. Mr. Grainger is seeking subscribers who will pay $4 a month for ''Of, By and For the People.'' A man with a sense of humor as well as a mission, he noted that four people offered to pay ''without even being asked.'' And, he said, ''Half of them I didn't know.''</p>
        <p>Putting out the first five issues cost Mr. Grainger more than $500. Now, he says, ''I want to be able to pay myself a wage.'' His plans - what he calls ''delusions of Grainger'' - also call for a team of workers to produce fliers for all 50 states. But if he does not have 300 subscribers by Thanksgiving, Mr. Grainger says the flier ''won't continue to exist.''</p>
        <p>''It's supposed to be government of the people, by the people and for the people, but there isn't a real mechanism for that to happen on a day-by-day, week-by-week, issue-by-issue basis,'' he said. ''This can be a way to do that. This is what I want to continue with.''</p>
