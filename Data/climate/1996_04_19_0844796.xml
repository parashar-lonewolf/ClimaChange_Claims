        <p>You couldn't make these guys up -- the exterminator, the undertaker and the big-game hunter who are leading the charge by House Republicans to trample the nation's environmental laws.</p>
        <p>Free-associate on these fellows and "life-affirming" is the last term that comes to mind.</p>
        <p>The exterminator is Tom DeLay, the majority whip, from Sugar Land, Tex. A profile of him in The Wall Street Journal began, "Rep. Tom DeLay once made his living killing roaches. Now he kills regulations."</p>
        <p>Mr. DeLay is the enforcer and chief fund-raiser in the G.O.P.'s legislative assault on environmental and other safeguards. He has never met a regulation he  could abide. To him, the Environmental Protection Agency is the "Gestapo of the  Government."</p>
        <p>Mr. DeLay sold his extermination business, but his hypersensitivity to certain issues, shaped by his immersion in the peculiarities of pest control, has remained intact. He is driven to a near-frenzy by government bans on pesticides and other dangerous chemicals. The return of DDT, banned since the early 70's, would be A-O.K. with Tom DeLay. He doesn't think DDT is harmful. Chlorofluorocarbons? No problem. If you're worried about the ozone layer, slap on a little more sunscreen.</p>
        <p>Mr. DeLay is pushing a proposal to repeal all of the ozone protection in the  Clean Air Act. When the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to the discoverers  of the link between chlorofluorocarbons and ozone depletion, Mr. DeLay mocked the award as the "Nobel Appeasement Prize."</p>
        <p>The undertaker is Thomas J. Bliley Jr. of Richmond, Va. Mr. Bliley, chairman  of the Commerce Committee, ran his family's funeral home business until he was elected to the House in 1980.</p>
        <p>A close ally of Mr. DeLay, Mr. Bliley has drafted legislation that would weaken both the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act. Philip Clapp, executive director of the Environmental Information Center in Washington, described the legislation as "a wish list for  the entire pesticide industry."</p>
        <p>The bill would replace the existing health-based standard for pesticides in food with a cost-benefit standard. Among other things, it would make it much easier to bring pesticides to market, and much more difficult for the E.P.A. to  challenge a pesticide as dangerous.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bliley, who is nothing if not brazen, has titled his legislation the "Food Quality Protection Act."</p>
        <p>Now, with your food you sometimes want a little water. Mr. Bliley is taking care of that, too. He is hard at work on legislation that would undermine the Safe Drinking Water Act by easing the pollution monitoring requirements on water systems that serve 90 percent of the nation's population.</p>
        <p>The legislation would make it much more difficult to get at every kind of filth that is contaminating the water supply. Mr. Bliley and his powerful corporate backers (he has been the number one House recipient of contributions from the pesticide industry for the past three years) think that is terrific. Fecal matter and disease-carrying microbes? Cancer-causing chemicals? Arsenic? Lead? Don't worry about it. If the water supply becomes too foul, consumers can  always buy bottled water.</p>
        <p>The trophy-collecting big-game hunter (and former trapper) is Representative  Don Young of Fort Yukon, Alaska, chairman of the Committee on Resources. With the heads of past kills mounted proudly on his office walls, Mr. Young set about crafting legislation that ultimately would cripple the Endangered Species Act. The result was the Young-Pombo bill, written with Richard Pombo, Republican of California.</p>
        <p>The bill would abandon the fundamental objective of the act, which is to help endangered species recover to the point where they no longer need protection. But under Young-Pombo, some species would be allowed to go extinct in the wild (grizzly bears, gray wolves and certain species of salmon, for example) if a few of them were kept alive in zoos or on fish farms.</p>
        <p>And many species would certainly become extinct because Young-Pombo would no  longer require the protection of critical habitats. Example: It would not be considered harmful to the bald eagle if you cut down its nesting tree while the  eagle was in flight.</p>
        <p>The exterminator, the undertaker, the big-game hunter. Scary, isn't it?</p>
