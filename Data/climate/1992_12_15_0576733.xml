        <p>A QUARTER billion years ago, something so terrible happened on earth that up to 96 percent of plant and animal species were wiped out. The cause of this greatest of all global catastrophes remains unknown, but evidence is mounting that the main culprit was a monstrous volcanic eruption that covered much of Siberia with molten rock, touching off an ice age and a worldwide deluge of lethal acid rain.</p>
        <p>This mass extinction, which occurred at the end of the Permian period, was the subject of papers presented last week at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union and in the journal Science.</p>
        <p>The devastating Permian catastrophe swept the earth clean of animal groups from trilobites in the ocean to ferocious reptile carnivores living on land. The "great dying," as some scientists call it, radically changed the history of life on the planet. It ushered most species into oblivion but opened ecological niches for a host of others, including the dinosaurs of the Mesozoic era that followed.</p>
        <p>Like the other episodes of mass extinction discovered in the fossil record, the deadly wave of Permian extinctions has excited endless speculation as to what caused it. But few hard facts have turned up. One reason is that it occurred so long ago that many possible clues have been obliterated by geological processes.</p>
        <p>Even the causes of much more recent extinctions, including the event that ended the Cretaceous period 65 million years ago and wiped out the dinosaurs, remain uncertain and disputed because of ambiguities and gaps in the fossil and geologic records. The Permian extinction, nearly four times as old as the Cretaceous extinction, is all the harder to decipher.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, an important new clue has emerged to what may have been a major or even principal cause of the Permian extinction. It has come from study of a geological formation called the Siberian Traps, an expanse of volcanic rock some 870 miles in diameter that borders Lake Baikal. Floods of volcanic basalt often have a terraced appearance, and the geological term "trap" is derived from the Swedish word for "stairs."</p>
        <p>Although the ages of the vast Siberian lava field and the Permian mass extinction were apparently similar, convincing evidence was lacking that these ages actually coincided.</p>
        <p>An international group of scientists has now found that the eruptions that created the flood of molten basalt in the Siberian Traps occurred in something less than 600,000 years, beginning 248 million years ago. Their study also showed that the Siberian eruptions were probably violent enough to blast immense amounts of dust and aerosol droplets into the upper atmosphere, where they could have blocked sunlight for a long time, thereby drastically cooling the earth and causing polar ice caps to grow at the expense of the seas' liquid water.</p>
        <p>There seem to have been rapid and large fluctuations in global sea levels during this period, they reported, which would have drastically upset habitats, especially of many marine organisms. Such a situation could explain why the Permian extinctions were much more severe for marine animals than land animals. New Evidence Disclosed</p>
        <p>The scientists have found, moreover, that the volcanic blasts that created the Siberian Traps would have converted immense quantities of sulfate minerals into sulfur dioxide gas and sulfuric acid likely to fall back to earth in the form of acid rain. This, coupled with climatic changes or the loss of habitats, could have snuffed out many species.</p>
        <p>The new evidence was reported last week by Dr. Gerald K. Czamanske of the United States Geological Survey at Menlo Park, Calif., in the journal Science, and in a talk he gave at the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>Dr. Czamanske, with two Australian colleagues, Dr. Ian H. Campbell and Dr. Robert I. Hill of Australian National University in Canberra, and two Russian scientists, Dr. Valerie A. Fedorenko and Dr. Valentin Stepanov of the Central Research Institute of Geological Prospecting for Base and Precious Metals in Moscow, used an ultrasensitive and carefully calibrated dating technique to gauge the ages of ancient minerals. They did this by measuring the extent to which uranium and thorium in the minerals had been transformed by radioactive decay to various forms of lead.</p>
        <p>Some scientists, including Dr. Dewey M. McLean of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, and Dr. Charles B. Officer and Dr. Charles L. Drake of Dartmouth College, have long theorized that vast upwellings of volcanic basalt at various periods in the past caused major mass extinctions.</p>
        <p>In 1988 Dr. Michael R. Rampino and Dr. Richard B. Stothers of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center said in an article in Science that 9 of the 10 greatest mass extinction events of all time more or less coincided with continental floods of volcanic basalt in various parts of the world, and that these extinctions might have been caused by volcanism.</p>
        <p>The most famous mass extinction, generally ranked about fifth in overall severity, was the Cretaceous event, the catastrophe that exterminated the dinosaurs. This occurred about the time of a huge eruption in what is now India, a great lava flood that created a formation called the Deccan Traps. But at about the same time, many geologists believe, one or more asteroids or comets struck Earth.</p>
        <p>Some scientists believe that such impacts alone caused the Cretaceous extinction. Others believe the impacts were simply the final blow to Cretaceous animals and plants already weakened by environmental stresses. Another group, including many paleontologists, believes the evidence that extraterrestrial impacts caused mass extinctions is too weak to accept as conclusive.</p>
        <p>A few experts, including Dr. David M. Raup, a paleobiologist at the University of Chicago, have argued in books and scientific papers that all mass extinctions, not only the Cretaceous extinction, probably resulted from the impacts by asteroids or comets, and that these events may occur at periodic intervals. But Dr. Raup said in an interview last week that Dr. Czamanske's volcanic explanation of the Permian extinction was exciting, if it proved to be correct. Source of Impact Theories</p>
        <p>All modern impact theories of extinction have their roots in a 1979 discovery by Dr. Walter Alvarez of the University of California at Berkeley and his colleagues. The researchers discovered a thin layer of iridium-enriched sediment separating sediments laid down during the Cretaceous period, when dinosaurs flourished, from the later Tertiary period, when dinosaurs had entirely disappeared. Iridium, a precious metal belonging to the platinum group of elements, is more abundant in meteorites than in terrestrial rocks, and many experts regard the abnormally high content of iridium in strata laid down at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary as strong evidence of an extraterrestrial impact.</p>
        <p>But no such sharp iridium anomaly has been found in sediments coinciding with any of the other mass extinctions. Moreover, iridium is often found in association with volcanic eruptions, particularly in the Siberian Traps, a region known for its rich ores of platinum-group metals, including iridium. This fact has helped to keep scientific debate bubbling.</p>
        <p>The debate took an unexpected turn at last week's meeting of geophysicists in San Francisco, when Dr. Rampino and a colleague, Dr. Verne Oberbeck of NASA's Ames Research Center, proposed a theory that the Permian extinctions were caused by an asteroid.</p>
        <p>As it approached Earth 250 million years ago, they suggested, the asteroid broke up and bombarded Earth, splitting apart the supercontinent known as Gondwanaland and puncturing Earth's crust to cause Siberia's volcanic eruptions and the great Permian extinction.</p>
        <p>The proposal was met with skepticism by most of the scientists at the meeting, including those who believe that the Cretaceous extinction, the one that killed the dinosaurs, was caused by an impact. Dr. Czamanske, among other critics of Dr. Rampino's hypothesis, said it was unlikely that even a huge asteroid could pack enough energy to cause the vast basaltic upheaval that created the Siberian Traps. Others said the geology of the Permian extinction event lacked the iridium anomaly and other features that tended to support the impact explanation in the case of the Cretaceous extinction.</p>
        <p>"The sediments at the end of the Permian are very different from those at the end of the Cretaceous, and the two events themselves clearly had little in common," Dr. Czamanske said. "For one thing, the Permian extinctions stretched out over a million or more years, while the Cretaceous extinctions seem to have occurred much more rapidly. I think the evidence is strong that an impact by an asteroid did occur at the end of the Cretaceous, but I see no good evidence for an impact at the end of the Permian." An Accidental Discovery</p>
        <p>Dr. Czamanske, a specialist in rock formed from molten minerals, said he hit upon the new evidence of a volcanic cause for the Permian extinctions while he and his Russian colleagues were investigating possible new sources of platinum and other valuable platinum-group metals. The Siberian Traps are at the heart of one the richest platinum-producing regions in the world, and the scientists hoped to find clues that would help in spotting platinum ores in similar geological formations elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Dr. Czamanske believes that volcanic floods like the Siberian and Deccan Traps originate as "perturbations," perhaps related to shifts in the earth's magnetic field, deep inside the Earth, where the mantle is in contact with the core.</p>
        <p>These perturbations are believed to launch thin jets of super-hot molten rock up through the mantle, forming "plumes." As plumes approach the crust and the Earth's surface, they mushroom outward, melting surrounding rock, gathering it up and pulling it to the surface. Huge blobs of magma, some from the plume and some from the mantle through which it passed, eventually reach the surface and send vast floods of lava over the land. A Difficult Task</p>
        <p>Measuring the age of minerals deposited by the Siberian Traps lava flood has proved difficult, but Dr. Czamanske's colleagues isolated tiny zircon gem stones in solidified plume material. The zircons could be dated much more reliably than the lava that brought them to the surface.</p>
        <p>By dating zircons and other minerals, and by measuring such geological benchmarks as reversals in the earth's magnetic polarity, the scientists calculated a date for the Siberian Traps eruptions, 251 million years, that they regard as the most reliable ever determined. It almost perfectly matches the estimated age of the Permian extinction, a match that Dr. Czamanske and many other scientists regard as too close to be a coincidence.</p>
        <p>A similar explanation of the Permian extinctions was proposed in 1991 by Dr. Paul R. Renne of the Institute of Human Origins in Berkeley, Calif., and Asish R. Basu of the University of Rochester. But their dating of the Siberian Traps was questioned as having been based on an erroneous age estimate of the mineral used as a reference standard.</p>
        <p>"In other words," Dr. Czamanske said, "Renne and Basu came up with the right answer, but it was based on an erroneous standard of measurement, and they reached their conclusion by accident."</p>
        <p>However persuasive the various extinction theories may seem, they are all notoriously difficult to prove. In his recent book "Extinction: Bad Genes or Bad Luck?" Dr. Raup wrote: "The disturbing reality is that for none of the thousands of well-documented extinctions in the geologic past do we have a solid explanation of why the extinction occurred."</p>
        <p>Correction:  December 19, 1992, Saturday</p>
        <p>A chart in Science Times on Tuesday about mass extinctions referred incorrectly to the timing of the Final Cretaceous extinction. It coincided with Indian lava eruptions, not Siberian eruptions. A related diagram showed an incorrect point of origin for the Siberian eruptions. The lava came from the boundary of earth's outer core and mantle.</p>
