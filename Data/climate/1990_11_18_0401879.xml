        <p>Mr. Twomey's article is illustrative of the shallowness of much of what passes as debate on the Shoreham issue.</p>
        <p>The events in the Persian Gulf should by now have made it abundantly clear that replacing a modern, operational nuclear plant with oil-burning power plants serves only to make us increasingly hostage to foreign oil. Mr. Twomey disposes of that problem without batting an eyelash. "But Lilco's oil doesn't come from Arab nations," he chortles. "The vast majority of it comes from Venezuela."</p>
        <p>So Long Islanders needn't lose any sleep over those silly Middle East crises that plague the rest of the world! Venezuelan oil, of course, is just as expensive and subject to the same supply and demand pressures as Arab oil.</p>
        <p>The ideal solution, says Twomey, is to convert Shoreham to natural gas, which "does not create acid rain, and adds very little to the greenhouse effect." It comes as a great relief to us in the scientific community to learn that burning natural gas or other carbon fuels no longer contributes to the greenhouse effect or produces acidic substances. Apparently, the Long Island Power Authority can repeal the laws of physics and chemistry as easily as it stands economics on its head.</p>
        <p>But then almost anything is possible for these creative accountants, who proved that you save money by throwing away a $5 billion plant.  ANTHONY S. FILANDRO  Vice President, Research and Development  Virginia Dare Extract Company  Baldwin</p>
