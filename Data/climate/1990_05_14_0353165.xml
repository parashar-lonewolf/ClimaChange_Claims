        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In a May 2 news article, Budget Director Richard G. Darman is quoted as saying that ''Americans did not fight and win the wars of the 20th century to make the world safe for green vegetables.'' And to this we might add: nor for global warming and other environmental problems that Mr. Darman seems to perceive as just so many excuses for more environmental regulation with its consequent undermining of America's economy, standard of living and entrepreneurial risk-taking.</p>
        <p>Still, for a country like the United States that has managed to send men to the moon, position a universe-peering telescope into space, among many other notable technological accomplishments, it is ironic that a prominent member of its Government should see it as threatened by having to recognize and deal with environmental issues. Thankfully, some of these, like our mounting municipal waste disposal problem, have been tackled and at least partially resolved by the creation of solid waste recycling programs originally launched not by government action, but by volunteer citizen initiative.</p>
        <p>And this initiative has eventually led to the creation of newspaper recycling plants, the useful reclamation of discarded glass containers and metal cans as well as the saving of energy by the aluminum can manufacturing industry. Thus, all in all, a beneficial impact on our economy and a stimulus rather than a slowdown in our risk-taking momentum.</p>
        <p>To be sure, more needs to be done to come to terms with damaging assaults on the environment like urban sprawl, the release of toxic gases into the atmosphere, acid rain, waste dumping in our oceans and waterways, and noise pollution, to mention but a few.</p>
        <p>These adverse environmental impacts will require large-scale corrective action at the private, corporate and government levels. But to be effective at this latter stage, this action will need to require more than a defensive stance and sarcastic rhetoric of which Mr. Darman has given us a regrettable and very sorry example.</p>
