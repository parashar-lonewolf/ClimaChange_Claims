        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Warm, Warmer, Warmest,'' by Nicholas D. Kristof (column, March 5): Climate scientists largely agree that global warming is imminent or already here, and that we can look only to minimize its effects. The question is not, ''Are we an intelligent species?'' It is, ''Do we have the will to act?''</p>
        <p>We have to adopt tough strategies and sustain them through decades that overlap with multiple administrations, Congresses and changes in the political party in control.</p>
        <p>Our history has been one of repeated failure to sustain energy strategies. Mr. Kristof is right that we need to use everything to minimize the emission of greenhouse gases, from conservation and tax policy to nuclear, wind and solar power. But the tough job will be to adopt them when they may cost a few pennies more than burning oil, gas and coal.</p>
        <p>For that we need true leadership across party lines, a commodity even more scarce than pollution-free energy.</p>
        <p>William H. Miller  Columbia, Mo., March 5, 2006</p>
        <p>The writer is a professor at the Nuclear Science and Energy Institute, University of Missouri.</p>
