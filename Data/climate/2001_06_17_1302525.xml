        <p>AT a news conference in Madrid last week, a puzzled journalist's question to President Bush expressed, with mathematical concision, the growing suspicion in the scientific community that it carries no more weight with the administration than do the American League baseball standings with the average Basque:</p>

        <p>AT a news conference in Madrid last week, a puzzled journalist's question to President Bush expressed, with mathematical concision, the growing suspicion in the scientific community that it carries no more weight with the administration than do the American League baseball standings with the average Basque:</p>
        <p>''You say the scientific evidence isn't strong enough to go forward with Kyoto. So then how do you justify your missile defense plan when there is even less scientific evidence that that will work?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush avoided answering the question directly. But some scientists argue that the president and his top officials, including Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, are trying to have it both ways. On the one hand, they cite the lack of conclusive research on climate change to argue against the Kyoto accord on global warming. At the same time, they are eager to push ahead with the development of a national missile defense despite even greater scientific uncertainties.</p>
        <p>This sort of reasoning has led many scientists in the United States to conclude that the current administration is uninterested in scientific research or its conclusions.</p>
        <p>That scientists are sometimes ignored by politicians is nothing new. But Dr. Hugh Gusterson, a cultural anthropologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who studies American science and the federal laboratories, said he believed there is a particular problem with the Bush presidency, in that most major scientists today, whatever their politics, are unwilling to accept White House policies.</p>
        <p>''Usually Republicans have their scientists and Democrats have their scientists,'' said Dr. Gusterson.  ''What's extraordinary about this moment in time, on both missile defense and the greenhouse effect, is the substantial consensus against the White House policy.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, some experts believe that science's influence in public policy matters has not been at such a low ebb since before World War I.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has not yet appointed a national science adviser or filled other top science positions in agencies like the National Institutes of Health and the Environmental Protection Agency. And with the exception of health and defense, which have fared well, the administration's proposed 2002 budget includes sharp cuts in real spending for most research funding agencies.</p>
        <p>''The major thing that's happening is that a science adviser, or science and technology adviser, to the president has not yet been named,'' said Dr. D. Allan Bromley, the Yale physicist, the science adviser for President Bush's father, who has criticized the current administration for its tepid financial support of science. Dr. Gusterson pointed out that President Ronald Reagan had no trouble plucking a simpatico science adviser, Dr. George A. Keyworth II, out of Los Alamos National Laboratory.</p>
        <p>Previous administrations, however, have sometimes been slow to fill scientific posts, and Dr. Bromley pointed out that Mr. Bush's prolonged election count left him with less time than others to make his appointments. Dr. Bromley also said that in his view, the Kyoto accord contained flaws unrelated to climate science that fully justified its rejection.</p>
        <p>But others see a more fundamental difference between this administration and its predecessors. ''My own impression is we've entered a new era,'' said Dr. David C. Cassidy, a science historian at Hofstra University. ''Physicists in particular have lost a lot of clout, and they've even lost a lot of esteem in the public eye, and I think that's reflected in the fact that they're now being more ignored in their advice.''</p>
        <p>UNHAPPILY out in the cold, scientists are asking, among other things, whether it is just a coincidence that their current marginal status in the policy arena coincides with the fact that there is no grand, moral figure among their ranks, no Albert Einstein or Andrei Sakharov to whom politicians would have to pay attention. And they question whether it isn't the scientific community itself, having arrogantly dismissed scientist-popularizers like the astronomer Carl Sagan or the biologist Stephen Jay Gould, that has discouraged others from aspiring to public visibility and influence.</p>
        <p>Science historians point out, too, that research in general has become a vastly more cooperative enterprise in recent decades, with teams of hundreds of scientists working on the genome project and particle physics experiments, leaving no hero alone in the spotlight.</p>
        <p>It was not always so. Perhaps the single most influential bit of scientific advice to a politician came when Einstein wrote to President Franklin D. Roosevelt on Aug. 2, 1939, warning him that Germany might be working on an atomic bomb and urging that the United States undertake a similar project.</p>
        <p>Offical science committees also played major roles in President Dwight D. Eisenhower's development of intercontinental ballistic missiles and President Richard M. Nixon's decision to cease work on germ weapons.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Paul Forman, curator of the modern physics collection at the National Museum of American History in Washington, says that scientists, like politicians, live in a culture that has grown suspicious of public figures, especially those who come with high reputations or are allied to prestigious institutions. Even if they were here today, Mr. Forman said, Einstein, Sakharov or Richard Feynman (who in 1986 interrupted the staid choreography of a Congressional hearing by showing, with a glass of ice water, how an O-ring could have failed and caused the Challenger space shuttle disaster) would not have the authority they once had.</p>
        <p>The demotion of science in political circles is not unprecedented -- witness the elimination of the Office of Technology Assessment, which advised Congress on scientific and technical issues, during the Gingrich revolution of the mid-1990's. And that was just one highly visible point on a long downward arc from an intoxicating height achieved during the world wars and the cold war, said Dr. Spencer Weart, director of the Center for the History of Physics at the American Institute of Physics.</p>
        <p>''As they say, radar won the war and the atomic bomb ended it,'' Dr. Weart said. ''Physicists of the time told me they were regarded with almost supernatural awe. They were the masters of time and space.''</p>
        <p>Since then, said Dr. Weart, as science has become more abstract, it has grown harder to understand and easier to ignore. But he noted that around the world, as governments grapple with global warming, the ozone hole, declining fisheries and public health problems from foot and mouth to AIDS, there is ever greater reliance on scientific advice.</p>
        <p>''The issues nowadays are unbelievably pluralistic,'' said Dr. Daniel Kevles, a science historian and professor at Yale. ''There's hardly an issue you can think of that doesn't turn to some extent on technical knowledge.''</p>
        <p>This fact may, over time, turn science itself into a kind of advocacy group. Already in the United States, scientists have helped build support for particular issues -- AIDS research, for example. And scientists are learning how to organize in their self-interest through groups like the Federation of American Scientists and the Union of Concerned Scientists. An e-mail sent out last week by George H. Trilling, president of the American Physical Society, included a sample ''Dear Congressman'' letter to help members agitate for more science funding.</p>
        <p>SCIENTISTS are also coming to the realization that, once a scientific matter becomes a public issue -- whether having to do with missiles or birth control or Earth's climate -- how a position is presented and argued may well outweigh pure research.</p>
        <p>''In an area like climate change, the science at this point is only going to tell you so much,'' said Dr. Robert J. Lempert, a senior scientist and expert in risk analysis at the Rand Corporation. ''And then the question is, how do you deal with risk which is inevitably going to be there. Science is only part of the story.''</p>
