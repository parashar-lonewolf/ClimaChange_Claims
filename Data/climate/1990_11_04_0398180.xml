        <p>President Bush, on a final pre-election campaign swing to help Republicans, reiterated today that he would sign the recently passed legislation strengthening the Clean Air Act but voiced opposition to a sweeping California ballot proposition, known as "Big Green," that would severely curb use of pesticides and chemicals.</p>
        <p>"When it comes to the environment, in order to keep our environment green, we don't have to be Big Green," the President said in a campaign speech for Senator Pete Wilson, the Republican nominee for governor.</p>

        <p>President Bush, on a final pre-election campaign swing to help Republicans, reiterated today that he would sign the recently passed legislation strengthening the Clean Air Act but voiced opposition to a sweeping California ballot proposition, known as "Big Green," that would severely curb use of pesticides and chemicals.</p>
        <p>"When it comes to the environment, in order to keep our environment green, we don't have to be Big Green," the President said in a campaign speech for Senator Pete Wilson, the Republican nominee for governor.</p>
        <p>The ballot proposition, supported widely by environmental organizations, would phase out cancer-causing pesticides, ban ozone-depleting chemicals and reduce gaseous emissions that contribute to global warming, among other provisions.</p>
        <p>The measure is opposed by water, timber, agricultural and manufacturing industries.</p>
        <p>After the President spoke today, his Administration's leading environmental official, William K. Reilly, said he did not have a public position on Big Green. He told reporters that it had some laudable provisions, but he also cited its costs and said, "It is not sound scientifically."</p>
        <p>From here, Mr. Bush headed to New Mexico to stump for that state's Repubican gubernatorial nominee, Frank Bond, and other candidates.</p>
