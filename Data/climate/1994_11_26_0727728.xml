        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The indictment of policies to save energy by Herbert Inhaber and Harry Saunders (Op-Ed, Nov. 20) is at once defeatist and deficient.</p>
        <p>In focusing on energy consumption in the United States, the authors overlook the health, economic and environmental consequences of energy inefficiency worldwide. As economies grow, they consume more energy. Inefficient consumption of fossil fuels generates greenhouse gases and other contaminants that impair the function of human and natural systems.</p>
        <p>We invite the authors to visit rapidly developing regions of the world like Liaoning Province in China, where energy-profligate industrial policies are choking urban residents in coal soot, sulfur dioxide and other pollutants.</p>
        <p>In a country like China, inefficient exploitation of fossil fuels has profound adverse health, economic and ecological impacts, including higher incidence of respiratory illnesses (resulting in lost workdays), acidified lakes (with economic losses to fishing) and toxification of agricultural soils (affecting the quantity and quality of grain harvest).</p>
        <p>The closing remarks of the authors about the value of energy conservation seem more myopic. They argue that energy efficiency policies are useful, not because they save energy, but because they "stimulate increased economic activity."</p>
        <p>Generally, increased economic activity warrants increased energy consumption. We contend that accelerated economic development is beneficial only if it is accompanied by technologies and practices that assure sustainable energy use.</p>
        <p>The interdependencies between energy and environment, health and economic welfare leave society no choice but to promote energy efficiency.  MATTHEW AUER  XIAOLAN YE  New Haven, Nov. 21, 1994  The writers, graduate students at Yale and Nanjing universities, respectively, are collaborating on an energy audit of their schools.</p>
