        <p>Editorial welcomes news that General Motors and DaimlerChrysler are dropping their lawsuits against California rule requiring automakers to produce millions of cleaner, more efficient 'hybrid' vehicles over next 15 years; says other states, like New York, often follow California's lead in such matters, meaning hybrids could in time be available everywhere</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>At a time when neither Congress nor the administration seems interested in significantly improving automobile efficiency, California has kept up the good fight and has now won an important victory. The Times's Danny Hakim reported this week that General Motors and DaimlerChrysler had agreed to drop their lawsuits against a California rule requiring automakers to produce millions of cleaner, more efficient ''hybrid'' vehicles -- cars powered by a combination of gasoline and electricity -- over the next 15 years. Since other states, like New York, often follow California's lead in these matters, such vehicles may in time be available everywhere. This, in turn, could lead to progress not only on cleaner air but also on global warming and the nation's growing dependence on foreign oil.</p>
        <p>At issue was California's 1990 zero-emission rule, which decreed that 10 percent of all vehicles sold in the state from 2003 to 2008 be pollution-free. That essentially meant electric cars, but since these have turned out to be a commercial dead end, California wisely extended the deadline and invited the industry to meet part of its quota with hybrids. The industry, which hates quotas, went to court, arguing that the rule was merely a backdoor way of setting new fuel economy standards, a federal prerogative. California retorted that it was interested only in reducing air pollution and that improved mileage would be a serendipitous byproduct.</p>

        <p>At a time when neither Congress nor the administration seems interested in significantly improving automobile efficiency, California has kept up the good fight and has now won an important victory. The Times's Danny Hakim reported this week that General Motors and DaimlerChrysler had agreed to drop their lawsuits against a California rule requiring automakers to produce millions of cleaner, more efficient ''hybrid'' vehicles -- cars powered by a combination of gasoline and electricity -- over the next 15 years. Since other states, like New York, often follow California's lead in these matters, such vehicles may in time be available everywhere. This, in turn, could lead to progress not only on cleaner air but also on global warming and the nation's growing dependence on foreign oil.</p>
        <p>At issue was California's 1990 zero-emission rule, which decreed that 10 percent of all vehicles sold in the state from 2003 to 2008 be pollution-free. That essentially meant electric cars, but since these have turned out to be a commercial dead end, California wisely extended the deadline and invited the industry to meet part of its quota with hybrids. The industry, which hates quotas, went to court, arguing that the rule was merely a backdoor way of setting new fuel economy standards, a federal prerogative. California retorted that it was interested only in reducing air pollution and that improved mileage would be a serendipitous byproduct.</p>
        <p>The manufacturers apparently decided that California would get the better of the argument in court. The state has also agreed to regulatory changes that will allow the companies to make even fewer zero-emission cars and more hybrids. To meet its zero-emission mandate over the long term, the industry will now devote an increasing share of its investments to hydrogen-powered fuel-cell cars.</p>
        <p>The settlement could not have come at a better time. In the 2002 model year, the fuel economy of the average new American passenger vehicle reached a 22-year low, largely because of the increasing popularity of S.U.V.'s and other so-called light trucks. And while California says that its main objective is to obtain cleaner cars that emit fewer smog-forming pollutants, it is also true that hybrids tend to go farther on a gallon of gas than conventional cars and thus emit less carbon dioxide, a big factor in global warming. For the same reason, they also require fewer barrels of imported oil.</p>
        <p>Efforts in Congress to jump-start the production of hybrids by mandating increases in fuel economy have gone nowhere. California, often on the leading edge of environmental issues, may have found a way to accomplish what Congress has not.</p>
