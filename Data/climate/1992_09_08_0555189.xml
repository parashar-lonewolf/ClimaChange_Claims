        <p>Companies</p>
        <p>Merck's decision to market lower-priced generic versions of its products signals that even the most powerful drug companies cannot ignore the possibility of sharp drops in revenue when important drugs lose patent protection. Merck is creating a generic drug division, West Point Pharma, that will market a lower-priced exact copy of Dolobid, an analgesic.  [ Page D1. ]</p>
        <p>GPA Group has faced a potential crisis ever since its planned initial stock offering flopped in June. With no easy solution in sight, GPA's chairman and founder, Tony Ryan, will again take over as chief executive, but he still faces a difficult fight to bring the company's finances under control and maintain its position as one of the aerospace industry's most influential companies.

        <p>In its yearlong struggle to recover from the Treasury bidding scandal, Salomon Brothers swept almost every senior executive from office, built a management team with virtual unknowns, settled charges with $290 million in fines and regained profitability. Now, to steady its bottom line, Salomon hopes to build profitable investment-banking and equities businesses.  [ D1. ]</p>
        <p>The investment group that agreed to acquire a large stake in DWG from the financier Victor Posner says it has no plans to sell the company's diverse businesses.  [ D6. ] The Economy</p>
        <p>New windmills are ready to take their place as an economical and important source of the nation's energy. Because of striking improvements in technology, the commercial use of these wind turbines has shown that in addition to being pollution free, they can compete with fossil fuels in the cost of producing electricity.  [ D1. ]</p>
        <p>Hurricane Andrew damaged $1 billion worth of crops, foliage plants and towering palms. South Florida's nursery operators, fruit growers and farmers have little hope of saving what is left.  [ A1. ]</p>
        <p>Consumer advocates sought to head off any effort by insurers to raise rates by using Hurricane Andrew as justification. An American International Group executive had described the storm in a memo as "an opportunity to get price increases."  [ D4. ] International</p>
        <p>A former East German company has produced a refrigerator that it says will be free of ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons. But DKK Scharfenstein is teetering on the brink of extinction, showing that even a company working on a product the world is clamoring for is not guaranteed survival in free markets.  [ D4. ]</p>
        <p>Toyota introduced its first totally American-made import for sale in Japan. The Scepter station wagon, which is known as the Camry wagon in the U.S., is built in Georgetown, Ky.  [ D7. ]</p>
        <p>French supporters of the Maastricht treaty have been cheered by a swing in their favor, but the outcome of the vote remains uncertain because of a backlash against the European unity treaty among France's grass-roots voters.  [ A12. ] Markets</p>
        <p>Germany's weekend pledge to keep interest rates steady helped to calm Europe's jangled markets. The announcement appeared to signal an end to the rising German rates that have stifled economic recovery in other European nations.  [ D1. ]  Today's Columns</p>
        <p>What to call these hard times? What has been happening to America since 1989 seems momentous enough to enter history as a major economic event of the 20th century. But none of the words and phrases that described hardship in the past seem adequate today. Louis Uchitelle: Business Scene.  [ D2. ]</p>
        <p>Geneva Steel made a name for itself as the only integrated steel mill west of the Mississippi, and as a company that remained profitable during much of the recession. Now that profitability has come to a crashing end. Market Place.  [ D8. ]</p>
        <p>Did AC&amp;R Advertising hire Paul Cappelli to provide a next generation of leadership, or was it to spur provocative debate on pressing industry issues? Stuart Elliott: Advertising.  [ D10. ]</p>
