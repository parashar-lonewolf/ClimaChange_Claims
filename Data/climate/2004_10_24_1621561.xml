        <p>By 2008, there will be about 40 wind turbines in the ocean south of Long Island, generating more than 140 megawatts of electricity in a strong wind -- enough to power 140,000 Long Island homes. But if you go down to the beach to look at them, you will probably be disappointed. If you can see them at all, they will look like matchsticks on the horizon.</p>
        <p>The Long Island Power Authority, burned by local resistance to its earlier proposal to place three wind turbines at Camp Hero on Montauk Point, has done its best to make these three-bladed turbines invisible by placing them far out at sea. While LIPA is right to be sensitive to popular concerns (not something power authorities are known for), it has gone overboard in planning to place them so far offshore.</p>
        <p>The power authority has recently chosen FPL Energy of Juno Beach, Fla., to build the offshore wind farm. This followed a two-year study by several consultants to choose the best site, taking into consideration water depth, bird activity, transmission access, but most of all ''visual impacts.'' LIPA has chosen a site more than three miles offshore, midway between Jones Beach and Robert Moses State Park. The turbines will be placed about one-third of a mile to half a mile apart and stand about 425 feet above the water, higher than the Statue of Liberty. According to FPL, the project will cost more than $300 million; the company plans to recover its costs through the wholesale rates it will charge the authority.</p>
        <p>To avoid repeating the Montauk failure, the Long Island Power Authority has done its best to minimize the visual impact of the wind turbines. FPL has supported the authority's decision, arguing that the winds are stronger further offshore. But with only two offshore weather stations, little is known with precision about the pattern of winds south of Long Island.</p>
        <p>While it is more cost effective to build wind farms on shore, it is understandable why LIPA wants to build offshore now. According to its siting assessment, ''The lack of opportunities for land-based wind development due to competing land uses means that offshore areas of Long Island hold the only real promise for adding significant amounts of wind-based electricity generation to the island's energy mix.''</p>
        <p>The present plan, however, places the wind turbines too far offshore. Bringing them a little closer to land has many advantages. In shallower water, the towers and the cable that carry the power back to shore would be shorter, which would make the wind farm less expensive to build. (Indeed, FPL Energy has said that the turbines would be twice as expensive to build offshore as on land.)The project would be farther removed from the shipping lanes approaching New York Harbor. Construction noise would be less likely to disturb migrating whales. Commercial fishermen would be happier, since the proposed site is where they often drag their nets.</p>
        <p>Is there a disadvantage? The main objection to placing the wind turbines closer to shore is that people will be able to see them. But this is no reason not to harness the most promising source of renewable energy -- particularly in light of the state's goal of having renewable resources provide 25 percent of the state's power by 2013. This is doubly important on Long Island, where power is in short supply.</p>
        <p>There seems to be no way to enjoy the benefits of electricity without some adverse effects. Nuclear power produces high-level radioactivity for hundreds of thousands of years. Coal-burning plants bring us acid rain and ozone pollution. Oil-burning plants keep us dependent on the Middle East for oil. Fossil-fueled plants in general, even those burning natural gas, emit carbon dioxide, which worsens global warming. Wind turbines avoid all these problems, but the plain fact remains: you can see them.</p>
        <p>If Long Island and the rest of the United States are to get serious about reducing fossil-fuel use, we will have to get used to looking at wind turbines -- and not just offshore. Ninety-nine percent of the wind turbines in the world are on land. In Fenner, N.Y., southeast of Syracuse, there is a wind farm that can generate 30 megawatts of electricity. The 20 turbines are spread over nearly two square miles of farmers' fields, but they occupy less than 2 percent of the land. Those turbines generate more than 30 megawatts of energy.</p>
        <p>For an idea of what Long Island would look like if wind power developed here, consider Europe. For Long Island to generate as much wind power per square mile of land as Spain does now, it would only need one wind farm on land the size of that at Fenner. If we generated as much as Holland, we would have two such wind farms. If as much as Germany, four. And if as much as Denmark, seven. Within the next quarter-century, as wind turbines sprout up across the United States, it will seem quaint that Long Island once tried to place them out of sight.</p>
        <p>To decide how far the Long Island Power Authority's wind farm should be placed offshore, FPL should provide an economic analysis that also takes into account environmental effects. The turbines should not be placed needlessly in the far distance on the basis of dubious data about offshore winds or concerns about the views by waterfront elites. They should be put where they will be most efficient and less costly.</p>
        <p>And what's wrong with how they look? I think they're elegant.</p>
