        <p>LEAD: THE POLITICIAN HAD JUST DESCRIBED HOW the new master plan to cleanse the grimy air over metropolitan Los Angeles imperils industry. Now he started on what he called its invasions of everyday life - restrictions on housepaint, deodorant, barbecue starter fluid and products in everyone's kitchen that allegedly expel more pollutants than oil refineries.</p>
        <p>THE POLITICIAN HAD JUST DESCRIBED HOW the new master plan to cleanse the grimy air over metropolitan Los Angeles imperils industry. Now he started on what he called its invasions of everyday life - restrictions on housepaint, deodorant, barbecue starter fluid and products in everyone's kitchen that allegedly expel more pollutants than oil refineries. Dry cleaners, too. And now even the delectable aromas wafting from bakeries, because they're actually ethanol, an organic pollutant.</p>
        <p>''That's how extreme they're getting,'' said the politician. ''To me, the smell of fresh baked bread sanitizes the air!''</p>
        <p>He swiveled in his chair. ''Look,'' he added, ''if I killed you, I'd be cleaning the environment, because they chop down trees so you can write. But it's a trade-off: some carbon dioxide in exchange for your right to life, liberty, pursuit of happiness, and our right to public information.''</p>
        <p>The 20-year strategy that California's South Coast Air Quality Management District (or ''A.Q.M.D.,'' as it is called locally) estimates will cost upward of $3 billion annually has numerous detractors, who think it will cost much more and who use the term draconian to describe what others in Los Angeles are calling visionary and desperately overdue. ''The plan'' - as the nearly three-foot high, 45-volume collection of documents is known - will affect citizens' fundamental decisions regarding where they live and how they travel.</p>
        <p>The plan addresses emission sources as varied as printer's ink, computer chips, drive-up windows, pleasure boats and swimming pool heaters. It especially confronts that L.A. icon, the pestilent, single-passenger automobile: already larger companies are required to implement elaborate ride-sharing arrangements, and within a decade they must insure that most cars in their fleets - including rent-a-cars - are low-emitting, alternate-fuel models or electric vehicles, none of which are yet available commercially. Next month, the plan goes to the state Air Resources Board for approval - for the second time, because at the first hearing in June, business and local government representatives managed to drown out supporters with their objections.</p>
        <p>The controversy has grown so acute that when the plan's proponents are asked what makes them dream that 14 million people - who speak 85 languages, partition themselves into 168 separate cities, drive nearly 100 million vehicle-miles per day, live in a state that consumes more gasoline than anywhere save the rest of the United States and all of Russia, and buy and sell in what is roughly the sixth largest economy in the world - would ever cooperate in any scheme that smacks of self-sacrifice for the common good, they resort to invoking the sacred civic memory of that last great American love-in: the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.</p>
        <p>Back then, anxious officials had premonitions of viscous L.A. traffic totally congealing, with swarms of tourists groping over unfamiliar, labyrinthine freeways in search of 23 separate Olympic sites. Instead, businesses voluntarily staggered their workdays, employees car-pooled, truckers restricted themselves to essential deliveries and avoided rush hours -and L.A.'s freeways rolled along like rivers. Without the usual morning crush, when excretions from a million idling engines photochemically metamorphose under the growing sunlight into the airborne toxic stew known as smog, the 6,000-foot San Gabriel Mountains suddenly popped into view behind the city. Amazed motorists turned off air-conditioners and rolled down their windows, and athletes forgot predictions of lung-searing, performance-crippling Stage I and II ozone episodes and romped to 94 Olympic records. But just as Angelenos were congratulating themselves, their very success undermined them. By the Olympics' waning days, those unclogged freeways proved too enticing. Traffic began to swell, quickly surpassing its earlier fearful proportions - pushing up smog levels with it.</p>
        <p>Now, this most extravagant of American cities faces a growing perception that it has reached a limit - that it must attend to the nation's dirtiest air before the future overwhelms it, regardless of contentions that to do so is too expensive, too intrusive, or simply impossible. Many believe that the implications - scientific, economic, medical, social, technological and political - of L.A.'s environmental confrontation foreshadow the showdown awaiting the entire world. That raises the question: If, with all its wealth, Los Angeles can't save itself, can anyplace?</p>
        <p>A MONTH AFTER THE OLYMPICS, MARK Abramowitz, a recent University of California at Los Angeles graduate and a frustrated member of an environmental group so impoverished it couldn't afford an attorney, typed a single paragraph on a clean sheet of paper and mailed it to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. It was a suit filed on his own behalf, charging the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency with failing to enforce the Federal Clean Air Act of 1970 in greater Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>A few weeks later, his phone rang. It was the E.P.A. calling to inquire if he might consider an out-of-court settlement. ''I'm a reasonable sort of fella,'' Abramowitz replied. What were his terms? ''Clean air.''</p>
        <p>Eventually, after a few years of reneging and follow-up suits, a three-judge panel ruled in his favor. As a result, Los Angeles is now under a court-ordered mandate to produce a blueprint for complying with E.P.A. guidelines for ozone, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and airborne particles by the year 2007 (it already meets standards for two other regulated contaminants, lead and sulfur dioxide, and will remain in compliance even if President Bush's proposed stricter standards contained in his new clean-air bill pass Congress intact). The alternative is the prospect of losing major Federal assistance for highway construction and sewage treatment - and the prospect of the E.P.A. stepping in to impose truly radical measures like gas rationing or odd-even driving days, and, if necessary, using the National Guard to enforce them.</p>
        <p>Anyone who has flown over L.A.'s basin and seen what resembles a colossal city-state covered with light brown fuzz can attest that the task will be immense. The most obvious target is the free-wheeling, fuel-propelled way of life that Los Angeles made famous. But this is also now the country's largest manufacturing center. Labor-intensive industries like furniture and high-techs like aerospace, already subject to what they consider onerous restrictions, are equally stunned by proposed regulations limiting emissions from coatings, solvent-based wood finishes, cleaning fluids and adhesives.</p>
        <p>At Terra Furniture in the Los Angeles suburb of City of Industry, Gary Stafford runs his hand over the thick glaze on a stack of wooden umbrella poles. Their water-borne finish is all right for outdoor use, but for the fine oak bedroom sets or wall units his workers are spraying in the adjacent room, only a thinner, solvent-based shine - increasingly discouraged under the plan - lets you feel the wood grain. ''Companies are leaving for Mexico,'' claims Stafford, past president of the California Furniture Manufacturers Association. ''We're exporting, not solving pollution.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Los Angeles-based Hughes Aircraft and Lockheed find themselves in an intragovernmental tug of war: Department of Defense contracts for goods like satellites and radar systems specifically call for solvents, or plating substances like chromium, which the E.P.A. and the state Air Resources Board now won't let them use.</p>
        <p>Last year, Long Beach and Los Angeles harbors handled more tonnage than New York and New Jersey combined. The stupendous traffic passing through here to and from Pacific Rim countries brings trucks and ships that burn noxious diesel. Port officials are studying plugging docked ships into berthside electrical outlets to eliminate generator fumes - but that will require more power plants, a major stationary source of air pollution.</p>
        <p>Michael M. Hertel of Southern California Edison, who has been negotiating a schedule for the 70 percent emissions drop that the A.Q.M.D. will require of that utility, observes that even more boggling than what is already here is what will come - ''The combined populations of Chicago and Detroit.'' According to the Southern California Association of Governments (S.C.A.G.), at least four million more will reside in the S.C.A.G. area two decades from now, all using electricity, consuming products, revving up lawn mowers, generating wastes and trying to get to work in an automobile-designed culture that has kept jobs and homes well separated. But S.C.A.G.'s executive director, Mark Pisano, denies allegations that the air-quality plan is a thinly disguised slow-growth policy.</p>
        <p>''Even if we tried keeping people out, two-thirds of that growth will be from natural increases,'' Pisano says. ''We have the planet's most advanced technological society living alongside the third world here. Our studies show it generally takes three generations for third-world immigrants to lower their birth rates.'' By S.C.A.G.'s calculations, the Los Angeles basin will contain 18 million people by 2010.</p>
        <p>All that is superimposed upon topography that in pre-Columbian times was dubbed ''The Valley of Smokes'' because of its sluggish air circulation. In the past, some have suggested drilling holes through the mountains, or installing giant fans atop them to suck the fumes past San Bernardino into the desert. A recent proposal to direct streams of ocean water skyward to induce more rainfall received half-serious attention until alarmed atmospheric scientists brought up acid fog.</p>
        <p>E IGHT MILES EAST OF DOWNTOWN L.A., the San Bernardino Freeway enters the San Gabriel Valley, one of the basin's most notorious catchments of defiled air. Here, in the town of El Monte, in a low-slung, blue-and-white stucco building, is A.Q.M.D. headquarters. James M. Lents, the tall, soft-spoken Tennessean lured away from the directorship of Colorado's air-quality program to guide A.Q.M.D.'s 996 employees in this byzantine effort, has no illusions that a single technological fix exists for L.A. air. ''If we turn the 80 percent reduction needed in today's emissions into per capita figures,'' says Lents, ''it comes to 13 percent per person. We can't do that without touching all aspects of life. But this will be evolution, not revolution - technology will help by developing cleaner versions of today's products. People often won't even realize the difference.''</p>
        <p>Lents, who has a doctorate in physics, traces much of the criticism of the plan to emotional, not necessarily accurate, interpretations by its opponents. Despite protestations to the contrary, for example, only bakeries producing upward of 100,000 pounds of bread per day will be required to confine their fragrance. His call for bringing jobs and housing closer together, he patiently repeats, refers to future development, not reshuffling everything that's already in place. Much of the opposition to the plan actually focuses less on the environment than on what Forbes magazine implied when it wrote that Lents ''may well be the most powerful man in southern California.'' With its burgeoning budget, emissions fees, schedule of fines and enforcement staff, the A.Q.M.D. is beginning to resemble the kind of umbrella authority people traditionally come here to avoid.</p>
        <p>''An Orwellian nightmare,'' declares Michael Antonovich, the L.A. County Supervisor and a dissenting voice on A.Q.M.D.'s governing board. ''We'll pay more bureaucrats and suck money away from research.'' Antonovich's retort to the plan's unveiling - ''Use a barbecue, go to jail!'' - reverberated through L.A.'s media and conjured visions of citizens informing on neighbors who illicitly grill burgers, or police searches through bathroom cabinets for contraband underarm sprays.</p>
        <p>''These are no more expensive than lighter fluid, and they don't evaporate,'' says Lents, opening a door and pulling out a selection of electric charcoal starters, paraffinated briquets and tins of jellied alcohol. ''Plenty of cleaner alternatives already exist, like roll-on deodorant and water-based paint.'' (Continued on Page 30) The environmental technology industry developing in L.A., he adds, is only one factor that will help mitigate the costs of the cleanup. Lents's plan has one crucial advantage: nearly one of every 20 Americans lives in his air-quality district. Once, car manufacturers claimed they couldn't lower emissions, but when California began passing air-quality regulations, the percentage of the market it represents literally forced the invention of the catalytic converter. The same companies are now lobbying Sacramento against A.Q.M.D.'s schedule that mandates vehicles that run on alternative fuels during the next decade and viable electric cars by 2007. The auto companies also are lobbying Washington against the President's recent clean-air bill that mandates the production of 500,000 alternative-fuel vehicles by 1995. Even so, the line of suitors bearing experimental fuel-cells and methanol-powered test vans has already formed at Lents's door.</p>
        <p>H ANS Y. GEISLER, PART-owner of Zipper BMW on Wilshire Boulevard, doesn't expect his Beverly Hills clientele's life style to be terribly disrupted by the incipient all-out war on smog: luxury cars will still be around. Recently, he dined with BMW's chairman, who talked animatedly about methanol- and hydrogen-powered vehicles. ''Europeans used to giggle about California's obsession with pollution, but they're tired of coming down from the Alps into dying forests,'' says Geisler. Will the cost of an electric BMW be prohibitive? ''In this country, we can get used to anything. We got used to gasoline when a gallon suddenly cost a dollar. In 1980, BMW's top-of-the-line sold for $15,000. Today it's $75,000. I don't notice that anyone's stopped buying them.''</p>
        <p>Across the Los Angeles River, in the murky eastern L.A. towns that surround El Monte and A.Q.M.D. headquarters, Francisco L. Escobar, a chemical engineer, is driving a sedan bearing the A.Q.M.D. logo around his old poplar-lined neighborhoods, inspecting for pollution violators.</p>
        <p>Under a canopy of plastic draped over a dirt yard, nine men from the Mexican states of Michoacan and Hidalgo are at their lathes and saws, turning out bed frames on a Saturday morning. Escobar indicates some uncovered paint cans and an evaporating pail of thinner to the bustling little man who is the owner, but doesn't write up an infraction. The owner will need an A.Q.M.D. permit, though, which costs $160. He doesn't mind: ''It's cheaper than bribes in Mexico.''</p>
        <p>Escobar moves on, visiting ironworks, tortilla factories and one of the floating body shops that often appear under freeway bridges. The people are from Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico -''You call this bad air?'' asks one from Mexico City - and each is out of compliance in some way. He issues warnings, but the literature he hands them explaining what materials they must use is in English; translations are only now becoming available. Escobar speaks Spanish, but on days when he is inspecting, say, Korean dry cleaners, his job becomes surreal.</p>
        <p>There are delicate moments - people scattering because they mistake him for a narc or the Border Patrol, or whispering offers of cheap furniture - but mostly everyone is exceedingly polite, simply grateful to be where they can make a living. At one auto paint shop, a worker just two days in America is astounded to learn that here, he can't rinse paint brushes in gasoline. Inside the spray booth, two filter panels are missing, and Escobar has to issue a citation. This is the first day of business for the proprietors, who were living in cars until (Continued on Page 33) they saved to buy this place. In Chihuahua, people painted vehicles outside; here they're being fined $200 because a few fumes escaped.</p>
        <p>Handing them the ticket, Escobar explains that soon a new state-of-the-art spray pistol will be available and they will be required to buy it. The senora blanches when she hears it will cost $385. ''No,'' says her husband, shaking Escobar's hand, ''this is good. We cannot put a price on the earth.''</p>
        <p>When the plan matures in 2007, Asian, black and Latino minorities will comprise the majority - 60 percent - of Los Angeles's population. Daniel P. Garcia, former president of the Los Angeles City Planning Commission, questions whether A.Q.M.D. adequately considered their needs when it began planning everybody's future, especially since its 12 board members are Caucasian. He intends for that to change, in court if necessary.</p>
        <p>On clear days, Garcia can see the working-class neighborhood where he was born, near Chavez Ravine, from his 35th-floor law offices in one of downtown L.A.'s lustrous new skyscrapers. ''I'm tired of being told that poor people breathe bad air, too,'' Garcia says. ''Labor-intensive industries employing mainly minorities are hit hard by this. What happens when small businesses can't afford all these fees and controls?'' He grows wary when A.Q.M.D. people acknowledge that some industries may not have a future in post-smog Los Angeles, if, like blacksmith shops, they can't adjust to changing priorities. The real victims, Garcia argues, will be nonwhite workers.</p>
        <p>Ethnic leaders have now joined businesses in calling for task forces to study the socioeconomic impact of each new rule A.Q.M.D. wants to adopt. ''Dan Garcia is trying to get the little guy on our side,'' says Ross B. Hopkins, a Lockheed spokesman. ''The A.Q.M.D. doesn't understand the impact this has.''</p>
        <p>Mark Abramowitz, now with the Coalition for Clean Air, is concerned that minorities and environmentalists not become adversaries. But he suggests that large polluting companies be made to subsidize a jobs superfund for orphans of dinosaur industries. Larry L. Berg, a University of Southern California political scientist and A.Q.M.D. board member, recommends dedicating a percentage of emissions fines for retooling small businesses. Like Abramowitz, Berg suspects that incessant industry demands for more studies and research are really stalling tactics.</p>
        <p>''They love to complicate things,'' he says. ''Then they tell you that you don't understand them. I don't know the makeup of air as well as an industrial chemist, but common sense tells me that if what's in it can kill plants, corrode metal and destroy marble, it's probably not good for you. If you tell someone the fog he's breathing is battery-acid level, which we've observed here, he'll understand. Corporations keep it complex so people will say, 'We don't understand, so we'll let businesses keep doing it' - like they've solved all the other problems in the world.''</p>
        <p>But the recent decision, prompted by vociferous business objections, to delay approval of the plan pending demonstration of how A.Q.M.D. will assess socioeconomic impacts, has shown advocates that they have far to go to win public support. This perplexes Berg, who, while shamed by his own hopeless addiction to Marlboro Lights, can't understand why people who don't tolerate dumping garbage in the street permit it in their air.</p>
        <p>A University of California at Irvine environmental psychologist, Gary Evans, has tried to find out. By showing L.A. residents slides of landscapes ranging from clear to somewhat smoggy, he has observed that the longer people live here, the less likely they are to acknowledge the presence of pollution. He's not sure why. ''It may be a passive, helpless response,'' he says. ''But they just seem to get used to it.''</p>
        <p>Evans has data showing that nearly nobody follows the smog-level health advisories published in daily papers. ''They keep jogging,'' he says, glancing out his window at the hazy Orange County day. ''Environmental problems don't give immediate feedback like touching a hot stove. When you drive a car, you don't experience long-term ecological repercussions.''</p>
        <p>Evans worries that the A.Q.M.D. is misjudging public commitment to do whatever it takes to lick pollution. ''They don't see the necessity,'' he says. ''This is not like deciding in the 1960's to go to the moon. They got behind Kennedy to beat the Russians, but can you imagine people today getting behind Bush for air quality?''</p>
        <p>Yet psychological adjustment to air pollution does not imply physiological adaptation. For years, a U.S.C. pathologist, Dr. Russell P. Sherwin, has been exposing cages of mice to the fumes emanating from traffic roaring past his central Los Angeles laboratory, noting what appears to be the progressive, irreversible depletion of their respiratory cells. He autopsies pulmonary tissues of accident victims aged 15 to 25, which increasingly resemble the lungs of 40-year-old emphysemics. But so far not enough research has been funded to pinpoint the extent of pollution's link to disease. One problem is that damage owing to dirty air may first manifest itself as a heart condition, a connection people don't make as easily. Also, since smog has only been critical in L.A. for 30 years or so, its most serious effects may be yet to emerge.</p>
        <p>Through reading glasses, Sherwin peers at a slice of lung tissue that resembles a moth-eaten veil, preserved in a plastic binder. ''Breathing cells can be as endangered as any eagle or sea otter,'' he says. ''We wait until Chernobyl happens. We wait until Prince William Sound. Now we're waiting for little daily events in our bodies to add up to enormous disasters.''</p>
        <p>To persuade skeptics that it costs society more not to clean its air, A.Q.M.D. recently commissioned a study that transcends the usual list of crop damage, peeling paint, cracked weather-stripping and wheezing tourists. Using a Cray supercomputer to model basin-wide dosage rates, the study examines the effect of just two contaminants, ozone and airborne particles, on the productive lives of L.A. residents. By tabulating conditions like eye irritation, throat discomfort, headaches and coughing, researchers created variables that economists and laymen alike can grasp, like Restricted Activity Days -''days you might not stay in bed,'' explains a Cal State-Fullerton economist, Jane V. Hall, the study's director, ''but you're tired, your chest is tight and you're not good for much.''</p>
        <p>The study calculates that by reducing the missed work and school days, use of medication, and shortened life-spans that result, Los Angeles would save from $9.4 billion to $14.3 billion annually. ''And this,'' Hall adds, ''looks at just two pollutants, and doesn't begin to compute lost leisure time or the costs of general misery.''</p>
        <p>Even using figures from opposing studies that don't take health into account, she says, ''Jobs will increase faster than the population, and personal income will more than double. This economy is so dynamic that A.Q.M.D.'s plan gets lost in the noise.''</p>
        <p>Y ET A VIBRANT economy assumes that people can actually get to work. The L.A. County Transportation Commission notes a $30 billion shortfall between actual funding and the price of the 270 miles of light and heavy rail, freeway improvements and transit-fleet modifications A.Q.M.D.'s plan prescribes to ease poisonous congestion. Completion of the much-heralded, initial 4.4-mile section of a long-awaited subway is mired somewhere beneath downtown L.A. in wearying delays and multimillion dollar overruns.</p>
        <p>From the Metro Traffic Control helicopter cruising above the Santa Monica Freeway, the vehicles below resemble corpuscles struggling through cholesterol-choked veins. ''It smells,'' remarks the traffic reporter Rhonda Kramer, ''like someone threw up on a Christmas tree.'' Over on the northbound Hollywood, an overturned mattress truck has everything paralyzed for four miles by the time the wreckers appear. If L.A. can't build itself out of gridlock via mass transit, and since no one seriously believes that growth can be contained (except an A.Q.M.D. board member, Sabrina Schiller, who proposes they distribute birth control), even more cars are inevitable.</p>
        <p>Land in town is too valuable to sacrifice for more freeways, so double-decking, once thought preposterous, is now taken more seriously -ground was just broken for a short busway segment over the Harbor Freeway. Expecting average traffic speed to drop from 37 to 15 miles per hour by 2007, Jerry Baxter, a CalTrans District 7 director, is studying radar-activated brakes coupled with imbedded electrical guidance systems: ''This would eliminate human error and let us shove double the number of cars on the freeways.''</p>
        <p>Martin Wachs, former head of U.C.L.A.'s Urban Planning Program, scoffs at such public-works schemes: ''First, eliminate the free parking that 90 percent of employees get. If companies want to subsidize their help, give them cash instead. Whoever wants to blow it all on a parking space can do so. Those who want to pocket some of it will car-pool. Traffic would drop one-third. It would cost the public nothing. That's why no one's pushing this - it doesn't create construction jobs.''</p>
        <p>Car-pooling is, in fact, one of A.Q.M.D.'s major tenets, which it considers far less radical than limiting car registrations, or restricting 20 percent of circulating vehicles each day by their license numbers, as Mexico City and Santiago are trying. Free-(Continued on Page 48) ways now have lanes reserved for multiple-occupancy vehicles, and soon all firms of 100 or more employees will need ride-sharing plans. Hughes Aircraft, the basin's biggest employer, spends $500,000 annually on what may be the world's largest such program. Yet after 10 years, just 19 percent participate. Hughes guarantees its car-poolers a ride home in case of emergencies and has a fleet of 302 vans for employees to share. Those who do so arrive noticeably more relaxed than co-workers who fight the freeways solo, but having the freedom and privacy of one's own automobile dies hard - 60 percent of employees polled refuse even to consider giving that up.</p>
        <p>Still, like telecommuting -using computer modems to avoid transporting an entire human when only his mind is needed - A.Q.M.D.'s goal of about 1.5 bodies per vehicle won't require drastic self-denial, because everyone car-pooling once or twice a week will significantly thin traffic. Executives may find the option of napping on the way to work, or simply dialing in, to be liberating. But there will be little choice where cars are concerned - they will have to run on something far purer than gasoline, which pumps nearly 70 percent of the mess into L.A.'s skies.</p>
        <p>For now, methanol seems to be winning the alternative fuel war that A.Q.M.D.'s plan has escalated. It can be used in so-called flex vehicles that also accept conventional fuel, and it will more easily accommodate existing delivery systems than competitors like compressed natural gas. But some plan supporters privately feel that bringing in anything short of electric vehicles is a little like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.</p>
        <p>Though cleaner than gasoline, water-soluble methanol is highly toxic and can be absorbed through the skin. When burned, it produces formaldehyde, an active carcinogen that will demand tricky controls. Corrosive methanol requires stainless-steel tanks -and because it is half as potent as gasoline, switching will mean bigger storage facilities and more tanker trucks.</p>
        <p>A steaming maze of pipes, boilers and massive tanks belonging to 17 refineries is already a familiar part of L.A.'s skyline. James S. Morrison, executive vice president of L.A.-based ARCO, the area's biggest gasoline retailer, says his company will sell methanol as an alternative to going out of business. But petroleum companies warn that, because refining methanol from coal is politically impossible due to greenhouse-effect anxieties, we will be mainly dependent on foreign sources of natural gas to make it. ''And who,'' Morrison asks, ''will loan or invest $50 billion to build plants for a fuel to be phased out by electric technology?''</p>
        <p>But James Lents of A.Q.M.D. notes that methanol buses are already appearing in Los Angeles and that fuel-cells, a kind of refillable battery that is practically pollution-free, can run on it. The technology is still primitive, but Japan already has a fuel-cell forklift. Some prototype vehicles using rechargeable batteries now promise double the previous 60-mile range, making them viable for delivery fleets, and research on three continents keeps raising the score. By 2007, Angelenos may zip through town in light vehicles recharged by electric strips buried in the pavement. Auto makers continue denying that a mass-market version of anything electric is feasible soon, but as Lents notes, ''Twenty years ago, who would have predicted we'd all have computers?'' AS LOS ANGELES PIO-neers the social and technical experiments to determine if metropolises of tomorrow can grow cleaner as well as bigger, delegations from cities around the globe arrive to watch - including befouled third-world cities that cannot afford the process but may benefit from its products. Los Angeles, in turn, looks at the world.</p>
        <p>Recently, Lents told a Senate Energy Committee hearing that Congress must fund whatever research is necessary to reduce greenhouse gases and eliminate fossil fuels: global warming, if unchecked, would ''nullify most of the improvement which would be made through our 20-year cleanup plan.''</p>
        <p>Halting urbanity's exhaust may not be enough. F. Sherwood Rowland, the University of California at Irvine chemistry professor who first discovered that man-made chlorofluorocarbons were ravaging the upper atmosphere, worries that trace gases like methane, produced by proliferating rice crops and cattle in the crowded developing world, may someday equal carbon dioxide as an ambient warming agent. The future of our air, he suggests, may depend on vast social adjustments the world must face together. But Arthur M. Winer, an atmospheric chemist at U.C.-Riverside, believes that L.A.'s plan might still work: ''The atmosphere will dominate mankind's concerns in the next century. What we're doing here is a hopeful step.''</p>
        <p>''Someday,'' adds James Lents, ''we may get power from fusion, from an orbiting power station beaming it down, from a solar cell in the desert, from tapping the subterranean heat of the earth. We want to be ready. If we don't try, we'll never know if we could have succeeded.''</p>
