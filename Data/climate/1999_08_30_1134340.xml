        <p>The White House and Senate Democrats say they are preparing for a pitched battle with the Republican-controlled Senate to save one of the top foreign policy goals of President Clinton's waning Administration: a treaty banning nuclear testing.</p>
        <p>Armed with public opinion polls and the support of many scientists, military commanders and arms control groups, Democrats are threatening to bring the Senate to a standstill when Congress returns next month from summer recess unless Republicans agree to hold hearings this year on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which 152 nations have signed.</p>
        <p>Without the treaty, Mr. Clinton warned this month, ''countries all around the world will feel more pressure to develop and test weapons in ever more destructive varieties and sizes, threatening the security of everyone on earth.''</p>
        <p>His Administration's new push for the treaty has been prompted in part by a raft of unsettling developments -- India's and Pakistan's growing nuclear ambitions, the possible test-launching of a long-range missile by North Korea, and the strong possibility that China has upgraded its atomic arsenal using stolen American nuclear secrets.</p>
        <p>But Senate Republicans are balking, and before the Senate will vote on the treaty the Administration will probably need to satisfy both the Republicans and the Russians on related arms-control issues, the geopolitical equivalent of pulling off a triple bank shot.</p>
        <p>The Republicans say they do not want to go forward with any new treaty until they are assured that the country will quickly build a limited defense against long-range missile attack. But Russia wants the United States to slash its nuclear arsenal before it will consider changes to a landmark treaty that bars such a shield.</p>
        <p>If these two conditions are met, it could free up the test ban treaty, which Republicans have held up. Mr. Clinton signed the treaty in 1996 and sent it to the Senate for approval in September 1997, but arms control advocates say he has not yet made ratification a public issue or fought hard for it in Congress.</p>
        <p>''There ought to be the makings of a grand deal in all this,'' said Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee. ''But the President has to play a major role. He could affect this more than he has.''</p>
        <p>Administration officials say that in the coming weeks, Mr. Clinton and top foreign policy aides, like Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, will push the treaty more publicly.</p>
        <p>The Democrats' effort faces stiff Republican opposition. The treaty is bottled up in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, whose chairman, Jesse Helms of North Carolina, is locked in a fight with the Administration over two other treaties that Mr. Helms wants to kill before dealing with the test ban pact.</p>
        <p>Those two treaties -- a pact to fight the dangers of global warming that the United States signed last year and a set of amendments negotiated two years ago to the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty -- are unlikely to gain the two-thirds Senate support needed for approval, Administration officials conceded.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, citing reasons other than likely defeat, said the time was not ''ripe'' to send those two treaties to the Senate. Republicans say Mr. Clinton cannot pick and choose which treaties the Senate acts on quickly. A stalemate has resulted.</p>
        <p>There are three possible paths around Senator Helms and other foes, test ban treaty supporters say. One is to generate public pressure by painting Republicans as reckless for blocking a step that would encourage India and Pakistan to sign the treaty. That in turn could force moderate Republicans to prod Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, to overrule Mr. Helms.</p>
        <p>Only two Republicans, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and James M. Jeffords of Vermont, openly support the test ban treaty. Other Republicans, including Maine's two Senators, Olympia J. Snowe and Susan M. Collins, support holding hearings, but have not committed to the treaty.</p>
        <p>Another tactic, which Democrats have used successfully in the past, would be to tie the Senate floor in knots until Mr. Lott relents. Mr. Biden, along with the Democratic leader, Thomas A. Daschle of South Dakota, and Senator Byron L. Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat, say they are willing to wage that kind of guerrilla warfare if needed.</p>
        <p>The final and most ambitious route involves a three-way deal that hinges on negotiating changes to the Antiballistic Missile Treaty with the Russians to allow a limited national defense. Such a deal would almost certainly include a new strategic arms reduction treaty, Start III, that the Russians want and that could reduce each side's nuclear arsenals to 1,500 warheads from more than 6,000 currently.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia blessed such talks in June, for the first time. Discussions started this month in Moscow and will resume on Sept. 17, when Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott meets with a Russian Deputy Foreign Minister, Georgi Mamedov, in Washington.</p>
        <p>Enormous hurdles remain. The United States has said it will not seriously negotiate a Start III treaty until Russia's Communist-dominated Parliament ratifies the Start II pact, which calls for reducing the level of nuclear warheads to 3,000 to 3,500 on each side. That prospect appears increasingly dim.</p>
        <p>Russia has long opposed an American missile defense, fearing that the United States would use it as an excuse to reprise the much grander ''Star Wars'' system, which would be dauntingly expensive to match. But Russia's strategic forces are declining and it lacks money to pay for new systems. Striking a deal, even if it means swallowing modifications to the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, may be the only way for Moscow to maintain nuclear parity with Washington.</p>
        <p>Both sides also see a narrowing political window of opportunity before presidential election politics in Russia and the United States next year make it extremely difficult to strike an accord. Experts say both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Yeltsin are mindful of their legacies.</p>
        <p>''It's a lot like a trans-Atlantic flight,'' Robert G. Bell, the President's senior director for defense policy and arms control at the National Security Council, said of the nexus of issues. ''Landing is the critical phase. What we're trying to do is bring all this in for a landing in the last year or so of the Clinton and Yeltsin administrations.''</p>
        <p>At the core of the dispute between the Senate and the Administration is a fundamental difference in arms control priorities. Democrats are seeking to maintain and build on three decades of deals that limit and reduce nuclear arsenals and countries' ability to develop more powerful atomic weapons.</p>
        <p>Republicans argue that the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, and the means to deliver them, has rendered traditional arms control useless, and that building a national defense against long-range attackshould be the country's top goal.</p>
        <p>''For Republicans, arms control is a secondary approach for national defense,'' said Senator Gordon H. Smith, an Oregon Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee.</p>
        <p>Hindering that goal, Republicans say, is the Administration's continued embrace of the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, which limits the kinds of national defenses Russia and the United States can develop.</p>
        <p>Even if some grand deal can be struck, the test ban treaty confronts several roadblocks. Even though 152 nations have signed the accord, so far only 21 of the 44 nations whose approval is required for the treaty to take effect, including Britain, France and Japan, have ratified the pact. Even one holdout among the 44 nations, like North Korea, could prevent the treaty from taking effect.</p>
        <p>Although the treaty sets up a global system of sensors to monitor compliance, critics contend that verifying the agreement would be difficult.</p>
        <p>Treaty proponents argue that it would lock in American superiority achieved in 1,030 nuclear tests between 1945 and 1992, when the United States agreed to halt testing. Failure to ratify, supporters say, could open the door for emerging nuclear states, like India and Pakistan, to conduct more tests, and may also weaken support for other arms pacts, like the treaty to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.</p>
        <p>Five current and former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff support the testing ban, which would eliminate underground nuclear tests, as atmospheric testing is already banned. The treaty also has the suport of most arms control experts and the directors of the nation's nuclear laboratories, which are responsible for maintaining the safety and reliability of America's nuclear arsenal through nonexplosive nuclear experiments, including sophisticated computer simulations.</p>
