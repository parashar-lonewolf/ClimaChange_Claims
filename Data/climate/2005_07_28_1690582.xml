        <p>House and Senate negotiators cleared the way on Wednesday for major transportation legislation, and the finishing touches were put on an energy bill as Congress raced to wrap up its business before leaving for the summer.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Senator Bill Frist, the majority leader, announced he would not try to force a vote in the next few days on a repeal of the estate tax, leaving that issue until Congress returned in September. But the Senate is expected to approve a politically charged measure protecting gun manufacturers before the week ends.</p>
        <p>Under the tentative agreement on the highway and mass transit bill, Congress would provide $286.5 billion for roads, bridges, mass transportation and safety over six years, assuring each state will eventually receive a return of at least 92 cents on its fuel tax dollar.</p>
        <p>Senator James M. Jeffords, independent of Vermont and a senior member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, said the final product would ''make our nation's roads and bridges safer, less congested and create thousands of jobs from coast to coast.''</p>
        <p>House officials said they anticipated a vote as early as Thursday followed by a vote in the Senate. A senior Senate aide, who asked not to be identified because he did not want to speak for the White House, said the administration had not threatened to veto the highway bill even though it exceeded President Bush's request to hold spending to $284 billion.</p>
        <p>That ceiling contributed to the inability of Congress to reach agreement on a highway bill last year, forcing a series of stop-gap measures to keep money flowing through the Transportation Department. Members of both the House and Senate wanted a significantly more expensive bill.</p>
        <p>The text of the final bill was not publicly available on Wednesday, but lawmakers acknowledged that it would be filled with thousands of projects sought by individual members of Congress, making the measure one of the most popular pieces of legislation with both parties.</p>
        <p>According to a preliminary analysis, 80 percent of the money will go to road projects, 18 percent to mass transportation and the remainder to transportation safety and other projects. Lawmakers dropped a Senate plan to withhold money from states that do not adopt tougher rules on drunken drivers who are repeat offenders or have high blood alcohol levels.</p>
        <p>Along with the highway measure, the energy bill is progressing toward passage this week in the House and Senate, allowing the Republican majority to claim victory on two bills that have been stalled for years.</p>
        <p>Congressional tax writers released their plan for $14.5 billion in energy-related tax breaks and incentives, though with savings from some provisions, the cost to the treasury will be $11.5 billion.</p>
        <p>The tax breaks are less than the amount initially approved by the Senate and more than sought by the Bush administration and the House. They will provide $2.9 billion in tax advantages to the coal industry; $3.1 billion for electric power producers and distributors; and $2.6 billion to companies producing, refining and distributing oil and gas.</p>
        <p>Energy-efficiency and conservation programs will get $1.3 billion, alternative motor vehicles and fuels will qualify for $1.3 billion and renewable fuels such as wind and solar used in electricity will take up to $3.2 billion.</p>
        <p>''The result is a final tax package that's well-balanced among renewable energy, conservation and traditional energy sources,'' said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Finance Committee. ''Renewable energy and conservation got a very big slice of the pie.''</p>
        <p>The efficiency incentives, which include tax breaks for owners of hybrid cars and those who install energy-saving appliances at home, were scaled back from those initially approved by the Senate as were the industry tax breaks. But some advocates said it was a step in the right direction.</p>
        <p>The legislation ''will increase the use of energy-efficiency technologies to extend our nation's energy supplies,'' said Kateri Callahan, the president of the Alliance to Save Energy. ''But the bill falls far short of making energy efficiency a cornerstone of U.S. energy policy.''</p>
        <p>Critics of the energy bill continued to condemn it on Wednesday, saying the tax breaks rewarded oil and gas companies that do not require taxpayer-financed incentives. They pointed to a late addition to the measure that provided $500 million to underwrite research into drilling in deep water or producing gas from unconventional sources.</p>
        <p>As the Senate concentrated on gun legislation, its passage was virtually guaranteed Wednesday when Mr. Frist used a procedural maneuver to sharply limit efforts by Democrats to amend the bill.</p>
        <p>The gun liability measure, which would put an end to lawsuits from states and municipalities seeking to hold gun makers liable when their weapons are used in the commission of crimes, is a major legislative priority for the National Rifle Association. It failed last year when the rifle association, irate that Democrats had amended the bill, abruptly withdrew its support and instructed Senate backers to do the same.</p>
        <p>The bill's chief opponent, Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, had threatened the same strategy this year. Mr. Frist countered with a tactical maneuver that at first prohibited any Democratic amendments, then permitted just one: a provision that would explicitly permit suits against gun makers if their weapons lacked child safety locks.</p>
        <p>''One of the great rights around here is the right to offer amendments,'' Mr. Reed said on Wednesday, adding, ''It seems to me that this whole travesty has been dictated by the N.R.A.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Reed argued that the measure would set a new legal precedent, undermining states and municipalities in favor of an industry whose profits are not threatened by the suits. But Mr. Frist said gun makers needed the protection. ''Many people believe that the whole gun manufacturing industry is a hugely profitable industry, and that's wrong,'' he said. ''It isn't. The gun industry is relatively modest.''</p>
        <p>The bill has 67 co-sponsors -- including 13 Democrats -- in the Senate, 7 more votes than necessary to block a filibuster. The Senate is expected to vote Friday on a motion to formally take up the bill for debate; a final vote is expected before the Senate leaves on recess.</p>
