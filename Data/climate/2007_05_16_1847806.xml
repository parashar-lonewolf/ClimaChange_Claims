        <p>The recent suspension of two Phoenix Suns’ players is a counterproductive overreaction at a time when the N.B.A. could use a riveting playoff series.</p>

        <p>With a man of David Stern's worldliness -- as a Johnny Appleseed on an odyssey to sprinkle the N.B.A. throughout the planet -- it is remarkable how Global Dave just ignored climate change.</p>
        <p>Stern acted as a commissioner hermetically sealed in a 1997 time capsule when he decided late yesterday to suspend the Suns' Amare Stoudemire and Boris Diaw for leaving the bench when they witnessed San Antonio's Robert Horry play court goon on their stitched-up star.</p>
        <p>Horry all but knocked the bandage off Steve Nash's nose as he whipped the Suns' playmaker into the scorer's table at the end of Game 4 Monday night. Restraint in the moment of truth -- with Stoudemire and Diaw ultimately kept out of the brief confrontation -- did not factor into the N.B.A.'s penal code.</p>
        <p>The moment Stoudemire and Diaw stepped 20 feet from their bench, they fell through a wormhole to the N.B.A.'s playoff past, back when Patrick Ewing wandered 30 feet from the Knicks' sideline to rubberneck at a free-for-all between Charlie Ward and Miami's P. J. Brown.</p>
        <p>Ewing's one-game suspension in 1997 effectively ruined the Miami series for his team and, ultimately, undermined what was probably the Knicks' best chance to demystify Michael Jordan.</p>
        <p>''I felt they robbed me,'' Ewing said of the N.B.A. police at the time. ''They robbed me of a great opportunity.''</p>
        <p>The theft of Ewing did not damage the league's interests, though. The N.B.A. remained afloat on Jordan's aura and marketing boom. The league still possessed a popularity reservoir deep enough so the N.B.A. could go unscathed as it held a key player to an irrationally strict interpretation of a rule that requires teammates to remain as potted plants on the sideline when conflict erupts on the court.</p>
        <p>Intent of player movement is never a consideration. Only court geography counts. In the case of Stoudemire and Diaw, the league's ambiguous requirement for players to remain in the vicinity of the bench was violated. What does vicinity go for these days? On the Monday night in question, Stoudemire and Diaw inched toward what the league defines as an altercation. Is it a fight if no punches are thrown?</p>
        <p>''It's not a matter of fairness,'' Stu Jackson, the N.B.A.'s executive vice president, explained during a conference call last night. ''It's a matter of correctness.''</p>
        <p>Correctness should be a matter of context. It has been 10 years since Ewing's benign transgression. A rule that seemed inconsequential to the league's radiant health then is on the verge of adding to its image erosion now.</p>
        <p>As it is, the league's audience and market value and viewer size are shrinking. Until Stern meddled, the Suns and the Spurs were in the process of reinvigorating a lost audience that was learning to love the N.B.A. again during an intense Western Conference semifinal series.</p>
        <p>It was tied at 2-2 by the Suns in Game 4. Just where fans wanted it. Now its equilibrium has been unjustly tipped by a commissioner in tough-love mode.</p>
        <p>''This is a very unfortunate circumstance,'' said Jackson, who was in the awkward position of speaking for Stern, the ultimate authority. ''No one here wants to suspend players for any game, much less a pivotal game in a playoff series. The rule is the rule, and we intend to apply it consistently.''</p>
        <p>The N.B.A.'s application is self-defeating. The Suns, one of the biggest draws in basketball, may be potentially sabotaged in their journey to an N.B.A. title by a penalty that punishes bystanders while rewarding the instigating team.</p>
        <p>''Dirty, dirty, dirty,'' Stoudemire said of the Spurs on Monday night.</p>
        <p>Do the math on Stoudemire's series-long refrain: The Spurs' Bruce Bowen kneed Nash in Game 3, but received no suspension. Now Stoudemire, an All-Star, and Diaw, an essential cog, will be watching Game 5 tonight from a hotel because they were concerned about whether Nash had been turned into a chalk drawing on the court by Horry, a journeyman, who was suspended for two games. The league basically out-disciplined itself, boxed in by its own code.</p>
        <p>''I mean, you know, everything we do at the league office is up for re-evaluation,'' Jackson said. ''If a change is warranted going forward, we will look at tweaking the rule. Presently, the rule is what it is.''</p>
        <p>The rule is without nuance. And yet officials make judgment calls all the time on player intent when issuing technicals and flagrant fouls.</p>
        <p>In some ways, with his hard-line response to the Suns, Stern seems to be competing against N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell in a game of disciplinarian double-dare. Stern does not have Goodell's headaches with players in legal trouble. He just acts as if he does.</p>
        <p>Stern has been on edge for three years since the melee between the Pistons and Pacers. He is in no-mercy mode, evident when he whacked Antonio Davis with a five-game suspension last year for rushing into the stands in Chicago when he thought his wife was being harassed by a hothead fan. Overreactions invite an inspection of image problems where they don't exist. If punches had been thrown between Nash and Horry, if Stoudemire and Diaw had exacerbated the conflict, suspensions would be appropriate.</p>
        <p>This was not Rudy Tomjanovich-Kermit Washington revisited from 30 years ago. This was not even Ward and Brown from 1997. This was an overreach by a commissioner who cannot detect the subtleties of climate change between now and then.</p>
