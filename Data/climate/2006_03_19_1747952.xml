        <p>DEBBIE WHITCRAFT has been living at the Jersey Shore for 50 years, so sometimes she is a bit cavalier when it comes to the shifting sands on her beloved Long Beach Island.</p>
        <p>Still, as the mayor of Beach Haven, those shifts and flows are part of Ms. Whitcraft's administrative and political concerns.</p>
        <p>''When I first came here, the dunes were so high and the vegetation was such that you had to put planks on them to get over them to the beach,'' Ms. Whitcraft said in a recent interview. ''It's a shame, but they are not there anymore. The storms come, even minor ones, and they always do some damage. We have overbuilt to the east and become our own worst enemy. But you can't unring the bell. You have to deal with what you have.''</p>
        <p>But the ocean has a head start. Indeed, according to the State Department of Environmental Protection, by the end of this century, the sea level along the New Jersey coast may be two to three feet higher because of global warming, more flooding and more beach erosion. But that has not stopped property values along the shoreline from soaring.</p>
        <p>Last fall and this winter were not unduly harsh along the state's 127 miles of Atlantic Ocean coastline, but several pockets of serious erosion and a measure of controversy visited Ms. Whitcraft's Long Beach Island nonetheless.</p>
        <p>David Rosenblatt, administrator of the office of engineering and construction for the Department of Environmental Protection, said the fall and winter started out badly, with two northeasters in October.</p>
        <p>''The beaches in Harvey Cedars and some places in Beach Haven and Holgate were just weakened by the storms right off,'' Mr. Rosenblatt said. ''When something like that happens, just a normal winter will start erosion. That's how beaches are. It is why we need to have replenishment programs.''</p>
        <p>But one of the replenishment programs has triggered a lawsuit against the Department of Environmental Protection by some Long Beach Island homeowners. The environmental agency, along with the Army Corps of Engineers, wants to rebuild some of those dunes that Ms. Whitcraft remembers from her youth, while homeowners -- in favor of some beach replenishment -- are concerned that the scope of what has been proposed will cost them their ocean views and property rights.</p>
        <p>The Corps of Engineers is demanding that property owners sign easements allowing the public onto their swaths of beach, above the high-water line. In addition, before the state contributes its part of the $71 million for the project -- which would deposit another 11 million cubic yards of sand on the beach -- the Department of Environmental Protection is insisting that towns provide parking, public beach-access points every quarter-mile and public bathrooms every half-mile.</p>
        <p>''The government says the dune is there to help protect you, to increase your property values,'' said Kenneth Porro, the lawyer for the homeowners. But the problem, he said, is that the proposed project, which would run through much of the center of the island, would erect dunes 22 to 28 feet high and 125 feet wide from east to west -- a significant change from what is essentially a flat beach.</p>
        <p>''I can tell you that you don't pay three or four million dollars to have a 28-foot-high wall of sand in front of you,'' Mr. Porro said.</p>
        <p>Stewart C. Farrell, a marine geologist who directs the Coastal Research Center at Richard Stockton College, said that Long Beach Island residents might be so adamantly opposed to the dunes partly because the storms this year and over the previous decade have been relatively tame.</p>
        <p>''Except for those few areas in and around Beach Haven and some isolated beaches elsewhere, it has been a so-so winter,'' Dr. Farrell said.</p>
        <p>He said that according to his records, there have been about a dozen days in each of the last few winters when the winds were coming in from the northeast at 25 miles an hour or more, which he considers a benchmark for possible beach damage.</p>
        <p>''That builds waves and can chew up some beaches, especially at high tide,'' Dr. Farrell said. ''But that's not what we have to worry about long term.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Farrell said that although there was a powerful storm in February 1998, the last ones of any real consequence to the coast took place in December 1992 and in October 1991. In the 1991 storm, he said, waves breached the Boardwalk in Ocean City, causing $4 million in damage just on the Boardwalk. And in 1992, a $2.2 million dune project along the Ocean City boardwalk had been completed in the summer before the storm hit in December.</p>
        <p>''It was so bad that they put sandbags in the Holland Tunnel, saving the city itself from floods,'' he said. ''But the damage to the Boardwalk -- zero. That was because of the new beach fill.''</p>
        <p>Because more and more people have chosen to live at the beach, Dr. Farrell said, dune rebuilding and beach replenishment are more necessary than ever. ''Most of these people with beachfront property have never seen a significant storm,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He said that about 5 percent of the oceanfront properties turn over each year in New Jersey, so that at least half the current beachfront homeowners were not around for the 1992 storm, which would have devastated them.</p>
        <p>''I have gotten into it with some people who now maybe don't care because they have enough money to replace the house,'' Dr. Farrell said. ''But if you want to make sure your little van Gogh in the sunroom doesn't go floating down the beach one day -- and anyone who has been here long enough knows the day will come -- then you better want some dunes in front of you.''</p>
        <p>Currently, there are several beach-filling projects along the coast, rebuilding beaches that have eroded over the last couple of years, including the north end of Brigantine in Atlantic County and beaches in Avalon in Cape May County.</p>
        <p>In addition, North Wildwood, also in Cape May County, is considering a beach replenishment project at its north end. The rest of the Wildwoods have the widest beaches in the state, with some stretching 600 yards from the Boardwalk to the ocean at low tide. That is because the currents near the shore shift sand from north to south from Barnegat Bay down to Cape May. From Barnegat up the coast to Sandy Hook, the sand shifts from south to north.</p>
        <p>Dr. Farrell said that because the storm winds came mostly from the north this winter, and because Monmouth County had an extensive beach replenishment and dune project in 2000, there was little damage to any of that county's beaches.</p>
        <p>But the story was far different in southern Ocean County, at the lower tip of Long Beach Island, which is part of the Holgate section of the Edwin B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge.</p>
        <p>Vinnie Turner, the wildlife biologist at the refuge, said the spit at the end of the island had grown by a mile since 1990, just from the sand that had drifted south from the rest of Long Beach Island.</p>
        <p>''It ebbs and flows, sometimes not more than a few yards a year coming down from the northern end of the island,'' Mr. Turner said. ''When the beach erodes, people may not know where it goes, and often it just goes on the end of the island.''</p>
        <p>Steve Atzert, the manager of the refuge, said the Holgate section of the refuge was started in 1960 when the federal government bought 256 acres from the National Audubon Society.</p>
        <p>''Now we have at least 450 acres, almost double the land, and it is all just accumulated sand over the years,'' Mr. Atzert said. ''Erosion is what happens when you are near the ocean. It is the natural course of things, and anyone who thinks it won't happen will be awfully surprised when some big storm comes.''</p>
