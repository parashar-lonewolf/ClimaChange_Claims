        <p>LEAD: The New York State Board of Regents voted unanimously today to prohibit commercially sponsored television programs in the state's public schools, dealing a severe blow to the company that hopes to beam a daily news broadcast for teen-agers into the nation's classrooms.</p>
        <p>The New York State Board of Regents voted unanimously today to prohibit commercially sponsored television programs in the state's public schools, dealing a severe blow to the company that hopes to beam a daily news broadcast for teen-agers into the nation's classrooms.</p>
        <p>The action makes New York the first state to impose an outright ban on the 12-minute news program, known as Channel One, which includes advertisements for candy bars, acne cream, sneakers and cars. The Regents said the program would violate the state Constitution's provisions against using school property for private gain.</p>
        <p>Coupled with California's decision last month to withhold a small amount of state aid from schools that carry the program, it cast strong doubt on the ability of Whittle Communications, which markets the program, to achieve its goal of reaching 40 percent of the nation's high schools, with an audience of 6.5 million teen-agers.  Aid May Be Withheld</p>
        <p>Other states are considered likely to follow the lead of California and New York, which have the first- and third-largest populations of high-school students in the country. Texas, with the second-largest high school population, has not taken up the matter.</p>
        <p>Although Whittle is the only company so far to seek to market a program with commercials directed at students, the Regents made clear that their ban would apply to any similar program that might be developed.</p>
        <p>Their vote authorizes the State Education Department to take strong action, including the withholding of all state aid or the dismissal of school administrators, against any school or school district that accepts commercially sponsored television programs.  Different From Other Ads</p>
        <p>It was not immediately clear whether the ban would apply to a videotape of a commercial program, like a documentary or a network news show, that a teacher might show to students on a one-time basis. But one lawyer for the Education Department said that if such a tape were not brought in specifically for the benefit of an advertiser, it would probably not be a violation.</p>
        <p>State education lawyers said the television program is different from other kinds of advertisements allowed in schools, like those in magazines or on wall posters, because technically the students are not required to look at such ads. Whittle's contract with schools stipulates that the students must be shown the commercials.</p>
        <p>The 16-member Board of Regents, which is chosen by the Legislature, is responsible for selecting the state's education commissioner and has a broad mandate to set regulations for the state's public schools. 'Academic Acid Rain'</p>
        <p>TheRegents' deliberations were part of an intense debate over the propriety of television commercials in schools, which one national educator calls ''academic acid rain,'' but which Whittle stoutly defends as a small price for educating youths on world events.</p>
        <p>The vote by the 13 Regents who met here today was a resounding victory for the state's Education Commissioner, Thomas Sobol, who argued forcefully against the program and called Whittle's offer to schools of free television sets, video equipment and satellite dishes to broadcast it a ''Faustian bargain.''</p>
        <p>It also capped an intensive lobbying effort by Whittle, which is based in Knoxville, Tenn., to persuade the Regents to allow the program into New York schools. Several Regents said today that they were irritated by Whittle's aggressive approach. Their monthly meeting was thrown into some turmoil today when one of the Regents, J. Edward Meyer, accused the company of making ''offers of employment or consultancies'' to some Regents in recent days. Mr. Meyer, a lawyer and former state Assemblyman from Armonk, declined to cite specific instances. Challenge Undecided</p>
        <p>A Whittle vice president, Laura Eshbaugh, said she had ''no knowledge'' of such offers, adding, ''That's not the way my company operates.'' She said that the company had not decided whether to mount a legal challenge.</p>
        <p>Whittle's chairman, Chris Whittle, said he was disappointed with the Regents' decision, but he maintained it would not be fatal to Channel One's ultimate success. He said the Regents' action would simply ''reduce our waiting list'' for schools elsewhere that will want the program.</p>
        <p>Mr. Whittle also called Mr. Meyer's accusation ''a total fabrication.''</p>
        <p>Several educators and advocates for children hailed the ban. 'A Wonderful Day'</p>
        <p>''This is a wonderful day,'' said Peggy Charren, president of Action for Children's Television, a nonprofit group. ''We shouldn't have our schools telling teen-agers that they need a Ford in their lives.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Charren said she doubted Whittle's program could survive now because it had lost the largest markets in the country and because other states were sure to adopt similar bans.</p>
        <p>Noting that some parochial schools allow students time for prayer or reflection each morning, Mr. Sobol said it would be a sad parallel if state schools had students ''spending two minutes of silence to observe commercials for Levi's jeans and Snickers.''</p>
        <p>One Regent, Shirley C. Brown, said ''the insidious destruction of the lives and values of kids that those two minutes a day can accomplish means to me that we've got to say here: 'Absolutely no. At least for that time that those kids are under our care you will not do this.' ''</p>
        <p>The Board's chancellor, Martin C. Barell, said earlier this week that Whittle had ''piqued my imagination'' with offers of free video equipment. But he said today that ''on more mature reflection'' he opposed the program. A Vow to Push On</p>
        <p>Mr. Whittle said ''there are 50 states in the Union,'' and he vowed to push on with his project. His company announced the venture at the beginning of this year, and in March began a $5 million pilot broadcast to six high schools in California, Kansas, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, and Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Whittle said he expected that the broadcast would ultimately cost $200 million a year, financed by four 30-second commercials a day, which would costs sponsors about $125,000 each time a commercial was shown, he said.</p>
