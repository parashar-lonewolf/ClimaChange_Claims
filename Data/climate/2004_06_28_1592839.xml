        <p>THE PRESERVATIONIST  By David Maine  230 pages. St. Martin's Press. $21.95.</p>
        <p>In some ways, the protagonist of David Maine's first novel is an unremarkable figure. But in other ways he is rather special. For one thing, he is 600 years old. For another, God talks to him. God has just told him to build a very large boat before a flood destroys the world.</p>
        <p>Using quotations and spellings from the 1914 printing of the Douay Bible (first published at Douay, France, in 1609), Mr. Maine calls this man Noe. We know him more commonly as Noah, but in any case we know his tale. He receives a warning; he builds an ark. He fills it with animals and stays onboard for more than six months. He sends out birds to survey the inundated earth, and when a dove comes back with an olive branch he knows the worst is over. When God then instructs him to go forth and multiply, he obliges.</p>
        <p>What justifies Mr. Maine's appropriation of this biblical story? The author is clearly more interested in imagination than in cannibalization. He envisions the events in Noe's life with a mixture of awe and realism, and with a voice that is clear, distinct and (remarkable, under the circumstances) dry. ''We'll not be going to the sea,'' Noe tells his wife, upon announcing that he must build the ark. ''The sea will be coming to us.'' And, ''This is one storm we don't want to be caught out in, hm?''</p>
        <p>The wife is 14 years old, and she is dubious. ''So when Himself starts with the visions and the holy labors and the boat full of critters, what am I supposed to do?'' she asks. She is also just irreverent enough about the pleasures of being married to a man six centuries old. ''Himself was a novelty all right,'' she tells the reader. ''Lizard skin and hands like roots. Big cloud of hair like a patch of uncut wool dragged through the dust a few dozen times.'' And when it comes time to multiply: ''The way he carries on, I expect to be a widow by morning. Grunts give way to moans and then strangled shrieks, as if the old boy's being eaten by ants.'' There aren't many particulars that Mr. Maine leaves unmentioned.</p>
        <p>''The Preservationist'' is poised somewhere in the gap between holy visions and practical details (like the hygienic upkeep of a floating ''barnyard in a box''). It is an elegant, inventive book and in no way a cynical one, despite the author's keen appreciation of the incongruous. After having to answer questions about just how much timber he needs for this undertaking, Noe closes his eyes and thinks, ''Things were much clearer when God was explaining.'' The book resounds with the gravity of Noe's mission even as it invents the quotidian details of his story.</p>
        <p>''A lesser man might be tempted to lie,'' Mr. Maine writes about Noe's calling. ''A greater man might proudly refuse to answer. Noe is an ordinary man, 600 years old, conversing with giants, touched by God. He says, The Lord intends to destroy all the earth.''</p>
        <p>And why should those who are doomed agree to help him? ''So you are not forgotten forever,'' he says, adding, ''So that when we survive to tell our story, and our sons and grandsons do the same, your memory will live on within us.'' Indeed, by the time the book is in midflood, Noe's son Japheth is adding: ''At least we'll have a Hell of a story to tell the grandkids, thinks I.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Maine, who grew up in Connecticut and now lives in Pakistan, brings a broad range of attitudes to this literary embroidery. He can write eloquently, as when he describes the animals finally debarking (''Elephants squelched knee-deep in marshy soil; big cats slunk away like sinners''). He can be almost flippant: ''Rain pelts down like God's judgment, which it is.''</p>
        <p>And he can envision the roots of mankind's different races. When one of Noe's daughters-in-law rescues two babies, ''shriveled and black as bats,'' before the flood begins, the miracle of their survival causes one idolatrous tribesman to ditch his own deity and say ''I'd very much like to meet this Yahweh of yours.''</p>
        <p>''You will,'' Noe's daughter-in-law assures him.</p>
        <p>In its shadings of light (gambling on the ark, using monkeys and water buffalo as currency) and dark (Noe's nightmare visions of those he could not save), ''The Preservationist'' is a book with a broad range. It is also quick and succinct, remarkably so when contemplating divine power. ''He's a master craftsman I'll grant,'' says Noe's son Cham -- whose bringing on a curse for mocking his father's nakedness is one more of the biblical events that this book dramatizes. ''But unlike most such He's short on respect for the things He builds and a touch too eager to reduce them to dust.''</p>
        <p>''The Preservationist'' establishes both its author's temerity and his talent with that kind of observation. And it has the audacity to ask the ultimate question about the flood: Why did God do it? The book's characters have various answers, from ''because he wants to encourage us to do better'' to ''because he can.'' But the one that sticks comes from Japheth, and captures the no-nonsense vigor of this novel: ''Because He's the boss and don't you forget it.''</p>
