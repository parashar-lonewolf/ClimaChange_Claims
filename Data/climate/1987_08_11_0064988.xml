        <p>LEAD: The Pacific Gas and Electric Company recently learned it was losing its biggest customer. The Chevron refinery in Richmond, Calif., decided to save money by generating its own electricity.</p>
        <p>The Pacific Gas and Electric Company recently learned it was losing its biggest customer. The Chevron refinery in Richmond, Calif., decided to save money by generating its own electricity.</p>
        <p>The electric company, however, is fighting to keep its other big customers. In recent years it has slashed rates for industrial customers by 25 percent and negotiated additional discounts for selected customers. But to make up for the lost industrial revenues, Pacific Gas and Electric, which serves northern California, is trying to raise what it charges homeowners and apartment dwellers.</p>
        <p>What has begun in California is beginning to happen throughout the nation. The electric industry, long staid and stable, a regulated monopoly, is entering a period of competitive turmoil and deregulation that is bound to change it fundamentally. Some Will Pay More</p>
        <p>Almost certainly the change will mean greater choice and lower prices for some customers - mainly the big commercial and industrial users, which can turn, or threaten to turn, to other sources for power. But critics warn that it could also mean bigger electric bills for residential customers and small businesses - those stuck with the local electric company.</p>
        <p>In many ways the changes taking place in the electric industry are similar to those that have occurred in the past few years in the telephone industry, with many of the same potential benefits and drawbacks for consumers.</p>
        <p>''Exactly the same kind of things exist in the electric industry that existed in the telephone industry before the breakup'' of the Bell System in 1984, said John A. Anderson, executive director of the Electricity Consumers Resource Council, a group of 20 large corporate users of electricity.</p>
        <p>Indeed, electric industry executives are saying that big nonresidential customers are ''bypassing'' the utilities by generating their own power, just as some big companies have bypassed local telphone companies and set up their own phone networks. They also say that their industrial and commercial customers are paying more than the true cost of serving them, in effect subsidizing residential rates. This too echoes the telephone debate.</p>
        <p>Just this month, the Connecticut Light and Power Company asked approval to reduce industrial and commercial rates and possibly raise residential rates slightly. The company wants rates to ''reflect the true cost of serving each customer class,'' a spokesman said. A Demand for Cheaper Power</p>
        <p>Several things are driving the move toward more competition. Customers are demanding cheaper power. Technology is making it easier for some customers to generate their own electricity. And the Reagan Administration is pushing for deregulation. Martha O. Hesse, chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates the electric industry, has proposed sweeping changes intended to greatly enhance competition in the industry.</p>
        <p>Supporters of more competition say it would reduce electricity costs by speeding new technology and bringing in new suppliers. This could lower power costs for all consumers, even residential ones, they say.</p>
        <p>''The future health of the electric power system may well rest with our ability to put competition to work to assure the adequacy and efficiency of future power supplies,'' the Energy Secretary, John S. Herrington, told utility executives in June. Jersey Conducting a Study</p>
        <p>Other government officials are also intrigued by the possibility of lower rates. Gov. Thomas H. Kean of New Jersey recently established a commission to examine whether more competition and market-based pricing could reduce rates in his state.</p>
        <p>But critics - including some utility executives, regulators and consumer groups - say the trend poses great hazards.</p>
        <p>They see bigger bills for consumers who remain dependent on the local power company. To be sure, in the short run, upward pressure on electric bills are being offset by other factors, including changes in the Federal tax law, lower oil prices and interest rates and the declining capital needs of utilities, few of which are building new power plants. But over the longer haul rates could go up - perhaps a lot in some regions - if large customers stopped buying power from their local utility.</p>
        <p>In addition, some experts warn that free-wheeling competition would make it harder to manage the nation's fragile electricity transmission system, resulting in more power outages.</p>
        <p>''The lights will go out, my friend,'' said Howard P. Allen, chairman of the Southern California Edison Company. ''And when they do, competition won't bring them back.'' Broad Changes Under Way</p>
        <p>For the foreseeable future, consumers will continue to be served by their local electric company or municipal utility, with rates regulated by state commissions. But much else about the industry is already changing, in ways akin to those in other recently deregulated industries.</p>
        <p>* Electric companies are no longer the only ones generating electricity. They are being joined by big companies that make power for themselves and by entrepreneurial companies that generate power and sell it to the utilities. The non-utility power producers range from the Dow Chemical Company's plant in Freeport, Tex., whose output of 1,400 megawatts is enough to supply power to more than a quarter of a million homes, to Dennis and Cindy Amen of Eureka, Calif., whose windmill generates one kilowatt, enough for a dozen lightbulbs. Seeking an alternative to the high rates charged by the Long Island Lighting Company, the Grumman Corporation recently signed a contract to have a consortium of independent companies build a generator to provide it with 30 megawatts of electricity.</p>
        <p>* Electric companies are starting to show more flexibility in rates, especially for big customers. To keep a steel plant as a customer, Pacific Gas and Electric recently agreed to a long-term contract with lower rates. In Connecticut, the United Illuminating Company is negotiating a similar special contract with New Haven's Hospital of St. Raphael, which has threatened to generate its own power.</p>
        <p>* Utilities are ''unbundling'' their rates - offering different levels of service for different prices and charging separately for different components of service. This is similar to what happened in the phone industry, where companies began to charge for such formerly free services as directory assistance.</p>
        <p>* Geographic boundaries that separate one utility's territory from another's are eroding. Some big companies are seeking to buy power from utilities other than their own. And some utilities, with excess capacity, are seeking customers outside their territory. The Chicago suburb of Geneva, Ill., for instance, last year dropped its local utility, Commonwealth Edison, and began buying from the Wisconsin Electric Power Company, more than 100 miles away.</p>
        <p>* Utilities themselves are diversifying into other businesses, just as the phone companies have done. Florida Power and Light acquired an insurance company, while San Diego Gas and Electric has a software subidiary. Utilities are stressing marketing and slashing work forces to gird for the competitive era.</p>
        <p>* Investing in utilities is becoming far riskier. When utilities enjoyed a market monopoly, public utility commissions guaranteed them a fairly steady profit and the utilities paid steady dividends, attracting conservative investors. But these tenets are starting to crumble. State commissions are no longer willing to pass construction costs automatically on to ratepayers. Earnings are becoming erratic, and some utilities can no longer pay their dividends. The Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation this month slashed its dividend nearly in half and suffered a huge loss in its latest quarter, largely because it was unable to recover the costs of a nuclear plant. The Public Service Company of New Hampshire, weighed down by the costs of its idle Seabrook nuclear plant, is struggling to avoid bankruptcy - a fate almost unthinkable for a utility in the past. Spinoffs Expected</p>
        <p>These developments, experts say, are likely to force the industry to undertake a radical restructuring. Some say, for instance, that it would mean the end of integrated electric utility companies - those that generate and distribute power - as we now know them. To compete with the private generating companies, the utilities will have to spin off their own generation operations into separate, unregulated, entities.</p>
        <p>Under this scenario, the end result would be an industry of unregulated power generating companies competing to sell electricity to regulated distribution companies.</p>
        <p>An even bigger change might come in electric transmission. The electric companies control those lines, which they use to transmit their power. Now they are being pressed to open those lines for use by others.</p>
        <p>This would enable a company in California, for instance, to buy power from a coal-fueled generating plant in Wyoming and deliver the power from Wyoming to California by using the transmission lines of all the companies in between. This process is called wheeling. Price Trends</p>
        <p>The electric utility business was once a model of stability. For decades, demand for electricity grew at about 7 percent a year as the nation prospered. Electric companies added ever larger plants, which produced electricity ever more cheaply. Indeed, prices, measured in 1984 dollars, declined from 17.8 cents a kilowatt hour in 1929 to 4 cents in 1970.</p>
        <p>The situation began to unravel in the 1970's, when the sharp rise in oil prices raised energy costs dramatically. So did delays and expense overruns in the construction of nuclear plants and the cost of new environmental safeguards for coal-fueled generating plants.</p>
        <p>Electricity has more than tripled in price since 1970; even adjusted for inflation, prices have climbed more than 50 percent. Industrial customers, in some instances, were burdened with a greater increase as regulators tried to shelter small consumers. Demand Slows</p>
        <p>Demand for electricity slowed drastically as customers embraced conservation, and overall economic growth slipped. Demand grew only 3.2 percent a year from 1973 to 1980 and by an even slower 1.7 percent a year in this decade. Utilities found themselves completing huge, costly nuclear plants when new capacity was unneeded.</p>
        <p>The need to sell the excess power has led utilities to seek markets outside their territory, feeding the appetite for wheeling.</p>
        <p>Other trends have led to the creation and rapid growth of non-utility power producers. One was a tougher stance on rates by regulators, which has discouraged utilities from building new generating plants. Regulators have begun denying utilities the ability to recover some construction costs, arguing that they were excessive and that the plants were unneeded in any case.</p>
        <p>The Arab oil embargo of 1973 gave rise to a concern about dependence on foreign oil and to a move to develop alternatives, such as solar energy and other renewable energy supplies.</p>
        <p>In 1978, Congress passed the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act, or Purpa. Under the law, independent companies could produce electricity that the local utility had to buy at prices equal to what it would have cost the company to generate the power itself.</p>
        <p>''Purpa was the watershed event in our industry,'' said Marc A. Vallen, manager of corporate strategy for San Diego Gas and Electric. ''Once the competition is entrenched, you can't put the genie back in the bottle.''</p>
        <p>The utility industry itself is divided as to how far deregulation should go. At present, Congress appears in no mood to spur further deregulation. It has already blocked a regulation requiring Government-owned facilities, such as military bases, to seek bids from potential power suppliers, rather than merely buy from the local electric company.</p>
        <p>Indeed, a backlash may be developing because of increased confusion caused by the breakup of the Bell system and by frequent delays in air travel often attributed to airline deregulation. ''The experience with telephones made people a lot more cautious,'' said Paul F. Levy, chairman of the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities, which is nonetheless moving to encourage some competition among power suppliers.</p>
