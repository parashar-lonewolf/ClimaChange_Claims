        <p>In a rare collaborative undertaking, three of the country's leading philanthropies are establishing an Energy Foundation to promote energy efficiency and greater reliance on renewable sources like wind and solar power.</p>
        <p>The foundation is being financed by an initial $20 million from the Rockefeller Foundation, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation of Chicago and the Pew Charitable Trusts of Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>The partnership was conceived long before the Persian Gulf crisis, the sponsors said after announcing the plan yesterday at a news conference in Washington. But they said current events underscored the need for a new energy strategy for political, economic and environmental reasons.</p>
        <p>"At a time of grave danger and volatility in the Middle East, it is worrisome that the United States is increasing its dependence on foreign oil, especially so because there are other proven alternatives," said Hal Harvey, an energy engineer who will be executive director of the Energy Foundation.  Goals of Foundation</p>
        <p>The foundation, which will have its office in San Francisco, will identify innovations for conserving energy and will seek to promote their use nationwide. It will also provide funds for research and public education and work with government agencies and environmental groups.</p>
        <p>Peter C. Goldmark Jr., president of the Rockefeller Foundation, said: "It is time to conceive of energy efficiency as a source of energy just like oil in Alaska or coal in Montana. That's what this foundation is all about. We want to promote an 'efficiency reserve' that is one of the cleanest, safest and cheapest sources of energy we have."</p>
        <p>Adele Simmons, president of the MacArthur Foundation, said the sponsors conceived their energy partnership in 1989, convinced that there was growing public support for the concept of energy efficiency. "It was clear to us," she said, "that there are many constituencies ready to move ahead -- the utilities, regulators, environmentalists and policy makers -- and this was so even before the Iraqi developments put energy on the national agenda."</p>
        <p>Pew, the country's second largest philanthropy after the Ford Foundation, joined the venture because of its potential to make a difference, said Rebecca W. Rimel, its executive director. "With some effort, we should be able to save between 30 percent and 50 percent of the energy this country now consumes annually. That's what makes this a beautiful program. Regretfully, we do not have the means to do away with poverty, crime or drugs. This is doable."</p>
        <p>The foundation will start out by focusing on areas where there is a high potential for energy savings, in fields like electrical utilities, building construction and transportation. Rewards for Efficiency</p>
        <p>For example, it will promote model practices adopted by electrical utilities like Pacific Gas and Electric, which offers cash rebates for customers who switch to more efficient energy equipment, ranging from light bulbs to refrigerators.</p>
        <p>In the transportation field, which consumes 27 percent of the country's energy supply each year, the foundation will encourage the use of technologies that could double the fuel efficiency of automobiles in this country.</p>
        <p>In the building construction trades, the use of more efficient windows, advanced lighting, heating and cooling systems could reduce energy consumption by 50 percent, said Mr. Harvey.</p>
        <p>He said costs of renewable energy sources were significantly reduced in the last decade, making them competitive with fossil fuels. "Wind power produced by California utilities now produces enough electricity to meet the annual needs of 900,000 people," he said.</p>
        <p>Welcoming the establishment of the foundation, Dr. John H. Gibbons, director of the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, noted that the Federal budget for energy conservation, which he said "should be the centerpiece of any United States strategy to reduce oil dependency," was cut drastically in the early 1980's. Predictably, he said, progress in energy efficiency suffered.</p>
        <p>"This new foundation," he added, "has unfettered resources, not tied by ideological in-fighting."</p>
