        <p>Op-Ed article by US Repr Frank Pallone maintains rising sea levels caused by global warming are threatening New Jersey's coast; holds US should follow New Jersey's example and adopt sensible energy policy, focused on conservation and efficiency, which would also help stabilize gas prices, reduce dependence on foreign oil and improve air quality (M)</p>

        <p>TWENTY years ago, the most serious threat to the New Jersey coast came from medical waste washing up on our beaches and toxic waste dumped in the ocean. Today, that threat comes from something slower and quieter but no less threatening: rising sea levels caused by global warming.</p>
        <p>A report issued last November by three Princeton University researchers found that global warming could raise the sea off New Jersey nearly 4 feet by the end of the century. Such a rise would put 3 percent of the state underwater and reduce our shoreline by almost 500 feet, meaning that houses and businesses close to the ocean would be forced to move or get washed away.</p>

        <p>TWENTY years ago, the most serious threat to the New Jersey coast came from medical waste washing up on our beaches and toxic waste dumped in the ocean. Today, that threat comes from something slower and quieter but no less threatening: rising sea levels caused by global warming.</p>
        <p>A report issued last November by three Princeton University researchers found that global warming could raise the sea off New Jersey nearly 4 feet by the end of the century. Such a rise would put 3 percent of the state underwater and reduce our shoreline by almost 500 feet, meaning that houses and businesses close to the ocean would be forced to move or get washed away.</p>
        <p>This rise in sea level would also come with substantial increases in flooding and related disasters, especially during northeasters and hurricanes. More than 9 percent of the state would be subject to periodic coastal flooding.</p>
        <p>To prevent this nightmare from becoming a reality, we need a sensible energy policy focused on conservation and efficiency. Conveniently, this approach would also help stabilize gas prices, reduce dependence on foreign oil and improve air quality.</p>
        <p>New Jersey has certainly taken strong steps toward developing such a policy. In 2001, the state started its Clean Energy Program, which offers rebates and other incentives for the purchase of energy-efficient appliances or other equipment for homes or businesses. More recently, Gov. Jon Corzine signed an executive order to increase efficiency and to lower energy use by the state government.</p>
        <p>The state has also tried to tackle global warming by passing the Clean Cars Act, which will reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cars 15 percent to 18 percent by 2020. Even better, New Jersey was one of the original states to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a compact among eight Northeastern states setting mandatory limits on carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
        <p>But New Jersey can't do it alone. The looming threats posed by global warming -- and the necessary responses -- are national and international in scope, and they will require leadership at the highest levels.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the energy bill passed by Congress and signed into law by President Bush last year demonstrated none of that leadership. It was filled with giveaways to the fossil-fuel industry, but lacked serious measures to develop more energy-efficient technologies or ease our addiction to oil.</p>
        <p>We need to ditch that approach and develop a new federal energy policy that builds on efforts like New Jersey's recent programs. Such a policy would be a critical building block to a new commitment from the United States to work domestically and engage internationally to reduce greenhouse emissions and slow the pace of global warming.</p>
        <p>A critical component of this policy would be to increase the fuel economy of the cars and trucks we drive, which are responsible for nearly a third of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. If Washington got serious about improving fuel economy standards, you might only need to fill up your car every other week rather than every week. Collectively, then, we would slow the pace of global warming by drastically decreasing the amount of fuel needed to drive the same distances without forcing New Jerseyans to move closer to where they work or make other disruptive lifestyle changes.</p>
        <p>We also need to make the houses we live in, which are responsible for about 20 percent of our nation's greenhouse gas emissions, more efficient. Federal programs promoting energy-efficient appliances, lighting and heating and cooling systems would go a long way toward reducing the amount of electricity we use in our homes. This electricity is too often produced from coal-fired power plants, which produce the most greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to the fact that New Jersey has some of the worst air quality in the country.</p>
        <p>If we brought efficiency technologies into our homes and our businesses, we could still have every modern comfort we've come to expect -- at a cost of only pennies a day -- while also helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.</p>
        <p>It's frustrating that we haven't done so already, since America has the technology, the innovative drive and the know-how to move from an energy policy that encourages unrestricted consumption toward one that emphasizes efficiency. Individual states and companies have already started taking these kinds of actions, but we need a bipartisan energy summit meeting to develop a national policy.</p>
        <p>These bold actions are critical to preventing the effects of global warming from washing away the Jersey Shore.</p>
