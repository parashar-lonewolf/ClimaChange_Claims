        <p>THE AMERICA I HEARD SINGING WHEN I WAS a teen-ager in the late 1950's forced  homosexuals into hiding, ignored or derided the disabled, withheld rights from suspects of crimes and kept women in their place, which was usually the kitchen  and sometimes an abortionist's back room. It foisted prayers on schoolchildren,  paid no attention to the health needs of the impoverished or the elderly, endangered endangered species and threw people out of work because they held an un-American ideology. In certain places, it denied black Americans the right  to sit where they wished to on a public bus, to drink from a public water fountain, to eat in restaurants, stay in hotels, go to public schools with whites or vote.</p>
        <p>Every one of these conditions has been corrected or improved by laws and attitudes derived from a philosophy that is held in such low esteem it dare not  speak its name. Today, as America enters the 1996 Presidential election year, it is singing two different tunes. One is "Liberalism Is Dead and I'm Feeling So Sad." The other is "Liberalism Is Dead and I'm Feeling So Glad." If this keening and gloating sounds familiar, it is. You last heard it in the election year of 1992. The gloating came most elegantly from Irving and William Kristol, the formidable father-son team of conservative thinkers. In an article in Commentary, William, the son, stated that "liberalism is in a deep crisis" and has "a hollowness at the core." Irving wrote in The Wall Street Journal that "the beginning of political wisdom in the 1990's is the recognition that liberalism today is at the end of its intellectual tether."</p>

        <p>THE AMERICA I HEARD SINGING WHEN I WAS a teen-ager in the late 1950's forced  homosexuals into hiding, ignored or derided the disabled, withheld rights from suspects of crimes and kept women in their place, which was usually the kitchen  and sometimes an abortionist's back room.

        <p>Every one of these conditions has been corrected or improved by laws and attitudes derived from a philosophy that is held in such low esteem it dare not  speak its name. Today, as America enters the 1996 Presidential election year, it is singing two different tunes. One is "Liberalism Is Dead and I'm Feeling So Sad." The other is "Liberalism Is Dead and I'm Feeling So Glad." If this keening and gloating sounds familiar, it is. You last heard it in the election year of 1992. The gloating came most elegantly from Irving and William Kristol, the formidable father-son team of conservative thinkers. In an article in Commentary, William, the son, stated that "liberalism is in a deep crisis" and has "a hollowness at the core." Irving wrote in The Wall Street Journal that "the beginning of political wisdom in the 1990's is the recognition that liberalism today is at the end of its intellectual tether."</p>
        <p>Regrets over liberalism's death arrived in defensive books from equally thoughtful people who celebrated the New Deal and the Great Society as brave last stands against the inevitable, and in statements like that of the former Democratic Presidential candidate Walter Mondale that liberals "kind of used up  the old agenda." The final draft of the Democratic Party platform in 1992 openly spurned liberalism by attempting to stake out a middle ground between laissez-faire capitalism and the welfare state. Respected authors sought to redefine the term. Jim Sleeper, Mary D. and Thomas Byrne Edsall and Mickey Kaus, among others, produced books that searched for a liberalism that repudiated liberalism.</p>
        <p>What is interesting about these two kinds of attacks, since both are attacks  with different motives, is that underneath it all, they take their ardor from the presumption that liberalism is not dead, but robust and established. They are right. "Liberal society is in trouble," says the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr., "but I would be surprised at a retreat from a basic liberal ethos." Conservative Republicans like to point to their slim majority in Congress as a sign that liberals are goners, but analyses of public opinion show that the majority of voters in 1994 never heard of the Contract With America, or of plans to reduce Medicare, Medicaid, public assistance and education and environment programs. They simply wanted the Democrats out. Americans have never hated big government as much as they have loved its services. But their feelings go beyond self-interest. It is highly unlikely that they will approve of the budget severities proposed by Congress, because they have accepted, indeed embraced, the national obligation to help the young, the elderly, the ill and the poor. This is sometimes difficult to prove, but as was said in the O. J. Simpson trial, the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.</p>
        <p>Liberalism dominates the debate and defines the terms of the debate. The conservative assaults on the L word, which were made most effectively by President Reagan, have been so routine over the past 16 years that there is a whole generation of people under 35 who have never heard "liberal" uttered as anything other than a joke or an insult. Yet they live in a liberal country. Conservatives may have ruined the word but have adopted most of the content of liberalism. If this year's Democratic platform looks Republican, it will not be  so much that the Democrats have abandoned the liberal agenda but that the Republicans have absorbed it.</p>
        <p>The liberalism I am thinking of is a kind of general cultural-political liberalism, a mixture of the New Deal programs of the 1930's and the individual-rights movements of the 1960's, which knocked the wind out of all the callous, restrictive and narrow-minded conditions that I grew up with a few decades ago. It is a malleable philosophy, generous and socially responsible, that governs how people ought to live with one another in a healthy democracy. It is not the specific liberalism of the Franklin Roosevelt era, or the Lyndon Johnson era, or explicitly that of voting-rights laws or expanded civil liberties, though it creates and encourages such developments. Rather, it is the sentiment that may be traced back to the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution (a superior Contract with America) and to the moderate Enlightenment from which those documents sprang, that people are inherently equal, that they have a right to pursue their individuality in an open society and that the state must use its power and authority to secure their rights and to help the needier among them.</p>
        <p>This liberalism is neither dead nor on the run.The country backs away from it in frightened and hardscrabble times. Most observers concede that it needs to make some corrections in its details and attitudes. And from the viewpoint of liberal candidates seeking office, it needs to regain political power to further its aims. But in its competition with conservative thinking for the soul of America, it has won hands down.</p>
        <p>"People say that the Great Society failed," says Robert Caro, the historian of the Lyndon Johnson Presidency. "That really is nonsense. Is anyone today suggesting that we resegregate public accommodations, that we have 'colored' and 'white' toilets? It is unthinkable that we would make such retreats. Those aspects of liberalism are now so much a part of America that they are indistinguishable from America. In that sense, America is liberalism."</p>
        <p>So why does it seem that liberalism is on the way out? Because the ruckus that has been raised against it in recent years has been countered by little or  no persuasive defense. Because there have been a number of substantial right-wing victories or near-victories both electoral and involving such issues  as homosexual rights, book and press censorship and flag-burning. Because public figures who oppose one or another element of liberal thought, like Pat Robertson, Ralph Reed, Pat Buchanan and Newt Gingrich, and right-wing talk-show  hosts like G. Gordon Liddy and Rush Limbaugh are more colorful and draw more attention than do their fading targets, like Mario Cuomo or Edward Kennedy. Because liberalism has no true leader. And because it has shot itself in the foot; through careless statements and errors of omission it has misrepresented both its intelligence and its sense of civic responsibility.</p>
        <p>Given liberalism's accomplishments, it is astonishing how silent liberals have been when attacked. In a New York Times article by Tamar Lewin in November  about liberals' response to the proposed Congressional budget cuts, Alan Ehrenhalt, the executive editor of Governing magazine, wondered about "why there is such an eerie silence on issues that are so central to so many people's lives" and said: "There's so many important things going on in Congress with Medicaid, Medicare and welfare reform. I read the paper, and I think: 'Where's the noise?' "</p>
        <p>Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who has long defined himself as a neoconservative, wonders the same thing. He told me: "Liberalism has to learn to deal with the aftermath of its successes. We've lost the labor movement. We've lost the sense of people who need jobs." It was instructive to hear him use the  "we" in describing liberals, but it was not surprising. Like many who call themselves neoconservatives, Moynihan is frustrated with liberal social politics "that have not been able to come to terms with the social decline." Liberalism,  he maintained, "has not produced a more liberal society in my lifetime." He compared neoconservatives to "good Catholics who were excommunicated and who said, finally, 'O.K., we're Protestants.' " Irving Kristol defined a neoconservative as a liberal who has been mugged by reality. Moynihan might say  that a neoconservative is a liberal who has been mugged by a liberal. Yet he conceded: "The conservatives don't have answers either. They merely say that the unemployed are shiftless. Neoconservatism got so disappointed with the turn of liberalism that it found another name."</p>
        <p>Liberals doubt themselves. They doubt their courage and principles, and they  make their self-doubts public. Evidently this is not a new mood. In 1940, Lewis Mumford wrote in the New Republic: "The liberal lacks confidence in himself and in his vision of life. He has shown in every country where the attacks on liberalism have been forceful that he either does not possess stable  convictions, or that he lacks the insight and the courage that would enable him  to defend them." Heywood Broun defined a liberal as "a man who leaves the room when the fight begins." These days, Hillary Clinton speaks of America needing to discover "a new definition of civil society." Why?</p>
        <p>In the interests of fostering open-mindedness, liberals have allowed the misimpression to be bruited about that they have no standards of taste, morality, educational values, spiritual life, community life or common sense. The Wall Street Journal says, "Liberalism today is just plain silly." But conservatives do not need to ridicule liberals when liberals do the work for them. At the 30th-anniversary dinner of the left-wing Institute for Policy Studies in Washington in 1993, the new executive director shamefacedly apologized to the hissing audience for holding the event in a nonunion hotel. The president of the University of Massachusetts, claiming that he is supporting freedom of the press, has refused to condemn anti-Semitic articles in the college newspaper. Mayor Marion Barry of Washington pledged to set up an Office  of Offenders' Affairs, with a staff made up of former prisoners, which would enact liberalized sentencing laws and give "set-aside gate money" to released inmates. Kurt Vonnegut once explained that he never put a villain in his early novels because of the liberal thinking he picked up at the University of Chicago: "They taught us that nobody was ridiculous or bad or disgusting."</p>
        <p>Political correctness, often properly called a fundamentalism of the left, is a bitter joke to all but those who practice it. The lapsed liberal Moynihan calls it "a form of intolerance, as illiberal as an attitude can be." The open society that has allowed for everything from Andres Serrano's urine-soaked Jesus to Jerry Springer, Jenny Jones and Howard Stern suggests that liberalism favors  such aberrations and is to be identified with them. By their awkward silence liberals have confirmed this. The silence has created a vacuum of moral thought  that has been filled by such works as Allan Bloom's "The Closing of the American Mind," the best-selling plaint against the vulgarity and barbarism of liberal education, and William J. Bennett's equally successful and pious "Book of Virtues."</p>
        <p>In a cultural atmosphere in which liberals are assumed to support the purveyors of sacrilege and dirty talk, the purveyors of simple-minded virtue come off as moral leaders, and the public has a choice between the tasteless and the boring. In fact, most liberals who favor the protections of an open society  are appalled by its excesses, but they have not made that clear. It has been said that they are in favor of every subculture except that of married, hard-working, home-buying, church-going Americans. The themes raised by conservatives that have been warmly welcomed by the rest of the country are not  taxes or a trickle-down economy, but rather an evocation of communal values and  morals.</p>
        <p>The popular image of the liberal remains a shaggy, dewy-eyed Edward Koren cartoon character, vaguely professorial, swishy Los Angeles or dour Manhattan Upper West Side, predictably reactive and wretchedly anachronistic. He still listens to Peter, Paul and Mary, and wonders where all the flowers have gone. He is a member of the overeducated, oversensitized elite -- a teacher or a social worker or a Hollywood producer or, the worst of the lot, a journalist. He has (or shows) a disdain for money and tends to stigmatize those who stray from the  orthodoxy. The liberals who do not carry that image, like Bill Bradley and Sam Nunn, have left or are about to leave politics, thus reinforcing the impression  that liberalism has no steam left. They, too, are moving toward family values, but because they are simultaneously moving out of Washington, their shift of focus seems more a desertion than an assertion, and in some cases it is.</p>
        <p>Liberals have also diminished their stature by condemning the teaching of what goes by the name of middle-class morality in schools, by referring to teen-age motherhood as just another manifestation of family life, by appearing to pay more attention to the rights of criminals than to the plight of victims.  Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, says, "Nothing causes liberals more political harm than that perception." Passively or actively, they  have contributed to the picture of an America composed solely of victimized minority groups. They have dwelt on small-potatoes infringements like the raising of creches and menorahs in public squares. A mainstay of liberalism, the separation of church and state, has taken the odd form of a disregard of, and disrespect for, religion. The notion that liberals are anti-religion has emboldened the crackpot intolerances of the religious right.</p>
        <p>Much of this self-destructive behavior was born of overconfidence bordering on cockiness. In the January Dissent, Michael Walzer of the Princeton Institute  for Advanced Study cites two off-the-mark liberal responses to the Barry Goldwater Presidential defeat in 1964: the historian Richard Hofstadter predicted that conservatism "had no future in an increasingly modern, secular, liberal and pluralistic America." Seymour Martin Lipset, professor of sociology  at Harvard, wrote in the British magazine Encounter: "It cannot be stressed too  strongly that the politics of backlash, whether religious-cultural, economic, or racially motivated, is a consequence of the fact that the U.S. is becoming more  liberal. The groups now reacting with such desperation are desperate precisely because they are growing less influential and less numerous."</p>
        <p>When liberals had the numbers and the self-confident power in the early 1970's, Roe v. Wade was seen as a political victory exclusively. The inherent confusion, doubt and pain in a woman's decision to have an abortion, and the opposition of most religious groups, including the Roman Catholic Church, were overridden by a formalistic declaration of rights -- a woman's right to choose.  That right was, and is still, seen by most Americans as reasonable and sensible, yet liberals saw no need to have an open, sympathetic discussion with those who  were opposed to abortion rights. The failure to acknowledge the right to abortion as something more complicated and more human than a political victory contributed to the backlash against it in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>Liberalism is most scorned for its association with big government, even though liberals were against the abuses of Presidential power under President Johnson in Vietnam and President Nixon in Watergate. While originally fearing a  too-powerful state, it has been seen as willing and eager to give the state power in order to realize egalitarian goals. In "Liberal Purposes" (1991), Professor William A. Galston of the University of Maryland wrote: "A government  too weak to threaten our liberties may be by that very fact too weak to secure our rights, let alone advance our shared purposes."</p>
        <p>Yet the fact remains that with all of liberalism's missteps and inadequacies, America has signed on to it. There are major areas of activity, like the rights  of women and of members of minorities, and the environment, that could not have  changed the American landscape without great numbers of people agreeing that they wanted government in their lives. Since the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the presence of minority-group members in the workforce has grown from  11 percent to 23 percent. "Of course we don't have social justice," says Robert  Caro, "but we have moved a long way toward it."</p>
        <p>Women today make up nearly half the managerial and professional ranks. This is because of big government -- Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Equal Pay Act of 1963, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974. Suzanne Levine, editor of the Columbia Journalism Review, said, "There has not been a single woman in this country who has not been changed by the last 30 years of activism, and even those who resist what used to be called 'women's lib' are beneficiaries of it."</p>
        <p>Even affirmative action, one of the most fragile and hotly contested of liberal programs -- debated by both conservatives and liberals -- has proved to  be wanted, at least in some form, by most Americans. Last year much was made of  California's attempts to outlaw affirmative-action programs in that state, but California businesses are not abandoning their affirmative-action programs. State bills in Texas and in Mississippi died in committee or went down to defeat.</p>
        <p>One of the less noted but highly significant areas in which government has proved indispensable is the environment. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the effects of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, signed by President Bush, will reduce the country's air pollution by over 49 billion pounds per year. The number of cities violating the air-quality standards for carbon monoxide has dropped to 9 from more than 40 in the past five years. Sulfur dioxide emissions, which cause acid rain, have been reduced by 2.6 million tons.</p>
        <p>In short, since the 1960's, the public, rather than seeking to reduce a governmental presence in the environment, has sought to ratchet it up. Bipartisan support passed the Clean Air Act Amendments in 1990 by 401 to 25 in the House and by 89 to 10 in the Senate. Industry has experienced no serious loss. Du Pont and other chemical companies have been given incentives to develop ozone-depleting chemicals. Air-quality regulations in Southern California have not touched the economy. The timber interests in Oregon originally claimed that  forest-saving efforts would drain state revenues, but keeping the trees vertical has so increased tourism -- while making the state attractive to high-tech industries -- that now Oregon has the lowest unemployment numbers in a generation.</p>
        <p>None of this is to claim that the country is not genuinely concerned with the amount of big government in its life -- although there often seems to be as much formulaic reaction against it as there is against "knee-jerk liberalism," or "big business." The reality is that in major areas of activity, it very much wants to keep government big.</p>
        <p>The triumph of liberalism is not a political victory. Rather it is a triumph  of temperament and attitude; it reflects how America wishes to exist. It has been said that liberalism is confounded by an unrealistic optimism about the possibilities of human advancement. But the idea was born in 18th-century rationalism. It picked up 19th-century Romanticism along the way as it moved forward, and the combination of thought may be read in the Constitution and the  Bill of Rights -- an 18th-century document with a number of 19th-century riders.</p>
        <p>The truth of liberalism is that it is both optimistic and pragmatic. It believes in improvement but not in perfectibility. It is often embarrassed by the freedoms it supports and encourages, and by the unwieldiness of the government it promotes. But it believes in the dream of human nobility, which historically has proved equally fanciful and reasonable.</p>
        <p>Perhaps, as happens from time to time, America appears to be fed up with liberalism and prepared to shut down its normal impulses for a while. But every  such period is followed by a further advance of both freedom and equality, because this is the way the country has wanted to go. Within my lifetime, America has progressed from a nation that quashed human rights and diminished human dignity to one that worries about cultural influences and a budget. Most people would call that a triumph.</p>
