        <p>The Ford family is meeting at a time of turmoil in the auto industry as Ford Motor's chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., makes plans to restore his company.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>William Clay Ford Jr. was recently asked if it was fair to call him, as many have, a reluctant chief executive of the Ford Motor Company.</p>
        <p>''Not anymore,'' he said, pondering the question at a news conference last month. ''No. No. I'm not reluctant at all.</p>
        <p>''I think when I stepped into it I would have said the timing was not my choosing,'' he continued. ''I have a young family. And I guess in a perfect world -- I mean, you do make trade-offs in this world and you know part of it is, you know, that there is tension in terms of wanting to spend time with my kids. and spending time at home with my family.</p>
        <p>''But everybody faces that in their job,'' he added. ''So was the timing ideal from a personal standpoint? No. But you can't choose your timing. I'm not reluctant at all anymore. Not that I ever was. I shouldn't say anymore. I think it was more of a timing issue.''</p>
        <p>If the struggles of its crosstown rival, General Motors, have been generating much bigger headlines, many analysts nonetheless say that Ford -- founded in 1903 by Mr. Ford's great-grandfather, Henry Ford -- is not in much better shape.</p>
        <p>Ford, to be sure, remains profitable while G.M. has lost nearly $4 billion through the first nine months of the year. But both companies are overly dependent on sales of pickups and big sport utility vehicles. Both are suffering steep losses in their crucial domestic automotive operations as fuel prices rise and consumers turn away from gas guzzlers.</p>
        <p>And both companies are heavily burdened by high labor costs and the obligation to support hundreds of thousands of retirees and their families, the so-called legacy costs that have put much of the domestic auto industry at risk.</p>
        <p>On Monday, G.M. announced a landmark deal with the United Automobile Workers union, which tentatively agreed to cut $1 billion from G.M.'s $5.6 billion annual health care bill. This was good news for Ford, too, since G.M., Ford and the Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler negotiate parallel contracts. Concessions made to one are likely to flow to the others, and Ford is already negotiating with the union.</p>
        <p>But the concessions are only first steps. Ford and G.M., analysts say, will need to make further substantial reductions in labor costs, not to mention make more appealing cars and trucks, to have any chance of thriving into their second centuries.</p>
        <p>Members of the extended Ford family will convene Wednesday in the Detroit area for a regularly scheduled, twice-yearly meeting, in large part to check up on their multibillion-dollar family heirloom. Mr. Ford has said that on Thursday, as the company reports its third-quarter results, he will disclose new details of his latest plan to restore his company.</p>
        <p>''It's depressing,'' said Anne Ford, 62, a first cousin of William Ford, in an interview Tuesday. She was referring not only to Ford's problems but also to the auto industry's overall malaise. ''Tomorrow we meet as a family. We do this twice a year. Billy comes and talks to us and tells us what's going on, and I don't think there's a single person in the family that isn't 100 percent behind him.''</p>
        <p>Detroit is in the midst of a titanic confrontation over labor costs as cutbacks driven by powerful competitive forces that rolled through airlines and steel companies are finding their way to automakers and their parts suppliers. This month, Delphi, the auto parts giant that was a division of G.M., filed for bankruptcy protection after it failed to persuade the U.A.W. to agree to steep concessions. In September, Ford's own former parts division, Visteon, forced Ford to reclaim 24 ailing plants and facilities, which it is hoping to sell off over the next couple of years.</p>
        <p>''Detroit is at a tipping point,'' John Casesa, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, wrote in a report issued Tuesday that downgraded his ratings on both G.M. and Ford to sell from neutral.</p>
        <p>''Like steel, textiles, airlines and other American industries that have undergone radical restructurings,'' Mr. Casesa added, ''we expect an increasingly volatile and difficult environment for the companies involved and for their shareholders.''</p>
        <p>Is Mr. Ford the man to lead Ford Motor through Detroit's doldrums?</p>
        <p>The jury is still out. When he took over as chief executive -- he already served as chairman -- the company was poised to report a $5.5 billion loss for 2001 after the disastrous tenure of Jacques A. Nasser. Mr. Ford, who is 48, is the first Ford family member to run the company since his uncle, Henry Ford II, presided over the company into the late 1970's.</p>
        <p>Four years into his tenure at the top, Mr. Ford is rolling out his second turnaround strategy. While his company restored profitability with slow, steady progress in his first three years in the job, the wheels came off this year as more American customers left Ford and G.M. for Toyota and other Asian rivals.</p>
        <p>In the first half of this year, Ford reported a $2.2 billion profit. While that is far better than G.M.'s performance, Ford's results are down about 30 percent from the first half of 2004. According to Thomson Financial, analysts expect an operating loss of 10 cents a share in the third quarter, or about $180 million, but still expect a profit for the full year.</p>
        <p>But the company's most important business, its North American automotive operations, lost $657 million before taxes in the first half of the year. Ford is struggling to sell its flagship vehicles; this month, it is offering no-interest financing on 72-month loans for 2005 model Ford F-150 pickup trucks, as well as Ford Explorer, Ford Expedition and Lincoln Aviator sport utility vehicles. The company does have some momentum in the car market, with new midsize car models from Ford, Lincoln and Mercury hitting the market at the right time.</p>
        <p>Still, the North American operations continue to suffer from a management in flux and product development that has been hit or miss: the redesigned Mustang generated rave reviews while Lincoln and Mercury remain less than robust brands.</p>
        <p>Last month, Mr. Ford named the fourth executive in four years to run operations in the region, Mark Fields. The promotion of Mr. Fields, who has a mixed record in previous roles as a top executive abroad, led to the departure of Ford's top product development executive in North America, Philip R. Martens, and the region's top manufacturing executive.</p>
        <p>''If you go to Ford and talk to different individuals within Ford, you clearly see Bill is a great guy and he's respected for being a good human being,'' said Brett D. Hoselton, an analyst with KeyBanc Capital Markets and a former financial analyst for Ford. ''That said, it doesn't necessarily mean you're qualified to run an organization of that magnitude. I don't think he necessarily wanted to run the company.''</p>
        <p>''Have they made significant improvements?'' Mr. Hoselton asked. ''The results suggest that we're not seeing any sort of a dramatic turnaround in the organization.''</p>
        <p>In response to the critics, Oscar Suris, a spokesman for the company, said: ''Bill Ford is determined to put innovative thinking at the heart of everything we do and that has become a standard by which he measures the leaders he puts in place to take us there.''</p>
        <p>For all his protestations, many think Mr. Ford never really wanted to be more than a nonexecutive chairman, and in the past he has approached rivals like Dieter Zetsche of DaimlerChrysler about taking a top job at Ford. He has said publicly he is not sure how long he wants to remain chief executive.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, his connection to his company is personal in a way that most modern mercenary chief executives cannot even contemplate: this year, he will take no salary or bonus. His vision for the company is to make Ford a leader in innovation, particularly when it comes to environmental issues. But that remains very much a work in progress for a company that builds some of the industry's largest and least-fuel-efficient vehicles.</p>
        <p>''In my mind, if you're really going to rebuild your company, you've got to do it on both legs,'' Mr. Ford said last month. ''You have to have a sound business, but you have to stand for something and be a leader in something.''</p>
        <p>His advocacy on environmental issues has positioned Ford as the first American company to offer a hybrid electric vehicle comparable to those sold by Toyota and Honda. Last month, he said Ford would increase its hybrid production tenfold by the end of the decade, to about 250,000 vehicles annually.</p>
        <p>The move, which would make hybrids an option on half of the Ford, Lincoln and Mercury models, puts Ford in the best position to compete with Toyota and Honda in offering the technology. And maybe, some say, it will give it an impetus toward becoming a more effective global competitor.</p>
        <p>''Bill Ford understands that to survive, Ford will need to make many more fuel-efficient vehicles,'' said Daniel F. Becker, the Sierra Club's top global warming strategist. ''They've spent the last decade competing against General Motors when they should have been competing against Toyota.''</p>
