        <p>UTILITIES mutual funds are on a tear, returning more than 20 percent, on average, so far this year. But potential investors should take a closer look at those returns, some fund analysts say. Most of this year's best-performing utilities funds loaded up on energy stocks, like those of big integrated oil companies, just as oil prices started to soar.</p>
        <p>For that reason, investors shouldn't expect a repeat performance next year, said Jeff Tjornehoj, a research analyst at Lipper, the mutual fund data company that is based in Denver.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tjornehoj is also a bit wary of utilities funds that invest heavily in oil stocks, he said, because most shareholders probably think of the funds as conservative holdings. ''People invest in utilities because no one's going to stop using electricity,'' he said.</p>
        <p>At least that's the way it used to be. In recent years, the deregulation of many utility markets made this category much more volatile. But ever since the blackouts in California in the summer of 2000 and the huge blackout in the Northeast in the summer of 2003, there has been steady pressure to stiffen regulations in many states.</p>
        <p>Over the past few years, Eaton Vance and Franklin have run the two best-performing utilities funds, according to Morningstar Inc. The Franklin Utilities fund, for example, has had the best return over the last five years, a time when stocks have swung wildly between bull and bear markets and many utilities funds barely broke even; the Franklin fund returned 10.6 percent, annualized, during the period. Over the last three years, the Eaton Vance fund has fared best, returning 11 percent, annualized.</p>
        <p>Despite their similar historical returns, the two funds are managed quite differently. The Eaton Vance fund now holds about 15 percent of its portfolio in energy stocks, including big integrated oil companies, like BP, but the Franklin fund would never buy a big oil stock, because doing so ''really stretches the definition of utilities,'' said the manager, John Kohli. He is only the fourth lead fund manager since the fund started in 1948.</p>
        <p>Franklin Utilities tends to fare better in bear markets, while Eaton Vance Utilities has done better in a bull markets, said David Kathman, a Morningstar fund analyst.</p>
        <p>''Traditional utilities funds like Franklin did better over the last five years, because for most of that time there was a bear market, and conservative stocks did better than telecom and energy,'' Mr. Kathman said. Many less-traditional utilities funds hold energy or telecommunications stocks, including wireless companies.</p>
        <p>At the Franklin fund, Mr. Kohli leans toward companies in states with strong regulatory environments and the potential for energy market growth. He likes traditional power utilities in Georgia and Florida. Over the past year, he has started repurchasing shares of the California power companies PG&amp;E and Southern California Edison.</p>
        <p>The fund eliminated both stocks from its portfolio while the state struggled to revamp its regulations a few years ago. Now California ranks among Mr. Kohli's favorite energy markets. ''Unfortunately PG&amp;E had to go bankrupt to improve the regulation in the state,'' he said.</p>
        <p>About 10 percent of the Franklin portfolio is invested overseas, mostly in British power companies. ''I like the U.K., because they have strong balance sheets, great dividend growth and yields, and the regulatory structure is very similar'' to that of the United States, Mr. Kohli said. The fund doesn't hedge currency, so these holdings would benefit if the dollar declined against the pound.</p>
        <p>Judith A. Saryan, who manages Eaton Vance Utilities, favors companies in lighter regulatory environments. ''I'm willing to pay a bit more for faster growth,'' she said. ''If you're just looking for consistency, my feeling is you could buy a bond.''</p>
        <p>She said she expects oil prices to remain high over the next three years, so she focuses on power companies that would benefit from that trend. For instance, Exelon, based in Chicago, and Entergy, in New Orleans, generate much energy from nuclear power. Production costs aren't rising, but they are able to charge more for this power because fossil fuels are setting energy prices.</p>
        <p>For the same reason, the fund invests in two German power companies, E.On, based in Dusseldorf, and RWE, in Essen. Both companies generate much of their energy from nuclear power and hydropower.</p>
        <p>MS. SARYAN described the fund's second-largest holding, PG&amp;E, as a more regulated company now. However, she thinks shares of PG&amp;E, whose Pacific Gas and Electric unit emerged from bankruptcy in April, are still undervalued.</p>
        <p>Shares of PG&amp;E trade at $34.01, more than 14 times Eaton Vance's earnings estimate of $2.40 a share for 2005. Ms. Saryan said she expects PG&amp;E to be aggressive about cutting costs and buying back shares. She said shares could rise to $35 over the next 12 months, or 14.5 times Eaton Vance's estimate of 2005 earnings.</p>
        <p>One factor in the Eaton Vance fund's performance over the last 12 months -- a return of 31 percent -- has been the fund's stake in integrated oil companies, including BP and Total, the French oil giant. Ms. Sarayan, who called oil stock prices fully valued, said she had been reducing her holdings in that area.</p>
        <p>Generally, investors may now be attracted to utilities for two reasons, said Gary Schatsky, a fee-only financial planner in New York City: they are looking for stability in a challenging market or are dazzled by recent returns. In both cases, he would urge caution. ''Most people who invest in utility funds see the word 'utility' as a proxy for conservative,'' he said. ''The very same factors that made utility funds perform well this year should give them pause.''</p>
        <p>Investors seeking high yield and low volatility should consider bond funds instead, he said. He recommends the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Bond Index fund, with annual expenses of just 0.2 percent and a yield of 4.65 percent. ''If yield matters, then operating expenses definitely matter,'' he said.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, investors who are drawn to the category because of recent performance shouldn't overlook the huge role played by the run-up in energy stocks. If they want to bet on energy stocks now, he said, he would steer them toward a natural resources fund or a pure energy fund.</p>
        <p>Even then, he said, most investors should put no more than 5 percent of their portfolios into an energy or natural resources fund and should first consider their energy stake in equity funds they already own.</p>
        <p>Costs are also a factor, Mr. Schatsky said. Most utilities funds are sold through a broker and carry front-end loads. A do-it-yourself investor may instead want to consider exchange-traded funds. These do not have loads, or sales charges, and generally have lower annual expenses. Investors pay a commission to buy and sell shares, but that can be cheaper if they buy large numbers of shares or hold them a long time. Three E.T.F.'s that hold only utilities stocks are iShares DJ Utilities, Utilities Select Sector SPDR and Vanguard Utilities Vipers.</p>
