        <p>New genetic technologies may someday reshape human life, but they're already reconfiguring decades-old boundaries of partisan politics. This was made clear last week when a broad coalition of environmentalists, feminists and other progressives released an open letter urging the Senate to ban reproductive cloning and to place a moratorium on therapeutic cloning. That position differs radically from legislation sponsored by Senators Ted Kennedy and Dianne Feinstein that would allow medical researchers to proceed with creating cloned embryonic cells. It is arguably closer to the stance of most conservative Republicans, who want a permanent ban on all forms of cloning.</p>
        <p>For the environmentalists, including the heads of Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and the Earth Island Institute and activists and writers like me, this political convergence was in some ways particularly strange. We found ourselves at least temporarily at odds with much of organized science, our usual ally in ecological causes. In this case, medical researchers arguing against restrictions on their search for new cures have been part of a broad campaign for the right to clone embryos.</p>
        <p>Environmental leaders have emphasized the wisdom of going slowly with new technologies. But I think the real fears run much deeper than those pragmatic cautions. Cloning of any kind is a step toward genetic engineering -- toward improving human beings. In other words, toward leaving the natural world behind.</p>
        <p>In that sense, this may turn out to be a pivotal battle for the environmental movement, which started a century ago with the effort to save a few Sierra Nevada canyons. The battle will bring unexpected alliances. Senator Sam Brownback, the Kansas Republican, is the chief sponsor of legislation that would ban all forms of cloning. He also has a record of opposition to environmental legislation. Yet he sounded like a latter-day John Muir on ''Meet the Press'' when he echoed ''the environmental groups'' in their concern ''about the commodification of the human species.''</p>
        <p>Over time, I think this new alignment on issues raised by biotechnology will create a new fissure in American politics. Conservatives may find themselves following the logic of their position in this debate toward more progressive stands on other environmental issues. Already there are diverse religious groups addressing issues like species extinction and global warming. At one rally against sport utility vehicles last spring, a minister held a sign that read, ''What would Jesus drive?''</p>
        <p>Questions concerning the genetic future will not easily divide along our usual political lines. At first glance, one might suppose that defenders of the right to reproductive choice would also defend the right to clone and that pro-life advocates would be sympathetic to the pleas of doctors who say that cloning technology can help them save lives through new cures.</p>
        <p>But the changes engendered by genetic engineering are so far-reaching that they will make the accepted political lineups less relevant. They could force us to reconsider liberalism's faith in the onward march of science as well as force a new recognition that political conservatism shares a common root with conservation.</p>
        <p>Such possibilities, of course, scare the border guards badly. There are already voices on the left excoriating environmentalists and feminists for aligning themselves with conservatives in questioning the use of cloning and urging them to get back to fighting climate change and defending abortion clinics. Conservatives will doubtless feel the heat from libertarians who want no government interference in markets or medicine. Such clashes will remain politically important. But the surge of new technology makes new issues -- and new alliances -- inescapable.</p>
