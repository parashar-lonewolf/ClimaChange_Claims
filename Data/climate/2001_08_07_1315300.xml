        <p>It is the height of summer, and the mosquito is out and about, determined to spoil everyone's good time.</p>
        <p>But for millions of people, including thousands in this country each year, the mosquito is far more than a pest. For them this insect -- a quarter-inch long and weighing a tiny fraction of an ounce -- carries serious disease and sometimes death. Mosquitoes and the malaria they carry may even be the leading impediment to economic growth in the developing world. And, medical science is learning, mosquitoes are full of surprises.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, New Yorkers learned what Dr. Andrew Spielman calls the first law of mosquitoes: expect the unexpected.</p>
        <p>Until August 1999, most city residents found mosquitoes but occasional summertime pests, to be endured perhaps at an evening concert in Central Park. Then came the news that, somehow or other, a native mosquito, Culex pipiens, the so-called common house mosquito that hangs out in storm sewers and sump pumps but rarely bites people, had acquired an exotic virus that could cause a fatal brain infection, West Nile encephalitis. The virus, named for its discovery in 1937 in the blood of a feverish woman in the West Nile district of Uganda, had never before been seen on this side of the Atlantic.</p>
        <p>But how had the West Nile virus arrived on these shores? Did it enter by way of an infected traveler, by infected mosquitoes that hitched a ride on a plane or ship? Epidemiologists worry it is but the first of many exotic viruses that could use local mosquito species as an incubator and transport system for infecting countless people in the United States.</p>
        <p>''It's amazing that it happened, and it may happen again and again,'' said Dr. Spielman, a Harvard professor and an expert on mosquito-borne illness. With the journalist Michael D'Antonio, Dr. Spielman has written a new book on the subject of his life's work, ''Mosquito: A Natural History of Our Most Persistent and Deadly Foe.''</p>
        <p>''There are other viruses out there -- Rift Valley fever virus, Japanese B encephalitis virus, among them -- that could be imported,'' said Dr. Spielman, 70.</p>
        <p>''However,'' he said in an interview, ''there's no need to reach overseas for exotic viruses transmitted by mosquitoes. There's an enormous number of viruses here now that could bridge from animals to humans via the mosquito.''</p>
        <p>The 2,500 known species of mosquitoes (150 of them in the United States) cover the gamut of ecological niches and bite at all times of the day and night. Some, like Aedes aegypti, a transmitter of deadly dengue fever in Puerto Rico, reside in or near people's homes, making mass eradication by communitywide spraying a virtual impossibility. Aedes mcintoshi, a vector of Rift Valley fever virus, which has caused huge outbreaks in the Middle East, can survive in its egg stage for decades in a dessicated desert, hatching when it rains.</p>
        <p>C. pipiens, the mosquito that is host to West Nile in New York, seeks its blood meal in the evening. Dr. Spielman said, ''It is the mosquito in built-up areas, but it rarely bites people.'' He has encountered it covering the walls of an African hut like a living carpet, as well as in Paris's subway, the Ginza shopping district of Tokyo and Confucius' graveyard in China.</p>
        <p>Like other mosquito species, the female C. pipiens (only females bite) needs just one mating to acquire sufficient sperm to lay two batches of eggs. Each batch consists of about 240 eggs that form a canoe-shaped raft the size of a rice grain.</p>
        <p>The eggs are deposited in any available water -- children's pools, trays under flower pots, birdbaths and storm sewers -- and take a week or so to go to larva to pupa to adult. The females bite almost anything to get the blood they need to support egg development. In the process they can acquire, incubate and then transfer several potentially deadly viruses.</p>
        <p>In the New York area, the West Nile virus has been isolated from thousands of birds, both wild and zoo-dwelling, as well as from horses, cats, bats, chipmunks, skunks, squirrels, domestic rabbits and raccoons. It has spread along the East Coast from Maine to Florida, and as far west as Ohio.</p>
        <p>Experts predict it will take a few summers at most for this viral import to invade most developed areas in the United States. While healthy children and younger adults typically get only a mild infection, the virus can be devastating in the elderly and chronically ill, especially people with diabetes. In its first appearance in New York in August and September 1999, about 60 patients, with an average age of 71, were hospitalized with a documented West Nile infection. Most had signs of encephalitis, and seven died. There were 21 cases, with two deaths, in the nation in 2000. This year, two human cases have been reported, both in Florida.</p>
        <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta reports that for every one person with an obvious West Nile infection, four others have a subclinical illness that goes undetected. The virus multiplies in and often kills birds, the so-called amplifying hosts, and multiplies further in mosquitoes that take blood from birds.</p>
        <p>But West Nile is far from the worst mosquito-borne infection now in this hemisphere. Dengue fever, relatively unknown in the West until the 1970's, when an epidemic swept through Cuba and other Caribbean countries, produces a spectrum of symptoms, the worst of which is fatal hemorrhagic fever. Aedes aegypti, a daytime biter that prefers human blood, is the principal vector of yellow fever as well as dengue. Dengue is primarily a disease of the tropics, though it threatens to invade the American South.</p>
        <p>In Puerto Rico, Dr. Spielman reports, the mosquito that transmits dengue can be found ''virtually everywhere on the island, including in a flower vase in my San Juan hotel room during a meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.'' At least one person attending the meeting was stricken.</p>
        <p>Some experts believe dengue is fast becoming a plague of worldwide dimensions that with global warming may one day eclipse malaria as the most important mosquito-borne illness in people. Now, malaria claims two million lives a year, plus an enormous cost in lost productivity among those who become infected and ill but do not die. It is transmitted by the nighttime bite of an Anopheles mosquito, which threatens about 40 percent of the world's population.</p>
        <p>In this country, West Nile is not the only form of mosquito-borne encephalitis that threatens people. Every summer, about 120 people are stricken with St. Louis encephalitis, a brain infection transmitted by C. pipiens, the West Nile vector. The virus can survive the winter in blood-gorged females that take refuge in barns, caves and other protected places. About 15 percent of victims die, and some survivors suffer lasting emotional disturbances.</p>
        <p>La Crosse encephalitis, named for the Wisconsin city where it was discovered in the 1960's in a child who died, now occurs widely across the country. It is spread by a late-afternoon biter, Aedes triseriatus, a woodland dweller that breeds in water-filled tree holes and old tires.</p>
        <p>The virus can be transmitted from the mother mosquito to her eggs, so no animal host is needed to perpetuate it. Nearly all victims of La Crosse encephalitis are children under 15, and 90 percent are males. One in 25 who are infected develop encephalitis, and 1 percent die.</p>
        <p>Western equine encephalitis, spread by Culex tarsalis in the Western states, also can cause serious illness, especially in children. But here the risk of developing encephalitis from an infected bite is only one in a thousand, with a death rate of 5 percent.</p>
        <p>The deadliest mosquito-borne viral infection is Eastern equine encephalitis, a disease of the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts that can strike people of all ages with a mortality rate of 30 percent to 50 percent. Fortunately, it is still rare, and it is likely to remain so. The virus infects birds that roost near freshwater swamps, where the swamp mosquito Culiseta melanura dwells. But this insect almost never bites people. Rather, people acquire the disease when some other mosquito, known as a bridge vector, bites an infected bird and then bites a person.</p>
        <p>The most feared mosquito these days, the aggressive Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is unlikely to cause more than an annoying, itchy bite. Although it carries disease in Asia, this pest, which arrived here in the 1960's in tire shipments from Japan, ''is willing to feed on almost anything,'' and that willingness invalidates it as a host for infection, Dr. Spielman said. ''Since the female mosquito usually feeds on blood only twice,'' he said, ''if it bites the wrong host where the virus cannot multiply, it's a dead end.''</p>
        <p>It is perhaps of little consolation to know four facts about mosquitoes: the most common biter here, the well-named warm weather mosquito, Aedes vexans, along with A. excrucians of the northern woods and A. tormentor of the southern woods, are at worst bridge vectors; mosquitoes cannot transmit the AIDS virus; human blood is usually inferior to that from other animals for fostering mosquito egg development, and for many mosquito-borne viruses people are dead-end hosts.</p>
        <p>This last fact means that viruses cannot multiply adequately in human blood to infect the next mosquito that bites. Thus, it is unlikely that a disease like West Nile arrived here via an infected person traveling from an endemic area, according to Dr. Kenneth L. Tyler of the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver.</p>
        <p>In an editorial in June in The New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Tyler urged his fellow physicians to ''remain alert for new outbreaks of disease in animals, which may herald related events in humans.''</p>
        <p>Do mosquitoes have a saving grace? Not according to Dr. Spielman, who said he knew of no species of plant or animal that was completely dependent upon the mosquito for survival. True, nectar-feeding male and female mosquitoes help to pollinate some flowers, and mosquito larvae and adults are fare for fish, frogs, bats, birds, dragonflies and other insects. But all would survive if suddenly every mosquito were to disappear from the face of the earth, not that this is likely to happen soon enough for people who have already lost a pint of blood this summer to mosquitoes that hatched after the spring floods in the South and Midwest.</p>
