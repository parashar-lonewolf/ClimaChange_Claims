        <p>Settling years of regional political disputes, House and Senate negotiators reached final agreement today on changes in clean air legislation that are intended to strengthen and broaden the Government's authority to reduce air pollution. The amendments are the first in 13 years.</p>
        <p>Lawmakers hailed what they characterized as a breakthrough in setting stricter standards and in establishing new timetables for sharply cutting chemical contamination in the air.

        <p>Settling years of regional political disputes, House and Senate negotiators reached final agreement today on changes in clean air legislation that are intended to strengthen and broaden the Government's authority to reduce air pollution. The amendments are the first in 13 years.</p>
        <p>Lawmakers hailed what they characterized as a breakthrough in setting stricter standards and in establishing new timetables for sharply cutting chemical contamination in the air. But many also agreed with environmental leaders that the problem is so vast and the required improvements so expensive that the nation is not likely to breathe much cleaner air until the first decade of the 21st century.</p>
        <p>Cost for Industry</p>
        <p>The agreement puts costly new burdens on industry, the Environmental Protection Agency, state environmental agencies and consumers. New equipment would be required for automobiles, possibly adding $500 to the cost of a new car. And the costs of dry cleaning, paint, steel and electricity could also increase.</p>
        <p>Some economists have estimated that compliance could cost $25 billion to $35 billion a year. But environmentalists contend that without the changes, the toll on public health and the environment would result in even greater costs.</p>
        <p>Leading industrial groups, including a coalition of companies and industries that has played an influential role in shaping the present form of the legislation and warding off tougher provisions, said they supported the new amendments. Bush's Approval Expected</p>
        <p>The bill now goes to the House and Senate, which are both expected to approve it later this week.  President Bush is expected to approve final legislation.</p>
        <p>Stephen Hart, a spokesman for the White House, said, "We are encouraged by the progress in the conference and we're waiting the see the final language."</p>
        <p>Important provisions include stopping over the next 10 years the production of chemicals that destroy the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere, tighter restrictions on the pollution that causes urban smog, stricter regulations on automobile exhausts starting in the model year 1994, new limits on emissions of cancer-causing compounds by factories and chemical plants by 2003, and new limits on coal-burning power plants that will nearly cut in half emissions of the chemical compounds sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, which cause acid rain.</p>
        <p>The negotiators also established a $250 million program to compensate workers who may lose their jobs over the next five years as companies begin to comply with the legislation. Members of the House had proposed the program to aid coal miners, chemical workers and others. 'Comprehensive and Sweeping'</p>
        <p>"The agreement is without doubt one of the most comprehensive and sweeping environmental laws that Congress has passed in this century," said Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who was chairman of the House-Senate conference committee. "It will end a long and bitter 10-year battle over Federal clean air policy."</p>
        <p>Originally approved in 1970, the Clean Air Act has been one of the foundations of state and Federal programs to control pollution. Since 1977, when it was last amended, attempts to revise and strengthen the law were repeatedly foiled by rancorous regional disputes over the costs of new regulations, the number of jobs that might be lost in industries that would be affected and the extent of damage to public health and the environment caused by dirty air.</p>
        <p>At a news conference today, Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, the Senate Republican whip and one of the negotiators, said: "It's a good piece of work. The President will sign it. I'm positive."</p>
        <p>Led by Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic leader who first proposed legislation to control acid rain nine years ago, the Senate passed its version of the clean air legislation on April 3. In the House, Representatives John D. Dingell of Michigan and Henry A. Waxman of California, both Democrats, pushed a differing version of the legislation. The House vote of approval came on May 23.</p>
        <p>Negotiators began meeting to resolve the differences between the two bills on July 13. Accord Reached Before Dawn</p>
        <p>The final agreement was reached before dawn today and celebrated by the negotiators and their staffs with champagne. The negotiators today credited President Bush with breaking the impasse last year by proposing a package of new amendments, including one reducing emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide.</p>
        <p>"You should have been there," Senator Simpson said of the negotiations. "It was rich, profane, embittered. I learned that Henry Waxman is tougher than a boiled owl."</p>
        <p>The final agreement will push the Environmental Protection Agency to the limits of its technical and managerial abilities. The agency will be charged with writing and enforcing hundreds of new standards, regulations and rules.</p>
        <p>Three offices at the agency's headquarters in Washington, employing about 640 people, will handle all the work the legislation calls for, including setting new limits on toxic chemical emissions from industrial plants and new standards for automobile emissions and reviewing the quality of plans by cities to reduce urban smog.</p>
        <p>In addition, state environmental agencies will also need to prepare new studies of pollution in cities and regions to meet the requirements of the legislation.</p>
        <p>The Bush Administration requested an increase of $52 million in the 1991 fiscal year to enable the Federal environmental agency to hire 190 more technical experts for the Clean Air program, and $38 million for grants to help state and city environmental agencies meet the new requirements.</p>
        <p>"By and large the air doesn't get clean by passing this law," said David D. Doniger, a senior lawyer in Washington for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group based in New York. "It gets clean by the E.P.A.  and states carrying out the new law." Weak Record Noted</p>
        <p>Representative Waxman was one of several lawmakers who noted today the Federal environmental agency's weak record in managing complex programs over the last 10 to 15 years. Programs to regulate unsafe pesticides and to clean up hazardous waste dumps have been marred by delays. Mr. Waxman said the negotiators sought to avoid unnecessary delays in implementing the new clean air amendments by establishing specific limits in the legislation for the worst pollutants.</p>
        <p>The rules for controlling acid rain, for instance, which are intended to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide 12 million to 14 million tons annually by the end of the decade, call for 111 individual plants in 22 states to reduce emissions to specific levels by Jan. 1, 1995, and all utilities to meet an even stricter standard by the year 2000.</p>
        <p>"The air is going to be significantly cleaner 10 years from now than it is today, thanks to this bill," said Daniel Weiss, director of the Sierra Club's environmental quality program in Washington. "Some provisions may be delayed longer than we would like to see, but there is no question this is a major step forward."</p>
        <p>New York City's environmental officials said they were dissatisfied with the motor vehicle provisions that emerged from the conference committee.</p>
        <p>"New York City's worst air problem is caused by automobiles and the bottom line of the Clean Air Act is: automobiles, one; clean air, nothing," said Albert F. Appleton, the city's Environmental Protection Commissioner.</p>
        <p>Mr. Appleton said Congress did not go far enough in restricting tailpipe emissions and in allowing New York to participate in a California program that requires cleaner-burning fuels. He also said he was concerned about the delays in tightening emissions standards for urban buses and delays in forcing fleets of trucks to use cleaner-burning fuels.</p>
        <p>Thomas C. Jorling, New York State's Environmental Conservation Commissioner, said that the Clean Air Act had been improved "across the board," but that he also felt the negotiators did not go far enough. Effect on Du Pont</p>
        <p>Perhaps no company in the United States will be more affected by the new legislation than E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company, the nation's largest chemical company based in Wilmington, Del. Du Pont, which had revenues last year of $35 billion, is a major producer of chlorofluorocarbons, the refrigerant and cleaning solvent that destroys the ozone shield that protects the earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. Chlorofluorcarbons would be phased out in the 1990's and banned in 2000.</p>
        <p>The company also owns Consolidation Coal in Pittsburgh, an important producer of coal that contains high levels of sulfur. The new rules for reducing sulfur emissions from utilities could reduce orders for that kind of coal. Many utilities may switch to cleaner burning coal mined in the West. To soften the blow, provisions in the new bill provide economic incentives for utilities to install scrubbers that would enable them to burn coal with high concentrations of sulfur.</p>
        <p>All of Du Pont's chemical plants would be affected by new rules requiring permits for all sources of atmospheric pollution and by regulations to reduce emissions of 189 chemicals that the Government says cause cancer, birth defects and other medical problems.</p>
        <p>Du Pont's oil company, Conoco Inc., is also likely to be an important supplier of new types of gasoline that burn more cleanly. 'Something We Can Live With'</p>
        <p>Mark Nelson, the company's director of legislative affairs in Washington, said Du Pont supports the bill. He said the company has not yet determined the cost of meeting the new requirements.</p>
        <p>"This looks like a tough bill, but it's something we can live with," Mr. Nelson said.</p>
        <p>A representative from the automobile industry said auto makers also supported the amendments.</p>
        <p>"We're part of the problem; we want to be part of the solution," said Timothy C. MacCarthy, director of the Federal liaison department at the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association in Washington. "Only time will tell whether the significant costs match up with the benefits of this bill."</p>
