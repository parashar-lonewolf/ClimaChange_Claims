        <p>LEAD: In August 1988, Thomas Lovejoy, a biologist for the Smithsonian Institution, offered a chilling prediction to the American Institute of Biological Sciences:</p>
        <p>In August 1988, Thomas Lovejoy, a biologist for the Smithsonian Institution, offered a chilling prediction to the American Institute of Biological Sciences:</p>
        <p>''I am utterly convinced that most of the great environmental struggles will be either won or lost in the 1990's. And that by the next century it will be too late.''</p>
        <p>Was anybody listening? Did anybody hear?</p>
        <p>It would be hard to show that many outside the world of environmental expertise - where Mr. Lovejoy's conclusion is widely shared - look to the 90's as a decade of decision. But those attending a recent conference in New Delhi on global warming must have been feeling some of the same urgency he expressed.</p>
        <p>These scientists, environmental authorities and government officials were mostly representatives of the third world. Predictably enough, and properly, they urged the industrialized nations to impose restrictive taxes on the use of gasoline and other fossil fuels, which make the heaviest - but most correctable -contribution to global warming. Not so expectable was the emphasis at the conference on the need for all nations, developing as well as developed, to increase energy efficiency, expand forest cover and curb population expansion - a particularly important subject in the third world.</p>
        <p>''We cannot sit on the sidelines anymore,'' said M. S. Swaminathan, president of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. This was tacit recognition that though the industrialized world is a major environmental offender - in carbon emissions from automobiles, for example - the third world not only suffers the consequences but causes some itself: notably the destruction of forests, and population growth rates too high for the planet to sustain.</p>
        <p>George Woodwell of the Woods Hole Research Center reciprocated with the admission that the United States had not ''put its own house in order.'' Indeed not; Mr. Woodwell may not have known when he spoke that the move toward energy efficiency has slowed and stopped in the U.S., following the drop in oil prices in 1986. Energy efficiency - the ratio of energy used to goods and services produced - rose by 24 percent from 1976 to 1986, but thanks partially to a renewed American demand for gas-guzzling cars, it failed to increase in 1987 and retrogressed in 1988.</p>
        <p>The New Delhi conference followed closely on the release of the 1989 State of the World report from the Worldwatch Institute, in which global warming was one topic of much concern. In a summary chapter outlining a ''global action plan,'' the authors -Lester Brown, Christopher Flavin and Sandra Postel - warn that no ''quick fixes'' are available to prevent global warming - which endangers ''food production, water supplies, forest products industries and fisheries'' within ''the next several decades.''</p>
        <p>The authors discount nuclear energy as a ''practical response,'' owing to its increasing expense and safety problems, and the lack of acceptable means of radioactive waste disposal. In their judgment, the needed global action to cope with global warming must therefore concentrate on improving energy efficiency and developing ''renewable'' energy sources.</p>
        <p>Improved energy efficiency is the most promising approach. The nearly 400 million automobiles in the world today emit about 547 million tons of carbon into the atmosphere annually; by 2010, if nothing is done, these emissions will nearly double, greatly hastening global warming. But if by that year there are no more than 500 million cars on the roads, averaging 50 miles per gallon instead of 20, carbon emissions from auto exhausts could be cut in half, to 274 million tons a year.</p>
        <p>Even greater gains could be made by switching from coal-fired energy production to natural-gas-fired steam injection turbines. Over all, today's 5.5 billion tons of annual carbon emissions from fossil fuel use will rise to 10 billion tons by 2010 if it grows at just 3 percent a year. Efficiency improvements alone can cut that growth by three billion tons.</p>
        <p>These examples only confirm that, on the problem of global warming, a ''fundamental reordering of national energy priorities'' will be necessary in the next decade. And that is only one of the environmental problems that pose a far more immediate threat to life on this planet than a nuclear holocaust.</p>
        <p>But is anyone listening? Has anyone heard?</p>
