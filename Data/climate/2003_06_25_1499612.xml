        <p>An array of industrialized and developing countries agreed today on the outline of a cooperative research program aimed at capturing and storing carbon dioxide, the main smokestack emission linked to global warming.</p>
        <p>The agreement came halfway through a three-day conference in McLean, Va., organized by the Bush administration, which has argued for more than a year that a technological breakthrough will be needed to stabilize levels of so-called greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>A buildup of those gases has been blamed by many scientists for most of a 50-year warming trend that could raise sea levels and disrupt climate patterns if emissions are not reduced. Most industrialized countries have ratified the Kyoto Protocol, a binding treaty that would require reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases. It awaits ratification by Russia to take effect.</p>
        <p>The Bush administration has rejected that approach, saying climate science remains too uncertain to justify mandatory measures. It favors voluntary programs for curbing growth in the gases and long-term research on new nonpolluting energy sources or ways to sop up emissions from the burning of fossil fuels like oil, natural gas and coal.</p>
        <p>''Regardless of what target you choose,'' Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said, ''no goal is going to be achieved unless we develop the new technologies to get there.''</p>
        <p>One justification for pursuing that approach, administration officials and independent experts at the meeting said, is a projection that 90 percent of the increased demand for electricity worldwide in the next half-century will be met by burning fossil fuels. The administration wants to find ways to continue using coal, which remains plentiful and cheap, without adding to the atmosphere's burden of greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>At the meeting, officials from the United States, the European Union, Canada, Australia, Russia, Japan, China, India and several other countries said they planned to sign a charter on Thursday under which they would coordinate research projects on the process, called carbon sequestration.</p>
        <p>Energy experts from private environmental groups who attended the conference said that devising such techniques was important, but added that without binding limits on emissions, there would be no impetus for power generators to use modernized equipment.</p>
