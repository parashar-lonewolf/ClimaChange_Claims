        <p>LEAD: Industry opponents of legislation to control acid rain were the champion spenders among Capitol Hill lobbyists in 1986.</p>
        <p>Industry opponents of legislation to control acid rain were the champion spenders among Capitol Hill lobbyists in 1986.</p>
        <p>The Citizens for Sensible Control of Acid Rain said its lobbying costs totaled $3,028,235, the biggest single segment of the nearly $60.9 million that individuals and groups said they spent while trying to influence Congress.</p>
        <p>The organization, financed largely by electricity and coal companies, paid out most of the money for mass mailings intended to prompt citizens to tell lawmakers that they oppose mandating stricter emission controls on coal-burning boilers.</p>
        <p>After spending nothing in the first three months of 1986, the lobby began moving quickly after about 160 House members became co-sponsors of a bill to control acid rain drafted by two Democratic Representatives, Gerry Sikorski of Minnesota and Henry A. Waxman of California.</p>
        <p>The legislation was approved at midyear by the Subcommittee on Health and the Environment but eventually died in the full Committee on Energy and Commerce. In the Senate, an acid rain bill never came up for a committee vote. Benefits Group Is Second</p>
        <p>In second place among lobbyists last year, with an outlay of $3,011,412, was another mass-mail operation, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.</p>
        <p>Some members of Congress close to these issues have accused this group of using scare tactics to get senior citizens to contribute to its operations, which last year sent Capitol Hill an estimated eight million pieces of correspondence.</p>
        <p>Both the Social Security and the acid rain lobbyists surpassed the previous high in spending, $2,087,586 by the Natural Gas Supply Association in 1984.</p>
        <p>The aggregate lobbyist spending of $60,869,183, compiled by The Associated Press from reports filed with the House clerk and Senate secretary, was almost 25 percent higher than the total that lobbyists spent in 1985 and nearly 45 percent above 1984 levels.</p>
        <p>According to the required spending reports, little of the lobbying money is spent directly on lawmakers. Much of it goes for staff salaries, to hire lawyers to visit Congressional offices and to pay office overhead.</p>
        <p>An increasing amount is used to turn the American public into long-distance lobbyists through mail campaigns intended to get people to flood Congress with printed correspondence carrying an interest group's message. Record Aggregate Outlay</p>
        <p>Last year's aggregate outlay of $60,869,183 was the highest since The Associated Press began compiling such totals in 1983. It was $11.85 million above the previous high of 1985, when work began on the new tax law.</p>
        <p>Nine organizations reported spending more than $1 million each on lobbying last year, two more than 1985 and four more than 1984.</p>
        <p>As the outlays rose, so did the number of registered lobbyists. There were about 6,000 at the start of 1985, climbing to 8,000 by the middle of 1986. Today the House clerk puts the number at 8,512.</p>
        <p>The No. 3 spender last year, with $2,074,807, was Common Cause, described as a citizens' lobby, which concentrates on issues such as campaign financing and political ethics. It said its spending represented its entire budget.</p>
        <p>Other groups spending more than $1 million were the National Association of Letter Carriers, $1,633,716; Fiber, Fabric and Apparel Coalition for Trade, $1,482,349; Committee to Protect the Family, $1,469,866; American Council of Life Insurance, $1,119,881; Sierra Club, $1,059,721, and Handgun Control Inc., $1,002,522.</p>
        <p>This last-named anti-firearms organization, however, was outspent as usual by the collective outlays of its three main foes: Gun Owners of America, $981,500; National Rifle Association of America, $904,895, and Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, $417,625.</p>
        <p>Among the other big spenders of 1986 were the American Petroleum Institute, $917,515; Communications Management Inc. for Philip Morris USA, $883,842; Association for a Better New York, $785,574; Free the Eagle, $783,234, and Gilbert Keyes, for the Boeing Aerospace Company, $746,229.</p>
        <p>Also, Blue Cross-Blue Shield Association, $673,877; U.S. League of Savings Institutions, $654,991; Project Cure, $635,607; Audio Recording Rights Coalition, $622,979; National Association of Realtors, $561,118; Coalition Against Double Taxation, $560,258, and Railway Labor Executives' Association, $554,956;</p>
