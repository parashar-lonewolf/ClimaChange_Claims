        <p>SCIENTISTS have discovered a previously unsuspected spring-time blossoming of algae in the Greenland Sea, raising new questions about the workings of the global carbon cycle, a primary governor of global climate.</p>
        <p>Carbon dioxide, which traps heat in the atmosphere and helps regulate the planet's surface temperature, is constantly being exchanged between the atmosphere, on one hand, and the oceans and terrestrial plants on the other. The more algae and land plants there are to absorb carbon dioxide, the less of it stays in the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Scientists say that for a better approach to the question of global warming, it is important to know where carbon flows through this system and at what rates. Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are steadily rising as a result of automobile exhausts and industrial processes; many climatologists believe this will ultimately warm the climate.</p>
        <p>Scientists have believed that the major ocean repository, or sink, for carbon dioxide is in the Southern Hemisphere and that terrestrial plants are the most important sink in the Northern Hemisphere. The Greenland Sea findings call that belief into question, says Dr. Walker O. Smith Jr., an oceanographer at the University of Tennessee.</p>
        <p>Dr. Smith and colleagues discovered what they describe as a "massive bloom" of algae in the Fram Strait between Greenland and Spitsbergen in April and early May 1989.  They calculated that the algae produced an average of 40 grams of carbon per square meter, the carbon having been absorbed from the atmosphere. Previous studies had found carbon production by algae in the study area to be much lower. The new findings appear in the current issue of the British journal Nature.</p>
        <p>It is possible that earlier estimates were too low because of undersampling, the authors say. If so, they wrote, then the relative importance of land plants and ocean algae as carbon sinks in the Northern Hemisphere cannot be determined until further studies are done.</p>
        <p>The Fram Strait is especially important to the global flow of carbon because it is where surface currents meet colder polar waters, cool and sink to the bottom, taking any newly captured atmospheric carbon with it.</p>
        <p>The question raised by the new findings is "something we need to address in a very rigorous fashion if we are going to respond to global warming," said Dr. Smith.</p>
