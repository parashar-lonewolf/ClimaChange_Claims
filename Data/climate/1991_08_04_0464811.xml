        <p>National 20-36</p>
        <p>Weapons makers and the military face smaller budgets, but the change may not be as severe for the economy as was feared. While the initial jolt has been difficult, most are finding ways to adapt. 1</p>
        <p>A $291 billion military budget bill was approved by the Senate late Friday that adapts only slightly to improved United States-Soviet relations by continuing to increase the nation's strategic weaponry. 35</p>

        <p>A woman who is dying from AIDS contracted because of careless health workers has sent President Bush a letter pleading compassion for AIDS victims and arguing against screening doctors for the disease. 1</p>
        <p>The mask that hid Jeffrey Dahmer, the Milwaukee man who confessed to a horrific string of slayings, was one of a normal young man. But the mask slipped as he drank, turned violent or cried out for attention. 1</p>
