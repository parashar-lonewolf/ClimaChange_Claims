        <p>Here are glimpses of some of the victims of the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center.</p>
        <p>RODNEY J. WOTTON  A Death, and a New Life</p>
        <p>Patricia Greene-Wotton is planning a memorial service and a baptism. Her husband, Rodney J. Wotton, disappeared in the attacks on Sept. 11, and their son, Rodney Patrick, was born eight days later.</p>
        <p>''It's like death and resurrection,'' she said. ''The baptism was to have been a happy occasion, but it's a sad thing knowing that Rod will not be there for the baby's baptism.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wotton, 36, who worked at Fiduciary Trust, never found out whether his child was a girl or a boy. At the couple's request, the doctor who performed the sonogram wrote the sex on a piece of paper and sealed it in an envelope. Meanwhile, the Wottons picked names for a girl and a boy: Amanda Helga and Brendan Stewart. Now, the baby is named for his missing father.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wotton loved children. He had a daughter, Dorothea Jean, 2, whom he loved to bathe and tuck in at night. Five years ago, he and his wife looked at 65 houses before settling on a ranch-style home on two acres in Middletown, N.J.</p>
        <p>''It's our dream house,'' she said. ''It has a big yard that we thought would be nice for the children. It has a big garden that he put in because he loved gardening. A couple of weeks ago, I gave Dorothea watermelon that her dad grew. She loved it.''</p>
        <p>CARRIE PROGEN  Telling Sketches of Strangers</p>
        <p>As the A train gently rocked her, Carrie Progen would sit with a small pad in her lap and sketch hurried portraits of the commuters sitting and standing around her in silence. These fleeting moments were among life's truest, she told her boyfriend, Erik P. Sharkey, ''the moments when New Yorkers were thinking the most.''</p>
        <p>In all, she filled four notebooks with sketches that seemed to reveal the thoughts of strangers. But they also reflected a young artist's passion for her adopted city, Mr. Sharkey said. ''The one thing, if you could, is to say how much she loved New York.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Progen, 25, came from Ashburnham, Mass., where she celebrated her high school graduation by getting a Celtic-style tattoo. ''The correct terminology for Carrie is free-spirited,'' recalled her mother, Kathleen.</p>
        <p>Ms. Progen, who lived with Mr. Sharkey in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, was an administrative assistant at the Aon Corporation. But her passion was her art, including illustrations she had just completed for a children's book about ''two parents trying to find their little girl who's hiding from them,'' he said.</p>
        <p>An exhibit of her artwork -- including her subway sketches -- is to be held at 8 p.m. on Nov. 17 in Manhattan at Anderson's Martial Arts Academy, 35 West 31st Street.</p>
        <p>MARTIN MORALES  An American Dream</p>
        <p>Martin Morales moved from a small Mexican village to New York City three years ago, seeking the storybook American life. Living in a cramped basement apartment with a half-dozen relatives in Elmhurst, Queens, he scoured Spanish-speaking newspapers for jobs, working here and there until about a year ago, when he landed a job as an assistant chef at Windows on the World, said his brother, Gonzalo Morales.</p>
        <p>The picturesque views of Lady Liberty and Governors Island allowed Martin Morales, 22, to reflect daily on the mission ahead of him. He wanted to learn English and earn enough money to build a house in the countryside back home, his brother said.</p>
        <p>His 9-year-old niece, Diana Narvaiz, said she will miss playing soccer with her uncle and his sense of humor. ''He would always say he was going to Mexico,'' she said. ''It was funny because he was really going to work or the store.''</p>
        <p>FRANK MANCINI  They Loved Him in Astoria</p>
        <p>It seemed as if everyone in Astoria knew Frank Mancini. He might as well have been living in a Greek or an Italian village instead of the big city of New York.</p>
        <p>He met his future wife, Anastasia, in first grade at Public School 17 in Queens. They went to the prom at Long Island City High School. By the time they were married on May 21, 2000, they considered it their 10th anniversary -- of dating. Frank was Spanish and Italian. Anastasia was Greek. They went to Mykonos for their honeymoon. Six feet tall, red-haired, riding a motorcycle and laughing, he stood out.</p>
        <p>''Everybody loved Frankie in Astoria,'' said his doting mother, Lea. ''Frankie was No. 1.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mancini, 26, had been a laborer with Local 79, his dad's union, since he was 18. When his father retired, Frank continued working construction at the World Trade Center, the only job he had ever known. About two weeks before the plane hit the north tower, he had moved from the basement to the 107th floor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mancini couldn't wait to take his 3-month-old daughter, Sophia, to Disney World. ''How old does she have to be?'' he asked his wife. ''I think we should wait till she's 3 or 4, at least,'' Anastasia said. He was also planning her wedding.</p>
        <p>ADAM WHITE  Days Filled With Surprises</p>
        <p>Growing up in Atlanta, Adam White was like an electron zinging through an always-interesting orbit, or maybe several orbits at once. ''He was an exhausting child,'' said his stepmother, Georgia, who joined the family when Adam was 4. And also a charming one, who packed more into his waking hours than anyone she knew.</p>
        <p>He loved surprises and drama and being the star of the show. When his high school put on a production of ''Amadeus,'' he landed the role of Mozart, playing all the piano passages himself. He had hundreds of friends, scattered all over the world, and dozens of interests, like mountain climbing and traveling and oratory, into which he poured his heart.</p>
        <p>Adult life took him to San Francisco, and then to New York, where Mr. White, 26, was developing an electronic trading program in carbon dioxide for Cantor Fitzgerald. ''The bigger the city, the better for him,'' Mrs. White said. ''His brothers used to go and visit him, wherever he was, and say afterwards that they felt like they had been there for a month when it had only been a few days.</p>
        <p>''His dad went up to visit him in New York for a weekend last year, and when he got back he had to rest for a couple of days before he could go back to work. Everything was so exciting with Adam.''</p>
        <p>MICHELE COYLE-EULAU  A Maximum Mom</p>
        <p>''Michele, it's 11 o'clock!'' Dennis Eulau would shout. ''Could you just come to bed?''</p>
        <p>After all, her day had started at 5 a.m., with the NordicTrack workout, then the frenzy to roust, dress and feed their three little guys -- ages 2, 5 and 7 -- and get herself to work, two days a week in the city and one at home, as a systems analyst at Marsh &amp; McLennan. On city days, she arrived early so she could jam in a lot and leave on the dot.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Coyle-Eulau, 38, would go home to Garden City, N.Y., dine on cereal, then supervise the boys' homework and bedtime rituals. Then she would plan weekends. A skier and snorkeler, she was the one who pushed everyone out the door for activities.</p>
        <p>She was a to-the-max mom. A coach from an opposing soccer team asked her to tone down the cheering. Before school started, she would seek out teachers, demanding, ''What can you do for my boys?''</p>
        <p>Here is what the boys did for her: last Mother's Day, they cooked pancakes with red and blue food coloring. She even ate them.</p>
        <p>What took her so long to get to bed? Packing lunches, making grocery lists, arranging play dates. ''I never understood,'' her husband said. ''Now I do.''</p>
        <p>IRA ZASLOW  A Passion for Paddleball</p>
        <p>The closer it got to Saturday, the more excited Ira Zaslow would become. At 55, a financial analyst for Lehman Brothers, he was like a boy about the weekend. He would call Bryan, his eldest son, to say: ''This weekend is going to be great!''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Zaslow, weekends meant paddleball. ''He had a passion for it,'' said Bryan Zaslow. ''It was pure happiness for him to wake up at 6 on Saturdays and Sundays and meet the same paddleball friends. He went anywhere to play.'' An argument over a foul ball? Play it over, he would say. ''Anything,'' Bryan Zaslow said, ''to play more.''</p>
        <p>His other passions were equally homey: A good nap on the couch. Listening to the car radio while Felicia, his wife of 31 years, shopped at the mall. The pizza at a place in North Woodmere, his Long Island hometown.</p>
        <p>A quiet man, he went out of his way to lend a hand, while deflecting the credit. When New York University rejected a young Lehman employee, he made a call or two and got her in. Then he congratulated her. ''He had time for everybody,'' his son said. '' 'Whatever you want,' he'd say.''</p>
        <p>MICHAEL PARKES  He Just Wanted to Help</p>
        <p>At first, the personnel director at Marsh &amp; McLennan thought Michael Parkes had -- to put it gently -- embellished his job application. A scoutmaster? A leader of a church youth group? A volunteer camp counselor? A member of the church managing committee? Please.</p>
        <p>''They said, 'You don't have to say these things to get a job here,' '' said Stanley Edme, a friend who roomed with him at New York University. '' 'We're going to check these things out, you know.' ''</p>
        <p>Turned out that Mr. Parkes, 27, was telling the truth. He worked as an accountant, but his goal was to help young people on a grand scale -- to guide young black men into top colleges and corporations and teach them true friendship. Among his friends, he was the diplomat, the mediator. ''When you talked to him,'' Mr. Edme said, ''you felt stronger and taller. He'd have been a great politician.''</p>
        <p>But his heart was with the Episcopal Church, said his twin sister, Monique. ''We thought he'd be a bishop,'' she said, ''and go home to Jamaica and build a school.'' Already, she said, they were making plans.</p>
        <p>ADAM P. ARIAS  A Lover and a Fighter</p>
        <p>After 15 lymphoma-related surgeries, Margit Arias never thought she would live to see as much of the world as her husband, Adam P. Arias, wanted to show her. So for their third wedding anniversary on Sept. 5, Mr. Arias, 37, surprised her with a globe encrusted with semiprecious stones.</p>
        <p>They had married 18 months after the stark diagnosis. He prodded and cajoled her through treatment. During chemotherapy week, he did everything around their Staten Island apartment. But he would deliberately put his cigar ashtray in the wrong place, to jolt Mrs. Arias, a neatness fanatic, out of her chemo stupor. When she felt stronger, Mr. Arias would take her to a movie, on trips out of town; he even nudged her onto a golf course.</p>
        <p>He was determined she would make it. A workaholic, he rose to a vice presidency at Euro Brokers with only a high school equivalency diploma. He was scary-smart -- at 7, he knew the names of all the presidents, their wives and their parties -- but not intimidatingly so, with a wicked wit and another life as a bar balladeer, covering songs from Tony Bennett and Meat Loaf.</p>
        <p>On Sept. 11, he was determined that others would make it, too. He lingered, prodding colleagues to leave. Last week, Mrs. Arias had her 16th operation. ''I didn't want to,'' she said. ''But Adam fought too hard to keep me alive.''</p>
        <p>ROBERT J. SHAY JR.  New Baby Has Dad's Eyes</p>
        <p>One of eight children, Robert J. Shay Jr. thrived in the company of his large, fun-loving family. And with his wife, Dawn, he was happily creating his own big brood. Just 27, he was already the devoted father of Robert, 5, and Ryan, 2. He did not get to meet his third son, Jonathan Robert, who was born on Monday. The newest Shay came with a head of thick black hair and his dad's eyes, ears and legs, said Eileen Shay, Robert's sister.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shay was a bond broker at Cantor Fitzgerald, which he joined in 1993 right after high school, starting in maintenance and working his way up. He was a Mets fan practically from birth, Ms. Shay said. ''As far back as we can find pictures of him, he's in his Mets gear.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Shay was always up and always watching out for others. He lived on Staten Island, just 15 minutes from his parents, whom he called many times each day. Around 8:40 a.m. on Sept. 11, he made a quick call to his wife to see how their son Robert's introduction to kindergarten was going.</p>
        <p>Recently, young Robert put some Halloween stickers on his bedroom window. Eileen said that he explained, ''I put up stars so my daddy can see where I am.''</p>
        <p>EDWARD LEHMAN  The Running Man</p>
        <p>Edward Lehman loved to run. He would run in the morning. He would run in the evening. He would run on the weekends, sometimes for three and a half hours.</p>
        <p>He belonged to a running club, and anytime there was a benefit run, he would be there. He especially liked to run for causes in and around Glen Cove, N.Y., where he lived. He ran for the local hospital. He ran for the local orphanage. He ran.</p>
        <p>The funny thing was, the running started out as the idea of his wife, Joanne, who had done sprints back in school. A couple of years ago, she announced to him that she'd like to start running again on a regular basis. Long jogs, she discovered, were nothing like short sprints. ''I stopped,'' she said. ''But he tried it and kept it up. I guess you could say, he took it and ran with it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lehman, 41, an assistant director in the risk management area at the Aon Corporation, really got into the fine points of the sport. He subscribed to running magazines. He bought books on running. He elaborated on his discoveries to his wife. ''The man would just not stop talking about it,'' she said. ''I'd tease him, 'Ed, enough.' He'd talk about the pace for hills and all that. He'd talk of the technical things. I'd say, 'Ed, layman terms, please.' ''</p>
        <p>SHANNON FAVA  She Dances in His Heart</p>
        <p>Frank and Shannon Fava would have celebrated their seventh wedding anniversary on Monday, so Mr. Fava was in a reflective mood this week. He remembered the first time he saw his wife. She was walking into a bagel shop in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. She was 18, and he was shy.</p>
        <p>''I had seen her once or twice before, and I just had to talk to her,'' Mr. Fava said. ''I'm a shy guy, but we started talking and just clicked.''</p>
        <p>What he thought might have been a fling turned into ''my first true love,'' he said. ''I watched her grow into a woman.''</p>
        <p>The woman Shannon Fava became loved to hug their 3-year-old son, Joseph Anthony, rent movies and laugh. Mrs. Fava, 30, worked as an assistant broker for Cantor Fitzgerald and lived in Bensonhurt. Mr. Fava said he can almost still see his wife dancing around the house to whatever is on MTV. He thinks that might be because she called after the plane hit her tower and said, ''Tell the baby I'll always be with him, and you.''</p>
        <p>KENNETH VAN AUKEN  An Arbor of Memories</p>
        <p>Kenneth Van Auken's job as a bond broker bought him the house with the yard in East Brunswick, N.J. But his passions for carpentry and gardening built the cedar-wood arbor in the yard where his widow, Lorie Van Auken, now goes to grieve.</p>
        <p>Mr. Van Auken, 47, who worked at Cantor Fitzgerald and left two children, finished the arbor a week before he died. Last week, the clematis plants that the Van Aukens picked out together for the arbor came in the mail. Mrs. Van Auken planted them with a friend at hand to keep her from crying too hard.</p>
        <p>Not far from where the pink flowers will crawl up the arbor, a big old maple stands dying, its leaves brown for months. But it is being allowed to stay for now. ''My husband loved this tree,'' Mrs. Van Auken said. ''We had decided to wait till spring to cut it down. Give it one more chance to go green again.''</p>
        <p>While Mrs. Van Auken is gardening to confront her loss, their 12-year-old daughter, Sarah, has written and recorded a song, ''Daddy's Little Girl,'' that has been played on pop radio stations.</p>
        <p>''Daddy, are you there?'' the song goes. ''Cause I've, I've looked everywhere.''</p>
        <p>''Maybe you'll appear, somehow whisper in my ear.''</p>
        <p>JOSEPH NAVAS  Making the Hours Count</p>
        <p>Given that the days Joseph Navas worked fluctuated -- his schedule was four days on, two days off -- and given that his overriding interest was doing things with his wife and three children, he had to improvise. That was O.K. He knew how to make hours count.</p>
        <p>If he was off on weekend days, it was easy. He might play ball with Joey, 9, or help coach his Little League team or his ice hockey team. He would take Jessica, 12, shopping, or watch her perform with her cheerleader squad. He might ride bikes with Justin, 3.</p>
        <p>When he was off on weekdays, school preoccupied the children, but he would make the most of the hours he had with them. He would drive them to school, or pick them up for lunch, or even bring them lunch.</p>
        <p>Mr. Navas, 44, was a Port Authority police officer, part of the emergency services unit, assigned to PATH. He worked out of Journal Square but was summoned to the World Trade Center after the attack. He was broadly trained. He had been to chemical identification school; he had learned how to deal with hazardous materials; he knew how to rappel; he was schooled in scuba diving.</p>
        <p>''He wanted his family to be safe,'' said his wife, Karen. ''He wanted everybody to be safe. That was why he was a police officer.''</p>
        <p>The Confirmed Dead</p>
        <p>Following are the names of the people most recently confirmed to have died in the World Trade Center disaster, according to the New York City medical examiner's office, which said the victims' families had been notified.</p>
        <p>HARRELL, Stephen G.  OLSEN, Jeffrey James  RUSSELL, Stephen P.  TALLON, Sean Patrick</p>
