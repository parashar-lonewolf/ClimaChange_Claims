        <p>A decade after Washington declared war on businesses that expose the public to hazardous wastes, environmental experts are questioning the unquestionable: Is it worth spending a staggering $300 billion to $700 billion to restore waste sites to pristine condition?</p>
        <p>While acknowledging that no level of exposure to dangerous chemicals is desirable, the experts argue that the risks should be put in perspective.</p>
        <p>Virtually all of the risk to human health, most analysts agree, could be eliminated for a tiny fraction of these sums. In a typical project, in Holden, Mo., $71,000 would be enough to isolate an abandoned factory containing residues of toxic chemicals, making it extremely unlikely that anyone would ever be harmed by the wastes. Another $3.6 million would clean up virtually all residues and bury remaining traces under a blanket of clay.  What Is Justified?</p>
        <p>But state and Federal laws requirea cleanup that would cost $13.6 million to $41.5 million. "The last couple turns of the screw cannot be justified on economic criteria," said Tom Grumbly, an environmentalist who is president of Clean Sites, a nonprofit organization in Virginia that advises communities on hazardous waste cleanups.</p>
        <p>To be sure, the problem of weighing cleanup benefits against the costs is complicated by a lack of information about how dangerous individual chemicals are, and in what concentrations.  Nonetheless, experts insist that what began as a crusade against polluters has become a diversion, siphoning money and technical expertise from more pressing environmental concerns.  Tougher Criteria Suggested</p>
        <p>More stringent scientific criteria should be used to identify waste sites needing immediate attention, they say. And once identified, the cleanup should be carefully aimed at saving lives rather than restoring land to preindustrial condition.</p>
        <p>Analysts acknowledge that redirecting Government policy will be nearly impossible without a radical change in the way Americans think about the risks from hazardous waste. Some would try to temper the zeal for large-scale cleanups by asking the communities that benefit to share in the costs. "Everybody wants a Cadillac as long as someone else is paying," said Robert Hahn, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a research organization in Washington. Little Confidence in Washington</p>
        <p>But there is little confidence in Washington that cost-sharing would make a big difference in public attitudes. And no enthusiasm can be detected for asking voters to pay to protect themselves against hazards they did not create.</p>
        <p>A first priority, argues Frank Blake, a former general counsel to the Environmental Protection Agency who now works for the General Electric Company, is more credible information that lifts the "fog of fear" from public perceptions. Specifically, he says, people need ways to compare the risks of exposure with the dozens of other risks that are accepted as part of daily life.</p>
        <p>The best-known Federal waste initiative is Superfund, which has spent $11 billion in a decade on emergency measures at 400 abandoned sites and full-scale cleanups at 60 others. But the cleanup mandated by the Superfund legislation has barely begun.</p>
        <p>Some 1,200 other sites are already on the Environmental Protection Agency's national priority list, and the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment expects thousands to be added. What is more, a slew of Federal laws require the eventual cleanup of tens of thousands of other sites polluted by government and business. Mr. Grumbly of Clean Sites says the bill for waste containment could reach $20 billion a year by the end of the decade.  What the Country Can Afford</p>
        <p>The country could afford such sums, everyone agrees, if the problem demanded it. Businesses and taxpayers have managed to cope with other anti-pollution regulations that now cost $115 billion annually, by the E.P.A.'s reckoning. But little hard evidence exists to support a crash effort.</p>
        <p>People living or working near identified toxic waste sites naturally worry that the chemicals will find their way into air, food and water. But many analysts believe the immediate dangers have been exaggerated.</p>
        <p>"When you look for deaths from hazardous wastes, you just don't find them," said Bill Ralston, an analyst at SRI International, a consulting company in California.</p>
        <p>The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that roughly 1,000 cancer cases annually can be linked to public exposure to hazardous waste.  That hardly makes abadoned waste sites a non-problem in anyone's book. But the environmental agency does rank hazardous waste far behind cancer risks like exposure to chemicals in the workplace and depletion of the atmosheric ozone layer. Moreover, many of these greater risks could be reduced at a tiny fraction of the cost of the hazardous waste fix mandated by law. The Example of Radon Gas</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. estimates, for example, that 5,000 to 20,000 lung cancer deaths are caused each year by indoor exposure to radon gas leaking from underground rock formations. Most of these deaths could be prevented by performing inexpensive tests on buildings in radon-prone areas and ventilating basements where concentrations of the radioactive gas are high.</p>
        <p>What explains this apparent distortion in environmental priorities? Political economists have long noted that the focused convictions of the few almost always dominate the weakly held views of the many. And Christopher Daggett, the former head of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, argues that nothing focuses convictions like a nearby waste site. "Try telling people that the leaking drums across the street aren't a hazard," he said.  Legal and Moral Responsibility</p>
        <p>There are the questions of legal and moral responsibility. Some environmental hazards, like auto emissions, are everyone's fault -- and therefore no one's. Some, like cigarette smoking, are no one's fault but one's own. But Mr. Gough notes that the public blames "greedy and thoughtless" corporations for the waste peril and is thus little inclined to weigh the benefits of cleanups against the costs.</p>
        <p>It is not surprising, then, that communities with waste sites in their midst want them restored to how they were before industrial use. Nor is it surprising that the elected officials and administrators who write the rules for cleanups take their cues from an angry and anxious public.</p>
        <p>Consider the 11-acre Rose Chemicals Company site in Holden, Mo. Until 1986 the site was used to store and process PCB's, toxic liquid chemicals prized by makers of electrical transmission equipment for their insulating properties and their stability at high temperatures. The barrels of PCB's were removed long ago, but residues remain in the buildings, the soil and the bed of a small stream.  A Range of Options</p>
        <p>An E.P.A. analysis says that for $71,000, the site could be permanently isolated from the community. The town's drinking water would be safe because there is no groundwater to tap near the site. But under Superfund regulations, this cheap fix would be unacceptable because there is one chance in 10,000 that someone would develop cancer from eating the cattle that grazed near the property's perimeter -- and roughly the same risk that a determined trespasser could get cancer from repeated contact with building surfaces.</p>
        <p>Other possible fixes range from cleaning the stream bed and capping the site with 10 inches of clay ($3.7 million) to removing 14,000 tons of contaminated soil and building materials and incinerating it elsewhere ($41.5 million). The E.P.A.'s preferred $13.6 million option: remove all of the suspect soil and materials, then incinerate the most contaminated debris and bury the rest in a specially designed landfill. A Cheaper Alternative</p>
        <p>Mr. Grumbly of Clean Sites notes that the E.P.A.'s compromise would allow virtually any future use of the site. And he points out that it would cost just a third as much as the maximum effort.</p>
        <p>But others may wonder whether the more flexible use of the land is worth the extra $900,000 an acre beyond the cost of scrubbing the stream and capping the property. And still others may ask whether a bare-bones fix -- one that reduces neighborhood cancer risks to, say, one-thousandth the chance of getting cancer from a lifetime of normal exposure to the sun -- would not be adequate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hahn of the American Enterprise Institute and others inclined toward less ambitious goals suggest using financial incentives to discipline the decision-making process. If those at risk from hazardous waste sites wanted more than a basic cleanup, they could be asked to share in the cost.</p>
        <p>Dan Dudek, an economist at the Environmental Defense Fund, a mainstream environmental group, offers a variation based on the carrot rather than the stick. Instead of taxing communities to cover the extra cleanup effort, he would give them part of the savings associated with a less-than- total repair. The town of Holden, for example, might be offered 20 percent of the $9.9 million difference as an incentive to save lives in other ways -- say, by purchasing more efficient firefighting equipment, or by testing every home for radon and lead contamination.</p>
        <p>That idea appeals to Francis Brillhart, the mayor of Holden, who said he fears that the "E.P.A. is going a bit overboard," slowing the cleanup by choosing a method that requires incineration. If Holden could keep some of the savings generated by a faster cleanup, he says, so much the better.</p>
        <p>But few experts think many communities would be likely to take the financial bait. The approach presumes that people would compromise on safety in return for lower taxes or improved public services. Everyone trades safety for money or convenience or simply pleasure in daily life -- new tires are safer than worn ones, turkey breast is safer to eat than a cheeseburger. But people rarely acknowledge they are making choices, even to themselves.  Need to Educate the Public</p>
        <p>That is why most analysts worried about the open-ended commitment to scrubbing the country pin their hopes on educating the public about relative risks. "We need more and better information about health risks," said Katherine Probst, an analyst at Resources for the Future, a nonprofit environmental research group.</p>
        <p>The way in which the information is presented may also matter: knowing hazardous waste can kill is less useful than knowing it kills one-twentieth as many Americans as radon.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grumbly of Clean Sites argues that the credibility of government turns on the transparency of its decision-making. One key to a rational public debate, he insists, is to "let the public in on the game."</p>
        <p>But Mr. Grumbly is an optimist. "People understand," he says, "when they are wasting other people's money."</p>
