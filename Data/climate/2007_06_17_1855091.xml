        <p>MATTHEW MATHOSIAN couldn't afford to buy a house on Long Island, even if he could find one to suit his modern aesthetic and concern for the environment. But Mr. Mathosian, 27, an architecture student, and more than 75 of his classmates at New York Institute of Technology in Old Westbury are building a house that they hope will one day attract like-minded home buyers in their 20s and 30s.</p>
        <p>The house will be constructed on the school's campus in Old Westbury, then disassembled in the fall and transported by truck to the National Mall in Washington.

        <p>MATTHEW MATHOSIAN couldn't afford to buy a house on Long Island, even if he could find one to suit his modern aesthetic and concern for the environment. But Mr. Mathosian, 27, an architecture student, and more than 75 of his classmates at New York Institute of Technology in Old Westbury are building a house that they hope will one day attract like-minded home buyers in their 20s and 30s.</p>
        <p>The house will be constructed on the school's campus in Old Westbury, then disassembled in the fall and transported by truck to the National Mall in Washington. There, it will be one of 20 entries in the 2007 Solar Decathlon, a contest started in 2002 by the United States Department of Energy and now held every two years.</p>
        <p>The steel supports of ''Open House,'' as the students are calling their design, arrived earlier this month in a parking lot on the school campus. On a recent Monday afternoon, four students in tool belts were discussing the design as they measured and hammered away, some tripping over wood planks.</p>
        <p>The goal of the contest is to build a house that runs completely on energy from the sun, that can also power an electric vehicle and that is marketable and financially viable.</p>
        <p>The contest requires that the house be 800 square feet in size, and the Energy Department provides the electric car and $100,000 to each team to help defray costs.</p>
        <p>''We're looking for innovation and new products,'' said Richard King, the director of the Solar Decathlon in Washington, ''and we want to transfer all of this into mainstream America.'' The homes are judged in 10 categories, including architectural design and engineering. Once the house has been rebuilt in Washington, six people will live in it from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. for nine days, Mr. King said. They will wash clothes, cook meals, heat and cool the house, watch television, take hot showers and drive around the city in the electric car using power generated by the house.</p>
        <p>The students' project, chosen from among 30 proposals from the United States and other countries, including Germany, Spain and Canada, is the only one from the New York metropolitan area.</p>
        <p>The house has two parts: a long rectangular core, which is to house the kitchen, bath and the plumbing, mechanical systems and electrical hookups, and a 480-square-foot undivided open space, much like a loft, whose layout can be customized.</p>
        <p>There are solar panels built into the roof, and below the roof on the south-facing side of the house is a pergolalike ledge that is covered with a thin film that helps improve the solar panels' output on cloudy days. The solar panels power the house during the day and also charge an array of batteries that take over at night when the sun goes down. (Solar panels, or photovoltaic cells, do not store power and can create electricity only when there is sunlight.)</p>
        <p>The students have gone all out to ''prove to the public that solar energy is here now,'' Mr. Mathosian said. They estimate the cost for the house at $225,000, not including the land. They have used local companies and materials, he added, explaining that some supplies had been donated by company sponsors.</p>
        <p>Mr. King of the Department of Energy said some school groups had formed companies and sold the homes they designed. There will be a free tour of the homes on the National Mall from Oct. 12 to 20, he said.</p>
        <p>After the contest, blueprints and lists of products used in each home will be available on the contest Web site: solardecathlon.org.</p>
        <p>The New York students' home design is intended for a South Shore oceanfront community, like Long Beach or Fire Island -- largely for the intense sunlight there that would make for good solar power.</p>
        <p>But the design also incorporates other green building techniques that harness the cooling and heating power of the wind and earth.</p>
        <p>The south wall of the house, for example, will have floor-to-ceiling windows that open accordion style. Ideally, the wind would swoosh in and push the hot air in the house up and out of a set of smaller windows running along the top of the north side.</p>
        <p>A pool of water above the house's core would simulate geothermal cooling and heating, which would be employed if the construction were permanent. Pipes running through the temperature-moderated water in the pool would also run through the house, heating or cooling it according to the season. In a permanent location, the pipes would travel deep underground to provide the same effect.</p>
        <p>One of the advisers to the project, Frank Mruk, the associate dean for the School of Architecture and Design at New York Institute of Technology, said the students' project was part of a new ''green'' or sustainable-energy aesthetic that has crossed many disciplines.</p>
        <p>Comparing it with past movements, like Beaux-Arts at the turn of the last century and modernism during the Industrial Revolution, Mr. Mruk described the green movement as a ''paradigm shift'' in design, d√©cor and lifestyle.</p>
        <p>Students involved in the project are not all architects. Interior design students will lay out the inside of the house when it is built and design the furniture; communications students are in charge of promotion; marketing students are developing a sales plan; and engineering students are designing the power structure.</p>
        <p>The house is designed to meet federal and local New York State building codes, opting for the more stringent requirements where they differ, according to Matthew Vecchione, the project leader for the team.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vecchione, a fifth-year architecture student, also worked on the school's entry in the 2005 Solar Decathlon. That house used solar panels with fuel cells, instead of batteries. The fuel cell, which converts hydrogen to electricity without combustion (no greenhouse gases), was an innovative energy storage attempt, but proved far less efficient than batteries.</p>
        <p>The 2005 house now sits next to the soccer field at the United States Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point. Gregory Sachs, an engineering instructor there, who designed the electrical system for the house, lives in it most of the time.</p>
        <p>But this year's entry, the Open House, seems more conscious of its marketability. A visitor to Open House won't know that it's different from a conventional house, said Paola Kocerha, the project's marketing team leader, but ''this one is better since all the power is generated by the sun.''</p>
        <p>Students are also developing designs for a larger house, to accommodate a family of four, she said.</p>
