        <p>REMEMBER Smokey Bear? He personified the nation's campaign against forest fires set accidentally by humans, but said nothing about overzealous forest management policies that may have made forest conflagrations worse when they inevitably did occur.</p>
        <p>Or how about McGruff, the trench-coated anticrime dog? He's been on the beat for 25 years and has yet to throw a criminal in jail. Quite the opposite; in his heyday during the 1980's, crime was terrible, and while the crime rate has dropped since then, I haven't heard any criminologists suggesting the dog deserves the credit.</p>
        <p>The Bush administration's recent promotion of Energy Hog, the painfully appropriate personification of its woeful new energy saving campaign, thus fits into a rich historical tradition of pathetic government mascots who are asked to solve problems we either can't or won't.</p>
        <p>As much scapegoats as solutions, these poor creatures must try and carry away our sins as few private sector mascots have ever had to do. You can almost hear the Michelin man weep in sympathy.</p>
        <p>Energy Hog bears these burdens, too, but without the advantage of much good will. He's not as clever as the Aflac duck or as charmingly roly-poly as the Pillsbury Doughboy. No, Energy Hog just embodies everything that is worst in the national character; he looks like a caricature of the Ugly American from some left-wing European newspaper.</p>
        <p>''Smokey and McGruff were good guys, acting to protect us,'' observes Constantine von Hoffman, a senior writer at CMO, a magazine for marketing executives. ''The Energy Hog is what you don't want to be, and so therefore not loveable.'' He's more like the dastardly Mr. Coffee Nerves, who was said to wreak havoc on caffeine addicts in the 1950's.</p>
        <p>Then again, what else but pork can we expect from Washington? Ever since the gasoline lines and cardigan sweaters of the 1970's, it's been obvious America has an energy crisis, even if low oil prices covered it up for a while.</p>
        <p>Despite the previous scares in which supplies suddenly went short, the United States still uses far more energy per dollar of output than other advanced industrial (or post-industrial) nations. Our addiction to cheap energy also helps support some of the world's worst regimes, and it appears to contribute mightily to global warming. It may even support terrorism.</p>
        <p>With so much at stake, a sensible leadership (blessed, in all fairness, with a sensible electorate) might have imposed a hefty fossil fuel tax that might simultaneously close the federal deficit, finance a crash program of research to find alternatives to oil and promote conservation. At the least, we could roll back the tax, zoning and other government policies that promote energy profligacy.</p>
        <p>Instead, we get a bloated pig who is the visual equivalent of ''Whip Inflation Now,'' that uniquely ineffective slogan invented by the administration of President Gerald Ford when it had no idea what else to do about runaway inflation in the 1970's.</p>
        <p>Indeed, I know of no clearer signal of futility than when government resorts to mottos and mascots. How many sport utility vehicle owners can remember Woodsy the Owl (''Give a hoot! Don't pollute!'')? Or Chief Iron Eyes Cody, whose reaction to a scarred landscape was a single wrenching tear (and who, after 30 years of sprawl, must be crying himself a river)?</p>
        <p>Of course, companies occasionally substitute mascots for solutions as well. Microsoft is a notable example. In the 1990's, it wheeled out Bob, a character who was supposed to put a human face on its maddeningly complex software. Later we got Clippit, Microsoft's irritatingly twee office assistant, who mainly seemed to drive users to distraction.</p>
        <p>Despite the clear threat our energy habit poses to the economy, the best we can hope for from this new mascot is a kind of aversion therapy; by helping each of us recognize our inner Energy Hog, he may shame a few into conservation.</p>
        <p>At the very least, Energy Hog decals deserve a place of honor on every S.U.V. Perhaps Energy Hog tattoos could be made tax-deductible.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, we do not have to rely on Energy Hog to help us save energy; sustained high prices will do the job all by themselves. In that sense, hurricanes and oil cartels are as helpful as restrictions on drilling, refineries and nuclear power plants.</p>
        <p>It's just too bad the mascot we already had -- good old Uncle Sam, once so ready to roll up his sleeves and get his hands dirty -- can't do more to help.</p>
