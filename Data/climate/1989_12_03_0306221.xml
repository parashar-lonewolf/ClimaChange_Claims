        <p>LEAD: SOMETIMES losing an enemy can be more unsettling than losing a friend. The world order that since the end of World War II has shaped American politics, its view of the world and itself has suddenly come crashing down.</p>
        <p>SOMETIMES losing an enemy can be more unsettling than losing a friend. The world order that since the end of World War II has shaped American politics, its view of the world and itself has suddenly come crashing down.</p>
        <p>Through two generations, nearly every politician of national standing has been defined in large measure by where he stood on, and how he stood up to, the Red Menace. Just last year George Bush ran campaign commercials saying he could look Mikhail S. Gorbachev in the eye and not blink. Gov. Michael S. Dukakis allowed himself to be shown riding in a tank built to fight a land war in Europe.</p>
        <p>But the end of the cold war should bring the end of cold war politics. A central idea has been plucked from the heart of American political culture, and party leaders and academic experts are just beginning to grapple with the import of this.</p>
        <p>''Every night for 40 years we walked into the bedroom, opened the closet and looked under the bed to see if we could find a Communist,'' said Representative Dante B. Fascell, the Florida Democrat. ''And one day we walked in, and he was in our bed, smiling. It's very confusing.''</p>
        <p>Democrats calculate that they stand to gain as attention shifts away from fears of war to concern with the domestic issues that have been their bread and butter. For their part, Republicans concede they have lost an issue that helped them more than Democrats. But they hope benefits will flow to the party whose hard line, in their view, brought Communism to its knees.</p>
        <p>Ronald H. Brown, the Democratic National Chairman, declared that the changes in Europe will ''help the Democratic Party immensely.''</p>
        <p>The political dialogue will be thrown open to issues the Democrats feel stronger on, like education and the environment, said Mr. Brown, and ''it really does take a major arrow away from the Republicans.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps, say Republican leaders. ''If our candidates are foolish enought to campaign as if the cold war were still on they'll get hurt,'' said Lee Atwater, the Republican National Chairman. But Mr. Atwater disputes suggestions that the Republicans will suffer at the polls now. President Reagan's hard line with the Soviet Government - indeed, with Marxist governments everywhere -helped produce the decline of Communism, he said, and George Bush will benefit by being at the creation of this new world.</p>
        <p>Shortly before Mr. Bush left for his meeting in Malta with Mr. Gorbachev, some in Washington thought back to how Winston Churchill was ousted by the British voters almost immediately after the end of World War II. But Mr. Atwater sees no parallels. He said that while Americans are restless about the quality of life, they are not battered and hungry the way the British were. ''As long as the economy stays stable I am firmly convinced that the party in power benefits,'' Mr. Atwater said.</p>
        <p>Some leaders in both parties concede they do not know what this will all mean. For one thing, the course of events in Europe is still far from clear. A retrenchment, either in Eastern Europe or in the Soviet Union itself, could revive cold war feelings here.</p>
        <p>James McGregor Burns, the historian, suggests that the cold war cannot have a clearly defined ending. ''The cold war is not over because there will remain a huge reservoir of thinking from the cold war period still in the minds and attitudes of the American people,'' he said. ''That reservoir of feeling will be played on by politicians.''</p>
        <p>Surveys support Mr. Burns. In a New York Times/CBS New Poll conducted last week, more than half of all adults who were questioned said they thought the cold war was not over yet. And the poll found general support for what Mr. Bush calls his ''prudent'' approach (and what Democrats call timid). A total of 67 percent of those interviewed either supported current levels of military spending or small reductions, such as Mr. Bush is currently considering. Just 21 percent said Pentagon spending should be subject to deeper cuts than have been proposed.</p>
        <p>It may well be that the ultimate effect on American politics will not be to help one party over the other, but to fragment both. The stress on the Republicans is already clear. ''The collapse of Communism also means the collapse of a lot of the glue that has connected the various strands of the conservative movement,'' said William Bodie of the Smith Richardson Foundation, which supports many conservative groups.</p>
        <p>Strains on both parties may result to the extent that economic concerns replace military and ideological ones. Fred Siegel, a historian at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, N.J., noted that the tariff battles of the 19th century tended to cause divisions within the parties as local economic interests overrode national ones. The same thing might happen again as each region weighs its place in the world market.</p>
        <p>Anti-Communism has been central to the Republican Party, but it has also shaped politics among the Democrats. Not long ago, talk of the Jackson wing of the party referred not to the Rev. Jesse Jackson, but to Henry M. Jackson, the late Senator from Washington state whose support for military preparedness against the Soviets helped cement the bipartisan consensus of the cold war.</p>
        <p>Some Democrats have tried to follow in Senator Jackson's footsteps in recent years, seeking to build reputations as strong supporters of the Pentagon. But already the scramble for new issues is under way. Senator Albert Gore of Tennessee, who sought the Democratic Presidential nomination last year as a hawk in a field of doves, has spent much of this year talking about environmental problems raised by the greenhouse effect.</p>
        <p>Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York gave speeches last week on American competitiveness. Mr. Cuomo even used words reminiscent of the cold war talk of missile gaps. ''The Japanese and the Germans are moving ahead of us economically,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''It's a war for markets. It's a war for productivity and quality products. And you're losing now.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps the American psyche has been so conditioned that it must regard the world in terms of wars and foes. Perhaps more likely, it will simply take some time to get used to the new world.</p>
