        <p>Al Gore, at least, had some good news to offer. It was one of the President's darkest days. Bill Clinton was at his mother's house in Arkansas preparing for her funeral, yet there was little time to mourn; he was leaving the next day for Europe. If that were not enough, word had come that the President's nomination of Bobby Ray Inman as Secretary of Defense would soon implode. Clinton was at his gloomiest during a conference call with his closest aides at the White House when the Vice President spoke up with words to raise the Presidential spirits. After weeks of secret communications with President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine, Gore and other officials had virtually completed a historic agreement under which Ukraine would surrender its nuclear warheads. "I think we've got the deal," Gore told the red-eyed President on that January afternoon. Two days later, in a Sunday television interview, the Vice President denied reports of an impending accord, leaving the grand announcement for Clinton to make the next day in Brussels.</p>
        <p>Gore's voice is often there at the right moment. In what has long been largely an ornamental office, he has become the President's most influential adviser, excepting, of course, Hillary Rodham Clinton. He challenged Ross Perot to debate, against the advice of others in the White House, and won. He has moved in to share the spotlight on foreign affairs with the Secretary of State. He has become a recognized authority on a range of 21st-century issues like electronic information and global warming. He has taken on pious projects of doubtful potential like remodeling the Federal Government and has sought to give them substance. And he doesn't do funerals.</p>
        <p>The Vice President does much of his work unseen, perpetually dashing 18 steps down the blue-carpeted hallway from what he calls the Square Office to the back door of the Oval Office. Once there, he helps the President on minute details as well as major issues -- sitting down at a computer himself, for instance, and typing in last-minute retouches to a Presidential address or urging Clinton to tape a weekly radio program so the First Family can have an uninterrupted holiday at Camp David.</p>
        <p>In just one year, Albert A. Gore Jr. has given the office of Vice President its most consequential place in history. He is now regarded as a natural in the job, as the ideal No. 2. Accordingly, the question already arises: Granting the inevitable uncertainties of the future, does Gore have what it takes to make the next big leap, to be elected President? "That," says David R. Gergen, a counselor to Clinton and an ally of Gore, "is one of the great questions of American politics."</p>
        <p>Why should this be a question? Because Gore knows he has to overcome certain impressions -- that, despite his 17 years in public office, he is not an electric politician. That he is somewhat of a "Robo Veep" who often does not connect with ordinary people. That, in a sense, he may be too good to be President. Pauline Gore recalls him as a reliable son who was "determined to please," and he plays that role now for the Clintons. Gore does what he is asked and does it well. But is he less an inspirational leader and more a good and faithful follower?</p>
        <p>Gore seems to be groping with the question himself and acts a bit like a student cramming for his next assignment. From the shelf, he pulls one of his favorite books, a self-help guide for young executives: "On Becoming a Leader." Here is a 45-year-old man who has made it to the top tier of world politics and he is still trying to learn leadership from a paperback, who employs a New Age-style facilitator to better relate to his staff, who is trying to learn to loosen up and show his sense of humor while still acting like a statesman.</p>
        <p>Yet he dare not try too hard. He can't outshine his boss -- or his boss's wife. Gore may be the highest-profile Vice President ever, but Hillary Rodham Clinton is the highest-profile First Lady. Clinton acknowledges that his wife's shadow can hide his Vice President. "Our relationships are not comparable, obviously," he says in an interview. "But what you need to know is that I believe, based on everything I've been able to read or learn from others, he has a larger role substantively and more influence than any Vice President. Ever."</p>
        <p>The President, though diplomatic, is hardly definitive when asked whether Gore would succeed him. After a long pause, he says, "I hope we do a good enough job so that's what he wants and that's what the American people want." Reinventing the Office</p>
        <p>For a President who swerves from crisis to crisis, Gore is a steadying hand. He knows his issues and tenaciously battles to expand his turf. His judgment, disciplined approach and willingness to take on knotty assignments help explain his acquired power.</p>
        <p>Not that he doesn't make mistakes. Initially, it was Gore who pushed Inman for Secretary of Defense. But weeks later it was also Gore who twisted William Perry's arm to take the job. A private meeting with him at the Vice President's residence sped the process and saved the President embarrassment of further delay.</p>
        <p>The critical establishing moment was his taming of the little Texas dragon who had been breathing fire at the White House for months and seems now to be doing so no more. Witness the scene in Gore's Denver hotel suite the day after his November debate with Ross Perot over the North American Free Trade Agreement.</p>
        <p>Tie and shoes off, head propped on two pillows, giddy from only three hours sleep, the Vice President is sprawled on a sofa, reveling in the notices of his triumph. "You see the headline?" says the man who seldom displays emotion. "Slam Dunk." He takes congratulatory calls. "It worked, didn't it?" he spouts to his old friend Tom Downey, a former Representative from Long Island.</p>
        <p>The man on the sofa exults, but does not rest. He is soon making call after call to recalcitrant members of Congress, seeking to turn his success in the nationally televised debate to a win for Nafta. He pleads with a House Democrat: "Can you keep us from getting killed on it?" While Gore administers the pressure, an aide, Dennis Alpert, mockingly fans this would-be sultan with a hotel bathroom towel, as if attending Valentino. One of his lobbyist lieutenants on Capitol Hill, Michael Feldman, sits at Gore's stocking feet, egging him on with a quiet yet steady chant: "He's on fire! He's hot! He's hot!"</p>
        <p>In his own buttoned-down way, Al Gore is hot.</p>
        <p>He maintained the momentum with his trip to Russia the next month. Trailed by an entourage that included Clinton's top foreign policy advisers, Gore met at the Kremlin with President Boris N. Yeltsin. He made his biggest splash when he delivered the Administration's attack on Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the ultranationalist whose faction won the second-largest bloc in the parliamentary elections. Gore had awkward moments. He was caught off guard by Zhirinovsky's strong showing and had to revise his public comments. The scene was nevertheless reminiscent of Vice President Nixon's trip to Moscow in 1959, when he drew worldwide attention in his "kitchen debate" with Nikita Khrushchev. Gore, in fact, conferred with Nixon before the trip.</p>
        <p>What gives Gore his influence is his access. He and Clinton typically start the day together with the President's national security briefing in the Oval Office, and he often spends more than half his day with the President. On the morning of the Middle East peace signing, Gore scribbled lines into the President's text, giving it more historical breadth. Says Clinton: "He immediately saw what ought to be done to it and made three or four suggestions that made it very effective."</p>
        <p>That the 45th Vice President has this power is no accident. Gore recognized from the start that he was taking a risk in accepting a job so often ridiculed as standby equipment. He sought the advice of Walter F. Mondale, who expanded its responsibilities under President Carter. Then, during three sessions of friendly negotiations at the Governor's Mansion in Little Rock, Ark., before they took office, Gore sought assurances from Clinton that, among other things, he and the President meet weekly for lunch, that he get an office close to the Oval Office, that he be welcome at most meetings there and that the Vice President's chief of staff be made an assistant to the President as a way to integrate the two staffs. Clinton agreed to all of his requests.</p>
        <p>Clinton and Gore are together so much that the Vice President's advisers think he sometimes appears too eager -- too, well, clingy. But Gore would almost rather look silly than give up any access. That is no doubt why he resisted recommendations by his aides to take his own trips in the early days of the Administration. The aides prevailed, however, on Gore not to tag along with Clinton at the President's first summit with Yeltsin, in Vancouver, telling him that while no one would stop him, he would not have much of a role there.</p>
        <p>Gore carefully adheres to two old-style White House rules: that Vice Presidents must be loyal and that they must be self-effacing. The loyalty requirement never stopped some like Lyndon B. Johnson from saying nice things about the President in public but trashing him in private. Gore's fidelity, public and private, appears complete. Even to his confidants, he will not say anything remotely critical of Clinton. As for self-effacing, Roy Neel, Gore's former chief of staff, has a photo taken in the Oval Office showing Neel whispering in Gore's ear. At the bottom, Gore scribbled: "To Roy -- O.K., I've got it: I stand behind him motionless and keep my mouth shut -- Al."</p>
        <p>One of Gore's proudest accomplishments has been his bringing the Big Three automobile companies together in an attempt to build an environmentally clean car. But, again, the public announcement about it, like that on Ukraine's agreement to surrender nuclear weapons, came from the President. The Vice President stood a few steps back. Pressing for Principle</p>
        <p>Gore dares to disagree. But he keeps the President's trust because he chooses his moments well, and always in private.</p>
        <p>One evening last summer, the President summoned close advisers to his residence to find a remedy for one of the most contentious issues of his first year: his pledge to overturn the ban on homosexuals in the military. Savaged by opposition from the military and Congress, Clinton was urged by one adviser after another to compromise. Except for Gore. Sitting to the right of the President, he argued that Clinton should stick to his principles and press for a full lifting of the ban, knowing that Congress would be nearly certain to reverse him.</p>
        <p>"Gore took a very lonely position," Gergen recalls. "He was the one who said he wanted the purest position. He thought a complete lifting of the ban was the right way to go. He said it would show guts." But by the end of the evening, it was clear that Clinton was moving toward the compromise. To Gergen's surprise, Gore did not bring up the matter the next day at his weekly lunch with the President: "Most people would say: 'Now's my chance. I've got my hour alone and I'll turn him around.' But he came out of that lunch and he told me he didn't raise the issue. He didn't think it was the right thing to do." Neither Clinton nor Gore will discuss it now. "That was a very difficult decision that we all had, and everybody offered their views," Clinton says. Asked about Gore's advice, the President snaps: "I just don't think I should discuss our conversations. If other people are doing it, they shouldn't be."</p>
        <p>The episode demonstrates Gore's place in White House decision making. He is not shy about speaking out in private. But he will push only so far. "He doesn't pull rank; he makes an argument," says George Stephanopoulos, a senior Clinton adviser who advocated compromise. Gore puts it this way: "I'm not out to win arguments for the sake of winning arguments. But if some principle is at stake which I think is crucial, then I will push it harder."</p>
        <p>Push? More like a genteel shove, with Southern civility. But he is strong-willed and will argue strenuously, particularly in defending what he regards as his turf. Hours before Clinton was to deliver a major Earth Day speech on the environment, Gore was told that Clinton was rethinking his promise to impose stricter carbon monoxide emission standards on automobiles. Furious that others in the Administration were trying to undermine him, he marched into the Oval Office. And he prevailed. "He has a very profound moral sense," Clinton says. "Al is always on the side of encouraging me to do what I think is right, which I appreciate.</p>
        <p>Gore has had other defeats. In keeping with an inclination that appears greater that Clinton's to use force, he pushed for a tougher policy on Haiti and for more military action in Bosnia, a position Clinton accepted and then abandoned when it faced opposition in Congress. But when Gore loses, his approach is to move to the next issue, saying there is no time to hold grudges. "A President of the United States," he says, "has about six to eight gut-wrenching decisions every day." First Lady, Second Man</p>
        <p>By putting Hillary Clinton in charge of devising a national health care proposal, the President handed her a big assignment on an issue in which Gore had taken a strong interest in the Senate. Gore himself had toyed with the idea of taking on health care, but he told his aides during the transition that the issue would be too consuming. Besides, Mrs. Clinton wanted it.</p>
        <p>Except for many social occasions when they clearly seem to get along fine, Gore and Mrs. Clinton take pains to stay out of each other's way.</p>
        <p>The First Lady was noticeably quiet, participants say, when she sat in on a meeting with her husband and Gore last fall over how the President's time should be divided between health care and the trade agreement.</p>
        <p>"Since the first bus trip, there was just some sense that, well, there was going to be tension between Hillary and Al," Neel says. "And it just has never happened."</p>
        <p>Gore praises her with many of the same words that people use to praise him. "She is an extremely intelligent, capable, warm person who gives the President excellent advice on a wide range of matters," he says.</p>
        <p>Would Hillary Clinton make a good President? Gore sputters out a polite but hardly encouraging response: "I think she's capable of doing an effective job at anything she undertakes."</p>
        <p>Gore knows he must be deferential to this First Lady but is he concerned that she may be overshadowing him?</p>
        <p>"No," he replies. Then he pauses.</p>
        <p>"I mean -- no." Reinventing Government, or Piety?</p>
        <p>After yielding the health reform domain, Gore sought out supervision of another high-profile project, welfare reform. He had a reputation on Capitol Hill of avoiding the great roiling issues of the day that test leaders, like race relations, so his aides thought it was important for him to embrace something that directly involved people. But with health care getting off the ground and a budget battle brewing, Clinton told him last spring that it was too early to move on welfare and suggested that Gore take up an initiative for "reinventing Government," proposing ways to pare the Federal bureaucracy and make it more efficient.</p>
        <p>Gore was warned that the assignment sounded like make work that others had tried and failed. "I said, 'You won't get anywhere with that sort of thing; it's a loser,' " recalls Tim Wirth, an under secretary at the State Department. "You use up a huge amount of credit trying to move the furniture around."</p>
        <p>But Gore, ignoring the concerns, did his best to puff up his assignment. "He didn't want to just launch reinventing Government," says Stanley Greenberg, the President's pollster. "He wanted a block of the President's time over a 10-day period to make reinventing Government a priority. Which he got." He also published a glossy reinventing Government report with his name -- and not the President's -- on the cover.</p>
        <p>Then Gore had to fight his biggest internal battle to turn the initiative into a real splash. At more than one tense meeting with the President, Gore argued strenuously, against George Stephanopoulos, who opposed putting out specific figures on how much waste the proposal would cut. Gore prevailed, although some White House officials said the Vice President's determination to cite figures opened the Administration to attack.</p>
        <p>So far, the follow-through has not lived up to the hype. The plan was supposed to save $108 billion over six years. But the Congressional Budget Office studied one portion of the plan designed to save $6 billion and calculated that it would save only $305 million. The budget office believes the rest of the plan may be overly optimistic as well, though probably not to the same degree.</p>
        <p>"Al will sometimes lead with his enthusiasm," Downey says. "Was it oversold a little bit? Yes it was. It's not going to cut $108 billion. And emphasizing how much it's going to cut is not all that smart. The Republicans then hold you to it." Besides, They're Friends</p>
        <p>Gore has not remade the Vice Presidency forever; another President could relegate a Gore successor to oblivion. The difference this time is a factor not common among most past Presidents and Vice Presidents: Gore and Clinton are close friends and so are their families.</p>
        <p>One Monday evening in January, Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton slipped out and, defying weather reports of a major snowstorm, drove to the Naval Observatory, the Vice President's residence, for dinner. Over chicken with cilantro, the two couples, their children and Gore's mother never left the dining-room table. They chatted and laughed for three hours, much like yuppie neighbors in the suburbs.</p>
        <p>"I don't think we talked about any business at all," Gore says. "I don't think we talked about any issues or problems. We talked about movies, books, interesting people that we met recently, interesting conversations that we've had, stuff like that."</p>
        <p>Despite their closeness, Gore says he always addresses Clinton as "Mr. President" in public. But when they are alone, he finds ways around the formal title without succumbing to a presumptuous "Bill." Clinton often calls him "Al" in private. When they're offstage, Gore is the one to defuse Clinton's temper tantrums with deadpan humor. Once, with the President in a rage over Democrats in Congress who never seemed to have anything nice to say about the Administration, Gore said, sternly, "I'll speak with them." The President laughed.</p>
        <p>Gore knows Clinton so well that when the President began delivering his health care speech to Congress, Gore, sitting behind him, knew instantly that something was wrong. "His voice was definitely higher in his chest." It turned out that the wrong speech was in the prompter.</p>
        <p>Quite a turnabout after the years in which Clinton and Gore had eyed one another suspiciously, believing two sons of the South could not become President. In 1991, at the height of President Bush's popularity, the Senator from Tennessee passed up what looked like a clear shot at the Democratic nomination. He says he needed to take a few steps away from the political arena after his 8-year-old son, Albert 3d, almost died after being hit by a car. That left the field open to the lesser-known Southerner, Clinton.</p>
        <p>Gore was surprised, and wary, when he got the call in the summer of 1992 to meet with Clinton and discuss joining the ticket. Though there was never open friction, Clinton had not endorsed Gore for the Democratic nomination in 1988 and four years later Gore had not endorsed Clinton. With Clinton running third in the polls behind Bush and Perot, Gore took what at the time was a big gamble. He decided that the best way for him to reach the White House was to suppress his own ambitions and plunge into the role of loyal sidekick, tying his future to Clinton's.</p>
        <p>From their first late-night meeting in a Washington hotel room, they hit it off. Gore was an interesting choice for Clinton; he did not bring geographic balance but did offer complementary experience plus youth and energy that Clinton thought would be appealing. After Gore's acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention, Clinton stepped to the podium to accept the nomination and said, "I am so proud of Al Gore."</p>
        <p>Gore's explanation for why he and Clinton have become friends sounds much like the reasons that had made them rivals: "We're of the same generation; we're from the same part of the country. We're from the same part of the same political party. We have long had similiar views on a wide range of issues. We both ran for President at a relatively young age." They also never ran against each other, so are not haunted by videotapes of one attacking the other. And, after all, they are peers, with Clinton only 19 months older. Dan Quayle was young enough to be George Bush's son.</p>
        <p>After the convention, Clinton and Gore were buoyed by an unexpectedly enthusiastic reponse to the first ticket of Ivy League baby boomers. On their campaign bus, they would rattle on hour after hour about policy minutiae. "We both joke about wonkdom," Gore says. They were Bob Hope and Bing Crosby in the road pictures -- far cries from Ike and Nixon or Kennedy and Johnson.</p>
        <p>Yet they are hardly copies of each other. Clinton, who always seems late, is much less disciplined than Gore. Gore stays on schedule and deliberates but does not dawdle over decisions. Clinton likes people around him. Gore cherishes solitude. Clinton is a night owl. Gore is early to bed -- though he's sometimes so driven that he wakes in the middle of the night and plunges into work. "My husband is very task oriented," Tipper Gore says. "When he has a task, you can just be assured he'll get it done. In terms of their personalities, I think Al is by nature more reserved. The President is more outgoing."</p>
        <p>When the pressures get particularly intense, Gore, a born-again Baptist, says he turns to religion, as he did before the Perot encounter. "When I'm in a situation like that, I pray about it," he says. "And if there's intense pressure, and I know in my heart it's the right thing, I pray that it will happen as it should, and I just then forget about the outcome and feel confident. And that may sound corny but that's the truth." Whitewater: Scout's Honor</p>
        <p>Gore, with his earnest, Boy Scout manner, was the obvious choice to lead in defending the Clintons against allegations of a conflict of interest in the Whitewater real-estate deal back when Clinton was Governor of Arkansas. The charges, says Gore, are motivated by Republican politics. Was this politician who even Republicans had to admit during the last campaign was Mr. Clean risking damage to his own reputation?</p>
        <p>This, among other things, brought Bob Dole, the Senate Republican leader, to a full boil at a recent news conference: "It's almost shameful the way he plugs the Administration."</p>
        <p>Gore insists that he has had "no problems at all defending the President." But behind the scenes he recommended that a special prosecutor be put on the case at least a week before the President relented.</p>
        <p>Could the White House have handled Whitewater better?</p>
        <p>"The answer is yes," Gore says. A Vice Presidential Dream?</p>
        <p>Though he would never admit it, Al Gore must imagine that things would run more smoothly in a Gore Administration. Take the troublesome nomination last spring of Lani Guinier to head the Justice Department's civil rights division. Gore did not think she should have been picked in the first place. But when the nomination prompted opposition, Clinton dillydallied. It was Gore who pressed him to read her law review articles and make a decision. When Clinton then dumped Guinier, Gore, ever dutiful, went on television in an unconvincing effort to defend the drawn-out decision.</p>
        <p>Does he want to be President?</p>
        <p>Gore stammered when a young woman posed the question at a town meeting last December in the most unexpected of places: Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, the former Soviet republic in central Asia.</p>
        <p>"Bill Clinton's dream was to be President of the United States. What about you? Do you dream to be President?"</p>
        <p>Gore laughed nervously.</p>
        <p>"Would you believe me if I told you that since I was a young child I dreamed of becoming Vice President of the United States?" he asked.</p>
        <p>After the translation, the crowd roared. But that response would not do and Gore tried another nonanswer:</p>
        <p>"I take one year at a time."</p>
        <p>The Vice President would have people believe that the moment he joined the Clinton ticket his own yearning for the Presidency ended. In the first of several interviews, this one aboard Air Force Two over the Rocky Mountains, Gore raised, then quickly dismissed, the notion that deep down he must think he would make a better President than his onetime competitor. Gore says that, because he did not run in 1992 "for reasons that were completely valid and with which I was completely comfortable, I never for a single moment have felt the emotion which I think some previous Vice Presidents have sometimes felt -- namely, that they could do better in a particular situation. I have always felt it really and truly a privilege to be able to serve in the exact position in which I'm now serving and to define it in the way I define it."</p>
        <p>The now-verboten subject did come up after Clinton first interviewed Gore about the Vice Presidency, and Gore and Downey roamed the Capitol grounds for hours one night. Downey said to Gore: "Look, if you want to be the President of the United States, this is a good place to start. He agreed with me. I remember going through the number of Vice Presidents who eventually became President." There are 14.</p>
        <p>There is no doubt that Gore's desire to reach the Presidency is less consuming than it was five years ago, before his son's accident, before he endured his version of a midlife crisis that led him to reorder priorities. These days, he thinks nothing of leaving work at 6 P.M. to watch his daughter playing field hockey.</p>
        <p>But at times Gore certainly sounds as if he is thinking about the year 2000. Taking a sip in the Square Office from his ever-present mug of herbal tea, he says: "Because the President is so generous in his definition of our partnership, I have gotten a pretty good taste of what that is really like. And on a daily basis." His chief of staff, Jack Quinn, is more explicit: "When and if Al Gore has the opportunity to run for President, he will do so with a very real record on which he will be judged, as opposed to other Vice Presidents who have been able only to run on the records of the Presidents they've served."</p>
        <p>A Gore Administration would fulfill the dream of his 86-year-old father, former Senator Albert Gore Sr., who once took his 12-year-old son to President John F. Kennedy's private office. "I had ambitions for the Presidency -- it didn't turn out that way," the elder Gore says wistfully. Will he live to see his son reach the Oval Office? "How could a father be more satisfied?" he asks. "I've been negotiating with the Lord to let me live to see that something like that happens. But I haven't been able to get a commitment yet."</p>
        <p>As for the commitment from Al Jr., consider the unambiguous words he spoke on the eve of the New Hampshire primary in 1992: "I'd like to be President and I look forward to the chance to run in the future." Politics vs. Theatrics</p>
        <p>Not everyone is sure that Al Gore is destined to be President. After his defeat in the 1988 primaries, the word among Democrats was that he wasn't ready -- and might never be. The doubts, over whether he is enough of a politician, persist. And a dreary night in Moscow illustrates why.</p>
        <p>Gore's handlers had flown halfway across the world to set up the perfect photo opportunity -- but the Vice President was not sticking to the script. For years, Gore had pressed to help Lubavitcher Jews in their quest to get the Russian State Library to release 12,000 sacred volumes that had been confiscated by the Soviet Government after the 1917 Revolution. Finally, last December, there he was in a dusty reading room at the library, where Russian officials were to give him one of the old texts in a grand gesture of accommodation.</p>
        <p>But Gore, wearing his customary blue suit (as usual, the pants too short), was too reserved to reach out and actually touch the prize he had won. An aide, Dennis Alpert, frantically motioned with his hands to pretend he was opening a book. Finally, Gore picked up the book, but even then did so in a lifeless way that deflated the poignant drama of the moment. "I was dying," recalls Steve Rabinowitz, a media consultant who had visited the library five times to set up the scene. "I was sending every thought to him that it was O.K. to pick up the book. You don't have to be Lubavitcher; you don't have to be Jewish."</p>
        <p>The failure to seize the excitement of the moment also was evident three months earlier, at a sound stage at Fox studios in Hollywood. The Environmental Media Awards, a banquet of journalists and Democratic celebrities, seemed a tailor-made event for a man who had begun his career as a newspaper reporter and had written a best-selling book, "Earth in the Balance," on the environment. Kindred spirits. The crowd had already been warmed up by Mariel Hemingway, Kenny Loggins and Candice Bergen. Gore got the perfect introduction: a replay of his appearance on "The Late Show with David Letterman." Then Gore took the stage to a tape of Paul Simon's "You Can Call Me Al," clapping awkwardly to the music like a marionette. It was a great moment to play off the Letterman routine with a memorable joke or even a light remark. Gore offered neither; he plunged directly into a numbing discourse on the global environment and spirituality.</p>
        <p>Afterward, his aides had excuses: he was tired. And after the Russian library peformance, Gore himself had an explanation: "I felt that the message I was communicating to the people who possessed the books was more important than the theatrics of it." He wanted to be respectful, he says, but also "not to seem overly eager to just grab hold of this symbolic transfer if only to underscore the fact that it was in fact only one."</p>
        <p>Whatever the reasons, it is easy to imagine Clinton conveying the drama of the Lubavitcher book without being coarse or whipping up the Hollywood crowd without abandoning a serious message. There is something endearing about Gore's inability to play the politician on cue. Some people find Clinton manipulative in the way he seems to be able to identify with every person he meets. Still, can Gore -- who needs to be reminded to shake hands at the rope line -- excite people when they need to be excited? Clown-Faced, Red-Faced</p>
        <p>Gore speaks with passion, but the passion is often about ideas and concepts and not human beings. Ask about his vision of the world and vital issues facing the country and he talks like a futurist. The biggest challenge, he says, is "establishing the proper relationship between our global civilization and the global environment." Also high on his list are "stabilizing world population growth" and completing the information superhighway by the year 2000." These are not goals that bring wild cheers.</p>
        <p>He seems happiest when he's learning or explaining an idea he has just learned. He stares in awe at a three-dimensional pyramid that came over a futuristic fax machine. He likes to work by himself in his office, sometimes to the New Age dreaminess of Enya, an Irish singer. On a trip over the Atlantic, he races excitedly down the aisle of Air Force Two like a little boy, waking up everyone to see the northern lights. "It's the aurora borealis!" he exclaims. At his weekly environmental breakfast, Gore is distracted from the conversation; his head is buried in a National Geographic article on water projects.</p>
        <p>Gore knows he does not relate to the masses the way Clinton does. He says that is what he has learned most from the President. "I've certainly learned a lot about empathy. It's very moving to see him connect with Americans who feel strongly about what our country is doing."</p>
        <p>What is confounding here is that, public formality notwithstanding, he has appealing informality in private. Though he is finding it harder to hide a bald spot, he still has the wholesome looks of a soap-opera doctor. When the cameras are gone, Gore's wry humor, long on verbal double takes and pretended insults, can amuse a room. At the Halloween party at his residence, he had his face painted like a clown and looked utterly at ease as he mingled with friends' children and pulled them onto the dance floor. "I've seen him walk into a room and have everyone in hysterics," says Paul Begala, a political adviser to Clinton, "and then walk into a different room with Tom Brokaw and sound like Kaw-liga the Wooden Indian."</p>
        <p>The sense of public formality was plain on the Gores' recent Russia trip. Particularly in contrast to Tipper. In Moscow, the two of them sat in a television studio between interviews. At the urging of a magazine photographer who had complained that he had not caught any displays of affection between them, Mrs. Gore began planting kisses on her husband's lips. By the third smooch, his face had turned bright red and he whispered sternly, "We're on satellite!"</p>
        <p>Has Clinton ever counseled his Vice President to loosen up? "You know, he has loosened up," the President says. "He's like all the rest of us. Sometimes when he's got a wooden style it's because he's tired. Privately, he's very droll. Sometimes when I say something off the wall, he looks at me with this straight face and says, 'I agree with everything you say, Mr. President,' when I know he means exactly the reverse." The President laughs uproariously.</p>
        <p>Some suggest that Gore's compartmentalized personality is not a matter of political style but a reaction to having been raised in a household where his parents held out high expectations but were not always around to help him meet them.  "He had built up this kind of very achieving dedicated life which was a defense against the need for personal embracing," says Tim Wirth, who as a Senator from Colorado worked closely with Gore on the Hill. "He has a very hard time letting people be friends of his. Once you get inside, it's wonderful." Reinventing the Persona</p>
        <p>The Vice President is working on the problem.</p>
        <p>He made a celebrated effort to bring out the private clown in his Letterman appearance last September. Never one to make a move without deliberate preparation, Gore had his aides approach Letterman, offer to appear on the show and enter careful negotiations to make certain that he would come off fun-loving yet dignified.</p>
        <p>"I told him, 'Here's the opportunity to show people you have a sense of humor,' " says Daniel Kellison, who produced the Gore segment. "He agreed."</p>
        <p>Gore (with generous kibitzing from his advisers) came equipped with his own Top 10 list -- "The Good Things About Being Vice President." One of his favorites: "If you close your left eye, the seal on the podium reads, 'President of the United States.' " He smashed Government-issue ashtrays. He was relaxed, self-deprecating and played his role just right.</p>
        <p>"When I saw the audience giving him a standing ovation, that's when I realized he had reinvented himself," says Peter Lassally, an executive producer for Letterman. (Lassally concedes, incidentally, that they had really wanted another politician. "Hillary," he says, "was always our first choice." But she said no until two weeks ago, when the First Lady agreed to be interviewed at the Olympics by Letterman's mother.)</p>
        <p>The Perot encounter, the brainchild of Jack Quinn, also helped make Gore look more human. It didn't hurt his reputation inside the White House, either. Until then, some Clinton aides still doubted Gore's effectiveness and loyalty because they felt he had inadequately defended Clinton against Dan Quayle in the Vice Presidential campaign debate. "Gore doesn't project any kind of image that we associate with effective communication in the mass media," says Walter Dean Burnham, a political science professor at the University of Texas. "But he did efficiently with Perot, so he may be developing talents along those lines."</p>
        <p>Knowing that he has a long way to go before he can stir a crowd, Gore recently resorted to shtick to spice up a speech on telecommunications in Los Angeles. He brought Lily Tomlin on stage as Ernestine, the one-ringy-dingy telephone operator. The audience loved it. But soon after Tomlin walked off, Gore was deep into his plodding delivery.</p>
        <p>It is as if Gore cannot shake a deeply ingrained patrician sense of how a gentleman is supposed to behave in public. "It goes back to my father -- a tradition that has emphasized a little more formality in the public presentation," he says. "But I think I'm growing out of it." Feeling His Way To Leadership</p>
        <p>While other politicians consult pollsters or image makers to help them connect, Gore turns to Jane H. Hopkins, a management consultant. She was the facilitator of a get-in-touch-with-your-feelings retreat at Camp David for Clinton, Gore and the Cabinet after they took office. She now advises the Vice President and his staff of 80 about how to get along better with one another, for a fee of roughly $3,000 a month. Two days a week, Hopkins travels from her home in Richmond to the Vice President's office and meets regularly with Gore.</p>
        <p>Such consultants have been the rage in corporate circles for years. But Hopkins is the first to be given such a big role inside the White House. "I kind of dive into every aspect of the office," Hopkins says. "I might dive into correspondence at one point -- or how the national security group is organized."</p>
        <p>The Vice President's reliance on Hopkins, and another consultant, Carolyn Lukensmeyer, for his reinventing Government project shows how self-aware he is, how he wants to improve himself, to motivate his staff. But perhaps it also reflects a certain unsureness, someone still grasping for clues on how to express himself. That raises another, larger question: If the Vice President needs a management theorist to communicate to his staff, can he communicate effectively to the nation? "I'm sure at some point someone told him, 'Al, this is a little weird,' and he said, 'I don't care because it's the right thing to do,' " says Gore's friend Carter Eskew, a Democratic strategist.</p>
        <p>One of Hopkins's tasks was to calm tensions that had arisen back during the Russia trip between the Vice President's advance staff, which handled the logistics of the trip, and his national security assistants, who dealt with policy. The differences, while petty, had threatened to become poisonous, over such issues as how the precious seats were divvied up on Air Force Two. After the staff returned home, Hopkins heard about all that went wrong.</p>
        <p>So she called a meeting. She sat in a high-ceilinged conference room at the Old Executive Office Building, listening to gripes from nearly 20 staff members. It was called a Russia debriefing, but it was closer to a sensitivity session. The discussion was mostly courteous and Hopkins made sure everyone had their say. From time to time, she went to an easel and wrote "suggestions" for the future, like "Meeting before pre-advance and determine players, roles, etc." Participants later said it was good to have talked things out, though they were still a little wary of each other.</p>
        <p>Hopkins says Gore seems to have changed in recent years. "There's a maturity there that is different. It's a thoughtfulness and wisdom and confidence. It's a focus." As part of what she calls his personal journey, she recommended "On Becoming a Leader" by Warren Bennis, a professor of business administration at the University of Southern California. Gore says it is "not a book that I live my life by," yet it has become required (or, at least, highly recommended) reading for his advisers. But that creates a possible paradox. Are people who need to follow the advice of someone else, about how to become a leader, by definition followers?</p>
        <p>Of obvious interest to Gore, the book dismisses many recent Presidents as uninspired. "Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter could be described as self-made men," Bennis writes, "but they failed to win our hearts or engage our minds, and finally failed as leaders." Each of them, he writes, failed because "each seemed trapped in his own shadows."</p>
        <p>For Gore, the task is to prove that there is real leadership within him, that he can escape the shadows, his own and those of others. He clearly has grown and he has the time, desire and energy to grow more. He defends Hopkins as part of that process. "Is it healthy to talk about who you are? Sure it is. To talk about what's important to you? Of course it is. Why wouldn't it be?" At times, when he talks about motivational theory, say, or informational innovation, Gore sounds more like a far-out visionary than a politician. And visionaries who are out of touch with the people do not often get elected President.</p>
        <p>His former communications director, Marla Romash, sees it another way. She says Gore's visions of the future are just far-out enough and make him "the perfect President for the year 2000." There is, of course, another possibility: that Al Gore was born to be the best Vice President.  Richard L. Berke covers national politics for The New York Times.</p>
