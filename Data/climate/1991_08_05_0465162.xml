        <p>For close to 20 years, the clean, cheap power generated by Canada's dams has been the solution whenever New York's utilities have looked for more electricity. Now, pressure is mounting on the state and the Consolidated Edison Company to put their long-term investments into something even cleaner and possibly cheaper: conservation.</p>
        <p>Mayor David N. Dinkins plans to ask New York State today to delay signing a new contract that would provide Con Ed with large amounts of hydroelectricity from Canada from 1995 to 2016. His administration says that the $6.1 billion that the contract would cost Con Ed would be better spent on subsidies to businesses and homeowners to adopt a variety of energy-saving devices. Investing in conservation and buying electricity from small independent generators, city officials say, would be cheaper and possibly more secure.</p>

        <p>For close to 20 years, the clean, cheap power generated by Canada's dams has been the solution whenever New York's utilities have looked for more electricity. Now, pressure is mounting on the state and the Consolidated Edison Company to put their long-term investments into something even cleaner and possibly cheaper: conservation.</p>
        <p>Mayor David N. Dinkins plans to ask New York State today to delay signing a new contract that would provide Con Ed with large amounts of hydroelectricity from Canada from 1995 to 2016. His administration says that the $6.1 billion that the contract would cost Con Ed would be better spent on subsidies to businesses and homeowners to adopt a variety of energy-saving devices. Investing in conservation and buying electricity from small independent generators, city officials say, would be cheaper and possibly more secure.</p>
        <p>Con Edison is already planning to spend $4.1 billion over the next 17 years on conservation programs intended to save 26 percent of its current generating capacity, a savings of five times as much power as the hydroelectric contract would bring. But as New York State approaches a deadline to complete the Canadian contract, utility officials say they are not sure they can rely on conservation to achieve more than they have already planned.</p>
        <p>Rejecting new hydroelectric purchases in favor of more conservation would be a huge change in the state's energy policy.</p>
        <p>While utilities around the country have recently moved heavily into promoting energy efficiency rather than new construction, and while the New York Public Service Commission has made it financially attractive for utilities here to do the same, the real decisions have not confronted Con Ed yet. The utility began the 1990's with surplus capacity and has not thus far used increased efficiency as a substitute for pouring concrete or signing new contracts with suppliers.</p>
        <p>Howard F. Squadron, the city's Commissioner of Telecommunications and Energy, described the city's argument in an interview as "part of an overall turn in the road," in which the way electricity is used has become as important as the way it is generated.  How Much 'Enlightened Energy'</p>
        <p>But the company has a marked reluctance to rely on more demand-side management, as efficiency is known in the industry, than it has already planned for in its current campaign, called Enlightened Energy.</p>
        <p>The company plans to spend $73 million on promoting conservation this year, which is equal to about 10 percent of its capital budget, and $4.2 billion between now and 2008.</p>
        <p>"The issue on Enlightened Energy is how much more you can get," said John E. Deegan Jr., senior vice president of the company.</p>
        <p>Among other goals, Con Ed already plans to subsidize or otherwise encourage the replacement of 89 percent of the commercial and industrial lighting in its 660-square-mile service territory, along with 64 percent of the commercial electric air conditioners and 60 percent of the residential refrigerators. Like an Extra Indian Point</p>
        <p>By 2008 Enlightened Energy is supposed to reduce the summer peak load by 2,425 megawatts and winter load by 955 megawatts. (The summer effect is higher because Con Ed has focused its efforts on summer demand, which is higher, and its steps to make air conditioners more efficient and switch some air conditioners to steam or gas power do nothing to affect winter demand.)</p>
        <p>Stated differently, conservation by 2008 will give Con Edison as much electricity in winter as another Indian Point nuclear plant would. In summer, it would be like having another Indian Point plus another Astoria complex.</p>
        <p>These gains are far larger than anything Con Ed has tried before, and utility experts outside the company are not certain they are possible.</p>
        <p>"They probably won't get everything they want to get, but they'll get a good chunk of it," said William J. Balet, the executive director of the New York Power Pool, a utility consortium that helps plan power supplies and arrange power transfers between utilities. It may be 10 years, he said, before it is clear how much power is available through conservation.</p>
        <p>Con Edison has gone after efficiency improvements in part because it can make a big profit that way. In addition to selling high-efficiency light bulbs at subsidized rates, it is offering businesses subsidies if they will replace motors, air conditioners and lights with equipment that does the same work for less power. The initial response has been good from businesses and nearly overwhelming from residences, where 106,000 customers have taken up the utility on its offer to sell cut-rate bulbs that use only 25 percent of the electricity used by regular ones.</p>
        <p>On the commercial side, Con Ed is helping big buildings in Manhattan pay for installing air-conditioning equipment run by steam or natural gas, both of which are in surplus in summer.</p>
        <p>Although Con Ed loses money on each bulb it sells, it can recover its expenses through electric rates, both for the subsidies it pays and for the lost profits on power it no longer sells. And if it passes certain milestones in energy conservation, it is allowed to earn a higher rate of return on the money its shareholders have invested in the electric system.</p>
        <p>The State Power Authority is nearing the December deadline to decide whether to give final approval to the contract to import 1,000 megawatts from Hydro Quebec. In the past, the utility, which is owned by the province, has supplied up to 10 percent of the state's electricity in normal years.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. Squadron said that Mr. Dinkins would send a letter today to Richard F. Flynn, the chairman of the Power Authority, seeking a delay in the deadline for approving the contract, to leave time for more analysis of economic and environmental issues. Electricity Market Changed</p>
        <p>Negotiations began in the late 1980's and a preliminary version was signed in 1989. Since then, the electricity market has changed substantially, with conservation measures and independent producers put into direct competition with traditional generators.</p>
        <p>While the cumulative goal of Enlightened Energy is huge, the proposed Hydro Quebec contract would also represent a large chunk of electricity for the state, more than the Indian Point 2 reactor provides. At 1,000 megawatts, it could be the largest block of energy added in the state in this decade.</p>
        <p>Under the contract, the New York Power Authority would sell 200 megawatts to its government customers in southeastern New York, including the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Port Authority and the New York City Housing Authority; 482 megawatts to Con Ed, 218 megawatts to the Long Island Lighting Company, and 100 megawatts to Orange and Rockland Utilities. The Public Service Commission began hearings last week on Con Ed's request for a rate increase, and the role of the proposed contract may come up in testimony this week.</p>
        <p>The agreement would run for 21 years, beginning in May 1995. Con Ed's cost would be $6.1 billion. New Savings Estimates</p>
        <p>Mr. Flynn, the chairman of the Power Authority, once predicted that the contract would save New Yorkers $1 billion. But a spokesman for the authority said last week that with changes since the signing in 1989, that savings estimate was no longer valid, although the savings would still be substantial.</p>
        <p>The city bases its calculations on the costs and savings for Con Ed, assuming that the findings will hold true for the whole contract. The city estimates that one kilowatt of electricity -- the amount needed to keep 10 100-watt light bulbs burning -- will cost $3,551 through the 21 years of the contract with Hydro Quebec, and $721 through energy savings.</p>
        <p>Con Edison calculates the cost differently and reaches a different result, with the energy from Hydro Quebec coming out cheaper. But Con Ed does not dispute the city's method.</p>
        <p>Last Thursday, the New York State Energy Office, Public Service Commission and Department of Environmental Conservation jointly released a draft of their New York State Energy Master Plan, which said that a new contract with Hydro Quebec could raise rates slightly. Debate on Which Plan Is Cleaner</p>
        <p>But shunning the contract, the report said, would increase use of coal, natural gas and imported oil, along with emissions of sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain, nitrogen oxide, which contributes to smog, and carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming.</p>
        <p>City officials, on the other hand, argue that increased reliance on conservation and independent power producers could be used to sidestep the nagging environmental questions about new dams in northern Quebec, at a price lower than what the Canadian power would cost.</p>
        <p>Environmental groups have been fighting against the contract. The contract is not tied to any particular project, but would lead Hydro Quebec to build new dams near Hudson Bay to generate the power, flooding the hunting grounds of the Cree Indians.</p>
        <p>New York first seriously sought hydroelectric power from Canada after the oil shock of 1973-74, and again after the oil shortage of 1979. In recent years as much as 40 percent of the state's electricity has come from oil, far higher than the national average. But last year, electricity came in almost equal parts from oil, coal, natural gas, hydroelectricity and nuclear reactors. Natural gas use seems poised to increase in coming years, with new pipelines and new constraints on utilities under the Clean Air Act. Nuclear power will not expand in this decade. Hydroelectricity depends in part on rainfall; this year, New York took very little from Canada because of a drought there.</p>
        <p>Reflecting the changed nature of the utility business, in an interview last week at his office at Con Edison, Mr. Deegan spoke at length about conservation and purchases from other electricity producers. The company began to assemble land on the Hudson River more than a decade ago to build a new generating station of its own some day, but neither Mr. Deegan nor a longtime spokesman for the company, Daniel Walden, could remember at first where the land was. It is in Red Hook.</p>
        <p>Con Ed's newest plant, the Indian Point 2 reactor, went into commercial operation 17 years ago this month.</p>
