        <p>How Asteroids Jump</p>
        <p>Most asteroids lead a benign existence, content to linger in their main belt between Mars and Jupiter, following an elliptical orbit around the Sun. But some wind up nearer Earth, where the potential for a disastrous collision inspires fear and film scripts.</p>
        <p>Exactly how an asteroid jumps across Mars orbit to near-Earth space has always been something of a mystery. Now, scientists from Italy and the Czech Republic, writing in the journal Science, offer an explanation of how small asteroids and asteroid fragments make the leap.</p>
        <p>In doing so, the scientists have dusted off a phenomenon first described a century ago. It is called the Yarkovsky effect, for the Russian engineer who discovered it, and holds that spinning bodies warmed by sunlight gain heat in a nonuniform manner, which in turn leads to small orbital shifts.</p>
        <p>Using simulations, the scientists showed that over millions of years, the effect can cause an asteroid's semimajor axis (half the long axis of the ellipse) to drift a few million miles or so. That is enough to bring some asteroids in the inner part of the main belt close enough to Mars that other forces take over, slinging the rocks into orbits that bring them near Earth.</p>
        <p>Africa Parting</p>
        <p>A more down-to-Earth drift concerns two scientists at Rice University, who have provided further understanding of how the earth's crust is moving in Africa, where things are coming apart.</p>
        <p>The split is occurring at the East African rift, a 2,400-mile zone that runs north-south from Djibouti to Mozambique and is dramatically revealed in the rift valleys of Kenya and Tanzania. The zone is the boundary of two tectonic plates, the Nubian in the west and the Somalian in the east.</p>
        <p>But the boundary continues south of the zone, where there is no evidence of rifting. The Rice scientists, who reported on their work in the journal Nature, found the first evidence of movement in this part of the boundary, in the Indian Ocean where the two plates meet a third, the Antarctic plate. Their findings explain why there is no evidence of a split south of the rift zone: in this area, the two plates are converging.</p>
        <p>By studying measurements of sea floor spreading, the scientists determined that the Nubian and Somalian plates are rotating slightly with respect to each other, so that the same force that is causing the plates to separate in the rift zone at a rate of about one-quarter of an inch a year is making them come together, at a slightly slower rate, at the southern end.</p>
        <p>The Skin as Lungs</p>
        <p>Who needs lungs? Not a tiny Australian mouse that in its first days after birth breathes mostly through its skin.</p>
        <p>The mouse, a marsupial called the Julia Creek dunnart that lives among cracks in the bone-dry soil of northeastern Australia, produces offspring that are among the smallest newborn mammals known, about one-sixth of an inch long and weighing slightly more than half an ounce.</p>
        <p>The newborn mouse is not very well developed, with cartilage for bones and a small number of spherical air sacs for lungs. In the first few days after birth, the animal's body movements do not seem to expand the air sacs appreciably.</p>
        <p>But that does not seem to matter, according to the Canadian and Australian researchers who studied the animal and reported on their findings in Nature. The young mouse's skin is hairless and rich in blood, providing a convenient means for gas exchange.</p>
        <p>Using an apparatus that included a tiny jury-rigged mask to cover the mouse's mouth and nostrils, the researchers measured the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide both through the sacs and through the skin. For mice up to about four ounces in weight, respiration through the skin exceeded that through the lungs. As the mice grew more, the lungs took over; at three weeks old and about 10 ounces, exchange through the skin was about a third that through the lungs.</p>
        <p>Correction:  March 10, 1999, Wednesday  A report in the Observatory column of Science Times yesterday about a tiny mouse that breathes through its skin after birth misstated its weight. It weighs about 6 10-thousandths of an ounce at birth, not half an ounce, and about one-hundredth of an ounce at three weeks, not 10 ounces.</p>
