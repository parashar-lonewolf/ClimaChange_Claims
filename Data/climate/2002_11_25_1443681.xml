        <p>The environmental community, already battered by two years of struggle with the Bush administration, is expecting the perfect storm when the 108th Congress convenes in January.</p>
        <p>For starters, the chairmanship of two key Senate committees will pass from two reliable conservationists to men with deplorable records on energy and the environment, James Inhofe of Oklahoma and Pete Domenici of New Mexico. Second, the election results are likely to encourage the administration's quiet but lethal efforts to undermine environmental law through administrative rulemaking and judicial negotiation. Finally, and most depressingly, it is hard to imagine a scenario in which this group comes up with any new and imaginative initiatives to deal with problems that badly need attention, especially global warming. Most people who care about such things will be so busy preventing further rollbacks that the idea of moving forward will seem hopelessly farfetched.</p>

        <p>The environmental community, already battered by two years of struggle with the Bush administration, is expecting the perfect storm when the 108th Congress convenes in January.</p>
        <p>For starters, the chairmanship of two key Senate committees will pass from two reliable conservationists to men with deplorable records on energy and the environment, James Inhofe of Oklahoma and Pete Domenici of New Mexico. Second, the election results are likely to encourage the administration's quiet but lethal efforts to undermine environmental law through administrative rulemaking and judicial negotiation. Finally, and most depressingly, it is hard to imagine a scenario in which this group comes up with any new and imaginative initiatives to deal with problems that badly need attention, especially global warming. Most people who care about such things will be so busy preventing further rollbacks that the idea of moving forward will seem hopelessly farfetched.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the situation today seems virtually identical to what it was in 1995, when Newt Gingrich and his Contract With America Republicans swept into town determined to reverse 30 years of bipartisan environmental law protecting the country's air, water and wilderness. With this crucial difference: Bill Clinton isn't in the White House anymore.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's vetoes and well-timed veto threats were crucial in turning back the Gingrich tide. That won't happen with this president. From day one, Mr. Bush has pursued an antiregulatory agenda unmatched since the Reagan years, filling key positions with industry lobbyists and using whatever justification seems handy to ease up on industry. Last summer's forest fires, for example, became an excuse to try to suspend environmental reviews of logging projects. The California energy crisis (and, later, the fear of increasing dependence on Middle Eastern oil) have been invoked to justify pell-mell exploration for relatively trivial amounts of oil and gas on fragile Western lands, often in plain violation of environmental rules.</p>
        <p>The administration's determined efforts to satisfy its corporate allies at the expense of the environment show no signs of abating. On Friday, it unilaterally relaxed the rules governing pollution from old coal-fired power plants without putting any new and improved rules in their place. Meanwhile, a story in Friday's Times disclosed that the Interior Department has authorized new drilling projects in Padre Island National Seashore adjacent to the Gulf of Mexico -- a sensitive landscape that is also home to an endangered breed of sea turtle. Such is this administration's appetite for extractable resources that no area seems safe.</p>
        <p>Until now, legal action by advocacy groups and oversight by Senate Democrats have helped slow the onslaught. But the election has relegated the Democrats to a secondary role. Instead of James Jeffords, the Vermont independent who votes with the Democrats, we now have Mr. Inhofe as chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. A reliable advocate for oil and gas interests, Mr. Inhofe is also a longtime critic of the Clean Air Act whose dismal ratings on environmental issues set him apart from the pro-environment Republicans who have run the committee in the past.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists find Mr. Domenici, the new Energy Committee chairman, even more threatening, partly because he is such a skilled legislator. In 1995, he contrived to attach a provision opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling to a budget reconciliation bill, causing a government shutdown when President Clinton vetoed the bill. Mr. Domenici is certain to go after the Arctic again, and other public lands as well.</p>
        <p>If there is any real chance of avoiding legislative disaster it rests with a handful of responsible Republican senators. These include Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, Peter Fitzgerald of Illinois and -- on a few issues -- John McCain of Arizona and Gordon Smith of Oregon. Working together and in tandem with the Democrats, they can reject President Bush's zealots and, with any luck, begin to steer their party back to its Rooseveltian traditions of strong environmental stewardship.</p>
        <p>There is an honorable precedent for such a coalition. In 1995, a band of moderates in the House organized in large part by Sherwood Boehlert of New York beat back the worst of the Gingrich environmental agenda. Relying on such a small band of legislators to buck their own president is a precarious hedge against further environmental damage. But it is the best hope the country has right now.</p>
