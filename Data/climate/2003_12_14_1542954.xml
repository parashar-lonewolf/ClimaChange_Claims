        <p>We all know the drawbacks of fossil fuels, like our dependence on a dwindling resource buried inconveniently in the Middle East. We also know we generate too much trash. So wouldn't the world be a better place if we could solve both problems at once and turn garbage into oil?</p>
        <p>As it happens, this transformation has just begun, for real, at a Butterball turkey plant in Carthage, Mo. In September a new $25-million factory started turning castoff feathers, guts and bones into energy. ConAgra Foods, which owns Butterball, put up half the money; if all goes well, by late next month, 200 tons of turkey per day will become fertilizer, a heating-grade oil, a powdered carbon suitable for home water filters and, as a bonus, enough natural gas to power the process.</p>

        <p>As it happens, this transformation has just begun, for real, at a Butterball turkey plant in Carthage, Mo. In September a new $25-million factory started turning castoff feathers, guts and bones into energy. ConAgra Foods, which owns Butterball, put up half the money; if all goes well, by late next month, 200 tons of turkey per day will become fertilizer, a heating-grade oil, a powdered carbon suitable for home water filters and, as a bonus, enough natural gas to power the process.</p>
        <p>Engineers since the 20's have known how to convert biomass into fuel, but no one has ever figured out how to do it profitably. Government research dollars pushed the science along starting in the 70's, and by the early 90's, Paul Baskis, an Illinois biologist and inventor, had made several crucial leaps. Baskis's thermal depolymerization (TDP) mimics the way magma in the earth's crust turns fossils into fuels, but it does so in a matter of hours instead of millennia. An entrepreneur named Brian Appel became a majority holder of Baskis's patents and in 1997 formed a company called Changing World Technologies to try to make TDP commercially viable.</p>
        <p>In addition to the turkeys in Missouri, Appel has plans for Alabama chicken droppings, Colorado cow stomachs and Nevada restaurant grease. Appel estimates that U.S. agricultural waste alone could yield 4 billion barrels of oil annually -- almost enough to replace imports.</p>
        <p>TDP doesn't produce a clean energy, of course, but it would give some relief to the atmosphere. Left to rot, agricultural refuse gives off methane, one of the worst of the greenhouse gases. Converted to oil and burned, the same refuse produces carbon dioxide instead. Not perfect, but better.</p>
        <p>TDP does have limitations. The oil produced by the process is still more expensive than fossil fuels, and, according to Appel and Daniel Kammen, an expert in energy science at the University of California, it could become even more costly if the waste streams aren't rigorously separated. If you mix turkey parts with car tires, for example, the process becomes less efficient. But economies of scale, meaning more and bigger plants, could cut costs, and projects like the one Appel is now testing for Philadelphia's raw sewage promise a steady supply of fuel. So the day might yet come when we'll turn everything we don't want into the very stuff that, like it or not, makes our world go around.</p>
