        <p>THERE is yet another possible explanation for the catastrophe that befell Earth 65 million years ago, wiping out the dinosaurs and countless other species. The agent of destruction might have been a global haze of sulfuric acid that blocked sunlight and plunged the planet into a dark, killing chill lasting decades.</p>
        <p>This new hypothesis stems from geological studies of a buried crater in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, a giant scar as much as 180 miles wide that is widely believed to be the site where a huge asteroid collided with Earth just before the time of the dinosaur extinctions. Geologists found the rock in the crater, named Chicxulub, to be unusually rich in sulfur. If it had not been, they concluded, the dinosaurs might well have survived the impact, thereby changing the course of evolution.</p>
        <p>In a detailed analysis, geologists and atmospheric physicists determined that the asteroid, estimated to be 6 to 12 miles wide, would have vaporized much of the sulfur and spewed more than 100 billion tons of it into the air. This would have filled the air with sulfur dioxide in the lower altitudes, casting a pall reeking of the Devil's own brimstone, and also a sulfuric acid haze in the upper atmosphere, the result of interactions between solar ultraviolet radiation and sulfur dioxide.</p>
        <p>The dust and soot from most of the debris would have drifted back to Earth within six months, presumably too short a time for any global darkness to have caused the mass extinctions. But in a report in the current issue of the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters, scientists said the lighter sulfur particles would have stayed aloft and created a dense haze covering the entire planet for at least a decade, perhaps 20 or 30 years.</p>
        <p>From their computer simulations, the scientists concluded that sunlight would have been diminished by as much as 20 percent, and this would have cooled the surface 20 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
        <p>Such sharp climatic change persisting over decades "subjected organisms all over the world to long-term stresses to which they could not adapt in such a brief time span," said Dr. Kevin O. Pope, a geologist who heads Geo Eco Arc Research, a private research company in La Canada, Calif., who is one of the authors of the report.</p>
        <p>Another member of the research team, Dr. Kevin H. Baines, an atmospheric physicist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said, "If this asteroid had struck almost any other place on Earth, it wouldn't have generated the tremendous amount of sulfur that was spewed into the atmosphere to create such a devastating, worldwide climate change."</p>
        <p>Because the mass extinctions 65 million years ago cleared the way for the rise of mammals, Dr. Baines observed, "In fact, we human beings owe our existence to the uniqueness of this impact region."</p>
        <p>Dr. Baines, who has specialized in studies of the thick atmosphere of Venus, said the sulfuric acid clouds on Earth after the impact would have been much like those that perpetually envelop Venus. But there would have been one important difference. Earth turned cold because so much sunlight was reflected off the clouds. The surface of Venus is hot enough to melt lead because, though sunlight is reflected, the light that filters through becomes trapped by the predominantly carbon dioxide atmosphere, which creates the greenhouse effect.</p>
        <p>Other members of the research team included Adriana C. Ocampo, a planetary geologist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory who explored the crater site, and Dr. Boris A. Ivanov of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow, who made calculations of the dynamics of the impact that caused the crater.</p>
        <p>Paleontologists who specialize in dinosaur research said the new hypothesis seemed plausible and certainly addressed a critical question about the widely held theory that an asteroid collision contributed to the mass extinctions. Scientists have had a hard time explaining how any global darkness from debris clouds after such an impact could have lasted long enough to cause the widespread extinctions.</p>
        <p>The idea that an extraterrestrial object, either an asteroid or comet, was responsible for the extinctions was introduced in 1980 by Dr. Walter Alvarez, a geologist at the University of California at Berkeley. His primary evidence was unusually large amounts of the rare metal iridium found worldwide in sediments laid down about the time of the dinosaur extinction. Iridium is much more common in asteroids and comets than on Earth.</p>
        <p>It took almost a decade for scientists to identify the crater that most probably was gouged out by the collision. Dr. Pope was one of the scientists who first suggested Chicxulub as the site. Recent exploration has turned up boulders the size of a small car, blown out of the Yucatan crater and hurled more than 220 miles to the south in Belize. Seismic reverberations from the impact, some theorists now propose, could have touched off volcanic eruptions on the other side of the world, fouling the environment with even more deadly effect.</p>
        <p>With the new findings, support for the impact theory has become overwhelming. In a telephone interview, Dr. Alvarez said this shifted research into a new phase.</p>
        <p>"It's quite reasonable to say we have the crater," he said, "and this new research is an example of how, by looking at the bedrock, we can infer what the consequences of the impact might have been."</p>
