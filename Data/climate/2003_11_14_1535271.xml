        <p>Dr. J. Craig Venter, the scientist whose company decoded the human genome sequence, said he had developed a new technique for synthesizing DNA and used it to reconstitute the DNA of a virus that attacks bacteria. The new technique was better than existing methods, Dr. Venter said. A colleague, Dr. Hamilton Smith, said the new technique could probably be used, in combination with another method, to regenerate viable smallpox from the virus's published DNA sequence. They spoke at a news conference held by Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, who speculated that someday synthesized microbes might generate hydrogen and remove carbon dioxide from the air.</p>
