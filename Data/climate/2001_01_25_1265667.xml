        <p>YUGOSLAVIA: PROSECUTOR GREETED BY EGGS -- Carla del Ponte, chief prosecutor of the United Nations war crimes tribunal in The Hague, was pelted with eggs thrown by supporters of the former president of Yugoslavia, Slobodan Milosevic, as she drove away from a meeting in Belgrade. The prosecutor met with Yugoslav cabinet ministers on the second day of her three-day visit to seek cooperation on war crimes prosecutions.</p>

        <p>YUGOSLAVIA: PROSECUTOR GREETED BY EGGS -- Carla del Ponte, chief prosecutor of the United Nations war crimes tribunal in The Hague, was pelted with eggs thrown by supporters of the former president of Yugoslavia, Slobodan Milosevic, as she drove away from a meeting in Belgrade. The prosecutor met with Yugoslav cabinet ministers on the second day of her three-day visit to seek cooperation on war crimes prosecutions.</p>

        <p>RUSSIA: IMMUNITY PARED -- The lower house of Parliament sharply pared back a Kremlin proposal that would grant former Russian presidents virtually complete immunity from criminal prosecution, including broad protection from searches. The legislation would lock into law a decree issued by President Vladimir V. Putin granting immunity to Boris N. Yeltsin. But legislators approved a revised bill that would allow Parliament to lift prosecutorial immunity by a simple majority vote.</p>

        <p>RUSSIA: JEWISH LEADER HELD -- The St. Petersburg police arrested the local head of the Russian Jewish Congress and charged him with kidnapping two people in a case they implied was linked to struggles within the city's crime-ridden business world. Mikhail Mirilashvili also operates Russkoye Video, which runs a St. Petersburg television station in league with Media-Most, the media empire under legal attack by the Kremlin. Prosecutors said the arrest was unrelated to the Media-Most cases.</p>

        <p>RUSSIA: FEBRUARY PULLBACK -- The Russian military said the first army units would be withdrawn from Chechnya starting in mid-February. On Monday, President Vladimir V. Putin ordered the F.S.B., the domestic security service, to take over command of operations in the region. He ordered combined forces to be cut back to an army division of 15,000 and an Interior Ministry brigade of about 7,000.</p>

        <p>NETHERLANDS: GLOBAL WARMING PLEA -- The Bush administration has requested a two-month postponement of the next round of international talks aimed at completing a treaty to fight global warming, a State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher, said. The request was made to Jan Pronk, the Dutch environment minister, who is president of the talks, Mr. Boucher said. According to Agence France-Presse, a Pronk spokeswoman said he viewed the request as a ''positive sign.'' The spokeswoman said Washington asked for the delay ''to better prepare'' for the talks, which were scheduled for May.</p>

        <p>CANADA: CHRETIEN HINT -- Prime Minister Jean Chretien, in a veiled warning to younger rivals, has suggested he might run for a fourth term, a feat not accomplished in Canadian politics since 1908. Although Mr. Chretien, 67, easily won a third term last November, supporters of Paul Martin, the 62-year-old finance minister, are pushing the governing Liberal Party to hold a leadership review 14 months from now.</p>

        <p>COSTA RICA: SENTENCE IN SLAYINGS -- A Costa Rican man was sentenced to 70 years in prison for killing two American women last March. Alberto Urbina Cisneros, 19, was convicted of killing Emily Eagen of Ann Arbor, Mich., and Emily Howell of Lexington, Ky., both 19 years old. The crime shocked Costa Rica, a popular tourism and retirement destination with a reputation for safety. A 16-year-old boy was previously sentenced for his role in the killings, and officials are still searching for a third suspect, who is believed to be from Nicaragua.</p>

        <p>CONGO: PRESIDENT APPROVED -- The inauguration of the new president, Joseph Kabila, was postponed until today, a day later than initially planned. But members of Parliament, who were appointed last year by the slain president, Laurent D. Kabila, voted unanimously to approve his son as the new head of state.</p>

        <p>ASIA</p>
        <p>NORTH KOREA: GERMANY SEEKS TIES -- The German government said it was opening talks with North Korea aimed at setting up diplomatic relations. A spokesman added that Berlin expected North Korea to make further progress in building ties with South Korea, improving human rights and preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction.</p>

        <p>MONGOLIA: U.N. AID PLEA -- The United Nations is appealing for further aid to assist Mongolia through a harsh winter that has already killed 500,000 head of livestock and seems likely to kill several million more. Carolyn McAskie, the United Nations emergency relief coordinator, who just returned from Mongolia, said heavy snows, ice and sub-zero temperatures, after a drought last summer, have created the worst natural disaster there in 50 years.</p>

        <p>PHILIPPINES: PRESIDENTIAL POWER -- President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo consolidated her hold on power when a coalition of parties that back her wrested control of the House of Representatives from supporters of the deposed leader Joseph Estrada. An Arroyo backer, Feliciano Belmonte, left, was voted in as the new speaker. Mrs. Arroyo also won pledges of support from the United States, receiving a phone call from President Bush offering her assistance ''in any way.''</p>

        <p>IRAN: ASSAD VISITS -- President Bashar al-Assad of Syria was greeted in Tehran by President Mohammad Khatami after arriving on his first visit to Iran, a close regional ally, since taking office last July. Mr. Assad, who has made only a handful of trips abroad since succeeding his late father, Hafez, is also to meet with the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, during his two-day visit.</p>
