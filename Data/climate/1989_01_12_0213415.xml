        <p>When Allan E. Gotlieb arrived here seven years ago as Ambassador from Canada, he labored under some misconceptions. Among them, he recalled, was the impression that there was a single point of power in Washington: the Presidency. He soon learned that a diplomat must also pay a great deal of attention to Congress.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gotlieb, who has just concluded his tenure in Washington, became a practitioner of what he calls ''the new diplomacy,'' which in contrast to traditional diplomacy is conducted in the open; on Capitol Hill, for instance. He describes this brand of diplomacy as unique to Washington.</p>
        <p>''The most important part of diplomacy here is not necessarily conducted behind closed doors,'' he said. ''I've devoted a tremendous amount of my time to the Hill and you work in public there. I've called on senators, on such contentious issues as hogs and cable broadcasting and corn, to find the senators have their own cameras there.'' Power in Washington is shared, Mr. Gotlieb found. ''In other countries the executive proposes and the legislature disposes, but here Congress often proposes as well as disposes,'' he said. ''The chairmen of the principal committees, the Speaker, the whips, they are like ministers. The power they exercise is comparable to executive power because they can initiate and they do initate.'' How Do You Cope?  When Mr. Gotlieb arrived in this country to take up his first ambassadorial post, he and his wife, Sondra, felt almost overwhelmed.</p>
        <p>''All these people, how to cope?'' recalled Mrs. Gotlieb as she and her husband talked recently about their years in Washington. ''I had never had a secretary, never bossed anyone. I asked Allan, 'What am I supposed to do?' and he replied, 'I don't know. I don't even know what I'm supposed to do.' ''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gotlieb, a former academician and Rhodes scholar, and his wife, the author of two novels and two cookbooks, quickly capitivated a number of Washingtonians. Evenings at the Canadian Embassy residence became known for spirited company, good conversation and good food.</p>
        <p>''You have to play a very broad field in Washington,'' said Mr. Gotlieb, including in that field thousands of lobbyists, lawyers, journalists, associations, political action committees and Congressional staff members.</p>
        <p>''Our entertainment style derived from our need to get to know a lot of people across the whole field,'' Mr. Gotlieb said.</p>
        <p>''This is a town in which everyone has to connect,'' his wife interjected, ''so we would entertain.''</p>
        <p>In Washington, Mr. Gotlieb observed, gossip is information. And information is power.</p>
        <p>A principle of classic diplomacy is that a diplomat does not interfere in the internal affairs of the country to which he is accredited. ''But that doesn't work anymore,'' Mr. Gotlieb said. ''Interpendence has changed all that.'' Criticism for Columns</p>
        <p>The Gotliebs consider their Washington years ''the biggest event of our lives outside our marriage,'' Mrs. Gotlieb said. But they also learned what it is like to be under fire in a capital that relentlessly keeps track of who is up and who is down.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Gotlieb was criticized by some of her peers for writing columns for The Washington Post that poked fun at the pretensions and tribal rites of ''Powertown.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gotlieb's ties to the Reagan Administration came under scrutiny when he was subpoenaed to testify at the perjury trial of Michael K. Deaver, a former Reagan aide. Mr. Deaver's lobbying firm was paid $105,000 by the Canadian Government to deal with the issue of acid rain falling on Canada as a result of industrial pollution in the United States. The acid precipitation destroys freshwater life in many lakes.</p>
        <p>The capital also reverberated with gossip and speculation three years ago when Mrs. Gotlieb, in a nervous temper, slapped her social secretary just before an Embassy dinner in honor of Canada's Prime Minister, Brian Mulroney.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Gotlieb plans to write a book about Washington when she and her husband are settled in Cambridge, Mass., where he will be the visiting professor of Canadian studies at Harvard University's Center for International Affairs. Her Advice: 'Be Natural'</p>
        <p>What advice does she have for diplomats? Take a few chances.</p>
        <p>''Americans are very outgoing and have a wonderful sense of humor,'' she said. ''If they see you are natural, they'll be natural. Take a few chances. I've seen too many unhappy diplomats. They are too afraid.'' Mr. Gotlieb takes great satisfaction in the trade agreement that was recently reached between Canada and the United States.</p>
        <p>''I think the free trade agreements will not end disputes between us,'' he said, ''but it will make them easier to resolve in an objective way. Now we have written a set of North American rules for North American trade so that when we deal with rising economic powers of the world we will both, I think, be able to work more closely together and be more effective in world councils.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gotlieb's successor, Derek Burney will face a number of unresolved issues, including acid rain, and perhaps a few Mr. Gotlieb dealt with.</p>
        <p>A proposition of United States politics, Mr. Gotlieb says, is ''it's never over till it's over, and in the U.S. system of government it's never over.''</p>
