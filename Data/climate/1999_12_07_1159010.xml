        <p>In a concession to environmentalists, the Ford Motor Company said today that it would pull out of the Global Climate Coalition, a group of big manufacturers and oil and mining companies that lobbies against restrictions on emissions of gases linked to global warming.</p>
        <p>Ford's decision is the latest sign of divisions within heavy industry over how to respond to global warming.

        <p>In a concession to environmentalists, the Ford Motor Company said today that it would pull out of the Global Climate Coalition, a group of big manufacturers and oil and mining companies that lobbies against restrictions on emissions of gases linked to global warming.</p>
        <p>Ford's decision is the latest sign of divisions within heavy industry over how to respond to global warming. British Petroleum and Shell pulled out of the coalition two years ago following criticisms from environmental groups in Europe, where there has been more public concern than in the United States. Most scientists believe that emissions from automobiles, power plants and other man-made sources are warming the Earth's atmosphere.</p>
        <p>British Petroleum and Shell were so-called general, or junior, members of the lobbying group. Ford is the first company belonging to the board that has withdrawn, and the first American company to leave the coalition, said Frank Maisano, a spokesman for the coalition.</p>
        <p>Ford's chairman since the beginning of this year, William C. Ford Jr., is a great-grandson of Henry Ford and has long been active in environmental causes. He has said that global warming is an international problem that requires action, although he has echoed other industry leaders in opposing the global warming agreement reached two years ago in Kyoto, Japan. That agreement, signed by more than 100 nations, calls for reducing man-made emissions of carbon dioxide and other global warming gases by industrialized countries.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists had questioned whether Mr. Ford's company had shifted its position much, and demanded that Ford leave the coalition. ''Over the course of time,'' said Terry Bresnihan, a spokesman for the auto maker, ''membership in the Global Climate Coalition has become something of an impediment for Ford Motor to credibly achieving our environmental objectives.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bresnihan said Ford remained opposed to the Kyoto agreement because developing nations are largely exempt from its rules. Connie Holmes, the coalition's chairwoman, said that the group opposed the Kyoto agreement and wanted more scientific research into whether global warming was a problem, adding that she did not believe Ford's current position was much different from the coalition's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford's predecessor as chairman, Alexander Trotman, who became a British life peer earlier this year, had been one of corporate America's most outspoken leaders in opposing international pacts on global warming. Lord Trotman and his counterparts from General Motors and Chrysler met with President Clinton in October 1997, and tried to talk him out of seeking an agreement two months later in Kyoto. After meeting the President, Lord Trotman held a news conference outside the White House and denounced the administration's position.</p>
