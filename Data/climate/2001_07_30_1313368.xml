        <p>AS quietly as a robot drifting into sleep mode, the science fiction fantasy ''A.I.: Artificial Intelligence'' recently slipped from the box office top 10, a mere four weeks after its debut.</p>
        <p>The movie's writer and director, Steven Spielberg, and its distributor, Warner Brothers, had probably counted on a better outcome, given Mr. Spielberg's record with such past science fiction hits as ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind'' and, especially, ''E.T.: The Extraterrestrial.'' But the disappointing ticket sales for ''A.I.'' may say something significant about the public's current attitude toward technology.</p>
        <p>Because it was Mr. Spielberg, and because the film was the result of his yearslong collaboration with the late Stanley Kubrick, the movie certainly received ample prerelease publicity. And so the premise is probably familiar even to many of the millions of people who have declined to see it: In a dystopian American future, a disturbingly lifelike robotic boy named David has been programmed to love the human mother who adopts, and then abandons, him.</p>
        <p>(Warning: The next two paragraphs reveal key elements of the movie's plot.)</p>
        <p>These events cause David, taking a page from ''Pinocchio,'' to yearn to become a ''real boy'' so his parent will love him. David's wish is eventually granted -- sort of -- but not for 2,000 years and not until human beings have become extinct. Sympathetic androids from another universe arrange for David to spend one glorious day alone with Mommy, who has been plucked from wherever it is that time folds back on itself and has been brought briefly back to life.</p>
        <p>Because of quantum limitations even Einstein wouldn't have foreseen, the woman can live only till sunset. At that point she dies forever, but only after finally telling David she loves him. Fulfilled, the little lad lies down beside the dead mother and falls asleep to dream, one can only assume, artificially intelligent Oedipal dreams. (The real science fiction in all this may not be a robot boy with such intense emotions, but a battery that would power the little tyke for two millennia without a recharge.)</p>
        <p>The film had generally favorable reviews -- a B+ average from the readers and critics polled by Entertainment Weekly -- and a respectable $30.1 million opening weekend at the end of June. But the movie, three hours long, evidently gathered little word-of-mouth momentum. Ticket sales quickly tapered off.</p>
        <p>Through the weekend of July 22, when ''A.I.'' drew $2.2 million, its total domestic ticket sales were $74.5 million. That is far behind the summer's leader so far, ''Shrek,'' a computer-animated comic fairy tale that has surpassed $250 million in sales. And the ''A.I.'' receipts are likely to end up well back of ''Jurassic Park III,'' the biotech fairy tale that grossed $80.9 million in its first week, according to ACNielsen EDI.</p>
        <p>If ''A.I.'' were a stock, you might say that it had a promising I.P.O. but that the investing public bailed out after taking a close look at its story. In fact, you could argue that ''A.I.,'' a parable for our computer-animated times, is yet another casualty of the wary public's weariness with information technology and tech stocks.</p>
        <p>Movies are not stocks, of course, although with tickets now $10 in many Manhattan theaters, shares of Lucent begin to look like a bargain. But movies and stocks are similar to the extent that they let people place financial bets on something they have read about or heard about or have somehow decided, ''This looks like it might be a winner.''</p>
        <p>And the popularity of technology stocks and of technology movies at any given time tells us something about the public's appetite for the story of the moment.</p>
        <p>In late March 1999, for example, with Internet stocks gathering speed and the Nasdaq composite index nearing 2,500 and approaching escape velocity, Warner Brothers released ''The Matrix.'' That film, a cyber-fantasy action story, starred Keanu Reeves as a computer hacker who discovers that reality as he and his fellow humans know it is being manipulated by sentient computers. Aided by martial arts and special effects, the hacker-hero saves the world.</p>
        <p>''The Matrix,'' an apt metaphor for Web-conquering dot-com entrepreneurs wearing black business casual, was one of 1999's big hits, grossing more than $171 million.</p>
        <p>It may be that ''A.I.'' is every bit as much a film for its moment. And that may be part of its problem.</p>
        <p>The movie has arrived in the wake of the tech-stock meltdown. (The metaphor in the film is global warming, which has caused the polar ice caps to melt and flood the world's coastal regions, including New York, and presumably much of Silicon Valley.)</p>
        <p>In the summer of 2001, with the Nasdaq cresting at 2,000 on a good day, the public may understandably resent visionary technology entrepreneurs of the type played in the movie by William Hurt. Mr. Hurt's character, the allegorically named Allen Hobby, has developed the robotic David and plans to market an entire product line of children just like him, all programmed to love. (And some of you thought Windows XP was the big threat.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Hobby, to be sure, is meant to be seen as misguided. But his lack of humanity is not unique among the people in ''A.I.,'' a movie in which there are no redeeming human beings and in which -- in breaking the techno-movie formula -- no human hero emerges to wrestle the computers to the mat. In the end, there is simply that contented little robo-boy, drifting into sleep mode, as Mom lies moldering at his side.</p>
        <p>Audiences may have expected something more upbeat from Mr. Spielberg and even from the darker-toned Mr. Kubrick -- who, after all, directed ''2001: A Space Odyssey.'' In that film, HAL the computer begins to run amok, but he is vanquished when a human pulls his plug. By the end of ''A.I.,'' though, there is no person left even to switch off the lights.</p>
        <p>Somehow, in collaborating on this futuristic fairy tale, Mr. Spielberg and the late Mr. Kubrick morphed into the brothers grim. Theirs may be a fitting story for anyone who has seen his 401(k) portfolio wiped out by the crash of tech stocks. But it isn't the story many people feel like paying to watch right now.</p>
