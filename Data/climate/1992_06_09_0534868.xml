        <p>The Bush Administration's drive for a sweeping statement of principles on conserving the world's forests at the Earth Summit was stymied today because of objections by poor countries resisting such an agreement as an intrusion on their autonomy.</p>
        <p>An agreement on the forestry initiative, which has picked up support among industrial nations over the last 18 months, has become President Bush's highest priority. The White House renewed its backing this week as a way of demonstrating American leadership on environmental issues and deflecting criticism of other American environmental policies.</p>
        <p>As an incentive to developing countries, Mr. Bush said the United States would increase its aid to other nations' forestry programs by $150 million, to $270 million, in the next fiscal year. He challenged other nations to double spending on forest conservation, to $2.7 billion annually. Japan to Increase Aid</p>
        <p>But diplomats and environmental groups said the Administration's proposed spending was giving little impetus to the forestry talks.</p>
        <p>In a day of negotiations on several issues as the Earth Summit churned through its sixth day there were these other developments:</p>
        <p>*Japan indicated that it would substantially increase its foreign aid, which has been running at about $10 billion a year, to help poor countries pay for environmental programs.</p>
        <p>*There was an 11th-hour attempt by Britain, France and Japan to persuade the Bush Administration to sign a treaty to protect plants, animals and natural resources.</p>
        <p>*Germany took the lead in Europe in pressing for a protocol to a treaty at Rio to adopt stricter limits on carbon dioxide emissions, the heat-trapping gases believed to cause global warming, than those supported by the United States. Conflict Over Forests</p>
        <p>The goal of persuading the Rio summit conference to call for a treaty on preserving the world's forests, or at least issue a declaration of principles, has won broad support from the United States and other industrial countries. But developing countries are resisting an accord as an unwarranted intervention in their domestic matters.</p>
        <p>As a fallback, the United States has proposed a simple call by the Earth Summit for future negotiations on a forest treaty, but even this weaker step "is not in the cards," said Gareth Porter of the Environmental and Energy Study Institute in Washington, an independent research organization.</p>
        <p>"There is no way you're going to change the developing countries' mind on this anytime in the foreseeable future," said Mr. Porter, an official observer at the conference.</p>
        <p>Underscoring Mr. Porter's pessimistic assessment, Kamal Nath, India's Environment Minister, said at a news conference that "we have opposed and will continue to oppose" such a treaty.</p>
        <p>Forests, he said, are not a global issue any more than oil is, in effect rejecting the industrialized countries' argument that forests are an essential part of the global biosphere.</p>
        <p>A United States official said that while Washington still hoped that a treaty could eventually be negotiated, it recognized that the developing countries were "so nervous about this" that Washington was hoping simply for "a good declaration of forest principles." Agreement Is Doubted</p>
        <p>But some delegates said that even a nonbinding statement of forest principles, the minimum that had been expected to come out of Rio on the subject, might not be produced. "Unless there's a real change of attitude, we're not going to have a statement," said a European delegate who spoke on the condition that he not be identified.</p>
        <p>This delegate said that negotiators might simply submit to the main session of the Rio summit meeting "some sort of statement that we were working hard but could not agree." Asked if this could be the conference's first clear-cut failure, he answered, "Yes."</p>
        <p>Both delegates and observers said that time was rapidly running out. Negotiations must be completed by Wednesday night, and the European delegate said that while there had been some progress, the two major questions of the call for a treaty and trade in forest products had not yet even been addressed.</p>
        <p>The negotiators, he said, had already declared an impasse on another major issue: Whether to call for international guidelines for the management of forests, a point favored by the industrialized countries but rejected by the developing nations.</p>
        <p>As for the $150 million in aid for forest preservation proposed by Mr. Bush, this official said that some developing countries had expressed interest in receiving the money. An American official said that those countries that supported the United States in pushing for a full declaration of principles on forests at the Rio conference would receive special consideration in the distribution of the American aid. 'It's a Toughie'</p>
        <p>While there was some movement on these steps, Maurice Strong, secretary general of the summit meeting, was less than optimistic about the outcome. "It's a toughie," he said.</p>
        <p>Compounding the impasse, environmentalists charged that the forest talks were being used as a political football to gain leverage in negotiations on a comprehensive blueprint to guide nations in pursuing economic development while protecting the environment. As a result, they said, proposals were being watered down to the point of worthlessness.</p>
        <p>"They're in real serious trouble," William Mankin of the Sierra Club, a forest specialist, said of the talks. And if they succeed in producing a statement of principles, he said, "they're just not going to do anything wonderful."</p>
        <p>He and other environmentalists charge that even if there is agreement on a draft statement on forests, it will probably fall far short of forestry measures already taken. Among such measures are the World Bank's prohibition adopted in 1991 on financing for logging in primary tropical rain forests, and other international rules confining trade in tropical timber to materials gained from sustainable forest management.</p>
        <p>The environmentalits also said that the proposed forestry statement being discussed in Rio would not adequately address the root causes of forest destruction, like clearing land for agriculture and cutting trees for fuel and timber sales. Reserving Veto Power</p>
        <p>On the biodiversity treaty, some European Governments, including the British, were said to be preparing to sign the treaty while formally declaring at the same time that they would reserve the right of veto power over provisions on control of financing.</p>
        <p>The United States opposes the treaty because it fears that there might be provisions making the financing of preservation projects mandatory.</p>
        <p>The Bush Administration also opposes the treaty on grounds that it does not do enough to protect intellectual property rights relating to the manufacturing and marketing of medicines and other materials gleaned from the world's forests.</p>
        <p>Some of those involved in the last-minute attempt to obtain American support say that the United States might be able to sign the treaty conditionally. Under this proposal, the United States would sign but would also issue a statement saying that it was interpreting the treaty in its own way. American opposition to the treaty has drawn widespread criticism, but many delegates were doubtful that the United States would go along.</p>
        <p>"I can't believe they will get Bush to sign," said a member of the American delegation, who added that there was "a lot of scurrying around looking for something for Bush to announce."  Carbon Monoxide Targets</p>
        <p>Europeans, led by Germany, made it clear that they would accompany their signing of the climate treaty with a declaration advocating firm targets and timetables for reducing their emissions of carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>One way to do this would be to negotiate a protocol to the treaty after it is ratified. It would embody the European proposal, rejected by the United States in the treaty itself, to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels in the year 2000. The United States position is that it is too soon to consider such protocols, giving the uncertain state of scientific knowledge about global warming. The Europeans say the science is convincing to them.</p>
        <p>"We continue to think that setting targets and timetables is setting the cart before the horse," Michael Young, an American spokesman, said at a news conference today.</p>
        <p>Whatever the outcome of the talks here, negotiators tonight created a new international watchdog group, the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development, to insure that governments respect the pledges they make here.</p>
