        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Troubled Oil, or Troubled Waters?'' (editorial, May 8) raises some good points regarding our national energy needs and the offshore oil dilemma. However, it is important to point out that oil on the face of the earth runs out in about 100 years. If we do not begin to wean ourselves from oil, we will not only continue the fossil-fuel pollution crisis, smog and the greenhouse effect, we will be bestowing on our grandchildren a chaotic economy frantically attempting to institute conservation and renewable fuel programs.</p>
        <p>Coastal oil development is not the answer to this dilemma.</p>
        <p>The idea that we should pursue coastal oil development as an essential aspect of our national energy policy is part of the illusion that we can endlessly spend our and the world's finite resources with impunity. We cannot. Nor can we afford to suffer the environmental degradation of an oil spill like the Santa Barbara well blowout of 1969 or tanker accidents like the Exxon Valdez.</p>
        <p>Oil is a potent toxin. At 100 parts per million, oil is classified as hazardous waste. Oil at 5 parts per billion impairs the ability of fish to hunt by affecting their sense of smell. Oil at 1 microgram per liter kills fish and shellfish larvae. Oil destroys both the phytoplankton and the zooplankton, the source of both the food chain and most of the world's oxygen. And as witnessed so tragically with the Exxon Valdez spill, oil killed sea mammals and sea birds in large numbers through hypothermia, poisoning and respiratory disease.</p>
        <p>Oil passes into the food chain. Studies show that 13 years after an oil spill, oil at 100 parts per million can still be measured in sediments and being released from sediments.</p>
        <p>Offshore oil drilling causes severe air pollution. One exploratory drill ship produces the smog equivalent of 7,000 cars driven 50 miles per day. As shown in both the Valdez spill and the recent Huntington Beach, Calif., spill, coastal tourism and commercial fishing suffer irreparable harm.</p>
        <p>It is important to place the offshore oil energy debate in a proper context. We can have energy and a healthy unpolluted environment: they are not mutually exclusive.</p>
        <p>Sixty-three percent of our oil needs go toward transportation. In the United States, we are now at the 1985 standard of 27.5 fleet miles per gallon for automobiles. Modern technology, however, can produce cars capable of achieving 107 miles per gallon; and there are cars on today's market that achieve 58 miles per gallon.</p>
        <p>If we raised fleet miles per gallon to 40 by the year 2000, we could save four times all of the oil that exists off both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the United States. Indeed, if we were to institute a winterization program for the United States, we could save more than two times the oil that exists off both our coastlines. We don't have to settle for a future of disastrous oil spills that ruin our marine environment.</p>
