        <p>Rejecting a last-ditch effort by the Bush Administration to keep the $5.5 billion Shoreham Nuclear Power Station alive, a Federal appeals court ruled yesterday that the plant's owner could begin dismantling it without conducting an environmental impact study.</p>
        <p>The decision, by the United States Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia circuit, grants Shoreham's owner a new license that allows it to begin taking apart the fully operational, 809-megawatt plant. The owner, the Long Island Lighting Company, said that it would quickly move forward to decommission the plant, making the chance that it will ever operate as a nuclear plant decidedly remote.</p>
        <p>The decision is a major blow to the Department of Energy, which has portrayed Shoreham's operation as an important symbol of its commitment to nuclear energy. Earlier this month, the Justice Department, acting for the Energy Department, argued that the environmental consequences of other power sources, like fossil fuels, should be studied before the plant was abandoned.  No Environmental Study Needed</p>
        <p>Yesterday's ruling rejected that argument and let stand a decision by the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission saying that no environmental study was needed before the new license, known as a "possession only" license, could be granted. The new license took effect at 12:01 this morning.</p>
        <p>The plant's supporters said they would continue fighting the nuclear commission's decision and appealed yesterday evening to the United States Supreme Court for an emergency stay.</p>
        <p>But with the new license in effect, Shoreham is be on an almost irrevocable path to destruction, officials say. Trying to run it now would take two to three years and cost $300 million, they say, and the time and cost will multiply once the process of dismantling begins.</p>
        <p>Richard M. Kessel, chairman of the Long Island Power Authority, the state agency formed to take over and take apart the plant, said decommissioning could begin as early as October and would take about two years and cost about $186 million.</p>
        <p>Joanne Johnson, a spokeswoman for the Energy Department, said she would have no comment on yesterday's ruling. In January, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins called the decision not to operate the plant "tragic" and warned that it would have "adverse consequences on energy security and reliability, the environment, the ratepayers of Long Island and the New York State economy."</p>
        <p>But New York State, which is waiting for approval from the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission to take over and dismantle Shoreham, applauded the ruling and said it was a warning to the Federal Government not to meddle in local decisions about nuclear energy.</p>
        <p>"I would hope that the Bush Administration would now cease its efforts to try and delay the decommissioning of Shoreham," said Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in a prepared statement.</p>
        <p>In 1989, after intense pressure from Mr. Cuomo and officials in Suffolk County, who argued that Long Island could not be safely evacuated in the event of a nuclear disaster, the lighting company agreed to turn the plant over to the state for $1 in return for 10 years of rate increases.</p>
        <p>Conceived in 1966, completed in 1984, and granted a full-power operating license in 1989, the Shoreham Nuclear Power Station was originally billed as an answer to Long Island's energy problems. The plant, able to provide 809 megawatts of power, or enough electricity for about one-third of the Island's 903,000 homes, was seen by proponents of nuclear power as a clean and safe alternative to the messy, aging fossil fuel plants on the Island.  Never Allowed to Operate</p>
        <p>Though the plant, on a rural road in a remote village on the north shore of Suffolk County, performed successfully in low-power tests in 1985 and 1987, it was never allowed to operate. Originally budgeted at $269 million, it ended up costing $5.5 billion.</p>
        <p>In June 1989, after years of bitter debates and court battles on both sides, Lilco signed its agreement with New York State, which vowed to take over and then take apart the plant.</p>
        <p>But transferring and dismantling a power plant is hardly simple. Every modification, from the most trivial to the most-far reaching, has to be reviewed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</p>
        <p>As a result, though the nuclear fuel has been removed from the reactor and is being stored in a spent-fuel pool inside the plant, Shoreham has been sitting in a more-or-less pristine condition for the last two years.  2 Groups Fight for Plant</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, a case for Shoreham was made in the courts and before the nuclear commission by the plant's supporters, most particularly the Shoreham-Wading River Central School District, which depends on the taxes the plant generates, and a group called Scientists and Engineers for Secure Energy, Inc.</p>
        <p>Last month, when the nuclear commission said that it planned to grant a possession-only license to Lilco, the two groups asked the United States Court of Appeals to stay that decision. The Department of Defense, represented by the Department of Justice, joined in that request, and it was that motion that was rejected yesterday. The school district and the scientists' group made the final appeal to the Supreme Court last night.</p>
        <p>Under its full-power license, Lilco was required to maintain Shoreham almost as if it were an operating plant. Many employees had to spend as much as one in six working shifts in training sessions and many of the operating systems had to be kept up.</p>
        <p>Joseph W. McDonnell, a Lilco spokesman, said Shoreham's cost under the full-power license was $400,000 a day, with about half going to taxes and half to maintain the plant. Under the new license, he said, Lilco will immediately begin saving $48,000 a day.  Lilco Can Shift 100 Workers</p>
        <p>The new license relieves Lilco of many of its previous requirements. Mr. McDonnell said it would enable the lighting company to shift 100 Shoreham workers to new jobs, either in helping to decommission the plant or in other parts of the company. It will also allow Lilco to vacate many parts of the plant it had been required to maintain, though it will still follow strict safety requirements for the spent fuel and the contaminated areas. Those will be dismantled and disposed of when decommissioning begins.</p>
        <p>Now that it has agreed to the possession-only license, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is free to consider the next two issues before it: Lilco's request to transfer Shoreham to the Long Island Power Authority, a state agency, for $1, and the power authority's request to decommission it.</p>
        <p>It is unclear what will happen to Shoreham then. A business group on Long Island has proposed using the property as a terminal for a new ferry across Long Island Sound. The Long Island Power Authority has said it would be feasible to convert the plant to a 413-megawatt natural gas-fired plant, but that would require a developer with $215 million.</p>
