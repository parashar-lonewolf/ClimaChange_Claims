        <p>The inhalation of tiny smoke particles from wildfires, while unpleasant, is unlikely to cause long-term damage to healthy people unless it occurs over a prolonged period, doctors and environmental health specialists said.</p>
        <p>But the experts also warned that young children, the elderly and anyone with chronic pulmonary or cardiovascular conditions could be at risk for complications, and those people were particularly advised to stay indoors and run their air-conditioners while the fires in Southern California continued to rage.</p>
        <p>Joe Tash, a spokesman at San Diego County's emergency operations center, said hospitals in the area had reported a significant rise in the number of people seeking treatment for respiratory problems, particularly among those with pre-existing lung-related ailments. Most patients have been treated and released rather than hospitalized, he said.</p>
        <p>At the University of California at San Diego Medical Center, a spokeswoman reported that earlier in the week the number of people visiting the emergency room for respiratory complaints had increased by 50 percent. A hospital-affiliated clinic down the street, she added, was seeing twice the usual number of patients with respiratory problems.</p>
        <p>The primary danger, experts say, arises from particles from vegetation and other burned matter that can lodge deep in the lungs and, in some cases, lead to severe shortness of breath, asthma attacks, bronchitis and other pulmonary ailments.</p>
        <p>The most damaging particles are invisible to the eye and can evade the body's normal protective mechanisms, like tiny hairs in the nostrils and cells within the lungs designed to expel or destroy alien substances.</p>
        <p>''If you can see the particles, they're not going to hurt you, unless they land in your eye,'' said Dr. William Hughson, a professor of medicine at the University of California at San Diego and director of its Center for Occupational and Environmental Medicine. The particles to be concerned about, Dr. Hughson said, are smaller than three microns in size, or three-thousandths of a millimeter.</p>
        <p>''These particles can irritate your nose, your sinuses, your lungs,'' he said. ''If you're healthy and normal, those effects will go away after the air pollution clears out.''</p>
        <p>Dick Smith, director of air pollution control for San Diego County, said all residents were being advised to stay indoors as much as possible, to curtail exercise and other activities that caused them to gulp in air and to drink plenty of fluids. Facial masks can help, he said, especially if they filter out tiny particles and fit tightly over the mouth and nose.</p>
        <p>Inhaled particles inflame the bronchial tubes and can cause them to constrict, a process that can be dangerous for anyone with asthma or other respiratory ailments, Mr. Smith said. They can also impede the function of the the tiny airways deep in the lungs where incoming oxygen is delivered to the blood.</p>
        <p>''The particles can disrupt the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen, which then causes people to be short of breath, among other things,'' Mr. Smith said.</p>
        <p>Scientists say it can be hard to study the effects of forest fire smoke because such research depends on events in the natural world. Still, a few studies have borne out a relationship between forest fires and a rise in people seeking medical help.</p>
        <p>In forest fires, smoke particles are mainly made up of organic material from burning vegetation. That distinguishes them from the kinds of particles found in urban fires, like those associated with the attack on the World Trade Center two years ago.</p>
        <p>''When buildings burn down, you can get some nasty things,'' Dr. Hughson said. ''An awful lot of the dust that came down with the towers was construction materials, a lot of concrete dust. That's very, very irritating, more toxic than this stuff from a forest fire.''</p>
