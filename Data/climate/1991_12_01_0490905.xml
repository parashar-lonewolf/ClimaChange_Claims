        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In "Cars Are America's Main Form of Mass Transit" (letter, Nov. 5), John A. Bradley makes the questionable claim that "we enjoy the most advanced mass-transit system in the world -- the private automobile," and chides Congress for focusing on other means of mass transit, such as passenger rail service.</p>
        <p>While the private automobile is undoubtedly convenient, its use as an element of mass transit is hardly the most advanced method. Compared with passenger rail and bus service, the private automobile is the least efficient in land use (for parking lots and multilane highways), time (a commuter's attention while driving must be directed toward the road, whereas it may be directed toward work while commuting by public transportation) and the consumption of nonrenewable resources such as fossil fuels. Also compared with bus and train service, the private automobile is the most polluting and by far the most dangerous.</p>
        <p>Only in personal convenience can the private automobile be considered most advanced -- and that personal convenience is being taxed ever more painfully, as more and more Americans are forced to drive their automobiles on facilities whose expansion is increasingly difficult.</p>
        <p>Further, if public money is to be spent to improve the availability and performance of mass transit, the very term "private automobile" suggests the inherent contradiction of spending public dollars for private privilege. Mass transit organized around the private automobile is exclusive in nature: only those who can afford an automobile, its maintenance and the high cost of insurance can enjoy its benefits, with the result that those with the most dire need for mass transit (lower-income Americans unable to afford an automobile) are effectively denied access to it.</p>
        <p>Such regressive spending policies have been a trademark of recent Republican administrations, which would finance such programs as the space plane (a suborbital stretch limousine affordable only to those in the highest income brackets), and eliminate funds altogether for Amtrak (which ordinary Americans</p>
        <p>are</p>
        <p>riding today, in ever-increasing numbers). JAMES C. VLCEK  St. Paul, Nov. 16, 1991</p>
