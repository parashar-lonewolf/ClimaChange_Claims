        <p>LEAD: A CENTURY and a half after the French physicist Edmund Becquerel discovered that light can be transformed directly into electrical energy, the photovoltaic exploitation of sunlight seems finally on the verge of broad commercial use.</p>
        <p>A CENTURY and a half after the French physicist Edmund Becquerel discovered that light can be transformed directly into electrical energy, the photovoltaic exploitation of sunlight seems finally on the verge of broad commercial use.</p>
        <p>So far, solar electric cells have largely been sold for specialized purposes where cost was less important, as in spacecraft and to power isolated communications networks, navigation aids, recreational vehicles and homes remote from power lines. Now, because of technological advances, reduced manufacturing costs and other factors, a few solar plants are being built to sell electricity to utilities.</p>
        <p>And within a decade or two, experts say, solar plants could make a significant contribution to the nation's electricity supply, especially in periods of peak demand when excessive loads on conventional generating capacity can cause ''brown-outs'' or even blackouts.</p>
        <p>Significant progress with solar cells would help speed the transition from fossil fuels that experts say is needed to combat the greenhouse effect, climate changes induced by the rise in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Solar Energy's '4-Minute Mile'</p>
        <p>A major technological advance earlier this year has transformed thinking about the ultimate prospects for solar electricity. A research program sponsored by the Department of Energy reached a milestone that experts had compared with the running of a mile in less than four minutes, a goal that was regarded as impossible until it was achieved. Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M., built an experimental device called a ''mechanically-stacked multijunction solar cell'' that converts a phenomenal 31 percent of the light striking it into electricity. Previously, many experts had considered 30-percent efficiency unattainable for a photovoltaic cell. (By comparison, the solar cells in pocket calculators have an efficiency of less than 3 percent.) Scientists at Sandia believe that, with the device's capacity to use cells in tandem, efficiencies of up to 35 percent will be achieved in the next few years. For the first time, therefore, the conversion of solar energy to electrical power could become comparable in efficiency to conventional power generation; coal-fired and oil-fired electric plants have an average efficiency of 34 percent.</p>
        <p>High efficiency is vital to making economical use of light from the sun, because an inefficient cell costs just as much as an efficient one to install in the necessary supporting machinery.</p>
        <p>Even before the technological breakthrough, which will not find its way into commercial plants for several years, the cost of manufacturing and operating efficient photovoltaic cells had recently begun to fall. The trend was dramatically underscored last week with an announcement by the Chronar Corporation of Princeton, N.J., that it intends to build a 50-megawatt photovoltaic electricity plant near Los Angeles. The plant, which will use an older technology to supply power to the Southern California Edison Company, will not be the first of its kind for the region. But it will have a capacity seven times as great as the next largest solar plant.</p>
        <p>The plant will have a conversion efficiency of only about 6 percent, but in the next few years plants are likely to be more than twice as efficient. Further down the line, the new tandem cells and other new technologies could bring efficiencies to 38 percent.</p>
        <p>Production costs could be substantially reduced with a new generation of ''thin-film'' photovoltaic cells produced in endless sheets, in somewhat the way photographic film is manufactured. Incentives and Obstacles</p>
        <p>Solar energy enthusiasts have long dreamed of replacing fossil fuels and nuclear power, plagued by environmental and political concerns, with energy extracted from sunlight. The development of solar power has been sporadically accelerated in the past three decades by oil shortages, which led to Government subsidies for solar development, and by the need for virtually inexhaustible power supplies aboard space vehicles, which spurred technological innovation.</p>
        <p>But formidable obstacles have snagged progress. Falling oil prices in the mid-1980's reduced the incentive to develop alternatives to fossil fuels. At the same time, the United States Government reduced its support of the leading photovoltaic program from a peak of $150 million a year in the last oil shortage in 1981 to the present level of $35 million. Basic research in general has failed to realize the optimistic forecasts made in the 1970's for solar energy.</p>
        <p>Another problem is that the efficient exploitation of solar power requires lots of space and abundant sunlight. A typical solar electricity plant that now supplies 1 million watts of power per hour to the Southern California Edison commercial grid sprawls over 20 acres of land near Hesperia, Calif., east of Los Angeles. A coal-fired plant producing 10 times as much power would probably occupy only one-tenth the space - although it uses more space elsewhere in mining and transportation.</p>
        <p>But improved understanding of the physics of materials and new engineering techniques seem to herald a new period of rapid progress. Dr. Dan E. Arvizu, director of the photovoltaics program at Sandia, believes that despite the disappointments of the past decade, the recent progress indicates that solar photovoltaic energy may provide as much as 1 percent of America's electricity in the early years of the 21st century.</p>
        <p>''That may not sound like much, but it would be an enormous amount of power available during times of peak consumption,'' he said. The present United States power generating capacity is about 600 billion watts. One percent of this would be 6 billion watts, which would supply the needs of more than 3 million people. When the cost of solar power is brought down to about 12 cents per kilowatt-hour, Dr. Arvizu said, solar power will become attractive for use in peak periods, and this goal is in sight. How the Cells Work</p>
        <p>Although many systems for exploiting solar energy have been devised, experts think that photovoltaic cells offer the best prospect of efficient commercial electricity generation.</p>
        <p>Such cells contain crystalline material, in which each atom is linked to neighboring atoms in a rigid lattice structure. The links serving as bonds in the structure are electrons. When light passes through a photovoltaic material, some of the photons in the light strike electron bonds between atoms, and knock the electrons loose.</p>
        <p>Once freed from its lattice, a negatively charged electron begins to wander through the photovoltaic material. The empty, positively charged space it leaves behind in the crystalline lattice is called a ''hole,'' and since a neighboring electron is likely to jump into a fresh hole and thereby leave another hole, holes, in common with loose electrons, are said to ''wander.''</p>
        <p>The trick in making a photovoltaic cell is to continuously sweep the loose, wandering electrons out of the cell as fast as they are produced, and use them as electric power before they have time to affix to wandering holes. If this happens, the solar energy that was imparted to the electron in knocking it loose is lost as heat.</p>
        <p>One way to draw off the electrons is to introduce a few foreign atoms (typically, boron and phosphorus) into the lattice in such a way as to create a permanent positively charged and negatively charged regions within the material, separated by a thin zone known as a ''junction.'' The resulting electrical field across the junction forces wandering, negatively charged electrons to migrate to one region, and positively charged holes to the other. An external electrical connection between these regions allows the electrons to flow as current, which can be used to light lamps, drive motors and so forth.</p>
        <p>Early photovoltaic devices, used in light meters and ''electric eyes,'' were generally based on a metal-like element called selenium. But in 1954, Bell Laboratories discovered a way to use silicon crystals as photovoltaic power sources, and most photovoltaic cells developed since then have incorporated silicon. Two Cells in One</p>
        <p>Part of the new Sandia mechanically stacked multijunction cell is made of silicon, but another part is made of a different photovoltaic material, gallium arsenide. The cell, called a tandem device, is actually two cells in one, manufactured separately and glued together with a transparent adhesive.</p>
        <p>The top cell, produced for Sandia by Varian Associates Inc., Palo Alto, Calif., consists mainly of gallium arsenide, and it absorbs sunlight from the blue end of the spectrum to make electricity. The upper cell is nearly transparent to other wavelengths of light that pass through it to the lower cell. To make the gallium arsenide cell as transparent as possible, the necessary metal connections on its top and bottom are formed of ultra-thin wires arrayed in spider-web patterns.</p>
        <p>The lower cell, made for Sandia by Stanford University and consisting mostly of silicon, generates power using the residual reddish light that passes through the upper cell.</p>
        <p>A complex system of microscopic interconnections links the upper gallium arsenide part with the lower silicon part, so that their electrical output could be combined smoothly.</p>
        <p>Dr. Arvizu said in an interview that in principle, many different cells might be stacked, each one extracting energy from a narrow band of wavelengths of sunlight. For the most efficient conversion of sunlight, however, three layers is likely to be the practical limit.</p>
        <p>To reduce the cost of generating power with expensive high-efficiency cells, sunlight must be concentrated rather than allowed to fall directly on the cell. ''It's much cheaper to make lenses than semiconducting material,'' Dr. Arvizu said, ''so we like to use a large lens focusing light 500 times as strong as ordinary sunlight on a small cell.'' Progress on Thin-Film Cells</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, important progress has been reported in the development of efficient thin-film photovoltaic cells, which do not require lenses and which are much cheaper to make than layered crystalline silicon or gallium arsenide devices.</p>
        <p>Thin-film cells based on non-crystalline (glassy) silicon are produced in great numbers (mostly by Japan) to power pocket calculators and similar devices. Although very cheap, these cells offer efficiencies of less than 3 percent and wear out rapidly. An advantage of such cells is that they continue to produce power in limited amounts even when the sun is not directly focused on them or on cloudy days. By contrast, high-efficiency cells of the type Sandia is developing, work properly only in bright sunlight and they must be oriented to face the sun directly.</p>
        <p>One of the latest thin-film cells, said to have reached efficiencies up to 14 percent, does not degrade in long use. It is based on a substance called copper indium diselenide, or C.I.S., which the Boeing Aerospace Company showed in 1981 could be made into very efficient thin-film cells.</p>
        <p>The main commercial developer of these cells is Arco Solar Inc. of Chatsworth, Calif., a division of Atlantic Richfield Corporation. In the photovoltaic cell developed by Arco Solar, a thin layer of copper indium diselenide is the electrically positive part, and layers of cadmium sulfide and zinc oxide make up the negative part. The combined thickness of all the active layers in this cell is less than 1/ 30th the thickness of a human hair.</p>
        <p>When light shines on the cell, electrons are forced into any external circuit connected to it, creating a current. Arco Solar's manufacturing innovations, recently hailed by the Electric Power Research Institute as revolutionary, have made the production of such cells profitable.</p>
        <p>According to Arco Solar's senior vice president, Dr. Charles F. Gay, the company is making ''table-sized'' C.I.S. cells by depositing five very thin layers of material on a backing of glass. Eventually, however, the company hopes to produce cell material continuously on a flexible plastic backing that can be wound from one spool to another.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gay said worldwide sales of photovoltaic cells amount to about $100 million a year, of which 25 percent to 35 percent go to Arco Solar.</p>
        <p>''The business is big enough to support further research and development,'' he said, ''and as the price of photovoltaic cells comes down, new markets are emerging. The next big plateau is to start replacing diesel-electric generators in isolated places like Hawaii with solar generators. Many different kinds of power will have to be developed in the future, but it looks as if solar photovoltaics will have an assured role.''</p>
