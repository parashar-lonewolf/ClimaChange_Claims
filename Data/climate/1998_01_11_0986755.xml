        <p>Editorial on announcement by three US automakers that they are nearing production of marketable cars that will rely less on gas-burning engines and more on exotic power sources such as fuel cells</p>

        <p>For anyone worried about global warming, last week's most heartening news came from an unlikely source -- the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. All three auto makers announced that they were nearing production of marketable cars that will rely less on gas-burning engines and more on exotic power sources like fuel cells. Because conventional engines account for one-third of America's output of carbon dioxide, the main global warming gas, this was a revelation of potentially enormous significance.</p>
        <p>It was also, in a way, amusing, or so it must have seemed to President Clinton. Mr. Clinton has placed a heavy bet on the proposition that American technological know-how can counter the global warming threat at relatively low cost. For this he has been soundly bashed by the auto makers, the producers of coal and oil and other industries that spent millions of dollars last year belittling the threat of global warming and warning that any serious effort to fight it, like the treaty Mr. Clinton agreed to in Kyoto, Japan, would bankrupt the American economy. Yet here were some of the President's fiercest critics tripping over one another to tout their ''green'' cars and, in the process, suggesting that Mr. Clinton's faith in technology may not be misplaced.</p>

        <p>For anyone worried about global warming, last week's most heartening news came from an unlikely source -- the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. All three auto makers announced that they were nearing production of marketable cars that will rely less on gas-burning engines and more on exotic power sources like fuel cells. Because conventional engines account for one-third of America's output of carbon dioxide, the main global warming gas, this was a revelation of potentially enormous significance.</p>
        <p>It was also, in a way, amusing, or so it must have seemed to President Clinton. Mr. Clinton has placed a heavy bet on the proposition that American technological know-how can counter the global warming threat at relatively low cost. For this he has been soundly bashed by the auto makers, the producers of coal and oil and other industries that spent millions of dollars last year belittling the threat of global warming and warning that any serious effort to fight it, like the treaty Mr. Clinton agreed to in Kyoto, Japan, would bankrupt the American economy. Yet here were some of the President's fiercest critics tripping over one another to tout their ''green'' cars and, in the process, suggesting that Mr. Clinton's faith in technology may not be misplaced.</p>
        <p>Al Gore could also be forgiven a smile. In his 1992 book, ''Earth in the Balance,'' the Vice President called for ''eliminating'' the internal combustion engine in the next 25 years -- a comment  that reinforced his reputation in some circles as a dangerous thinker. Yet right there at the auto  show, the chairman of the General Motors Corporation, John Smith, stated flatly that ''no car company will be able to thrive in the 21st century if it relies solely on internal combustion engines.'' To Detroit-watchers, this seemed an epiphany.</p>
        <p>To anyone who has followed the big environmental struggles of the past quarter-century, Detroit's change of tune fit neatly into a familiar historical pattern. There has always been a big gap between industrial leaders who say they cannot do something and their engineers, who usually figure out a way to do it. Before Congress passed the 1970 Clean Air Act, Detroit argued that significant pollution reductions would be utterly impractical or prohibitively expensive. Then along came the catalytic converter that, at modest cost, eventually cut harmful tailpipe emissions by 95 percent. Likewise, the oil companies predicted economic doom when Congress mandated cleaner fuels in 1990. Their chemists, however, have since managed to produce such fuels without disturbing profits.</p>
        <p>As the record suggests, American industry is not known for spontaneous acts of environmental virtue. But it will respond to timely regulation and commercial realities. One such reality is that Japan is moving quickly to develop low-emission cars. The Japanese caught Detroit flat-footed with their small cars during the oil-price shocks in the 1970's, and Detroit clearly does not wish to be left behind again. In this case, the Federal Government has become an active partner rather than a regulatory adversary. Many of the latest innovations have emerged from the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles, into which Washington has poured nearly $400 million over the last four years.</p>
        <p>One question now is whether the auto makers will continue to oppose the Kyoto treaty. The comment by G.M.'s Mr. Smith suggests that Detroit is beginning to see itself as a critical part of the eventual solution to global warming. If true, that would be the most hopeful news of all from the automobile show.</p>
