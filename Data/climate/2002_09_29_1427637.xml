        <p>NOT so long ago, Bill Clinton and Helmut Kohl, then the chancellor of Germany, shared carpaccio, crab-stuffed mushrooms, sauteed squid and cured meats and cheeses in a run of friendly monster-meals on two continents. The next time Chancellor Gerhard Schröder comes to the White House, he may be lucky to get bread and water from President Bush.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schröder's narrow re-election -- after a campaign marked by its sharp criticism of American policy and Mr. Bush himself -- has left a bad taste on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
        <p>Last week, the president did not muster even a ritual congratulatory phone call to the leader of one of Washington's warmest NATO allies. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, at a NATO meeting in Warsaw, pointedly declined to meet with his German counterpart, Peter Struck, though he did deign to shake his hand.</p>
        <p>''It's not for me to give advice to other countries,'' Mr. Rumsfeld told reporters, before chiding the Germans once more with some pithy American advice. ''If you're in a hole, stop digging,'' he said, smiling, then added: ''I'm not sure I should have said that.''</p>
        <p>Cooler analysts have noted that by opposing Mr. Bush's Iraq policy, Mr. Schröder was giving the administration a taste of its own my-way-or-the-highway medicine on Europe's concerns, from global warming to the International Criminal Court. Already, the Germans are trying to make amends.</p>
        <p>It has renewed its offer, with the Netherlands, to take over peacekeeping duties in Afghanistan at year's end. And German police officials came here to swap information with Americans about Ramzi bin al-Shibh, a top Qaeda suspect thought to have knowledge of the Hamburg cell that spawned the Sept. 11 hijackers. Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer telephoned Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and has said he hopes to be in Washington soon.</p>
        <p>That may be the best news for repairing German-American relations, since Mr. Fischer and Mr. Powell have experience in conflict resolution. In the early 80's, when General Powell was commander of the Army's V Corps in Frankfurt, Mr. Fischer was the leader of the local Greens Party.</p>
        <p>''I got a call from the 3d Armored Division commander,'' Mr. Powell recalled in his 1995 memoir, ''My American Journey.'' ''The Greens had planted a hundred young trees during the night right down the middle of our tank driving range. 'General, I'm just gonna flatten 'em,' Griffin told me.''</p>
        <p>'' 'Hold on, Tom,' I said. 'One does not casually run over trees in Germany.' Instead, we dug them up and replanted them in our housing area,'' and arranged ''an Earth-Day type celebration to which the Greens were invited but did not come. We, nevertheless, thanked them for helping improve our landscape,'' Mr. Powell recalled. ''With a little imagination, you can turn a knock into a boost.'' (Underlying the rift: NATO isn't what it was, page 3)</p>
