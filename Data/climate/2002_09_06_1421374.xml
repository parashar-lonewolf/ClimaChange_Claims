        <p>Editorial says agreements reached at World Summit on Sustainable Development on ways to fight poverty while reducing environmental degradation can make meaningful difference if nations of world work seriously to enforce them; says conference was diminished by unenthusiastic participation of United States and absence of Pres Bush, alone among world leaders</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The 10-day World Summit on Sustainable Development, which concluded on Wednesday in Johannesburg, angered both environmentalists and those who dismiss multilateral accords as so much globaloney. But by any standard -- let alone the often debased one of United Nations-sponsored meetings -- the gathering was honorable and reasonably successful. The agreements that were reached on ways to fight poverty while reducing environmental degradation can make a meaningful difference if the nations of the world work seriously to enforce them.</p>
        <p>The conference was diminished by the unenthusiastic participation of the United States. President Bush, alone among major world leaders, decided not to go (although he did send Secretary of State Colin Powell for a brief stop and speech). The United States, which emits 25 percent of the world's greenhouse gases, joined the OPEC oil cartel (in what one critic called an ''axis of oil'') to oppose clear and binding targets to increase the use of solar and wind power. By acting as a spoiler on some issues, Washington missed an opportunity to display the kind of leadership that would help it in its other international pursuits.</p>

        <p>The 10-day World Summit on Sustainable Development, which concluded on Wednesday in Johannesburg, angered both environmentalists and those who dismiss multilateral accords as so much globaloney. But by any standard -- let alone the often debased one of United Nations-sponsored meetings -- the gathering was honorable and reasonably successful. The agreements that were reached on ways to fight poverty while reducing environmental degradation can make a meaningful difference if the nations of the world work seriously to enforce them.</p>
        <p>The conference was diminished by the unenthusiastic participation of the United States. President Bush, alone among major world leaders, decided not to go (although he did send Secretary of State Colin Powell for a brief stop and speech). The United States, which emits 25 percent of the world's greenhouse gases, joined the OPEC oil cartel (in what one critic called an ''axis of oil'') to oppose clear and binding targets to increase the use of solar and wind power. By acting as a spoiler on some issues, Washington missed an opportunity to display the kind of leadership that would help it in its other international pursuits.</p>
        <p>It's not as if the issues addressed by the conference were marginal ones. The delegates grappled with such basic problems as the fact that more than 13,000 people die each day from water-related diseases, more than 80 countries have per capita incomes lower than they were a decade ago, and some 2.4 billion people live without sanitation. Also on the agenda was the grim reality that land degradation from deforestation, waste disposal and overuse of fertilizers has rendered a third of the earth's soil unfit for growing food.</p>
        <p>The meeting did not come up with instant solutions, but it did offer a conceptual framework and a series of targets for how to go about reducing health and environmental problems in the coming decade or two while promoting economic growth. In fact, the simple recognition that economic development and environmental protection can work in tandem may be the summit's greatest contribution. Lack of sanitation means not only soiling the environment but increased human disease and poverty. Agreeing to halve the number of people without sanitation by 2015 -- as the meeting did -- makes both environmental and economic sense.</p>
        <p>Another wise move was the inclusion of corporations and nongovernmental organizations in the discussion. There may be no more efficient way to cut pollution, fight disease and reduce inequities in trade and aid than to include those participants who are major players and often former adversaries. AIDS will be conquered only with the help of drug companies. Nonetheless, the key will be governmental compliance. The United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, said there would be monitoring of goals and annual reports. Such follow-up is crucial. Without it, we may not only run out of fossil fuel. We may run out of time.</p>
