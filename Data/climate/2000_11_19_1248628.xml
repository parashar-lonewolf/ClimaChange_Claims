        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The $20 million grant by Ford and Amoco to Princeton University (Briefing, Oct. 22) to develop solutions for global warming is not as philanthropic as it sounds. This grant is limited to the process known as sequestering, or extracting carbon dioxide from the stack gases of electric utilities, purifying and compressing it and transferring it to the bottom of the ocean. This obviously would be a very complicated and expensive process. It is like a doctor telling an obese patient not to worry about overeating; he will remove the excess fat by liposuction. Reducing our use of fossil fuels is a more practical means of reducing our carbon dioxide emissions. We have technologies for getting energy by wind  and solar power and for using energy much more efficiently. The return on such investments are not high enough to be attractive right now, but they are the best way to assure a more secure future for our grandchildren.</p>
