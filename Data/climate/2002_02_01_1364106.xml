        <p>Taken as an episode of moguls in toyland, the World Economic Forum reveals that even the rich and powerful are on the prowl for yet another cool gadget, or just can't resist one. Every participant in the conference is being given a hand-held computer, called the Davos Companion. As conference freebies go, it quickly became quite the hot item. By 9 o'clock in the morning, the line of people waiting for the Companion snaked practically from 49th Street to 50th Street.</p>
        <p>As David Ervine, leader of a small political party in Northern Ireland, surveyed the line, he realized that the bespectacled man next to him was probably making the same calculations: Should he endure the wait, get the device and have the super-duper interactive conference experience it promised? Or should he just go find a printed schedule and sit in the meetings as if it were, say, 1999?</p>

        <p>Taken as an episode of moguls in toyland, the World Economic Forum reveals that even the rich and powerful are on the prowl for yet another cool gadget, or just can't resist one. Every participant in the conference is being given a hand-held computer, called the Davos Companion. As conference freebies go, it quickly became quite the hot item. By 9 o'clock in the morning, the line of people waiting for the Companion snaked practically from 49th Street to 50th Street.</p>
        <p>As David Ervine, leader of a small political party in Northern Ireland, surveyed the line, he realized that the bespectacled man next to him was probably making the same calculations: Should he endure the wait, get the device and have the super-duper interactive conference experience it promised? Or should he just go find a printed schedule and sit in the meetings as if it were, say, 1999?</p>
        <p>''I didn't come to New York to look at the carpet for an hour,'' Mr. Ervine declared.</p>
        <p>The man next to him seemed to agree, and when a woman called out, ''Mr. Gates!'' the founder of Microsoft, Bill Gates, peeled away from the gadget line, too.</p>
        <p>Most did not take that option. Over the course of the day, hundreds of the elite missed seminars, meetings and sessions addressing critical stuff like the future of life, or poverty and global warming, so they could get the gadget.</p>
        <p>''Waiting? Five minutes,'' barked David Stern, commissioner of the National Basketball Association, making it abundantly clear that he had no patience for what he saw as a cynical inquiry about the spectacle of hundreds of wealthy, influential people biding their time in a long line for a fancy toy. ''The organization is very effective.''</p>
        <p>Just ahead of Mr. Stern, Barry Gosin of Newmark Realty said the line for the little computer did not represent lost time at all. ''We're standing here talking, instead of standing around with a drink, talking,'' Mr. Gosin said, adding, ''Did you see there was one guy outside with a sign, protesting the lack of protesters?''</p>
        <p>Ruth J. Simmons, president of Brown University, said she had to be talked into coming to the conference by two members of the Brown board, so reluctant had she been to devote this much time to an event away from school at the start of the semester. Then she heard that she needed the Davos Companion to register for the sessions and keep track of the schedule.</p>
        <p>''I've been told it's very useful,'' she said, some 40 minutes into her wait.</p>
        <p>As for the patience of the crowd, she did not attribute it to their appetite for the computer, but to a more accommodating spirit forged by the stressful times. ''Ordinarily, these are very intense people -- they'd be crazy about the line,'' she said.</p>
        <p>As it happens, the organizers had made it possible to register for sessions without the hand-held computer, simply by going to a kiosk and checking in with registrars by showing an identification badge.</p>
        <p>The badges contained an invisible microchip, the conference literature explained. They also gave guests the  chance to sit down at any of dozens of laptop stations set up around the hotel, each crowned with a liquid-filled plastic obelisk rising from behind the screen. With each stroke on the keyboard, a stream of bubbles rose, giving the impression that important thoughts were being released into the air, as well as into cyberspace.</p>
        <p>And as if they had never left the office, people constantly checked their e-mail, or dialed their cellphones, or, for those willing to stare at the carpet long enough, beamed into the infrared receptors on their Davos Companions.</p>
        <p>The former Colorado senator Timothy E. Wirth greeted an acquaintance who was holding a computer bag of the kind doled out at many a convention.</p>
        <p>''How'd you get that?'' Mr. Wirth asked.</p>
        <p>The bag, it turned out, was available without standing in line for the little computer. The bag had an impressive heft, not unlike a bag full of bullion, one supposed. It turned out to contain inches of documentation about the conference, its technology and the people attending.</p>
        <p>Those documents hardly compared to a slim little hand-held computer. About a half-hour after Mr. Stern was first seen in line, he had moved about 60 feet closer to getting his.</p>
        <p>''That makes five more minutes,'' he called out. ''Five before, five now.''</p>
