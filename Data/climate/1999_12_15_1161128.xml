        <p>Millennium celebrations may still be a couple of weeks away, but symbolically the American Century ended here today with a ceremony marking the transfer of the Panama Canal to Panama.</p>
        <p>In 1903, nothing compared to Washington's decision to build the canal as a statement of the United States' determination to stand as a world power, even if it meant assisting Panama's secession from Colombia.</p>
        <p>And while the phrase American Century was actually coined by Henry Luce in 1941, it could have been the motto of President Theodore Roosevelt, who dominated the organizational, medical and engineering tour de force that connected the Atlantic and Pacific.</p>
        <p>Ninety-six years later, a festive ceremony noting the imminent turnover reflects the more patient and, above all, more cooperative role in the world the United States now says it seeks.</p>
        <p>Out of a late 20th-century sense of sovereignty and respect for somebody else's national pride, a great power is in fact voluntarily giving a piece of valuable national property to a tiny nation with no capacity to seize it.</p>
        <p>With the end of the cold war, the venturesome role of presidents like the first Roosevelt or Lyndon Johnson seems to have given way, if not fully to the anti-colonial and anti-imperialist views of Woodrow Wilson, then at least to a sense of the importance of consultation and coalition before bombs are dropped. In Korea and Vietnam, the United States acted first, then looked for allies. In the Persian Gulf and Kosovo, it sought allies first.</p>
        <p>Even President Clinton's decision to stay away from the ceremony, though it caused disappointment and even criticism here, meant that the United States would not dominate the day.</p>
        <p>That star role was left to President Mireya Moscoso of Panama, who used the occasion to build political bridges by hailing the Panamanian architect of the turnover, the late Gen. Omar Torrijos, even though he seized power by a coup that ousted her late husband from the presidency.</p>
        <p>Today's events went without a hitch, except for a soloist who mangled the words to the Star Spangled Banner. But these events were entirely symbolic.</p>
        <p>The transfer of canal authority has been going on since the treaty was ratified in 1978, and indeed the final step will not be taken until Dec. 31, with far less hoopla.</p>
        <p>President Moscoso and former President Jimmy Carter, leading the United States' delegation, signed a piece of paper in essence promising to keep on implementing the transfer treaty.</p>
        <p>But the almost casual American approach to giving away the canal that cost it $352 million and 5,609 lives should not obscure the difficulties Mr. Carter had in winning Senate ratification with only a single vote to spare -- even though then, as now, not a single American aircraft carrier would fit into the canal and nuclear submarines never used it.</p>
        <p>Ronald Reagan's rhetoric -- ''We bought it. We built it. It's ours and we are going to keep it.'' -- resonated with Republicans (despite support for the treaty from ex-Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford), and fears of Cuban and Soviet aggression made some votes to ratify into tickets to electoral defeat.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carter scoffed today at treaty opponents as ''demagogues'' and said, ''There are still a few of them in my nation today.''</p>
        <p>But in fact critics of Panama's administration of the canal have made no impact. One longtime foe of the handover, Howard Phillips of the Conservative Caucus, was in Panama today calling for a new treaty to re-establish American bases, and offering to help clean up unexploded ordnance in the jungle in return.</p>
        <p>He also demanded that Panama cancel a port-management contract with Hutchison-Whampoa, a worldwide company based in Hong Kong, which he charged would provide a foothold for China to threaten the canal's security.</p>
        <p>Most of today's talk was of cooperation. Mrs. Moscoso spoke of efforts to make the canal ''a world class enterprise that will permit it to continue offering safe, efficient and competitive service to the international maritime community.'' Mr. Carter said the United States wanted to be ''a full partner, a harmonious partner, an equal partner to answer any request to come from Panama to make the canal even greater in the next millennium.''</p>
        <p>On most international issues, from global warming to trade to poison gas or atomic bombs, the United States government seeks agreements among many or all nations. It often fails, and frequently does not convince its own people of the need for sacrifice some see in these agreements. But even when it acts unilaterally, as by raising tariffs on some French luxury foods, it follows procedures authorized internationally.</p>
        <p>The engineering may have been harder, but the world was a simpler place for Theodore Roosevelt. No one except the Colombians and a few senators, many of whom favored a different canal route, objected to the American help given the Panamanian revolution.</p>
        <p>But some things remain the same. The United States could dream of a canal because it was the world's foremost economic power. The huge steel plates for the gates of the Miraflores locks came from Pittsburgh, while the hardware -- bearings, valves, gears and struts -- came from Wheeling, W.Va.</p>
        <p>Today the American economy is still the world's greatest.</p>
        <p>Nor was boldness the only measure of Roosevelt's foreign policy. In 1905, settling on a new chief engineer for the canal distracted him at least briefly from efforts to mediate the end of the Russo-Japanese war, for which he won the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
        <p>That sort of role has remained a United States value as the American Century ends. President Clinton did not come here today, but he will be trying to help Israel and Syria make peace in Washington on Wednesday.</p>
