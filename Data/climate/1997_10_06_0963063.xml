        <p>Shift in Banking Rules, With Caution, Is Urged  Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, called for an overhaul of Federal rules so that banks could keep pace with technological changes and new competition.</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenspan said he sympathized with bankers who want a freer hand to compete with other financial institutions and overseas rivals entering their turf. But he also cautioned that Congress and regulators should move slowly in making changes. [Page D2.]</p>
        <p>America Online Plans Revamping  America Online plans to begin overhauling its service in an effort to attract another two million to three million subscribers. [D6.]</p>
        <p>New Target For Nader  Microsoft, which has so far fended off accusations from competitors that it holds monopoly power over the computer software industry, has drawn a new adversary, the consumer advocate Ralph Nader. [D10.]</p>
        <p>European Privatization Moves  The push to privatize European telecommunications companies continued as Italy said it would sell its remaining stake in Telecom Italia and the initial offering of France Telecom was expected to be priced at the upper end of the anticipated range. [D8.]</p>
        <p>Untethered Internet Access  AT&amp;T's Wireless Services division plans to announce the retail introduction of a service -- previously available to corporate customers -- that permits a cellular phone user to tap into a variety of information sources and electronic mail via the Internet. [D9.]</p>
        <p>New Economics for Bookstores  For many of the estimated 300 American bookstores aiming at black readers -- like the Phenix Information Center in San Bernardino, Calif. -- the new economics of the publishing industry means a forced course in self-reliance, as booksellers must depend less on publishers and more on their own ideas for marketing events. [D11.]</p>
        <p>$25 Million Damage Award  Freed from a secrecy agreement, the American Booksellers Association has started alerting its national membership that it won a $25 million damage award in its dispute with Penguin Group over discounts arising from the publisher's accounting scandal. [D10.]</p>
        <p>Beyond 'Ren and Stimpy'  John Kricfalusi, who created ''The Ren and Stimpy Show'' but was dismissed by Nickelodeon because of ''creative differences,'' is taking his offbeat animations -- characters like Jimmy the Idiot Boy, left -- and his compatriot, George Liquor, to another venue: the Internet. [D11.]</p>
        <p>Key Affirmative Action Case  The new Supreme Court term brings the most important affirmative action case in years, an appeal by a New Jersey school district that dismissed a white teacher to preserve a black teacher's job. [A13.]</p>
        <p>Global Warming Debate Shifts  With President Clinton agreeing to the dominant view among scientists that global warming is a serious matter, debate has largely shifted to the question of how restricting emissions of greenhouse gases may affect the economy. [A1.]</p>
        <p>Hard Candy  Washington State is the home of postmodern corporate giants like Microsoft. But it also has small-town businesses reminiscent of a quainter era, like Liberty Orchards, which makes a chewy candy called Aplets and Cotlets -- but which has itself decided to play a modern game of corporate hardball. [A1.]</p>
