        <p>If she weren't a politician, Christie Whitman once told a biographer, she would have been a rancher somewhere out west.</p>
        <p>Between politics and the great outdoors, it is hard to say which is the favorite milieu of Mrs. Whitman, who has combined the two frequently in her seven years as governor of New Jersey. And so her appointment by President-elect George W. Bush as the next administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency might seem a natural fit.</p>
        <p>Like the president-elect, Mrs. Whitman is the proud standard-bearer of a line of Republican royalty reaching back nearly a century. Her two grandfathers each served as the party's chief financier in New Jersey; her father steered the state party through its darkest years. At 5, Christie Todd named her dog Ike. At 6, in December 1952, she was taken to meet President-elect Dwight D. Eisenhower himself.</p>
        <p>So, too, Mrs. Whitman's naturalist streak as governor -- from her fondness for canoe trips and bicycle tours to her billion-dollar commitment to preserve open space in the nation's most densely populated state -- has its roots in her upbringing at Pontefract, the family farm in the New Jersey hunt country where she still resides, an hour and a half west of New York City.</p>
        <p>Yet Governor Whitman's record also suggests that her new position will require a fair amount of adjusting.</p>
        <p>She earned her environmental credentials mainly in the area of conservation, which is more the province of the Interior Department, but critics say her administration has also done much to weaken regulations and ease enforcement of pollution standards, which constitute the primary mission of the E.P.A.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman's imperial style, too, may make her better suited to being an executive than a coalition builder, and raises questions about how well she will work with Congress and with the White House, which traditionally has closely controlled the environmental agency's policymaking, top personnel appointments and budget. As one of the nation's most powerful governors, she has often angered New Jersey lawmakers, even in her own party, by handing down major policy pronouncements without seeking their input.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Bush promised today to elevate the administrator's job to a cabinet position, Mrs. Whitman's appointment to a post no other governor has held also reflects to a degree her fallen star within the party to which she has devoted her life. After winning election in 1993 as the first woman to be New Jersey's governor, she helped revive the Republican moderate wing and was for a time considered a potential presidential candidate herself. But her support for abortion rights, anathema to conservatives, not only ruled out a place on a national ticket but also may have prevented her from taking a more prominent role in Mr. Bush's cabinet.</p>
        <p>''She's a quick learner,'' said former Gov. Thomas H. Kean, a family friend who plucked Mrs. Whitman from a county freeholders board to serve in his cabinet as president of the Board of Public Utilities, her first statewide post, in 1988. ''When you get into the E.P.A., you're thrown into a lot of technical problems that she hasn't had to deal with as governor. She'll learn, and I think she'll be quite good. But the important thing is that George Bush listen to her.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, Governor Whitman's appointment, friends say, is a testament to her strong and mutually respectful friendship with the president-elect. The two, who are both 54, did not get to know each other until she offered to help Mr. Bush on the stump in his 1994 campaign for governor of Texas. But they nonetheless shared much history.</p>
        <p>Born Christine Temple Todd on Sept. 26, 1946, in New York, Mrs. Whitman was the youngest child of Eleanor and Webster Todd, for decades New Jersey's most prominent Republican couple. Her maternal grandparents knew Senator Prescott Bush, the president-elect's grandfather, a bond that was reinforced in a second generation; the late Eleanor Todd and Barbara Bush were very good friends, according to Patricia Beard, author of a 1996 biography of Governor Whitman.</p>
        <p>The Bush-Whitman relationship was not without its strains, Ms. Beard said. In 1990, Mrs. Whitman, then a longshot challenger to Senator Bill Bradley, felt snubbed by the Bush family, Ms. Beard said: then-President Bush made only a perfunctory campaign appearance with Mrs. Whitman at the Newark airport while traveling to New York.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, in his fall campaign this year and its aftermath, George W. Bush relied heavily on Governor Whitman: she campaigned for him in more than 20 states, served as a Bush spokeswoman at the Democratic convention and on countless television shows, and made a much-photographed pilgrimage to observe the Florida recount.</p>
        <p>As administrator of the E.P.A., Mrs. Whitman will oversee a bureaucracy roughly one-third the size of New Jersey's state government, and will be caught between environmental advocates on the left and Mr. Bush and his conservative allies on the right. She seemed to acknowledge that today in accepting Mr. Bush's nomination, citing ''the need to strike an appropriate balance between competing interests for the good of all Americans.''</p>
        <p>To environmentalists, Mrs. Whitman is full of potential, if her record so far is mixed.</p>
        <p>Her critics praise Mrs. Whitman for cleaning up thousands of industrial sites in New Jersey, but say she did so in part by easing the requirements for such cleanups. She introduced an ambitious set of water-quality regulations to help rein in suburban sprawl, but her first proposal so lowered pollution standards that the E.P.A. stepped in to reject it. New Jersey was a leader in setting targets for cleaning the air of greenhouse gases, but a contract to build enhanced automobile emissions-inspection stations was a catastrophic failure.</p>
        <p>But even her most dogged critics in Trenton say Mrs. Whitman has often proved sympathetic to the environmental cause when she took a direct interest in a divisive issue.</p>
        <p>''Christie Whitman as E.P.A. commissioner will be really interesting,'' said David S. Pringle, a lobbyist for the New Jersey Environmental Federation. ''When she has really gotten her hands wet, her policies have been much better for the environment, than when she delegated them. The question is, will Governor Whitman exert herself in a Bush administration, and will President-elect Bush allow her to exert herself to be an effective environmental advocate?''</p>
