        <p>This Sunday marks one of the great moments in the American end-of-the-year holiday extravaganza, the much-loved busiest travel day in the history of U.S. aviation.</p>
        <p>Unlike Thanksgiving or Christmas or New Year's Eve, which focus on the concepts of family and friendship, Busiest Travel Day is a time to get together with total strangers. Huddled together in the intimacy of coach class, we exchange seasonal grunts over our miniaturized bags of pretzels, perhaps lifting our four-ounce glasses of diet cola to toast the captain's news that we are being diverted to Pittsburgh.</p>
        <p>Or, buoyed by the information that we are 47th in line for takeoff, we can cuddle under one of the airline blankets, beloved artifacts that are passed on from generation to generation of frequent fliers. The blankets became mired in controversy this week when critics charged that the laundry that's supposed to dry-clean them actually often just fluffs and folds. ''A sampling of blankets, pillowcases and headphones . . . were submitted to laboratory analysis, which revealed the existence of pathogens and potential pathogens,'' said an official for the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the laundry denied the charges. All I can tell you, people, is that this is the sort of national conversation we get to enjoy only during union organizing drives and divorce suits.</p>
        <p>We have been experiencing national air gridlock for some time now. Those of us who fly a lot are not going to allow any holiday travelers to tell their tales of woe until they have listened to our story about being stranded in the Paducah, Ky., airport for 14 hours, sustained only by a fuzzy breath mint and a can of Mountain Dew.</p>
        <p>Highly paid experts believe the current crisis just might be related to the fact that the numbers of flights and passengers are growing way faster than the numbers of airports and runways. However, the jury is out -- as, no doubt, are the contracts for a large number of additional studies.</p>
        <p>The Federal Aviation Administration's 10-year, $12 billion program to upgrade the air traffic control system was a bust, and its software uses a 40-year-old language that's the computer equivalent of Etruscan. Plans are under way to modernize the software, but it will have to wait in line behind other important government priorities, such as ending global warming and reforming the Electoral College. We are also running out of radio channels for the pilots to use when they talk to the air traffic controllers, but the F.A.A. has its eye on a system that will solve the problem forever by the dawn of the next millennium. (There are some indications that the F.A.A.'s talents do not lie along the shopping line, but we will need a really, really extensive study in order to be sure.)</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, these three things we know to be true: Flight delays are up about 50 percent for the past five years. If one drop of rain falls on La Guardia Airport, the cancellations are heard round the world. And the fried rice at Dulles Airport has 615 calories, whereas the pecan bun at National has 1,100. A friend of mine who lived for some time in Russia says the only short-term answer to the airport problem is to accept the fact that from the consumer's point of view, we have re-invented Aeroflot. She always travels with several books, water, a pillow and enough fruit to sustain her for 24 hours.</p>
        <p>The airports, for their part, are encouraging their retail stores to stock more equipment for long-term camping, like disposable diapers, pantyhose and shaving equipment. So far nobody has thought of a bedroll rental business, yet another sign that the free market is not always all it's cracked up to be.</p>
        <p>The airports really ought to be installing little napatoriums, where you could rent a cot and pillow by the hour. There is no current plan for a napatorium at La Guardia, the hellmouth of air transport. But an official for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey says that the airport's ''medium-range'' capital program does call for better furniture in the waiting rooms. ''We're going to look at a range of models currently on the market and try to select the most comfortable seats,'' he vowed, in what sounded like an excellent example of medium-range planning.</p>
        <p>Until then, you can allegedly ask an airport redcap to get you a blanket and pillow. The pathogens would be extra.</p>
