        <p>Here at the foot of a still snow-covered Mount St. Helens, a gentle, new spring is hatching as alder trees leaf out, the first warblers sing, salamanders squirm out of gooey eggs and the Toutle River rushes toward its destination.</p>
        <p>But while peaceful today, 20 years ago this valley was rocked as Mount St. Helens exploded in an eruption so powerful that it shot ash and steam out at more than 200 miles an hour, filled this broad valley with the largest landslide in recorded human history and flattened trees over hundreds of square miles -- in minutes, changing this landscape forever.</p>
        <p>The eruption of Mount St. Helens, the two-decade anniversary of which will be this Thursday, has also radically changed the way that biologists look at the creation and recovery of natural landscapes.</p>
        <p>In 1980, researchers say it was dogma among ecologists that nature creates and recreates ecosystems in an orderly fashion with predictable parades of species rolling in: the early pioneering species first, which alter the environment, making possible the arrival of the second wave of species and so on, until the final array of plants and animals is in place.</p>
        <p>By providing the perfect laboratory to test such ideas -- more than 200 square miles of newly devastated terrain -- Mount St. Helens has turned that theory upside down. Biologists have discovered instead the unpredictability of recolonization and the pivotal importance of chance  in the rebuilding of biological communities.</p>
        <p>''We knew very clearly what was going to happen afterward,'' said Dr. Jerry F. Franklin, a forest ecologist at the University of Washington, ''and we were very clearly wrong.''</p>
        <p>The lessons learned, researchers say, have provided critical insights for foresters, conservationists and others looking to rebuild ecosystems that have been drastically altered.</p>
        <p>Because St. Helens was also the first massive eruption in a developed country within driving distance of a number of major universities, it is unrivaled as a model for ecosystem recovery.</p>
        <p>''The intensity of the work that is being carried out there,'' said Dr. Eldon H. Franz, an ecosystem ecologist at Washington State University, ''I don't think it will be matched anywhere.''</p>
        <p>Now, at the 20-year mark, with patches of alders taking hold, brave clumps of sedges, fireweeds and lupines clinging to the rocky hills, and moths, trout and bluebirds increasing their numbers in the area, researchers are finally beginning to see, not just how a few lucky survivors can hold on, but what happens as whole communities of species begin to take shape.</p>
        <p>Pointing out the struggling young willows that have begun to feel the effects of the growing corps of animals -- from stem-boring beetles to leaf-chewing elk to trunk-biting beavers -- Charlie Crisafulli, an ecologist at the Forest Service's Pacific Northwest Research Station, said, ''Now things are really going to get interesting.''</p>
        <p>Even while standing here on heaps of volcanic debris, staring into the remains of the exploded crater, a visitor can find it hard to fathom the enormousness of the events on that fateful day.</p>
        <p>Within moments, a lush Northwestern forest was transformed into a variety of entirely novel habitats. The pyroclastic zone, also known as the pyroclastic flow, was created where hot pumice poured out of the volcano, sterilizing the earth. The debris avalanche consisted of a 14-mile landslide of ash and rocks, some the size of large buildings. The blowdown zone consisted of countless conifers burnt to a crisp and toppled over like so many seared toothpicks.</p>
        <p>According to the neat logic of ecological theory, mosses and lichens, able to survive the harshest conditions, should have been the first to take hold in these ruined places. Then wildflowers and other herbs should have come in, followed by deciduous trees and finally conifers like the firs and hemlocks. And re-colonization should have rolled inward from the edges where life remained unharmed to the core of the devastation.</p>
        <p>Instead, what created the new landscape was not this set of rules but the organisms that were lucky enough to survive the blast.</p>
        <p>In this largely lifeless scene, biologists soon discovered pockets of survivors -- biological legacies, as they are now called. Moles, northern pocket gophers and ants made it through the blast because they were hidden beneath the ground. Saplings and shrubs that were still buried in early spring snow survived the blast that killed the taller trees poking up above them. A few roots and bulbs of wildflowers, like lupines and fireweeds, tumbled along the top of the rolling avalanche, as opposed to being buried 600 feet below, and set up shop as soon as the ground stopped moving.</p>
        <p>From a few such crucial hangers-on sprinkled throughout the devastation, much of the first life here has slowly sprung -- a process scientists now recognize as a critical part of  recovery in any disturbed biological system.</p>
        <p>''St. Helens was the epiphany where finally the scales fell from our eyes and we said, 'Oh my gosh, we haven't been thinking clearly,' '' said Dr. Franklin. ''The most important things we need to think about are the legacies left in the landscape. The richness of the legacy of organisms that was there, the rapidity with which recovery occurred and the incredible diversity of ways in which organisms were able to survive -- it just astounded us.''</p>
        <p>As a result of these findings, many foresters now leave 15 percent or more of the trees and deadwood behind after a harvest as a kind of biological legacy to speed the rebirth of a new forest.</p>
        <p>''The real value of all these studies is what we can learn about management for other human-created systems,'' said Dr. Virginia Dale, an ecologist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. ''We have strip mines and roadsides and all kinds of devastation created by human activities.''</p>
        <p>At its most extreme, St. Helens provided a chance for biologists to study the recreation of habitats from a clean slate in the pyroclastic zone, where a sterilized surface that had never before supported life was laid down.</p>
        <p>Scientists are still sorting out the many factors that allow crucial nitrogen and carbon, the building blocks for living organisms, to accumulate in the pyroclastic zone. But Dr. Franz said they already know that chance played an important role. Wherever lupine seeds happen to blow in and find a crevice to take hold, they begin laying down carbon and nitrogen in abundance. Lupine plants are particularly well suited to this habitat, as they can, with the help of bacteria, create their own sources of vital nitrogen.</p>
        <p>Around the volcano, curious new communities are also beginning to take shape.</p>
        <p>In many of the 120 ponds created in the debris avalanche and in Spirit Lake, the northwestern salamander has taken up residence. These animals have a habit of leaving the water in search of forest, which at Mount St. Helens can leave them wandering and dying in desert-like landscapes. But the northwestern salamander is thriving here, with help in part from species like the northern pocket gopher and the elk.</p>
        <p>Mr. Crisafulli said his team finds traveling salamanders in nearly every gopher tunnel they inspect. These creatures appear to be making their way across the harsh terrain via the gopher's cool, moist subway system. The elk assist by collapsing tunnels with their hooves as they tromp along, creating easy entrance for the salamanders into the underground transit.</p>
        <p>Compared with areas in which organisms have had the benefit of millenniums to get established, St. Helens remains a system out of whack, researchers say. There are strange goings-on, from surprisingly large numbers of typically rare species to species found in unexpected places.</p>
        <p>Birds like pipits and rosy finches, typically found in sparse, high-elevation areas, can be found in the low-elevation pyroclastic zone. Species like the western toad and the red-legged frog, which are endangered or threatened elsewhere, flourish at Mount St. Helens.</p>
        <p>Researchers guessed it might take several hundred years to return to what once was, a grand, old-growth forest, for example, on the debris avalanche where evergreen trees now come up to a person's knee and most of the ground is still barren.</p>
        <p>But a number of things could interfere with that long-term prognosis. One is global warming, but the biggest is Mount St. Helens itself, the most active volcano in the Cascade Mountains, with an average eruption cycle of 200 years.</p>
        <p>Researchers say the mountain had still not completely recovered from an eruption in the 1800's when it exploded again in 1980. The treeline had returned only part way up the flanks of Mount St. Helens when the latest eruption interrupted its upward march.</p>
        <p>Just 20 short years into the process, scientists say they have yet to learn just where all this change is headed or what will be here on this very spot 10, 100 or more years from now.</p>
        <p>''The story,'' said Dr. Fred Swanson, a research geologist with the Forest Service's Pacific Northwest Research Station, ''is just unfolding.''</p>
