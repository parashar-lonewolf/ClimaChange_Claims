        <p>ALBANY, Jan. 10  New York State filed a lawsuit today charging that two power plants near Buffalo violate federal clean-air laws.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>New York State filed a lawsuit today charging that two power plants near Buffalo violate federal clean-air laws.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit accuses the plants, Huntley and Dunkirk, of making multimillion-dollar improvements without installing better air pollution controls as required by the federal Clean Air Act. The plants were built in stages in the 1940's and 1950's by the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation, which also made the improvements that are being challenged. In 1999, the utility sold the plants to NRG Energy of Minneapolis. Both companies are named as defendants.</p>
        <p>Ken Tompkins, a spokesman for Niagara Mohawk, defended the company's upgrades. ''The maintenance and repairs at the two facilities were routine and complied with all state and federal requirements in effect when the work was performed,'' Mr. Tompkins said.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit puts the Pataki administration at odds with the White House, which is reviewing recommendations by top regulators that would relax restrictions under the Clean Air Act. The changes being considered would make lawsuits like this one all but impossible, and would allow older plants to continue emitting high levels of pollution.</p>
        <p>The state says the plants each pump into the air more than 50,000 tons of sulfur dioxide a year, more than twice as much as any other plant in the state. Sulfur dioxide is the main contributor to acid rain and fine particulate pollution.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists and state officials say the suit marks the first time any state has taken this kind of action against plants within its own borders. It was filed jointly by the state attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer, and the Department of Environmental Conservation. This is the first time the administration has joined in such a suit.</p>
        <p>''It's very significant that it's a Republican governor who's going in the opposite direction from the Republican administration in Washington,'' said Larry Shapiro, director of environmental enforcement for the Rockefeller Family Fund, a private group that studies environmental issues.</p>
        <p>In the next few days, Gov. George E. Pataki is expected to release regulations imposing pollution limits on all power plants in the state built before 1970. New York will be one of a very few states to do so, but environmentalists say they are disappointed that the rules do not go quite as far as the ones the governor proposed in 1999.</p>
        <p>Since 1970, federal laws have placed ever stricter limits on pollution from industrial plants, but pre-1970 plants are largely exempt. Under a provision of the Clean Air Act known as new-source review, an old plant that is significantly overhauled can be subject to the same stringent pollution controls as new plants.</p>
