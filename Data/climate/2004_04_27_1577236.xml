        <p>In California, at a secret location in Humboldt Redwoods State Park, stands a 369-foot-high titan that is both the tallest living tree and the tallest organism on earth. Yet this behemoth, the height of a 30-story building, is still growing, begging the question: How tall can a tree get?</p>
        <p>To find an answer, a research team has performed an act of scientific derring-do, hauling themselves and their equipment into the top of the world's tallest trees. Reporting in the current Nature, the researchers confirm a longstanding hypothesis that the ultimate obstacle to growing ever higher is water, or lack of it. They predict that even the most rugged trees will be stopped in their tracks at a parching altitude between 400 and 427 feet high.</p>
        <p>''It gets spindly up there,'' said Dr. George Koch, lead author and physiological ecologist at Northern Arizona University. ''I'll tell you, it's quite an amazing feeling.''</p>
        <p>As they climbed, the researchers found the leaves seemed to suffer progressively from a lack of water. More and more like desert leaves, they were smaller, denser, less able to take in carbon dioxide and less efficient at photosynthesizing -- all resulting in slower and, at some extreme, no growth.</p>
        <p>The problem, they say, is that water moves passively in plants, evaporating out of leaves and thereby drawing water upward through the plant from the roots. The higher the leaves, the greater the struggle against gravity and so the drier they tend to be.</p>
        <p>To estimate the maximum height for trees, the researchers extrapolated out to the height that water could no longer be drawn upward and leaves could no longer function.</p>
        <p>History appears to bear the scientists out.</p>
        <p>They note that the tallest reliably measured tree ever was a Douglas fir in the Lynn Valley of British Columbia, near Vancouver, which at 413 feet falls neatly into their predicted range.</p>
        <p>And, in any event, that's probably awesome enough.</p>
