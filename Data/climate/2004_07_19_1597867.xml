        <p>BEFORE he immigrated to the United States at the end of the Cold War, Boris Altshuler worked for the Soviet army designing chemical weapons.</p>
        <p>These days, Dr. Altshuler is working on the defensive end of chemical warfare. Last month he and his partner, James F. Reynolds, received United States patent 6,752,146 for an invention designed to protect the average American citizen against a biological or chemical attack: a baseball cap outfitted with a gas mask.</p>
        <p>The cap, the inventors say, is lightweight and small enough to tuck into a corner of a drawer, coat pocket or briefcase.</p>
        <p>''Professional gas masks are expensive, heavy and cumbersome,'' said Mr. Reynolds, who is president of CR Clean Air Technologies, an air pollution control technology company in Westfield, N.J., where Dr. Altshuler works. ''So after 9/11 we sat down together and tried to design a lightweight mask that would be useful to the average person.''</p>
        <p>The Altshuler-Reynolds mask is a version of what is known as a ''supplied-air respirator.'' Wearers, instead of using their lungs to suck in air that passes through a filter, breathes purified air that has been propelled by a small fan through a filter into the mask.</p>
        <p>This creates positive air pressure, so that if the mask leaks anywhere, the mask will force purified air to out rather than allow contaminated air to flow in.</p>
        <p>The mask relies on activated carbon -- made of material similar to that found in charcoal barbecue briquettes -- which CR Clean Air normally uses on an industrial scale to scrub the air of coal-burning power stations.</p>
        <p>The carbon is built into the brim of the hat and filters contaminated air. The mask itself is basically a sheet of transparent plastic no thicker than a standard shower cap that drapes down from the bill and sides of the baseball cap and is tied at the back of the neck.</p>
        <p>According to the patent, the mask ''allows full visual effectiveness with enough roominess to avoid claustrophobic reactions.''</p>
        <p>The disadvantage of this type of respirator is that it causes the filter to deplete rapidly. Indeed, the mask will not last very long.</p>
        <p>''Our niche is immediate removal from the area that is contaminated,'' Mr. Reynolds said. ''The filter should last between 15 and 30 minutes. If you're on the subway that should be long enough for you to throw this thing on, and use it until you get up the steps into fresh air.''</p>
        <p>What kind of chemicals is it designed to protect against? The patent does not specify but Dr. Altshuler said it would protect against a wide range of gaseous chemical and biological agents, including Sarin, which was used in a terrorist attack in a Tokyo subway in 1995.</p>
        <p>Certainly, there is no dearth of entrepreneurs appealing to security concerns of citizens about the possibility of the terrorist attacks.</p>
        <p>John Haaga, a doctor in Cleveland, came up with the idea of manufacturing fashion scarves and ties out of the same material used in surgical masks so that in a crisis commuters can fashion them into makeshift masks.</p>
        <p>In 2002, the Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a recall for 27,400 emergency escape hoods produced by Brookdale International Systems Inc. Marketed as being effective against biological and chemical agents, the EVAC-U8 Emergency Escape Smoke Hoods are actually good only for filtering out carbon dioxide from smoke during a fire, according to the safety commission.</p>
        <p>Some gas masks and ''escape hoods'' on the market are about as effective as the eBay-purchased time-traveling machine featured in the movie ''Napoleon Dynamite.'' That is to say, not very.</p>
        <p>The Internet appears to be flooded with gas masks being recycled from former Soviet republics. One vendor, www.approvedgasmasks.com, warns against masks whose filters are so old they are useless. One such mask, it contends, is the Russian M41 Aardvark Protective Mask.</p>
        <p>''These Russian masks are a triumph in the world of completely useless gas masks, possibly the worst mask still being sold,'' according to the site. It could be used ''as a Halloween costume or conversation piece but it will provide 0 percent protection.''</p>
        <p>The site offers its own ''escape hood'' which does not appear to have positive air pressure, meaning that a wearer would have to have a tight seal in order for it to work. The mask sells for $139.50</p>
        <p>The main advantages to their mask, Dr. Altshuler and Mr. Reynolds say, are that it is easily stowed, would fit children as well as adults, and would sell for as little as $20. Shopping malls, schools, employers and transit centers could afford to stock up on thousands of them to have on hand in case of an attack, Mr. Reynolds said.</p>
        <p>CR Clean Air Technologies is not planning to manufacture the mask, however, because it is not related to the company's core business of producing technology that reduces industrial air-pollution emissions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reynolds said he and Dr. Altshuler intended to license the device to a worldwide consumer products company ''because we don't really have the time to develop it ourselves.''</p>
        <p>Despite the fact that it is attached to a baseball cap, the Altshuler-Reynolds mask may not be much more aesthetically pleasing than gas masks already on the market, which give the wearer an alienlike appearance.</p>
        <p>''It looks a little silly,'' Mr. Reynolds acknowledged. ''But it works.''</p>
