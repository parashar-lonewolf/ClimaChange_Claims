        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Blair Says Bush's State Visit Comes at 'the Right Time' '' (news article, Nov. 18) does not mention that the address that President Bush had been expected to give to members of both houses of Parliament has been canceled. I hear that it has been canceled because members of Parliament were likely to express their opinions.</p>

        <p>Your readers should not go away with the impression that the protests are simply antiwar protests. The willful ignoring of international institutions and treaties is exemplified by the fact that the Iraq war was undertaken without a United Nations mandate. But there are plenty of other examples, from the Kyoto Protocol on climate change to the World Trade Organization rules on tariffs.</p>
        <p>People in Britain want to be part of a world where globalization means that nations work on world problems together. We are sorry that our friend the United States is being led away from that position. We would have liked the chance to tell that to your president.</p>
        <p>SUE MILLER  London, Nov. 18, 2003</p>
        <p>The writer, baroness of Chilthorne Domer, is a member of the House of Lords.</p>
