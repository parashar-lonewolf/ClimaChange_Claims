        <p>LEAD: Michael K. Deaver, who left the White House to form a multimillion-dollar lobbying business, was indicted by a Federal grand jury today on charges that he lied to the panel and to Congress about his lobbying activities.</p>
        <p>Michael K. Deaver, who left the White House to form a multimillion-dollar lobbying business, was indicted by a Federal grand jury today on charges that he lied to the panel and to Congress about his lobbying activities.</p>
        <p>The indictment, which had been expected, was returned only hours after Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist rejected Mr. Deaver's last-minute request to block it, noting that courts have traditionally been unwilling to interfere with criminal investigations.</p>
        <p>The five-count perjury indictment of Mr. Deaver, a close friend of President Reagan's who has remained a key adviser to Mr. Reagan and his wife, Nancy, followed a nine-month investigation by the court-appointed special prosecutor, Whitney North Seymour Jr. Law Enacted in 1978 Mr. Deaver, the former deputy White House chief of staff, became the first person indicted under the provisions of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 allowing for the appointment of special prosecutors, formally known as independent counsels.</p>
        <p>After the indictment today, Mr. Deaver, in a short appearance before reporters outside the lobby of the Georgetown building that houses his office, read a typed statement denying that he had committed perjury.</p>
        <p>In response to the indictment, President Reagan issued a three-sentence statement: ''Mike Deaver has been our friend for 20 years. Nancy and I will keep him and his family in our thoughts during these difficult times. We wish him well.'' Asserts Law Is Unconstitutional</p>
        <p>Last month, Mr. Deaver, who had earlier requested a special prosecutor in the case, tried to block the indictment through a lawsuit charging that the law was unconstitutional because it infringed on the law enforcement responsibilities of the executive branch.</p>
        <p>The investigation leading to the indictment was prompted by allegations that Mr. Deaver, who formed his lobbying concern after leaving the White House in 1985, had violated Federal ethics laws that restrict lobbying by those who held top positions in the Government.</p>
        <p>Ultimately Mr. Deaver was not charged with violations of those laws. Instead he was accused today of lying under oath when queried about his lobbying activities by the Federal grand jury in Washington and by a Congressional subcommittee.</p>
        <p>Under the ethics laws, former high-ranking officials are forbidden to lobby their old agencies on any matter for a year after leaving; to lobby any department for two years on an issue in which they had direct responsibility, or ever to lobby on issues in which they participated ''personally and substantially.''</p>
        <p>He was charged with lying in his answers about his involvement with the governments of Canada and South Korea as well as with two private concerns, Trans World Airlines and Smith Barney Harris Upham &amp; Company. 'My Testimony Was Truthful'</p>
        <p>''My testimony was truthful and correct on all of these subjects to the best of my recollection and beliefs,'' Mr. Deaver said. ''To the extent that there may have been inconsistencies between my testimony and the vast array of facts developed during Mr. Seymour's investigation, it was totally inadvertent.''</p>
        <p>According to the 18-page indictment, Mr. Deaver perjured himself twice while testifying before a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee last May and three times while testifying before the grand jury in June.</p>
        <p>One count charged that in his Congressional testimony, Mr. Deaver lied when he denied having contacted anyone in the West Wing of the White House regarding his lobbying.</p>
        <p>In fact, the indictment said, Mr. Deaver contacted at least four West Wing officials, including then Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter, the former national security adviser, on behalf of the International Cultural Society of Korea, one of Mr. Deaver's clients.</p>
        <p>The indictment also charged that in his appearance before the grand jury in June, Mr. Deaver perjured himself when he denied contacting any Government official on behalf of T.W.A.</p>
        <p>In fact, the indictment said, Mr. Deaver contacted Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole and her deputy, James Burnley, on behalf of the airline in its efforts to block a hostile takeover by Carl Icahn, the New York financier. Maximum Sentence of 25 Years</p>
        <p>The two charges of lying in front of Congress each carry a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $2,000 fine upon conviction. The three charges of making false declarations before a grand jury each carry a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.</p>
        <p>Legal experts have cautioned, however, that perjury is difficult to prove and that Mr. Seymour might have trouble demonstrating that Mr. Deaver intentionally misled Congress and the grand jury.</p>
        <p>The special prosecutor law, which was passed in the wake of the Watergate scandals, mandates appointment of special prosecutors, when senior Government officials are accused of wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Deaver challenged the constitutionality of that law, a Federal judge ruled that the suit was premature and that the law was probably constitutional. The decision was appealed to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which dismissed the lawsuit but did not address the constitutional questions.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, Mr. Deaver's lawyer asked Chief Justice Rehnquist to delay the grand jury's action.</p>
        <p>In a two-sentence statement today, the Chief Justice refused to block the indictment.</p>
        <p>''Applicant must overcome both the traditional rule that a court of equity will not enjoin a criminal prosecution and the presumption that an act of Congress is constitutional,'' the Chief Justice wrote. ''I am not satisfied that applicant has met this burden.'' Indictment Cites Other Instances</p>
        <p>The indictment charged three other instances of perjury by Mr. Deaver.</p>
        <p>According to the indictment, Mr. Deaver lied when he told the House subcommittee last May that he had done nothing to assist a representative of the Korean Government in obtaining a 1985 meeting with Mr. Reagan to deliver a letter on trade issues.</p>
        <p>In fact, the indictment said, Mr. Deaver's firm was intimately involved in arranging the meeting, suggested language for the letter and advised the American Ambassador to South Korea, Richard Walker, on how to organize an audience with the President.</p>
        <p>The indictment noted that the arrangements were made at the time that Mr. Deaver was negotiating a $475,000-a-year consulting arrangement with the Seoul Government.</p>
        <p>Another count charged Mr. Deaver with perjuring himself in the grand jury when he said that he had not participated in any White House discussion of acid rain until March 6, 1985.</p>
        <p>Canada eventually became a client of the Deaver firm, which was asked to represent Ottawa on questions involving the pollution problem.</p>
        <p>The indictment said Mr. Deaver had attended six White House meetings ''when the acid-rain question was discussed'' before March 6. The earliest meeting, it said, was on Dec. 11, 1984.</p>
        <p>The last count accused Mr. Deaver of lying when he denied speaking to anyone outside the Treasury Department in his representation of Smith Barney, which was seeking tax breaks for the Government of Puerto Rico.</p>
        <p>In fact, the indictment said, Mr. Deaver had discussed the Puerto Rico case with Secretary of State George P. Shultz; Craig Fuller, the Vice Presidential chief of staff, and Robert McFarlane, the former national security adviser. Success of Deaver's Business</p>
        <p>Mr. Deaver's public relations and lobbying concern in Washington, Michael K. Deaver &amp; Associates, was enormously successful, attracting powerful clients who paid millions of dollars in fees to take advantage of Mr. Deaver's access to the Reagan Administration.</p>
        <p>At the same time, however, Mr. Deaver's activities brought extensive publicity that portrayed him as having cashed in on his relationship with Mr. and Mrs. Reagan.</p>
        <p>His lobbying came under attack on Capitol Hill; the furor led Mr. Deaver, and then the Justice Department, to request appointment of a special prosecutor.</p>
        <p>In his appearance outside his office building today, Mr. Deaver appeared angry and forceful, although slightly nervous.</p>
        <p>''An independent counsel was appointed to investigate allegations that I had violated the conflict-of-interest laws,'' he said. ''The indictment that was returned today, which contained not a single conflict-of-interest charge, confirms that these allegations were groundless.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Deaver noted that he had appeared before Congress and the grand jury voluntarily. He said he ''testified for hours on end about the minute details of a wide range of activities both in the White House and after I started my business.''</p>
        <p>''I am confident that I have not committed any perjury and that I will be acquitted after a trial, if it ever gets to that point.''  The Special Prosecutors' Targets  After four special prosecutors investigated the burglary of the Watergate offices and other cases related to the 1972 election, the 1978 Ethics in Government Act established a procedure under which special prosecutors are appointed. In 1982 an amendment changed the title of the post to independent counsel. Since then there have been seven investigations and one indictment.  Michael K. Deaver: Indicted yesterday. Whitney North Seymour Jr. was appointed in May 1986 after months of public discussion over conflict of interest allegations against Mr. Deaver, who resigned as a top White House aide in May 1985.  John M. Poindexter and Oliver North: Among those under investigation by Lawrence E. Walsh for their role in the Iran arms affair. Mr. Walsh as been given broad powers to look into possible illegalities in the sale of military equipment to Iran and diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan rebels.  Lyn Nofziger: Under investigation. James C. McKay is reviewing allegations that Mr. Nofziger violated a Federal ethics law in his lobbying activities after serving as President Reagan's political director.  Theodore B. Olson: Under investigation. Alexia Morrison was appointed in May 1986 to continue a review Mr. McKay began the previous month into allegations that Mr. Olson gave false testimony when he was an Assistant Attorney General about the withholding of Environmental Proection Agency documents from Congressional investigators.  Edwin Meese 3d: Cleared of wrongdoing in September 1984 by a prosecutor, Jacob A. Stein, who had been appointed in April to review allegations concerning financial disclosure forms.  Raymond J. Donovan: No charges were brought by the special prosecutor, Leon Silverman, who was appointed in December 1981. However, Mr. Silverman said the allegations of corrupt practices remained disturbing. Later, New York State brought fraud charges against Mr. Donovan and he is on trial in State Supreme Court in the Bronx.  Tim Kraft: Cleared in early 1981 after an investigation by Gerald J. Gallinghouse into allegations that Mr. Kraft, Jimmy Carter's national campaign manager, had used drugs.  Hamilton Jordan: Cleared in 1980 by a prosecutor, Arthur H. Christy, who had been appointed the previous year to investigate allegations that Mr. Jordan, chief of staff in the Carter White House, had used cocaine.</p>
