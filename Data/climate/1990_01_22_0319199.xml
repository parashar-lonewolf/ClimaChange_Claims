        <p>LEAD: The 101st Congress returns to work on Tuesday in a world made new.</p>
        <p>The 101st Congress returns to work on Tuesday in a world made new.</p>
        <p>In the two months since the end of its lackluster first session, events in Eastern Europe and in Panama have created a set of new and thorny issues.</p>
        <p>In addition to taking up the old wars over capital gains, child care, clean air and drugs, the lawmakers now confront how to reshape the Pentagon budget and where to apply the proceeds - if any - of the ''peace dividend''</p>
        <p>Social Security and Retirement</p>
        <p>A proposal by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, to cut the Social Security tax and reorganize the bookkeeping for the retirement system promises to become a fierce battle and cause turmoil for both parties and shift the battle lines on cutting capital gains taxes.</p>
        <p>The investigation of seven influential Senators on charges of improper conduct and influence peddling has underscored long-festering problems with the campaign finance system. Leaders in both parties are now talking seriously about taking action this year to overhaul the system.</p>
        <p>''It seems to me we have to find some way to get a handle on how much we spend to get elected,'' said Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate Republican leader. The House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, noting Republican willingness to consider limits on campaign spending, said on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press'' today that major campaign reforms would be passed.</p>
        <p>The political climate has changed as well. The George Bush who last year offered Congress his hand in partnership, is now enjoying the highest public approval rating for this point in a term of any President since John F. Kennedy. He is stepping up attacks on Congress as the 1990 mid-term elections approach and the positioning for the 1992 Presidential contest begins.</p>
        <p>'It's Put-Up-or-Shut-Up Time'</p>
        <p>Lawmakers of both parties expect a more combative relationship with the White House and a more partisan edge to their own proceedings.</p>
        <p>''Right now the President is doing well with the American people,'' said Representative William H. Gray 3d of Pennsylvania, the House Democratic whip. ''But as we get into the substance of the second year, some tough decisions and leadership are going to be needed. It's put-up-or-shut-up time.''</p>
        <p>The same might be said for Congress. Its leaders insisted at the close of the 1989 session that judging the legislative record at that point would be as unfair as calling a football game at half-time.</p>
        <p>Over the weekend, a small group of ''activist'' House Democrats huddled with the majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, and with poll takers and media consultants, for discussion and advice.</p>
        <p>The Major Legislative Issues</p>
        <p>In a 1990 session that will be shortened by the demands of campaigning, several major issues loom:</p>
        <p>CLEAN AIR. On Tuesday the Senate will begin debating the first major overhaul of the nation's pollution laws in 13 years. The House will take up its version in the spring. Acid rain controls, alternative fuels and cost relief for the Midwest remain issues of contention, but Congressional leaders are comitted to passing a bill this year.</p>
        <p>CHILD CARE. In the House, the leadership must reconcile competing measures. The issue is whether to set up a new program of grants to the states that would require annual spending approval or to expand an existing program of automatic aid. A Senate bill combines the new grant program with expansion of existing tax credits for low-income parents. Mr. Bush favors the tax credit approach, but may balk at the Congressional price tag.</p>
        <p>DRUGS AND CRIME. A handful of bills introduced last year in response to Mr. Bush's drug and crime proposals may be amended to incorporate new ones he will make this year. Congress is likely to approve additional money for drug control, but differences remain over how it should be allocated.</p>
        <p>HOUSING. Democrats in both chambers want to provide money for construction of low-rent housing while the President has proposed emphasizing home ownership for the poor. House and Senate bills are still awaiting committee action.</p>
        <p>Two Disputed Laws Running Out</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, at least two perenially contentious laws are due to expire this year: one regulates the sale of advanced and military related technology to foreign countries and the other governs agriculture programs, including price supports for farmers. Congress must decide on the export law how to treat the new Governments in Eastern Europe. The farm bill will be affected by election-year pressures and environmental and budget concerns.</p>
        <p>The budget, of course, will dominate the session, and debate will be framed by decisions on Pentagon spending: how much can be cut to reflect a reduced Soviet threat and should the savings, when they eventually appear, be applied to domestic programs or reducing the deficit?</p>
        <p>''My strong inclination is to have the lion's share of savings go to deficit reduction,'' said Senator Jim Sasser, the Tennessee Democrat who heads the Senate Budget Committee. He sees $12 billion to $15 billion in military savings this year. Is It a Peace Dividend?  Other lawmakers, especially Republicans, see a much smaller amount and possibly none at all this soon. ''Anyway, it's not a peace dividend,'' said Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House Republican whip. ''It's a peace non-expense.''</p>
        <p>The list of programs competing for a share grows daily, and for the first time in many years it includes foreign aid.</p>
        <p>''We've bumped into the fact that in six different places in the world, our clout as a country depends on our ability to deliver some dollars,'' said Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn. ''We can't keep saing that we're the leading power in the world but that Japan is going to pay for it.''</p>
        <p>Dole's Suggested Aid Trims</p>
        <p>Senator Dole got the foreign aid debate off to an explosive start before Congress's return when he suggested that money for some of America's largest recipients of aid, including Israel and Egypt, be cut by 5 percent to make room for new aid to Eastern Europe.</p>
        <p>As for capital gains, Democrats succeeded in blocking a rate cut last year, but had been resigned to the inevitability of its passage this year, assuming that their main battle with the President would be how to shape it. As the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, noted with evident relish, all of that has changed in the wake of Mr. Moynihan's proposal and the President's attack on it.</p>
        <p>Most Democrats have been cautious in responding to the Moynihan plan, fearing it would raise the specter of cuts in benefits. ''Mr. Moynihan has exposed, for all to see, the inconsistencies of the Bush Administration's tax policy,'' Mr. Mitchell said. ''We can't cut taxes for the middle class and working class according to the President, but we should for the very wealthiest of Americans.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gingrich said a President with an approval rating as high as Mr. Bush's could afford to ''do whatever he wants to about Moynihan.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mitchell said: ''There is a curious premise that suggests if a President is doing well, Congress must be doing poorly. But the premise never seems to operate in reverse, so I've never accepted it.''</p>
