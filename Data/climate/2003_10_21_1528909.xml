        <p>An international panel of experts has approved the Bush administration's request for broad exemptions to a ban on methyl bromide, a pesticide that is popular with agricultural businesses but damages Earth's protective ozone layer.</p>
        <p>The ban, which applies to industrialized countries, is scheduled to take effect in 2005 under the Montreal Protocol, the 1987 treaty to eliminate chemicals that destroy ozone. The panel, assembled by the United Nations, can recommend exemptions if it finds that substitute chemicals would be unsafe or too expensive.</p>
        <p>In a report released over the weekend, the panel recommended a number of exemptions for the United States and a dozen much smaller countries. The largest were for American tomato and strawberry growers, who together are seeking to continue using more than 5,000 tons of methyl bromide a year. Other exemptions were for golf courses, flower growers and honey producers.</p>
        <p>The panel said it had recommended many of the exemptions with reservations, in the absence of hard data on possible substitutes. It said alternative chemicals were already being used on these crops elsewhere and wrote that it ''could not determine why some of these alternatives were not feasible.''</p>
        <p>Environmental groups say the United States and some other countries could undermine the treaty if they gain too many such exemptions, often as a favor to business interests. But yesterday, administration officials cited the panel's action as proof that its requests were justified.</p>
        <p>Experts on the treaty said the panel's recommendations were likely to strongly influence debate on the exemptions at the next meeting of parties to the treaty, which takes place next month in Nairobi.</p>
        <p>The analysis of the ''critical use nominations'' is on a United Nations Web site, www.unep.org/ozone. The panel said the extent of exemptions being sought by some of the world's wealthiest countries could slow development of less harmful substitutes and discourage poorer countries from moving speedily to adopt substitutes.</p>
        <p>But John F. Turner, an assistant secretary of state for international environmental and scientific affairs, defended the American position.</p>
        <p>''We're committed to the Montreal Protocol and committed to the phase-out of methyl bromide and finding alternatives,'' Mr. Turner said. ''But we balance that, quite frankly, with protecting some critical jobs and products, which are important to American businesses and American consumers.''</p>
