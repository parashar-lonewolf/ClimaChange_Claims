        <p>LEAD: The atmosphere's protective shield of ozone ebbed rapidly from 1979 through 1986, not just over Antarctica, where the depletion has been sharpest, but over nearly the whole globe, researchers said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The atmosphere's protective shield of ozone ebbed rapidly from 1979 through 1986, not just over Antarctica, where the depletion has been sharpest, but over nearly the whole globe, researchers said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Satellite observations show declines far more dramatic than had been expected from the effects in the atmosphere of manmade gases released from spray cans and refrigerants, or from natural processes alone. Ozone screens ultraviolet radiation from the sun; declines on the scale found by the satellite instruments could account for tens of thousands of extra skin cancers each year, studies have estimated. Vast Scope of Problem</p>
        <p>Worldwide ozone levels dropped 5 percent, according to a comprehensive analysis of the satellite data by an atmospheric scientist at the University of Illinois. The findings are reported in today's issue of the journal Science. Government researchers, working independently, are reaching comparable conclusions.</p>
        <p>Although scientists have long since established that the manmade gases, chlorofluorocarbons, pose a threat to the ozone layer, researchers have been hindered in demonstrating an actual depletion by the absence of solid data.</p>
        <p>''Ozone values have been decreasing everywhere on the globe outside the tropics,'' said the Illinois researcher, Kenneth P. Bowman. ''Most of the attention has been focused on Antarctica, but there have also been substantial decreases over the Northern Hemisphere.''</p>
        <p>How much of the decline comes from uncertain natural causes and how much is from human influence on the atmosphere is a matter of intense debate. In the 1960's, ozone levels rose nearly as much as they now appear to have fallen, scientists now estimate. Nevertheless, many atmospheric scientists call the fast global loss of ozone deeply disturbing.</p>
        <p>The new findings come as the Federal Environmental Protection Agency prepares to enforce an international protocol, reached recently in Montreal, limiting the expanding use of chlorofluorocarbons, which break down ozone when they diffuse into the upper atmosphere. Public hearings on the proposed rules begin next week.</p>
        <p>Some environmental experts said that, if the 1980's have already brought a 5 percent decline in the ozone, the Montreal negotiators based their accord on too hopeful a starting point.</p>
        <p>''The composition of the atmosphere may be changing far more rapidly than we had expected, and perhaps more rapidly than we can react to,'' said Irving M. Mintzer, head of the climate program of the World Resources Institute in Washington. ''Clearly the Montreal protocol is not enough to reduce the risk.'' #40% Drop Over Antarctica Because sunlight prompts a chemical reaction that bolsters ozone, the poles show the worst drops, more than 40 percent in the so-called ozone hole that appears over Antarctica in springtime. The middle latitudes, where most people live, have suffered declines of 6 percent to 7 percent since 1979, Dr. Bowman estimates.</p>
        <p>Scientists said they were bewildered by such high numbers. They do not know whether the broad swing in ozone reflects an unexplained natural variability, perhaps amplified by the manmade gases, or whether the chemical effects of the gases are even more devastating than computer models predicted.</p>
        <p>Ozone levels rose 4 percent in the 1960's, according to the imperfect ground-based observations that were available, and the decline could simply be part of an erratic long-term waxing and waning of ozone that began before there were instruments to measure it. Some scientists have speculated that such changes may be connected to the 11-year cycle of solar activity.</p>
        <p>The minuscule amounts of ozone lacing the stratosphere reflect the outcome of complex reactions that continuously destroy molecules of the gas and recreate them. Researchers assume that the final tally represents a relatively stable balance of these processes, and they are trying to understand how sensitive the balance is to perturbations like the arrival of chlorofluorocarbons.</p>
        <p>Some scientists believe the chlorine-based gases may be magnifying the natural variation. The chlorofluorocarbons added to the stratosphere so far do not seem to explain so large a decline in ozone, at least according to the relatively crude computer models used in making atmospheric predictions.</p>
        <p>''We would have predicted less than a 1 percent change due to a CFC effect,'' said Robert T. Watson, chief of upper atmospheric research for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. ''Does it mean that we have grossly underestimated the chlorofluorocarbon effect?''</p>
        <p>The answer, he said, remains unclear. The space agency has organized a large-scale international assessment of the data, to be completed in March. Dr. Watson said the final estimates might differ somewhat from Dr. Bowman's, but that his group was seeing a similarly sharp depletion of the ozone layer worldwide.</p>
        <p>Another NASA scientist, however, took sharp issue with Dr. Bowman's findings. The scientist, Robert Hudson, told The Associated Press that the real decline was probably about half of Dr. Bowman's estimate because that estimate was based on data from unreliable instruments aboard the Nimbus 7 satellite. But Dr. Bowman asserts that he has taken possible instrument inaccuracies into account.</p>
        <p>The international assessment now under way has highlighted the difficulty of glimpsing trends in data so variable and uncertain. Instruments in ground stations or on a satellite gauge the trace quantities of ozone by analyzing the spectrum of light passing through the atmosphere. Precisely calibrating such instruments is an unrelenting problem.</p>
        <p>Knowledge of older trends, going back to the late 1950's, comes from a modest network of ground-based instruments, mostly in the United States and Europe. Since 1979, two instruments aboard the Nimbus 7 satellite have provided a richer set of data, covering virtually the entire globe every day.</p>
        <p>But the satellite instruments offer one serious disadvantage: their remoteness. ''They're less reliable in the sense that we can't take the instrument back down into the laboratory and recalibrate it,'' Dr. Bowman said.</p>
        <p>Comparison with the ground-based measurements suggests to some researchers that the satellite calibration has drifted over the past eight years. Although the ground instruments do not give comprehensive global data, they provide a check on the accuracy of the satellite instruments.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bowman said his global average of 5 percent over the eight years took the drift into account. His raw data, without correcting for the presumed error, show an even sharper loss of ozone, about 1 percent each year. Awareness of Problem</p>
        <p>The first indications of a severe global depletion have been circulating among atmospheric scientists for a year. In unpublished work, a NASA researcher, Donald F. Heath, analyzed data from a second instrument aboard the Nimbus satellite and found similarly sharp declines.</p>
        <p>Dr. Heath estimated that the decline had reached 2.5 percent by 1984. Where the satellite and ground data diverge, Dr. Heath tends to trust the satellite data.</p>
        <p>As the international debate over controlling chlorofluorocarbons led toward the recent accord in Montreal, biologists have tried to estimate the number of skin cancer cases and harm to crops that will come with higher levels of ultraviolet light. Such predictions, though increasingly dire, have assumed that a 5 percent ozone loss was decades away.</p>
        <p>Estimating the global consequences of ultraviolet levels never yet seen remains highly uncertain. Scientists do not even agree on whether rising skin cancer rates are driven by large single doses or total long-term exposure.</p>
        <p>Even so, the author of one such study, Daniel J. Dudek of the Environmental Defense Fund, a New York research group, said a decline in ozone on that scale corresponded to 100,000 new cases of skin cancer each year in the United States alone, an increase of roughly one-fifth.</p>
        <p>''If we're already starting with a 5 percent decline, ''it gives us serious pause,'' he said.</p>
