        <p>Bears, Bears Everywhere</p>
        <p>Very few people have ever come nose to nose with a grizzly. But these days the experience can be had -- safely -- in the American Museum of Natural History, where the Imax movie ''Bears'' recently opened. In one of the last frames, a powerful grizzly, well, bears down on you at amazing speed, as if it were about to leap the bonds of film. You'll be glad that you weren't the cameraman.</p>

        <p>Bears, Bears Everywhere</p>
        <p>Very few people have ever come nose to nose with a grizzly. But these days the experience can be had -- safely -- in the American Museum of Natural History, where the Imax movie ''Bears'' recently opened. In one of the last frames, a powerful grizzly, well, bears down on you at amazing speed, as if it were about to leap the bonds of film. You'll be glad that you weren't the cameraman.</p>
        <p>But you will probably wish that you could be one of the hikers who accompany Chris Day on her travels. Ms. Day, a wilderness guide featured in the film, lives on grizzly territory in Alaska. In her 15 years of observing these bears, she says, she has felt many emotions, but never fear. The grizzlies allow her to come close, treating her with a serene indifference. Although widely portrayed as bloodthirsty, grizzlies, the film notes, are ''in some ways more cowlike than killer.'' Still, they are best approached with a healthy respect.</p>
        <p>But respect is just what bears are unlikely to receive. Although revered as kindred spirits by American Indian tribes, bears tend to suffer today from human predation and encroachment. Polar bears, the filmmakers point out, are among the first creatures to be harmed by global warming. Dependent on ice floes for hunting, they are losing turf and time as winters grow shorter.</p>
        <p>Despite this sober message, the film, produced by the National Wildlife Federation, includes many light moments. Black bear cubs gambol in the grass, making honking noises that sound hilariously like geese. Polar bears do ''strange tangos on the tundra.'' And when the salmon spawn, grizzlies congregate at a river, jostling for position like unruly relatives at a family picnic.</p>
        <p>Ms. Day says she wants to turn the people she meets into ''ambassadors for the bears.'' This film, directed by David Lickley, will probably earn her many new recruits.</p>
        <p>''Bears,'' at the Imax theater, American Museum of Natural History, Central Park West and 79th Street. Screenings: Daily at 11:25 a.m. and 1:20 and 4:15 p.m.; also at 6 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays. Tickets (includes museum admission): $15; students and 65+, $11; ages 2 to 12, $9; under 2, free. Reservations: (212) 769-5200.</p>
        <p>New Voices</p>
        <p>When the children in No Limits Theater Group conclude their performances this weekend, most will hear only faint applause. This is not a comment on their talent but a reflection of a problem they all live with: profound hearing loss.</p>
        <p>Founded in 1996 by Michelle Christie, a teacher for the deaf, No Limits aims to teach language to deaf children in a situation that even hearing ones find challenging: onstage. The children's dramatic skills also give them confidence in school, where most attend regular classes, aided by lip-reading and hearing devices.</p>
        <p>This weekend a local branch of No Limits will present a play on a theme its members know well: overcoming obstacles. Called ''Building Blocks,'' the play centers on Joey, who has just failed to make his school's basketball team. He turns on the television, where he encounters a variety of characters, from a tortoise and a hare (acting the familiar fable) to a singing dog, a classical pianist, a struggling artist and the world's first female heavyweight champion. They illustrate the principles he needs to succeed, like confidence, commitment and perseverance.</p>
        <p>All these lessons come with a healthy dose of humor. ''There's a soap opera scene where the kids are very dramatic about eating M&amp;M's,'' Ms. Christie said. ''It's overplayed and a lot of fun. Joey also gets pulled into the TV to do 'The Joey Letterman Show.' ''</p>
        <p>Although hearing children sometimes have trouble understanding deaf children's speech, ''the play is done with safety nets for that,'' she added. The theatergoers will be involved, too. ''The performance is also to teach the public about what the group can do,'' Ms. Christie said. ''There are no limits for these kids if you give them an opportunity.''</p>
        <p>''Building Blocks,'' tomorrow and Sunday at 2 and 4 p.m. at the Neighborhood Playhouse, 340 East 54th Street, Manhattan. Tickets: $20 in advance; $25 at the door. Reservations: (917) 734-1831.</p>
        <p>Ever Adaptable</p>
        <p>Most New Yorkers wouldn't make a trip to see a cockroach. Why bother, when all too often one can be found close to home? But the roach that is to be in Madison Square Park tomorrow is exotic: it's from Madagascar, and it hisses. It will also be accompanied by a ball python and species that probably rate higher on the human scale of aesthetics: an owl, a hawk and a chinchilla.</p>
        <p>This varied crew will take part in the park's final Nature Saturday, a presentation by the City Parks Foundation and the Theodore Roosevelt Sanctuary. Called ''Animal Adaptations,'' the program will show how these creatures' characteristics help them survive.</p>
        <p>''The chinchilla has a thick, furry coat to keep him warm in the Andes Mountains,'' said Amy Lawbach, the park's director of children's programming. ''He uses his tail as a scarf, wrapping it around his face.'' Like many children, the chinchilla also avoids baths, preserving its fur as insulation.</p>
        <p>The program will include role-playing games about adaptation. Although children can't touch the animals, they will see them up close -- or at least at hissing distance.</p>
        <p>''Animal Adaptations,'' tomorrow  at 11 a.m. in Madison Square Park, 23rd Street and Madison Avenue, Manhattan. Free. Information: (212) 360-8170.</p>
