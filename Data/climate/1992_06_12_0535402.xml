        <p>Is President Bush an environmental pariah doing his best to scuttle important treaties at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro? Or is he the only world leader with the courage to stand firm against a flood tide of environmental extremism?</p>
        <p>The answer is, a little of both. On specific issues, like global warming, biodiversity and forest preservation, the Bush Administration has taken reasonable, even principled, positions. But in its overall approach to this conference the White House has shown little zeal for protecting the global environment and little desire to compromise for the greater good.</p>

        <p>Is President Bush an environmental pariah doing his best to scuttle important treaties at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro? Or is he the only world leader with the courage to stand firm against a flood tide of environmental extremism?</p>
        <p>The answer is, a little of both. On specific issues, like global warming, biodiversity and forest preservation, the Bush Administration has taken reasonable, even principled, positions. But in its overall approach to this conference the White House has shown little zeal for protecting the global environment and little desire to compromise for the greater good.</p>
        <p>Rather than find ways around sticking points in proposed treaties, the Administration has sought political advantage by posturing against "extremes" in the environmental movement.</p>
        <p>Today, when Mr. Bush addresses the conference, he will have a final chance to salvage the nation's reputation as an environmental leader. If he is wise he will make it clear that the United States is ready to join the rest of the industrialized world in fighting for global conservation.</p>
        <p>The signs for a late conversion are not good. On the eve of Mr. Bush's departure, his aides seemed eager to milk the President's isolation at Rio for domestic political advantage, arguing that a tough stance would please development interests and workers concerned about losing jobs because of environmental regulations.</p>
        <p>The global warming treaty, the only one Mr. Bush will sign at the summit meeting, illustrates both the strength and weakness of the Administration's intransigence. Almost singlehandedly, the U.S. forced other industrial nations to abandon a firm commitment to stabilize the emission of greenhouse gases at 1990 levels by the year 2000. Instead the treaty requires nations to institute programs to reduce emissions.</p>
        <p>This is a rational approach that avoids the danger of crippling economic growth to meet an arbitrary target. Even if the U.S. could hit the target in the year 2000, it might have great difficult stabilizing at that level thereafter. Better to make a good-faith effort to curb emissions than to adopt an unreachable goal.</p>
        <p>But the Administration's good faith was called into question when it leaned on small European countries to drop a non-binding statement criticizing the treaty and calling for stronger action. Worse yet, the Administration's own plan for curbing emissions is far too weak, avoiding the most potent weapon available, a carbon tax.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush will almost certainly not sign the other major treaty, designed to protect biodiversity. Again, he has reasonable objections. The treaty has troublesome clauses that seem to threaten patents and intellectual property rights, valuable principles that the U.S. has fought hard to protect for many years. Other clauses would set up a financing mechanism that could give far too much power to receiving countries, leaving donor countries little leverage to prevent waste.</p>
        <p>But the treaty is riddled with escape hatches that call for action when appropriate or mutually agreed upon. European nations seem willing to sign and then issue separate statements interpreting troublesome clauses. But instead of going the extra mile to protect global resources, the Administration finds fearsome risks everywhere.</p>
        <p>It may be too late to make substantive changes in the U.S. position. But it's not too late for Mr. Bush to pledge greater efforts to preserve biodiversity and additional financial contributions toward global environmental protection.</p>
