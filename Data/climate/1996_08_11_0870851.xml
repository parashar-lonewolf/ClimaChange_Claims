        <p>THE ultimate New York Web site has arrived: www.pastrami.com.</p>
        <p>No, it is not an interactive sandwich on rye. It is the Internet address of the Mill Basin Kosher Deli and Fine Art Gallery in Brooklyn, where kasha varnishkes and sour pickles are served in a dining room adorned with Ertes, James Rizzis and Alphonse Muchas. These days, it is harder to imagine that mixture of high art and haute heartburn than it is a kosher deli on the World Wide Web.</p>
        <p>The New York on-line world is exploding. Just two years ago, there was no more than a skeletal presence of sites about New York City on the Internet. Since then, growth has been phenomenal. The skeleton has filled out into a powerful, limber body that can take you almost anywhere you want to go, even to a kosher deli that sells Art Deco posters. This year, New York surpassed San Francisco as the fastest-growing city on the Internet measured by the number of new commercial domains, according to Internet Info in Falls Church, Va.</p>
        <p>''Everybody and his brother's wife's uncle is on the Internet,'' said Clay Irving, 39, who provides software and Internet services to the garment industry. (The Garment Center site, www.apparel.net, is in appropriately easy E-mail takeout range of www.pastrami.com.) In his personal Web domain, Mr. Irving offers New York City Reference, a guide to New York City-related Internet sites.</p>
        <p>''When I started keeping it, there were 12 sites about New York City, no matter how hard you looked,'' Mr. Irving said. ''I've steadily been adding to this thing. It's grown to a few thousand links, in 40 or so categories. Slowly but surely, over the years, I'm dumping the entire contents of my head onto the Web.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Irving is not alone.</p>
        <p>Joseph Brennan, 45, works in academic information systems at Columbia University, dealing with the school's E-mail system and Web pages. But from his own home page, Internet browsers can explore Mr. Brennan's other obsessions: railroads, subways and the Beatles. Mr. Brennan's grand achievement has been to list and describe in detail dozens of ''disused or unused underground railway stations of the New York area,'' essentially abandoned subway stations.</p>
        <p>''I get a lot of response on that page,'' Mr. Brennan said over the telephone. ''I'm kind of surprised myself that people are so interested in that one topic.''</p>
        <p>Unlike Mr. Irving and Mr. Brennan, whose site is decorated with his 7-year-old daughter Megan's crayon drawings, Guy Garcia, John Borthwick and their partners are seeking the big time. They run Total New York, a hip, witty and rapidly expanding on-line 'zine with a hypertext table of contents. A click of the mouse can take you to extensive and opinionated arts-and-entertainment listings; interviews with writers and artists like Carlos Fuentes and Sting; interactive entertainment like Total Cosmic Cavern, an animated chat room, and a ''cyber-station'' that broadcasts local events to a global on-line audience.</p>
        <p>''I expected this to be a huge opportunity, but it's been beyond all expectations,'' said Mr. Borthwick, Total's 30-year-old president. ''It's like kudzu. It's just unbelievable.''</p>
        <p>Now, the partners practically lick their chops as they speak of merging with any number of media companies and setting up a network of ''city-specific'' Web sites around the country.</p>
        <p>''It's a very exciting time and also a pivotal moment,'' Mr. Garcia, Total's editor and content director, said. ''We're talking to a number of very large media entities, all of which are interested in doing business with us.''</p>
        <p>This talk of the Web's rosy commercial potential, says Douglas Rushkoff, an author who has chronicled the Internet culture, is something he finds ''deeply, deeply nauseating.'' Mr. Rushkoff says that what he values most on the Internet is the interactivity, the real communication among individuals, something that he says doesn't appeal to the New York business world.</p>
        <p>As the Internet began to grow in the late 1980's, Mr. Rushkoff said, the city's corporate culture was resolutely anti-Internet, one of the last in the country to admit that the new medium held some promise.</p>
        <p>''For years I was literally laughed out of the room at cocktail parties, when I told people they would be using E-mail,'' he said. ''It was bizarre how resistant the East Coast was.''</p>
        <p>Then in the early 1990's came the development of the World Wide Web, which he said transformed the attitude of New York's business world. Unlike older parts of the Internet, which were made up mostly of text and required users to memorize arcane commands, the Web added beautiful graphics and allowed users to sail through the Internet simply by pointing and clicking with the mouse.</p>
        <p>It also brought visions of the Internet as a way to make a buck. Now, Mr. Rushkoff, who considers it a business necessity to maintain his own home page, would just as soon turn his back on the Web.</p>
        <p>''I'm really sick to death of it all,'' he said.</p>
        <p>THE WEB PEOPLE</p>
        <p>But tell that to Xander Mellish, 28, a municipal bond writer for Telerate, who publishes her own short stories and cartoons on her Web site. Or to Sabrina Liao, 27, a research scientist at New York University's Center for Advanced Technology, whose Web site offers stories about her experiences as a Taiwanese in New York, and includes sections on Chinese astrology, tips on hunting for apartments in New York, and, inevitably, pictures of Ms. Liao, her friends and family.</p>
        <p>''The Web is for people who express themselves, and New York is nothing but people with something to say,'' said Stacy Horn, the founder of Echo, an on-line bulletin board in New York. ''It's a narcissistic paradise.''</p>
        <p>And then there is Mark Schachner, the owner of Mill Basin Deli and A.J. Fine Arts, who recognized an unusual business opportunity to sell art and cold cuts all over the country through the Internet. By dialing up his site, not only can you examine his collection of Erte prints, but you can also inspect his stuffed cabbage.</p>
        <p>''It's been quite interesting,'' he said. ''I've already made some international art sales and nationwide deli sales. We actually catered a Super Bowl party in California last year. The only problem is the cost of shipping costs more than the food itself.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schachner has been spending so much time working on his Internet site that he also has a problem at home. ''My wife wants to throw me out of the house,'' he said,  ''because I sit at my computer from 8 at night to 1 in the morning.''</p>
        <p>Such hours would make Mr. Schachner feel right at home on Echo, a sort of virtual salon in which members gather by way of their computers -- frequently after 11 P.M. -- to discuss such topics as books, food, writing and the media. Participants include luminaries like M.G. Lord, the author, who leads the books discussion group, and Jesse Sheidlower, the dictionary editor, whose forum focuses on words and usage.</p>
        <p>Strictly speaking, six-year-old Echo is a computer bulletin board. The roughly 3,500 members, 80 percent of whom are New Yorkers, pay a fee to belong and must memorize commands to navigate its primitive, pre-Web, text-based shores. But that hasn't discouraged its members, who value its on-line discourse, which ranges from media gossip to ''If I Were a Meat, What Meat Would I Be?''</p>
        <p>''I'm a media junkie, and I missed the media discussion,'' said Mary Huhn, an editor with Rolling Stone Online who joined Echo several years ago, left, and returned this month. ''Even though it's not as easy a format as the Web, I just find the discussions more interesting, and because it's a local New York audience for the most part, it's more relative to me.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Horn of Echo, who likens the service to a ''small town in cyberspace,'' is hoping to add a point-and-click program for Echo so that potential members will not be scared off. And Echo now has its own Web site, which it uses to give people a sample of what happens on the bulletin board, as well as an excellent list of Internet sites related to New York City.</p>
        <p>Echo's list of sites, or ''links'' in Web jargon, is characteristic of almost all Web pages. Not only are the people who empty their heads onto the Internet desperate to express themselves, they are eager to share what they have found. Cruising from one site to another offers a ''Six Degrees of Separation'' sort of experience, in which you find that you can get just about anywhere within six jumps.</p>
        <p>In the spirit of the World Wide Web, then, here are some cool links to interesting sites that epitomize New York City. Remember, they are just starting points.</p>
        <p>NEW YORK CITY REFERENCE</p>
        <p>A master list of anything about the city, from where to find gargoyles to where to buy wine. It includes necessities like weather forecasts and a schedule of all street fairs. An essential reference area, put together by Clay Irving and accessible through Mr. Irving's home page.</p>
        <p>METROBEAT</p>
        <p>A huge, intricately linked listing of daily events, ranging from readings for children in the public libraries to Shakespeare in the Park, presented with pithy, occasionally acerbic comments. Take this description of a recent Mets-Pirates game at Shea Stadium: ''The only thrill in a game played by these two hapless teams will be watching drunken Long Islanders attempting to do the Macarena in the mezzanine during the seventh-inning stretch.''</p>
        <p>If you still want to go to Shea, you can click on a map for directions.</p>
        <p>Or, under the concert listing, this description of the band Idaho: ''Idaho makes sad pop for college kids.''</p>
        <p>Restaurant reviews are a disappointment because unlike the other listings, they are based on comments from users. So far, few have commented.</p>
        <p>NEW YORK WEB</p>
        <p>A jaded Downtown vision of the city with heavy doses of fashion, style and irony, as in this bit of advice from ''The Social Climber's Guide to Manhattan'': ''If tall/gorgeous/slim is not a reasonable visual for you, emanate a foreign and exotic aura complete with indeterminable accent. When people say where are you from say, 'I was born here but I was raised in Saudi Arabia, Ireland and Trinidad,' and then they'll go, 'Oh, so that's where you get that international accent from.' ''</p>
        <p>Lists of what's in and what's out, and clothing recommendations like this for the Sabotage line of clothing:</p>
        <p>''Engaging some of the most brilliant marketing and packaging we have ever witnessed, this genius sportswear line coming out of Germany is the quintessential must-wear label for the young techno-terrorist. Revolutionary in their approach, Sabotage creates clothing for the day when the ozone layer is gone and strange viral mutations inspire us to approach our wardrobe from the 'maximum protection' standpoint. Can't wait to see what hip-hop culture is going to do with these raiments for an endangered species.''</p>
        <p>ABANDONED SUBWAY STATIONS</p>
        <p>Available through Joseph Brennan's home page, this is a fascinating look at the dozens of areas beneath the city that are closed off to almost everyone but graffiti artists. Includes a complete history and description of each site, along with the best places to glimpse each station. Part of the description of the City Hall station:</p>
        <p>''When it was time to make all local stations 10 cars long, and to do something about closing the gaps between the sharply curved platform and train doors of the new generation of subway cars, City Hall lost. Not many passengers used the station anyway, and the engineering problems posed here would have been very expensive to correct. The Brooklyn Bridge station is a train-length away.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brennan's text-only site includes an essential link to New York City Subway Resources, with a striking set of color pictures taken in the abandoned stations and an astoundingly detailed history of the city's subway, its various cars, maps and related regional transit topics.</p>
        <p>NEW YORK CITY BEER GUIDE</p>
        <p>Get lost in suds. An opinionated listing of the best places to buy and drink beer, including bars, restaurants and retail outlets. It also has beer lists from bars, ratings of beers available at brewpubs, reference material and listings of tastings. One of Clay Irving's pages. Updated monthly.</p>
        <p>OFFICIAL CITY OF NEW YORK WEB SITE</p>
        <p>Opens with a color photo of the lower Manhattan skyline, taken by Mayor Giuliani, who either exhibits an unknown talent or confirms his reputation as one who does not like to delegate. The site is full of photos of local officials grinning, shaking hands and offering mission statements and proclamations. But there is also a useful guide to city services and agencies, and a link to the Police Department's home page (Finest Net), which includes posters of the most wanted New York City fugitives.</p>
        <p>CAFE LOS NEGROES</p>
        <p>Bills itself as the Net's black and Latino hangout, and includes features on sports, photography, poetry, fashion, dance and the arts, as well as links to other sites of interest.</p>
        <p>SABRINA LIAO'S WORLD -- WHEN EAST MEETS WEST</p>
        <p>''The whole idea is to share about my experience,'' said Sabrina Liao, 27, who teaches courses in Web technology and multimedia at New York University. ''I've been living in two worlds, and I want to share that.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Liao's very personal page deals both with her experiences as a newcomer to New York -- finding an apartment, exploring the city -- and with cultural issues like Chinese astrology. She also has extensive links to Chinese and Taiwanese sites as well as to New York real-estate brokers, who have started listing apartments on line.</p>
        <p>TOUR CENTRAL PARK</p>
        <p>Visit the park's landmarks, like the Dairy. Click and a photograph and a short description of the site appears, along with a compass intended to situate the landmark within the park. Learn that the Dairy is south of the Mall, north of Wollman Rink, east of Chess House and west of . . . nothing? Seems like a metaphysical judgment. Despite what the site says, something is east of the Dairy.</p>
        <p>HOUSE OF DIABOLIQUE</p>
        <p>Diabolique, also known as Derrick Michael, is a would-be actor and model most comfortable in drag. His site is devoted to, well, to himself, to house music, and to his Hall of Honorary Members, including Bea Arthur, Margot Kidder and Dolly Parton.</p>
        <p>''Here you will find some of my favorite photos -- all of them of me!'' Diabolique writes. ''Some pictures have bigger descriptions than others, but all contain the elusive beauty known as . . . Diabolique.''</p>
        <p>''I started it to see if it would help me be famous,'' Diabolique said by telephone. ''So far, I've gotten a lot of mail from people who want to have sex with me. I basically ignore those.''</p>
        <p>QUEENSBORO BALLADS</p>
        <p>World weary, iconoclastic but essentially optimistic fiction in the form of a folk-rock album by Levi Asher, a computer programmer who lives in Queens with his family. (Naturally, you can see pictures of his children on his Web site.) He loves the Grateful Dead, the Beats and Herman Melville.</p>
        <p>RED LIGHT CAMERAS</p>
        <p>City traffic officials have placed cameras at selected intersections to photograph cars running red lights. What nerve! Shreyas Shah, an Indian-American paramedic, has compiled an unofficial list of the intersections. You can also browse through material relating to India and read about Mr. Shah's recent trip to Italy. And remember, obey those traffic rules.</p>
        <p>JESSE'S WORD OF THE DAY</p>
        <p>For the linguists and otherwise word-obsessed. Jesse Sheidlower, a dictionary editor for Random House, is frequently sighted on line, leading a discussion group for Echo and contributing to the New York City Beer Guide. Each day, he traces the etymology of a word or phrase, like ''hoist on one's own petard'' or ''grody.'' Extra redeeming feature: Mr. Sheidlower is not bound by the strictures of conventional taste.</p>
        <p>LOSER'S GUIDE TO NEW YORK</p>
        <p>A meta-ironic tour through the East Village: ''On planet Loser everyone is named Herman. Hermans from Loser come to Earth seeking food, beer and cordless toasters. Their only resource: a sacred map passed on by previous Losers.''</p>
        <p>ECHO</p>
        <p>Echo bills itself accurately as ''the Virtual Salon of New York City,'' because people join Echo to talk. The conversations take place not on the Web, but on an on-line bulletin board that requires a monthly fee ranging from $20 to $35. Echo does have a Web site, largely to advertise what the service has to offer.</p>
        <p>The bulletin board, founded before point-and-click became the standard, looks primitive, but offers the sort of interactivity that initially attracted many to the Internet.</p>
        <p>As Ms. Horn, Echo's founder, says, ''These are people who are absolutely desperate to find somebody else who feels the same way about their obsessions.''</p>
        <p>Passion, Ideals And a Day Job</p>
        <p>XANDER MELLISH is that New York exception: an unneurotic writer. She is not bitter, not cynical, and she does not want to give up her day job, writing about municipal bonds for an electronic wire service. She is passionate and idealistic about her short stories, and says she does not write them for money. Instead, she posts them on her Web site, Xander Mellish Short Stories and Cartoons.</p>
        <p>For Ms. Mellish, 28, the Web is an extension, on an international scale, of what she has done for much of her writing life. She began by posting the first pages of her short stories on telephone poles or in restaurants. People who wanted to continue reading the stories were given a phone number for ordering the rest, free.</p>
        <p>''I love the stories,'' she said in her spare Greenwich Village walk-up . ''I wanted people to read them, I wanted to give them away, and I don't see why serious art requires somebody to pay money to read it. That's the thing that's so amazing about being on the Web. For years writers have always needed to go through a middleman to get to their audience. They beg a publisher to publish them. That's over! I go straight to the audience, and that's really liberating. It's like punk rock for writers.''</p>
        <p>Her stories are peopled by characters found only in New York, like the East Village rock-and-roller who supports himself as a bike messenger, cooking ramen noodles in a coffee pot as he dreams of making it big. ''People ask me what they're about,'' Ms. Mellish said. ''I say they're about young people with big dreams who have no idea how they're going to accomplish them.''</p>
        <p>Through her Web site software, Ms. Mellish can track not only how many people visit her site -- 1,000 or so a week, she says -- but which of her stories they read, and how far in each story they get. She is not above revising a story if she notices readers disappearing.</p>
        <p>Acknowledging that the conventional mass market for short stories has dried up, she suggests that the Internet may offer a solution. ''Maybe the reason modern short stories are so solipsistic is that the audience is so circumscribed, by small literary magazines, which are pretty much just read by other writers,'' she said. ''Maybe the Internet, by bringing short stories to a big audience again, might breathe some life into the form.''</p>
        <p>In any case, she's found her medium: ''It's such a brilliant time to be a writer! I don't care if I'm ever published in a book. Why would I ever want to do that?''</p>
        <p>ERIC ASIMOV</p>
        <p>Content's Fine. But Profits?</p>
        <p>AT Total New York's headquarters in a sixth-floor loft on West 22d Street, expectations are as quietly omnipresent as the constant muffled tapping from the computer keyboards on every desk. While no one has shown that the Internet can be a money-making medium, Total New York hopes to be the prototype of a successful Web vehicle, spawning similar sites in cities across the country.</p>
        <p>Judged strictly by its comprehensive content, Total New York is already a success. Its offerings include extensive arts and entertainment listings, with or without attitude; interviews with people like Spalding Gray and the graphic designer David Carson; ''A New Yorker Abroad,'' a monthly column by Michael Gross; ''Spanker,'' an intentionally obnoxious tour through some of the Web's more embarrassing home pages; Union</p>
