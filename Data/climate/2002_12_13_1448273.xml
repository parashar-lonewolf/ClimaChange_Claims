      <abstract>
        <p>Science journal reports that flow of major rivers into Arctic Ocean has increased 7 percent since 1936; rise in river water contribution reduces salt content, which appears to be linked to changes in atmospheric pressure; continued increases in flow of rivers and consequent changing ocean currents could impact Western European weather patterns and keep warmer air from moving north; map (S)</p>

        <p>The total flow of the six largest rivers draining from Eurasia into the Arctic Ocean has increased by 7 percent since 1936, scientists are reporting today in the journal Science. The trend appears linked to a long-term shift in atmospheric pressure and winds around the North Pole and could also be related to global warming, the researchers said. Should the rivers' flow continue to rise through the century, the reduced Arctic salinity could hinder ocean currents that carry warmth north to temper the climate in Western Europe, they said.</p>
