        <p>Soon the turn of the millennium will come and go, and historians of technology will look back at the year 2000 computer problem -- the Y2K ''crisis,'' as this newspaper and many others now call it. They will draw from it a salutary lesson: we are a silly species, easily confused and given to sudden fits of hysteria.</p>
        <p>At least we know how to make the most of a panic attack. Here's the latest issue of Wallpaper, a British high-style magazine, advising readers on how to ''bunker down'' for the coming apocalypse -- with flashlights and gold bars and bottled water and, for self-defense, a stylish black crossbow. And why not? Supposedly careful authorities have raised the specter of power failures, plane crashes, food shortages, bank runs -- the computerized wheels of commerce all grinding to a halt as the clock strikes 12 on Jan. 1, 2000. In sober preparation for the Y2K crisis, the Government of the United States has created more committees, action weeks, budget reports, Presidential councils and orders, Congressional acts and, of course, Web pages than it has for AIDS and global warming combined -- to name two crises that actually do kill people and threaten the health of the planet.</p>

        <p>Soon the turn of the millennium will come and go, and historians of technology will look back at the year 2000 computer problem -- the Y2K ''crisis,'' as this newspaper and many others now call it. They will draw from it a salutary lesson: we are a silly species, easily confused and given to sudden fits of hysteria.</p>
        <p>At least we know how to make the most of a panic attack. Here's the latest issue of Wallpaper, a British high-style magazine, advising readers on how to ''bunker down'' for the coming apocalypse -- with flashlights and gold bars and bottled water and, for self-defense, a stylish black crossbow. And why not? Supposedly careful authorities have raised the specter of power failures, plane crashes, food shortages, bank runs -- the computerized wheels of commerce all grinding to a halt as the clock strikes 12 on Jan. 1, 2000. In sober preparation for the Y2K crisis, the Government of the United States has created more committees, action weeks, budget reports, Presidential councils and orders, Congressional acts and, of course, Web pages than it has for AIDS and global warming combined -- to name two crises that actually do kill people and threaten the health of the planet.</p>
        <p>As for us in the news media, suffice to say that we've gone mad -- newsmagazine cover stories, special investigations, the works. We have been co-conspirators of an army of people with a vested interested in seeing money spent on the problem: consultants, hardware manufacturers, corporate and government information-technology managers, plaintiffs' lawyers and more. A confession: the first New York Times account of the year 2000 problem appeared in this column, back in June 1996. I'm sorry.</p>
        <p>The amount of time that you, a dutiful citizen of the modern world, should spend worrying about Y2K is zero. But if you care to devote three more minutes, you might consider the following:</p>
        <p>Software has bugs. Already. Lots of bugs. My personal computer running Microsoft Windows crashes several times a week. Bugs have shut down telephone networks for hours, fouled up bills to millions of people and caused at least one rocket to explode on takeoff. A mantra of customer service is, ''Sorry, our computers are down.'' Somehow, dependent though we are on these finical machines, we muddle on.</p>
        <p>There are lots of doomsdays. People focus on 1/1/2000. But computers have had to deal with the year 2000 for quite a while now. You probably already have a credit card with an expiration date of 00. Date arithmetic has always been arbitrary and flawed; all kinds of dates can cause trouble(9/9/99 is coming soon). Many doomsayers predicted trouble for 1/1/99, and technology reporters around the globe were on the lookout . . . and sure enough. . . .</p>
        <p>Redefining ''news.'' Some hot items that would not have been headline grabbers a year ago: meters on 300 taxis in Singapore failed for hours beginning at noon on Jan. 1; tragically, many riders were undercharged. In Sweden, drivers could not use credit cards at 600 gas stations because of a Y2K-like bug. And in hospitals, thousands of heart defibrillators made by Hewlett-Packard stopped displaying the correct date and time. They did continue to defibrillate, but doctors needing the time were forced to consult their watches.</p>
        <p>The new McCarthyism. Virtually every computer-related company now shows off a ''Year 2000 Compliance'' statement, in accordance with the Year 2000 Readiness and Disclosure Act, a new law that, to oversimplify just slightly, requires everyone to swear that they take the issue very seriously. In turn, companies require their suppliers and contractors to prove that they, too, are Y2K-compliant. The Securities and Exchange Commission has mandated reporting and disclosure and testing and contingency planning by broker-dealers and investment advisers and public companies and more.</p>
        <p>The thing is, it's hard to prove, but almost everyone and everything is Y2K-compliant already. Sure, your car is riddled with computer chips, but they don't know or care what day it is. Personal computers really have no year 2000 problems worth mentioning -- and if you don't believe me, you can check right now by resetting your system date to 1/1/00.</p>
        <p>But no one can afford to look complacent. Even Microsoft has bent in the wind, feeling compelled to create the Microsoft Direct Access Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure and Resource Center -- which notes shrewdly, ''Helping your customers solve their year 2000 problems can mean revenue for you.''</p>
        <p>This prophecy is self-fulfilling. One alarming feature of the early year 2000 warnings was that it would cost fantastic sums. This has already come true -- never mind that much of the money has gone to the people sounding the alarm in the first place. That's not a disaster. Companies need to replace outdated computer software anyway, and the economy will somehow accommodate all the programmers who can now afford to fly first class. The one genuine risk confronting the world now is that people will take seriously the terrifying millennial forecasts and get even more panicky than they are: hoard cash and groceries, sell all their stocks and arm themselves with crossbows or worse.</p>
        <p>Look. We humans always fret about the end of the world when the calendar reaches a big round number. We're already anxious about computers, and rightly so: they're increasingly important, increasingly smart, increasingly interconnected and almost as unreliable as ever. We live in a tightly knit world, where a failure in one place can have bad consequences far, far away. All this is true and, at the end of this year, some computers will have problems with their dates. But dawn will break on Sunday, Jan. 1, and the Western calendar will turn to the year 2000 C.E., and the sky will not fall.</p>
        <p>FAST FORWARD  Correction:  February 7, 1999, Sunday  The Fast Forward column on Jan. 24, about the year 2000 computer problem, misstated the day of the week on which Jan. 1, 2000, will fall. It is Saturday, not Sunday.</p>
