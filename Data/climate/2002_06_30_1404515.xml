        <p>Landscapes, no less than people, are transformed by the eyes that behold them. When an environmentalist travels the Jack Morrow Hills, in Wyoming's Red Desert, he sees a near-perfect ecosystem of soaring buttes, badlands and shifting sand dunes, while desert elk and pronghorn antelope hoof across the sands, pausing to drink from tiny ponds formed when the winter snows melt between the dunes. At 600,000 acres, the Jack Morrow Hills are part of this country's largest untouched high-elevation desert, indeed one of the largest roadless areas of any kind in the U.S. -- what Mac Blewer of the Wyoming Outdoor Council likes to call ''the wild heart of the West.'' When an energy developer treads that same path, however, he often sees with a kind of seismic vision, sensing beneath those same geologic sands a portion of the approximately 137 trillion cubic feet of natural gas that is believed to lie within the Rocky Mountain region.</p>

From New Mexico to the Canadian border, scores of new drilling sites are being proposed. (In Wyoming's Powder River Basin alone, the Department of the Interior is hoping to lease up to 50,000 new well sites, a move that would nearly double all active oil and gas wells on American public lands.) Unlike the fight over the Arctic refuge, an iconic place in the midst of a national debate, the Rocky Mountain energy battles will be fought in some cases in little-known places across a diffuse geographic area. And while the refuge had Congressional protection, only regulatory changes by the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management would be needed for industry to gain a greater foothold across much of the American West.

        <p>Now that the Bush administration's efforts to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska have been defeated in the Senate, the Bush-Cheney energy team is shifting its focus to the Rocky Mountain West. From New Mexico to the Canadian border, scores of new drilling sites are being proposed. (In Wyoming's Powder River Basin alone, the Department of the Interior is hoping to lease up to 50,000 new well sites, a move that would nearly double all active oil and gas wells on American public lands.) Unlike the fight over the Arctic refuge, an iconic place in the midst of a national debate, the Rocky Mountain energy battles will be fought in some cases in little-known places across a diffuse geographic area. And while the refuge had Congressional protection, only regulatory changes by the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management would be needed for industry to gain a greater foothold across much of the American West. But just as it did when the White House proposed drilling for oil in America's most pristine wildlife refuge, the country will once again be faced with a choice over how to use some of its most mineral-rich lands -- places that are all the more threatened because of their beautiful anonymity.</p>
        <p>When the Bush administration unveiled its energy task force plan last year, its central argument was that fossil-fuel development and environmental stewardship were not mutually exclusive. In the Arctic refuge, it was argued, the 70's-era technology that turned swaths of Alaska's North Slope into a seething industrial zone was a thing of the past; ice roads, as well as high-tech drilling techniques, could limit the industrial ''footprint'' of a particular drilling site to just a few acres. Likewise, concerns that drilling on the refuge's delicate coastal plain could threaten a 130,000-strong Porcupine River caribou herd were addressed with charts and graphs showing that in the more than 30 years since oil was first discovered in Prudhoe Bay, caribou populations had soared; oil was ''caribou viagra,'' according to lobbyists, who handed out photos of massive, full-antlered bulls grazing contentedly in the shadow of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline.</p>
        <p>To those and other statements, environmentalists suggested that industry put its money where its mouth was. Robert Costanza, one of a growing number of ''ecological economists,'' proposed the idea that if oil companies wanted to drill in environmentally sensitive areas, they should be required to post an assurance bond, just as a building contractor often does, large enough to cover the ''worst-case damages from their activity.'' If indeed the industrial footprint was going to be so small, he argued, how could an oil company object to posting a refundable bond to cover the cost of, say, cleaning up thousands of barrels of oil spilled across the tundra? The debate over what to do with the Jack Morrow Hills and other sites along the Great Divide Basin has generally hewed to the same terms, with energy interests promising minimal impact and environmentalists seeking to hold them to their word. (The Bureau of Land Management is scheduled to release an environmental-impact statement for the Jack Morrow Hills in September.)</p>
        <p>One of the Bush administration's main arguments is that so much American public land has been locked up by environmental regulation that its energy plan merely restores a sense of balance to the debate. But in fact, at last count, more than 90 percent of B.L.M. land in the Rocky Mountain region was potentially available to oil and gas leasing. The terms of the debate have narrowed. While the old school of conservationists used to fight for true wilderness -- land free and clear of the industrial hand of man -- today's environmental activists are largely left trying to limit industry's pervasive reach, ensuring that caribou can thrive near pipelines and desert elk can negotiate the gravel of the drilling pad. Hardly anyone poses the larger question, as Margaret Murie did in her Congressional testimony some 20 years ago on behalf of expanding the original Arctic refuge: ''Having been the basis of all our sophisticated society, doesn't wilderness itself have a right to live on?''</p>
