        <p>Frogs and toads lack the majesty of tigers, the cuddliness of pandas and the symbolic value of bald eagles. Nor are they as startlingly beautiful as, say, butterflies and orchids. Yet for 180 million years, they have been playing an important role in the broad scheme of life.</p>
        <p>Without frogs to eat them, mosquitoes would overrun valuable residential and recreational areas. Without frogs' eggs and tadpoles to eat, fish and water birds would abandon many lakes and ponds, or die of starvation.</p>
        <p>But frogs worldwide are in an accelerating decline, with some species disappearing even before scientists can document their existence. Because most species live both on land and in water, they are vulnerable to more than the usual number of threats to survival in modern times: habitat destruction, toxic chemicals, invasive species, climate change and depletion of the ozone layer, as well as the prodigious human appetite for their delicately flavored legs.</p>
        <p>Now frogs and their fellow amphibians are facing what may be an even greater threat -- attacks by emerging pathogens, especially a fungus with the daunting name Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. Dr. James P. Collins, an ecologist and evolutionary biologist at Arizona State University in Tempe, said 32 strains of the fungus had been linked to the decline and extinction of frogs and toads in North and Central America and Australia.</p>
        <p>In Costa Rica and Panama, the fungus has been associated with declining numbers of three-fourths of the frog species surveyed. Some scientists fear that the disease will reach the limited range of the Panamanian golden frog, now the focus of an international effort to prevent its extinction.</p>
        <p>In Australia, 46 species have been infected with the fungus, with 13 declining and 3 becoming extinct as a result.</p>
        <p>Dr. Collins said the fungus was the first of its kind known to kill vertebrates. It causes a skin infection and probably interferes with absorption of oxygen from water, he said.</p>
        <p>The plight is underscored in ''Frogs: A Chorus of Colors,'' on view at the American Museum of Natural History. The show includes live examples of dozens of the 3,800 species of frogs and toads currently believed to inhabit the earth. Scientists estimate that hundreds of these species are in decline and that many others have already become extinct.</p>
        <p>''It is hard to document extinction,'' said Dr. Christopher J. Raxworthy, who curated the exhibition.</p>
        <p>Scientists say that when a prevalent species remains unseen year after year in its preferred or only known habitat extinction is likely. One recently extinct species is the golden toad, found in Costa Rica. The cause of its disappearance is almost certainly climate change. Dr. J. Alan Pounds, a herpetologist who is working in the Monteverde region of Costa Rica, deduced that the cloud layer rose as the climate warmed in the highly stratified mountain ecology, forcing frog species to move up. But the golden toad already lived at the top and, with nowhere to go, simply disappeared.</p>
        <p>Other climate-related threats to frogs are exposure to ultraviolet-B radiation, which can interfere with developing tadpoles from eggs; an increase in average temperatures; increased salination, reducing the fresh water that nearly all frog species require; and drought in formerly wet areas.</p>
        <p>Adding to those are threats from human activities. As noted in the museum exhibition, tons of wild frogs are caught each day and shipped to restaurants around the world. The United States imports 1.25 million pounds of frog legs a year, with most sold in Asian markets. One species on the brink of extinction in Dominica as a result of this insatiable appetite is the smoky jungle frog, known locally as ''mountain chicken,'' a great jumper that all too often lands on dinner plates.</p>
