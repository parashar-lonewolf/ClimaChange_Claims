        <p>Life on Earth may be doomed but not for at least a billion years, two scientists suggest.</p>
        <p>This new estimate gives Earth's creatures a tenfold increase in life expectancy over a span proposed earlier. The latest estimate, by Dr. Ken Caldeira, a geochemist, and Dr. James F. Kasting, an atmospheric scientist, both of Pennsylvania State University, is based on a complex mathematical representation of interactions in the environment.</p>
        <p>For many reasons, scientists believe that life on Earth cannot survive indefinitely. For one thing, the Sun, which is a common type of star, is expected to expand into a red giant, the outer shell of which will eventually engulf the orbit of the planet Mercury and roast the Earth. The Earth would then be burned clean of life in five billion years.</p>
        <p>But many scientists believe that by that time life will have long since disappeared for other reasons.</p>
        <p>The mathematical model developed by Dr. Caldeira and Dr. Kasting, which was described in an article being published today in the British journal Nature, supports earlier predictions that the Earth may meet its doom through a precipitous decline in atmospheric carbon dioxide. That would starve plants of their main chemical building blocks and destroy the planet's food chain. Hotter, Brighter Sun</p>
        <p>The idea, proposed a decade ago by a British environmental scientist, Dr. James E. Lovelock, and his colleague, Dr. M. Whitfield, is based on the belief that as the Sun becomes more luminous, the Earth will gradually heat up. Solar heating will enable the Earth's silicate rocks to react much more readily with atmospheric carbon dioxide, thereby removing carbon dioxide from the air.</p>
        <p>Although this process would slow the greenhouse warming of the Earth, it would also rob plants of the raw material they use to photosynthesize carbohydrates. Dr. Lovelock predicted that within 100 million years the Earth would run out of food and become a lifeless planetary mausoleum.</p>
        <p>In the next phase, solar heating would eventually prevail, vaporizing the planet's water, splitting water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen and hurling the hydrogen into space. The global loss of water would then destroy the ability of silicate rocks to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and when volcanoes erupted, they would soon inject enough fresh carbon dioxide into the atmosphere to initiate a new runaway greenhouse effect. The Earth would soon resemble searing Venus, with temperatures high enough to melt many metals.</p>
        <p>Where Dr. Caldeira and Dr. Kasting part company with Dr. Lovelock is in their estimate of the rate of change in the decline of the greenhouse effect. In their model, the Penn State scientists calculate that despite the increasing heat of the Sun, the temperature of the atmosphere is likely to remain fairly constant for 900 million years because the warmed rocks will take carbon dioxide from the air and reduce the greenhouse effect. Leaner Diet for Plants</p>
        <p>Moreover, Dr. Kasting said in an interview, Dr. Lovelock overlooked another factor that could greatly prolong terrestrial life. Dr. Lovelock's assumptions were based on older forms of plant life that generally require a level of carbon dioxide in the air of at least 150 parts per million. The Lovelock model predicts that atmospheric carbon dioxide will fall to that level in 100 million years, dooming all life. But Dr. Kasting noted that another, more highly evolved class of plants, including corn and many grasses, absorb carbon dioxide in a different mode, requiring levels of less than 10 parts per million. Corn is able to get along on much leaner diets of carbon dioxide than many other plants because its cells can pressurize and thereby concentrate carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>Of course, Dr. Kasting said, various unpredictable catastrophes could snuff out terrestrial life much sooner than death by carbon dioxide starvation. Among them, he said, would be an impact with some huge extraterrestrial body, like the comet Chiron, which has a diameter of 150 miles. He discounted a suggestion by some theorists, that a nearby supernova explosion might exterminate life, because the Earth is not in a region of the galaxy where supernovas often occur.</p>
        <p>"You never know what might happen," he said. "But with any luck, and with a billion years to play with, the human race would seem to have plenty of time to solve its problems."</p>
