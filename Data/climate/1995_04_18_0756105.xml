        <p>With the 25th anniversary of Earth Day coming up, a debate is raging over just how successful the environmental movement it spawned has been.</p>
        <p>A spate of recent books and articles declare that the worst is over and a green and healthy future lies ahead. Several types of air and water pollution have been reduced, as the optimists point out, and industrial toxins are being released at a markedly lower rate.</p>
        <p>But others argue that these victories were relatively easy ones against clear and obvious threats. The real test is still to come, as the nation begins to deal with the difficult and less well defined issues of declining biodiversity and global warming.</p>
