        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Clean Air, Common Sense'' (editorial, March 6), on the Senate's clean air bill, overlooks important facts about United States air quality achievements and the utility industry's commitment to improve the air we breathe.</p>
        <p>The electric utility industry has a solid record of controlling emissions. From 1973 to 1987, electric utility dioxide emissions dropped by more than 21 percent while, at the same time, coal use soared nearly 85 percent. In addition, electric utilities have invested billions of dollars on promising, energy-efficient clean-coal technologies.</p>
        <p>The legislation that is being debated by the Senate is estimated to cost electric consumers a minimum of $17 billion annually. That's three times as expensive as the Administration's bill.</p>
        <p>The electric utility industry emits only 1 percent of the hazardous pollutants regulated by the toxics provision in the Senate legislation. For a 1 percent reduction, electricity customers will be asked to pay $7.8 billion annually, in addition to the projected $5 billion to $7 billion yearly costs for acid rain controls. Also adding to the costs of the Senate bill is the nitrogen oxide provision, estimated to cost close to $4 billion a year.</p>
        <p>The cost of these proposals will be borne by our customers. Therefore, the electric utility industry has long advocated the use of flexibility and freedom of choice to keep compliance costs at a minimum. Our customers will see increases not only in electric bills, but also in costs from all other industries affected by this legislation.</p>
        <p>We have suggested revisions that will enable us to meet the targeted emission reductions at a reduced cost burden. We think the savings are worthwhile.</p>
