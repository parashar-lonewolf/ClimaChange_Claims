        <p>STREAM OF HISTORY ''One of the most significant shifts in social studies has been toward an emphasis on local history,'' according to Roger Panetta, one of three speakers in a series of illustrated lectures about the Hudson River and its expanding place in American history. No longer a simple tale of Hendrick Hudson and his discovery of a great body of water, the river has been redefined as the location of some of America's outstanding architecture, as the inspiration for the country's first indigenous school of painting and as a benchmark of waterfront land use from residential to industrial and, lately, returning to residential.</p>
        <p>William H. Pierson Jr., professor of art emeritus of Williams College in Massachusetts, will open the series at 4 P.M. today, discussing architecture, from Dutch farmhouse to riverside manor, primarily in the 19th century. ''Media Style in the Hudson River School of Painting'' will be the subject next Sunday for Oswaldo Rodriguez Roque, associate curator of American art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The final talk, on Feb. 15, will be by Mr. Panetta, assistant professor of history at Marymount College in Tarrytown. He will speak on the development of the river and the riverfront.</p>
        <p>''The river was a microcosm of the transportation revolution of the 19th century, moving from sloops to steamers to railroads, then to highways and bridges,'' he said. ''In 1690, it was substantially wider, with an irregular shoreline. It has gradually been filled in, deepened and straightened, more like a channel than a river, with landfill property becoming valuable. Battery Park City may well become the precedent for the rest of the river.''</p>
        <p>''Artists of the Hudson River School once complained that there were no architectural ruins to paint, as there were in Europe,'' he continued. ''Today we have the ruins of abandoned industrial buildings along the shores. But a new interest in the river, enhanced by the Tall Ships and Statue of Liberty celebrations, has quickened the restoration of rundown waterfronts as residential communities and marketplaces.''</p>
        <p>The talks will take place at Philipsburg Manor auditorium, Upper Mills, Route 9, North Tarrytown. Admission is $10 for a single program, $25 for the series. Call 631-8200 for more information or reservations. PRINTS IN PELHAM</p>
        <p>An exhibition of silk-screen prints by 33 major contemporary American artists goes on display today at the Pelham Art Center at 155 Fifth Avenue until Feb. 21. Works by Willem de Kooning, Romare Bearden, Adolph Gottlieb, Jasper Johns, Alex Katz, Roy Lichtenstein, Jackson Pollock and Andy Warhol, among others, were gathered from the permanent collection of the Guild Hall Museum in East Hampton by the Gallery Association of New York State.</p>
        <p>The 15-year-old association, financed in part by the State Council on the Arts, circulates 25 to 30 exhibitions yearly among 260 cooperating nonprofit exhibition centers in libraries, community art centers and in such universities as the State University of New York at Purchase, New York University, Syracuse and Cornell Universities, Sarah Lawrence College and the College of New Rochelle. While most of the exhibitions are shown within the state, many are transported to other areas of the Northeast from Washington through New England.</p>
        <p>Viewing hours are from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesday through Friday and 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Saturday. CRYSTAL PALACES</p>
        <p>Wave Hill and the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx have unrelated programs of special interest scheduled in Manhattan. Until April 26, the Cooper-Hewitt Museum of the Smithsonian Institution at 2 East 91st Street will house an exhibition about crystal palaces. The 90-foot-high greenhouse that towers over the Botanical Garden today was a replacement built in 1899 for the original that stood in what is now Bryant Park, at Sixth Avenue between 40th and 42d Streets. It was destroyed by fire in 1858, five years after it was built.</p>
        <p>Rare photographs, drawings, prints, sheet music, illustrations, ceramics, advertising ephemera and other memorabilia from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the New-York Historical Society, the Museum of the City of New York, Library of Congress, Avery Library of Columbia University and the Smithsonian horticultural library describe the development of the American crystal palaces and their British prototype built in London to house the first World's Fair in 1851.</p>
        <p>Museum hours are from 10 A.M. to 9 P.M. Tuesday, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Wednesday through Saturday, noon to 5 P.M. Sunday. Tickets are $3, children $1.50. The phone number is (212) 860-6868. SPEAKING OF GARDENS</p>
        <p>A series of horticultural lectures at the National Academy of Design in Manhattan are scheduled by Wave Hill at 6:30 P.M. this Thursday, and on Feb. 5 and April 2. Allen Paterson, director of the Royal Botanical Gardens in Hamilton, Ontario, will talk about ''Pictures in the Garden: The Art of Plant Association'' during the first session.</p>
        <p>''The Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Garden'' in Seal Harbor, Maine, is the next topic, discussed by Paula Dietz, co-editor of The Hudson Review, the arts and literary quarterly. The final subject is ''Ornamental Grasses Rediscovered: Superb Late-Season Perennials for Today's Gardens'' by Rick Darke, curator of plants at Longwood Gardens, Kennett Square, Pa. Mr. Darke is also an expert botanical illustrator who spent almost three months of 1985 in Japan and South Africa collecting specimens for Longwood and the United States Arboretum.</p>
        <p>Admission is $8 for each lecture or $20 for the series. Call Wave Hill, (212) 549-3200 for reservations. RESEARCH PROJECTS</p>
        <p>Dr. Gene Likens, director of ecosystems studies at the New York Botanical Garden's research facility in Millbrook, N.Y., will give a one-hour talk at the Mary Flagler Arboretum in Millbrook at 2 P.M. today, open to the public free of charge. He will discuss current research projects involving studies of the Hudson River, Lyme disease, the gypsy moth and acid rain. He was one of the initiators of the Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study in New Hampshire in 1963, through which the first direct cause and effect relationship of acid rain was documented. For information and directions, call 677- 5359. RELIGIOUS OUTCASTS</p>
        <p>During a week dominated by lectures, one more, given by Dr. James F. Romano, associate curator of the Egyptian department of the Brooklyn Museum, deals with the arcane subject of religion among the ancient Egyptian poor. ''Because of their lowly station they were denied access to the temple gods and rituals,'' Dr. Romano said. ''They had to make do with substitutes they erected at great festivals. They relied heavily on oracles, since they were illiterate and could not read written prayers.''</p>
        <p>As late as the 1880's, Egyptian women worshipped an ancient statue of Bes, excavated during an archeological dig in a small town outside Cairo, in ''an underlying retention of Pharaonic tradition,'' Dr. Romano said. His talk begins at 7:15 this evening in the Scarsdale Public Library, at Post Road and Olmstead Avenue. Admission is $3.</p>
