        <p>LEAD: Down a potholed road here in the forlorn steppes of Soviet Central Asia lies a shabby cluster of concrete buildings that has loomed large in the lore of the Pentagon.</p>
        <p>Down a potholed road here in the forlorn steppes of Soviet Central Asia lies a shabby cluster of concrete buildings that has loomed large in the lore of the Pentagon.</p>
        <p>The unimposing compound houses a laser research center once billed by the United States Defense Department as the fearsome core of the Soviet anti-missile ''Star Wars'' program.</p>
        <p>Today a group of 10 Americans, including two physicists, three members of Congress and two journalists, were the first foreigners allowed inside this testing ground to view what the Soviets have always maintained was an innocent research program. Monument to Pentagon</p>
        <p>After exploring the installation from its basement electrical circuitry to its 20-year-old transisterized computers to the laser once billed by the American intelligence agency as an operable antisatellite weapon, members of the American delegation said the complex was less a menace than a monument to Pentagon public relations.</p>
        <p>''It seems to me it pretty clearly is not a power laser and doesn't represent any threat as a weapon,'' said Representative Jim Olin, Democrat of Virginia, a former electrical engineer for the General Electric Company.</p>
        <p>''If they wanted to have an antisatellite program, this research - locating and tracking objects in space - is certainly applicable,'' he added. ''But it sure doesn't look like a beam weapon.''</p>
        <p>''What it looks like is a Potemkin village built by the Pentagon,'' said S. Jacob Scherr, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a New York-based group that lobbies for disarmament and the environment. Campaign of Glasnost</p>
        <p>The tour of Sary-Shagan, a destination Western arms experts have longed to know more about, was perhaps the most remarkable development yet in a Soviet campaign of ''military glasnost,'' aimed at promoting President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's initiatives by opening some of the military's tantalizing secrets to the outside.</p>
        <p>On Friday the visiting Americans were the first outsiders to set foot in the Kyshtym nuclear complex, a closed area in the Ural Mountains where the Soviet Union has produced plutonium for its nuclear weapons since 1948. That visit was a promotion for Mr. Gorbachev's proposal to ban further production of weapons-grade plutonium.</p>
        <p>Accompanied by a cadre of American physicists, the group spent last Wednesday conducting radiation tests aboard a Soviet Navy cruiser in the Black Sea, a venture intended to demonstrate the possibility of arms control at sea.</p>
        <p>Yevgeny P. Velikhov, a vice president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and organizer of the tour, said Mr. Gorbachev personally approved the visits. #2 American Physicists The American visitors included two physicists, two members of the House Armed Services Committee and an aide to the Senate Armed Services Committee. None of the Americans were specialists in lasers, and the excursion to the laser center was arranged at the last minute, leaving no opportunity for the group to consult experts before leaving the United States.</p>
        <p>Sary-Shagan has been an object of American interest since at least 1984, when the Pentagon first published a sketch based on satellite photographs of the compound.</p>
        <p>In 1985, the Defense and State Departments - in the midst of an aggressive campaign to justify President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative - published a booklet identifying this remote spot as the heart of an ''ominous'' laser weapons research and development program.</p>
        <p>''The directed energy R &amp; D site at Sary-Shagan proving ground included ground-based lasers that could be used in an antisatellite role today and possibly a ballistic missile defense role in the future,'' the document asserted. Extra Money for Pentagon</p>
        <p>Representative John M. Spratt Jr., Democrat of South Carolina and a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said even then American intelligence experts had serious doubts about the menace of the laser center because they saw no evidence of a power large enough to produce the jolt required for laser weaponry. Mr. Spratt said they confined their doubts to classified briefings.</p>
        <p>''It's incredible to think that the Pentagon S.D.I. folks probably got an extra $10 billion because of this place,'' said Frank Von Hippel, a Princeton University physicist who toured Sary Shagan today.</p>
        <p>In the last year or so, the American Star Wars program has been scaled back and the Pentagon now describes Sary Shagan less certainly as a place where the Soviets ''are believed to be developing several lasers for strategic applications.''</p>
        <p>Defense Department interest has shifted to another reported Soviet laser installation near Dushanbe, the capital of Tadjikistan. Denial From Soviets</p>
        <p>Soviet officials here denied that lasers at Dushanbe have weapons potential, but they declined to describe the center there in detail.</p>
        <p>The officials also declined to discuss nonlaser activities at the vast proving ground here, which is the Soviet testing center for weapons designed to defend against long-range nuclear missile attacks.</p>
        <p>In their landing at a military air strip and the half-hour bus ride to the laser center, the visitors saw rows of parked fighter and transport planes, ventilated bunkers that appeared to be ammunition storage dumps, and a tall phased-array radar presumably used to coordinate anti-missile defense tests, but no evidence of other laser sites.</p>
        <p>Mr. Velikhov said the laser center was originally planned in the 1960's as a major space weapons development complex that would employ high-power lasers in an attempt to shoot ballistic missiles from space. Cavernous Concrete Shell</p>
        <p>The grimmest of the three buildings at the site is a cavernous shell of concrete and steel plate that, in those early visions, was to house a huge laser powered by chemical explosions. Mr. Velikhov said the idea was abandoned after the 1972 Soviet-American treaty limiting anti-ballistic defenses, and the site became a modest research center.</p>
        <p>Nikolai N. Shakhonsky, who was identified as the civilian head of the laser compound, described the two lasers on the site as a visible ruby laser installed in 1979, and a more powerful infrared, carbon dioxide laser added three years later.</p>
        <p>He said the lasers were fired several times a month at airplanes fitted with special detectors, to study the behavior of lasers and their ability to track objects in space.</p>
        <p>Tests aimed at a Soviet satellite -the most recent last August - proved the device was too clumsy to track objects in space, he said. The lasers'' hardware is being upgraded to improve precision and may be tested against satellite targets again, but with no increase in power.</p>
        <p>Mr. Velikhov conceded that ''in principle'' information from this research could be useful in designing a weapon to disable American satellites.</p>
        <p>The visitors were led along the stained linoleum corridors of the four-story main building to inspect the ruby laser, receivers, transmitters and telescope and - on demand - detoured to see the basement power supply.</p>
        <p>They climbed above the rusted steel shell that shields the main beaming mirror to see the control booth where the lasers' aiming device is operated. They then visited the only other building, where the more powerful infrared laser is housed.</p>
        <p>Maj. Gen. Yevgeny V. Tarasov, an official of the proving grounds who oversees the laser center, said it employed 200 people during peak periods, although today it appeared nearly deserted.</p>
        <p>Soviet officials pointed to two features they said proved conclusively the lasers could not be used as weapons.</p>
        <p>One was the laser's low power -about two kilowatts when the more powerful infrared laser leaves the aiming mirror, which Mr. Von hippel calculated would generate a ray roughly the intensity of a sunbeam, insufficient to damage an object in space.</p>
        <p>The other was the reflecting mirror used to focus the infrared beam before it is deflected into space. About the size of a tea saucer and uncooled, it would not withstand a beam of great force, according to Peter V. Zarubin, a laser physicist from the Moscow Institute of Radio Electronics, who said he often travels to Sary-Shagan for research on laser radars.</p>
        <p>The visitors with technical backgrounds said the equipment seemed to conform to the description.</p>
        <p>Asked about the Defense Department's more threatening version of Sary-Shagan, General Tarasov said he was familiar with Pentagon descriptions of Soviet military programs, and generally admired them.</p>
        <p>''As a rule, you know more about our activities than the Soviet people do,'' he said, adding that excessive secrecy had contributed to growing public skepticism of the military here.</p>
        <p>''In this case, you exaggerated,'' he said. ''But that's okay. We write the same kind of things about you.''</p>
