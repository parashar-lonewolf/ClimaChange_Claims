        <p>In a matter of weeks, Mayor Michael Bloomberg is expected to issue his report on what New York needs to do to sustain itself as a desirable destination for residents, businesses and visitors. The report, called PlaNYC 2030, is intended to be an important guidepost for the city's future. Done right, it could become a global model and an important piece of Mr. Bloomberg's legacy.</p>
        <p>To get there, though, the mayor will have to deal aggressively with a vexing problem, traffic congestion. If that piece of the plan falls short, the rest of Mr. Bloomberg's vision won't much matter. In just a couple of decades, New York is expected to add nearly a million more people. To have any hope of keeping people moving, the city will need to take real and substantial action to unclog its roads -- including some form of congestion fee and other disincentives to driving on the busiest streets.</p>
        <p>Besides helping business and boosting the general quality of life, congestion relief would also produce cleaner air, to the enormous benefit of public health, a fact that has so far mostly been missed in the debate over congestion pricing. But a newly released report from Environmental Defense, a nonpartisan group, is likely to give these issues more prominence.</p>
        <p>The report shows that vehicle emissions -- especially dangerous diesel soot -- can pollute the air as far as 1,500 feet from the source. In New York City, that means it's hard to escape them, which is troubling in a city with high asthma rates. And not just asthma but lung problems, as well as heart disease, have been linked to vehicle emissions, which are also thought to contribute to strokes and some kinds of cancers.</p>
        <p>That is all worth considering as Mr. Bloomberg's team tries to balance good policy with what is politically achievable. City Hall has been cautious so far on congestion pricing; the idea has influential proponents, including the city's leading business organization, the Partnership for New York City. But the opposition, including owners of city parking garages, has been vocal as it tries to misrepresent the fee as a tax that targets the little guy.</p>
        <p>For the sake of the city, we hope the voices of reason prevail. Nothing has been as effective as congestion pricing for getting more people out of their cars and on to public transportation, bikes, scooters or their own feet. Fee systems have worked well in London, where daily car trips have been reduced by about 500,000; the fees, meanwhile, have paid for public transportation upgrades, an approach that New York could adapt to expand subway, bus and even ferry service. In Stockholm, residents have now embraced the idea after a trial run dispelled earlier doubts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bloomberg has been a leading voice on the need to reduce emissions in response to the threat of climate change. He has also made a good start in replacing city vehicles with cleaner-burning models. But making meaningful reductions in emissions will require dramatic reductions in the number of cars, buses and trucks that jam the city's streets. And one way to bring that about is to remind people of what gridlock does to our health.</p>
