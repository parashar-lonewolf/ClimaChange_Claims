        <p>With ''JESUS CAMP,'' two documentary filmmakers, Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady, take us into the Christian heartland for a penetrating look into the future. Young children are exhorted to repent their sins, speak in tongues and pray for salvation, and they weep copious tears of ecstasy, inspiration and (it appears) pure hysteria. This is a very particular summer camp, run by Christian youth ministers bent on shaping young leaders of the fundamentalist right; their mandate is to take back America ''for Christ.'' The film is startling and gets to know three very determined young people. The close-up portrait makes you wonder how these children will change as they reach maturity and the age when they question their own conventions (like, is global warming really a media invention?). Opened Friday at the Angelika Film Center, Mercer and Houston Streets, Greenwich Village, (212) 995-2000; and AMC Empire 25, 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue, Manhattan, (212) 398-3939; expands on Sept. 29 to Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington and Chicago.</p>
        <p>Two Buster Keaton classics, ''THE CAMERAMAN'' and ''SPITE MARRIAGE'' will play at Film Forum on Monday, the tail end of their BEST OF BUSTER KEATON series. In ''The Cameraman'' (1928), which was lost for decades in the middle of the last century, this incomparable comedian is in love with a pretty girl who works on MGM newsreels, and sets out to impress her with his camera work. (There's live piano accompaniment for two of the screenings.) In ''Spite Marriage'' from 1929, Keaton's last silent picture (with sound but no dialogue), he plays a star-struck dry cleaner who falls in love with, then unexpectedly marries, a Broadway diva. It's noted for a legendary scene of physical comedy in which Keaton desperately tries to put his drunken bride to bed. 209 West Houston Street, west of Sixth Avenue, South Village, (212) 727-8110.</p>
