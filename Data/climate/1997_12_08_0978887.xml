        <p>Vice President Al Gore arrived here today hoping to ''generate some momentum'' in talks on what to do about global warming, and immediately said he had told the American delegation ''to show increased negotiating flexibility.''</p>
        <p>Even as Mr. Gore signaled that the United States might make some compromises, however, he indicated that it remained committed to its original position on reducing rich countries' emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>''We came to Kyoto to find new ways to bridge our differences,'' Mr. Gore told a high-level gathering of ministers from more than 150 countries as they opened the decisive three-day session of the Kyoto talks. But in so doing, he said, ''we must not waver in our resolve.''</p>
        <p>The United States, he continued, ''remains firmly committed to a strong, binding target that will reduce our own emissions by nearly 30 percent from what they would otherwise be -- a commitment as strong, or stronger, than any we have heard here from any country.''</p>
        <p>The Administration has said previously that it would achieve the 30 percent reduction by cutting its emissions of greenhouse gases back to 1990 levels between 2008 and 2112. That is the target it proposes for all industrialized countries. Environmentalists and European delegates say that target is too low, while representatives of the fossil-fuel industry say it is too aggressive.</p>
        <p>The Vice President extended an olive branch to the developing countries, who have resisted the United States' entreaties to commit themselves to some sort of new emissions-control action. ''We understand that your first priority is to lift your citizens from the poverty so many endure and build strong economies that will assure a better future,'' he said. ''This is your right; it will not be denied.''</p>
        <p>But he reiterated the American desire that developing countries and rich ones participate in joint efforts to reduce emissions in the poorer nations.</p>
        <p>Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, said that Mr. Gore had a ''prime opportunity'' to ''make a strong case for why all the nations of the world must be included in any agreement,'' but that ''instead of asking for binding commitments from developing nations, he offered grand rhetoric on global understandings.''</p>
        <p>What form new American flexibility might take, should it develop, was unclear. Mr. Gore linked it to the adoption of a broad framework encompassing both market mechanisms to reduce emissions and the ''meaningful participation of key developing countries.''</p>
        <p>Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, said the call for flexibility did not necessarily mean that the United States would change its position on targets and timetables for emissions reduction, and that there were other areas of possible compromise. One, said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, might be the number of greenhouse gases included in an agreement.</p>
        <p>Senator Lieberman called the speech ''an important statement that could break the ice jam and result in a major agreement.''</p>
        <p>Some environmentalists also portrayed the speech as a breakthrough.  ''At the eleventh hour, the Vice President's statement has given us some cause for hope,'' said John Adams, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council. Fred Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund, said the speech ''provided the key to unlocking the global gridlock which has paralyzed the negotiation process.''</p>
        <p>Other environmentalists were not so positive. Greenpeace expressed ''extreme disappointment at the speech's failure to commit the U.S. to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions.''</p>
        <p>Representatives of the fossil-fuel and energy-intensive industries like the auto makers were cool to the speech. William F. O'Keefe, chairman of the Global Climate Coalition, an industry group, said the reference to flexibility ''suggests that the delegation is willing to go beyond the President's policy. I think that only means greater trouble for the economy.''</p>
        <p>As the Vice President spoke, perhaps 48 hours remained in which to forge an agreement. While differences had narrowed on some major issues, none were settled.</p>
        <p>Two big areas of concern are under discussion. One is the extent to which industrialized countries should reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, and on what schedule. The other is the question of the near-term role of developing countries in helping solve the problem.</p>
        <p>With the endgame under way, many participants in the talks believed, a settlement was within reach on the question of the rich countries' commitments.</p>
        <p>The European Union has proposed cutting emissions of the three principal greenhouse gases -- carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide -- 15 percent below 1990 levels by 2010. Japan has proposed cuts ranging from 2.5 percent to 5 percent below 1990 levels for the same three gases. The United States favors cutting average emissions for the period 2008 through 2112 back to 1990 levels, but it would include three other greenhouse gases: hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexachloride.</p>
        <p>All six gases trap heat in the atmosphere, although carbon dioxide is by far the most important. The combined effect of the gases, many scientists say, will raise the average global temperature by 2 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100 if emissions are not reduced. This, say the scientists, would cause the oceans to rise, rains to become heavier, floods, droughts and heat waves to become worse, ecological and agricultural zones to shift northward and growing seasons to become longer in northern climes like those of Canada and Russia.</p>
        <p>The European Union also proposes that its member countries be allowed to meet a unionwide cut of 15 percent by requiring some member countries to make deeper cuts while allowing the emissions of others to grow.</p>
