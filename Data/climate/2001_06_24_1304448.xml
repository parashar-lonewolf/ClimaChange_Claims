        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It is clear why the White House has not filled many of its scientific leadership positions (Week in Review, June 17). The Bush administration supports a conservative agenda dictated in large part by the energy and weapons industries. Much of the available science contradicts the objectives of these interest groups and the conservative agenda.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It is clear why the White House has not filled many of its scientific leadership positions (Week in Review, June 17). The Bush administration supports a conservative agenda dictated in large part by the energy and weapons industries. Much of the available science contradicts the objectives of these interest groups and the conservative agenda.</p>
        <p>This is best exemplified by the plethora of science doubting the wisdom of the White House's deliberations and actions regarding global climate change and the missile shield. Consequently, the administration avoids appointing advisers and leaders who, if performing their jobs correctly, would find serious scientific fault with these policies.</p>
        <p>This approach to governing could be very bad for the country, because it replaces intelligence and sound guidance in the decision-making process with bias and irrationality.</p>
