        <p>IN SEARCH OF DEEP TIME</p>
        <p>Beyond the Fossil Record</p>
        <p>to a New History of Life.</p>
        <p>By Henry Gee.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 267 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>The Free Press. $26.</p>
        <p>In the 1770's, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, the great naturalist at the Paris Museum, reported on his experiments to determine the age of the earth. The prevailing view retained the biblical estimate of about 6,000 years of earth's history. Buffon attempted a scientific calculation based on new cosmological assumptions. He supposed that the earth began as a molten ball that had been knocked loose from the sun by a meteor. He then tried to estimate how long it would take a fiery earth to cool so as to be fit for habitation. Initially he heated to incandescence iron spheres, rocks and other materials of different volumes and timed their rate of cooling.</p>
        <p>The volume of the earth had been fixed to a surprising degree of accuracy in the ancient period. So the calculation required only a simple proportion: volume of the model to the time of cooling would be equivalent to volume of the earth to the time of its cooling. He thus estimated about 75,000 years for the age of the earth. Yet he knew that certain geological processes (such as sedimentary depositions) would have demanded a vastly longer time -- some 10 million years, he judged. When he published his findings, however, he gave the more conservative figure. The human mind, he thought, simply could not comprehend that ''dark abyss of time.'' The abyss has certainly grown deeper with our current value of 4.5 billion years for the age of the earth.</p>
        <p>Henry Gee, an editor at the journal Nature in London, also believes the human mind falls into darkness when attempting to probe deep time. His book thus bears a rather discomforting title, since its principal argument is that we can know nothing of evolutionary processes that occurred during those periods that recede far into the past. He maintains that only fanciful guessing and aggrandizing prejudice could support any scenarios that would describe, for instance, the evolution of limbs in creatures venturing from the sea or the rise of Homo sapiens from hominid progenitors. He rejects as unscientific the current hypothesis that the dinosaurs went extinct because an asteroid collided with the earth and caused catastrophic climate change. For, after all, ''you cannot go back in time to watch the dinosaurs become extinct.''</p>
        <p>To be scientifically supported, a hypothesis must, he urges, be amenable to test; but there is no way experimentally to test events that occurred in the past. He cushions the irritatingly frequent reiteration of this thesis with salutary cautions: in trying to grapple with past events, we can never be sure we have isolated all pertinent causal factors; as we move farther back in time, evidence becomes less available, and unsure; and adaptations exhibited by contemporary animals -- for instance, wings adapted for flight in birds -- may not initially have arisen to perform the same functions in ancestors.</p>
        <p>To drive home this last admonition, Gee focuses several chapters on traditional beliefs about processes of evolutionary acquisition that have had to be scotched in light of new evidence. Thus his penultimate chapter describes research seeming to show that certain species of dinosaurs developed birdlike adaptations -- feathers and light, hollow bones -- prior to evolving true wings. Hence those adaptations could not have been the result of animals' gliding from treetops in efforts at primitive flight, as some ''voodoo paleontology'' has suggested. We just cannot know how creatures took to the air.</p>
        <p>The book would have been helped had Gee included illustrations of the more exotic creatures he describes -- the Icthyostega (a fishlike, four-limbed animal) or the recently discovered Confuciusornis (a birdlike dinosaur). But he is ready with the homey example to make his points vivid. He suggests, for instance, that if you were given a box of old, dateless photographs of long-dead relatives, you would lack the experience to arrange them chronologically -- likewise with the bare, fragmented fossils that litter our museums. Even the expert eye, he argues, could not order such fossils in any reasonable patterns of ancestor-and-descendant relationships, so shrouded in deep time are they.</p>
        <p>Gee's friendly example, though, is less a convincing illustration of his thesis than a disclosure of constricted epistemological assumptions. If you examined the context revealed in your photos -- the different clothing worn by relatives, the style of their hair and the background furniture, among other things -- and considered the position of the photos in the box and perhaps even made a chemical analysis of the paper, you might well construct some pretty plausible chronological arrangements. Further, similarity of facial features, along with context, might well allow you to place individuals into families and order their members according to age. Only the most unimaginative empiricist would require dates on the photos to make a reasonable temporal series.</p>
        <p>Traditional paleontologists have comparably investigated osteological structures and used contextual associations, stratigraphic layering and radiometric dating to organize different animal groups into likely patterns of ancestors and descendants. Our own species has been served by cadres of such scientists, who have followed our history from australopithecines like Lucy, who roamed Africa about three and a half million years ago, through various descendant branches. All but one of the branches lead to extinct cousins (like the neanderthals), and the one exception connects to our immediate predecessors' coming out of Africa about 100,000 years ago. These evolutionary schemes, of course, are subject to dispute and further improvement, but such is the nature of all science.</p>
        <p>In place of evolutionary genealogies, Gee urges that cladistical techniques be used to arrange contemporary species and fossil relatives. Cladistics is a method originally proposed in the 1950's by the East German entomologist Willi Hennig. His ideas took hold only in the 1960's, after his work had been translated into English and considerably revised by his American editors -- Hennig's prose proved a challenge even to native speakers of German. Gee presents a lucid introductory account of cladistics, touting its supposedly more objective methods over traditional evolutionary systematics.</p>
        <p>The method organizes both living and extinct species into nesting pairs, associated by the similarity of their respective traits. Cladists assume that related species (Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis, for instance) inherited similar traits from a recent common ancestor, but they do not attempt to identify that ancestor with any species extant or extinct. The early cladists regarded efforts at such identification as speculatively beyond empirical analysis of immediately observable traits, so their reference to a ''recent common ancestor'' remained only an empty placeholder. The American Museum of Natural History in New York became the breeding ground for the new enthusiasts during the late 60's and 70's.</p>
        <p>Contemporary evolutionary systematists happily employ the techniques of cladism but usually regard them only as tools for constructing genealogical patterns that fill in the missing ancestors, or at least their close relatives. They reject the epistemological dogmas of cladists of the strict observance, who believe that ''no science can ever be historical.'' Too bad, I suppose, for astrophysics, geophysics, archaeology and just plain history. The methods used to recover the events of the Peloponnesian War or the French Revolution are logically not different from those employed to discover the processes of stellar collapse or dinosaur extinction. No one can now be present at events of the past, no matter how shallow or deep the time. All we have are theories and their evidence with which to reconstruct human, biological and physical history. When the evidence is plentiful and the theories well confirmed, we can be more confident of the historical scenarios we propose; when theories are weak or evidence scarce, we ought to be more circumspect.</p>
        <p>Gee makes the usual obeisance to Darwin, despite his lack of patience with the ''Origin of Species'' because of its ''turgid'' prose and ''lengthy'' sentences. Had he taken more time with the book, he might have thought more deeply on Darwin's conviction that ''when we regard every production of nature as one which has had a history . . . how far more interesting, I speak from experience, will the study of natural history become!''</p>
