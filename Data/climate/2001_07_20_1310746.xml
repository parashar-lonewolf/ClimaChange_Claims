        <p>Nearly eight months after formal talks over a proposed climate treaty fell apart in The Hague, negotiations resumed here today in nearly as tangled and troubled a state.</p>
        <p>Informal talks started on Monday, and today environment ministers and other senior diplomats who represented 178 nations took their seats. Jan Pronk, chairman of the talks since last year, admonished them to find consensus, albeit without the United States, the largest emitter of heat-trapping gases. The United States has rejected the treaty.</p>
        <p>''We did a good job in Kyoto,'' Mr. Pronk, of the Netherlands, said, defending the document negotiated in 1997 in Japan. ''It is the only game in town. It is the best we have.''</p>
        <p>The accord, now called the Kyoto Protocol, would be the first treaty to require industrialized countries to cut emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases linked to a potentially disruptive warming trend. Because it could have just as many effects on economies as on the environment, negotiations have proved extraordinarily complex and contentious.</p>
        <p>In talks today, wealthy countries still disagreed over rules to measure cuts and punish those that failed to meet targets. Poor countries insisted that wealthy ones help pay for damage from changing temperatures and rising sea levels, and they want control over spending that money.</p>
        <p>Although President Bush rejected the treaty months ago, the United States, even from the sidelines, threw a long shadow over the officials, corporate lobbyists and environmentalists who milled in the halls of the Maritim Hotel. American negotiators, ending their routine of nightly news conferences last year, remained deeply immersed in talks on points that they said could harm the country's interests. At least one point could imperil the effort to close out the talks and allow countries to seek ratification. That point is a proposal for a $1 billion-a-year fund to help developing countries.</p>
        <p>Under a negotiating text used as a guide for the talks, some of that money would be paid by all countries that have signed an existing climate treaty, including the United States. That is a structure that some developing countries prefer, because it guarantees that they will receive the money even if the Kyoto Protocol never takes effect. But it could also theoretically mean that the United States would have to pay for parts of the Kyoto pact even though Mr. Bush has rejected it.</p>
        <p>At a news session this evening, Mr. Pronk appeared to side with Washington on that point. ''If you are not becoming a party to the protocol,'' he said, ''it would not be fair to be expected to have implicitly or indirectly similar obligations as those countries who become a party.''</p>
        <p>That could become a sticking point at the conference if the developing countries, 134 of which act as a bloc, insist that the proposed payment structure follow the current plan.</p>
        <p>Other disputes simmered unrelated to United States interests. Europe, Japan and Canada once again debated the merits of forests as a means of absorbing carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>Generally, however, the tone was more subdued at this meeting than the one that was suspended last fall, when cream pies were thrown at American negotiators and protesters climbed to the rafters of the Dutch conference center.</p>
        <p>''At The Hague, there was a sense of urgency,'' said Glenn Kelly, executive director of the Global Climate Coalition, a lobby in Washington that has fought the protocol through contributions from industry. ''Here it's more like being at the wake for a not-so-well-liked second cousin.''</p>
