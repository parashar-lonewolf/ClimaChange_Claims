        <p>THE best adapted and most dominant species of wild plants and animals may be, paradoxically, the most vulnerable to long-term extinction as a result of habitat loss, say ecologists in the United States and Britain.</p>
        <p>But since the species do not actually go extinct for 50 to 500 years after the fragmentation of their habitat dooms them, the researchers report, natural areas may now look healthier than they really are.</p>
        <p>The good news, the scientists say, is that the long interval between habitat fragmentation and the ultimate death of species allows time to rescue many or most of them through habitat restoration.</p>
        <p>Habitat loss and fragmentation brought about by human activity are advancing apace around the world. Because extinctions occur generations after fragmentation takes place, the scientists reported in the British journal Nature this month, they constitute an ecological "debt" that will come due in the future unless it is repaid through restoration.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, they found, the more habitat that is lost, the more severe are the effects of further loss. For instance, when a 1,000-acre habitat has lost 200 acres, the loss of one additional acre might doom five more species to eventual extinction. But after 900 acres have been lost, the loss of an additional acre might doom 40 more species.</p>
        <p>"The 10 percent that's left is vitally important to the preservation of those organisms," said one of the researchers, Dr. David Tilman, an ecologist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. "Since they don't go extinct immediately, there is time for remedial action." The other researchers are Dr. Robert M. May and Dr. Martin A. Nowak of Oxford University in England and Clarence L. Lehman of the University of Minnesota.</p>
        <p>The theory is based largely on experiments carried out on Minnesota prairies and oak savannas by Dr. Tilman and his colleagues. They confirmed, at least in this case, the belief of many biologists that some species of plants concentrate their energy on producing structures that equip them to out-compete other species for dominance in a given habitat. These structures include, for instance, deep roots that enable them to withstand fire and tall stems that allow them to shade out other plants. Many other species, on the other hand, were found to concentrate their resources not on competitive structures but on seed production, which enables them to thrive on disturbed ground and to disperse and colonize new habitat more readily.</p>
        <p>This ecological trade-off was built into a computerized model whose workings were tested against reality in the field. The experimenters then used the model to determine what would happen when habitat is destroyed. They found, Dr. Tilman said, "that as a habitat is fragmented by habitat destruction, the species that are the best competitors -- which often means they are the most abundant species in these fragments -- are the species most susceptible to long-term extinction."</p>
        <p>The reason, he said, is that "their poor dispersal ability means they have a very low chance of being able to move through a landscape from one habitat to another." They become trapped in isolated patches, which can be created by a relatively small amount of habitat destruction. Eventually, fire, disease, a shortage of nutrients or natural mortality will wipe out the species in a given patch. At some level of fragmentation this happens in all patches, and the species become extinct. These stay-in-place species are often crucial to ecosystem functions like nutrient cycling and energy flow, Dr. Tilman said, and their loss makes ecosystems less stable and productive.</p>
        <p>Species that have evolved as good seed dispersers not only are able to hopscotch across landscapes to colonize new patches, the researchers say, they also tend to proliferate in their original patches as their onetime competitors fade away. These plants tend to be "weedy" species, good at taking root on disturbed ground or ground left open by their competitors.</p>
        <p>An example of a dominant, competitive species under threat is the bur oak, which characterizes the nearly vanished tall grass savannas of the upper Middle West. "They are the dominant tree species, but they are very slow at invading sites," Dr. Tilman said. On the Minnesota study site are three-to-five-acre fields that were farmed and then abandoned as long as 70 years ago, surrounded on all sides by remnants of oak savanna. But no oaks have invaded those abandoned farms, even though they are immediately adjacent.</p>
        <p>The oaks, which resist fire and create patterns of shade and light that largely dictate what species of grasses and wildflowers grow under them, "put almost all their efforts into competing in that habitat and very little into dispersal," said Dr. Tilman. "After disturbance, it takes on the order of 200 years for an oak savanna to redevelop, assuming it can invade right from the edge of the patch. The chance of bur oaks going from one site to another that can support them becomes incredibly small."</p>
        <p>Animals, too, divide into stay-put competitors and wide-ranging dispersers, he said. Birds like warblers, vireos and pileated woodpeckers, for instance, are good at competing for specialized foods in the deep woods, where they stay put and avoid flying across open land. Other species like robins, starlings and grackles do not compete well in the deep woods but are good at ranging far and wide, searching for food. Study after study, Dr. Tilman said, reports the same kinds of trade-offs in animal communities from insects to large mammals: moose, for instance, are adapted and generally confined to wilderness, while deer do not compete well in the deep woods but roam far and wide, flourishing and multiplying in disturbed areas.</p>
        <p>No one knows exactly how much of the earth's wild habitat has been significantly disturbed by humans, but some biologists believe it might be as much as half. If that is so, Dr. Tilman's model says, habitat destruction has put at least 100,000 to 300,000 plant and animal species worldwide into the same boat as the bur oaks and set them on their way to eventual extinction. He says, however that this calculation has "a lot of noise in it" and is a "ballpark estimate."</p>
        <p>Ecologists have long known that many birds and mammals went extinct when rising sea levels broke New Guinea into a series of island fragments 10,000 years ago, and scientists have thought that this same phenomenon applies to "islands" of fragmented habitat on land. If further study shows that the extinct New Guinea species were dominant competitors, Dr. Tilman says, "then the predictions of our theory must be taken very seriously."</p>
        <p>From a scientific point of view, the work's main value is that the mathematical models have enabled the researchers to describe explicitly the trade-off between dispersal and competitive ability, said Dr. Edward O. Wilson, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard University who is an authority on extinction and biological diversity. "No one had done that before," he said, noting that the researchers have also provided a "more precise and explicit statement" about the time lag between habitat fragmentation and extinction.</p>
        <p>What is needed now, Dr. Wilson said, is more observational data "so the theoreticians and field researchers can develop together evermore sophisticated estimates."</p>
        <p>Assuming the theory emerging from the new work is correct, Dr. Tilman said, it is uncertain how generally it might apply. He said he is "very sure" that the trade-off that species make between competitiveness and dispersal ability is a major mechanism enabling diverse species to coexist in grasslands, savannas and forests. But whether that is so for other sorts of ecosystems is not clear, he said.</p>
        <p>Many relatively small-scale efforts to restore habitat in various kinds of ecosystems are under way across the United States and in some foreign countries. To the extent that Dr. Tilman's theory is right and applies generally, it bodes well for these efforts: replanting, consolidating and relinking even a small amount of highly fragmented habitat may forestall many extinctions. Just as species loss becomes more severe per acre as habitat loss increases, says Dr. Tilman, so the number saved would be especially high per acre early in the game, as the pattern of habitat loss begins to reverse. "If we restore, we gain a lot," he said.</p>
        <p>Attempting to re-establish the fading species one at a time probably would not work, he said; it would be necessary to focus on whole ecosystems and, within them, to restore and reconnect as many patches of habitat as possible.</p>
        <p>"That," he said, "means humans have to intervene."</p>
