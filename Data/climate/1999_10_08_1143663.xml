        <p>Vice President Al Gore, who prides himself for his environmental record, was stung last month when an environmental group, Friends of the Earth, endorsed former Senator Bill Bradley, his rival for the Democratic Presidential nomination.

        <p>Vice President Al Gore, who prides himself for his environmental record, was stung last month when an environmental group, Friends of the Earth, endorsed former Senator Bill Bradley, his rival for the Democratic Presidential nomination. Yesterday some of Mr. Gore's supporters struck back, holding a fund-raising lunch in midtown Manhattan that featured endorsements from some leading New York environmentalists, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Lawrence Rockefeller.</p>
        <p>''He's our last best chance to save the planet,'' said Mr. Kennedy, the oldest son of former Senator Robert F. Kennedy and an environmental lawyer, as he urged his audience to focus full time on the election.</p>
        <p>''Put down your litigation,'' he told the roughly 100 environmental leaders, many of them lawyers, who gave $1,000 each to Mr. Gore. ''Put down your lobbying. Forget about Albany. Forget about anything else you're doing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rockefeller, the nephew of former Gov. Nelson Rockefeller and also an environmental lawyer -- and a Republican -- said he was crossing party lines to support Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to put party labels aside and put our kids' future first and the earth's future,'' he said, calling Mr. Gore ''an environmental champion.''</p>
        <p>Both said that Mr. Gore, author of ''Earth in the Balance,'' had led the fight to protect air and water quality and to clean up toxic waste sites. They also lauded him for his efforts to combat global warming and increase the fuel efficiency of cars without increasing the costs, and for his ''livability agenda'' to reduce traffic jams and preserve open space.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennedy said later that yesterday's event was held in part to counter the Friends of the Earth's endorsement of Mr. Bradley, who the group said was more effective in pushing environmental matters.</p>
        <p>''That was among the events that brought us together,'' Mr. Kennedy said, citing these others: ''Gore's getting a raw deal in the press, that George W.'s getting a free ride and sometimes your friends have to stand up when there's a lot of momentum against you.''</p>
        <p>The reference was to polls showing that Mr. Bradley is running even, if not ahead, of the Vice President in crucial states like New York and New Hampshire and that Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican front-runner, maintains a solid lead over both nationally.</p>
        <p>But instead of comparing Mr. Gore's record with that of Mr. Bradley, the Gore supporters -- and Mr. Gore himself -- compared it with that of Mr. Bush, whose state is home to a quarter of the nation's oil refineries and two-thirds of its chemical industries.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said that Houston was overtaking Los Angeles as the city with the worst smog in America.  ''Under Governor Bush, Texas has ranked No. 1 in America for carcinogens in the air, No. 1 in America for toxic releases into the air, into the water and into the soil,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He said Mr. Bush had received financial backing from polluters who opposed environmental regulations.</p>
        <p>''That kind of approach cannot be taken into the White House,'' Mr. Gore said, describing Mr. Bush as ''a person who carries water -- dirty water -- for the chemical industry.'' As applause erupted, Mr. Gore said: ''I'm going to tell it like it is!''</p>
        <p>Scott McClellan, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, defended his environmental record. Under Governor Bush, Mr. McClellan said, Texas has planned to reduce air emissions by 250,000 tons annually, the equivalent of removing 5.5 million cars from the road.</p>
        <p>He also said that Mr. Gore, whom President George Bush once labeled ''ozone man,'' had ''a long history of weird and extreme environmental ideas,'' including his support for the Kyoto global-warming treaty.</p>
        <p>Still, the Vice President seemed to have Mr. Bradley on his mind as he uttered some thoughts throughout his environmental speech about ''authenticity.'' Bradley supporters frequently cite that quality as a strength in comparison with Mr. Gore, who is often criticized as overcalculating and cautious.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said that everyone had an ''obligation to be authentic and to integrate all the different parts of our lives into a coherent and authentic expression of who we are and what's most important in our lives.''</p>
        <p>He said he had worked on environmental issues for a long time, but then referred without elaboration to a challenge in his personal life that forced him to think about environmental policy anew.</p>
        <p>His remarks seemed to reflect his current struggle to try to reveal more about himself in his campaign stump speech, which he did not deliver today.</p>
        <p>''Just as in our personal lives when we find out how to be authentic and speak from the heart, it turns out to be easier than any other way of being,'' Mr. Gore said.</p>
        <p>--------------------</p>
        <p>Teachers' Unit Endorses Gore</p>
        <p>The political committee of the nation's largest labor union, the National Education Association, endorsed Mr. Gore yesterday to be the Democratic nominee for President -- with the expectation that the association's executive board would issue the official endorsement of him today.</p>
        <p>The move by the union, which has 2.5 million members, comes after the nation's other large teachers' union, the million-member American Federation of Teachers, endorsed Mr. Gore on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The National Education Association is not part of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which will debate at its convention next week whether to endorse Mr. Gore. But an endorsement by the education association, because of its membership and the size of its political action fund, is expected to be a major boost for Mr. Gore.</p>
