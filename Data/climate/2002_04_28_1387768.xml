        <p>Armed with a study that shows wind generation is feasible off the South Shore, the Long Island Power Authority has announced plans to build 33 offshore wind generators that would generate 100 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 100,000 homes.</p>
        <p>Richard Kessel, LIPA's chairman, said that by the time an environmental review was conducted and all of the necessary state, federal and local permits were obtained, technology would be sufficiently developed to allow the windmills to be anchored six miles offshore in 100 feet of water.</p>

        <p>Armed with a study that shows wind generation is feasible off the South Shore, the Long Island Power Authority has announced plans to build 33 offshore wind generators that would generate 100 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 100,000 homes.</p>
        <p>Richard Kessel, LIPA's chairman, said that by the time an environmental review was conducted and all of the necessary state, federal and local permits were obtained, technology would be sufficiently developed to allow the windmills to be anchored six miles offshore in 100 feet of water.</p>
        <p>A meeting is scheduled June 25 with wind generation developers to discuss the project, and Mr. Kessel said he hoped LIPA would be prepared to solicit bids by the end of the year. The project is tentatively scheduled for completion in 2006.</p>
        <p>The project's cost is estimated at $190 million to $220 million.</p>
        <p>''Wind energy has tremendous potential for Long Island and now that we see it is feasible, let's use it,'' Mr. Kessel said. ''The more wind we use, the less we rely on fossil fuels.''</p>
        <p>Another wind generator farm is proposed off Cape Cod. Mr. Kessel said opposition there has come from those who object to seeing windmills along the horizon and that he expected to hear similar complaints.</p>
        <p>But Sarah Meyland, executive director of the Citizens Campaign for the Environment in Farmingdale, said the alternative was worse.</p>
        <p>''If we don't turn to alternative energy like wind, the quality of the atmosphere is going to be so poor that you won't be able to see anything offshore,'' she said. ''I think everyone who is concerned about the environment is supportive of alternative energy technology.''</p>
