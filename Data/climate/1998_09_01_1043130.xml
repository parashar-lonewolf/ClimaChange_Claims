        <p>THE first animals on earth may have been shocked into existence by the evolutionary one-two punch of a climatic episode so cold that the oceans froze -- snowball earth -- followed by one of the hottest periods in earth history, according to a new hypothesis based largely on studies of carbon atoms in ancient sediments.</p>
        <p>''We think we have, finally, an explanation for the first appearance of animal life on earth,'' said Dr. Paul F. Hoffman, a geologist at Harvard University who led the study, a report of which appears in the current issue of Science. It is, he said, a question that ''has bedeviled paleontologists since before Darwin.''</p>
        <p>Living things had materialized by 3.8 billion years ago, 700 million or 800 million years after the planet was formed out of the same interstellar dust cloud that gave birth to the sun. But as far as scientists can tell, for the next 3 billion years life consisted of nothing more complex than bacteria and algae. The first tiny animals, simple disk-shaped creatures, are thought to have appeared about 600 million years ago, and the first diverse animals soon afterward.  Both events occurred near the end of a period of alternating episodes of snowball earth and hothouse earth.  ''We think it's not a coincidence,'' Dr. Hoffman said.</p>
        <p>Cataclysmic changes in the environment, it is now widely believed, have often provided the impetus for evolutionary change by wiping out some species and paving the way for others to arise. Many such episodes have been documented, but they are  far less drastic than the events proposed by Dr. Hoffman.</p>
        <p>Their novel idea about the relationship of the snowball-earth cycles to the rise of animal life is untested. It is not clear that a direct connection exists between snowball earth, hothouse earth and the appearance of animals, said Dr. Douglas Irwin, a paleontologist at the Smithsonian Institution who studies large-scale evolutionary patterns. ''But clearly,  these kinds of extreme environmental fluctuations, if borne out, would provide a very powerful motor of evolutionary change,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Hoffman study may also lend  weight to the controversial theory of snowball earth itself and help explain how the earth recovered from that long-ago superglaciation -- and why there has never been another so severe. The animals themselves, it seems, may play a role in preventing the latter occurrence.</p>
        <p>The idea of snowball earth was proposed in 1992 by Dr. Joseph L. Kirschvink of the California Institute of Technology as a possible explanation for magnetic and chemical evidence that ice had once existed near the equator and that little or no oxygen had entered the ocean from the atmosphere at that time.</p>
        <p>The idea stirred instant contention. Some scientists thought that the overturning of ocean layers could explain the puzzling data. Others believed a tilt in the earth's axis different from today's might have been  responsible. And computer models of the climate system had suggested that once the earth entered a totally frozen state, it would not be able to recover from it.</p>
        <p>But other experts, including Dr. Ken Caldeira, now of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, and Dr. James F. Kasting of Pennsylvania State University, as well as Dr. Kirschvink, suggested a possible way out: emissions of carbon dioxide from terrestrial volcanoes, which would trap heat in the atmosphere and build up over millions of years, rewarming the planet.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hoffman and his colleagues have examined isotopes of carbon buried in ancient ocean sediments in what is now Namibia between 750 million and 570 million years ago.  The relative amounts of the two isotopes, carbon 12 and carbon 13, vary  depending on how much organic carbon, the residue of dead microbes, is being buried in the sediments. A low ratio signifies that none is being buried, as would happen if the earth froze over. This is because photosynthesis in the ocean would cease, and  no carbon-containing microbes would exist to die and be buried.</p>
        <p>The carbon evidence was the piece of the puzzle Dr. Hoffman needed to flesh out the new hypothesis. According to it, at least four snowball glaciations took place between 750 million  and 570 million years ago, each followed by a hothouse episode. A much earlier glaciation might also have frozen the seas about 2.2 billion years ago. The glaciations were touched off, according to the hypothesis, when an ancient supercontinent called Rodinia broke into several  continents. This created many thousands of miles of shoreline sediments, along the coasts of the newly formed Pacific Ocean and a precursor of the Atlantic, for instance,  where carbon could be buried. The scenario then continues:</p>
        <p>As more carbon was buried, less of the element, in the form of carbon dioxide, remained available for the atmosphere. The planet cooled as a result. Eventually, accumulating snow and ice reflected so much of the sun's heat that the catastrophic snowball state was reached, with ice covering the seas.</p>
        <p>But terrestrial volcanoes replenished the atmospheric carbon dioxide over several million years. Eventually, the ice and snow melted, a process that might have taken only a few thousand years. After the melting, less heat was reflected from the planet, and the warming atmosphere evaporated more water from the oceans. Water vapor is an even more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. The result, according to the Hoffman hypothesis, was a catastrophic warming.</p>
        <p>''I like the story,'' Dr. Kasting said.  ''It appears to fit. From a climatic standpoint, it makes a lot of sense.''  On the other hand, he said, ''it's going to be controversial.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, Dr. Louis Derry, a geochemist at Cornell University, called the hypothesis ''speculative'' and the evidence on which it is based ''ambiguous.'' The idea is ''kind of neat,'' he said, in that it provides a framework for explaining several kinds of evidence. But, he said, ''It's not clear that it's compatible with all the data we have.''</p>
        <p>How might the cataclysms have stimulated the appearance of animals? First, Dr. Hoffman contends, most of the microscopic creatures in the sea would have died, dwarfing any mass extinction since. But a few, because of their genetic makeup, would have been tough enough to survive, and they could have repopulated the world in new forms once the icebox and hothouse climates had passed. Some experts now even postulate that environmental stress can prompt organisms to change their genetic makeup to overcome the stress.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hoffman said the rise of animals might have prevented the snowball earth from recurring.  Snails and worms in the coastal sediments eat organic carbon and churn the sediments so that it is difficult to bury carbon there, according to this view. That means more carbon is recycled into the atmosphere, keeping the planet warm.</p>
        <p>All of this is subject to further testing and investigation, as Dr. Hoffman noted. Dr. Derry called the part about the origin of animals ''highly speculative,'' and Dr. Kasting noted that it was puzzling how a mass extinction of the order proposed by Dr. Hoffman could have gone unnoticed by scientists. ''Maybe it's just the paucity of the fossil record,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Still, Dr. Hoffman contends that his hypothesis explains ''all the major geological features of this time period.'' That, he said, ''is when you know you're on the right track.''</p>
