        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Record heat in the late 1980's and early 90's helped propel agreement on the climate treaty signed at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. Since then industrialized countries, including the United States, have been formulating "action plans" to implement the treaty. Unfortunately, relatively cool weather took the heat off policy makers, and most countries have shied from politically difficult but effective measures, such as cutting subsidies for fossil fuels and raising automotive efficiency standards.</p>
        <p>As indicated by "A Global Warming Resumed in 1994, Climate Data Show" (front page, Jan. 27), it seems clear that the relative cooling was a temporary effect of the Mount Pinatubo volcano. As the ash injected into the atmosphere by Pinatubo clears, temperatures have begun to rebound, just as the climate models predicted.</p>
        <p>We should not risk massive disruption of the earth's climate system because public attention waxes and wanes with short-term weather fluctuations. The National Academy of Sciences and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have made it clear that in the long run global warming is likely to be here to stay unless greenhouse-gas emissions are cut substantially.</p>
        <p>Negotiators will gather at the United Nations in New York Feb. 6 for the last round of talks prior to the first conference of parties to the climate treaty. It is time for policy makers to get serious about cutting emissions by adopting a protocol to the climate treaty with binding commitments, and specific policies to back them up. DANIEL LASHOF Senior Scientist Natural Resources Defense Council Washington, Jan. 27, 1995</p>
