        <p>The energy bill that Congress finally sent to the White House today is far from a panacea for a country addicted to foreign oil. But it lays potentially important building blocks for a serious energy strategy in the future, bringing consumers closer to the day when they can choose to drive battery-powered cars and live in homes heated by wind or solar energy.</p>
        <p>The legislation overhauls and expands the Government's role in the energy marketplace, carving a place for wind- and solar-power producers in the utility industry and instructing the Energy Department to enter into joint ventures with private companies to market electric motor vehicles.</p>
        <p>Washington will set maximum flow rates for shower heads, toilets and faucets, while monitoring light bulbs and home heating systems with mandatory efficiency standards. Just a Beginning</p>
        <p>What the bill will not do is seriously reduce the country's appetite for oil -- the source of 40 percent of the nation's energy and a big slice of the trade deficit. The legislation focuses on electrical power, renewable energy sources and conservation -- a beginning, proponents say, to larger projects to come in the next few years. The White House has indicated that President Bush will sign the bill.</p>
        <p>"We still have to produce more energy," said Senator Malcolm Wallop, Republican of Wyoming and a principal sponsor of the bill. "But it's fair to establish a nudge, and that's what we've done. In places where things work out, we can accelerate later."</p>
        <p>Conservationists are not happy with the bill because the automobile lobby maneuvered to get higher automobile fuel efficiency standards struck from it. But they are expressing hope that the industrial-policy components of the legislation, intended to promote alternative and renewable fuels, could be expanded rapidly if the White House and Congress are committed to them.</p>
        <p>During a session in which philosophical differences over Government's role in the marketplace blocked much action on the economy, Congressional Democrats and the Bush Administration agreed to promote a modest version of industrial policy in the energy bill to encourage the development of motor vehicles that run on alternative fuels like natural gas, batteries, electricity and methane. Government's Goal</p>
        <p>The legislation will require the Federal Government to help create a market for such cleaner-fuel vehicles by purchasing at least 5,000 alternative-fuel cars and light trucks in 1993, 7,500 more in 1994 and 10,000 in 1995. By 1999, 75 percent of the cars and light trucks the Federal Government buys are supposed to run on alternative fuels.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the provision will mandate that state governments buy cleaner-fuel vehicles, rising from 10 percent of their new fleets in 1995 to 75 percent in 2000.</p>
        <p>California and several Northeastern states have taken the lead in this area by adopting strict antipollution rules that will require the sale of tens of thousands of vehicles that run on alternative fuels.</p>
        <p>Congressional proponents compared their efforts to creating an egg that will eventually hatch into a chicken.</p>
        <p>Industrial-policy mandates extend to the private sector, requiring companies that produce or market alternative fuels to convert their fleets to the new energy sources as well, as some private utilities have already done.</p>
        <p>The mandates for new alternative-fuel fleets may be innovative, but it will take more than a decade for them to have more than a minor impact on oil consumption, despite the threat of higher fuel prices and long gasoline lines raised yet again by the Persian Gulf war last year. With the passing of the gulf crisis and the calming of the oil markets, the most ambitious conservation and production proposals in the bill were dropped.</p>
        <p>All told, the Energy Department estimates the bill will reduce oil imports by about 1.4 million barrels a day from what they would otherwise have been in the year 2000 and by about 4.7 million barrels a day in 2010. The total demand for energy is to be reduced by about 6 percent by that year. The country consumes 17 million barrels of oil daily, about 50 percent of which is imported.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most far-reaching measure in the 1,300-page bill revamps utility regulations to increase competition at the wholesale level. It will tear down regulatory walls that currently prohibit small energy producers -- like those attempting to exploit renewable geothermal, wind and solar energy sources -- from obtaining access to the transmission lines of larger, more established utilities. Some studies show that the measure could lower monthly electricity bills 5 to 15 percent over the next decade.</p>
        <p>Merribel S. Ayres, executive director of the National Independent Energy Producers, an organization representing the independent power industry, said the change would provide a wider menu of competing energy sources to utility planners, which "will mean upward pressure for innovation and efficiency and downward pressure on price." Licensing of Nuclear Plants</p>
        <p>The nuclear power industry has been in a long slump since the Three Mile Island accident in 1978, and its future remains uncertain. But the energy bill certainly improves its prospects. The bill eases restrictions in the way of opening a proposed nuclear waste dump at Yucca Mountain in the Nevada desert, which many nuclear power advocates hope will some day be available to store highly radioactive materials like spent fuel rods.</p>
        <p>More immediately, the bill will streamline licensing of new nuclear power plants by combining the separate processes by which companies acquire construction permits and operating licenses before construction.</p>
        <p>Praising the change in licensing procedures, Phillip Bayne, president of the United States Council for Energy Awareness, a pro-nuclear group, said, "The bill will give utilities and their investors a new legal framework that helps assure that nuclear power plants can be built on schedule and on budget, under regulations that are fair, stable and consistent."</p>
