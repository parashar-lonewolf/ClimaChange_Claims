        <p>Before leaving politics behind and heading out to tour India's heartland, President Clinton laid out a picture of the world today in which this nation would have the ''ability to shape the character of our time'' by renouncing its nuclear weapons.</p>
        <p>Making an impassioned argument to the Indian Parliament, Mr. Clinton laced his comments with respect for a country that is sensitive to being lectured to, but reminded its leaders that the United States and Russia are also planning to sharply reduce their stockpiles.</p>
        <p>The president said that India, whose leaders told him during talks here that the nation was committed to keeping its nuclear weapons but would not carry out further tests, could make an immense impact with its choice.</p>
        <p>''If India's nuclear tests shook the world, India's leadership for nonproliferation can certainly move the world,'' Mr. Clinton said to an audience that included Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, his cabinet and legislators. In talks on Monday, the prime minister told Mr. Clinton that India needed to maintain a nuclear deterrence for its security. India tested nuclear weapons in May 1998 and its neighbor Pakistan quickly followed.</p>
        <p>The prime minister's national security adviser, Brajesh Mishra, has argued that its nuclear deterrence has kept the conflict from widening in Kashmir, the Himalayan territory claimed by both India and Pakistan where their forces clash along an uneasy cease-fire line. But Mr. Clinton pointed out that the massacre of 35 Sikhs in Kashmir this week reinforced the need for dialogue.</p>
        <p>The president's speech in the circular Parliament chamber capped the official part of his visit to India.  Immediately afterward, he took on the mantle of special tourist as he began a three-day tour of India. With his daughter, Chelsea, Mr. Clinton visited the Taj Mahal on the outskirts of this northern Indian town, posed against the majestic backdrop of the white marble tomb built by a 17th-century mogul in honor of the love for his wife, and then disappeared inside for a personal tour.</p>
        <p>The complex at the Taj Mahal was closed early this morning in preparation for Mr. Clinton's arrival so that when he and Chelsea emerged arm-in-arm for their walk toward the mausoleum, the lawns and the building itself, usually teeming with tourists, were devoid of people. The president and his daughter stopped several times, and on the orders of photographers, looked this way and that for what was considered the hallmark image of his India trip.</p>
        <p>The White House used the opportunity to make a political point at the Taj Mahal, where pollution is threatening the marble sheen of the dome and minarets. In an outdoor speech afterward, with the Taj as a backdrop, Mr. Clinton pledged to help India reduce greenhouse emissions and encourage energy conservation.</p>
        <p>But nuclear weapons were the most intense subject of the Clinton visit. The public umbrage taken on Monday by the president of India, Kircheril Raman Narayanan, at Mr. Clinton's description of the subcontinent as the most dangerous place on earth, lent an extra tension to the differences between the United States and India as they tried to forge a new relationship. Mr. Clinton tried to defuse this strain by insisting in his address today that he was speaking as a friend who respected India's diversity, democracy and recent efforts at economic reform. And he posed the question that has often befuddled those who have just come to know India, and even those who have known it for ages.</p>
        <p>''From a distance, India often appears as a kaleidoscope of competing, perhaps superficial, images. Is it atomic weapons or ahimsa?'' he asked, referring to the message of nonviolence perpetuated by Mahatma Gandhi. ''A land struggling against poverty and inequality, or the world's largest middle-class society? Is it still simmering with communal tensions or history's most successful melting pot? Is it Bollywood or Satyajit Ray? Swetta Chetty or Alla Rakha? Is it the hand loom or the hyperlink?''</p>
        <p>The answer, Mr. Clinton said, was that ''no single image can possibly do justice to your great nation.'' He praised India's embrace of information technology. ''When Americans and other big software companies call for consumer and customer support, they're just as likely to find themselves talking to an expert in Bangalore as one in Seattle,'' he said to a round of applause. And he said he understood India's concern that the rules of the World Trade Organization advance ''the cause of social justice around the world.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Clinton tried hardest as he talked about India's nuclear strategy.</p>
        <p>''I can only speak to you as a friend about America's own experience during the cold war,'' he said. Despite direct dialogue with the former Soviet Union, a fair understanding of each other's intentions and very good spies on both sides, ''we came far too close to nuclear war.''</p>
        <p>One of Washington's major concerns about the standoff between India and Pakistan is the almost total lack of dialogue and the apparent belief in the two capitals, New Delhi and Islamabad, that possessing nuclear weapons is perhaps not all that dangerous.</p>
        <p>''We learned that deterrence alone cannot be relied on to prevent accident or miscalculation,'' Mr. Clinton said, as the chamber listened to this part of his speech attentively but largely silently. ''And in a nuclear standoff, there is nothing more dangerous than believing there is no danger.''</p>
        <p>The only passages of Mr. Clinton's nuclear appeal that won applause were his deference to India and the choice before the nation: ''Only India can determine its own interests. Only India can know if it truly is safer today than before the tests.'' He added: ''I do not presume to speak for you or to tell you what to decide.''</p>
        <p>Indian government officials have often chided the Clinton administration for what it calls its hypocrisy in telling another nation to give up nuclear weapons when the United States maintains a vast arsenal.</p>
        <p>Trying to deal with it head-on, Mr. Clinton said he was aware he was speaking on behalf of a nation that has possessed nuclear weapons for ''55 years and more.''</p>
        <p>But, he said, the United States has dismantled more than 13,000 nuclear weapons since 1988, helped Russia to dismantle its nuclear weapons and agreed to an outline of a treaty with Moscow that would reduce the remaining arsenals by half.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton followed his appeal on nuclear weapons with another appeal: for India to cast aside its misgivings and to take the initiative in beginning talks with Pakistan over Kashmir. ''I share many of your government's concerns about the course Pakistan is taking,'' the president said, referring to the military government that took power in October.</p>
        <p>But he suggested that India could afford to take the high road because unlike Pakistan, it is a democracy.</p>
        <p>''A special opportunity'' awaited India to ''show its neighbors that democracy is about dialogue,'' he said. ''It does not have to be about friendship.''</p>
