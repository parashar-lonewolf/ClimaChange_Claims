        <p>Keeping Calorie-Conscious  Many obesity experts are coming to believe that the only way for most people to control their weight is to be highly aware of food, planning their eating and planning exercise to burn off calories and never letting a day go by when what to eat and how much to eat and how much to exercise are not on their minds.</p>

        <p>Hillary Clinton's Vision Of U.S. Foreign Policy  Hillary Rodham Clinton called for the United States to reject isolationism and aggressively engage itself in world affairs in the tradition of President Harry S.

Her opponent, Rick A. Lazio, said her standard for intervention was too lax.</p>
