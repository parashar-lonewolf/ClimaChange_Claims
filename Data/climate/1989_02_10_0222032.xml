        <p>LEAD: The 193-page budget document the White House released tonight speaks of reshaping priorities, of reducing military spending and of new initiatives in education, environmental protection, shelter for the homeless and drug control.</p>
        <p>The 193-page budget document the White House released tonight speaks of reshaping priorities, of reducing military spending and of new initiatives in education, environmental protection, shelter for the homeless and drug control.</p>
        <p>But the charts and tables that give the actual spending figures show only fractional changes in the budget Ronald Reagan had already sent Congress for 1990. In his speech to Congress tonight, President Bush chose to stress the changes from the current fiscal year rather than from the Reagan proposal.</p>
        <p>The $1.16 trillion Mr. Bush proposed spending in the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, and the $91.1 billion deficit he calculated are almost exactly the same as the figures put forth by Mr. Reagan in his budget last month.</p>
        <p>As expected, Mr. Bush asked that the rise in military spending be no more than the amount needed to keep pace with inflation, a request $2 billion lower than Mr. Reagan's. But that is less than 1 percent of a Pentagon budget that exceeds $290 billion.  Forecast on Interest Rates</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush acknowledged that short-term interest rates in the current fiscal year, now well over 8 percent, are significantly higher than the 6.3 percent average for the year forecast by the Reagan Administration last November, and he adjusted his budget accordingly. But he continued to maintain that the average rates in the next fiscal year would be 5.5 percent.</p>
        <p>Congressional budget authorities and private economists are forecasting much higher interest rates, which would mean a higher cost to finance the national debt and, in turn, a larger deficit.</p>
        <p>At a news conference tonight, Richard G. Darman, the budget director, declared, ''If this program is enacted promptly, we believe there would be a significant and relatively rapid decline in interest rates.''</p>
        <p>Here are the main elements of Mr. Bush's budget proposal:  Military</p>
        <p>As expected, Mr. Bush cut the Reagan military spending request for the 1990 fiscal year by 1 percent. He trimmed the original $293.8 billion to $291.2 billion, keeping pace with the projected rate of inflation. For 1991 and 1992, he asked for increases of 1 percent over the rate of inflation, and he said that in 1993 he would seek a 2 percent increase after accounting for inflation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush put some noteworthy conditions on his agreement to hold military spending increases in 1990 to the inflation rate.</p>
        <p>He said the savings must all go to his other budget initiatives, leaving it unclear how his cuts in military outlays would help reduce the budget deficit. And he gave the Pentagon 60 days to tell him how to cut the military budget while still proceeding with a program to modernize the nation's long-range nuclear weapons, including the expensive and technologically troubled strategic bomber program.</p>
        <p>He said that nonnuclear weapons must continue to be upgraded and that despite the spending restraints, the armed services must maintain stockpiles of munitions, training regimens and the higher pay rates and other benefits that have led to ''the successes of the recent past in recruiting and retaining high-quality military personnel.''  Taxes</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's most striking tax proposal was for a reduction in capital gains taxation, which he said would increase revenue by $4.8 billion in the next fiscal year. The President also proposed a tax credit to help poor families pay the cost of child care; a tax deduction to offset the cost of adoption; $500 million in tax incentives to encourage oil and gas exploration, and other incentives to revitalize slum neighborhoods through business development.  Education</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush proposed a substantial increase in spending for Head Start, the preschool program for poor children, and he called for new programs to reward successful schools, recognize superior teachers, create a national scholars program and foster magnet schools. Altogether, the new programs would cost $58 million in the next fiscal year, but the President projected that the cost would rise to more than $500 million in four years.  Homelessness</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush would spend $644 million to help the homeless, $165 million more than Mr. Reagan suggested. As he promised in the campaign, he would fully finance legislation that allows the Government to use surplus Federal buildings to house the homeless. He also promised a $50 million initiative to help volunteers working with the homeless.  Drugs</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush suggested spending $5.96 billion on drug law enforcement and education, as against $5.14 billion recommended in the Reagan budget. But the amount is less than the $6.5 billion in funding put forth in the legislation Congress approved last year.</p>
        <p>Unlike the Reagan proposals, Mr. Bush called for spending $150 million to help state and local police fight drugs.  Environment</p>
        <p>The tone of the Bush budget is strongly environmental, and several objectives are a departure from those of the Reagan Administration. But it would provide hardly any more more money than what Mr. Reagan proposed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush called for a new Clean Air Act, including provisions to reduce pollution that causes acid rain. He also called for ''innovative'' solutions to clean the air in the nation's cities, but warned against ''draconian'' limits on the use of automobiles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush promised to delay leasing large tracts of the Outer Continental Shelf off California and Florida for oil drilling, a departure from Reagan policy. But he said that in general offshore oil and gas development was essential for the nation's economic security.  Health</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush would reduce spending for Medicare, the health program for the elderly, by about $5 billion below what it will be if no changes are made in the law. That is the same figure suggested by Mr. Reagan. But the new President canceled Mr. Reagan's proposed $1.5 billion cut in Medicaid, the health program for the poor, and asked that it be expanded to pay for care of pregnant women whose incomes are slightly above the amount that would ordinarily make them eligible. Mr. Bush also proposed spending an extra $800 million for child nutrition, rejecting Mr. Reagan's suggestion that subsidized school lunches be available only to the poorest students.  Nuclear Pollution</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush asked Congress to appropriate an additional $360 million to clean up pollution at plants that make nuclear weapons, and he said he would spend about $225 million of that in the next fiscal year. Some experts have placed the cost of cleanup and modernization at these plants at more than $100 billion over the next several years.  Retirement</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush proposed no changes in the Social Security program and said its beneficiaries should continue to get yearly increases to keep pace with inflation. But like Mr. Reagan, he proposed a one-year freeze in cost-of-living raises for people receiving Federal military and civilian pensions.  Science</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush emphasized continued space exploration and construction of the superconducting super collider, the 53-mile oval atom smasher proposed for Texas. He also proposed to increase funds for the National Science Foundation and the science programs of the Energy Department.</p>
