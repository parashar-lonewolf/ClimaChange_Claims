        <p>By long tradition whose roots seem opaque, the season for shooting grouse on Britain's heathery moorland begins each year on what is called ''the glorious 12th'' of August. For some -- and not just the grouse, to whom glory might be an elusive concept -- the season will not be so glorious this year.</p>
        <p>For two years, grouse populations have been under threat from worms and weather, although, on this stretch of 11,000 acres of rolling purple upland in north Yorkshire, the chief gamekeeper, Jimmy Shuttlewood, reckons his clients will do pretty well. (At upward of $4,900 a day for the privilege of hunting the fleet-winged, 80-mile-an-hour birds -- Lagopus lagopus scoticus, to give them their scientific name -- the shooters' hopes for a plentiful bag may seem justified.)</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, though, stocks are way down after what conservationists call a crash in 2005 when some populations of grouse fell by 95 percent, according to David Baines, a scientist from the not-for-profit Game Conservancy Trust. It was, he said, ''an all-time low.'' Indeed, said Simon Bostock, chairman of the Moorland Association, a group representing the owners of grouse moors, 2005 was ''a disaster for the grouse.''</p>
        <p>This year, the Moorland Association said in a statement, ''the most optimistic reports from the hills suggest estates will operate only one out of every four days shooting'' in the season, which runs from Aug. 12 to Dec. 10. ''But this represents an increase of nearly 50 percent from last year's severe crash.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, ''for many grouse moors, there may well be little or no grouse shooting again this year'' to permit breeding stocks to recover, the association said.</p>
        <p>If grouse are recovering, it might seem something of a mini-miracle, considering the threats -- quite apart from the hunters -- that face the red grouse, a species unique to Britain.</p>
        <p>First of all, there are predators -- foxes, crows and weasels. Ticks can be something of a problem, too. Then, consider the climate and the question that preoccupies many people: has global warming changed the climate forever, not just melting ice caps but also threatening birds on British moors?</p>
        <p>Mild, wet winters, for instance, encourage the proliferation of a parasite called the strongyle worm, which lodges in the grouse's intestines. Then, come spring, grouse like warm, dry weather to breed. This year brought rain, ''some of it torrential,'' that washed away many nests, Mr. Bostock said. Still, summer looked a little better, until July, when the heat wave came.</p>
        <p>By late July, ''the moors had been tinder dry for days and devastating moorland fires'' broke out, Mr. Bostock said. To make matters worse, a warning system seems to have failed to deliver the requisite warning. At one point, he said, the system indicated ''lower levels'' on the fire-hazard scale ''even though the moor was ablaze.''</p>
        <p>For the survivors among the birds, the beginning of the shooting season may seem anticlimactic.</p>
        <p>Usually, according to Mr. Baines, the scientist, grouse populations swell and shrink on a five-year cycle. When the grouse are abundant, their large populations are prone to parasites that reduce them to lesser numbers. The cycle, therefore, depends on cold winters that wipe out the parasites.</p>
        <p>''It is a concerning trend that there have been 10 or 15 years of mild, wet winters,'' Mr. Baines said. ''So many would suppose that it's a symptom of broader climatic change.''</p>
        <p>Historically, of course, grouse shooting has been seen as the preserve of the upper crust -- aristocrats in plus-four tweed breeches lofting matching Purdey shotguns from their blinds as local residents act as beaters, driving the birds into the open.</p>
        <p>''Grouse shooting is elitist, there's no getting around that,'' said James Chapel, who manages an estate on Snilesworth Moor, northeast of York, on behalf of an American owner, Bob Cieslukowski. ''Whether it's still the British aristocracy, I think it's less and less, but that's a reflection on society as a whole.''</p>
        <p>These days, though, he suggested in an interview, the principal threats to grouse are poor management and lack of investment in the measures needed to preserve heather -- the main diet of adult grouse -- from encroachment by bracken and to protect grouse from predators. By managing the moors, Mr. Chapel and others said, other species like curlew, golden plover and lapwing also prosper.</p>
        <p>In some ways, Mr. Chapel acknowledged, private landowners have been inconvenienced by government measures in recent years to open up vast areas of nonagricultural land to public access, permitting ordinary people -- and sometimes animals rights protesters -- to venture onto terrain that was once the closed preserve of the wealthy.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't say there isn't a conflict'' with people seeking free access to moorland, Mr. Chapel said. But, he said, moors could nonetheless be closed to public access during the grouse's nesting season in May and on shooting days, when stewards warn hikers to stay clear of the guns.</p>
        <p>On those days, the hunters assemble and are allocated to their blinds, spaced about 100 yards apart in a line across the moorland. Each is accompanied by a loader to keep the guns loaded and to ensure safety to avoid hunting accidents.</p>
        <p>Then, with dogs in tow, the beaters press forward and the flankers move in from the side to oblige the birds to fly toward the waiting guns. Once the beaters come within 200 yards, said Mr. Shuttlewood, the gamekeeper, a horn is blown to ensure that the hunters do not aim their guns toward the beaters.</p>
        <p>Most hunters, Mr. Chapel said, ''do have a certain knowledge of what's required of them'' in such potentially hazardous circumstances and do not simply blaze away. ''You tend not to get the Wild Bill Hickok effect,'' he said.</p>
