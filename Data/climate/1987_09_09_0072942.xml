        <p>LEAD: Environmentalists said today that the Reagan Administration was trying to undermine a pending international agreement to limit production levels of the man-made chemicals believed to be destroying the earth's ozone layer.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists said today that the Reagan Administration was trying to undermine a pending international agreement to limit production levels of the man-made chemicals believed to be destroying the earth's ozone layer.</p>
        <p>A Reagan Administration official said the charge was untrue and insisted the United States was working for the strongest possible agreement.</p>
        <p>Officials from industrialized nations are meeting in Montreal to work out the details of a protocol that would keep worldwide production of chlorofluorcarbons at 1986 levels. Under a tentative agreement, production of the chemicals, widely used for refrigeration, plastics and in electronics production, would later be halved.</p>
        <p>When they float up to the stratosphere, chlorofluorocarbons are believed to destroy ozone, which protects the earth from the sun's ultraviolet radiation.</p>
        <p>David Wirth, who is observing the Montreal meeting for the Natural Resources Defense Counsel, a private environmental group, said the United States was trying to ''torpedo'' the protocol with a provision to give any of the major producing countries the power to block the agreement. He said the proposal says the freeze on production levels would not take effect until countries that produce at least 90 percent of the world's chlorofluorcarbons have signed.</p>
