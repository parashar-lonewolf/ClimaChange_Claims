        <p>What's killing the mourning doves of New York?</p>
        <p>Until this year, that was a question that no one had even thought to ask, because no one knew that a scourge was stalking the dove population. Their struggle, like much death in the wild, was silent and offstage, in the woods and fields, where bodies quickly disappear and biologists are usually not on hand to take notes.</p>
        <p>But examinations of the 9,000-odd bird carcasses and 1,000 mammals and amphibians that were delivered this year to the state wildlife pathology lab here in response to the outbreak of West Nile virus changed all that. The corpses, from hummingbirds and loons to bats and mourning doves and even a few bears, arrived like a daily tide as public health officials around the state scrambled to investigate the unknown sources and transmission patterns of the virus, which emerged in the New York City region in the summer of 1999.</p>
        <p>And while testing for West Nile remained the top priority, said Ward B. Stone, the wildlife pathologist who directs the lab, new questions and clues kept piling up, too, along with the bodies. The result was a purely accidental scientific payoff from the emergence of West Nile -- a vast new database of wildlife death.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stone's lab, nestled in a rural region near Albany, has become one of the nodes, scientists say, of a swirling national confluence of disciplines -- from climatology to epidemiology -- that is drawing a tighter and tighter connection between human health and the state of the natural world.</p>
        <p>''Ward's lab is unique,'' said Linda Glaser, a wildlife disease specialist at the National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wis. She said Mr. Stone was finding out more about what was killing wildlife than anybody else in the United States. ''It's pretty amazing.''</p>
        <p>Most of the mourning doves did not die from the West Nile virus, the lab found, but rather from a protozoan parasite causing trichomoniasis, which caused lesions in the birds' throats. The disease cannot be transmitted from birds to humans, but it is deadly to doves. Other tests have turned up a dissertation's worth of avian ills, from fatal fungi to gastrointestinal tapeworm to what Mr. Stone says is a substantial number of deliberate poisonings that the state would never have known about without the flood of specimens sent in for testing for the West Nile virus.</p>
        <p>But what the examinations did not turn up is probably as revealing as what they did: in all the huge volume of specimens this year, relatively few animals, the lab found, died from accidental pesticide exposure. The great specter that has haunted the naturalist/environmental movement since at least the 1960's, when Rachel Carson published her polemic against agricultural toxins, ''Silent Spring,'' is waning, Mr. Stone said.</p>
        <p>Most of the small number of birds that were killed by manufactured poisons, he said, either ingested a chemical that is no longer in use but is still in the ecosystem, like chlordane, or ate poison recently set out by humans. A flock of dead gulls found near a landfill in Cortland, for example, was initially thought to have been killed by West Nile; it turned out the gulls had been fed an obscure poison laced into bread.</p>
        <p>''We're moving from a phase when pesticides like DDT and chlordane were the great threats to wildlife into a time when exotic diseases are becoming more and more important,'' Mr. Stone said. On the other hand, he said, some maladies that are turning up, like trichomoniasis, may have been killing mourning doves for years, perhaps even centuries, and no one knew. ''And we still wouldn't know it if we weren't hooked up with the Health Department and getting this volume of birds,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Other scientists say that New York's lab -- though it was not created for the purpose of tracking West Nile -- has provided a major, fortuitous link in the chain of disease investigation. A recent discovery here that bats are susceptible to West Nile, for example, has already filtered through the research world, prompting wildlife officials in New Jersey and other states to expand their testing and open their freezers to test old samples. Most states that have begun testing animals since the West Nile outbreak, which killed seven people last year and sickened dozens, still test only for West Nile.</p>
        <p>''New York is unusual because the program is set up to look for trends in wildlife diseases -- few other states put any money into that,'' said Tom French, the assistant director of the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife.</p>
        <p>But for all its clout and reputation, the pathology lab is neither large nor plush. It has a staff of five, including two technicians who were hired this year to do nothing but bird necropsies to test for West Nile. It has banks of freezers for storage, and perhaps most important, its own specially built high-temperature crematory to dispose of biohazard organisms.</p>
        <p>Before West Nile crowded its agenda, the lab worked on diseases like rabies and Lyme disease, and on issues like lead poisoning in waterfowl that accidentally ate lead sinkers lost by fishermen.</p>
        <p>Inside the lab, nature and death and technology are intertwined. Rows of animal skulls, from wolves to field mice, line the display cases. Student interns sit in front of computer screens, entering data, while in the basement, technicians in head-to-toe protective gear dissect birds, calling out their findings about the relative condition of spleens and livers and hearts and brains to assistants with clipboards.</p>
        <p>But researchers in other states say that all the public and government focus on West Nile and the volume of birds being turned in for examination throughout the Northeast have created scientific bonuses outside New York, as well. Wildlife investigators in New Jersey, for example, are now conducting what they say may be the largest-ever study in the nation about the lingering effects of chlordane.</p>
        <p>The chemical was banned in the late 1980's, but scientists and environmentalists have long maintained that because of its persistence -- it can remain toxic in the soil for decades after its application -- chlordane is probably still a factor in the ecosystem, passing from soil to insects to birds that eat insects and into birds that eat other birds.</p>
        <p>The New Jersey study, which looks at predatory species like hawks and falcons, had already been planned for this year, with perhaps a tiny sample and a big hypothesis, said Dr. Douglas E. Roscoe, the supervisor of the office of fish and wildlife health and forensics at the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife. The bounty of dead raptors that began arriving this summer for West Nile testing -- more than 70 hawks and falcons alone -- created a broad sampling that he could have only dreamed of, he said.</p>
        <p>Many other scientists say the biggest long-term impact on science from the emergence of the West Nile virus could result from the cross-fertilization of disciplines that it is bringing about. Because West Nile involves a kind of biological Where's Waldo of birds, mosquitoes, humans and other mammals, a new dialogue is beginning to emerge between specialists who have in many instances had little to say to one another. Doctors and public health administrators are talking to wildlife biologists; veterinarians are talking to ecologists who study the evolving disease patterns caused by climate change and global warming.</p>
        <p>Even pet shop owners and animal importers have become involved, as investigators pursue the theory that the virus entered the United States in the blood of an imported bird that  was then bitten by a mosquito that flew off to infect other birds.</p>
        <p>''There's a ton of stuff out there that we're only in the primitive stages of understanding,'' said Mark Pokras, the director of the wildlife clinic at the Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine in Medford, Mass., which formed a consortium two years ago with the Harvard Medical School and the Wildlife Trust, a private conservation group, to study emerging diseases. ''People are seeing the need to bring more expertise to bear because they realize that no area of the profession has a lock on the information.''</p>
        <p>Some of this scientific exchange had already been developing in places like Tufts as a result of other diseases and viruses that connect humans and animals, like the hantavirus, with its connection to rodents; Lyme disease, with its links to ticks and deer; and H.I.V., which has been traced to monkeys. West Nile is different, researchers say, because it is concentrated in the most densely populated region of North America and because, unlike those viruses and diseases, it also poses a grave danger to wildlife.</p>
        <p>''West Nile will be the real catalyst'' of interdisciplinary cooperation, said Dr. Paul R. Epstein, the associate director of the Center for Health and Global Environment at Harvard Medical School. ''It's getting veterinarians and doctors and biologists to sit down at the same table.''</p>
        <p>West Nile has become quiescent now, as cold weather has killed the mosquitoes that carry the virus. But that has meant only a shifting of the gears at the pathology lab, not really a rest. Blood smears and tissue samples that were put on ice during the hectic days of summer will be analyzed through the winter. An expansion of the lab to double its space for animal autopsies next year is also in the planning stage.</p>
        <p>And there are always new mysteries to solve. Loons have been washing up on the shores of Lake Erie recently, killed by botulism. Mr. Stone's hypothesis is that heavier-than-normal precipitation flushed local sewage systems into the lake, and that from there toxins passed into the tissues of zebra mussels and fish, and from there into the birds.</p>
        <p>Human beings who hunt and eat waterfowl from the lake are the next link in the chain, but Mr. Stone said a little home-economics science is all that is needed to keep the disease from spreading to humans: people should cook anything from the wild completely before they eat it.</p>
