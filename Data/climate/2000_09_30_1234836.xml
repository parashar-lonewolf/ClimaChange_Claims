        <p>This is a new 30-second commercial that the Lazio campaign planned to begin broadcasting last night.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- The Murphy Pintak Gautier Hudome Agency</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- Gov. George E. Pataki narrates this commercial, the first advertisement he has done for Representative Rick A. Lazio of Long Island in his bid for Senate. The ad was released yesterday as the governor, in a rare campaign appearance, joined Mr. Lazio upstate, but the ad does not include shots of the two on the campaign trail. Instead, Mr. Pataki, dressed in a suit and tie, speaks to the camera, with the static scenery of an office behind him. In one shot, Mr. Lazio and Mr. Pataki sit side-by-side reviewing papers and talking as the governor continues narrating. The commercial ends with the signature Lazio campaign shot: he and his wife, Patricia, walking with their two girls on a beach.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- ''For eight years Congressman Rick Lazio has fought and delivered for New York. Today more than a half million New York children have comprehensive health insurance because Rick Lazio delivered. He's fought hard to clean up New York's air and water and Long Island Sound. Rick's economic plan will cut taxes on working families, creating good jobs in every corner of New York State. We need Rick Lazio and his experience working for New York in the Senate. You can trust him to work for you. Rick Lazio.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Mr. Lazio voted for the comprehensive child health insurance program, supports legislation that would fight acid rain and has also sponsored legislation that provides $80 million a year to clean up the Sound. The Clinton campaign has noted that Mr. Lazio voted for cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency's budget and has voted against several environmental programs. In addition, he has proposed a tax plan that the Clinton campaign and others contend would cost nearly $1 trillion over 10 years.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- The advertisement aligns Mr. Lazio closely with Mr. Pataki, who remains popular among a majority of New Yorkers, particularly upstate, where Mr. Lazio is surprisingly not doing as well as Republicans should to win a statewide race. Like Mr. Pataki when he first ran for governor, Mr. Lazio is trying to gain statewide recognition and persuade Democrats and independents to vote for him in a heavily Democratic state. But the ad, which uses Mr. Pataki's stature as a two-term governor, risks overshadowing Mr. Lazio with the governor's commanding presence.</p>
