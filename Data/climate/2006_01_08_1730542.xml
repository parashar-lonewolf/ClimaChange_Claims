        <p>IF you can't resist a two-for-one deal, you may want to visit the 2006 North American International Auto Show.</p>
        <p>But which show?</p>
        <p>One features small cars and efficient car-based wagons. It suggests that wanton consumption of fossil fuels is out of fashion.</p>
        <p>The other, taking place simultanenously under the same blocks-long Cobo Center roof, offers proof that old habits die hard, that thirsty big trucks and insanely powerful cars are not yet historical relics.</p>
        <p>Press previews begin today; the show opens to the public next Saturday and runs through Jan. 22.</p>
        <p>After a year in which gasoline prices shot up and S.U.V. sales softened, several automakers have turned their spotlights on fuel-efficient small cars, car-based utility wagons and new hybrid powertrains.</p>
        <p>But as in past years, new trucks and S.U.V.'s will make their debuts -- these remain among the most profitable products in a troubled industry -- but even some of those will be dressed in green, as platforms for alternative fuels and advanced propulsion systems both real and hypothetical.</p>
        <p>In Detroit, power still plays to a packed house. In a replay of the mid-1960's, Chrysler and General Motors are expected to respond to Ford's successful Mustang with design studies for their own reborn pony cars. Chrysler will revive a nameplate, Imperial, traditionally reserved for its largest, grandest automobiles.</p>
        <p>But Honda and Nissan are coming to Detroit with two tiny ''B segment'' cars, a size common in Japan but virtually unknown in the United States. Honda will soon begin selling the Fit, known in some countries as the Jazz. Smaller and less expensive than the Civic, the Fit will compete against a new Toyota, the Yaris, which will also be on display. Nissan will offer its own B-car, the Versa, which fits beneath the compact Sentra. A redesigned Sentra will be unveiled, giving Nissan two new cars below $20,000.</p>
        <p>The Chrysler Group will show its replacement for the Neon subcompact; the Dodge Caliber comes only as a sporty five-door hatchback. The Caliber also represents the debut of Chrysler's new global four-cylinder engine, designed to be more fuel-efficient, and will be offered with a fuel-saving continuously variable transmission.</p>
        <p>Jeep will make a version of the Caliber called the Compass, which will be the division's first car-based vehicle and the first Jeep not designed for serious off-roading.</p>
        <p>Consumer demand has been brisk for the car-based utility wagons known as crossovers, and several automakers are responding with new versions of these lighter, more efficient alternatives to S.U.V.'s. Among the new crossovers in Detroit are the Acura RDX, Buick Enclave, Ford Edge and Lincoln MKX (previously called the Aviator).</p>
        <p>Hyundai will show the second generation of its Santa Fe crossover, which goes into production this year in Alabama, and the latest design for a sporty coupe, the HCD9 Talus. Hyundai's Kia subsidiary will show a sporty crossover design study, the Soul.</p>
        <p>Recognizing that this may not be the best time to roll out full-size truck-based S.U.V.'s, General Motors is putting a green sheen on its redesigned Chevrolet Tahoe by displaying a hybrid version with a powertrain developed in cooperation with DaimlerChrysler and BMW. The hybrid Tahoe goes on sale next year as a 2008 model.</p>
        <p>Toyota will try to reinforce its image as a hybrid leader when it introduces its fifth dual-power model (including two from the Lexus division), a version of the next-generation Camry sedan. Lexus will show the fourth generation of its flagship LS sedan.</p>
        <p>Hybrid hoopla has largely supplanted talk of electric cars, but Mitsubishi will give a glimpse of what it calls the next generation of electric vehicles. Said to be close to production, the Concept-CT MIEV is a sporty design study of a B-segment car that uses Mitsubishi's in-wheel electric technology; power is delivered by four electric motors, one at each wheel.</p>
        <p>At Ford, Mark Fields will take a bow as president for the Americas and try to get the struggling company back on track. [SundayBusiness, Section 3.] Ford will show a small, sporty concept car, the Reflex, that has two front seats and a rear area that can fit one adult, two children or an infant car seat. In concept form, the Reflex has a hybrid powertrain that, in theory, can travel up to 65 miles on a gallon of diesel fuel.</p>
        <p>The Chrysler Division will show its first true S.U.V., the Aspen, based on the Dodge Durango. Jeep will unveil an all-new Wrangler, the granddaddy of S.U.V.'s. Mercedes-Benz will introduce a new large S.U.V., the seven-seat GL-Class, to be built at the company's Alabama plant.</p>
        <p>Retro, a theme in vogue at many recent Detroit shows, is back again. G.M. is expected to dust off the Chevrolet Camaro name for a sporty design study. A production version may reach market by 2010.</p>
        <p>In a similar vein, Dodge will resurrect a name from its past with the Challenger concept car. Based on the Chrysler 300 and equipped with a Hemi engine, the Challenger appears close to production.</p>
        <p>The 300 sedan also provides a foundation for the Imperial concept car. But while the 300 has overtones of classic Bentleys, the Imperial captures the haughty, ostentatious mien of the Rolls-Royce Phantom.</p>
        <p>For the first time, a Chinese automaker will display cars in Detroit. Geely, a privately held Chinese company, will have an exhibit during the media previews; it plans to sell cars through a Puerto Rico-based distributor by the end of the decade.</p>
