        <p>The Atlantic Richfield Company announced a preliminary agreement yesterday to sell its large coal business in the United States to a unit of Beacon Group, a New York investment firm that would become the second-biggest coal operator in the country with the purchase.</p>
        <p>ARCO said all principal terms and conditions had been negotiated, but a binding agreement had not been completed. It did not disclose terms, but a source close to the bidding said ARCO had sought about $1.6 billion.</p>
        <p>ARCO, a major oil company based in Los Angeles, put its coal business up for sale last year as part of a broader strategy to focus on exploration for other sources of petroleum because of dwindling supplies at its field in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. ARCO  said it would use the proceeds of the coal sale for that purpose.</p>
        <p>For Beacon's Alliance Coal Corporation, the deal represents a bet that coal will remain a critical source of fuel for generating electricity despite the emission of carbon dioxide from burning coal, which has been blamed for global warming.</p>
        <p>As part of the transaction, ARCO said Alliance would get an unspecified investment from the Texas Pacific Group, a firm known for investing in underperforming businesses. That is the second big deal in a week for Texas Pacific, which agreed to invest $350 million in Oxford Health Plans a few days earlier.</p>
        <p>Alliance Coal, which already owns mines in the Midwest and East, would expand into three Western states with the addition of ARCO Coal, which is based in Denver.</p>
        <p>ARCO has two mines in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and one mine in Colorado. It also owns three mines in Utah in partnership with the Itochu Corporation of Japan.</p>
        <p>The mines in Wyoming, known as Black Thunder and Coal Creek, are considered two of the most productive and profitable mines in the region.</p>
        <p>Two other companies, the Kennecott Energy and Coal Company, which has spent about $1 billion since 1990 buying up coal assets, and Arch Coal Inc., had been interested in buying the ARCO mines. Kennecott Energy is a subsidiary of RTZ-CRA.</p>
        <p>Last year all of the ARCO mines in the United States produced 53.2 million tons of coal. With such added production, Alliance would become the largest producer in the United States behind the Peabody Coal Company.</p>
        <p>About 50 percent of the electricity in the United States is generated by burning coal. Coal is also one of the lowest-cost fuels and is cheap to mine in the Powder River Basin, where tons of it at a time are scooped into rail cars. The coal is then delivered to utilities in the West and Midwest.</p>
        <p>Some companies are betting that despite attempts at the summit meeting on global warming in Kyoto, Japan, last December to limit carbon dioxide emissions, coal use will increase.</p>
        <p>As states deregulate their utilities the demand for inexpensive electricity from coal-fired plants is expected to rise.</p>
        <p>Alliance, through its subsidiary, Mapco Coal Inc., owns and operates eight coal mines in Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland and Virginia.</p>
