        <p>LEAD: DISLIKED by doctors, car owners and environmentalists, salt is a substance that even Biblical writers suggested should ''be cast out'' and ''trodden under the foot of men.'' But with winter less than a month away, most commuters will be grateful for the salt that is now appearing in conical domes throughout the county, ready to be cast on the roads by highway departments.</p>
        <p>DISLIKED by doctors, car owners and environmentalists, salt is a substance that even Biblical writers suggested should ''be cast out'' and ''trodden under the foot of men.'' But with winter less than a month away, most commuters will be grateful for the salt that is now appearing in conical domes throughout the county, ready to be cast on the roads by highway departments.</p>
        <p>As bridges and automobiles corrode, vegetation dies and salt seeps into reservoirs and wells, some highway officials believe they may have found an alternative to road salt.</p>
        <p>This winter the International Business Machines research center in Yorktown Heights will become the first Westchester site to test calcium magnesium acetate, a chemical alternative whose 10-year development has been sponsored by the Federal Highway Department. Oppenheimer Seeks State Test</p>
        <p>Officials at I.B.M. said last week that they learned about the experimental product from State Senator Suzi Oppenheimer, Democrat of New Rochelle. She is co-sponsoring legislation in Albany to develop a state-financed test of calcium magnesium acetate as an alternative to road salt.</p>
        <p>Saying that salt caused more than $1 billion of damage in New York State last year, Mrs. Oppenheimer said her concern about salt dated to her time as Mayor of Mamaroneck. ''Everything on the road was eaten up, bridges were damaged and the pipes from the storm sewers were corroded,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Expressing pleasure about I.B.M.'s decision to test the new substance, Mrs. Oppenheimer added: ''We will still proceed with the legislation. But getting a private corporation to take the lead is just great.''</p>
        <p>I.B.M. will monitor the use of calcium magnesium acetate on its sidewalks and parking lots and report its findings to Senator Oppenheimer's office.</p>
        <p>''We are going to try it, no question about it,'' said Frederick Cox, the facilities operations manager at the Yorktown site. But he added, ''It sure is expensive. The cost almost blew my mind.'' One Ton Costs $650</p>
        <p>While road salt costs between $25 and $25 a ton, the new substance, a mixture of limestone and acidic acid, sells for $650 a ton.</p>
        <p>I.B.M.'s salt problem is ''no worse than anyone's,'' Mr. Cox said, but ''we are all looking for alternatives to get rid of road salt.''</p>
        <p>For the last two years calcium magnesium acetate has been manufactured for the Federal Highway Administration by the Chevron Corporation, following the completion of nearly a decade of study to determine its acceptability as an alternative to road salt.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Chevron Corporation called the difference in price for its product and road salt ''very significant.'' Use of New Mixture Is Rising</p>
        <p>It ''will not become a widespread substitute for road salt in the short term,'' acknowledged Jeff D. Wyatt, marketing manager for the de-icing chemicals project group at Chevron, in an interview last week.</p>
        <p>But the use of calcium magnesium acetate in salt-sensitive areas is already increasing, Mr. Wyatt said. This winter, for example, New York City officials plan to use it on the city's badly corroded Williamsburg Bridge. Departments of Transportation in California, West Virginia and Michigan are also planning to use the substance in environmentally sensitive areas, Mr. Wyatt added.</p>
        <p>Officials of the Adirondack park preserve have told Chevron that they are interested in using the new mixture, Mr. Wyatt said, because they hope the chemical may retard the damage done by acid rain. Calcium magnesium acetate can help raise the alkaline content of the soil, he explained.</p>
        <p>This growing interest in the product follows the release last spring of the latest study of the mixture. The study concluded that the substance is biodegradable and that it has little effect on the environment.</p>
        <p>''CMA actually benefits roadside soils,'' Mr. Wyatt said, ''since it improves permeability and adds calcium and magnesium leached out by road salt.''</p>
        <p>He acknowledged that there were ''a couple of open questions'' about the mixture, including its potential to reduce the oxygen content of water. Chevron is sponsoring research on this through the Hydro-Qual Center at Manhattan College, Mr. Wyatt said. Municipal Officials Have Questions</p>
        <p>The Westchester Association of Municipal Public Works Administrators, whose 89 members include nearly all the public works administrators in the county, have questions about calcium magnesium acetate, as well. Its president, Lawrence S. Black has written to Senator Oppenheimer on behalf of the association, seeking more information about a product that he said he believed has not been thoroughly tested.</p>
        <p>''We discussed CMA at our last monthly meeting,'' Mr. Black said. ''A number of our members were concerned about the kind of gases that might be emitted when a combination of calcium and magnesium hits metal. We are waiting for an answer from the Senator.''</p>
        <p>Although using road salt is not a perfect solution, Mr. Black said, it has so far proved better than any alternative tried. The municipal salt trucks, for example, do corrode from salt, he said, but preventive maintenance can make a big difference. Safe Storage Is Expensive</p>
        <p>One of the largest problems the association cites is the inability of some Westchester municipalities to pay for environmentally safe storage, which can cost $250,000.</p>
        <p>New Castle is among the towns that have elected to build one of the new dome-shaped storage containers. Completed in 198l, the upper part of the structure is nearly 85 feet in diameter and is made of plywood. The lower section is concrete. The concrete floor is surrounded by a blacktop ring to prevent salt runoff and pollution of the environment, explained Gerard C. Moerschell, the town's Commissioner of Public Works.</p>
        <p>Large piles of sand are also stocked and mixed with the salt, Mr. Moerschell said, ''as we know a straight salt mix could cause environmental problems.'' Town Facing Two Suits</p>
        <p>North Salem has not built special storage for its road salt, despite being urged to do so by it Public Works Department. The town is involved in two separate lawsuits, brought by residents who claimed their drinking-water supplies had been polluted by salt.</p>
        <p>Since the two legal actions began in l985, the town has taken steps to reduce its use of salt and has eliminated the use in two environmentally sensitive areas. One of those areas is a quarter-mile section of Bog Town Road, which lies in a low area.</p>
        <p>''We just sanded, and we got a lot of complaints,'' said Drew A. Outhouse, North Salem's Highway Superintendent.</p>
        <p>''Even though the area was well posted, there were more accidents than usual,'' he said. ''If people would just slow down a little, it would be no problem. But they want the same speed in February that they have in July, and you can't allow people to do that and not use salt.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Outhouse said he was eager to see the new calcium magnesium aceate tested, despite its cost. ''People think because we are the Highway Department that we love using salt,'' he said. ''Well, it eats up our trucks and you should see what it does to our gloves and boots.''</p>
