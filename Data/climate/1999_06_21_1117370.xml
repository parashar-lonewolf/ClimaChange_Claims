        <p>Al Gore has been trying to be more exciting on the stump -- trying so hard that if he keeps it up, he'll rupture his vocal cords before the New Hampshire primary.</p>
        <p>The new Al Gore yells quite a lot. Caught between Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, two natural campaigners, the Vice President is trying to make up in decibels what he lacks in spontaneity. ''I am not satisfied! INDEED I AM RESTLESS!'' he cried in New York, announcing his candidacy for President with a list of promises about what he would do to move the country TOWARD AMERICA'S NEW HORIZONS, a goal that will involve eliminating EVERY LAST DIME OF WASTE, fighting GLOBAL WARMING and making our public schools THE FINEST AND BEST IN THE ENTIRE WORLD.</p>
        <p>This is our fault. We have been carping about how boring Al Gore  is, and the poor man is all but howling at the moon in an effort to sound more compelling. We are being forced to watch him go through an enormous effort to look effortless, and it is as discomfiting as looking at the underside of a swan swimming on the lake. Voters are not going to elect a President who makes them feel like nervous parents at the second-grade class play. Mr. Gore has to give up this futile attempt to become Kennedyesque and embrace the boredom.</p>
        <p>Let Gore be Gore! Where is it written that the American people want a fun guy for President? Most of our chief executives were not people you would necessarily want to pal around with. No one ever accused George Washington of being the life of the party. ''Today I dined with the president, and as usual the company was as grave as if at a funeral,'' reported one of his supporters.</p>
        <p>Certainly it is a disadvantage to have to campaign in the age of mass media when the only TV star you resemble is Howdy Doody. But history shows that when America is in a period of economic boom, the public is comfortable having someone in the White House who is more stolid than the stock market. During the Roaring Twenties, the electorate fell in love with Calvin Coolidge, a monosyllabic politician who barely had the energy to get out of bed in the morning. (Coolidge was also, as far as we know, the first Vice President to serve while his boss was having sex with a woman not his wife in a room just off the Oval Office. He never felt compelled to point out that this was outrageous.)</p>
        <p>Unlike Coolidge, Al Gore is an energetic politician, and you only have to listen to his speeches to know that there will probably be A LOT OF INITIATIVES in a Gore administration. Even though George Bush has been gloriously unspecific about his own agenda, it is already easy to see that the two front-runners for the Presidential nominations have very different outlooks. Mr. Gore, for all his worries about BUREAUCRATIC EXCESS, is a government activist, and Mr. Bush, for all his talk about being a compassionate conservative, does not seem to really have many new initiatives in mind. The best way to describe the difference between them so far is that Mr. Gore promises to make ''high-quality preschool available to EVERY CHILD IN EVERY FAMILY'' and Mr. Bush promises to get the Head Start classes to teach phonics.</p>
        <p>The first time I saw Al Gore, he was running in the New York Democratic Presidential primary in 1988, a contest the Gore people thought they had wrapped up when they won the endorsement of Mayor Ed Koch. But Mr. Koch was in full-throttle third-term hysteria, having insulted or alienated almost every conceivable section of the city population. The Mayor led Mr. Gore around like a spaniel, and at almost every stop the Tennessee Senator was asked to apologize for something Mr. Koch had said or done to somebody. During that campaign Mr. Gore did not look so much stiff as numb, as if he had been knocked over the head with a bat.</p>
        <p>The second time I saw Mr. Gore was when he returned to Manhattan for an environmental conference. He was happy as a clam, discussing dire predictions of receding shores and expanding populations. Reading the text of his remarks would probably have been pretty boring then, too. But in person, Mr. Gore was utterly at ease with himself and his audience. Even his hair looked less stiff.</p>
        <p>Bob Olivari, who worked for  Mr. Gore in that fatal 1988 primary, claims his candidate was at his best in Staten Island, the home of the nation's largest landfill, where people were actually interested in hearing him talk about solid waste. ''He had a very good first day and then  it went downhill,'' recalled Mr. Olivari last week, at a fund-raising cocktail party for Mr. Gore in Manhattan. ''Maybe he should just try being who he is and things will work out.''</p>
        <p>Seize the moment, Mr. Gore. Dare to be dull.</p>
