        <p>New Jersey and eight other states filed a lawsuit yesterday challenging a new federal rule that they claim does not do enough to control dangerous mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants.</p>
        <p>Once released into the air, the mercury -- a byproduct of the burning of coal -- drifts over lakes and rivers where it is absorbed by fish and shellfish that are consumed by people. It is considered a potent neurotoxin that can cause brain damage, especially in infants and small children who are exposed to even a small amount.</p>
        <p>The suit is aimed at a new rule released by the Environmental Protection Agency earlier this month to exempt power plants from the most stringent controls for mercury emissions under Section 112 of the federal Clean Air Act.</p>
        <p>Instead of having to apply cutting-edge technology to reduce mercury, power plants will be given the option of using a system called cap and trade. Under that system, operators can purchase pollution credits from other plants that have managed to lower their mercury emissions below targeted levels.</p>
        <p>Cynthia Bergman, a public affairs officer for the agency, defended the new rule. ''The United States is the first country to regulate mercury emissions from power plants,'' she said.</p>
        <p>When they announced the new rule, federal officials insisted that a system of trading pollution credits would effectively lower the level of mercury in the air, just as a similar system has reduced emissions that cause acid rain.</p>
        <p>But the suit, filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, claims the new rule weakens the Clean Air Act, creates dangerous ''hot spots'' around plants that pollute the most, and prolongs exposure to one of the most hazardous materials in the air that millions of people breathe.</p>
        <p>''It is regrettable that now we find ourselves opposing an environmental agency whose singular goal is to protect the public health by insuring cleaner air, water and land,'' said Peter C. Harvey, the New Jersey attorney general who filed the lawsuit on behalf of the coalition of nine states.</p>
        <p>The suit charges that the new rule will reduce mercury emissions to 15 tons a year from the current level of 48 tons. Under the more rigorous controls of Section 112, mercury emissions would have been reduced to about five tons a year, according to the lawsuit.</p>
        <p>The new rule also pushes back deadlines for compliance to 2018 from 2008, with the controls not taking full effect until 2026.</p>
        <p>''Essentially what they're saying is we're going to allow more mercury emissions in the atmosphere than we could under the Clean Air Act, and I don't see that being pro-business so much as anti-public health,'' said Mr. Harvey.</p>
        <p>The power companies insist that mercury from their plants had to be reclassified and removed from the most stringent controls in order to make a cap-and-trade system work. And they said there would be no additional delays because once a cap-and-trade system is established, some operators will reduce emissions almost immediately.</p>
        <p>''Those facilities that can make cost-effective reductions early, so that they can generate credits that they can trade later, have a big incentive to do it quickly,'' said Scott H. Segal, director of the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, which represents power companies. He said that 30 percent of reductions achieved under the cap-and-trade system for acid rain emissions took place well before the first deadline.</p>
        <p>Mercury contamination is a serious problem, especially in the Northeast.</p>
        <p>Several mercury hot spots already have been identified in the region, and officials in New York, New Jersey and several other states have posted warnings against eating fish caught in lakes and rivers including those in wilderness areas of the Adirondacks. Last year, the New York State Department of Health listed 51 lakes, rivers and ponds where people were cautioned to severely limit -- or cut out altogether -- the consumption of fresh-caught fish.</p>
        <p>Besides New Jersey, the other states joining in the lawsuit are: California, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York and Vermont.</p>
