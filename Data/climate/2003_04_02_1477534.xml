        <p>Although he has played baseball for most of his life, Drew Gribbons, a 16-year-old second baseman, had never held a wood bat in his hands. But because a ruling has led scores of Massachusetts high schools to ban metal baseball bats, Gribbons stood at home plate a few days ago swinging -- for the first time -- a polished piece of lumber.</p>
        <p>Gribbons might as well have been handed a Civil War musket.</p>
        <p>''It stung my hands,'' Gribbons said with a look of bewilderment as he described wood meeting a baseball. ''And the ball didn't go anywhere.''</p>
        <p>Gribbons and most of his Auburn High School teammates are adjusting, even if it means aching hands and a loss of power. It is the rest of Massachusetts -- the first state to impose a wood-only rule after three decades of metal bat use at every level of youth baseball -- that is still in a state of bewilderment.</p>
        <p>The movement back to wood bats, required only for the postseason this year but put into practice at most schools for the entire season, was prompted by safety concerns and a grass-roots urge to return to basics. Part legislative and part voluntary, it has fostered an ardent debate pitting coaches against school administrators and bat manufacturers against sports safety advocates. At the same time, baseball purists have been uplifted to see a rare reversal in the advance of technology.</p>
        <p>The wood-versus-metal battle has evolved on philosophic and economic fronts, with entrenched camps disputing each other's data and motives, turning the discussion into something almost metaphysical, like the debate over global warming.</p>
        <p>There is evidence that several other states are watching this wood bat experiment closely, wondering if it will, or should, spread. In Massachusetts, a state that considers itself the birthplace of the American Revolution, the crack -- and not the ping -- of the bat might become the shot heard round the sports world.</p>
        <p>Or maybe not.</p>
        <p>''We've broken three wood bats in practice already,'' Paul Fenton, the baseball coach at Auburn High School for 29 years, said in a Boston accent thick with disdain. ''I'm sick of hearing about the crack of the bat. What if we run out of bats? Am I allowed to go into the other team's dugout and use their bats?''</p>
        <p>Origins of Safety Concerns</p>
        <p>Many trace the wood bat revolution in Massachusetts to a game in May 2001 in which Bill Hughto, a Wellesley High School pitcher, was struck in the temple by a line drive off a metal bat. Hughto had to be air-lifted by helicopter to a Boston hospital where he underwent emergency surgery for a clot on his brain. Although he was in a coma for days, Hughto recovered. His accident followed by several months another in eastern Massachusetts in which a high school pitcher sustained serious facial injuries when he was struck by a line drive off a metal bat.</p>
        <p>The injuries emboldened a small group of coaches and wood-bat advocates in the state to press their case for a wood-only rule in high school baseball. Metal bats, they contended, were endangering players because pitched baseballs came off metal bats so quickly that the players did not have time to react. The wood bat advocates also believed the added firepower of metal bats was distorting the game with too much offense, turning legions of .220 hitters into .320 hitters.</p>
        <p>Once referred to simply as aluminum bats -- and introduced because they did not break and, thus, saved youth baseball groups money -- metal bats are used by nearly everyone in baseball except Major League Baseball's players and minor leaguers. Metal bats are the choice of players in Little League Baseball and Softball, in high schools in 49 states, in the National Collegiate Athletic Association and in most recreational settings.</p>
        <p>Aluminum bats are now commonly made of alloys and other high-tech materials. Few people question that they are easier to hit with, especially on mis-hits, when contact with the baseball or softball is made near the bat's handle or at its end. Few also question that players can hit the ball farther with metal bats -- indeed, that is how most metal bats have been marketed for decades. Several years ago, metal bats were particularly juiced, taking advantage of a trampoline effect at contact. There has been an effort to inhibit that effect, with restrictions, testing and certification guidelines.</p>
        <p>More to the point, metal-bat proponents say, just because the baseball may go farther does not mean it injures more players in the field; they demand to see evidence that it does. In fact, there is no such irrefutable evidence, and organizations like Little League Baseball say injuries have diminished in the last 20 to 30 years, which has also been the growth period for metal bats.</p>
        <p>''It is not a safety issue at all,'' said Jim Darby, vice president for promotions of Easton Sports, which makes wood and metal bats, and is one of the three major manufacturers of metal bats. ''There are inherent risks to the sport, but aluminum bats are as safe as wood. We have data to back that up and everything else said about aluminum bats is anecdotal. In Massachusetts, they have no reason to force kids to use wood.''</p>
        <p>There has been no significant groundswell of opinion in the coaching ranks seeking change, although many college baseball coaches receive money and equipment from the bat companies. In Massachusetts, an informal survey by the state's baseball coaches association last year showed that 72 percent wanted to continue to use metal.</p>
        <p>But the baseball committee of the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association was not swayed. On Oct. 31, 2002, after five hours of contentious debate -- one speaker had to be ejected from the building -- the committee voted, 9 to 6, to prohibit the use of metal bats in the state high school baseball tournament this spring.</p>
        <p>Befitting the stormy nature of the issue, a number of public hearings and unexpected developments ensued. The state's sports medicine committee, which had originally recommended the switch to wood, reversed itself and concluded there was no safety risk associated with metal bats.</p>
        <p>A task force was set up to determine whether there was a compelling safety hazard to justify an emergency rule change outlawing metal bats immediately, to take effect at the beginning of the regular season. The task force voted overwhelmingly against that measure, then it turned around and narrowly voted in favor of a recommendation asking the state's interscholastic board of directors to ban metal bats in the 2004 regular season.</p>
        <p>That vote is scheduled for early May before the 17-member board of directors -- 16 of whom are principals or superintendents and not athletic department personnel.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, knowing that metal bats will be banned in postseason play this year, 21 Massachusetts baseball leagues voluntarily decided to switch to wood right away. Since four leagues had already voted to go to wood last season, that means 25 of the 40 Massachusetts high school leagues will be using wood when the season opens in early April.</p>
        <p>That has far from quieted the public debate. At one of the public hearings, a coach rose to say that players from Massachusetts using wood bats would have lower batting averages, putting them at a disadvantage in the competition for college baseball scholarships.</p>
        <p>A high school principal sitting on the panel overseeing the hearing responded, ''I was not aware that was the reason we played high school baseball.''</p>
        <p>Fiscal Concerns</p>
        <p>Other coaches said they feared financial difficulties if forced to use wood. The average high school team might have begun each season in the past by purchasing two metal bats at $250 each. Three dozen wood bats, an estimate for a full season, might cost $1,200.</p>
        <p>Wood-bat advocates countered that most high school players (or their parents) buy their own bats. They would be relieved to be purchasing two or even three wood bats at $45 each instead of a high-end metal bat for $300.</p>
        <p>Some baseball coaches who are proponents of metal bats insisted that potential players would grow frustrated trying to hit with wood and quit the game.</p>
        <p>''I'm worried about the future,'' said Frank Carey, the baseball coach at North Redding High School, who made an impassioned plea at the hearings. ''Kids have trouble with failure and metal makes it easier to hit. Nobody likes to hit .200.''</p>
        <p>Alex Campea, the baseball coach at Catholic Memorial High School in West Roxbury, suggested that wood bats would improve the quality of games. ''Those kids will also become better fielders and better bunters,'' Campea said. ''We will have 2-1 games with speed and strategy. It's not supposed to be about who hits it farthest. We had too many 15-12 games. Those are football scores.''</p>
        <p>Back and forth they have argued, with those supporting metal bats waving studies proving that there is no real hazard or reason to change. The wood-bat proponents tend to contest that evidence with a more empirical view, contending that a specially engineered modern metal bat must deliver more force to a baseball than old-fashioned wood. And on the face of that, they say, is it safe for fielders who are waiting 60 feet away?</p>
        <p>Bill Thurston, the baseball coach at Amherst College for nearly four decades, was for many years the rules editor of the N.C.A.A. baseball rules committee -- until he resigned three years ago, largely in protest over the association's unwillingness to vigorously examine metal bat safety. Thurston has compiled dozens of videotapes, mostly of pitchers being struck by batted balls -- teeth knocked out, jaws broken; the tapes were shown to Massachusetts officials until they felt compelled to cover their eyes.</p>
        <p>''The bat manufacturers say there is no way to prove that these players wouldn't have been hit if the batter had been swinging a wood bat instead,'' Thurston said. ''That's true. If I have a car accident going 70 miles an hour, I can't prove it wouldn't have happened if I were going 55 miles an hour. But I would like those chances.''</p>
        <p>For six years , Thurston has also done a statistical study of the Cape Cod League, where elite college players gather each summer in an all-star circuit that also serves as a showcase for major league scouts because the league uses only wood bats. Thurston has documented that players' batting averages in the league have declined an average of 91 points using wood bats, compared with their batting averages in their spring college season using metal bats. Home runs decreased by 61 percent and slugging percentage declined by an average of 190 points per player.</p>
        <p>''What happened, they got weaker in the summer?'' Thurston asked. ''No, the wood bat is tougher to get started and tougher to control.''</p>
        <p>At Auburn High School, which is near Worcester in central Massachusetts, Fenton, the baseball coach, would hardly disagree. ''But we don't use wood golf clubs anymore or peach baskets for the hoop in basketball, either,'' he said. ''We change as equipment improves.''</p>
        <p>In the town of Randolph, 12 miles south of Boston, Steve Connors, a high school pitcher and first baseman, is more comfortable with the rhythms and nuances of a game played with wood bats.</p>
        <p>''As a pitcher, when the bigger hitters were up with a metal bat, you thought about getting clobbered by a ball coming back at you,'' Connors said. ''Now, maybe the ball doesn't go as far, but then, the fielders come in and you play a different game. It's real baseball.''</p>
        <p>Down the road, at the athletic powerhouse Catholic Memorial, Campea, the baseball coach, said he had scheduled two wood-only games with teams from Rhode Island, where metal is still the standard. ''There is a lot of curiosity about this,'' Campea said. ''I think other states might follow Massachusetts.''</p>
        <p>Carey, the coach in North Redding, has received different feedback. ''I've gotten calls from coaches in Florida and Connecticut saying, 'What is wrong with you people up in Massachusetts?''' Carey said.</p>
        <p>In Auburn, the baseball players had grown accustomed to baseballs flying 400 feet from home plate into the high school parking lot. But batting practice now often brings a few line drives and mostly catchable fly balls, with the occasional shot over an outfielder's head. As a group, the players seem split on the shift to wood.</p>
        <p>''We're all equal now,'' first baseman Adam Abderrazzaq said. ''It's not the $350 bat hitting the ball, it's the player.''</p>
        <p>But Joe Germain, an outfielder, said: ''The wood is not for me. I liked going up there hacking. Not now.''</p>
        <p>Drew Gribbons, meanwhile, has acquired batting gloves that he laces tightly, although he was still shaking the vibration and sting from his hands whenever he swung his new wood bat and missed the sweet spot.</p>
        <p>''I'll get used to it,'' Gribbons said afterward, smiling. ''Well, hopefully. I've got all year.''</p>
