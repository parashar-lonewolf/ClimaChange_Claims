        <p>LAST month the New Orleans Times Picayune, Louisiana's most influential newspaper, called the American Cyanamid plant 20 miles upriver "the single largest polluting plant in the state." In October, the Louisiana Environmental Action Network, a Baton Rouge-based coalition of citizens groups, designated American Cyanamid its "polluter of the month," criticizing the company for being responsible for a quarter of the 740 million pounds of toxic chemicals discharged into Louisiana's environment in 1988.</p>
        <p>How did the newspaper and the environmental group know so much about American Cyanamid's toxic-waste record? They had access to its discharge data as a result of a five-year-old Federal law, the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act, which requires manufacturers to report the total amount of each of some 330 toxic chemicals that have been released into the air, water and land.</p>
        <p>The data, reported to the Environmental Protection Agency and to states, are listed in the annual Toxics Release Inventory, a compendium of the country's leading toxic-waste dischargers -- and a powerful tool for pressuring factories to reduce pollution.</p>
        <p>"It's been very empowering for local people to know who's polluting and to hold these polluters accountable," said Mary Lee Orr, director of the Louisiana Environmental Action Network.</p>
        <p>"I don't want to leave the impression that we didn't have these priorities in the past," said James F. Dutcher, a spokesman at the Louisiana American Cyanamid plant. "But there is much more public pressure for us to reduce discharges, and we are reducing them."</p>
        <p>But environmentalists say the law has weaknesses. Some dangerous chemicals, among them radioactive substances and the insecticide malathion, are missing from the list. In some cases, a loophole enables manufacturers to circumvent the need to report toxic emissions. Small businesses are exempt from filing a report altogether. Prompted by Bhopal</p>
        <p>The Community Right to Know Act, prompted by the deaths of thousands in a 1984 chemical disaster in Bhopal, India, was approved despite a desperate lobbying campaign by manufacturers, opposition by the White House and public denouncements by the most powerful lawmakers in Congress, who thought the bill would prove to be too much of an onus on industry.</p>
        <p>"It was a philosophical leap of faith," said Representative Gerry Sikorski, the Democrat from Minnesota who sponsored the proposal in Congress, "kind of a heartfelt belief that people in communities have an absolute, fundamental right to know what goes into the air their kids breathe, the water they drink and the ground they play on."</p>
        <p>Industrial executives and environmental groups agree that the law's most important contribution has been to cause companies to recognize the extent of their discharges and the effect they may have on public health.</p>
        <p>The first inventory, published by the E.P.A. in 1989, showed that releases of toxic chemicals totaled billions of pounds in 1987. Some of the nation's largest companies later responded with voluntary programs to reduce such pollution. A.T.&amp;T., for example, said it would stop all emissions of the listed chemicals into the air by the turn of the century.</p>
        <p>After the second inventory was made public in 1990, the E.P.A. asked more than 600 companies to cut in half voluntarily emissions of the 17 most dangerous toxic chemicals, including benzene, cyanide, mercury and chromium, by 1995. "If we succeed," said William K. Reilly, the Administrator of the E.P.A., "this program could set the pace for a new cooperative way of addressing the nation's environmental goals."</p>
        <p>The law has galvanized small citizens groups. According to a report in Working Notes, a newsletter in Washington that tracks the use of the law, an environmental group in northern California raised concerns last year about the storage and use of chlorine in treating cooling water at a Chevron refinery in Richmond. Chevron stopped using the chemical at that plant last December.</p>
        <p>The Raytheon Company pledged in December that it would use safer water-based solutions to clean computer circuit boards after a group in Massachusetts criticized the company's use of chemicals that deplete the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Despite its growing ability to influence environmental struggles throughout the country, the right-to-know law has flaws, said Paul Orum, editor of Working Notes. Any business with nine or fewer employees is exempted from reporting discharges. And an estimate by a congressional research group, the Office of Technology Assessment, said emissions from these sources could total billions of pounds.</p>
        <p>In a report released earlier this month, Mr. Orum and three co-authors said that companies have disposed of at least 200 million pounds of toxic chemicals under the recycling exemption while sidestepping reporting requirements. "This loophole is undermining the law because it allows companies to claim waste reductions when, in fact, they aren't reducing pollution at all," Mr. Orum said.</p>
        <p>Few states have reacted to the right-to-know law as aggressively as Louisiana, which has some of the worst environmental problems in the country. Four plants by themselves, including American Cyanamid, Shell, and two owned by Freeport McMoRan, discharged 460 million pounds of toxic chemicals in 1988, more than all the plants in Ohio and nearly three times as much as those in New Jersey. The state Department of Environmental Quality called in the three companies and other top toxic-waste dischargers in the state and demanded that they establish plans to reduce emissions.</p>
        <p>Since its plant opened 20 miles from New Orleans in the early 1950's, American Cyanamid has disposed of most of its toxic wastes by pumping them into a well 3,000 feet underground. Some 75 billion pounds of chemicals have been injected underground. The disposal method was certified as safe in November by the E.P.A., but Louisiana has sought for several years to close the well because of concern that chemicals will contaminate ground water.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dutcher, the plant spokesman, said last week that 750 jobs and a nearly $25 million annual payroll could be at stake if the plant was forced to change its disposal practices.</p>
        <p>Louisiana, which has a $900 million deficit and an array of economic ills, took note. When American Cyanamid submitted its plan last year to reduce the discharging of toxic waste into the well by 17 percent, state officials deemed the proposal "satisfactory."</p>
