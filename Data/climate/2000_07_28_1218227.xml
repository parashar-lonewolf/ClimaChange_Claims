        <p>The various industries responsible for much of the country's air pollution -- the oil companies, the automakers, the big utilities -- have usually resisted federal clean air regulations, routinely overestimating the costs of the regulations while underestimating the ability of their engineers to satisfy them. In the 30 years since the passage of the Clean Air Act, industry has rarely been out in front of government.

        <p>The company's move deserves applause from anyone who worries about carbon dioxide, a so-called greenhouse gas that is thought to be a major contributor to global warming. Cars and trucks are responsible for about one-third of the carbon dioxide produced in the United States, and S.U.V.'s are responsible for a big chunk of that. S.U.V.'s, pickup trucks and vans now account for half the vehicles sold in America. This has been a boon for Detroit but not for cleaner air, mainly because S.U.V.'s, which are officially classed as light trucks, have been allowed to emit up to three times as much pollution per mile as standard cars.

        <p>The various industries responsible for much of the country's air pollution -- the oil companies, the automakers, the big utilities -- have usually resisted federal clean air regulations, routinely overestimating the costs of the regulations while underestimating the ability of their engineers to satisfy them. In the 30 years since the passage of the Clean Air Act, industry has rarely been out in front of government. Yesterday, however, the Ford Motor Company reversed this paradigm with the announcement that it would increase the average fuel economy of its sport utility vehicles by 25 percent over the next five years. It did so even though Congress recently rejected yet another effort by environmentalists to tighten up fuel economy standards.</p>
        <p>The company's move deserves applause from anyone who worries about carbon dioxide, a so-called greenhouse gas that is thought to be a major contributor to global warming. Cars and trucks are responsible for about one-third of the carbon dioxide produced in the United States, and S.U.V.'s are responsible for a big chunk of that. S.U.V.'s, pickup trucks and vans now account for half the vehicles sold in America. This has been a boon for Detroit but not for cleaner air, mainly because S.U.V.'s, which are officially classed as light trucks, have been allowed to emit up to three times as much pollution per mile as standard cars. They also consume about one-third to one-half more fuel than ordinary cars.</p>
        <p>Last year the Environmental Protection Agency began a crackdown on S.U.V.'s, using the so-called tailpipe standards authorized by the Clean Air Act. It issued new rules that will require S.U.V.'s to meet the same emission standards that apply to ordinary cars and govern pollutants like nitrogen oxide, a precursor to urban smog. At the same time, the E.P.A. required the oil companies to produce a cleaner-burning gasoline to increase the efficiency of a car's catalytic converter, the device that strips most pollutants from auto exhaust.</p>
        <p>But the catalytic converter does nothing to decrease emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas. The only way to reduce carbon dioxide, short of installing an engine that does not use fossil fuels, is to increase fuel efficiency. That is what Ford's new strategy for its S.U.V.'s would do.</p>
        <p>While committing itself to more fuel-efficient S.U.V.'s, the company remains opposed, along with other automakers, to legislative efforts to increase fuel economy standards generally. These standards have not significantly changed in nearly 20 years. Ford's answer to what some see as an inconsistency is that it opposes top-down regulation but will respond to consumer-driven market forces. Ford says it is convinced that consumers are ready to sacrifice a modest amount of engine power and size in exchange for a cleaner S.U.V. It also argues that it has the technology to increase the fuel economy of S.U.V.'s without increasing prices -- the implication being that it will be able to do the same for other cars if allowed to proceed at its own pace.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists on the whole were delighted. They noted that if Ford can build S.U.V.'s that yield much better mileage per gallon, other companies are sure to follow. If they do, William C. Ford Jr., Ford's chairman and the great-grandson of Henry Ford, will further solidify his reputation as the most adventurous executive in an industry not previously known for environmental stewardship.</p>
