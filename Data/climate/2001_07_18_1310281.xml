        <p>ALBANY, July 17 Â— A federal proposal to drill for oil and gas under the Finger Lakes, part of the state's only national forest preserve, has met with unusual silence from Gov. George E. Pataki</p>

        <p>A federal proposal to drill for oil and gas under the Finger Lakes, part of the state's only national forest preserve, has met with unusual silence from Gov. George E. Pataki.</p>
        <p>''We have not been asked by either side to weigh in on that issue,'' the governor said today, responding to a reporter's question as he opened a nature center at Thompson's Lake State Park, just west of here. ''We will continue to look at it and see what may or may not be appropriate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki's response to this proposal is in contrast to his position on other federal proposals affecting the environment. The governor, who has cast himself as a Republican friendly to environmental causes, has criticized President Bush for opposing an international treaty to reduce global warming and for loosening standards on arsenic levels in drinking water. He has expressed ''grave reservations'' about a White House proposal to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists who oppose the Finger Lakes proposal said today that they hoped that the governor would join the opposition.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't make sense for a limited supply of fuel to jeopardize a freshwater body like one of the Finger Lakes,'' said Margaret Wooster, executive director of Great Lakes United, an environmental group in Buffalo. ''He's taken a wishy-washy stand on this, not a strong stand. I think he probably hasn't had enough pressure.''</p>
        <p>Since April, the United States Forest Service has sought public comment on a draft environmental impact statement on the proposal to lease 13,000 acres under the Finger Lakes National Forest.</p>
        <p>The statement says construction of roads and drilling pads could cause soil erosion; forest dwellers like the Indiana bat could suffer; and ''conflicts with recreation uses could be substantive.''</p>
