        <p>LEAD:  'A CONNECTICUT YANKEE'  The Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam is observing the 100th anniversary of Mark Twain's ''Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court'' by reviving a 1927 musical comedy based on the book. It will open the new season on Tuesday and run until June 23.</p>
        <p>'A CONNECTICUT YANKEE'  The Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam is observing the 100th anniversary of Mark Twain's ''Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court'' by reviving a 1927 musical comedy based on the book. It will open the new season on Tuesday and run until June 23.</p>
        <p>The familiar Rodgers and Hart score includes songs that have remained fresh through three generations, among them ''Thou Swell,'' ''My Heart Stood Still'' and ''To Keep My Love Alive.'' The book by Herbert Fields follows the adventures of a Nutmegger who, after a knock on the head, finds himself in medieval England, where he confounds Camelot with his Yankee ingenuity and the latest 19th-century mechanical inventions, and finds the love of his life.</p>
        <p>Performances of ''A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court'' are at 8 P.M. Wednesday to Friday, 5 and 9 P.M. Saturday, 2 and 6 P.M. Sunday and 2:30 P.M. for Wednesday matinees. Tickets are $16 to $25.50. The box office number is 873-8668.  RENAISSANCE MILAN</p>
        <p>The artistic achievements of the Court of Milan will be represented in 125 paintings, drawing, prints, illustrated books, medals, sculpture and armor on view at the Yale Art Gallery, Chapel Street in New Haven, Saturday to June 4.</p>
        <p>Among the artists who flourished from time to time under the patronage of the Sforza family, which ruled Milan for almost a century beginning in 1450, were Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance architect Donato Bramante. Others in the exhibition may not be as well known, but they are nonetheless noteworthy for the beauty of their work and the innovative sculptural and painterly techniques they employed. They include Vincenzo Poppa, Ambrogio Bergognone, Giovanni Pietro Birago, Andrea Solario and Bernardino Luini.</p>
        <p>The exhibition has been assembled from collections in London, Paris, Milan and the United States. The curator, Andrea Norris, director of the Spencer Art Museum at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, organized the show for the Archer M. Huntington Art Gallery at the University of Texas. She will deliver a free talk titled ''The Art of the Sforza Court in Milan'' at 5:30 P.M. Saturday in the gallery lecture hall.</p>
        <p>Exhibition hours are from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesday to Saturday and 2 to 5 P.M. Sunday. Admission is free.  HOME-GROWN ART</p>
        <p>When Wilson Wilde, president of the Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company, was about to redesign his offices in 1978, he decided to do it with Connecticut art. The results of his subsequent 10-year quest all over the country for paintings, furniture and decorative arts by artists from Connecticut, may be seen in an exhibition at the Wadsworth Atheneum until May 21.</p>
        <p>Bearing the somewhat unwieldy title ''Connecticut Masters, Connecticut Treasures: the Collection of the Hartford Steam Boiler and Insurance Company,'' the show contains more than 100 items, or about 80 percent of the collection.</p>
        <p>''We have a committee which meets periodically to select pieces and to decide what we are still looking for,'' said Judith Lefebvre, collection curator and member of the committee with Mr. Wilde; Charles Ferguson, former director of the New Britain Museum of American Art, and Jeff Anderson, curator of the Florence Griswold Museum in Old Lyme.</p>
        <p>''This is the first time the collection has been exhibited publicly,'' Ms. Lefebvre said. Its normal habitat is the 12th-floor offices of the insurance company building, where the paintings and furniture are incorporated into the decor. ''The earliest piece is a sunflower chest, or dowry chest, made in Wethersfield in the late 1700's,'' the curator said.</p>
        <p>The paintings cover most of the major American schools and trends, and include works by Frederick Church, Thomas Cole, Ralph Earl, John Kensett, Childe Hassam and John Twachtman.</p>
        <p>Visiting hours are from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesday to Sunday. Admission is $3, students and the elderly $1.50, free on Thursdays and from 11 A.M. to 1 P.M. Saturdays.  'EVENING WITH ELLA'</p>
        <p>Ella Fitzgerald will reprise some of the musical magic on her more than 200 record albums in a benefit concert for the Friends of Stamford Center for the Arts at 8 P.M. Saturday at the Palace Theater, 61 Atlantic Street.</p>
        <p>Tickets for ''An Evening with Ella,'' including champagne at intermission, are $29, $34 and $39. Call 323-2131 for reservations. Tickets that include a New Orleans-style dinner and dancing at Metro Center after the performance cost $150. Call 348-6598.  ENVIRONMENTAL LAW</p>
        <p>A number of Yale Law School graduates who were involved in the environmental movement 20 ago will return to their alma mater this weekend for a symposium titled ''Environmental Law Turns 20.''</p>
        <p>The 16 panels and workshops include discussions on the greenhouse effect; ''Ethics, Science and Politics of Environmental Protection''; ''Managing Growth: Regional Energy and Land Use''; ''Women in Environmental Law''; ''Tactics: Choosing Among Litigation, Regulation, Legislation and Negotiation,'' and ''Endangered Species, Wilderness Preservation and the American Way.''</p>
        <p>Among the panelists are Dick Ayres and Johanna Wald of the Natural Resources Defense Council; Bill Butler, an early member of the Environmental Defense Fund, and Bill Drayton, founder of the Ashoka Foundation. Hours from the free program are from 2 to 6 P.M. Friday and 9:30 A.M. to 6 P.M. Saturday in the auditorium of the law school, 127 Wall Street in New Haven. For more information call 432-4881.  LONG LIVES</p>
        <p>Jens Bjerre, a Danish anthropologist, will stop in Old Saybrook as part of his American lecture tour to give a talk on ''Hunza: Kingdom of Longevity'' and narrate his films.</p>
        <p>Hunzas live in the Himalayan Mountains of northern Pakistan and appear to be 20 years younger than they actually are. Men continue to father children at the age of 90, and cancer and heart attacks are unknown. The film includes footage of the Khyber Pass, 5,000-year-old rock carvings, arcane bazaars, Afghan refugee camps and other scenes that most travelers are unlikely to encounter.</p>
        <p>Admission to the program, which was arranged by the Old Saybrook Historical Society, is $5. The program will begin at 8 P.M. Friday in high school auditorium on Boston Post Road. $90ELEANOR CHARLES</p>
