        <p>LEAD: The American Telephone and Telegraph Company announced today that by 1994 it would end all use of chemicals that deplete the earth's ozone layer.</p>
        <p>The American Telephone and Telegraph Company announced today that by 1994 it would end all use of chemicals that deplete the earth's ozone layer.</p>
        <p>The action by A.T.&amp;T., one of the world's biggest consumers of such chlorofluorocarbons, is likely to hasten the development of substitutes and to make those substitutes available at marketable costs.</p>
        <p>The company has notified all its suppliers that they will be expected to comply with an international treaty on chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's. The treaty now calls for a 50 percent reduction in the production and use of the chemicals by the year 2000. But a consensus appears to be building internationally that the treaty should be revised to eliminate the chemicals by the end of the century.</p>
        <p>Chlorofluorocarbons, which are used in hundreds of ways in making electronic products, have been found to destroy the ozone in the upper atmosphere that shields the Earth from ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. Elevated levels of such radiation can cause skin cancer and eye cataracts in humans, as well as damage to wildlife and crops.</p>
        <p>A.T.&amp;T., which uses three million pounds of chlorofluorocarbons a year in the manufacture of computer chips and circuit boards, said it intended to reduce consumption of the chemical by 50 percent by 1991 and eliminate all consumption by 1994.</p>
        <p>The telephone company said alternatives were difficult to develop and take long to test. But it said it knew of no uses for which there were not potential alternatives.</p>
        <p>Dr. Stephen O. Andersen, chief of the technology and economics branch of the Environmental Protection Agency's division of global change, called the A.T.&amp;T. announcement ''good news.''</p>
        <p>Two other companies have previously announced plans to end the use of CFC's in the near future. Northern Telecom of Canada said it would gradually eliminate such use by 1991 and Seiko Epson of Japan has pledged to end the use of the chemicals by 1991.</p>
        <p>The Du Pont Company, which began use of CFC's in the 1930's and remains the biggest producer of the chemicals, has said it intends to end all production of them shortly after the turn of the century. Most food packaging companies have ended the use of plastic foam made with the chemicals.</p>
        <p>David Chittick, AT&amp;T's vice president for environment and safety engineering, said that with today's announcement, the company ''formalizes an already established commitment to rid itself of CFC's at the earliest possible date.''</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview, however, Mr. Chittick said the company might have to use hydrogen chlorofluorocarbons as a substitute for some uses, at least for a while. Those chemicals emit some, although much less, ozone-depleting chemicals into the atmosphere than CFC's.</p>
