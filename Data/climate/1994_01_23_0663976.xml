        <p>It's not nearly as cold as you think.</p>
        <p>That's the view of weather experts who see this month's Arctic freeze in the eastern United States as just a downward, localized blip in a generally warmer trend in the world's climate.</p>
        <p>January 1994, the climate analysts say, is not likely to herald a return of the cold winters of yesteryear. A classic January thaw over the next few days is expected to consign the recent gelid snap to history, and forecasters do not expect the extreme cold of the last few weeks to return this year.</p>
        <p>"In fact, it might not get this cold again for the next 20 years," Paul G. Knight, a meteorologist with the Weather Communications Group of Pennsylvania State University, said the other day as temperatures were plunging to all-time lows across much of the nation's eastern half. North Meets South</p>
        <p>The free-fall this month into the deep freeze seemed all the more shocking because of the many mild winters in recent years. Its cause was a deep dip to the south last week in the main west-to-east jet stream marking the boundary between Arctic air and the warmer air to the south. The shift allowed an entire pool of air from northern Canada to move southward across the eastern half of the country.</p>
        <p>Now the jet stream is shifting again, forecasters say, and should move back into Canada this week, taking the super-cold air with it.</p>
        <p>The forecasters say the wild behavior resulted from the interplay of myriad forces, whose chaotic outcomes are inherently unpredictable.  It is "difficult to ascribe it to any one factor or force within the climate system," said Dr. David Robinson, a climate expert at Rutgers University.  "Simple chance could be one reason."  Winter's 2 Patterns</p>
        <p>Generally, meteorologists say, an American winter is divided into two sharply different weather patterns, each lasting four to six weeks. The pattern that produced this month's cold wave began around the winter solstice, five weeks ago.</p>
        <p>Forecasters expect it to "flip" this week, bringing more moderate temperatures to the East and Midwest and cooler, wetter conditions to Western states, where winter weather until now has been warm and dry.</p>
        <p>The switch is occurring almost in conjunction with the traditional January thaw, said Jim Wagner, a meteorologist at the Climate Analysis Center of the National Weather Service in Camp Springs, Md. Statistical studies have established that the thaw usually occurs around Jan. 20-23 but that it does not always materialize.</p>
        <p>The expected thaw does not necessarily mean the Northeast will immediately have balmy weather. Cold air will remain in central and northeastern Canada, said Mr. Knight, and its influence, coupled with snow cover, could keep temperatures a little depressed. A Look at the Future</p>
        <p>On the wider scale of events, this month's weather in America is no guide to what may happen in the future around the globe, weather experts say. Scientists who keep track of the average global temperature say the general warming trend of the 1980's and early 90's has resumed after two cooler years, 1991 and 1992, caused by the eruption of the Mount Pinatubo volcano in the Philippines.  The temperature rise was just a fraction of a degree, said Tom Karl, a climatologist at the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, N.C.</p>
        <p>Barring another major volcanic eruption, according to computer model forecasts, the global temperature will exceed the 1990 record some time in the latter half of this decade. So far, the post-Pinatubo recovery has borne out the model's prediction. Natural or Human Forces?</p>
        <p>The cause of this warming trend is a matter of long and unresolved debate. Some scientists blame heat-trapping gases, like carbon dioxide, produced from burning coal and oil.  Skeptics say the warming is just a natural variation in climate.</p>
        <p>The contradiction between a super-cold winter and a global warming trend is only apparent. A warmer world would not be without cold winters, climatologists say; it would merely make them less frequent. For that matter, not all of the United States has bucked the long-term warming trend this winter: while the East has been freezing, parts of the West have had record warmth.</p>
        <p>Forecasters with a long memory do not like to trust in any trend, including the present warming pattern. Seventeen years ago, the talk was of global cooling, as the eastern United States suffered through the first of three straight severe winters, an occurrence not to be found in meteorological records before or since.  Some scientists postulated a new ice age, in part because the 1960's and 1970's had both been unusually cold decades in the United States.</p>
        <p>The National Weather Service predicts that temperatures will be normal or slightly cooler than normal and precipitation normal or slightly heavier than normal in the East through mid-February.</p>
