        <p>LEAD: ON A DINGY BASEMENT office of the California Institute of Technology's astronomy department in Pasadena, Christine Wilson has surrounded herself with symbols of her earthly passions: a volleyball schedule is taped on a wall near her desk; next to it, a cartoon about how falling in love is like having cooties.</p>
        <p>ON A DINGY BASEMENT office of the California Institute of Technology's astronomy department in Pasadena, Christine Wilson has surrounded herself with symbols of her earthly passions: a volleyball schedule is taped on a wall near her desk; next to it, a cartoon about how falling in love is like having cooties. Tacked onto a bulletin board is a reminder that ''Life Is Too Short to Drink Cheap Beer,'' and hanging from a bookshelf is the red-and-white uniform of her Sweet Adeline quartet.</p>
        <p>Almost buried among these whimsical personal mementos, there is a single hint of the 24-year-old graduate student's connection to the cosmos. It is a French newspaper clipping, headlined ''La Comete de Christine.'' A laid-back Canadian with dual American citizenship, Christine Wilson has a keen sense of propriety when it comes to her celestial namesake - a lump of rock and ice floating through space that is formally registered as Comet Wilson by the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, in Cambridge, Mass., an agency of the International Astronomical Union. ''I'll get excited about it again,'' she shrugs, ''if it gets really bright'' as it comes closer to Earth.</p>
        <p>Ms. Wilson's discovery of her comet nine months before perihelion - its closest approach to the sun -has provided astronomers with an unusual opportunity to track its orbit (map, page 55) and has given them substantial lead time to make plans for studying it by requesting time on major telescopes around the world.</p>
        <p>Comet Wilson is expected to wander within 110 million miles of the Sun and 60 million miles of Earth in late April. Unlike Halley's comet, which orbits the Sun every 76 years and on its last appearance came within 39 million miles of Earth, Comet Wilson could take anywhere from several hundred to a million years to complete an orbit.</p>
        <p>Amateur astronomers in the United States who know precisely where on the horizon to point their telescopes - as with Halley's, Wilson's will not easily be visible to the naked eye in the Northern Hemisphere - might be able to see the new comet in late May or in June, when it is once again in the northern skies, where Ms. Wilson first spotted it. The best visibility, as with Halley's, is expected to be in the Southern Hemisphere - New Zealand, Australia or Chile. Still, as Brian G. Marsden, director of the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, puts it, comets ''are awfully unpredictable.''</p>
        <p>Christine Wilson accidentally stumbled on the comet that now bears her name during the dark of the moon last Aug. 5, when she photographed a portion of the sky with the 48-inch Schmidt telescope at the Palomar Observatory, 65 miles northeast of San Diego. The next day, while checking the photographic plate for streaks from satellites and smudges from emulsion, she spotted a fuzzy patch about the size of a pinhead. ''It was kind of a fluke,'' she says.</p>
        <p>Now, some astronomers believe her comet might rival the size and brightness of Halley's. Moreover, Comet Wilson, with its parabolic orbit, may be a ''new'' comet, making its first entry into the inner solar system, as opposed to a ''rediscovered'' one like Halley's. Comet Wilson is thought to have originated in the Oort cloud, a vast swarm of billions of scattered comets that have remained in a cosmic deep freeze for billions of years, preserved against the destructive effects of solar heat and light by their more than four trillion miles' distance from the Sun.</p>
        <p>COMETS ARE, IN EFFECT, astronomy's Rosetta stones, the most pristine samples of our solar system's birth 4.6 billion years ago. ''We now believe, even more firmly than we did before the Halley experience, that comets hold a key to understanding the origin of the solar system, because they are the most primitive, or least processed, material remaining from the interstellar cloud from which the solar system formed,'' says Marcia Neugebauer, a comet scientist of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. In other words, the study of comets is really the study of origins, of beginnings and extinctions.</p>
        <p>In all, there are now 750 comets for which orbits have been calculated; about 100 of these make short-period orbits of less than 100 years around the sun. Every year, about 12 comets are discovered, half of which turn out to be rediscovered.</p>
        <p>Christine Wilson lucked out in finding her comet on a photographic plate because of its fuzzy, almost hairlike, trail -the word ''comet'' comes from the Greek word kometes, meaning ''hairy one.''</p>
        <p>As part of her summer research assistant job, she had been photographing a field of faint galaxies for Caltech's Palomar Sky Survey, a giant astronomical map of the northern sky to be contained on 2,682 glass plates. The five-year survey, an update of one conducted 30 years ago, is being described by some as a celestial Funk &amp; Wagnalls. Wallace L. W. Sargent, a professor of astronomy at Caltech, says he is hopeful that in addition to more comet discoveries, the survey might also turn up another planet and possibly the so-called Nemesis star, a hypothetical companion to the Sun that over the centuries has sent comet showers to Earth, causing widespread extinctions.</p>
        <p>NOT ALL COMET DISCOVERIES are as serendipitous as was Christine Wilson's. Eugene M. Shoemaker of the United States Geological Survey in Flagstaff, Ariz.; his wife, Carolyn, an asteroid astronomer, and Eleanor F. Helin, a planetary scientist of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, spend several nights a month atop Mount Palomar patrolling the skies for comets and Earth-crossing asteroids. ''We're looking for the Wrong-Way Corrigans, and the things near Earth,'' says Eugene Shoemaker, ''because those are the guys that are potential colliders.''</p>
        <p>In the process, the Shoemakers have found eight new comets in the last four years, plus eight Earth-approaching asteroids - two of which they think are extinct comets.</p>
        <p>Self-described ''catastrophists,'' the three are among scientists who believe the evidence is good that the extinctions of dinosaurs and other life forms were caused by a periodic shower of comets or asteroids, and they are trying to determine ''pulses'' in the bombardment rate.</p>
        <p>''We could predict with precision if a collision were imminent, say in 10 years, but the chance of our seeing an object that would hit the earth in the next hundred years is only one in a thousand,'' says Mr. Shoemaker, who has spent the last 30 years studying crater impacts on the Earth, Moon and the moons of other planets.</p>
        <p>One of Eleanor Helin's goals is a manned space flight to deflect an asteroid on a collision course with the Earth. ''We're going to have a big earthquake in California,'' she says. ''It's just when it'll happen. So, it's kind of the same game with asteroids, except we don't have the seismographs.''</p>
        <p>FOR MANY ASTRONOMERS, Comet Wilson will provide a chance to pick up where they left off with Comet Halley. Michael A'Hearn, a professor of astronomy at the University of Maryland, says that Comet Wilson's water-vaporization rate and gas production are higher than Halley's at the same distance in space, so he expects it to be brighter. ''That means,'' A'Hearn says, ''we can do more experiments on this comet than we could do on Halley.''</p>
        <p>Scientists are especially eager to figure out what Comet Wilson is made of, how it differs from other comets and how it is the same, with the ultimate goal of addressing the question: How did the solar system form? Not only is it possible that comets caused the extinction of some forms of life, but some scientists suggest comets may actually be responsible for life on Earth - either indirectly by supplying a large fraction of Earth's atmosphere, or more directly by supplying the organic molecules fundamental to life.</p>
        <p>Peter A. Wehinger and Susan Wyckoff, astronomers at Arizona State University, plan to observe Comet Wilson in Australia. There they will conduct spectroscopic studies - dissecting light through diffraction gratings to determine the chemical composition of the comet's tail, searching for isotopes of carbon to offer clues about the comet's origins.</p>
        <p>At the Goddard Space Flight Center, in Greenbelt, Md., Paul D. Feldman, a professor of physics and astronomy at Johns Hopkins University who has been following the comet since it traveled through the asteroid belt in September, will continue to study its behavior to see how it evolves as a result of radiation heating from the sun. Along with a number of West European colleagues, he will monitor information as it is being tracked by the International Ultraviolet Explorer, a satellite observatory launched in 1978 by NASA, the European Space agency and the Science Research Council of Britain.</p>
        <p>Roger Knacke, a professor of astronomy at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, and a team of colleagues from SUNY and the University of Hawaii plan to work from Mauna Kea's infrared telescope in Hawaii toward identifying in Comet Wilson a tarlike chemical, mainly molecules of carbon and hydrogen, that was discovered in Comet Halley last year. There are strong suspicions that the dark substance contributes to the black crust that was found to cover Halley's. Such dark surfaces are also seen on some of the satellites of Jupiter and Saturn, leading scientists to wonder if there are connections between the planetary satellites and comets.</p>
        <p>What is particularly compelling about Comet Wilson, says comet scientist Donald K. Yeomans of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, is that because it is traveling directly from the Oort cloud, it ''should be relatively fresh'' with volatile ices, like carbon dioxide or methane, that have never interacted with the Sun. So, it may not have a dark crust on its surface. ''But we were dead wrong about Halley,'' he added, referring to predictions that the surface of its nucleus would be bright. ''There's no reason we shouldn't be dead wrong about this one.''</p>
        <p>MANY COMET scientists are already working on a space mission to a short-period comet called Tempel 2. If funds are forthcoming from Congress next year, the mission, known as the Comet Rendezvous Asteroid Flyby, will launch a spacecraft built by NASA and West Germany in 1993 to rendezvous with Tempel 2 in late 1996.</p>
        <p>At that time, a penetrator will spear the comet's nucleus to determine its chemical elements. A subsequent rendezvous will bring back to Earth a frozen, deep-core comet sample for analysis. ''We have to go right up and touch the tiny little grains to really know what we're talking about,'' says Marcia Neugebauer, project scientist for the flyby mission.</p>
        <p>For the time being, however, it is Comet Wilson's appearance that will be receiving most scientific attention. As for the young discoverer, she says she is more concerned just now about her dissertation topic than about trying to catch a glimpse of her comet. If she does try, it will probably be on a telescope at Palomar. The sightings would be better in the Southern Hemisphere, but, sounding very much like the student she still is, Christine Wilson says: ''I don't think I have the money or time to go see it. If I do go, it will be in May, when it will be an evening object, because I don't like to get up early if I don't have to.''</p>
