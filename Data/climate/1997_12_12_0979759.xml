        <p>Korea Delays Bond Sale, Rattling World Markets  The crisis in South Korea worsened as the country's largest state-owned bank abruptly postponed an important bond sale, meaning that South Korea must come up with other ways to pay or renegotiate billions of dollars in debts coming due in the next few weeks.</p>
