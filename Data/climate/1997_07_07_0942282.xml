        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You observe that President Clinton needs a ''credible plan'' to sell  a global warming treaty (editorial, June 29). He's off to a bad start, calling, as he did in his speech to  the United Nations environmental conference, for solar panels to  be installed on a million more  roofs.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You observe that President Clinton needs a ''credible plan'' to sell  a global warming treaty (editorial, June 29). He's off to a bad start, calling, as he did in his speech to  the United Nations environmental conference, for solar panels to  be installed on a million more  roofs.</p>
        <p>In our community and neighboring areas, most homes are shaded  by trees and could not use the units. If a tax incentive were offered  for the installation, would trees be cut down? If not, would we have to pay for the panels installed elsewhere?</p>
        <p>Solar power is the development that never developed. Billions of dollars have been spent on ''renewable'' energy ideas that have no place in our electric generation profile today. If they could work, we would have the reduction of emissions the Europeans call for. The reason for the failure: They have a political rather than a scientific base.</p>
        <p>Ratification of a global warming treaty will require abandonment of the dedication to ''green'' infallibility. Let's have an open dialogue on all of these ideas. Solar power is a good place to start.</p>
