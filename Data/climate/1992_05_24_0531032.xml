        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Last week delegates from 143 countries reached tentative accord on a Framework Convention on Climate Change after marathon debates during their final negotiating session at the United Nations in New York.</p>
        <p>As it stands, the convention requires that industrialized countries look to "return by the end of the present decade to earlier levels of anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases" but includes no specific reductions or timetable. While the convention has been criticized as being too weak, a second criticism must be directed not to the result but to the process.</p>
        <p>The group began the negotiating process more than 15 months ago, pursuant to a United Nations resolution. During the third session, held in September 1991, the European Community surprised many delegates by endorsing the specific commitment of stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000. Japan, Australia, Canada and the Scandinavian countries soon followed suit. Virtually all developed countries also supported the proposal. Only the United States stood its ground, and the stalemate lasted through the next two sessions.</p>
        <p>Shortly before the start of the final session, the chairman of the group, Jean Ripert of France, consulted with a handful of member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, including the United States and Britain, to develop language substantially the same as that adopted last week. During the session Mr. Ripert in essence admitted he had bowed to the U.S. position so that the U.S. would be a party to the proposed convention.</p>
        <p>While practical, Mr. Ripert's action lacked courage. Many arguments exist for structuring a treaty palatable to the United States. As both the world's largest greenhouse-gas emitter and the world's deepest pocket, the U.S. must be a party to make the treaty meaningful, so the argument goes. Even without the United States, however, the treaty's effectiveness might not have suffered greatly. Furthermore, as industrialized countries party to the convention develop new energy-saving technology, U.S. companies would be obliged to keep pace with their foreign competitors. In bowing to the U.S., Mr. Ripert sacrificed the willingness of many for the obstinacy of one.</p>
        <p>It is unfortunate for the other delegates, the negotiating process and the global environment that the treaty to be signed at the Earth Summit next month in Rio de Janeiro is the anti climactic (and anti-climatic) result of the long, arduous negotiations that preceded it.
