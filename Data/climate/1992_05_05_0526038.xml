        <p>In a parking lot on West 46th Street, the measure of Broadway's success often comes down to this: At what time can Frank Gonzalez play chess?</p>
        <p>With remarkable speed and even more remarkable dexterity, five guys -- none named Moe -- wheel the BMW's, Mercedes-Benzes and Lincoln Continentals of harried theatergoers into spaces prudent drivers might consider best suited for Volkswagens.</p>
        <p>When the lot is filled, Mr. Gonzalez, the lot manager, settles into his white clapboard booth for his nightly chess game with his employees. If he starts by 7:30,he knows the theaters are doing well.</p>
        <p>These days, he's playing at 7 o'clock. And all Broadway is smiling.</p>
        <p>"Good? Things are</p>
        <p>very good</p>
        <p>," said Mr. Gonzalez. "In the 12 years I've been here, I've never seen so many shows open all at the same time."</p>
        <p>As surely as producers live or die on reviews, Mr. Gonzalez's Restaurant Row parking lot -- like scores of midtown restaurants, hotels and gift shops -- thrives or busts on Broadway's ticket sales.  Stories from the businesses say a lot about the health of one of New York's most vital areas. This spring, after a grim year of darkened marquees and empty seats, the sales are booming. In April, Broadway attracted more than 830,000 theatergoers and the box-office receipts, $30.1 million, were the highest of any four-week total in New York theater history, according to the League of American Theaters and Producers.</p>
        <p>George Wachtel, director of research for the league, projects that by the end of the season on May 31, Broadway will have generated $562 million in economic activity for midtown, $45 million above last season.</p>
        <p>With 28 productions at the end of April, seven more than in the same period last year, the Great White Way has the hurly-burly feel of a gold-rush boomtown once more. Cafes are bustling, restaurant reservations are up and armadas of limousines are again commandeering entire blocks outside theaters.</p>
        <p>"There seems to be so much more going on," said Jon Dietrich, a salesman at One Shubert Alley, the theatrical gift shop off West 45th Street. "Everyone who comes in these days is filled with excitement. It's in the air. And it keeps us all up." The Electricity Factor</p>
        <p>The message on the chalkboard inside Sam's restaurant on West 45th Street told the whole story: "Falsettos -- break a leg. Love, Sam."</p>
        <p>It was opening night for the musical at the John Golden Theater across the street, and the restaurant workers, most of them actors themselves, were waiting in tense anticipation for the newspaper reviews.</p>
        <p>When the first editions arrived at 10 P.M., Craig Dawson, a waiter, ripped to the review, read for a moment, and then sighed. In relief. A rave.</p>
        <p>"With ticket prices the way they are, people won't buy until a play is considered a sure-fire success," said Mr. Dawson, 41 years old. "We're so dependent on the street, we have to keep our finger to the pulse of the business."</p>
        <p>The owner, Sam Sapienza, said the pulse was throbbing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sapienza, whose father opened the restaurant as a speakeasy in 1929, likes to measure the block's vigor by its electrical use. Last year, with three theaters closed, was a low-watt year. Not as dark as the dire year of 1975, when a musicians' strike closed nine theaters and wiped out some of his restaurateur friends. But dim.</p>
        <p>This year, West 45th Street's seven theaters are all open, including the Imperial, where "Les Miserables" has been a money-making fixture.</p>
        <p>"The lights are up," the 62-year-old owner said. "And when the lights are up, everybody's alive." In Front of 'Streetcar'</p>
        <p>As the sun set below a pale blue sky, Frank Gonzalez had his workers in high gear, gunning cars in reverse, swerving down narrow parking lanes, briskly attending to the growing line of customers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gonzalez, a 40-year-old resident of Jackson Heights, Queens, orchestrated this operation like an an air-traffic controller, packing his 50-foot by 25-foot lot as tightly as a sardine can.</p>
        <p>"What play?" he asked a woman as she pulled her white Toyota into the lot entrance.</p>
        <p>"Two Trains something," she replied.</p>
        <p>" 'Two Trains Running,' " Mr. Gonzalez says. "About 10:30."</p>
        <p>Then, turning to a worker, he shouted, "Two Trains, el blanco," and the car was backed into the middle of the pack, somewhere behind "Falsettos" but well in front of "A Streetcar Named Desire."</p>
        <p>By 7:10 about eight spaces remained vacant and Mr. Gonzalez conceded that this was a slow night, by boomtown standards. But with a sudden spurt of activity, Mr. Gonzalez was positioning pawns by 7:30.</p>
        <p>He lost the chess game, but took it philosophically. "You can't win them all," he said. "At least business is good." 'No Mascara Left'</p>
        <p>It was 10:38 P.M., so the two women eyeing the mugs and t-shirts at One Shubert Alley must have just left "The Secret Garden."</p>
        <p>"How was it?" asked Mr. Dietrich, the salesmen.</p>
        <p>"I've got no mascara left," said a still teary-eyed Linda Golderg as she dug deep into her purse to pay for the musical's taped soundtrack. "I just love to cry."</p>
        <p>Nestled between the Booth and Shubert theaters, the tiny gift store, with its knickknacks and music boxes and soundtracks, is a good barometer of tourism's economic, and emotional, health.</p>
        <p>For Ms. Goldberg, 38, a self-proclaimed "I hate New York person" from Baltimore, Broadway offered an escape from a city she expected to be unwelcoming.</p>
        <p>A manager with Baltimore Gas and Electric, she was attending a conference on labor relations. Asked to introduce herself, she leapt to her feet and announced: "One of my skills is that I can remember the lyrics of every song I hear and I'm looking for someone to go to the theater with."</p>
        <p>At which point Janet Courtemanche, 43, from Boston, leapt to</p>
        <p>her</p>
        <p>feet and said: "That's me!"</p>
        <p>So there they were, two women crying their eyes out at "The Secret Garden," cementing a friendship. "New York, New York," said Ms. Goldberg. "It's an amazing town." No Answers, but Sales</p>
        <p>Among the theatergoers rushing from parking lots and restaurants to curtain time on a recent evening, questions seemed to outpace explanations for Broadway's revival. Had long-dormant theater lovers loosened their wallets because they believed the recession was over? Was the ticket-buying surge a result of better productions, more popular revivals, or just more tourists?</p>
        <p>Could it be, as David Letterman recently suggested, the naked ushers?</p>
        <p>It was Jessica Lange's star power that brought David Breault, a visitor from Tallahassee, Fla., to the Barrymore Theater and "A Streetcar Named Desire" on a recent night.</p>
        <p>"I thought it would be cool to see her," he said with a tug at his studded black-leather jacket. Unfortunately, his discount ticket placed him somewhat closer to the ozone layer than the orchestra pit. "It seemed like a good performance," he reflected. "It would have been nice if we could have seen her expressions."</p>
        <p>For Lurana Amis, like many New Yorkers, the question of whether to plunk down big money for seats hinged as much on economic as aesthetic issues.</p>
        <p>For five years, the Bronx resident has gone to plays with a group of friends at least twice a month, spending, she said, about $30 each night.  But over the past year, "nameless fears" about layoffs and recession have almost kept her away several times. Almost.</p>
        <p>"I didn't want to come tonight," Ms. Amis, 53, who teaches French at the Horace Mann School in the Bronx, said as she walked to "Two Trains Running." She had heard the play was depressing. A friend had canceled. But here she was. "I know that by 11 o'clock, I'll be happy," she said.</p>
