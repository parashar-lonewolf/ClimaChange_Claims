        <p>From television advertisements to vice-presidential oratory, the Republican attack against Senator John Kerry this week has been sharp, unsparing and unified: The Democratic candidate is ''wrong on defense.'' On Thursday, one Republican senator's response was just as sharp and unsparing, but much less unified: ''No, I do not believe that he is, quote, weak on defense.''</p>
        <p>What kind of Republican would say that? The John McCain kind, of course.</p>
        <p>Last week, the polite but impolitic admission by Mr. McCain that he would ''entertain'' an offer to be Mr. Kerry's running mate provided a good day's entertainment for the capital's chattering classes (until he ruled it out).</p>
        <p>Now, his defense of Mr. Kerry, a friend and fellow Vietnam veteran, shows once again how Mr. McCain's incorrigible independent streak and ill-disguised distance from President Bush make him one of Washington's most unpredictable -- and unavoidable -- men.</p>
        <p>''Apparently, you can't be friends anymore with somebody who is of a different party,'' Mr. McCain said in a telephone interview from Arizona this week, explaining how he managed to spark fleeting fantasies of a ticket that would amount to something between national unity and Oscar-and-Felix. ''I choose my friends on whether they're entertaining, they're interesting to be around, and whether they're good and decent people. Now, with this polarization that's going on, where both parties are running to their base, that kind of behavior is nearly unacceptable.''</p>
        <p>Except for Mr. McCain. Appearing Thursday on the ''Today'' program on NBC and the ''Early Show'' on CBS, Mr. McCain pointedly declined to second the charges of Vice President Dick Cheney and Mr. Bush's campaign advertisements that Mr. Kerry would be a threat to national security if elected.</p>
        <p>''He's responsible for his voting record, as we all are responsible for our records, and he'll have to explain it,'' Mr. McCain said on ''Today.'' ''But, no, I do not believe that he is necessarily weak on defense. I do not agree with him on some issues, clearly. But I decry this negativism that's going on on both sides. The American people don't need it, and the end result will be lower voter turnout, particularly amongst younger Americans.''</p>
        <p>Since their bitter duel for the Republican presidential nomination four years ago, the impression has lingered that Mr. McCain and Mr. Bush have little love for each other, and some of their top aides and advisers admit to an active loathing. Mr. McCain backed Mr. Bush strongly on the war in Iraq, but has not hesitated to oppose him on a range of other issues, like tax cuts, global warming and prescription drug benefits for Medicare.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Bush recently named Mr. McCain to the commission assigned to investigate the quality of intelligence used to justify the Iraq War -- a move variously interpreted as an effort to muzzle Mr. McCain on a volatile topic, or lend credibility to the commission, or both.</p>
        <p>In the telephone interview, Mr. McCain, who spent brutal years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam, went out of his way to dismiss any notion that his speaking out was the result of hostility to Mr. Bush. ''There's this continued buzz out there that I do some of the things I do because I'm angry about the 2000 campaign,'' he said. ''My response to that is that I forgave the Vietnamese and have worked for 30 years to heal the wounds of the Vietnam War. If I can get over that, am I going to hold a grudge because of a political campaign? I don't think so.''</p>
        <p>An associate of Mr. McCain's said that the senator was ''committed to making an affirmative case for Bush's re-election, but he is not going to negatively attack Kerry, because he is his friend.'' A Republican official dismissed Mr. McCain's collegial comments as nothing more than ''senatorial courtesy.''</p>
        <p>Terry Holt, the spokesman for the Bush-Cheney campaign, chose to see no daylight between the campaign's views and Mr. McCain's. ''He said that John Kerry's record was a legitimate subject of debate, and we agree completely,'' Mr. Holt said.</p>
        <p>The reality is a bit more complicated. Mr. McCain himself acknowledged in the interview that he should have been more aware that his comments about the vice presidency would produce what turned into an eight-hour firestorm of excited calls, faxes and e-mail messages to his office, and a flurry of fevered comment by pundits.</p>
        <p>''Of course, it's my fault for saying he's a friend of mine,'' Mr. McCain said of Mr. Kerry. ''I understand why it had the impact it did, even though I didn't anticipate it at the time. He is a friend of mine. Guilty as charged. Joe Lieberman is one of my best friends. John Edwards is my friend. Barry Goldwater and George McGovern were good friends.''</p>
        <p>Jano Cabrera, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, confessed that he was hard-pressed to explain why Mr. McCain's polite musing had caused such a fuss. ''I suppose Americans are just easily fascinated by the idea of putting together possible dream teams,'' Mr. Cabrera said, before plunging into a culinary-pop culture metaphor that blended Ben Affleck, Jennifer Lopez and a favorite sandwich. ''But lest we get carried away, let's not forget that for every PB&amp;J we enjoy, we're responsible for a Bennifer.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain's former press secretary, Victoria Clarke, who more recently worked as chief Pentagon spokeswoman for the Bush administration, said the secret of Mr. McCain's ability to stir things up was simple.</p>
        <p>''He's a straight-shooter,'' Ms. Clarke said. ''I've known him since 1983. I'm still amazed at how fresh he is, how sincere he is. Sometimes I make speeches and I find myself starting out by saying, 'Well, honestly, I think such and such.' Only people from Washington have to start a sentence saying, 'Honestly.' There's usually a stilted, packaged, carefully thought-through veneer to everything they say and do. Not John.''</p>
        <p>Those very qualities might make Mr. McCain a poor vice president, as he implicitly acknowledged on CBS on Thursday. ''The vice president has only two duties,'' he said. ''One is to break a tie vote in the Senate and the other is to inquire daily into the health of the president. I prefer being in the Senate.''</p>
