        <p>LEAD: An international agreement to limit production of chlorofluorocarbons and halons will touch off a race in the $2.2 billion industry to develop chemical alternatives that are not hazardous to the earth's ozone layer, officials at several American chemical companies said yesterday.</p>
        <p>An international agreement to limit production of chlorofluorocarbons and halons will touch off a race in the $2.2 billion industry to develop chemical alternatives that are not hazardous to the earth's ozone layer, officials at several American chemical companies said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The five United States manufacturers of chlorofluorocarbons said the agreement would not significantly hurt their sales or earnings because the chemicals represent only a small percentage of their businesses.</p>
        <p>But the chemical industry executives said the agreement - signed yesterday by the United States, the European Community and 23 other nations -would compel them to place more money into research and development. ''Our costs for research and development have already gone up, and they will go up much more,'' said Charles Coe, a spokesman for Allied-Signal Inc. Tighter Supplies Predicted</p>
        <p>Some industry officials said the agreement to limit the production of the chemicals would result in a tighter supply as demand for the products in which they were contained grew. They acknowledged that this would lead to slightly higher prices for the chemicals and the products that contain them, most notably refrigerator compressors, air-conditioning equipment and some insulation materials.</p>
        <p>''When it comes to access, there is going to be an instant shortage,'' said Peter Miller, manager of the chlorofluorocarbon department of the Pennwalt Corporation in Philadelphia. ''The prices are going to get so high that companies will be forced to find alternatives.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Coe said chemical companies would probably study methods of recovering chlorofluorocarbons from old appliances so that they can be recycled rather than released into the atmosphere, as is the case when the products are abandoned. 'Catastrophic' Effect on Industry</p>
        <p>''For us, this thing borders on being catastrophic for our CFC business,'' said Robert L. Jeansonne, a vice president of Kaiser Chemicals, the Cleveland-based subsidiary of the Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corporation. ''It is a business that we've been in for over 20 years, and now it's essentially being phased out.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jeansonne said the larger companies, such as E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company and Allied-Signal, would probably be first in developing substitutes because of their larger budgets for research and development.</p>
        <p>Du Pont executives agreed that the research would be costly and long. ''By our estimates, any substitution will take about seven years to develop,'' said Craig Skaggs, a spokesman for Du Pont, the largest maker of chlorofluorocarbons. ''Because of all the testing, the tremendous amount of toxicology testing you have to do internally and with the Federal Government, it's going to take some time.''</p>
