        <p>Voters who attended speeches by Gov. George W. Bush this week in New Hampshire and Iowa got more than just a handshake, a promise and a heady brush with a political celebrity.</p>
        <p>They got a bound, paperback copy of his collected works.</p>
        <p>''A Fresh Start for America: Policy Addresses of George W. Bush'' brings together Mr. Bush's entire canon: his November reflections on foreign policy (''A Distinctly American Internationalism''), his October musings on education (''A Culture of Achievement''), his July comments on the role of religious organizations in social work (''The Duty of Hope'').</p>
        <p>The latter was particularly compelling, at least according to the journalist Clarence Page, who wrote a column in The Chicago Tribune that raved, ''If it were a movie, it would deserve an Oscar.''</p>
        <p>The reader of ''A Fresh Start for America'' knows this because the book is rife with blurbs and not only on the matte back cover of the 208-page book, but also in between every chapter, one per big speech.</p>
        <p>Never mind that some of the snippets were carefully selected from longer articles or television commentaries that included less flattering observations. The Bush campaign has learned how to use ellipses and to use them well.</p>
        <p>None of these addresses were previously kept under wraps. Each time Mr. Bush gave one, his aides provided journalists with a title, a transcript, a synopsis, short biographies of the academic and political luminaries who influenced it and even their telephone numbers.</p>
        <p>But ''A Fresh Start for America,'' which came out this week, revisits the hits, in a portable volume that allows the more discerning, attentive types of people who vote in state primaries to take measure of Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>The book accurately conveys what the Bush campaign intends it to: that despite his opponents' characterizations of him as vague and weightless, he has clearly stated his views on an array of issues and has put forward several concrete proposals.</p>
        <p>But ''A Fresh Start for America'' is also a near-perfect emblem of the style, methods and gestalt of the Bush campaign, which is amazingly thorough, astonishingly organized, opulently packaged and a bit overemphatic in its response to any insinuation that Mr. Bush lacks the gravitas to govern a nation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush had already produced an election-season autobiography, ''A Charge to Keep,'' written primarily by his communications director, Karen P. Hughes, and distributed by William Morrow &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>So ''A Fresh Start for America'' is a bonus, published by the campaign itself, at a cost of nearly $1 per copy. Aides said that 50,000 copies have already been printed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush held one aloft at an appearance on Thursday.</p>
        <p>''For people having trouble sleeping at night,'' he said, ''I suggest Chapter Three.''</p>
        <p>A Trip of the Tongue And Visions of His Father</p>
        <p>Away from the printed page, Mr. Bush was having a little trouble with eloquence -- or at least pronunciation -- this week.</p>
        <p>Television viewers who watched the Republican debate on Thursday night probably noticed this when Mr. Bush, wearing an expression of apparent satisfaction with the big word he was about to unleash, promised that he would never ''obsfucate'' as president of the United States.</p>
        <p>That is a good thing, because the verb is ''obfuscate,'' and this was the third time in two days that Mr. Bush seemed to mangle it.</p>
        <p>On each occasion, he paused slightly either before or after, the oratorical equivalent of a drum roll or cymbal crash. And on each occasion, it never sounded quite right.</p>
        <p>On Thursday night, it was clear why. He had the consonants mixed up, the letter ''s'' in the wrong place.</p>
        <p>On Friday morning, at an appearance in Rochester, N.H., he was neither obsfucating or obfuscating, but he was conflating the words tariff and barriers into terriers, which he promised to knock down in the name of trade. Would retrievers and spaniels be next?</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush quickly caught himself, which he did not do when, during two previous appearances in New Hampshire this week, he referred twice to ''a post-cold world,'' strangely bypassing the war. Or maybe he was just referring to global warming.</p>
        <p>And Speaking of Father: Let Him Speak for Himself</p>
        <p>These verbal tics -- the exception with Mr. Bush, not the norm -- brought to mind his father, who was renowned for the grammatical and syntactical chaos he made of the English language.</p>
        <p>But former President Bush was hovering over the week's events in other -- and sometimes stranger -- ways.</p>
        <p>His son was reminded repeatedly of his father's famous broken pledge not to raise taxes. (''Read my lips'').</p>
        <p>And it put Mr. Bush in an odd bind. He could not say his father's actions were laudable because that would make his own stated passion for tax cutting seem suspect. But he could not say his father's actions were deplorable because that would make him seem like a cad.</p>
        <p>So he bunted, saying his father and his father's record could speak for itself.</p>
        <p>But what was being said by another record: a rendition of the song ''Cat's in the Cradle,'' which describes a son who vows to grow up to be just like his father?</p>
        <p>It was part of an soundtrack that was put together by the Bush advance team in New Hampshire and blared over speakers at several events. And it seemed to represent the rare occasion when the campaign's attention to detail flagged.</p>
        <p>The point of the song is that the father, too busy with his own ambitions to pay any attention to his son, makes a similarly insensitive man out of him.</p>
