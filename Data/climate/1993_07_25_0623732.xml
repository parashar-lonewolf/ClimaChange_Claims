        <p>THE county government unveiled five vehicles recently at the County Center in White Plains that County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke predicts will put Westchester "on the cutting edge of technology."</p>
        <p>The vehicles, part of the county's fleet of 370 cars, trucks and vans, have been converted to operate on compressed natural gas as part of a six-month pilot program to test the economic and environmental benefits of using natural gas as an alternative fuel. The program is a cooperative effort between the county, the Westchester Chamber of Commerce, Consolidated Edison and Cardinal Resources an oil and gas exploration and production company with headquarters in White Plains.</p>
        <p>"We're kicking off a technology that will be happening over the next years and into the 21st century," Mr. O'Rourke said after driving one of the cars into the County Center. "Fossil fuels are finite, in addition to being a pollution source that we must be concerned about. The natural-gas vehicles operate just like ordinary vehicles, but cost less and are far cleaner."</p>
        <p>According to statistics distributed during the unveiling ceremony, natural gas costs, on average, 40 to 80 cents less a gallon than gasoline. Natural gas produces up to 99 percent less carbon monoxide, almost no sulfur dioxide, no particulates and 85 percent less reactive hydrocarbons than gasoline. Since natural gas burns cleaner, the vehicles also have lower maintenance costs, with an oil change required after every 10,000 to 20,000 miles. Spark plugs on the vehicles can last as long as 75,000 miles.  'We Need Demonstration Programs'</p>
        <p>The technology, its proponents say, can also help local governments and corporations comply with 1990 amendments to the Federal Clean Air Act of 1970, which require a one-third reduction in car emissions and a one-half reduction in truck emissions by 1996. Amendments to that law, passed in 1992, require private organizations or government institutions with centrally fueled fleets of 10 or more vehicles to begin purchasing clean-burning vehicles in 22 cities by 1998.</p>
        <p>"We view the Clean Air Act as having a negative impact on the potential for business development in Westchester," said Harold E. Vogt, president and chief executive officer of the County Chamber of Commerce. "We agree with the law's desire to clean up the air. But we need demonstration programs like this to address the law's provisions with a private and public cooperative effort to develop a viable alternative fuel."</p>
        <p>The county vehicles were converted at no cost to the county, under a grant of $25,000 made by Cardinal Resources to the Chamber of Commerce. The cost of converting all five county vehicles was approximately $20,000, and the remainder of the grant is to be used to promote the conversion program. The approximate cost of converting a regular pasenger car is between $1,500 to $2,500. Under a contract with the county, the chamber then arranged for Alternative Fuels Technologies Corporation of Jamaica, Queens, to perform the conversions. Con Edison offered the county the use of its fueling station in Rye under a contract whereby the county purchases compressed natural gas at a price of about 55 cents a gallon.</p>
        <p>"This is our community," said James J. Boyle, chief executive officer of Cardinal Resources, a company he founded in 1975. "We prospered here and we want to give something back." Mr. Boyle observed that while the United States has an abundant supply of natural gas -- in West Virginia, for example -- the country still imports more than half of its our oil. "A pilot program like this can begin to counter that trend and at the same time send a message," he added. ,  A Domestic Fuel</p>
        <p>There are about 30,000 natural-gas vehicles in the United States today. In Westchester, Con Edison operates 57 of them. The utility plans to convert an additional 12 vehicles in 1993 and purchase 4 new natural-gas vehicles. In its New York service area, Con Edison's fleet included 130 natural-gas vehicles by the end of 1992, a number that is expected to increase to 1,065 by 1998, or 35 percent of the utility's fleet. Con Edison has two natural-gas fueling stations in the county, at its Rye and Eastview service centers.</p>
        <p>"We have been involved with natural-gas vehicles for some time," said Carol Monti Barris, energy service department manager for Con Edison. "The advantage of natural-gas vehicles is that they are safe, clean, economically efficient and, most important, use a domestic fuel."</p>
        <p>The county vehicles chosen to participate in the program are used for road and park maintenance or for county service workers, like visiting nurses and social-service case workers.</p>
        <p>The converted vehicles can go 150 to 200 miles on a tank of natural gas, said Michael Digonis, president of Alternate Fuels Technologies Corporation. "Performancewise, we have an equivalent between a gallon of gas that we buy at a $1.20 a gallon and a gallon of natural gas purchased for 80 cents a gallon," Mr. Digonis said. He added that the main disadvantage to using natural gas was the absence of fueling stations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boyle said that Amoco, in conjunction with a public utility, is involved in a model program in Chicago to build natural-gas fueling stations.</p>
        <p>In spite of its obvious advantages, however, the general public is somewhat reluctant to convert to a gaseous fuel. In addition, bulky canisters are used in natural-gas vehicles, which can cut down on cargo space. And some bridges and tunnels deny access to vehicles carrying bottled gas.</p>
        <p>For the purpose of the pilot program, five similar gas-powered vehicles were chosen as a control. Over the next six months, logs will be kept on both the natural-gas and control vehicles, tracking and comparing performance, maintenance records, fuel consumption, emissions and costs.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Rourke said that the results would then be shared with local governments and corporations in the county. After evaluating the program, the county will decide whether to convert other vehicles, including the county Bee-Line buses or to purchase natural-gas vehicles directly from the manufacturers. At this time, Ford and General Motors produce the vehicles on a custom-made basis at an additional cost to the consumer of $3,000 to $5,000.</p>
