        <p>The initial weeks of the first winter national political campaign in Canada in 25 years had been a tepid affair short on issues and excitement. Then a blunt speech by the American ambassador spiced things up a bit.</p>
        <p>The ambassador, David H. Wilkins, implicitly criticized Prime Minister Paul Martin for chastising the United States on trade and environmental issues as a campaign ploy that was jeopardizing relations.</p>
        <p>In the week since Mr. Wilkins spoke, he has said he did not mean to affect the elections. Regardless, his words have amplified the Canadian-American relations issue and given Mr. Martin a badly needed lift.</p>
        <p>The speech has been viewed by liberal and conservative Canadians alike as an intervention in their politics, spurring some fiery exchanges among the four party leaders during a televised debate last Friday night.</p>
        <p>''Just think about this,'' Mr. Wilkins, a former Republican legislator in South Carolina who is new to diplomacy, told his Ottawa audience. ''What if one of your best friends criticized you directly and indirectly almost relentlessly? What if that friend's agenda was to highlight your perceived flaws while avoiding mentioning your successes? What if that friend demanded respect but offered little in return?''</p>
        <p>He warned of a ''slippery slope'' in relations if the criticisms continued leading up to the Jan. 23 vote.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilkins's remarks were the latest in the verbal jousts between American and Canadian officials over Iraq policy, Canada's refusal to join a North American missile defense system, the White House's refusal to ratify the Kyoto climate protocol and its rejection of a lumber tariff ruling favorable to Canada.</p>
        <p>The American ambassador's comments came shortly after Mr. Martin admonished the United States for ignoring the ''global conscience'' on global warming at a United Nations climate change conference in Montreal earlier this month and staged a photo opportunity with former President Bill Clinton, who is still popular in Canada and has taken Canada's side in a number of issues.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilkins's rejoinder overshadowed opposition speeches and gave Mr. Martin an opening to trumpet his nationalist credentials and divert attention from a Liberal Party scandal.</p>
        <p>Stephen Harper, the Conservative Party leader who normally expresses views sympathetic to the Bush administration, said, ''I don't think foreign ambassadors should be expressing their views or intervening in an election.''</p>
        <p>The day after Mr. Wilkins's remarks, Mr. Martin made an appearance at a lumberyard in British Columbia for a handy backdrop to escalate the ruckus.</p>
        <p>''I am not going to be dictated to as to the subjects that I should raise,'' the normally subdued prime minister said. ''I will make sure that Canada speaks with an independent voice now, tomorrow and always.''</p>
        <p>In the debate on Friday night, Mr. Martin added, ''I call it like it I see it, and if that offends some people then it's going to offend them. But I am going to stand up for Canada.''</p>
        <p>Jack Layton, leader of the social democratic New Democratic Party, shot back, ''What we have seen from Mr. Martin is the picking of phony battles, and when you pick a phony battle you are going to have to deal with the consequences.''</p>
        <p>''It's hypocrisy,'' added Mr. Layton, normally a critic of the Bush administration, noting that Washington had a better record than Ottawa at reducing greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>But a recent poll published in The Globe and Mail showed that 61 percent of Canadians agreed that Mr. Martin had a responsibility to criticize the American government even during a political campaign.</p>
        <p>''The ambassador's comments remind Canadians that the prime minister has stood up to the White House,'' said Desmond Morton, a McGill University historian. ''They have given the Liberals a chance to run on their strength.''</p>
        <p>In an editorial on Friday titled ''The Prime Minister Thumps His Chest,'' The Globe and Mail described Mr. Martin's ''tirades'' as ''a distasteful reminder that it is too easy to exploit latent anti-Americanism in the Canadian soul.''</p>
        <p>Richard Gwyn, a Toronto Star columnist, wrote that Mr. Martin's strategy of using the United States as an issue ''has given shape and purpose to a Liberal campaign that until now has been like a 'Seinfeld' episode -- a campaign about nothing.''</p>
