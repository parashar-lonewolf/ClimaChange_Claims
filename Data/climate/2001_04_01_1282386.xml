        <p>President Bush and Christie Whitman, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, have now definitively abandoned any intention to regulate carbon dioxide from utilities and confirmed that they oppose the Kyoto Protocol, the international treaty to fight global warming.</p>
        <p>Many the world over are speculating on the significance of these moves, some countries concluding they can relax their own efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, others despairing that the United States may not lead on the environmental issue of the era.</p>
        <p>Is there another way to address the problem of climate change while accommodating the Bush administration's concerns about the science and the costs of a climate policy? Is there a conservative response to global warming?</p>
        <p>I believe that a distinctive Bush policy on climate could involve three parts. First, the administration should ask the National Academies of Science and of Engineering to review the scientific evidence on climate change and the availability of energy-efficient technologies -- both issues on which the president has expressed concern. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has recently concluded that anthropogenic emissions have ''contributed substantially'' to warming. The National Academies could be asked to review the panel's findings, along with the state of technologies. In this way, President Bush could fulfill his campaign promise to follow the science on climate.</p>
        <p>Second, the administration should ask the private sector what it can achieve by way of energy efficiency. What is practical and cost-effective, and how quickly can it be done? It is little known, though quite astonishing, that 11 major companies, eight of them American, have committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by a total that exceeds the reductions required of Britain under Kyoto. United Technologies, I.B.M., Baxter, Polaroid and others have committed to improve energy efficiency, or to cut carbon dioxide, by at least 25 percent.</p>
        <p>And those who say these are only commitments should look at DuPont, the nation's largest chemical company, which has already reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent and promises to cut them by 65 percent by 2010. It has also pledged that 10 percent of its energy needs will be met by renewable sources by that time.</p>
        <p>After consulting carefully with companies, the administration should identify realistic goals for the major sectors of the economy. Auto executives, for example, have indicated that their industry cannot make the substantial changes called for by Kyoto in the next seven years but could achieve major improvements in 10 to 15 years. The president needs to get the automobile companies and other important industries to spell out what they can achieve and then commit to these goals.</p>
        <p>Finally, we must realize that very few countries are cutting emissions; most will not come close to equaling the reductions required of the United States by the Kyoto Protocol. Many nations would support the administration if it instead made a convincing commitment to abide by the 1992 international convention to combat global warming -- which President Bush's father signed -- while also agreeing to exceed the goals of Kyoto  over a longer period of time. Such commitments would permit a more orderly replacement of capital equipment and put to rest concerns that energy taxes are required or that electricity supplies would be disrupted.</p>
        <p>President Bush and many in the Senate have decried the Kyoto Protocol's failure to require cuts in greenhouse gases from developing countries. But the United States must have a cogent, credible policy before it can speak with authority to developing countries.</p>
        <p>China, second only to America in its emission of greenhouse gases, has actually reduced its carbon emissions over the past five years. The Chinese, in an effort to curb suffocating air pollution, have reduced coal subsidies, switched to cleaner transportation fuels and converted power plants to natural gas from coal. Helping the Chinese to make further progress could be another distinctive element of the Bush climate policy.</p>
        <p>In sum, there is another way: Review the state of science and technology, involve the private sector, set realistic goals and seriously engage developing countries. This is the path toward energy efficiency and progress on the environment.</p>
