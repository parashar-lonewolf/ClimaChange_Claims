        <p>OUTWARDLY ''Abrams &amp; Bettes'' doesn't differ much from the typical morning or evening chat show. Huddled behind a curving silver desk, two affable, telegenic hosts whip through news headlines, cringe good-naturedly when the other tries a hand at a corny joke, and cut to field reporters who provide updates on leading stories. They even have their own logo and theme music.</p>
        <p>The very modern, niche-marketing twist? All the talk on this talk show is devoted to the weather.</p>
        <p>When most people think of the Weather Channel, they probably envision those ''Local on the 8s'' segments in which current and projected temperatures are accompanied by ocean-blue graphics and congenial jazz fusion. (It's as if it's trying to show that unsettling climate patterns needn't be so alarming.)</p>
        <p>For the channel, though, retaining an audience can be as challenging as holding onto an umbrella in a windy rainstorm. Weather Channel viewers tune in for an average of only 10 minutes at a time. The network's ratings soared during the Hurricane Katrina disaster, but such catastrophes are far from daily events. ''The Weather Channel does extremely well in bad weather, but we don't want to be so weather-dependent,'' said Gus Lalone, the network's managing editor. ''Our job is to make people watch longer.''</p>
        <p>Along those lines the network, which turns 25 this year, has branched out into regular series, like the chilling ''It Could Happen Tomorrow,'' which graphically depicts worst-case possibilities if hurricanes or earthquakes ram into major cities. (Residents of New York City are advised to watch that particular episode at their peril.) ''Epic Conditions,'' in which extreme-sport athletes ply their craft in especially difficult conditions, had its debut March 4.</p>
        <p>The live, hourlong ''Abrams &amp; Bettes,'' though, is the network's most unconcealed attempt to put a face on the network other than Mother Nature's. ''The Weather Channel is an informative and in a sense predictable network,'' admitted Mike Bettes, the Ohio-born meteorologist who is co-host of the show with Stephanie Abrams. ''But with all the competition from other networks and online, we have to do something to keep their attention. We have to give them a reason to watch.''</p>
        <p>Each night the show, subtitled ''Beyond the Forecast,'' works hard to achieve that goal (and fill an hour), sometimes with surreal results. Typical recent installments have featured reports on the deluge of snow in upstate New York (''You can't beat that for compelling television,'' Mr. Lalone said), a segment on a house-size snow melter called the Snowfather (complete with Mr. Bettes's Marlon Brando impersonation) and video of spilled Coca-Cola freezing in subzero temperatures in the Midwest. Footage of snow piles in Oswego, N.Y., was set to hyped-up techno beats.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bettes adapts a regular-guy, no-tie-required demeanor, while Ms. Abrams, who rose through the weather-person ranks in Florida, resembles a less neurotic, and taller, version of Calista Flockhart. ''We think of it as 'Regis and Kelly' with a weather twist,'' Mr. Bettes said. ''And that suits our personalities. I'm like the voice of reason, and Stephanie is a little wacky and vibrant, like Kelly.'' Although Ms. Abrams described herself as ''a total science geek,'' her developing cult may disagree: clips of the show posted on YouTube feature comments like, ''That is one of the reasons I would like to see her in Playboy.''</p>
        <p>Aiming for a younger or at least more tech-savvy viewer, the show's Web site features blogs and viewers' photos, and the nightly broadcast includes an ''Audience Barometer'' question that viewers answer online. ''We're trying to find creative ways to give the weather and the forecast,'' Ms. Abrams said. ''But it's challenging at times.''</p>
        <p>At a time of rampant debate on the environment, it can also be a bit controversial. In one of her recent blogs Dr. Heidi Cullen, host of the network's ecologically minded series ''The Climate Code,'' wrote that ''if a meteorologist can't speak to the fundamental science of climate change,'' then the American Meteorological Society should not give that meteorologist its ''seal of approval.'' Some weathercasters were offended, and in January, Fox News's Steve Doocy remarked, on the air, ''Does the Weather Channel suddenly have a political agenda?''</p>
        <p>Asked if ''Abrams &amp; Bettes'' would address climate-change issues in such a direct, opinionated fashion, Mr. Bettes said: ''The Weather Channel doesn't take a political stance whatsoever. We base our stance on climate change on studies.'' But he added: ''You can't deny that the human contribution to global warming carries some weight. And if we caused it, we have to come up with a cure.'' Ms. Abrams, though, was more cautious: ''We leave that to Dr. Cullen. That's her thing. She's the expert.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Abrams's caution is, in a sense, not surprising; like other talk shows, hers isn't necessarily courting controversy. ''We're trying to find opportunities to make the weather fun,'' Mr. Lalone said. ''The weather isn't always bad news. We cover good-news weather as well.''</p>
