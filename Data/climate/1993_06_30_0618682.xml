        <p>The Whirlpool Corporation was declared the winner yesterday of a $30 million prize for the best design of a refrigerator that both saves energy and is gentler on the earth's protective ozone layer.</p>
        <p>The company used refinements in conventional technology, rather than any radical new approaches, to win the award, which was offered by a consortium of electric utilities.</p>
        <p>Whirlpool, which markets refrigerators under the brand names Whirlpool, Kitchen Aid and Kenmore, beat Frigidaire Refrigerator Products in the finals of a contest known in the industry as the "golden carrot." The company said it would begin selling refrigerators early next year that have none of the chlorofluorocarbon chemicals, or CFC's, used in conventional devices and that will use at least 25 percent less energy than current Government standards.</p>
        <p>Because the $30 million put up by 24 utilities will be used to offset engineering and development costs, the new refrigerators will have prices similar to those of current models in markets served by the participating utilities. In the New York area the utilities include the Atlantic City Electric Company, Jersey Central Power and Light, the Long Island Lighting Company and the Public Service Electric and Gas Company of Newark.</p>
        <p>Whirlpool officials said they expect to sell 250,000 of the refrigerators in 1994 to 1997, the life span of the super-efficient refrigerator program. A spokesman for the Pacific Gas and Electric Company of San Francisco, whose $7 million contribution to the program was the biggest, said customers could expect to save $100 to $150 a year on their electricity bills with the new appliances.</p>
        <p>Because a refrigerator is turned on all the time, it is one of the largest users of electrical power in a typical home, accounting for about 20 percent of total consumption. Refrigerator makers have been struggling to meet Federal requirements for more efficient operation, while also seeking substitutes for CFC chemicals used in the refrigerant fluid and in the foam that insulates the refrigerator. Production of the chemicals is set to cease in 1995.</p>
        <p>A number of radical technical proposals have been proposed, including using vacuum panels instead of foam insulation or controlling pistons in compressors electrically rather than mechanically. But Whirlpool said its new appliance was an extension of conventional technology. Reducing Chlorine</p>
        <p>In the Whirlpool model, the CFC-12 used as the refrigerant in conventional models is being replaced by a compound that has no chlorine. The chlorine in CFC's is regarded as the culprit in ozone degradation. The CFC-11 in the foam is to be replaced by a chemical with less chlorine, but this will probably be banned as well in the future.</p>
        <p>Whirlpool said its design included an improved compressor and better insulation as well as a computer-chip-controlled defrost system that adjusts the length and frequency of power-consuming defrost cycles.</p>
