        <p>Few moments in recent history have been as critical to the health of the American political system as the one that arrives today in Washington. For the next two weeks, the Senate will debate campaign finance reform, focusing on the McCain-Feingold soft-money ban and myriad amendments that would strengthen, weaken or effectively kill it. There is little doubt that Americans would like to jettison the existing system. But in the end the decision rests with lawmakers who think their survival depends on that system. Those who place the public interest above their own will earn history's gratitude.</p>
        <p>Opponents of campaign reform like to say that Americans do not care as much about it as they do about other issues like tax cuts or health care. But Americans who care about such key policy areas must also care about campaign finance reform. As Senator John McCain points out, if voters want the issues to be decided by them and not by soft money, reform is essential. It would be naïve to think that Congress's recent rush to repeal work-safety regulations was not a response to the money that flowed from manufacturers, or that the opposition to limits on carbon dioxide emissions has nothing to do with donations from the mining and energy sectors.</p>

        <p>Few moments in recent history have been as critical to the health of the American political system as the one that arrives today in Washington. For the next two weeks, the Senate will debate campaign finance reform, focusing on the McCain-Feingold soft-money ban and myriad amendments that would strengthen, weaken or effectively kill it. There is little doubt that Americans would like to jettison the existing system. But in the end the decision rests with lawmakers who think their survival depends on that system. Those who place the public interest above their own will earn history's gratitude.</p>
        <p>Opponents of campaign reform like to say that Americans do not care as much about it as they do about other issues like tax cuts or health care. But Americans who care about such key policy areas must also care about campaign finance reform. As Senator John McCain points out, if voters want the issues to be decided by them and not by soft money, reform is essential. It would be naïve to think that Congress's recent rush to repeal work-safety regulations was not a response to the money that flowed from manufacturers, or that the opposition to limits on carbon dioxide emissions has nothing to do with donations from the mining and energy sectors.</p>
        <p>McCain-Feingold does not outlaw campaign donations. Rather it imposes a set of realistic curbs, including a ban on donations to the political parties from unions and corporations, which have been barred from donating to candidates for decades. The bill would also limit the size of individual donations to parties. Another provision would curb fund-raising for campaign ads run by independent groups in the two months before an election. Written by two Republican senators, Olympia Snowe of Maine and James Jeffords of Vermont, this provision would bar corporations and unions from financing obvious election broadcast ads -- defined as  ads that mention the name of a candidate. Individuals could underwrite independently sponsored  ads if they met certain disclosure requirements.</p>
        <p>The White House and other critics claim that the Snowe-Jeffords provision violates free-speech guarantees. But Snowe-Jeffords is based on sound constitutional precedent of regulating money, not speech. Bans on labor and corporate donations and expenditures in federal elections have long been upheld by the Supreme Court. So have disclosure requirements for campaign contributions and expenditures by individuals. As a matter of fairness, the Snowe-Jeffords proposal is also thoroughly evenhanded, affecting groups from labor unions to the National Rifle Association.</p>
        <p>Opponents of reform will also be arguing in favor of an amendment requiring that if any one portion of the bill was found unconstitutional, the entire bill would become invalid. That approach, which President Bush endorsed last week, must be soundly rejected.</p>
        <p>Democrats as well as Republicans need to stand firm on this bill. The recent decision by Senator John Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, to oppose the McCain-Feingold bill is most unfortunate, especially since he is a member of the Senate's leadership committee. Other Democrats, like Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, are wavering.</p>
        <p>More disappointing are President Bush's objections. We hope his initial concerns are not his last word on this subject. He would be making a mistake to think that by repeatedly affirming his own integrity he can escape criticism for supporting soft money and allowing it to influence his decisions. Republicans should be aware that huge rivers of campaign donations will taint their leadership of Congress and Mr. Bush's presidency as surely as they tainted the Democrats in the last four years.</p>
        <p>This is a moment when Americans who believe in cleaning up the system need to pay maximum attention. An opportunity like this one does not come often and must not be squandered.</p>
