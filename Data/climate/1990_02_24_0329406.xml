        <p>LEAD: New doubts about the world's ability to pump enough oil to keep pace with growing demand have convinced many analysts that oil prices will rise much more rapidly than previously expected, by about 50 percent within five years.</p>
        <p>New doubts about the world's ability to pump enough oil to keep pace with growing demand have convinced many analysts that oil prices will rise much more rapidly than previously expected, by about 50 percent within five years.</p>
        <p>Increases are typically passed along to consumers fairly quickly, which means prices for gasoline and heating oil would rise sharply. From 1975 to 1981, a period when a barrel of oil went from about $13 to over $36, gasoline prices in this country more than doubled, from 58 cents a gallon to $1.33.</p>
        <p>Until recently, most oil executives and analysts had anticipated that prices, now averaging about $20 for a 42-gallon barrel, would rise at a rate slightly above inflation during the 1990's, to not more than about $25 a barrel by 1995. But now they say $30 oil is likely by then.</p>
        <p>Many analysts say the supply-demand balance has been shifted by factors including declining output in the United States and the Soviet Union, the world's largest oil producers outside OPEC; moves by newly independent Eastern European nations to buy oil from the Persian Gulf; energy demand in East Asia that is growing far faster than had been expected, and constraints on production arising in the oil-rich Persian Gulf.</p>
        <p>'A Lot of Imponderables'</p>
        <p>The speed of the climb in oil prices ''will catch a lot of people by surprise,'' said Mehdi Varzi, head of energy research at Kleinwort Benson Securities in London. ''By 1995, it is more than likely that we would have $30 oil.''</p>
        <p>George F. Friesen, an analyst at the Deutsche Bank Capital Corporation in New York, said, ''There are a lot of imponderables, but I would say the risk of oil prices spiking is greater now than at any time in the last 10 years.'' He also said $30-a-barrel oil by 1995 is a strong possibility.</p>
        <p>In interviews, about two dozen industry executives, securities analysts, consultants and economists agreed that future price increases for oil might be much steeper than had been predicted even six months ago.</p>
        <p>Many Nations Taking Steps</p>
        <p>A far smaller number disagreed, contending, among other things, that many nations anticipating such price increases are already taking steps to mitigate them, including installing more energy-efficient equipment and switching to alternative fuels like natural gas. These experts also say the Persian Gulf producers will be able to expand production capacity to meet whatever demand exists in five years.</p>
        <p>A surge in oil prices would threaten the economies of major oil-consuming nations like the United States, Japan and West Germany with rising inflation, higher interest rates and slower growth or recession. Many economists attributed the 1981-82 recession in the United States, the worst since World War II, to the sharp increase in oil prices in 1979.</p>
        <p>Within the United States, property values and employment would rise in energy-producing states like Texas, Colorado and Alaska, and decline in the Northeast and Midwest, said Stephen P. A. Brown, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.</p>
        <p>With every $1 increase in oil prices, Texas adds 15,000 jobs and New York State loses 11,000, Mr. Brown said. The nation as a whole loses 78,000 jobs for every $1 rise, he said.</p>
        <p>The nation's trade deficit, which included $49 billion in payments for imported oil in 1989, would soar with rising oil prices. Then, over time, some combination of conservation, a slowing economy, rising domestic oil production and more use of alternative fuels would ease import demand, economists say.</p>
        <p>Because of the change in the supply-and-demand picture for oil, the widely held view now is that the average price for West Texas Intermediate crude, the American benchmark grade, will exceed $20 a barrel this year for the first time since 1985. The price of West Texas crude fell to $21.42 a barrel yesterday, and has remained above $21 throughout the winter even though unusually warm weather has lowered heating-oil demand since the year began. The average figure last year was $19.65, and in 1988 it was $15.98.</p>
        <p>Most analysts expect the price to decline to below $19 a barrel by late March, when demand usually slows.</p>
        <p>Trends Becoming Clear</p>
        <p>But the price could well rise again after that, many industry experts said, because of trends that have become clearer in recent months. For one thing, global consumption has been growing - by an average of more than a million barrels a day since prices collapsed in 1986, to 52.1 million barrels a day last year, according to the International Energy Agency in Paris. Global consumption - excluding the Soviet Union, China and Eastern Europe - is expected to break the 11-year-old record of 52.3 million barrels a day this year.</p>
        <p>Many economists say the rapid growth of demand in the Far East, where many nations' rapidly industrializing economies are growing quickly, will keep demand rising at close to that rate even if United States demand does not grow.</p>
        <p>In Japan, the Government three years ago estimated growth in total energy use at 1 percent a year. But after a surge that put the total above 5 percent in 1988, the Government revised its estimate to an average of 3.2 percent through the 1990's.</p>
        <p>Private economists also expect the growth in energy use in Southeast Asia to average 5 percent a year through 2000. Oil use is also rising rapidly in South Korea, where gasoline demand soared by 27 percent and 29 percent in the last two years.</p>
        <p>Lower Soviet Exports</p>
        <p>Eastern Europe could add three million barrels to demand for OPEC oil in this decade because the Soviet Union, with limited oil available for export, is starting to export less to the former Communist bloc, said David T. Mizrahi, editor of the Mideast Report in New York.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the world's supply-and-demand picture for oil is being changed by falling production in the Soviet Union and the United States. In the last year, those two nations have together reduced output by about 5 percent, or a million barrels a day, to about 19 million barrels a day.</p>
        <p>As a whole, non-OPEC nations -excluding the Soviet Union, China and Eastern Europe - are pumping about 29 million barrels a day, or about the amount they were when oil prices collapsed in January 1986.</p>
        <p>But over the same period the 13 OPEC nations have raised output by nearly five million barrels a day, to an average of 21.7 million last year, meeting virtually all the extra demand.</p>
        <p>Question Is Changing</p>
        <p>Indeed, the question about OPEC is changing from whether the group can limit oil production enough to keep world oil prices at whatever levels it wants, to whether it can expand its ability to pump oil enough to match rising demand, experts say.</p>
        <p>Some analysts say the Persian Gulf OPEC nations - Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia - will be unable to add enough capacity to overcome production declines elsewhere within OPEC. Three other members, Algeria, Gabon and Ecuador, are not expected to be exporting much oil, if any, by 2000.</p>
        <p>OPEC's Secretary General, Subroto, said in Houston this month that OPEC sees demand for its oil rising to 29 million barrels a day in 1995. To meet it, he said, OPEC must expand daily capacity by at least a million barrels in each of the next five years.</p>
        <p>Dr. Subroto, who is from Indonesia, said OPEC must spend $60 billion to add this capacity, and he called on governments, bankers and private oil companies in oil-consuming nations to link arms with the organization on the project. Both sides have a large stake in keeping oil prices stable, he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Subroto's contention is that without some combination of loans, investments and technical help from major oil-consuming nations like the United States and Japan, OPEC may be unable to keep its oil-pumping capacity ahead of rising demand. Western and Japanese bankers and private oil companies are wary of expanding ties with the Arab oil producers.</p>
        <p>Dr. Subroto said OPEC nations fear a sharp increase in prices, remembering the early 1980's, when high prices slashed long-term demand and sent many of their economies into hard times.</p>
        <p>Less Competition for OPEC</p>
        <p>By contrast, analysts say, if oil prices rise only modestly, OPEC oil will face less competition from increased production in non-OPEC nations, where drilling costs are higher than in the Persian Gulf, as well as from conservation and uses of other fossil fuels like coal and natural gas, or nuclear energy.</p>
        <p>The organization's current view is that it can keep demand for OPEC oil growing if prices average $18 a barrel, adjusted for inflation, over the next several years. At current inflation rates, the nominal price for OPEC oil would rise to about $23.40 a barrel in 1995 if OPEC can keep its output matched to growing world demand.</p>
        <p>Many analysts and economists are skeptical of OPEC's assertions that it needs help in expanding its capacity, and question the group's real intentions. And some say the worries about a coming global production shortage in oil are vastly overblown.</p>
        <p>M. A. Adelman, professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, estimated that Arab oil producers could easily finance five million more barrels of capacity from their own revenues at a cost of less than $6 billion. Most of the new production, and money, will come from Saudi Arabia, he said. That nation, already with a fourth of the world's known reserves, recently announced discoveries of large oilfields.</p>
        <p>Philip K. Verleger Jr., an energy analyst at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, said Saudi Arabia could expand its production capacity in five years ''without an enormous capital expenditure.'' Privately, Dr. Subroto has put the total required by Saudi Arabia at $30 billion, a figure many analysts dismiss as extravagantly high.</p>
