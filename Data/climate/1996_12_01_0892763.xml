        <p>FROM LUCY</p>
        <p>TO LANGUAGE</p>
        <p>By Donald Johanson and Blake Edgar.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 272 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>A Peter A. Nevraumont Book/</p>
        <p>Simon &amp; Schuster. $50.</p>
        <p>Not a year goes by without the publication of a spate of books on human origins. They chronicle the exploits of ''The Hominid Gang'' digging for fossils in East Africa, chart the continuing search for those ''Missing Links,'' put humans in their place as ''The Third Chimpanzee,'' give a blow-by-blow account of clashing interpretations of ''Bones of Contention,'' try to fathom the nature of ''The Language Instinct'' and ''The Runaway Brain'' and describe new genetic approaches to tracing the emergence of modern humans in Africa as ''The Search for Eve.''</p>
        <p>These are just a few of the recent titles that reflect the widening range of research in human evolution and the enduring scientific and popular fascination with the subject. They also attest to one incontrovertible fact in this often contentious field. ''The need to explain our origins,'' Donald Johanson and Blake Edgar write in ''From Lucy to Language,'' ''is one of the universals of being human.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Johanson is one of the pre-eminent fossil hunters in paleoanthropology today. He made his reputation with the discovery in Ethiopia in 1974 of a partial skeleton nicknamed Lucy, a small female of the hominid family, which includes human ancestors. Lucy lived 3.2 million years ago and is now the reference point with which other discoveries are compared. She became such a fossil superstar that, as the authors modestly note, she ''is better known than her discoverer.'' Mr. Johanson's writing collaborator, Mr. Edgar, is a writer and editor for the magazine of the California Academy of Sciences. Much of their large-format book is devoted to more than 200 color pictures of early human fossils and stone tools, most of them taken by David Brill, chief photographer of National Geographic magazine.</p>
        <p>Unlike the usual book by a paleoanthropologist, this is not a stirring narrative of hardships in exotic places followed by the triumph of discovery or a defense of a particular point of view on human origins. Quite the contrary. ''From Lucy to Language'' is encyclopedic in scope and style; that can be satisfying but sometimes frustrating. Satisfaction comes from having in one place a concise and authoritative summary of major developments in research techniques and strategies, the accumulating evidence for important steps in human physical and cultural evolution and the struggle to understand the meaning of the many hard-won fossil finds. This is quite an achievement. But one may end up wishing for more -- more flesh and blood to go with the bare-bones exposition, especially regarding conflicting ideas on crucial matters like brain evolution and the emergence of language.</p>
        <p>Still, the book's first section, nearly 100 large pages of text entitled ''Central Issues of Paleoanthropology,'' does not miss much. The authors carefully set the stage by placing humans in context with the rest of the animal kingdom and introducing the bewildering cast of fossil characters, from the newly discovered Ardipithecus ramidus, 4.4 million years old, through the Lucy species Australopithecus afarensis, 3.9 million to 3 million years, to anatomically modern Homo sapiens, which may be no more than 200,000 to 100,000 years old.</p>
        <p>The authors follow current thinking by rejecting the idea, once widely held, that the human family tree could be described as a more or less straight lineage in which A. afarensis evolved into the genus Homo and H. habilis was then superseded by H. erectus, which led to archaic and finally modern H. sapiens. Instead, they write, the fossil record ''suggests that our ancestry is better thought of as a bush, with the branches representing a number of bipedal species that evolved along different evolutionary lines.'' On a bush or tree, as the book points out, the enigmatic Neanderthals still defy classification.</p>
        <p>Nothing is certain about any branching point in the lineage, especially about events between three million and two million years ago, when hominids first started making tools and the genus Homo arose. Scientists are stymied because the fossil record for that period is a virtual blank. Some progress is being made in closing another gap, the one between the earliest known hominid fossils and the probable time when the hominid lineage split off from the one leading to the African apes. Genetic analysis puts that time at six million to eight million years ago. As the book notes, recent discoveries in Kenya and Ethiopia have turned up the first hominid bones earlier than Lucy's species, including some that are up to 4.4 million years old.</p>
        <p>These fossils provide further evidence that upright walking, bipedalism, could have been the first important characteristic, long before a large, complex brain, setting hominids apart from the ape lineage. The authors give an excellent account of the many theories seeking to explain why hominids dropped out of the trees and adopted bipedal locomotion, though they slight interpretations of some evidence that for a long time hominids were equally adept at climbing trees and walking on two legs.</p>
        <p>Other issues summarized in the book include the role of hunting and scavenging among early hominids, the genetic evidence for the origin of modern humans in Africa (as opposed to multi-regional origins) and the influence of drastic climate change on human evolution. On the latter, the authors are less inclined than many other scientists to assign a possibly decisive role to climate, saying the fossil record is too coarse-grained to allow a definite connection between African drought and the hominid-ape split or the emergence of Homo. ''We should also remember,'' Mr. Johanson and Mr. Edgar conclude, ''that hominids seem to have been good ecological generalists, able to tolerate a wide range of environments, and as such they may have been less sensitive to climate change than habitat specialists.''</p>
        <p>One of the book's most useful contributions is a succinct explanation of the techniques applied by molecular biologists, geologists and other scientists in dating critical evolutionary steps and establishing ancient climate and environment. Readers who are not experts in the field may want to have ''From Lucy to Language'' at hand as a reference source the next time they encounter an article or book on the latest news of human origins.</p>
        <p>The same could also be said for the second half of the book, a comprehensive picture album of the hominid family. It includes nearly every significant fossil and artifact discovered to date. Many of the skulls and jaws are reproduced in actual size. Each picture is accompanied by a page or more of text, giving details of the fossil's discovery and interpretation. Even specialists may find the album a convenient reference work.</p>
        <p>A lthough the focus is on physical evolution, Mr. Johanson's specialty, the book gives some attention to cultural innovation, especially in the last 40,000 years, which has contributed to humanity's global success as a species. With no perceptible biological alterations, humans used their large brains and the still mysterious acquisition of language to gain increasing control over their environment. They learned to build shelter against the elements, make clothing in colder latitudes and insure a more reliable source of food through agriculture.</p>
        <p>This treatment of cultural and technological evolution is cursory, but sufficient to support the authors' concluding remarks on the future. Physical evolution is glacially slow; we humans share 98.4 percent of our genetic material with chimpanzees. And if anything, the conditions for significant evolutionary change in the human species, the authors speculate, ''have been greatly diminished, perhaps eliminated.''</p>
        <p>Species usually undergo change when their populations become isolated, but the large, highly mobile human populations today ''have become one giant global gene pool''; also, they are operating ''under the ameliorating influence of cultural evolution,'' which has enabled people to be generally adaptable to new conditions. ''Culture is our key survival strategy,'' Mr. Johanson and Mr. Edgar argue, ''as long as we can keep the planet intact and alive.''
