      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial on Michael Leavitt's departure as Environmental Protection Agency head and new challenges he will face as Health and Human Services Department head; notes many environmentalists express regret at his departure, perhaps out of concern over role reactionary Sen James Inhofe will now play in setting clean air policy</p>

        <p>Michael Leavitt had no time to build a legacy at the Environmental Protection Agency. He replaced the beleaguered Christie Whitman as administrator in late 2003 and now, barely 14 months later, President Bush has whisked him off to run the Health and Human Services Department. He will face many challenges in his new job, but none as ticklish as being the point man on environmental matters for an administration whose policies on this score have been the subject of unrelenting criticism since the day Mr. Bush took office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leavitt leaves behind a good deal of unfinished business, mostly involving air pollution. He had promised new rules governing power plants' mercury emissions, which are currently unregulated. These rules are still in the discussion stage, and there is no telling when, or even if, they will see the light of day. He had also promised to finalize, by the end of this year, vital new regulations governing the smog and soot created by power plants in the eastern half of the United States.</p>

        <p>Michael Leavitt had no time to build a legacy at the Environmental Protection Agency. He replaced the beleaguered Christie Whitman as administrator in late 2003 and now, barely 14 months later, President Bush has whisked him off to run the Health and Human Services Department. He will face many challenges in his new job, but none as ticklish as being the point man on environmental matters for an administration whose policies on this score have been the subject of unrelenting criticism since the day Mr. Bush took office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leavitt leaves behind a good deal of unfinished business, mostly involving air pollution. He had promised new rules governing power plants' mercury emissions, which are currently unregulated. These rules are still in the discussion stage, and there is no telling when, or even if, they will see the light of day. He had also promised to finalize, by the end of this year, vital new regulations governing the smog and soot created by power plants in the eastern half of the United States.</p>
        <p>The White House has pledged to move forward with the rules in Mr. Leavitt's absence. But the more likely possibility is that the administration will seek a legislative remedy in Congress, where James Inhofe, the chairman of the Senate environment committee, has promised to move forward with Mr. Bush's long-delayed Clear Skies plan. This is not necessarily good news. Although Clear Skies aims to broaden the successful market-based techniques that have helped reduce acid rain at a manageable cost -- in theory, a fine idea -- it would also weaken useful regulatory mechanisms contained in the current Clean Air Act, and it would allow more pollution over a longer period of time than would the steady application of current law.</p>
        <p>Allowing the reactionary Mr. Inhofe to set clean air policy would be a disaster. Perhaps with this bleak future in mind, many environmentalists expressed regret at Mr. Leavitt's departure. In particular they praised his willingness to listen and his practical approach to issues.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leavitt will need these traits in abundance in his new job. The next big health item on the Bush agenda may well be reducing the costs of Medicaid, and Mr. Leavitt's main credential in the health care field during his tenure as governor of Utah was that he cut costs at the state's Medicaid program and made it more flexible. But this is an enormously contentious issue. Mr. Bush got nowhere in his efforts to strike a deal with the nation's governors last year, and Mr. Leavitt's reforms in Utah drew mixed reviews. Producing a bipartisan compromise that controls costs without undercutting services may be a bigger test of Mr. Leavitt's managerial and diplomatic skills than anything he faced at the E.P.A.</p>
