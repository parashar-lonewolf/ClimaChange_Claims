        <p>THE Clinton Administration is about to announce its plan for reducing the United States' emissions of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide, in accordance with the treaty it signed at last year's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. And though the plan is still being discussed and officials are closely guarding the details, it appears likely to rely more on carrots than on sticks in seeking to get industry to comply.</p>
        <p>If Government officials, environmentalists and industry representatives who have been involved in creating the plan over the last six months are right, it will contain no new energy taxes, will hold regulation to a minimum and will emphasize and encourage voluntary efforts to use energy more efficiently. The goal is to reduce emissions of so-called greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by the year 2000 in an effort to avert a possible global warming. The announcement of the plan is expected within the next two weeks.</p>
        <p>Energy efficiency is central to controlling emissions because carbon dioxide, the most important heat-trapping gas, is produced by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, the energy foundations of the modern economy.  Some scientists believe a continuing atmospheric buildup of the gases could cause a serious and even catastrophic warming of the earth's climate in the next century. Timetable for Action</p>
        <p>In some ways the Administration's approach is similar to that of the Bush Administration, but with at least two big differences: President Clinton, unlike President George Bush, has committed the nation to a specific target and timetable for reducing emissions. And the Clinton Administration, unlike its predecessor, appears ready to enter the fray as an active participant with industry in trying to speed and expand the adoption of energy-efficient technologies.</p>
        <p>"There are technologies on the shelf now that are sorely underdemployed," said Katie McGinty, the director of the White House Office of Environmental Policy, which is developing the plan. She said the Administration hoped to accelerate the use of those technologies. One likely provision calls for the Government to spend about $200 million a year to stimulate the adoption of such technologies. The Government would also act as a clearinghouse and expediter.</p>
        <p>Among the measures that could be encouraged in this way, for example, is an expansion of the Environmental Protection Agency's "green lights" program, in which the Federal Government provides technical assistance to companies and local governments that agree to install more efficient lighting systems. Energy savings pay for the installation. The plan is said to contain a broad range of such energy-saving measures.</p>
        <p>This general approach would be another example of a developing Administration strategy aimed at encouraging public-private collaboration on a variety of economic, technological and environmental issues. An earlier example was the announcement last month that the Government and the automobile companies were collaborating on the development of an auto three times as energy-efficient as today's cars. Reversal of Bush Position</p>
        <p>Last April, President Clinton reversed the Bush Administration policy and committed the United States to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. At that time, Mr. Clinton instructed his subordinates to come up with a plan that reduced emissions not through more regulation but rather by relying on "American ingenuity and creativity" in producing energy-efficient technology.</p>
        <p>"I think this plan will achieve both of the President's objectives," Ms. McGinty said. She said that while the plan would include "every kind of approach going," the idea of voluntary partnerships would be "a significant part" of the package.</p>
        <p>But can a voluntary plan work?</p>
        <p>"They're going to give it the good college try," said William A. Nitze, president of the Alliance to Save Energy, a Washington-based nonprofit coalition of leaders in government, industry, environmentalism and the consumer movement dedicated to promoting investment in energy efficiency. Mr. Nitze said both he and the Administration were "pretty bullish about the outcome of such a strategy."</p>
        <p>Industry, as might be expected, has supported the general principle. Environmentalists give it mixed reviews, with some faulting it as not having enough of a "hammer" and others approving the general idea. All sides are wary of details yet to come.</p>
        <p>The plan will not rely solely on industry's good intentions, Ms. McGinty said, but will include features that give "backbone" to the partnership strategy. She did not specify the features.</p>
        <p>Some Government officials have acknowledged that there is much uncertainty in the voluntary approach, since it relies on corporate and individual behavior, which is difficult to predict. Because of this uncertainty, the Administration intends to monitor the plan's performance carefully; if it appears not to be working, Ms. McGinty said, further measures will be considered. Close Scrutiny Expected</p>
        <p>There is a substantial foreign-policy incentive for paying close attention and adjusting: the international community will soon be watching the United States, as it will all countries, to determine how well it is meeting its commitments to control heat-trapping gases under the Rio treaty. The Clinton plan stands to be scrutinized closely and critically by other signers of the treaty who are looking to Washington for leadership, not only on this issue but on environmental issues generally.</p>
        <p>It is widely anticipated that the treaty will be ratified by the requisite 50 countries by the end of this year (when the Senate approved the treaty in August 1992, the United States became one of the earliest ratifiers).  The treaty would go into force 90 days after the 50th ratification. If that happens next spring, the scrutiny would probably come a year later.</p>
        <p>While the signers would eventually be required to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions at safe levels, the treaty calls only vaguely, as a first step, for countries to aim at returning greenhouse-gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000.</p>
        <p>The Bush Administration, which feared the economic price of meeting a firm target, refused to accept a specific target and timetable and successfully pressured other countries to go along. In adopting the timetable, the Clinton Administration has taken a first step that goes beyond what is required by the treaty.</p>
        <p>In addition to encouraging the expansion of off-the-shelf energy-saving technologies that might show results by 2000, the Clinton plan is also expected to include provisions through which the Government would help industries speed the adoption, over the long term, of alternative energy technologies now on the cusp of economic practicality. These include, for example, photovoltaic electric cells and advanced wind turbines.</p>
        <p>A disputed provision that is likely to be included in the plan would encourage owners of timberlands to leave trees in place rather than cut them down. Trees and other photosynthesizing plants are "sinks" that absorb carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists look askance at this measure because they believe it would send the wrong signal to other countries. "It tells the Europeans you don't have to deal with your emissions from energy production, that you can offset that by measures on the sink side," said Alden Meyer, director of the program on climate change and energy of the Union of Concerned Scientists, which focuses on energy and environmental issues. In addition, they say, there is no guarantee the trees will not eventually be cut or burned.</p>
        <p>The Clinton plan is not expected to include any provisions for regulating energy use in transportation -- for example, stronger gas-mileage requirements for automobiles. Provisions like that presumably could be brought into play later if the initial proposals do not work.</p>
        <p>The question of whether and how greenhouse emissions are to be reduced further after the year 2000, a concern of many environmentalists, is expected to be discussed but not resolved in the plan. A panel of scientists advising the United Nations and parties to the climate treaty has said that stabilizing the overall atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide at today's levels would require a worldwide 60 percent cut in the 1990 level of emissions. Numbers Are Questioned</p>
        <p>Some environmentalists, like Dan Becker, of the Sierra Club, question the emissions estimates on which the plan is to be based. "The numbers are very squishy," he said. But Ms. McGinty said the plan "has really been put through the wringer any number of ways; the numbers are really solid."</p>
        <p>Dan Lashof, of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said he thought the general approach of "putting together a package of individual initiatives tied together by a commitment to keep track of how those are doing," plus the assurance that stronger measures could be applied if necessary, "is fine."</p>
        <p>But he expressed concern about "what the specifics are, what's in and what's out in terms of actual measures to reduce fossil-fuel consumption, and to what extent the plan may anticipate using credits from the forestry sector to offset growth in the fossil-fuel sector."</p>
        <p>Mr. Meyer's reaction was similarly equivocal. "I think the bottom line is mixed," he said. "There are going to be some individual measures we're going to applaud." But he said the plan, at least from what now appeared to be known, placed too much emphasis on voluntary measures, "with no prospect of hammers or sticks to bring us into compliance if those don't work."</p>
