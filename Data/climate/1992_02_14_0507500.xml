        <p>In Washington folklore, every member of Congress looks in the mirror and sees a President. This week, according to the buzz on Capitol Hill, a few Democrats may be taking a second look.</p>
        <p>A perception is rising among Congressional Democrats that Gov. Bill Clinton's candidacy is badly damaged, and that a groundswell could easily emerge behind one of their own. While some members appear to be warming to former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, none of the Democratic contenders appear to be benefiting much from Mr. Clinton's slippage, at least not on Capitol Hill.</p>
        <p>A familiar cast is repeatedly mentioned, led by Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, Senator Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine.</p>
        <p>Of the four, only Senator Mitchell, the majority leader, goes so far as to declare that he will not run, although he hastens to note that he has been asked.</p>
        <p>"I assume that others have been urged as well," Mr. Mitchell said. Not Slamming the Door</p>
        <p>The other three are not quite slamming the door, and their press secretaries ebulliently volunteer that their employers are being courted by colleagues urging them to jump into the race.</p>
        <p>Representative Dan Glickman of Kansas noted that more than 200 members of Congress would be delegates at the Democratic National Convention, and they couldbe expected to support a colleague if the race opened up. "If Bill Clinton doesn't weather the storm," he said, "you'll see a groundswell for others and the best positioned is Gephardt. But you'd see interest in Senator Bentsen, Senator Gore, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Bradley and Governor Cuomo. My own preference has always been Dick Gephardt."</p>
        <p>Representative Gephardt is not responding to reporters' inquiries about his intentions, his aides say, because he does not want to encourage the speculation that he may reconsider his May 1989 announcement that he would not run.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gephardt's 1988 Presidential candidacy sank after his early victory in the Iowa caucuses, but several members said they thought he had matured since becoming majority leader. On the other hand, some Congressional aides suggested the Missouri Democrat is most popular because members have the most to gain by getting on his good side. Listening but Not Acting</p>
        <p>Another failed 1988 candidate who is being given another look is Senator Gore, who has just published a book on the environment and sponsored a successful amendment calling for a more aggressive United States policy to protect the ozone layer of the upper atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Marla Romash, Senator Gore's press secretary, said: "He continues to get calls from supporters around the country suggesting that he run. He is listening to them but he is not taking any action."</p>
        <p>Senator Bentsen, at a briefing with Texas reporters Wednesday, said: "My answer's the same as it's been all along. And you don't see me up in New Hampshire."</p>
        <p>But today a Bentsen spokesman was not so firm. "He hasn't ruled it out," the spokesman said.</p>
        <p>Members credit Mr. Bentsen with having run an effective Vice Presidential campaign in 1988, and they say he may be the only Democrat who can beat President Bush in Texas.</p>
