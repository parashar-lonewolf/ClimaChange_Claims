        <p>The Bush Administration today opened an international conference on global warming with the declaration that the United States will stabilize its overall production of the gases that have been linked to rising world temperatures.</p>
        <p>According to the Administration's plan, introduced in a 22-page "action agenda" prepared by the White House, the United States will hold down the production of gases thought to cause the earth's warming to roughly 2.3 billion tons annually by the year 2000, the same amount produced in 1987.</p>
        <p>The Administration also said for the first time in an international setting that it believed global warming was a problem.</p>
        <p>The White House is proposing no new steps to hold down carbon dioxide or other gases, however, saying it believes that measures already taken will put a cap on greenhouse gases.  Environmentalists compare this position unfavorably with that of European nations, which have agreed to cut back carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
        <p>"The old White House position was this isn't a problem and we're not going to do anything about it anyway," said Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, an atmospheric physicist at the Environmental Defense Fund in New York. "The new position is yes, this a problem, but we're still not going to do anything about it." Need to Act Now</p>
        <p>Michael Deland, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, told delegates to the international conference today, "Despite huge uncertainty, the potential threat for climate change justifies taking action now," said .</p>
        <p>The Administration's plan and Mr. Deland's call to action came today at the first session of an international meeting to begin work on a treaty to curb emissions of carbon dioxide and several other gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, like the glass panes of a greenhouse.</p>
        <p>The 10-day meeting, which attracted delegates from 130 nations, is the first of 5 scheduled to culminate in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992 with the signing of a treaty to take new economic, environmental and scientific steps to curb the warming. Relief and Derision</p>
        <p>Mr. Deland's remarks and the White House proposal were greeted today with a mixture of relief and derision. Leaders of American environmental groups and some delegates said they indicated a new willingness by the Bush Administration to pursue strategies to reduce the threat of global warming. Other Administration officials, notably William K. Reilly, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, have voiced alarm over threatened global warming, but until now the White House position was that the threat had not been proved.</p>
        <p>The critics of the Administration also noted that the White House proposals appeared to be more of a public relations move because they did not commit the United States to take any actions to reduce carbon dioxide, the most important of the gases involving in global warming. In fact, under the proposal, the production of carbon dioxide would rise by the year 2000 to 1.5 billion tons a year from 1.3 billion tons in 1987.</p>
        <p>Three-quarters of the roughly five billion tons of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere from human activity is produced by the industrialized countries, and the United States is responsible for nearly a quarter of the total. Cut in Chlorofluorocarbons</p>
        <p>The increase in production of carbon dioxide, according to the Bush Administration's plan, would be offset by a reduction in the production of chlorofluorocarbons, a chemical used as a coolant and linked to the destruction of the atmospheric ozone shield. Almost four years ago in Montreal, the United States and other industrialized countries agreed to cut the production of chlorofluorocarbons by 50 percent. Last summer, the same nations agreed to phase out the chemical's production by the turn of the century.</p>
        <p>Dr. Oppenheimer of the Environmental Defense Fund said: "This plan does not commit the United States to anything painful that hasn't been done already. But what is important is that we have a specific plan that the Administration says it's committed to. It's conceptually important that for the first time they are accepting targets. It is significant from a political perspective."</p>
        <p>Before the conference ends on Feb. 14, delegates are scheduled to designate the members of three or four committees that will draft specific recommendations for reducing the threat of global warming. The committees are expected to consider proposals to reduce greenhouse gases and to preserve forests, which absorb carbon dioxide; ways to help less developed nations conform to a treaty, and the proposed legal text of the treaty.</p>
        <p>The United States has proposed that a fourth committee be formed to provide the other committees with the latest research data on global warming.</p>
        <p>Officials of other nations, especially the Europeans, oppose the proposal, saying that the best source of data is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 300 of the world's leading climate experts, organized by the United Nations to provide such research data. National Energy Guide</p>
        <p>As part of its new plan for stabilizing the production of the gases that are linked to the changing climate, the White House today said that it was relying on aspects of its long-awaited national energy strategy. Conserving energy would reduce the production of such gases, the White House said.</p>
        <p>Among the proposals outlined today was a plan by the White House to press for new standards to make appliances more efficient. Such standards could reduce the consumption of energy 7 to 8 percent by the turn of the century, and 15 percent by the year 2010. Large appliances, the White House said, account for more than two-thirds of the energy used in homes.</p>
        <p>The White House also wants to increase its program to train engineers who can audit and improve the consumption patterns of more than 350,000 industrial plants in the United States.</p>
        <p>The Federal Government will also be pressed to come up with new programs to reduce the consumption of energy for lighting. A quarter of the Government's energy consumption is for lighting offices, factories, military bases, and other installations, according to the White House. Improving lighting could reduce the production of the gases linked to the greenhouse effect by an amount equivalent to 1.4 million metric tons of carbon.</p>
