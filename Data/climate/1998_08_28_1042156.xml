        <p>Out of bed. Legs working O.K. Not like when they were running the quarter-mile in high school, but good enough to carry the whole structure all the way to the pills. Took pills. Shaved.

        <p>Diary of another day in the life:</p>
        <p>Out of bed. Legs working O.K. Not like when they were running the quarter-mile in high school, but good enough to carry the whole structure all the way to the pills. Took pills. Shaved. Thought about Presidents. Why everybody make such a big deal about Presidents. Showered. Franklin Pierce supposed to have been a boozer. Got so snookered once that he rode his horse into a tree. So they say. Whoever ''they'' are.</p>
        <p>Bob Edwards on N.P.R. ''Morning Report.'' Terrific diction. Not like Tom Brokaw. Tom really one swell guy, but swallows his consonants. It's Tom who makes the big anchor bucks though. Not Bob. Why anchors paid so much? Local anchors pulling down zillions who couldn't cover a two-alarm fire. The teeth, I guess. Probably go to Anchor University. Take Anchor 101: You will learn how to smile and read teleprompter simultaneously.</p>
        <p>Downstairs. Open four doors. Blasts of wet heat. Gore may be onto something with this global warming stuff. Remember Andre Malraux's book about revolutionaries being thrown into locomotive boilers? ''Man's Fate''? ''Man's Hope''? Read it too late in life to remember it well. Something about Chinese Communists. Wait too long to read a great book and you can't remember it the week after you close it. ''The Leopard'' like that. Read it three years ago. Great great novel. Now can't remember anything about it. Should have read it in high school.</p>
        <p>Who'm I kidding? In high school read Street &amp; Smith pulps, Spicy Detective, Spicy Western, Spicy Whatever. Whatever it was, if it was Spicy I read it. The obligatory Shakespeare too of course. Why have high school on mind this morning? Maybe subconsciously depressed by thought I'll never again run the quarter-mile in 50 seconds. And that's tortoise speed nowadays. Everybody now hyped up on chemicals though. Cheating.</p>
        <p>Brought in morning paper. Clinton, Monica. Lord save us. ''Lord Save Us With James C. Davis.'' Slogan of that Congressman trying to get some ink by running for President back in the 1950's. 1960's maybe? Lord save us with Bill and Monica. From Bill and Monica? Monica, oh Monica! Remember Groucho's song about tattooed lady. ''Lydia, oh Lydia, oh something, something -- Lydia the tattooed lady!''</p>
        <p>Turned on TV. Weather Channel. Yes, once again we will have some weather today. Already having some out there in northern Indiana, poor devils trying to drive to work through those storms. Switched to C-Span. People phoning from all over about Bill, Monica. Monica, oh Monica! Oh have you seen Monica?</p>
        <p>Switched to old-movie channel. John Payne -- John Payne! -- singing ''I'm Always Chasing Rainbows.'' Not at this hour, John. Switched to other old-movie channel. The Warner Oland Charlie Chan. Charlie never the same after Sidney Toler took over from Oland. Toler lacked unction. Switched to CNN. Hurricane, Bill and Monica -- oh have you seen Monica? -- Orrin Hatch. Never thought there'd come a time when Orrin Hatch was the only man in Washington who looked Presidential.</p>
        <p>Squelched TV. Read comics, obits, sports. Has a baseball season ever been duller? Yankees sewed up pennant by Mother's Day. McGwire, Sosa, Griffey hit homers galore but their teams lose anyhow. Everything is exhibition, not competition. Remember when Ted Williams managed the Senators? Finished in first division that year. Only first-division finish for Senators since the Franklin Pierce Administration.</p>
        <p>Finished breakfast, felt rotten about not reading in Gibbon's ''Decline and Fall'' for past three months. Never finish at this rate. Not with old Alzheimer waiting to pounce. Still, have to finish Dickens's ''Our Mutual Friend'' -- 800 pages -- plus Robert Creamer's Babe Ruth bio, plus something by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas provides moral insight. My next Bill-Monica column needs it. Recent Bill-Monica columns very flabby. ''No substance, no urgency, no moral insight, no edge,'' says editor.</p>
        <p>Got to have edge these days. Miles and miles and miles of edge. Probably get away with cribbing Aquinas word for word. Newsroom types never read him anymore. Careful, though. Can't even plagiarize your wife's wisecracks these days without some editor demanding your resignation.</p>
        <p>Trouble is, impossible to stay awake reading Aquinas. Not spicy enough? Why not take a nap first? Then tackle Aquinas after waking up refreshed? Good thinking . . .</p>
