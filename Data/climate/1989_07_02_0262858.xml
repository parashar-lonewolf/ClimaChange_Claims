        <p>LEAD: BUYING TIME by Joe Haldeman (Morrow, $18.95) takes a good idea and fails to develop it. This is all the more disappointing since Mr. Haldeman has distinguished himself in the past for the sensitive exploration of conventional science fiction premises, as in his fine post-holocaust novel ''Worlds Apart.</p>
        <p>BUYING TIME by Joe Haldeman (Morrow, $18.95) takes a good idea and fails to develop it. This is all the more disappointing since Mr. Haldeman has distinguished himself in the past for the sensitive exploration of conventional science fiction premises, as in his fine post-holocaust novel ''Worlds Apart.''</p>
        <p>The title of his new novel is to be taken literally. In the second half of the 21st century anyone with a fortune in excess of $:1 million can buy a complete (if temporary) ''regeneration'' from the Stileman Foundation; the process cleanses the flesh of its accumulated ills and restores the vigor of youth while leaving mind and memory intact. When you need another treatment (after a decade or so), the foundation will provide it on the same terms. The only catch: since you have to sign over all your worldly goods to the foundation each time, you have to keep creating new fortunes from scratch if you want to go on living.</p>
        <p>One would expect the repeat winners in this life-or-death contest to be hard-hitting entrepreneurs and market manipulators in the mold of the age of Reagan. So it is hardly surprising when a group of ''immortals'' tries to take over first the foundation and then the world. Unfortunately, Mr. Haldeman chooses to tell this story from the point of view of two immortals, Dallas Barr and Maria Marconi, whose hearts are pure and whose motives are no more complicated than those of a pair of lovesick yuppies. This is not only incredible on the face of it but reduces plot development to a series of increasingly tedious confrontations between the Good Guys and the Bad Guys. All but buried among the shoot-'em-ups and macho posturings are some provocative near-future details and some trenchant observations on the nature of time, objective and subjective.  *</p>
        <p>Frederik Pohl's new novel, HOMEGOING (Del Rey/Ballantine, $16.95), falls neatly into two parts. The first is set aboard an interstellar spaceship that is home to a species of highly intelligent creatures called the Hakh'hli. Along with the 22,000 aliens on board is a single Earth-type human, a young man named Sandy Washington, who was saved from a disabled space probe by the Hakh'hli and nurtured by them to carry out a vital mission: he is to negotiate with the people of Earth for some raw materials needed by the ship.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pohl is at his best in these opening chapters. The Hakh'hli, whose social organization resembles that of hiving insects, are depicted with affection, even humor. For all their travels, they are ethnocentric to a fault. They despise humanity's self-destructive tendencies - which they know through many years of monitoring commercial television transmissions - and remain blind to their own limitations.</p>
        <p>The Earth that the Hakh'hli must deal with in the second half of the book has been devastated by unchecked pollution (especially the greenhouse effect) and the spread of AIDS. Political structures and the very shapes of the continents have changed. But strangely enough, Mr. Pohl, one of science fiction's most notable social satirists, does very little with this material. He is more interested in the attraction between Sandy (who has never known love or even sex) and a government operative named Marguery Darp, who has been assigned to keep an eye on the Hakh'hli mission in North America. Through her agency Sandy learns some unpleasant truths about his nonhuman benefactors, who in turn learn a thing or two about individual initiative. I only wish the lessons were a little less pat, the ironies a little more biting.  *</p>
        <p>Like Frank Herbert (whose multivolume ''Dune'' series has obviously influenced her), Mary Gentle understands that some stories take time to develop properly. Her ANCIENT LIGHT (New American Library, $18.95) concerns the impact of commercial colonizers from Earth on the ''post-technical'' civilization of the planet Orthe - first introduced in the novel ''Golden Witchbreed.'' The Earth-Orthe parallel is, of course, intentional, but to her credit Ms. Gentle does not set up an easy opposition between happy natives and rapacious outsiders. The Ortheans have more than enough skeletons in their planetary closet; as a species, they are deeply divided, congenitally mistrustful, as much the victims of their own past as of the machinations of arrogant humans.</p>
        <p>The story told in ''Ancient Light'' is that of a gathering storm; decent people on both sides see the danger coming and take steps to avert it, but they are enmeshed in obligations that defeat their purpose. The storm is a long time breaking - the book contains 525 pages, plus maps and appendixes - and there were times when I yearned for the talking to end and for something to happen. But Ms. Gentle's prose has a stolid integrity, and by the time the Ortheans stop talking and start dying, their suffering has taken on a tragic dimension.  *</p>
        <p>Only because I expected so much was I disappointed by the unevenness of Gene Wolfe's recent collection of short stories, ENDANGERED SPECIES (Tor, $19.95). Mr. Wolfe's past achievements include ''The Fifth Head of Cerberus,'' an unforgettable tale of culture shock, and ''The Book of the New Sun,'' a four-volume novel about nothing less than civilization and its discontents. Readers of the latter will recognize the background of two of the 34 stories in ''Endangered Species.'' In ''The Map,'' memory's seductive yet life-threatening undertow is brilliantly dramatized; in ''The Cat,'' motives and actions are so tightly interwoven that I had no idea who was doing what to whom or why.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfe has always demanded a high degree of collaboration from his readers. His writing is allusive, his vocabulary challenging (''virescence,'' ''noctilucence''), his plotting unpredictable. For my taste, he is most successful in the shorter forms when he harnesses his prodigious imagination to a single clear idea - as in the funny, frightening ''When I Was Ming the Merciless'' (about a psychological experiment gone awry) and ''The HORARS of War'' (about what battle does to fighting men). In four connected stories about people who escape from life without quite dying, he effortlessly constructs a mood of Keatsian twilight, only to ''deconstruct'' it in a willful display of stylistic games. At times, he is content to produce clever homages to Poe, Kafka and Borges (three important influences) or, at a still lower level of invention, serviceable tales of domesticated horror in the manner of vintage Ray Bradbury. But even his apparently lightweight creations reward close reading; ''A Cabin on the Coast'' begins as a pleasant tale of supernatural mystery filled with conventional apparatus (a ghost ship, a pact with powerful demons) and builds to a conventional surprise ending that, on later reflection, suggests surprises of a deeper and more disturbing nature.</p>
