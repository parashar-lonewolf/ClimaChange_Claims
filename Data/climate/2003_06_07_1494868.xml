        <p>With just eight days left in the legislative session, Gov. George E. Pataki renewed his calls today for extending a state law that governs the approval of new power plants, adding yet one more item to a growing heap of legislative matters that seem unlikely to be resolved this year.</p>
        <p>In a 55-page bill, the governor sought to refocus public attention on an issue that has divided state lawmakers for more than a year. Article X, which expired on Jan. 1, created a separate regulatory process in 1992 for the approval of power plants that produce at least 80 megawatts of electricity.</p>
        <p>But state lawmakers have repeatedly deadlocked over renewing the law, and few people today saw the governor's efforts as bridging that gap. ''Releasing anything on a Friday afternoon, and so close to the last days of the session, you have to wonder how serious they are,'' said Jason K. Babbie, an environmental policy analyst with the New York Public Interest Research Group.</p>
        <p>On one side, Assembly Democrats have called for major changes that would tighten pollution standards and require impact studies in poor and minority communities where such plants would be placed, while on the other side, Senate Republicans want to renew the law as is. The two chambers passed their respective bills last year, then adjourned without resolving their differences.</p>
        <p>The governor's bill, which he first proposed last year, lies somewhere between the Assembly and Senate positions. For instance, it, too would require studies in poor and minority communities. It would also exempt wind-powered plants from the process, and streamline procedures to encourage companies to replace older power plants with newer ones that pollute less.</p>
        <p>Suzanne Morris, a spokesman for Governor Pataki, said he had been working with environmental groups and the power industry to reach a consensus. ''Our proposal represents a middle ground,'' she said. ''We are hopeful that all of the parties will come to the negotiating table to ensure that we can enact Article X legislation this session.''</p>
        <p>But several legislators and their aides said that the governor's efforts might be too little, too late for this session. The Assembly passed its bill again in March, with Speaker Sheldon Silver listed prominently as a sponsor, but the Senate has yet to act on its bill.</p>
        <p>Assemblyman Paul D. Tonko, chairman of the Assembly Energy Committee, said that the governor's bill was ''dragging to the finish line as the sun is setting.'' Though Mr. Tonko said that he would make every effort to review the governor's bill, he added that it was ''leaving us very scant few days.''</p>
        <p>The Assembly bill, which is supported by many environmental groups, would tighten emission standards for pollutants, including mercury and carbon dioxide for the first time. It would require state environmental and health officials to study the impact of power plants in disadvantaged communities. And it would apply to smaller plants that produce between 30 and 80 megawatts of electricity.</p>
        <p>John McArdle, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, said that the senator would be reviewing the governor's proposals. ''We're open to discussion,'' he said. ''It's one of those issues that we'd like to see agreement on.''</p>
