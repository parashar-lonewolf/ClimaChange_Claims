        <p>You're in the heart of Los Angeles on a miserably smoggy day and decide to do your bit to clean up the air. So you take a drive on the freeway.</p>
        <p>Outlandish as it may seem, the latest idea in the battle to chip away at air pollution is to turn cars into roving air purifiers, devouring any smog that crosses their path.</p>
        <p>This is no visionary fantasy; it is taken dead-seriously by a variety of experts. "It's not a wacky idea," said John H. Seinfeld, chairman of the division of engineering and applied sciences at the California Institute of Technology, in Pasadena. "It's something worth looking into."</p>
        <p>And the markets, which try mightily to resist falling for daydreams, are quite taken with the idea as well. Shares of the Engelhard Corporation -- the developer of the idea -- shot up 31 percent yesterday, rising $9.125, to $38.50, after the company announced its technology on Tuesday. Futures prices for platinum, an integral component of the process, hit a four-and-a-half-year high on the New York Mercantile Exchange, rising $10.60 an ounce for July delivery, to $464.10, its highest price since Sept. 7, 1990.  [ Page D17. ]</p>
        <p>So what's up? Engelhard, an Iselin, N.J., company that in the mid-1970's developed catalytic converters for cars, has now developed a catalyst that would reduce pollution in a whole new way.</p>
        <p>The company has specialized for years in automotive catalysts, the under-car canisters that scrub the exhaust, converting carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides into harmless carbon dioxide and water. Hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides, if emitted freely, can be cooked by the summer sun into ground-level ozone, or smog -- poisonous molecules consisting of three oxygen atoms.</p>
        <p>Now Engelhard is trying to persuade Federal regulators and car makers to add a new catalyst, one that breaks ozone down into a molecule of two oxygen atoms, which is what we breathe. The catalyst works at summer temperatures or on a warm surface; the idea is to paint automobile radiators and air-conditioner compressors with the catalyst so that a car purifies the air that runs under its hood.</p>
        <p>"In Los Angeles they drive 266 million miles a day," said William Rosenberg, a former assistant administrator for air at the Environmental Protection Agency whose air-pollution consulting company is working with Engelhard. "That's a lot of air you could process."</p>
        <p>Outside experts agree that the idea has promise. "It presents us with a great opportunity, beyond zero-emission vehicles," said Mary D. Nichols, the E.P.A.'s assistant administrator for air and radiation, referring to the electric cars soon to be mandated in California. "We can move into negative-emission vehicles." But she said more work was needed to determine costs.</p>
        <p>The idea is in its early stages. At $500 to $1,000 a car, Engelhard said, it would be cheaper than other air-cleaning schemes, especially in California, which in its effort to reduce polluting emissions has clamped down on everything from factories to house paint and deodorant.</p>
        <p>Engelhard said that the fundamental difference between this and other systems was that the car did not purify its own exhaust; instead it destroyed a pollutant in the atmosphere, using nothing but the catalyst and waste radiator heat. It also eats carbon monoxide, a toxic gas produced by incomplete combustion, converting it into carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>While ozone could be anywhere, carbon monoxide is concentrated on roads. The Engelhard system could thus make tailgating socially useful.</p>
        <p>Since ozone is so diffuse -- it is measured in parts per billion -- it is hard to find before it can be destroyed. Engelhard's idea is to piggyback on existing equipment that moves huge volumes of air already.</p>
        <p>Ms. Nichols of the E.P.A. said it might be possible to paint the catalyst onto the radiators of existing cars, rather than apply it only as new cars are built. To work best, though, it would require some changes in cars.</p>
        <p>Radiators and compressors come into contact with huge volumes of air when a car is moving or a fan is running. Dr. Terry Poles, an Engelhard engineer, said the best method would be to reprogram a car's fan to run in peak ozone periods, even if the car was parked.</p>
        <p>Ms. Nichols said home and office air conditioners could be coated, too. But the Federal Government might find it easier to force the change on car makers.</p>
        <p>The Federal limit for ozone is 120 parts per billion, but in Los Angeles it can hit 200. Violations elsewhere are less severe and less frequent.</p>
        <p>According to an Engelhard-commissioned study by Science Applications International, in Los Angeles at peak ozone hours about 10 percent of the area's cars are on the road. If all those had the catalyst, the ozone peak would decline by 1.3 parts per billion; if parked cars worked at it too, the ozone peak would decline by 4.5 parts per billion.</p>
        <p>That pollution reduction is larger than what California would gain from switching to reformulated gasoline, Engelhard said, and compares favorably in cost with other pollution-control methods.</p>
        <p>The national standard for carbon monoxide is 9 parts per million, but some cities record concentrations around 12 parts. Engelhard said its process could knock off 1 or 1.5 parts per million.</p>
        <p>The key to the system is the catalyst, a material that encourages a chemical reaction. But in contrast to the catalysts Engelhard already supplies for cars, this one works at a very low temperature.</p>
        <p>Dr. Poles said the new catalyst would be "easily accepted by the public," since it would hardly be noticed. By contrast, some motorists complain bitterly about reformulated gasoline, and car makers have their doubts that electric cars, another clean-air strategy, will win market approval.</p>
        <p>Engelhard said that it had discussed the idea with only one domestic car maker and that the manufacturer was not ready to say whether it supported the idea.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the Ford Motor Company said yesterday that the company did not have enough information on the process to comment.</p>
