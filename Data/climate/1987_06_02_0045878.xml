        <p>Evidence has been found that humans reached Australia 5,000 years earlier than previously found materials, according to the Australian Government's Science Newsletter. The evidence, stone tools found along the Nepean River near Sydney, is 43,000 to 47,000 years old, scientists say.</p>
        <p>The oldest previously identified site of human occupation on that continent was on the upper Swan River in Western Australia. Thus early human activity spanned the continent.</p>
        <p>When ice age freezing lowered sea levels, a land bridge linked Australia with New Guinea. To reach those land masses, however, human pioneers presumably had to cross open water.</p>
        <p>''Nothing is yet known of the physical characteristics of the people who used the artifacts as no skeletal remains have been found,'' the report said. According to Dr. Gerald Nanson of Wollongong University, people similar to those of today were living in western New South Wales 35,000 years ago. He suggested therefore that the newly found artifacts might be among the earliest examples of the tools used by modern man.</p>
