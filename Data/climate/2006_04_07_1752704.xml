        <p>Maryland is joining a regional consortium of Northeast states committed to reducing smokestack emissions that cause pollution and contribute to global climate change.</p>
        <p>Legislation signed into law yesterday by Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. calls for severely reducing pollution from Maryland power plants that produces smog, acid rain and harmful ozone, while also capping those plants' emissions of carbon dioxide, the chief greenhouse gas.</p>
        <p>Under the new law, Maryland next year will join seven other states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, that agreed in 2005 to reduce carbon dioxide emissions 10 percent by 2019 while establishing the nation's first market system for trading greenhouse gas credits.</p>
        <p>The multistate effort, called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, has been widely seen as an effort to establish a national model that could be followed by other states in the absence of significant action by the federal government to create a national greenhouse gas program.</p>
        <p>Maryland is more reliant on coal-fired power plants than are the other states in the regional pact, and the enactment of such tough pollution control legislation there is considered a major environmental victory.</p>
        <p>Utilities and big businesses have expressed fears that caps imposed by the program will increase the cost of electricity and weaken the reliability of the system. But economic forecasts and extensive modeling done by the states have found that there should be no effect on the supply of electricity and that prices will rise only slightly, if at all.</p>
        <p>Still, having negotiated with the other states for two years, Massachusetts and Rhode Island withdrew from the group in December, citing fears about prices and supplies. When Governor Ehrlich, a first-term Republican, and Maryland utility companies expressed similar concerns about prices, the legislation was amended to require a comprehensive study of reliability and cost issues. If the issues are not resolved, the new law allows the state to withdraw from the regional consortium after Jan. 1, 2009.</p>
        <p>Besides linking Maryland to the regional group's caps on carbon dioxide, the law also sets some of the toughest in-state limits for three other serious pollutants from generating plants. Nitrogen oxide will be capped at 20,216 tons a year by 2009. Sulfur dioxide levels will be limited to 48,618 tons a year by 2010. And mercury emissions are to be reduced 80 percent by 2010.</p>
