        <p>A study prepared by a private contractor estimates that pollution from more than 80 power plants owned by eight electric utilities will cause nearly 6,000 premature deaths in the year 2007. The number is lower than the estimated number of deaths by pollution now because the air is getting cleaner, but the utility industry still cast doubt on the study's credibility.</p>
        <p>The study was conducted by Abt Associates Inc., a technical consulting firm based in Cambridge, Mass. Abt often conducts studies for the Environmental Protection Agency, but this report was prepared for the Rockefeller Family Fund, which among other work supports environmental projects.</p>
        <p>It uses epidemiological studies to project the number of pollution-related deaths in 2007, after some important new clean-air regulations will have taken effect and presumably reduced the level of emissions.</p>
        <p>The study arrived at its premature death figures by determining the number of deaths among people 30 and older in excess of a region's expected mortality levels that could be attributed to an increase in the concentration of pollutants.</p>
        <p>The analysis estimates that in addition to the 6,000 deaths, pollutants from the eight utilities will lead to 140,000 asthma attacks and 14,000 cases of acute bronchitis in 2007.</p>
        <p>The study says that this pollution consists of fine particles of substances like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which can cause respiratory ailments, including lung cancer. The pollution drifts across the country with prevailing winds but falls relatively near home. Thus, plants in Ohio, Kentucky and Georgia, which have traditionally been blamed for acid rain and other pollutants in the Northeast, are also hurting residents in their own states.</p>
        <p>''You don't have to go up to New England before you start to see the health damage,'' said Eric V. Schaeffer, the former chief enforcement officer for the Environmental Protection Agency and now an adviser to the Rockefeller fund.</p>
        <p>Quinn Shea, executive director of environment for the Edison Electric Institute, an industry group, questioned the accuracy of the report.</p>
        <p>''Regarding adverse health effects, we take that claim very seriously,'' Mr. Shea said. ''But, given our experience with these authors, with their data base, with their modeling methodology, we have strong suspicions that this work is not credible.''</p>
        <p>The report is the latest piece of evidence to be introduced into the ongoing public debate over clean air regulations under review by the Bush administration. The administration wants to eliminate some programs and replace them with a strategy called Clear Skies, which, officials say, will reduce pollutants more than the current programs. Environmentalists strongly dispute this.</p>
        <p>The eight companies in the study were: American Electric Power, based in Columbus, Ohio; Cinergy, in Cincinnati; Duke Power in Charlotte, N.C.; Dynegy, based in Houston; First Energy in Akron, Ohio; Sigeco in Indiana; Southern Company in Atlanta, and the Tennessee Valley Authority in Knoxville, which operate a combined 83 power plants. They account for about 8 percent of the more than 9,350 power plants in the country. All eight companies have been cited by the Justice Department as being in violation of the Clean Air Act and are in various stages of legal action.</p>
        <p>The study said the companies that caused the most pollution were, not surprisingly, the biggest -- American Electric Power, with 1,400 projected deaths, and the Southern Company, with 1,200 deaths.</p>
        <p>Mike Tyndall, a spokesman for Southern, said the report used selective data that did not provide a complete picture of the situation. ''It ignores dozens of other peer-reviewed studies that find no association between sulfates from power plants and health effects,'' Mr. Tyndall said.</p>
        <p>The most deaths, 550, are in Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>''The big loser is Pennsylvania, because they're in the wind path,'' Mr. Schaeffer said.</p>
        <p>New York can expect 340 deaths the report said, New Jersey 180 and Connecticut 54.</p>
