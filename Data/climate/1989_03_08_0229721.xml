        <p>LEAD: Twenty countries were reported today to have said they would join an agreement that calls for a 50 percent reduction on production of ozone-destroying chemicals by the end of the century. United States and British officials pledged to help developing countries acquire new technologies to replace the chemicals.</p>
        <p>Twenty countries were reported today to have said they would join an agreement that calls for a 50 percent reduction on production of ozone-destroying chemicals by the end of the century. United States and British officials pledged to help developing countries acquire new technologies to replace the chemicals.</p>
        <p>The developments came as an international conference on protecting the ozone layer of the atmosphere ended without a timetable for a worldwide ban on the production and use of ozone-destroying chemicals.</p>
        <p>The chemicals, certain types of chlorofluorocarbons, are widely used as insulation, refrigerants, aerosol propellants and cleaning agents. They rise into the stratosphere, where they are broken down by sunlight, creating compounds that destroy ozone, which absorbs harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Ozone depletion has been found in Antarctica and the Arctic.</p>
        <p>Scientists warned at the conference about a worldwide increase in skin cancer and eye cataracts that humans would suffer in the next half century from damage already done to the ozone layer. Bush Endorses Idea</p>
        <p>The three-day meeting of 123 nations here began soon after the 12 European Community countries decided last week to go beyond the existing international agreements and phase out the chemicals' production and use by the end of the century. President Bush quickly endorsed the idea of phasing out the chemicals by century's end under an international agreement if alternatives can be found.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, who was the host of the conference, succeeded in one of her major aims to get more countries to agree to sign a 1987 Montreal agreement that has been ratified by more than 30 countries. It calls for a 50 percent reduction by the end of the century in the industrialized countries' production and use of five chlorofluorocarbons, with a longer time for developing countries to reach the same level.</p>
        <p>Nicholas Ridley, the British environment minister, said that 20 countries, including Nigeria, Brazil, Poland, Hungary and Austria - but not India or China - had said at the conference that they would join the Montreal agreement, and that more than a dozen others, including Czechoslovakia, Algeria, and the Asean countries, said they would seriously consider joining.</p>
        <p>But because of concerns by developing countries, as well as some reluctance by the Soviet representatives to commit themselves to further action before studying the latest scientific findings on ozone damage and comparing them with their own, the conference ended without a consensus on whether to strengthen the Montreal agreement or add additional chemicals to be controlled. The agreement freezes the use of halons, used in fire extinguishing systems, at 1986 levels after 1992, but does not include carbon tetrachloride or methyl chloroform, also used in industrial processes. Review Conference in London</p>
        <p>William K. Reilly, the Administrataor of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, said today that because some of the scientific evidence was so new, there was not yet a consensus on speeding up the schedule under the Montreal agreement. The signers are to meet in Helsinki, Finland, in May to decide whether to recommend a tightening of provisions at a full review conference in London to be held in April 1990.</p>
        <p>''We realize the developing world is going to need the whole period between now and the end of the century,'' Mr. Reilly said.</p>
        <p>''The provisions of the Montreal Protocol were criticized by many delegations as not going far enough,'' the report by the conference chairman, Mr. Ridley, concluded. ''There was general acceptance that the ultimate objective has to be the total elimination of production and consumption'' of chlorofluorocarbons and halon gases.</p>
        <p>China, India and smaller nations that want to develop the industries that use such compounds expressed fears that the switch to substitutes by the world's chemical giants could penalize poorer countries or force them to go without refrigerators or electronics industries. Thatcher Speech Praised</p>
        <p>''We shall put greater emphasis on environmental needs in allocating our aid program,'' Prime Minister Thatcher said in a speech. ''Clearly it would be intolerable for the countries which have already industrialized, and have caused the greater part of the problems we face, to expect others to pay the price in terms of their people's hopes and well-being.''</p>
        <p>William A. Nitze, an American Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, described Mrs. Thatcher's speech as ''an excellent initiative'' and said, ''I would hope the development aid of the United States and other industrialized countries would be increased. Some of our assistance, hopefully, will be focused on helping these countries make the transition to benign technologies.''</p>
        <p>American and British officials said that the World Bank would be the most likely agency of channeling environmental aid from the industrial countries to the developing ones, but that they had only just begun thinking about the problem.</p>
        <p>Mostafa K. Tolba, executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, under which the conference was held, called upon the industrialized countries to come up with a plan with real figures.</p>
        <p>He echoed calls made Monday by the Chinese representative, Liu Ming Pu, and the Indian Minister for the Environment, Z. R. Ansari, who suggested the idea of a fund, on top of existing foreign aid, to help the developing countries find and buy substitute chemicals. Mr. Tolba suggested the richer nations could write off some of the poorer nations' debt against environmental expenditures.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Thatcher told the conference that Britain would double its contribution to the United Nations Environment Program, but later, inadvertently did a little better than that. On British Contribution</p>
        <p>Asked at a news conference how much the British contribution now was, she said $:1.5 million, which would double to $:3 million a year (from $2.5 million to $5.1 million a year). When Mr. Ridley, the British environment minister, whispered to her, ''Actually, Prime Minister, it's one and a quarter million,'' or about $2.1 million, Mrs. Thatcher replied: ''Well then, you'd better make it one and a half million immediately. That will teach these people to give me the wrong briefing, won't it?''</p>
        <p>Together the Common Market countries and the United States account for three quarters of annual production and 60 percent of worldwide chlorofluorocarbon consumption of about two billion pounds a year.</p>
        <p>Prince Charles, speaking at a dinner for conference delegates Monday night, said the European decision to end chlorofluorocarbon production by the end of the century was encouraging but 10 years too late. He implicitly criticized Mrs. Thatcher, who has said Britain would reach the goal through voluntary compliance, by saying, ''I do not believe it is enough to rely on voluntary action alone.''</p>
