        <p>LEAD: It is a vast subterranean network, a whooshing, gurgling 6,000-mile iron snake under the streets of New York City, and it is unseen and largely ignored until it erupts like a monster, flooding basements, streets, subways and utility lines as it did twice last week.</p>
        <p>It is a vast subterranean network, a whooshing, gurgling 6,000-mile iron snake under the streets of New York City, and it is unseen and largely ignored until it erupts like a monster, flooding basements, streets, subways and utility lines as it did twice last week.</p>
        <p>Some of New York's water mains date to the Civil War. And while the wooden mains of the early 19th century are no longer in use, more than half the system was laid in a horse-and-buggy era before anyone imagined the punishing vibrations of subways and heavy traffic and the pressure of 1.5 billion gallons a day from within.</p>
        <p>To most New Yorkers, it is taken for granted: The sun rises in the morning and sets in the evening and clean, tasty, odor-free water is always available - 200 gallons of it a day per capita, for bathing, sanitation and a host of water-guzzling appliances in homes, schools, business and industry.</p>
        <p>To Edward C. Scheader, the man responsible for planning and reconstructing it, New York's water-supply system is a thing of beauty, a durable, reliable and harmonious latticework of arteries like those of the human circulatory system. Ode to a Water Supply System</p>
        <p>''You just have to look at it to appreciate the beauty - it's really a magnificent thing,'' Mr. Scheader said in an interview yesterday. ''Think of putting something like that down in a crowded city and have it function so well. There is poetry in it.''</p>
        <p>In 33 years with the Bureau of Water Supply, part of the city's Department of Environmental Protection, Mr. Scheader, now the bureau's deputy director, has helped rebuild much of the system and is regarded as a master of its intricacies.</p>
        <p>While water-main breaks are common - there were 535 in the city last year, or more than one a day - Mr. Scheader noted that major eruptions like those that struck last week at 72d Street and Madison Avenue and at Broadway and 84th Street, causing immense disruptions of life for blocks around, are fairly rare, occurring only a few times a year.</p>
        <p>The worst break he ever saw, he said, was the rupture of a 48-inch main at Decatur Street and Central Avenue in the hilly Bushwick section of Brooklyn five years ago. It sent a wall of water cascading down Decatur onto Evergreen Avenue, which pitched down to Halsey Street, greeting residents there with what looked like a tidal wave.</p>
        <p>''They were five or six blocks away and didn't know what the heck hit them,'' Mr. Scheader said. ''It was tremendous, spectacular.''</p>
        <p>Only when such things happen, stirring discomfort for thousands and headlines in the newspapers, do New Yorkers become aware of a water supply system as vital as a transportation network, as difficult to maintain as a power grid and as unappreciated as an ozone layer.</p>
        <p>''The Mayor points out that it has no real constituency,'' Mr. Scheader said. ''It requires foresight on the city's part to realize that maintaining the water supply system is something that has to be done, even though it doesn't bring people out parading around City Hall.''</p>
        <p>Similarly, the creation of what he called one of the engineering marvels of the world in the 19th century was visionary. Before the 1840's, when the city created its first reservoir at Croton, water distribution was a private franchise held by the Manhattan Company, which later became the Chase Manhattan Bank.</p>
        <p>It was an age of problems related to inadequate water supplies - fires that raged out of control, epidemics of cholera and other diseases bred of poor sanitation and filthy living conditions. The New Troublemaker</p>
        <p>''Going out to Croton was a very bold step,'' Mr. Scheader said. ''There were no automobiles, no radios, no telephones. You're talking about something that was remote.''</p>
        <p>The original mains in New York City were hollowed-out logs a foot or more thick, with 3- to 5-inch holes for the water, said Tina Casey, speaking for the environmental agency and recalling some of the history.</p>
        <p>Buffeted by waves of immigrants and a growing need for water, the city enlarged the Croton system. The Catskill Reservoirs were built from 1915 to 1928, and the Delaware system was placed into service over a 40-year period beginning in the 1920's.</p>
        <p>A receiving reservoir was built in Central Park - the original site was the Great Lawn - and a distribution reservoir occupied what is now the site of Bryant Park and the New York Public Library.</p>
        <p>Cast iron pipe was used for mains as early as the 1840's, and there were no innovations until the 1930's, when engineers began lining the cast iron with concrete to inhibit corrosion, the main villain at the time. But with the coming of heavy subway and surface traffic, a new troublemaker - vibration - had to be faced.</p>
        <p>Since the 1970's, most of the new mains installed in the city have been made of ductile cast iron, which has the strength of the original material but is slightly flexible, making it resistant to the effects of vibration. Insidious Leaks</p>
        <p>The mains are 6 to 84 inches wide, with many cast in 36-, 48- and 72-inch sizes. Besides vibration, extremes of temperature that cause mains to expand and contract are a major cause of breaks, and some are broken by accident, often in digs by utility crews.</p>
        <p>While main breaks are the most visible problem, they are quickly stopped and the loss of water is minimal. Leakage is more insidious and troublesome. A recent survey, Mr. Scheader said, found that more than 9 percent of the water brought into the city was lost to leaks.</p>
        <p>To find and stop leaks, the city relies on calls from the public and a corps of water detectives who ride in six vans with highly sensitive audio equipment and listen for the sound of trickling or running water.</p>
        <p>Only 261 leaks were found last year through calls from the public, but 389 were located and stopped by the electronic water-main snoopers, Ms. Casey said.</p>
        <p>While fixing breaks and leaks are important, the city's principal line of defense is the gradual replacement of old mains. Most of the ancient 6-inch mains have already been replaced with large new pipe that, planners hope, will last into the 21st century.</p>
        <p>''We're planning for the future,'' said Mr. Scheader. ''Enormous amounts of money are being spent to insure that the people of New York City get the finest water service in the world.''</p>
