        <p>Christie Whitman, the odd woman out in the Bush administration, said today that she was resigning as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency because she did not like having a commuter marriage.</p>
        <p>Her 28-month tenure was pitted by tensions within the Bush administration that left her perceived by critics as ineffective. Repeatedly, Mrs. Whitman was caught between administration officials who said she was too willing to press for regulatory remedies favored by environmentalists and environmentalists who accused her of not forcefully advocating their causes.</p>
        <p>She also found herself embroiled in what even Republicans concede were prominent public relations blunders, like an effort to set an allowable limit for arsenic in drinking water that Democrats seized on to portray the administration as careless toward the environment. As a result, she was the object of a long-running Washington parlor game of guessing how long she would last.</p>
        <p>But administration officials said today that she had not been forced out, and Mrs. Whitman, 56, said she was leaving because the thought of staying much longer had no appeal. She said she felt that if she did not leave now, it would not be fair to President Bush for her to depart before the 2004 election.</p>
        <p>Administration officials said they had not settled on a successor. But names circulating among industry and environmental groups include David Struhs, Florida's environmental chief and brother-in-law of Andrew H. Card Jr., the White House chief of staff; Josephine S. Cooper, a former E.P.A. official and now of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers; and Tom Skinner, former Illinois state environmental director who is a regional E.P.A. director.</p>
        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki of New York, who was an ally of Mrs. Whitman in forcing the General Electric Company to clean up toxic chemicals in the Hudson River and had been suggested for the post by some in his party, said today that he was not interested.</p>
        <p>''I worked very hard last fall to have the privilege to be the governor for the next four years, and that's what I intend to do to the best of my ability,'' he told reporters in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Today Mrs. Whitman cast her resignation in personal terms. Life in Washington without her husband, John, a venture capitalist who remained behind at their farm in New Jersey, was too lonely, she said. On those weekends when she was lucky enough to go home, she said, she felt bleak at the prospect of getting on the train Sunday night to return to her Washington apartment.</p>
        <p>''It was sort of like going back to boarding school,'' she told reporters this afternoon in an interview in her suite at the environmental agency during which she looked relaxed.</p>
        <p>''This is the kind of job when you come home at the end of the day, you really like to have someone to sound off to, and the plants just weren't doing it for me,'' she added.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman said she wanted to take time off for a while and then consider her options. She did not rule out some form of public service, and while she sounded unenthusiastic about running for office again, she said ''never say never.''</p>
        <p>A loyal team player to the end, Mrs. Whitman, a former two-term governor of New Jersey, said in her resignation letter, ''I leave knowing that we have made a positive difference and that we have set the agency on a course that will result in continued environmental improvement.'' She said she would stay through June 27. Mr. Bush said in a statement that Mrs. Whitman was a ''trusted friend and adviser'' who served his administration ''exceptionally well.''</p>
        <p>Throughout her tenure, Mrs. Whitman seemed to enjoy the personal trust of Mr. Bush, a fellow former governor with similar blueblood family ties to the Republican Party. Mrs. Whitman, whose father was chairman of the New Jersey Republican Party and whose mother was vice chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, gave Mr. Bush his Scottish terrier, Barney, from her own dog's litter.</p>
        <p>Even so, Mrs. Whitman, a northeast Republican moderate always seemed out of step with this conservative administration. One official said that she was selected for just that reason, to round out the administration's geographical and ideological complexion. Partly because of that, she never won the confidence of the president's conservative base. Nor did she share the pro-industry stance of other appointees.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Mrs. Whitman disappointed environmentalists who expected more of her at the beginning of her tenure. By the end, many environmentalists appeared sympathetic to her as someone who could have little influence in a regulatory agency where the policy and budget are ultimately set by someone else and issues take years to resolve.</p>
        <p>Carol M. Browner, the agency's administrator under President Bill Clinton, said in an interview about Mrs. Whitman: ''At the end of the day, it was probably a bad fit. I think governors generally have a hard time becoming one of many. And regulatory agencies are a unique type of agency, and it's hard to grasp the power and the opportunity of it.''</p>
        <p>Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club, said, ''Under the circumstances, Christie Whitman did the best she could at the E.P.A., but the Bush administration simply wouldn't allow her to do her job.''</p>
        <p>Scott Segal, a partner at Bracewell &amp; Patterson, a law firm that lobbies on behalf of the utility industry, said that Mrs. Whitman had performed with ''grace under pressure.'' He predicted that the administration would have a hard time recruiting someone with Mrs. Whitman's stature, given her turbulent tenure.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman said she told Mr. Card two weeks ago that she wanted to leave and discussed her decision on Tuesday with Mr. Bush in the Oval Office for a half-hour.</p>
        <p>''He did not kiss me on the top of the head,'' she said, alluding to his reaction on Friday to the resignation of his spokesman, Ari Fleischer. ''But he did give me a big hug. I said, 'It's just time,' and he said, 'I know.' He said: 'It's a rough position. It's a rough agency.'' At times, Mrs. Whitman found herself in awkward political positions. Mr. Bush had promised during the 2000 campaign to curb carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, and Mrs. Whitman announced plans to address those emissions, which contribute to global warming. But just days after her announcement, he rejected the Kyoto treaty on global warming.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman said today that her announcement that the administration was reviewing a Clinton administration regulation on acceptable levels of arsenic in drinking water , which prompted ridicule of the administration, had been one of her biggest mistakes.</p>
        <p>''I've been used to some pretty rough politics in New Jersey, but I was really surprised by the vehemence of that,'' Mrs. Whitman said. Ultimately the administration kept the Clinton administration standard in place.</p>
        <p>Asked if she thought that a Republican administration was condemned to an ''eternal fistfight'' with environmental groups, she laughed and said, ''I think that's probably a pretty accurate description of it.''</p>
        <p>In any case, while Mrs. Whitman appeared to try to be a team player, she was burdened by the perception that the administration would not let her be. Even Colin L. Powell, the normally diplomatic secretary of state, once called her the administration's ''wind dummy.''</p>
        <p>''It's a military term for when you are over the landing zone and you don't know what the winds are,'' she said two years ago. ''You push the dummy out the door and see what happens to it.''</p>
        <p>Today, she said, ''I've never felt humiliated,'' but added: ''You can't take any of this personally. It's never been about me.''</p>
