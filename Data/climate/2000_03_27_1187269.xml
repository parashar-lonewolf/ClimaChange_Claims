        <p>Pope's Message at the Wall  Pope John Paul II prayed at the Western Wall, the most sacred site in Judaism, leaving a written message of reconciliation that has been the theme of his pilgrimage, which concluded as he moved from Al Aksa Mosque to the wall and then to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher.</p>

        <p>OPEC Increase Expected  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was on the verge of an agreement to increase its oil production limits by about 1.7 million barrels a day, officials said. The increase, which could reduce the price of oil by several dollars a barrel, is somewhat larger than many analysts had expected.</p>

        <p>Kuwait's oil minister, faced with charges by Americans that Kuwait is enriching itself with high oil prices and forgetting that the United States fought a war on its behalf, responded that today's prices are fair and are just a correction from earlier disastrously low prices.</p>

        <p>Sabotage at Nuclear Plant  Operators of one of Britain's most troubled nuclear fuel processing plants acknowledged, as an international outcry builds for closing the plant, that a saboteur had severed cables controlling robotic operations in a radioactive area. The admission added to a catalog of safety-related problems at the Sellafield plant.</p>

        <p>Mexico Party Accused of Graft  Prosecutors in the northern state of Nuevo Leon say they have collected overwhelming evidence that leaders of Mexico's governing Institutional Revolutionary Party engaged in schemes to divert millions of dollars through dummy bank accounts, including three set up under the names of two maids and a gardener of a top party official.</p>

        <p>Gore to Offer Plan For Campaign Finance  Vice President Al Gore plans today to propose a major change of the federal campaign finance system and will pledge to make its overhaul his top domestic legislative priority. The plan would establish an endowment fund to raise $7.1 billion, and the fund's interest would pay for the general election campaigns for House and Senate candidates if they did not accept money from other sources.</p>

        <p>Artifacts Head to Washington  A business tycoon's collection of Indian artifacts is being trucked to a Smithsonian Institution center in Maryland and will make up the core of the National Museum of the American Indian, scheduled to open next year in Washington.</p>

        <p>Protest at Biotech Meeting  More than 1,500 protesters marched through downtown Boston and ended up outside a major biotechnology industry convention, where they pointed their fingers at the suited scientists watching from the windows and shouted, ''Shame on you!''.</p>

        <p>Close Race for Control of House  The contest for control of the House of Representatives is as close as the margin in the House itself, and the outcome will be hard to predict, since anticipating House elections requires seat-by-seat calculations. One analyst has predicted that the result ''will probably range between a Republican gain of three seats to a Democratic gain of five, one seat short of a majority.''</p>

        <p>Bringing Youth to G.O.P.  That the Republican Party has embraced Gov. George W. Bush, who will be 54 at the time of the Republican convention and was born too late to have been involved in World War II, represents a changing of the guard. And Mr. Bush's youthfulness and the generational shift are keys to why so many leaders believed that he could credibly cast himself as a new-style Republican.</p>

        <p>Years of Risks at Texas A&amp;M  Documents released by Texas A&amp;M University in the investigation of a bonfire collapse in November that killed 12 people show 40 years of uncorrected safety risks, The Austin American-Statesman reported yesterday. Official action to deal with safety was often short-lived and poorly enforced, sometimes because of fear that changes to the revered tradition would upset students and alumni, the newspaper said.</p>

        <p>Acid Rain in Adirondacks Calls Law Into Question  A landmark air pollution law enacted a decade ago to reduce acid rain has failed to slow the acidification of lakes and streams in the Adirondacks, according to a federal report. The study by the General Accounting Office raises sharp questions about the effectiveness of the Clean Air Act.</p>

        <p>Mayor and Police Criticized  Criticism of Mayor Giuliani and the Police Department intensified, the day after police officers and demonstrators clashed at the funeral for the victim of a police shooting. The mayor defended himself and denounced the protesters, and at news conferences and rallies, politicians and community activists called on independent or outside monitors to review police training.</p>

        <p>Flaws Found in Pataki Gun Plan  State legislators, gun industry officials and many gun control advocates say that the wide-ranging gun controls proposed this month by Governor Pataki, while laudable, probably would not produce a large reduction in gun violence.</p>
