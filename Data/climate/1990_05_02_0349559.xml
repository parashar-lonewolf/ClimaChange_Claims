        <p>LEAD: Rich and poor countries reached agreement today on a declaration setting out new priorities for speeding up economic growth in the developing world in the 1990's after a difficult debate that ran longer than expected.</p>
        <p>Rich and poor countries reached agreement today on a declaration setting out new priorities for speeding up economic growth in the developing world in the 1990's after a difficult debate that ran longer than expected.</p>
        <p>The declaration, unanimously adopted by a special session of the United Nations General Assembly, reflects the growing consensus on economic matters in the world since the majority of Eastern European countries abandoned Communism as an economic doctrine and recognized the importance of free markets and private initiative.</p>
        <p>The declaration has no binding force on the nations that accepted it. But like all such United Nations agreements, it serves to record the shifting international consensus on what steps are needed to improve the third world's economic prospects after its generally disappointing preformance in the 1980's, when many poor countries grew poorer still.</p>
        <p>It emphasizes the importance of third world countries adopting sound domestic policies that reduce inflation, promote investment and make their economies more competitive. But it also acknowledges that democracy and the protection of human rights have a role in fostering the third world's economic growth.</p>
        <p>Providing New Markets</p>
        <p>In addition, the declaration recognizes that the political changes under way in Eastern Europe will help the developing world by providing it with new markets and sources of technology rather than absorbing Western assistance which it might otherwise have received. And it sees the safeguarding of the environment as a vital part of the development process.</p>
        <p>Finally, it commits north and south to make a success of a series of international conferences dealing with specific international economic problems.</p>
        <p>Those include the Paris meeting on the problems of the least developed nations in September, the Unicef world summit meeting on children's problems, also scheduled for September, the Uruguay Round of trade freeing negotiations and the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, which will try to draft a new treaty combating climate change.</p>
        <p>''Ideological conflict is yielding to a global approach to the real problems that beset the world,'' Boliva's representative, Hugo Navajas-Mogro, told the closing session on behalf of the Group of 77, as the third world calls itself at the United Nations.</p>
        <p>The Need for New Policies</p>
        <p>Speaking for the Bush Administration, Edward Marks, senior United States adviser to the special session, noted a ''fundamental rethinking'' of approaches to development and said, ''We are seeing a true convergence of views around the need for sound macroeconomic policies, enhanced competition and greater flexibility, creativity, innovation and openness.''</p>
        <p>The consensus outcome came about only after delegates missed their original deadline of last Saturday for an agreement and carried on negotiations until late Monday night.</p>
        <p>But the final consensus, diplomats say, also represents a personal triumph for the United States representative at the United Nations, Thomas R. Pickering, who opposed a skeptical United States Treasury, which originally wanted the United States to boycott the meeting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pickering said at a news conference before the meeting that the United States was taking part only with ''a lot of skepticism and a lot of reluctance'' in Washington because in the past such discussions often degenerated into quarrels between the industrial north and the developing south.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, despite the general climate of compromise, sharp conflicts of interest arose between north and south, particularly over debt and access to Western technology. And for the first time in any United Nations document approved by consensus, today's declaration raises the possibility of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund's granting relief to third-world debtors, something those institutions have refused to do in the past.</p>
