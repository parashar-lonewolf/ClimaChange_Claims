        <p>IT was two years ago, in June 2005, that residents of the Upper West Side got their first glimpse of the two glass-sheathed towers that were to rise on Broadway at 99th Street. The local community board was having its monthly land use meeting -- not generally an occasion of high drama -- and Gary Barnett, president of the Extell Development Company, came to share renderings of his proposed buildings. As he unveiled them, a gasp was heard throughout the room. ''People shrieked,'' recalls Sheldon Fine, chairman of Community Board 7.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barnett had spent millions of dollars acquiring air rights from properties next to his own lots on the east and west sides of Broadway. These air rights, as the neighborhood came to learn, allowed him to build hundreds of feet higher than the 16-story ceiling that defines much of Broadway above 96th Street.</p>
        <p>For those who still didn't grasp Mr. Barnett's intentions, the name he gave his towers was a hint: Ariel East and Ariel West. According to Mr. Barnett, the name Ariel was borrowed from a star. In fact, the only celestial body commonly known by that name is one of the moons of the planet Uranus, but the message was clear. Mr. Barnett aimed high.</p>
        <p>Not since Donald Trump's Riverside South project in the early 1990s, said Mr. Fine, has a set of buildings on the Upper West Side aroused as much opposition as Mr. Barnett's towers. Petitions circulated, gathering signatures by the thousands. Demonstrators took to the streets. None of this, however, did anything to stop the towers. Floor by floor they rose, plywood forms giving way to rebar and concrete, and finally to acres of glass. Residents will begin moving into Ariel East in September and into Ariel West later in the year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barnett is delighted. ''We think they're turning out to be two beautiful additions to the neighborhood,'' he said. ''We think we've got twin stars.''</p>
        <p>Miki Fiegel, a real estate agent who helped lead the fight against the towers and now sees them through her windows, has a different view. ''I think they are two of the ugliest excrescences I've ever seen,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The towers are indisputably high and shiny, mirroring each other across Broadway like curiously tall fraternal twins. Ariel East rises 37 stories, more than twice the height of the buildings at its flanks. Ariel West, on the opposite side of Broadway, is shorter at 31 stories, but still dwarfs everything around it.</p>
        <p>On bright mornings, the towers blaze with sun, sending bolts of reflected light into apartments to the east. To the west, they cast long moving shadows, like binary sundials. And as the neighborhood undergoes its most extensive overhaul in more than half a century, they leave many yearning to turn back the clock.</p>
        <p>''I loved my neighborhood,'' said Ann Shirazi, a social worker who since 1974 has lived around the corner from the Ariel site. ''Now I can't walk from 100th Street to Broadway because I cannot -- I cannot -- look at those buildings.''</p>
        <p>Farewell, Fruit Stand; Hello, Bank</p>
        <p>Like other current hot spots of development around the city, the blocks that run up the West Side between 96th Street and Columbia University lay architecturally dormant for decades.</p>
        <p>Most of the housing stock still dates to the turn of the last century, after the subway came through in 1904, or to the 1920s, when a new wave of construction added 14- to 16-story steel-framed apartment houses. The neighborhood was, in many ways, a nebulous place, lying below the radar of developers and beyond the pale of what trendier New Yorkers consider habitable Manhattan.</p>
        <p>As compensation for grittier streets, quiescent nightlife and the disdain of friends who lived to the south and east, residents got affordable rents, good light, Riverside Park and a remarkably diverse community that, on its better days, resembled an idyllic small town with Broadway playing the role of Main Street.</p>
        <p>''Everybody knew everybody else,'' Ms. Shirazi said. ''Business people. Artists. Musicians. People who were well known, people who would never be known. It didn't matter.''</p>
        <p>For the past decade, gentrification has been burning a steady course up Broadway. Apartment prices have risen to match south-of-96th-Street values. Small businesses have struggled to meet escalating rents. Neighbors count the recently fallen: the Movie Place, La Rosita restaurant, Ivy Books, the fruit stand near 105th, the lumber store on 108th.</p>
        <p>Or they count the banks, 14 of which now line a 17-block stretch between 96th Street and 113th Street. The banks exist apparently to finance the buyers moving into the neighborhood's new co-ops and condos, like the Ariel towers, where apartments priced from $1.6 million to $7.5 million are selling briskly, and where residents will enjoy a swimming pool, a fitness center, a billiards lounge and the current must-have of every luxury building, their own in-house movie theater.</p>
        <p>The Gash in the Ground</p>
        <p>The architectural onslaught now sweeping over the neighborhood puts all the earlier concerns about gentrification into perspective. Even as the Ariel towers reconfigure the Broadway skyline, several new towers are about to rise to the immediate east, in Park West Village, a 2,500-unit superblock complex bounded by Amsterdam Avenue on the west and Central Park on the east, and bisected by Columbus Avenue.</p>
        <p>The most notable addition will be a 30-story apartment building on the west side of Columbus, south of 100th Street. Christened ''the spike'' by neighborhood residents, this tower is to be joined by four low-rise residential buildings and 320,000 square feet of retail space packed into three contiguous blocks. The commercial linchpin will be a 60,000-square-foot Whole Foods Market.</p>
        <p>With excavations under way and years of construction ahead, the 23 acres of Park West Village are undergoing a transformation the likes of which they haven't seen since the 1950s. That was when Robert Moses ordered the demolition of hundreds of row houses to make way for the complex's seven high-rise buildings.</p>
        <p>Developed under the federal urban renewal program and according to the best urban planning of the time, the buildings were arranged around a central mall of grass, trees, playgrounds, benches and parking lots. When the complex opened in the late 1950s, realtors advertised ''the charm of country living in the very heart of the city.''</p>
        <p>''The property had so much open space,'' said Lois Hoffmann, president of the Park West Village Tenants Association. ''Sunshine and trees. Benches to sit on. The wonderful amenities of life.''</p>
        <p>The seven buildings still stand, but the surroundings have changed considerably. Ms. Hoffmann said 40 mature trees, many of them saplings when she moved in 37 years ago, have been cut down on the west side of Columbus Avenue. The tennis courts on the east side have been silenced, the rhythmic plunk-plunk of tennis balls replaced by the steady thrum of excavators across the street. The grocery store where people shopped and the diner where they gathered in the afternoon are gone.</p>
        <p>Instead, a deep gash opens in the ground where new buildings will soon rise.</p>
        <p>To the many sophisticated and politically savvy residents of Park West Village, a hard lesson has been how little control they have over what is to be built around them.</p>
        <p>''I understand property rights; I own property,'' said Paul Bunten, a 20-year resident. ''What has been an eye-opener for me is thatthe developer is allowed to exercise his property rights with no input from the community -- that there really isn't a mechanism for it in these large-scale development programs that have such an enormous impact on the lives of people who already live there.''</p>
        <p>Last month, the real estate executive Jeff Winick, the man in charge of selling commercial property at Columbus Village (as developers are renaming the neighborhood), flew to Las Vegas to attend the spring convention of the International Council of Shopping Centers. It was a fruitful journey. Mr. Winick expects to have 65 percent of the commercial leases signed by the middle of next month.</p>
        <p>''Basically, we're creating a whole new neighborhood,'' he said. ''We really believe we're creating an environment that's going to change the whole area.''</p>
        <p>That, of course, is exactly what worries the people who liked it the way it was.</p>
        <p>'Any Height That Makes Sense'</p>
        <p>The resentment some neighborhood residents harbor toward the developers of these projects -- Mr. Barnett of Extell, Joseph Chetrit and Laurence Gluck at Park West Village -- is raw and often personal. Mr. Barnett argues that it is also misplaced. He has broken no laws in developing his towers, he says.</p>
        <p>''We're developers,'' Mr. Barnett said. ''We'll develop any height that makes sense. We live in a city, a democratic city, where there are city agencies that are proactive and responsive to their communities' needs and desires. They're making the rules. We abide by the rules.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, Mr. Barnett insists, Extell went out of its way to do right with its Ariel towers, and he seems genuinely bewildered by the fact that they are not more widely appreciated.</p>
        <p>''If you compare what was there -- you had really decrepit buildings and a 30,000-foot block in the middle of the Upper West Side that was run-down.''</p>
        <p>Extell, he continued, ''didn't come here and slap down a really ugly brick building,'' one that would have been less difficult and less costly. ''We took great care to try to put up beautiful buildings that would enhance the neighborhood,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For all the anger that buildings can incite, development is seldom a simple tale of good versus evil. One person's eyesore may be another's sight for sore eyes; one generation's architectural debacle could become the next generation's architectural icon. New York development is best appreciated by those with a taste for irony, paradox and unintended consequences.</p>
        <p>The very way of life now cherished by the mostly middle-class inhabitants of Park West Village was made possible only by the displacement of 11,000 people, mostly poor or working class, who were among hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers similarly forced from their homes by mid-20th-century ''slum clearance'' programs.</p>
        <p>The whole history of New York is one of tearing down and rebuilding. A century ago, during the first skyscraper boom of the 20th century, as the population of the city was growing at a rate of 90,000 a year, New Yorkers who left town for any period of time came back to a place they hardly recognized. Many despised the new skyscrapers -- ''monsters of the market,'' Henry James called them in 1907 -- but New York would surely be a lesser city without them.</p>
        <p>And there are good reasons to build tall in New York right now. The city will need hundreds of thousands of new homes if its population is to swell by a million people by 2030, as Mayor Bloomberg recently predicted in his PlanNYC. The greatest need is for affordable apartments, but even luxury buildings like the Ariel towers relieve pressure on the housing market.</p>
        <p>As concerns about global warming escalate, high-rises and high population densities are generally acknowledged to be good for the environment. It is partly for this reason that Judd Schechtman, an urban planner who moved to West 106th Street three years ago, says his neighbors should embrace towers, and stood up at a recent community board meeting to tell them so.</p>
        <p>''New York is environmentally friendly specifically because we are extremely dense,'' Mr. Schechtman said a few days later. ''I think people should open their minds. Especially people who are so progressive and environmentally and socially conscious.''</p>
        <p>Two Churches, Two Strategies</p>
        <p>Ms. Shirazi, the social worker who cannot bear to look at the Ariel towers, recalls how she used to walk the street with her husband and imagine the neighborhood improved. ''We'd look at these beautiful old buildings and we'd say, 'Boy, if these could just be cleaned up,' '' she said. ''But you have to be careful what you wish for. Because the trade-off -- it's like making a pact with the devil. It's destroyed the soul of the neighborhood.''</p>
        <p>A block east of where Ms. Shirazi lives, on Amsterdam and 100th Street, the soul of the neighborhood is entwined in the fates of two churches on opposite sides of Amsterdam, their steeples so close they could almost lean over and touch across the avenue.</p>
        <p>On the east side, facing 100th Street, the century-old Trinity Lutheran Church appears to be in decay. The brickwork and roof are worn and blemished, and scaffolding covers much of the facade. Most glaringly, the stained-glass windows are gone.</p>
        <p>They have been removed and replaced by clear glass, on the advice of experts who warned that the original windows might not survive the excavation about to begin to the church's immediate west, where one of the new Columbus Village buildings will rise.</p>
        <p>According to the Rev. Heidi Neumark, Trinity's pastor, the developers gave the church $100,000 to remove the windows but have provided nothing to replace them after construction ends. Ms. Neumark worries that her financially strapped church will not be able to afford the cost on its own.</p>
        <p>''It feels very tragic,'' she said, contemplating the church's future without its old windows.</p>
        <p>Across Amsterdam Avenue from Trinity Lutheran is St. Michael's, an Episcopal church built in 1890. The roof is newly tiled, the stone walls are clean, the Tiffany stained-glass windows are intact. St. Michael's is flush after selling its air rights to Mr. Barnett -- rights that contributed to making the height of Ariel East possible.</p>
        <p>The church's rector, the Rev. George Brandt, would not disclose how much Extell paid the church but acknowledged, ''They gave us a lot of money.''</p>
        <p>St. Michael's is using some of that money to develop a 12- to 14-story, mixed-use tower on the southwest corner of Amsterdam and 100th Street; the rest will go to preserving church buildings.</p>
        <p>The deal has angered many neighborhood residents and provoked some parishioners to leave St. Michael's in protest. Father Brandt is convinced, though, that he made the right decision.</p>
        <p>''I might do some things differently,'' he said. ''But I felt this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to secure resources for the parish. We're focusing on the future.''</p>
        <p>Changing the Rules</p>
        <p>The shape of that future became a little clearer this month when Community Board 7 voted unanimously in favor of rezoning 51 blocks between 96th and 110th Streets. The change would limit buildings to a height of 145 feet on Broadway -- about 14 stories -- and prevent the transfer of air rights from side streets, effectively preventing anything as tall as the Ariel towers from being built again in the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>The City Planning Commission supports the new zoning, as does Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer. The changes could be in place by September.</p>
        <p>Perhaps it's not surprising that Mr. Barnett of Extell calls the new zoning a bad idea -- ''a classic case of overreaction,'' he said -- but he appreciates one of its ironies. His towers will now command their height, alone and unchallenged, in perpetuity. ''If anything,'' Mr. Barnett said, ''it just makes our views forever.''</p>
