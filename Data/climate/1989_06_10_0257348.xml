        <p>LEAD: President Bush will urge a 10-million-ton annual reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions by public utilities, the chief source of acid rain, as part of a major alteration of the Clean Air Act, senior Administration officials say.</p>
        <p>President Bush will urge a 10-million-ton annual reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions by public utilities, the chief source of acid rain, as part of a major alteration of the Clean Air Act, senior Administration officials say.</p>
        <p>The President will announce on Monday what he has called ''the most sweeping changes in the Clean Air Act since it was last amended 12 years ago.''</p>
        <p>Administration officials and others who have been monitoring the drafting of the legislation said it would also contain a provision for mandating some use of substitutes for gasoline, including methanol and ethanol, as a way to curb smog in urban centers.</p>
        <p>In addition, it will require some technological controls on emissions of toxic chemicals that are now largely unregulated, although how stringent those requirements will be is uncertain. Months of Internal Debate</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's proposal comes after months of internal debate and at a time that the President's advisers remain deeply divided over how stringent to crack down on polluters. Final decisions are being made by Mr. Bush over the weekend, Administration officials said.</p>
        <p>Those officials said the recommendations of William K. Reilly, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, who argued for strong controls on pollution, differed sharply from other Presidential aides, led by Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
        <p>Mr. Darman reportedly warned that stringent antipollution controls would be very expensive and contended that the benefits to public health were questionable.</p>
        <p>The President will offer amendments dealing with three forms of air pollution that are either unaddressed or unsolved by the original 1970 law and the major changes made in 1977: acid rain, urban smog and toxic chemicals in the air. #10-Million-Ton Cut Likely Mr. Bush, who pledged action on acid rain in the Presidential campaign last year, is expected to call for power plants to reduce their emissions of sulfur dioxide by 10 million tons, down from the current 20 million tons a year, in two stages by the year 2000. Power plants that try to achieve the reductions by using still-developing technology that enable coal to be burned cleanly would be given an extra three years to meet the goal.</p>
        <p>Acid rain are emissions of sulfur and nitrogen oxides that come largely from tall smokestacks used to disperse pollution from coal-fired power plants. The emissions have been found to change chemically as they travel long distances through the atmosphere and fall to earth as acidic rain, snow fog or dust. They have been found to destroy plants and wildlife in lakes and streams and to damage buildings and monuments. Such emissions are suspected of contributing to forest damage, and may threaten human health.</p>
        <p>The proposal probably will permit the utilities to decide for themselves how they will achieve the reductions and would encourage the use of market incentives, with permits being issued for a certain level of pollution that could be sold if pollution is reduced below permitted levels. Undecided on Targets</p>
        <p>One issue the President still has to decide is whether to impose the bulk of the sulfur dioxide reduction requirements on 20 of the most heavily polluting power plants, all situated in the Midwest, or spread the requirement over 107 plants around the country.</p>
        <p>Environmental groups have been calling for an annual reduction of 12 million tons in sulfur dioxide emissions. The utility industry and its supporters contend that mandated controls are unnecessary because sulfur pollution has already declined and that clean coal technology will assure future gains.</p>
        <p>The President is expected to back the use of alternative fuels, such as methanol and ethanol, to cut down on the the hydrocarbons emitted by gasoline engines and during the fueling process at service stations.</p>
        <p>The environmental agency recently reported that industry pours 2.7 million pounds of toxic chemicals into the air each year. Many of these chemicals can cause cancer, and others can induce neurological or respiratory illness or produce birth defects in children. Although Congress gave the E.P.A. the responsibility for controlling such pollution when the Clean Air Act was passed, the agency so far has issued regulations for only seven toxic air pollutants. Best Available Technology</p>
        <p>While Mr. Bush's bill is expected to call for the use of the ''best available control technology'' to reduce emissions of these chemicals, the definition of what is the best technology may be too loose to assure substantial progress.</p>
        <p>It was also reported that the bill may not address the issue of accidental releases of dangerous chemicals in the air or the question of what further action will be required if pollution continues to present a high risk to health after the controls are installed.</p>
        <p>Several legislative proposals for changing the clean air law have already been introduced in Congress, but the President's bill is expected to establish the general tenor of the debate. Some members of Congress and environmentalists have said the Administration's legislation will set the floor for new clean air standards on which Congress can then improve.</p>
        <p>Senator Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee's Environmental Protection Subcommittee, which is preparing clean air legislation, said today that the ''absolute minimum'' that would be acceptable for a proposal on acid rain, would be a 10-million-ton reduction in sulfur dioxide by the year 2000. Some Political Consequences</p>
        <p>To deal with the smog problem, Senator Baucus said, there must be new requirments for cutting vehicular exhausts to levels already reached in California, whose antipollution standards for cars are stricter than the Federal Government's. And any plan for dealing with toxic chemicals in the air, he said, must include a requirement for using effective ''best available control technology.''</p>
        <p>In addition to its potential effect on air quality and the nation's economy, Mr. Bush's legislative proposal could have far-reaching political consequences. Because of President Ronald Reagan's opposition to many environmental controls, the environmental issue, once considered largely bipartisan, has been claimed by the Democrats in recent years.</p>
        <p>''Depending on what the President does, the Republicans can get back into the bidding for leadership on the environmental issue,'' Frederic D. Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund, said after he and leaders of other environmental groups met with Mr. Bush at the White House on Thursday.</p>
