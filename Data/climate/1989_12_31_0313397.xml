        <p>LEAD: Acid rain appears to pose a long-term threat to forests, but ozone and natural causes of stress are also implicated in forest decline and may be more harmful to trees in the short run, scientists in a Federal research program have found.</p>
        <p>Acid rain appears to pose a long-term threat to forests, but ozone and natural causes of stress are also implicated in forest decline and may be more harmful to trees in the short run, scientists in a Federal research program have found.</p>
        <p>The research, costing more than half a billion dollars and involving hundreds of scientists for nearly a decade, is intended to produce the Government's definitive assessment of the acid rain problem. It has found that acidic precipitation, as has been widely believed, harms some lakes and streams, mainly in the Northeastern United States, and that this could spread to the Southeast. There Is No Smoking Gun</p>
        <p>In their investigation of the effects of acid rain on forests, however, the scientists say they have turned up no smoking gun. They have found that the problem is far more complicated than had been thought. A variety of natural and other factors combine to harm trees, they say, and sorting out cause and effect is difficult and in some cases impossible.</p>
        <p>The evidence will not be fully evaluated and interpreted until about 700 scientists meet at Hilton Head, S.C., in February, and a final report will not be ready until the fall. But according to interim reports, Congressional testimony and interviews with those involved in the program, certain things are becoming clear.</p>
        <p>The research results ''seem to indicate'' that air pollutants, including acid rain and ozone, ''are indeed a contributing stress that adversely affects forests in several regions of the United States,'' officials of the Forest Response Program at Radnor, Pa., the forestry wing of the Federal research project, said in a recent interim report. The overall project is called the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program.</p>
        <p>Acid rain is a catchall term for rain, sleet, snow, mist, fog and clouds containing sulfuric acid and nitric acid produced by the burning of coal, oil and gasoline.</p>
        <p>Specifically, the Federal investigation has found that acid precipitation appears to rob some forest soils of vital nutrients and to interfere with the ability of trees to absorb those that are left. This, the research suggests, will lead to the widespread stunting of some species of trees at high altitudes in the long term.</p>
        <p>The research has also found that except for red spruces, which account for about a quarter of all trees on the topmost slopes and crowns of mountains in the Northeast, there is no convincing evidence that acid precipitation harms trees through direct chemical contact.</p>
        <p>Far more harmful to forests in the short term, some scientists say, is the ozone produced mainly by automobile and truck exhausts. Acid rain, which comes primarily from power plant emissions, as well as ozone are targets of the Bush Administration's proposed clean-air laws before Congress. The Reagan Administration refused to sponsor any acid-rain legislation pending research of the kind that is now emerging.  Results May Disappoint Some Environmentalists</p>
        <p>The ozone findings, if ultimately borne out by the review at Hilton Head, would appear to put extra scientific weight behind efforts to reduce automobile emissions further.</p>
        <p>In some respects, the research appears to run counter to the expectations of environmentalists who had asserted that acid rain is an unqualified hazard. At the same time, they appear to offer only partial support to industrialists, who say the problem has been exaggerated.</p>
        <p>''For better or worse, you're looking at a mixed bag,'' said Robert I. Bruck of North Carolina State University, a plant pathologist who is working on the Federal project. ''If you're environmentally oriented, you're going to find things to be concerned about; if you're one who finds no reason to get excited, you'll find much to support that, too.''</p>
        <p>The federally sponsored study has apparently confirmed one belief: that acid precipitation has turned some lakes and streams, primarily in the Northeastern mountains, so acidic that much aquatic life cannot survive in them. It concludes that if acid precipitation is not reduced, the acidification could spread to some Southern streams. And the director of the study, James R. Mahoney, has estimated that perhaps half the lakes already acidified could recover if the acid going into them were reduced by 30 percent.</p>
        <p>Less has been known about the effects of acid precipitation on forests than on lakes and streams, largely because intensive research on forests did not begin until 1985. Foresters, environmentalists and commercial timber interests have been eagerly awaiting a scientific reading of the problem.  Scientists Still Debating Their Final Conclusions</p>
        <p>The scientists' conclusions are to be debated among themselves over the next few months. At this point, the Federal project, established by Congress in 1980, is putting the final touches on 28 ''state of the science'' reports describing the research so far that will be made public by mid-January.</p>
        <p>In 1987, the project issued an interim report whose executive summary was widely criticized by scientists who participated in the project on the ground that it distorted the scientific findings and understated the seriousness of the acidification of lakes and streams.</p>
        <p>That report said damage to lakes and streams from acid rain was limited to a few areas in the Northeast and was unlikely to worsen significantly in the next few decades. It also said that there was probably no damage to trees from acid rain except as a minor part of ''multiple stresses'' at high altitudes. Laurence Kulp, who had been director of the program, resigned days after the report was made public. He was succeeded by Dr. Mahoney.</p>
        <p>This time, said Patricia M. Irving, associate director of the project, the results are being subjected to intensive review by peers of the scientists who have done the work.</p>
        <p>The final report of the research project is expected to include, along with the scientific consensus, an analysis of the relative costs of acid-rain damage and the benefits of reducing acid rain.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Mahoney has testified before Congress that reducing sulfur dioxide emissions by the amount required in the President's clean-air bill ''would benefit aquatic resources and would mitigate other environmental effects caused by acidic deposition.''</p>
        <p>Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, both produced by burning fossil fuel, are the major pollutants contributing to the formation of acid precipitation.  Damage to the Forests Occurs at High Altitudes</p>
        <p>The adverse effect on forests takes place mostly at high altitudes, where trees and soil are bathed in fog, clouds and mist much of the time, scientists say, and affects mainly conifers. Hardwoods at lower altitudes appear unaffected, according to the Forest Response Program advisory.</p>
        <p>One of the clearest findings so far, although scientists carefully qualify it, is that acid precipitation is affecting the health of red spruce high in the Northeastern mountains. Many of these trees have died since the early 1960's, and a decline in growth has been reported in the Eastern United States.Frequent bathings in acid mist, clouds and fogs are making the spruce more susceptible to the stress of winter and the drying effect of winds, according to the research findings. No such effects have been found for other species.</p>
        <p>In a striking experiment done under the auspices of the Federal program, scientists at Cornell University's Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research have found that acidic clouds and mist damage red spruce needles, impairing photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert solar energy to food. The study also found that the acid in the mist upsets the trees' nutritional balance. ''At high concentrations it kills the needles outright,'' said Jay S. Jacobson, who directed the five-year experiment.</p>
        <p>Even with such evidence, scientists caution that it is extremely difficult to separate the effects of pollutants like acid rain and ozone from each other and from natural stresses like heat, drought, cold and insect damage. A special committee of the National Academy of Sciences cconcluded the same thing earlier this year, But when the scientific community sees the evidence in the Federal study, it is ''likely to be persuaded that there is strong evidence implicating acid rain in the decline of red spruce in mountain forests of the Northeast,'' said Arthur Johnson of the University of Pennsylvania, who is preparing the project's report on red spruce.  Links Between Pollution And Stress Are Unclear</p>
        <p>In Southern pine forests, which unlike the red spruce forests are among the country's most valuable commercial stands, the Forest Response Program has found that ozone reduced growth and accelerated the aging of needles in some kinds of pine seedlings; and that ozone, along with natural stresses like drought, root diseases and insects, may have contributed to reduced growth of pines in North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia. The interaction between pollution and natural stress remains an unanswered question, the scientists said.</p>
        <p>The studies have also found that in the San Bernardino Mountains adjacent to the Los Angeles basin, ozone has caused visible damage and reduced growth in ponderosa pines and has made them more susceptible to insects and root disease.</p>
        <p>In general, said Dr. Irving, ozone ''is overwhelmingly the most damaging pollutant under current conditions, causing much more damage than any other pollutant to vegetation.''</p>
        <p>But although acid rain's direct effects on forests appear to be limited, some scientists say that its indirect effects may be more widespread and long lasting. By altering the chemistry of mountain forest soil, research indicates, acid precipitation may stunt the growth of a number of tree species.</p>
        <p>It appears to do this in two ways: by depleting the soil of calcium and magnesium, two nutrients necessary for the formation of chlorophyll and wood, and by causing the soil to break down, releasing aluminum. Experiments with seedlings indicate that aluminum inhibits the trees' ability to absorb what calcium and magnesium remain.  Aluminum Levels in Soil Are Near Toxic Levels</p>
        <p>The findings about aluminum are unequivocal, said Dr. Bruck. In some mountain areas, he said, ''we have levels of aluminum being leached from the soil that are reaching toxic levels,'' adding, ''This will disrupt not only the physiology of the tree, but in some cases can kill root systems outright.</p>
        <p>''That almost sounds like a smoking gun,'' he said. ''The problem is that from a short-term decision-making point of view, these processes take a long time to have their effect.'' Dr. Mahoney testified before Congress this fall that the effects might take 50 years to be felt.</p>
        <p>Research is now beginning to focus largely on the interaction of pollutants and natural stresses. For example, an insect called the balsam woolly aphid has contributed to the decline of fir trees in the Eastern mountain forests. ''The bottom line,'' said Dr. Bruck, who has surveyed insect damage to forests as part of the Federal project, ''is that to separate all these things apart and assign an importance value to each one is difficult if not impossible; it simply cannot be done. All these things are acting together, in my opinion, to cause stress.''</p>
        <p>In the policy debate, such a state of affairs can lend support to different points of view.</p>
        <p>George M. Woodwell, the director of the Woods Hole Research Center, who was chairman of the Academy of Sciences committee that investigated the effets of cpollution on trees, said, an owner of a power plant ''might take the position that those scientists are telling us the evidence is not very good, so we'd better have more research.</p>
        <p>''But if you're interested in determining whether there's a problem, from that standpoint it's very clear there is a problem, that the cause is oxides of sulfur and oxides of nitrogen and other toxins, and that the effect is to drive forests and other ecosystems into impoverishment. There is plenty of information, and we know what to do.''  How Acid Rain Blights Forests  The advderse effect on forests takes place mostly at high altitudes where trees, mainly confiers, and soil are bathed in contaminated forg, mist and clouds much of the time.  DIRECT EFFECTS: Only one species of conifer, the red spruce, seems to be directly harmed. Acid rain damages the needles, the tree's factory for producing carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and turning light in to chemical energy; high concentrations kill needles.  INDIRECT EFFECTS: Acid rain depletes the soil of two vital nutrients, magnesium, a constituent of chlorophyll, and calcium, a building block of cell walls, and makes the soil release aluminum, which blocks absorption of remaining magnesium and calcium. This slowly stunts trees' growth and increases susceptibility to life-threatening stresses like heat, cold, drought and insects.</p>
