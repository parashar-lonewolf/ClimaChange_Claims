        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Jared Diamond (''The Ends of the World as We Know Them,'' Op-Ed, Jan. 1) finds cause for optimism in the fact that most of humanity's problems are of our own making. We need only find the political will to face up to the challenges of population and environment.</p>
        <p>Most governments and peoples, however, seem to forget or ignore much of what has been learned.</p>
        <p>The Bush administration rejects the scientific consensus on global warming and sponsors policies harmful to the environment and to population control. Local school boards reject evolutionary science. The mass media titillate more than they educate.</p>
        <p>Many of President Bush's backers and perhaps the president himself expect and look forward to the Apocalypse. Given our current behaviors, we may soon create one.</p>
        <p>Walter C. Clemens Jr.  Boston, Jan. 1, 2005</p>
        <p>The writer is a professor of political science at Boston University.</p>
