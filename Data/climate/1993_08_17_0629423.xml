        <p>Global warming poses just as much of a threat to tropical rain forests, which are already shrinking because the land is being cleared for farms and timber, as it does to the polar ice caps, the World Wide Fund for Nature said today.</p>

        <p>Global warming poses just as much of a threat to tropical rain forests, which are already shrinking because the land is being cleared for farms and timber, as it does to the polar ice caps, the World Wide Fund for Nature said today.</p>
        <p>The group, based in Switzerland, issued its opinion in a report as officials from more than 100 countries met in Geneva to fine-tune the Climate Change Convention, a landmark treaty adopted last year at the Earth Summit meeting in Rio de Janeiro.</p>
        <p>So far, only 31 nations have ratified the pact, but it requires 50 ratifications to go into force. The most conspicuous absentees from the ratification list are the 12 European Community members, which are embroiled in a dispute over the adoption of "carbon taxes" as an incentive to cut back on the burning of fossil fuels. The United States ratified the agreement about a year ago, and was one of the first countries to do so.</p>
        <p>The two-week Geneva meeting is the eighth round of negotiations on the framework convention. The meeting will focus on the financial and scientific rules for the treaty when it eventually goes into force. United Nations officials say they hope that the convention will be ratified by the necessary 50 countries by the end of this year.</p>
        <p>Under the treaty, industrialized nations would aim to stabilize their emissions of carbon dioxide, the main "greenhouse gas," at 1990 levels by the year 2000. Call for Drastic Cutbacks</p>
        <p>But the World Wide Fund for Nature and another major environmental group, Greenpeace, said today that the industrialized world would have to cut carbon dioxide emissions substantially, not just stabilize them, to salvage the planet's delicate environment.</p>
        <p>They singled out the European Community for special criticism because those nations have failed to ratify the treaty even though they publicly backed it before the summit meeting last year.</p>
        <p>"They said three years ago that they're going to be a leader on climate change, but they've done nothing since." said a Greenpeace spokeswoman, Desley Mather. "They're rapidly losing all credibility on climate issues."</p>
        <p>Ms. Mather was speaking as Greenpeace set in motion a specially designed carbon clock to keep track of the 42,000 tons of carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere each minute from burning oil, gas and coal. When the clock began running, it started at 22 billion tons, which is the amount of carbon that has been pumped into the atmosphere since the treaty was signed in June 1992.</p>
        <p>The World Wide Fund for Nature report, entitled "Some Like it Hot," was billed as the first comprehensive review of the threat posed by the global warming to plants and animals around the world. Tropical Risk Is Cited</p>
        <p>The report says the survival of species is threatened in all the planet's major biological systems. However, coral reefs, mangrove swamps and river banks are most at risk because water levels will rise if the polar icecaps melt, the reported adds.</p>
        <p>Global warming's threat to reefs, islands and Arctic wildlife species, like the polar bear, has been well documented, the report says, and scientists are predicting the greatest rise in temperatures for the higher latitudes.</p>
        <p>But the report says an early victim of climate change would be the complex ecosystems in tropical forests. That would not come because of rising temperatures, the report says; instead, the perturbation would be due to disruptions in weather patterns and the increased likelihood of hurricanes.</p>
        <p>It warns that the cloud caps could disappear from the tops of some tropical mountains, threatening unique species that live in the cloud forests of Peru, Costa Rica, Malaysia, Indonesia and China.</p>
        <p>The report says: "It has often been assumed that because predicted global warming will be much less near the equator than near the poles, tropical forests will be largely unaffected.</p>
        <p>"Increasingly, it is being recognized that other climatic factors, including changes in rainfall patterns and the frequency and intensity of hurricanes, cyclones and wildfire, may have far greater consequences than a rise in temperature."</p>
