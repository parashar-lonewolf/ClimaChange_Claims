        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You report that James E. Hansen, the top climate scientist at NASA, says the administration is trying to silence him on the risks of global warming. The article suggests that government agency restrictions on public statements by employees are exceptional, but they are not.</p>
        <p>In more than 30 years of federal employment, I have always found it a clearly articulated policy that all employee presentations -- even those unrelated to the agency's mission -- were subject to management approval.</p>
        <p>These policies exist, although they may be offensive to some or applied inconsistently.</p>
        <p>After almost 40 years of federal service, Dr. Hansen is probably eligible to retire on a substantial pension. That would allow him to speak and publish freely with no question of censorship and bring to the fore his disagreement with the administration.</p>
