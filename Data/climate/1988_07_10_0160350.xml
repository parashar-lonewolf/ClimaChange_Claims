        <p>LEAD: WHEN you buy a fishing license from New York State, you get an unusual warning with it: The fish you catch should be eaten sparingly, if at all.</p>
        <p>WHEN you buy a fishing license from New York State, you get an unusual warning with it: The fish you catch should be eaten sparingly, if at all.</p>
        <p>Over the last few years, the warnings have grown more restrictive. Inevitably, anglers must wonder: What are they trying to tell us about the water we want to fish in?</p>
        <p>In fact, the warnings are intended to provide a larger margin of safety for people who eat game fish. They say nothing about water quality in streams and lakes, which, experts agree, has steadily improved.</p>
        <p>The region's salt waters may be a different story. Popular beaches on Long Island's South Shore were closed last week because they were strewn with trash and sewage. Last month, thousands of dead eels, bass, flounders and crabs washed ashore from New Jersey's Sandy Hook Bay; blooms of algae have been a recurring plague to shellfish in Long Island bays and the Sound. ''The environment is trying to tell us something,'' said Dr. Stuart Wilk of the National Marine Fisheries Service center at Sandy Hook.</p>
        <p>Several theories have been advanced as to what the ''something'' is, but it is unlikely to be directly linked to the condition of freshwater systems. Gordon Colvin, director of the state's Division of Marine Resources, said, ''The problems in salt water are primarily connected with low oxygen content that suffocates fish, and blooms of algae that are toxic to them. Neither of those two threats is as important today in New York State's fresh water, thanks to a largely successful effort to reduce discharges of pollution.''</p>
        <p>James Colquhoun, the state official who oversees protection of freshwater fisheries, agreed that readily identifiable polluters, like sewer outfalls and factories, have been dealt with. Now, he said, acid rain, which does not harm humans, is ''of far greater significance to our fishery.'' The state reported last week that more than a quarter of the lakes in the Adirondacks were too acidic to support fish.</p>
        <p>As for risks to human health, Mr. Colquhoun said the major remaining problems were contaminated runoff, which is hard to trace to its source, and PCBs and heavy metals deposited in stream beds years ago.</p>
        <p>PCBs, now-banned organic chemicals that were once widely used for lubrication and insulation, were a primary reason the state issued the fish-consumption warnings. The warnings range in severity from a dire ''EAT NONE,'' applied to specific species caught in specific waters, to the mild caution that applies to every sport fish - unglamorous species like the American eel and the carp, as well as stars of the piscine galaxy, trout and salmon and even the rare trophy tiger muskellunge - that is caught in any New York lake or stream: ''EAT NO MORE THAN ONE MEAL A WEEK.''</p>
        <p>In the 1985-86 fishing season, there was no such general warning. Specific recommendations have been tightened, too. In 1985-86, for example, the caution against eating fish from Lake Champlain applied only to American eels and brown bullheads; this year, the list carried a stern warning not to eat lake trout more than once a month. There are stepped-up warnings as well on walleyes from the Hudson River south of Troy (EAT NONE), Lake Erie catfish (NO MORE THAN ONE MEAL MONTHLY) and smallmouth bass from the Salmon River (EAT NONE).</p>
        <p>It is the State Department of Health that determines how stringent the warnings should be, based on analyses of fish caught in various waters. Dr. Nancy Kim of the health department said that the warnings had been stiffened after the Federal Government tightened its allowable limit for PCB presence in food, from five parts per million to two parts per million. The danger from PCBs and heavy metals is in continuing consumption, rather than in a single dose, and Dr. Kim notes, reasonably, that people are more likely to get a continuing supply of food from a store than from their own efforts on streams or lakes. The state can't effectively ban fish that don't meet the standard, so it tries to cut down on the number of times people eat such fish. How many anglers go along is impossible to say.</p>
        <p>It is not clear to every student of PCB toxicity that the new limit was needed. One serious doubter is Dr. Eric Berger, medical director of the American Council on Science and Health, who acknowledged that liver cancers appeared in laboratory rats that were fed very large doses of PCBs, but added:</p>
        <p>''We have not seen rigorous experimental verification that the danger of PCB-induced cancer is a significant human health problem, or that the change in the Federal standard will have any beneficial effect to justify the specific warnings about fish-eating.'' Other physicians argue that the warnings should be kept at their present levels unless they are proven overly strict.</p>
        <p>The state fisheries officials have no objection to emphasizing health department warnings in their own communications to anglers. Beyond their natural interest in the public health, their primary responsibility to anglers is to help them catch fish. If the catch is released unharmed because of the warnings, so much the better for the fishermen who come after them.</p>
