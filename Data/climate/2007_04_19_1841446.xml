        <p>While much of the region on Wednesday was cleaning up from the weekend's record-breaking storm, thousands of residents in towns along the Passaic River were forced from their homes by surging floodwaters.</p>
        <p>From Paterson, where 1,500 residents fled, to Little Falls, where more than 400 homes were damaged, the end of the rainfall brought no respite.</p>
        <p>The 80-mile river, which is considered one of the most flood-prone systems in the country, drains about 835 square miles of northern New Jersey and southern New York, according to the Passaic River Coalition, a preservation group. Because the Passaic drains so much water from such a large area, it takes longer for the river to crest downstream.</p>
        <p>By Wednesday morning, six of seven bridges spanning the Passaic River were closed, because either the bridges or the roads leading to them were impassable. In addition, several roads remained closed in Lodi, New Milford and Oradell.</p>
        <p>''Traffic was at bumper-to-bumper levels from 7 in the morning until noon,'' said Jos√© Torres, the mayor of Paterson.</p>
        <p>While residents fought the swollen river, Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey toured the saturated state by helicopter. About 5,000 people in 11 counties were forced to leave their homes in recent days, and at least three people were killed. Search teams retrieved the body of a woman yesterday who was believed to have accidentally driven into the Ramapo River on Sunday night, the police said. The woman, Mary Wagner, of Mahwah, had been reported missing since the night of the storm.</p>
        <p>Mr. Codey said the damage statewide would easily reach ''tens and tens and tens of millions of dollars.''</p>
        <p>''New Jersey clearly has received the brunt of this storm,'' he said. ''We were in the middle of the bull's-eye. It wasn't localized. It was all over the state. Whether you were up north or south or central, you got hit, and you got hit hard, and it just wouldn't let up.''</p>
        <p>In Bergen County alone, preliminary reports indicated that there was at least $300 million in damage, said Brian Hague, a spokesman for the county executive, Dennis McNerney.</p>
        <p>In his assessment, Mr. Codey was not telling merchants anything they did not already know. Many were pumping out basements and complaining about lost business and mounting expenses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Torres visited an emergency shelter at Passaic County Community College, where about 100 people had sought refuge overnight. A large gym was lined with cots, and donated clothing was distributed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Torres said that Mr. Codey and state police officials were sending additional rescuers to help those who had to flee their homes.</p>
        <p>The Passaic River crested at 11.88 feet near Paterson and Little Falls around midnight, said David A. Robinson, the state climatologist, and by 5:30 p.m. on Wednesday it had not dropped significantly.</p>
        <p>Dr. Robinson said the river was not expected to drop below flood stage until Saturday afternoon, making this the third-worst flood on record in Little Falls. The worst occurred in 1903, when the water reached 17.5 feet.</p>
        <p>Kirk R. Barrett, the director of the Passaic River Institute at Montclair State University, said a recent study of 18 flood gauges along the river showed an increase in 100-year storms at 8 gauges, and no decreases in the frequency of flooding. He said that overdevelopment, the loss of wetlands and climate change could well account for the phenomenon.</p>
        <p>At the community college shelter in Paterson, Jalissa Covington, 19, said she decided to flee her home on Governor Street around 6 p.m. on Tuesday, when the water was four feet deep.</p>
        <p>''All our stuff is damaged,'' she said, as she looked through donated clothes with her cousin, Sabrina Covington, 17. They had left home with just a few changes of clothes.</p>
        <p>In Little Falls, Joe Assaly said he had planned to stay home and ride out the storm. But early Wednesday, as water began rising in his driveway, he decided it was time to go.</p>
        <p>About 1 a.m., Mr. Assaly said, he waded through the knee-deep water that had accumulated on Parkway Avenue and spent the night in his car on a higher plot of land.</p>
        <p>''It takes a lot to scare me,'' Mr. Assaly said. ''But that rising water sure did.''</p>
        <p>By Wednesday afternoon, with more than four feet of water in his house and thousands of dollars in damage, he had made up his mind to move.</p>
        <p>''I love my house,'' Mr. Assaly said, ''but I don't ever want to deal with this again. Time to go someplace higher.''</p>
        <p>The situation was much the same in nearby West Paterson, where Michael Ibrahim stood in a parking lot looking at his submerged restaurant, the King of Shish Kabob on McBride Avenue.</p>
        <p>''Everything is gone, ruined,'' Mr. Ibrahim said. ''But, I am safe, my wife and daughter are safe, and we can replace what is lost. Money is money. It comes and goes.''</p>
        <p>He said he hoped to reopen, although he needed to assess the damage. ''With the power off, the food has certainly gone bad,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In Paterson, Morningstar Santana, who moved to New Jersey five months ago, stepped outside the community college shelter for a cigarette in the mid-afternoon, dressed in a robe and slippers. She had fled her rented home on Watson Street on Tuesday with few of her possessions.</p>
        <p>She said the Dunkin' Donuts where she works was also flooded.</p>
        <p>''It's not good,'' she said.</p>
