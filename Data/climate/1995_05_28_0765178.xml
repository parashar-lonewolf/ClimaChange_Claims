        <p>The great mythic symbol of scientific invention is the eccentric loner sweating away in a makeshift lab, chasing a vision. That does not even remotely describe John R. Novak. Mr. Novak is a smooth and polished 47-year-old salesman. He wears monogrammed shirts. He does not appear to sweat.</p>
        <p>That made him a target of colleagues when he had the presumption to claim a scientific epiphany: he said he thought that automobiles, the most prolific spewers of air pollution ever devised, could be transformed into mobile pollution sponges, sucking dirty, ozone-laden air into their radiators and cleaning it before expelling it.</p>
        <p>"There was an awful lot of skepticism," said Mr. Novak, the commercial director of automotive emissions systems at the Engelhard Corporation, based just north of Edison, N.J., where another famous inventor once lived and worked. "I mean, you know, here's a sales guy."</p>
        <p>The invention that resulted, which is now awaiting a patent -- and which Engelhard says may be included on some cars as early as the 1996 model -- is built around the kind of simple, profound observation that transforms whole ways of thinking and makes people smack the sides of their heads because they hadn't seen it themselves. Instead of focusing exclusively on reducing tailpipe emissions, why not enlist cars as active agents in the cleanup of existing pollution?</p>
        <p>"I've been in the field for 28 years, and this is a completely new way of thinking," said Dr. Haren S. Gandhi, the director of chemical engineering at the Ford Motor Company, which launched a joint venture with Engelhard this spring to develop applications of Mr. Novak's idea.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gandhi said that while much study was still needed -- and the vagaries of the market for any new product can never be fully guessed -- the design of the Engelhard ozone eater is extremely simple and the technology behind it has been around for years. "It's a new mindset," Dr. Gandhi said.</p>
        <p>The system, called Premair, cleans the air by a chemical reaction that destroys ozone (the main component of smog) and carbon monoxide. As air is drawn through a car radiator coated with the company's platinum-based catalyst, ozone molecules are broken down into oxygen and lethal carbon monoxide is converted into carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>The system would complement catalytic converters in automobiles, which destroy pollutants before they are released, and could add $500 to $1,000 to the price of a car, according to Engelhard.</p>
        <p>The development of Premair provides a glimpse into how corporate research has changed in recent years in the archipelago of industrial laboratories that ring the New York metropolitan region, from the telecommunications, chemical and pharmaceutical belt of central New Jersey through International Business Machines in the Hudson Valley of New York and into the defense and aerospace companies of Connecticut.</p>
        <p>The traditional world that existeduntil the last few years was hierarchical and structured, with walls separating company functions. The trend at newer, flatter, downsized corporations, research experts say, is to assemble teams of people with differing skills and perspectives, then to shake them up and see what happens.</p>
        <p>That a salesman like Mr. Novak would regularly brainstorm with Ph.D.'s in chemistry is testament to this new era, and perhaps to its fertility as well. New Jersey ranked fifth in the nation last year in patents awarded per million residents, according to the National Science Foundation. Connecticut was second. New York came in at 11th place. Delaware, home to Du Pont, came in first.</p>
        <p>"That's the way all companies are headed these days," said Charles F. Larson, the executive director at the Industrial Research Institute, a trade group. "The technical function is more closely linked with the manufacturing functions and the planning and marketing."</p>
        <p>Research scientists at Engelhard who made Mr. Novak's idea a reality said that because it was such a departure from previous approaches to exhaust emissions, it required not only technical development but a profound marketing change as well. This is a product that people were not clamoring for because it had not remotely occurred to them to need it.</p>
        <p>"Usually, you have a problem and we try and solve it," said Dr. Terence C. Poles, Engelhard's director of product development. "Here we had a solution, and we had to go out and find an application for it."</p>
        <p>And while the key inspiration was, by all accounts, Mr. Novak's -- a moment he cannot clearly remember, but which he readily concedes might well have occurred in a smoky bar under the influence of Jack Daniels -- there were some lesser flashes of insight along the way.</p>
        <p>Dr. Poles said he remembered vividly the rainy afternoon at the Redwood Cafe in San Rafael, Calif., during a business trip with some other executives, when a further startling realization emerged: pollution-sucking technology might actually be most efficiently employed on cars when they are parked and empty, or on the tops of buildings, for that matter.</p>
        <p>One Engelhard prototype, for example, features a solar-powered battery mounted on the car's roof -- it operates the radiator fan, which clicks on by thermostat at mid-afternoon when ground-level ozone is at its worst. Voila! The parking lot at the mall on a hazy August day suddenly justifies its existence.</p>
        <p>And how much credit to give the local culture? New Jersey, home to Edison and Einstein, is apparently the only state with its own cable television show offering tips for inventors. The program, produced by the New Jersey Institute of Technology, is called "New Jersey, the Invention State," and made its debut last week.</p>
        <p>Dr. John J. Steger, Engelhard's director of environmental catalyst research and development, gets his best ideas while doodling, going blank at his desk and closing his eyes, he said. He is credited with the realization that ozone can be broken back down into regular old oxygen at the colder temperatures of a radiator. That kept Mr. Novak's idea alive when hardly anyone else in the company thought it would work.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Steger said he was still mystified by the sources of true originality and inventiveness. He said he sometimes takes his lunch to the Thomas A. Edison Park Memorial Tower, a half mile from the lab, to ponder that very question and soak in the aura of the man credited with inventing the world's first industrial laboratory. But Edison lived in simpler times. However much of a wizard he was, he didn't have to deal with marketing consultants, or clean-air regulations. Collaboration is the name of the game today, Dr. Steger said.</p>
        <p>"There are all sorts of things you have to contend with that can't be held in one head," he said.</p>
