        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>We take issue with the suggestion by the economist Jagdish Bhagwati that ''linking human rights and the environment to trade is the lazy man's solution to extremely difficult problems and a recipe for failure all around'' (Economic Scene, Oct. 9).</p>
        <p>Presumably Mr. Bhagwati's non-lazy-person's solution, referred to in trade circles as the ''first best solution,'' is for developing countries to solve environmental problems using their own national environmental laws. These laws would address environmental problems by assuming the cost of environmental harm using the accepted ''polluter pays'' principle.</p>
        <p>While fine in theory, it doesn't work in practice. To assume the cost of environmental harm through national law, a country must enact the law, implement it through a competent environmental agency and have it enforced by an independent judiciary. Many developing countries lack this institutional capacity -- a stark fact that cannot be assumed away with an economic theory.</p>
