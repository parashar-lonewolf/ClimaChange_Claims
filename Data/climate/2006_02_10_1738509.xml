        <p>George C. Deutsch, the young NASA press aide who resigned on Tuesday amid claims that he had tried to keep the agency's top climate scientist from speaking publicly about global warming, defended himself publicly yesterday.</p>
        <p>Speaking to a Texas radio station and then to The New York Times, Mr. Deutsch said the scientist, James E. Hansen, exaggerated the threat of warming and tried to cast the Bush administration's response to it as inadequate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Deutsch also denied lying about having a college degree and trying to inject religion into some NASA Web presentations.</p>
        <p>''I have never been told to censor science, to squelch anything or to insert religion into any issue,'' he told the radio reporter, Brian Cain.</p>
        <p>Parts of that interview were posted on the Web site of WTAW-AM, in College Station (wtaw.com), where Mr. Deutsch attended Texas A&amp;M University until he joined President Bush's campaign in 2004.</p>
        <p>After seeing a transcript of some of the criticisms, Dr. Hansen said, ''This is so wacky that it deserves little response.''</p>
        <p>Starting in late January with several interviews in The New York Times, Dr. Hansen, the director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in Manhattan, and several career NASA public affairs officials and scientists complained about what they said were intensifying efforts by political appointees in NASA, including Mr. Deutsch, to control more closely his lectures and Web presentations.</p>
        <p>The Times reported on Wednesday that contrary to his résumé on file with NASA, Mr. Deutsch, who is 24, never graduated from Texas A&amp;M. Yesterday, in an interview with The Times, Mr. Deutsch said he had written the résumé in anticipation of graduating.</p>
        <p>''When I left college,'' he said, ''I did not properly update my résumé. As a result, it may appear misleading to some. However, I was up front with NASA about my undergraduate status when they hired me.''</p>
        <p>In an e-mail message, Mr. Deutsch said that remarks about religious views on the creation of the universe sent last October to a Web designer working on a presentation on Albert Einstein were ''personal observations'' and never were reflected in the material that was posted online.</p>
