        <p>LEAD:</p>
        <p>Harlin the Active</p>
        <p>Harlin the Active</p>
        <p>Just who is Renny Harlin and why does he seem to be almost everywhere this summer?</p>
        <p>Well first of all, Mr. Harlin seems to be almost everywhere because he has two high-profile movies in the theaters. One is ''Die Hard 2,'' the well-received thriller starring Bruce Willis as an off-duty police officer whose idea of killing time while waiting for his wife's flight to arrive at Dulles International Airport near Washington is to kill a few score terrorists. The other is ''The Adventures of Ford Fairlane,'' the comedy starring the not-always-well-received Andrew Dice Clay as a private eye specializing in the music trade.</p>
        <p>So Mr. Harlin, who first made a splash in Hollywood by directing ''Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,'' the highest-grossing of the sometimes gross Freddy Krueger horror films, is nothing if not a man of parts.</p>
        <p>But why shouldn't Mr. Harlin be talented and versatile? After all, he has been making movies for some 20 years - in other words, since he was 10 or 11 years old.</p>
        <p>''Since the time I was 5 I wanted to see every movie there was,'' the 31-year-old Mr. Harlin said the other day from his Los Angeles office as he recalled his childhood in Helsinki as the son of a doctor and a nurse. ''They were very against me getting into any strange creative area of life.''</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, he continued: ''Instead of going to medical school I went to film school and started my own film company in Finland, making short films and documentaries. I wanted to make features, but in Finland feature production is financed by the Government. I wrote 12 feature-length scripts, and I didn't get any financing from the Government.</p>
        <p>''So I just decided to go to Hollywood. I wrote a script in English and came here five and a half years ago and couldn't get any financing for it. Then I went back to Finland and sold my production company and my home, and with this money I was able to finance 20 minutes of that movie.</p>
        <p>''I shot 20 minutes and came back with a videotape of that 20 minutes, and I spent five months in Hollywood and was totally broke, and then finally I found a company called Cinema Group, and they decided to finance the rest of this movie.''</p>
        <p>It was ''Born American,'' filmed at a cost of $1.1 million, Mr. Harlin said of the adventure story that starred Mike Norris and involved some young Americans on vacation in Finland who stray across the Russian border and fight it out with Soviet forces.</p>
        <p>''And that sort of worked as my calling card here,'' Mr. Harlin said. ''Born American'' in 1986 led to ''Prison'' in 1988, and along the way, Mr. Harlin met the producer Joel Silver. ''He's always looking for new talent, and I guess he takes pride in finding new talent.'' Mr. Silver chose Mr. Harlin to direct ''Ford Fairlane,'' and the director said he was still filming it about a year ago, when Mr. Silver gave him the script for what was to become ''Die Hard 2.''</p>
        <p>''I said, 'That's a really good script,' '' Mr. Harlin recalled. ''I said, 'Who's doing it?' '' 'You,' he said. '' 'When, next year?</p>
        <p>'' 'No, next week.'</p>
        <p>''And that,'' said Mr. Harlin, ''is how I got involved.''</p>
        <p>''What I've been trying to avoid is being typecast. I was really lucky I was able to do different kinds of movies, and I hope to do that in the future.''</p>
        <p>Coming up next, he went on, is a movie written by Joe Eszterhas, (''Jagged Edge,'' ''Music Box,'' among others) whose latest script just brought $3 million at auction. The one Mr. Harlin plans to film has the working title ''Gale Force.'' ''It is a very erotic, very suspenseful thriller in the style of 'Key Largo,' '' Mr. Harlin said. ''It takes place in Florida during a hurricane.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Harlin plans to begin filming ''Gale Force'' in the autumn, but before that, he is taking on the role of producer for ''Rambling Rose,'' written by Calder Willingham and to be directed by Martha Coolidge, with Laura Dern as the star. ''It's a little drama that takes place in 1935 in the South,'' Mr. Harlin said.</p>
        <p>Explaining his decision to produce, he said: ''I read so many good stories and good books that I feel I can't possibly make all of them as a director. So I felt as a producer I could get more stories made into movies and then direct the ones I passionately want to direct.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Harlin said: ''Right now by making these commercial movies, I have reached a point where I can choose what I make. Now I feel a great responsibility that I have to use my talent in a way that is meaningful, that is going to do some good in the world.</p>
        <p>''My pet project is one I'm going to direct after 'Gale Force.' It is about protecting the environment: everything from the ozone layer to dolphins and whales and everything in between.''</p>
        <p>New Operator</p>
        <p>The Loews Theaters Corporation will become the operator of the Paris and Festival theaters in midtown Manhattan by the beginning of September under an arrangement with the theater's landlord, Sheldon Solow, it was announced yesterday by Robert Smerling, president of the corporation.</p>
        <p>Loews Theaters is a subsidiary of Columbia Pictures Entertainment, which operates some 850 theaters in the Northeast.</p>
        <p>'We're going to play art and specialty films, both domestic and foreign,'' Mr. Smerling said. He added, ''Our intention is to maintain the individuality of those two theaters.''</p>
