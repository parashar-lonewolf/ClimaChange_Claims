        <p>I'M SCANNING THE FASHION MAGAZINES, waiting for Michiko to cut my hair, and I gradually become aware of an eco-phobic theme threading through the beauty ads. A shampoo promises to "discourage environmental damage." A lotion calls itself "environmental skin care." One message begins ominously, "Until the world is a safer place for your hair."</p>
        <p>It occurs to me that in order to succeed, the people who make and market cosmetics must be poets for our time. After all, what is more intimate than ointments we rub onto our skin, gels we squeeze into our bath? If we're going to let a lotion into our bathroom, it must speak to our deepest longings and fears. Its advertising, packaging, its very consistency, must follow the path of the Zeitgeist.</p>

        <p>I'M SCANNING THE FASHION MAGAZINES, waiting for Michiko to cut my hair, and I gradually become aware of an eco-phobic theme threading through the beauty ads. A shampoo promises to "discourage environmental damage." A lotion calls itself "environmental skin care." One message begins ominously, "Until the world is a safer place for your hair."</p>
        <p>It occurs to me that in order to succeed, the people who make and market cosmetics must be poets for our time. After all, what is more intimate than ointments we rub onto our skin, gels we squeeze into our bath? If we're going to let a lotion into our bathroom, it must speak to our deepest longings and fears. Its advertising, packaging, its very consistency, must follow the path of the Zeitgeist.</p>
        <p>Lulled by the sound of the hair dryers, I fall into a reverie, remembering how my mother used to send us out to play in the sun and fresh air -- an innocent time when the sun was considered good for us, before chlorofluorocarbons depleted the ozone layer, allowing dangerous UV rays to penetrate the atmosphere, turning sunshine from a blessing into a curse.</p>
        <p>And sun is only the most obvious peril, I think, as I step out of the hair salon and into a weird blue haze drifting up from Third Avenue in Manhattan. What's in that cloud? Asbestos? Sulfuric acid? I know it's eating the obelisk in Central Park. What's it doing to my skin and hair?</p>
        <p>On a slow browse through the great cosmetics bazaar of my favorite department store, I sample seductively packaged nostrums that offer protection not only from sun but also from invisible pathogens lurking in the corrupted atmosphere.</p>
        <p>At the Prescriptives counter, there's Line Preventor 3 Environmental Skincare, which has a sun screen as well as vitamins C and E, and BHT -- free-radical scavengers that combine with unstable oxygen molecules and render them harmless. It also contains something called "carnosine," which protects against cigarette smoke. You can use it before going into a bar, like donning an anti-contamination suit before entering a radioactive zone.</p>
        <p>Estee Lauder offers Advanced Night Repair Protective Recovery Complex. The heavy, amber, beveled-glass bottle with dropper brings back comforting medicinal memories. The sleek gold cap reminds me of the preciousness of the substance within. Just four or five drops on face and throat, and I'll sleep easier at night knowing I've done all I can to recover from the assaults of the day.</p>
        <p>Alert now to the eco-theme, I see that purveyors of cosmetics are addressing not only our fears of a toxic environment but also our hunger for substances we used to take for granted, such as pure water and air.</p>
        <p>"It's mostly water" used to be a derogatory expression. Who would have guessed that a whole line of beauty and bath products -- called H2 O Plus -- would emerge, boasting water as the main ingredient? With names like Ebb Tide, Sea Spray and Natural Spring, the bath and shower gels sold at the brightly lighted H2 O Plus store on Madison Avenue promise to restore ordinary tap stuff to its primal state. For a parched face there's Hydraspa Moisture Mist, a slightly viscous clear liquid that delivers water as well as vitamins E and B, aloe, cucumber, chamomile, sea kelp and the sensation of walking through heavy fog on a deserted Nantucket beach.</p>
        <p>And how about air? We used to take it for granted. Oxygen was some colorless gas that floated around. We knew we needed it to live, but it was always there. Now we worry about all sorts of noxious gasses coming between us and our oxygen.</p>
        <p>Lancaster, sensing our concern, has come up with a lotion to revive suffocating faces: Skin Therapy Vital Oxygen Supply. It is packaged in a cobalt blue bottle (polyurethane but reminiscent of what Proust might have had at his bedside) and, according to its promotional material, will deliver "pure molecular oxygen" to the cells, increasing the skin's oxygen content by 100 percent after 14 days.</p>
        <p>I've ridden in enough elevators with overdoused women to think of perfume as the very antithesis of fresh air. But some of the new fragrances -- New West Skinscent for Her, Escape, Sunflowers and L'Eau d'Issey among them -- are formulated to smell, paradoxically, like the absence of smell, like the pure, clean scent of sun-dried wash on the line or a mountain campsite after a storm.</p>
        <p>It's not just water and air. With meadows giving way to shopping malls, we feel a hunger deep as DNA for herbs and grasses, roots and barks. The high priests of the cosmetics world, sensing this need, have responded with a blooming profusion of creams and lotions, unguents and potions, based on plants.</p>
        <p>"Natural" cosmetics isn't a new idea, I remind myself as I turn into the Body Shop on upper Broadway and spread some Blue Corn Moisture Cream on my hands. The Body Shop, like the Whole Earth Catalogue, is a child of the 70's. It still has a 70's look, with its bright mirrors and Pop Art colors, and a 70's crusading spirit (no to animal testing and petrochemicals; yes to products from the rain forest, plant-based cosmetics, recycled packaging and returning bottles for refills).</p>
        <p>As we approach the millennium, there's been a resurgence of interest in eco-aware cosmetics but with a subtle shift in emphasis. Formerly we were concerned about what cosmetics and its packaging were doing to the environment. Now we worry more about what the environment is doing to us. Typifying the change is a new shampoo offered by Aveda, a company that has been manufacturing products based on nonpolluting plant essences since 1978. Aveda's Hair Detoxifier is a "clarifier" made from a "plant derived purifier" that rids the scalp of petrochemically based styling gels and sprays. Aveda recommends a once-a-week purge. Presumably the detoxed client will go right out again and release petrochemical hair products into the waste system, but she will have banished them, at least temporarily, from her own.</p>
        <p>Origins is a line of plant-based cosmetics that Estee Lauder introduced in 1990. To truly understand eco-cosmetics in the 90's, I entice my husband to go on a pilgrimage with me to the Origins Store in SoHo. Here we're greeted with a smell that somehow combines eucalyptus with apple pie. Olfactory memories of childhood and nature converge. Soap that looks like it's been cooked in vats by a coven of New Age nuns is sold in chunks wrapped in brown corrugated paper with snippets of dried herb tucked into straw ties. Stone floors and white maple shelves make us think of a Finnish cabin in the woods. Miniature peach baskets (the kind you hardly see anymore) are stacked at the door, inviting us to forage. The husband chooses Secret Pleasures Massaging Oil, a massage brush, and Peace of Mind, a peppermint lotion to rub onto the temples.</p>
        <p>Origins has followed the ecology-based formula of the Body Shop, but it has definitely caught the spirit of the times. If the Body Shop is a crusade, Origins is a haven, a retreat, a place where we can feel good about eco-correctness and console ourselves with barely remembered scents of straw drying in the sun, forests soaking in the rain. On the way out, I marvel at how the dreamers and seekers toiling in the great hive of the beauty industry have brought forth in material form both our fear of contaminated nature and our yearning after what's been lost.</p>
