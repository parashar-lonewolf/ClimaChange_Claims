        <p>DURING George E. Pataki's three terms as governor, the amount of land managed by the state increased by 66,000 acres. At the same time, about 250 positions were cut from the parks department and capital improvements languished.</p>
        <p>How to manage more land with fewer people epitomizes the challenges facing Carol Ash, the new commissioner of the State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, as she begins her tenure under Gov. Eliot Spitzer.</p>
        <p>''When we did get the extra land for the parks department, it was terrific because we got an extra 26 parks,'' she said. ''The downside is there isn't much infrastructure.''</p>
        <p>Two of those parks are in Westchester County: Donald J. Trump and Rockwood Hall State Parks. They are basically open land, a total of 555 acres, with limited accessibility. Although no plans have been created, at least some development, like parking lots and trails, will be necessary to make them available to the public.</p>
        <p>But beyond development issues, Ms. Ash faces a long list of problems that need to be addressed within the existing system, many of which were documented in a 2006 report by Parks and Trails New York, an organization that advocates protecting parkland throughout the state.</p>
        <p>The cost of the capital improvements outlined in the Parks and Trails report are estimated at $300 million to $500 million and range from drinking-water issues to dam safety.</p>
        <p>''That's what we're beginning to tackle right now,'' Ms. Ash said, referring to the improvements discussed in the report.</p>
        <p>In Westchester alone, more than $1 million is needed for bathhouse rehabilitation and water system replacement at Franklin D. Roosevelt State Park. At the Old Croton Aqueduct, the Ossining Bridge needs $1 million worth of work.</p>
        <p>''We feel like the park system is fraying at the edges,'' said Robin Dropkin, the executive director of Parks and Trails. But she expressed confidence that Ms. Ash could help turn the system around.</p>
        <p>''In the job she just came from, she had to deal with two different state governments, plus a very active friends group,'' Ms. Dropkin said. ''She also has a real passion for the issues, which for us is wonderful.''</p>
        <p>Before becoming commissioner, Ms. Ash, who is 62, spent seven years as the executive director of the Palisades Interstate Park Commission, which manages more than 100,000 acres in New York and New Jersey. She was instrumental in promoting passage of the Highlands Conservation Act in 2004, the federal legislation designed to help conserve the 3.2 million acres of forest and open space that cut through Connecticut, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>As head of the parks department, a job that pays $127,000 a year, Ms. Ash is assessing what needs to be done and adding staff members to help shore up the system. Through the department's $280 million operating budget for 2007, she will add 52 staff members, 10 to 12 of whom will be tradespeople like stonemasons, electricians and plumbers.</p>
        <p>With a capital budget of $30 million, she will be examining new ways of paying for projects, from seeking grants to private partnership deals to sponsorship arrangements. She is also pushing for changes to the state's bottle bill that would expand deposits to include containers from noncarbonated beverages, like water and sport drinks, while channeling unclaimed deposit money to an environmental protection fund that could be used to remediate issues in state parks.</p>
        <p>Before joining the Palisades commission, Ms. Ash was the state director of the Nature Conservancy, an organization dedicated to land and species preservation around the world.</p>
        <p>In her new job, Ms Ash said she remains committed to the creation of open spaces that preserve natural species and foster an environment that will combat global warming.</p>
        <p>''We have been losing open space at a huge clip,'' she said. ''It's important to make sure land is protected and take care of what we have.''</p>
