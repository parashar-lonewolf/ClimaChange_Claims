        <p>THE steamroller has stalled.</p>
        <p>The Senate is about to pass a bill the president does not like, written by a senator he does not like: John McCain's campaign finance legislation. The president's tax bill has run into a Democratic counter-proposal and resistance to his own claim that tax cuts in future years would cure an economic slowdown this year. Congress may reject the president's plan to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve, he conceded Thursday. His faith-based charity initiative is encountering doubts from some churches. European nations are angry at the president's dismissal of the Kyoto treaty on global warming.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, national polls, while showing approval of President Bush's job performance at nearly 60 percent, also showed public disapproval creeping up from the 20's to the 30's.</p>
        <p>None of this is fatal, of course. Presidents don't have to be invincible to succeed, and usually aren't. About this time eight years ago President Clinton's economic stimulus plan was being battered; a few months later his budget passed. Besides, Mr. Bush will probably get a tax bill enough to his liking to crow over. And if the president signs a campaign finance bill, it might be painful for him, but it will be popular. Further, his public standing is still pretty strong.</p>
        <p>In any case, few imagined the Bush juggernaut of the first weeks would last, not with a 50-50 Senate, which depends for its nominal Republican control on the longevity of 98-year-old Strom Thurmond. Still, Mr. Bush's new difficulties accompany a growing understanding that this is a very conservative administration.</p>
        <p>The dawning of that perception has its comic moments, as when abortion rights advocates, environmentalists, even labor, take turns in proclaiming, like Captain Renault in Casablanca, that they are ''shocked, shocked to find that there is conservatism going on in here.''</p>
        <p>It is true that Mr. Bush ran on a platform that was a litany of conservative principles, from school vouchers to protecting ''the life of the unborn.'' But he also insisted that he was a ''compassionate conservative,'' who would reach across the party aisle. On the stump, voters heard a great deal about moderation and bipartisanship, very little about red-meat conservative issues.  Again, when the Supreme Court effectively ended the election, Mr. Bush said in his Dec. 13 speech to the nation, ''Whether you voted for me or not, I will do my best to serve your interests, and I will work to earn your respect.''</p>
        <p>Coming from someone known for good manners and not for divisive name calling in the style of Newt Gingrich, that certainly sounded to many like a promise that he would work carefully to build consensus. But instead Mr. Bush's approach has been to avoid anything that might seem tentative, and to seize as his mandate not the popular vote but the oath of office.</p>
        <p>Those who had been lulled into the expectation of a centrist administration had, arguably, only themselves to blame, having ignored several clear indications of Mr. Bush's real thinking.</p>
        <p>First, there was his record in Texas, where labor, the environment and health care received little attention. Second, there was the fact that conservative political groups remained solidly behind him, whatever genial message he offered. And finally, those professing dismay today might have at least remembered their own campaign ads from last fall, which portrayed Mr. Bush as an enemy of the working family and the environment.</p>
        <p>IN fact, there was enough wish-fulfillment in the left's view of Mr. Bush that it's hard to disagree with Anne Coulter, a conservative writer, who said last month that Mr. Bush had shown ''how easy it is to hornswoggle liberals.''</p>
        <p>''All you have to do is go around calling yourself nice,'' she said. ''He just treats liberals like small children having nightmares. Darn if it didn't work.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush himself could have been making a similar point March 24 when he joked at the annual Gridiron dinner in Washington that Democratic power-broker Robert S. Strauss had told him ''You can fool some of the people all of the time, and those are the ones you have to concentrate on.''</p>
        <p>Now that the scales are falling from the eyes of the innocent, the obvious question is whether the growing view of Mr. Bush as very conservative will hurt him -- and if so, how much. Obviously his managers saw that image as a negative during the campaign; otherwise they would have embraced it. It is still a problem, since the American voter generally feels more comfortable with politicians near the middle of the road, not the shoulder. But how much it may hurt is likely to depend on the economy.</p>
        <p>''A level of strong conservatism in his policy preferences will not work substantially against him if we're in the middle of a substantially robust economy,'' said Norman J. Ornstein, a political scientist at the American Enterprise Institute. But if the slowdown continues ''then any flaw works against him.''</p>
        <p>Possibly the most dangerous of those flaws emerged in an ABC News/Washington Post Poll released last week: It found that 61 percent of the public thought Mr. Bush cared more about ''protecting the interests of large corporations'' than about those of ''ordinary working people.'' Only 31 percent thought he cared more about workers.</p>
        <p>Even without a deep recession, continued Republican control of Congress is uncertain.</p>
        <p>The House, where the 10-vote G.O.P. majority had held so far, is inherently unstable. And in the Senate, 20 Republican seats (including Mr. Thurmond's) are up for election in 2002, compared to only 13 for the Democrats.</p>
        <p>Republicans believe that having control of the White House, Senate and House for the first time in half a century will work in their favor. But, as one senior House Democratic aide said: ''They run the whole show. Just as we lived and died with Clinton for eight years, they live and die with Bush. If Bush is for anti-environmental things, then House Republicans are. The president becomes the face of your party.''</p>
        <p>Maybe. But one tactic that served him well with the Texas legislature is also at work in Washington. This administration is not pushing a lot of bills as its own. It's a kind of stealth politics. Anti-abortion forces, for example, want a bill that would apply federal murder statutes to fetuses. No one doubts that Mr. Bush would sign the bill, but it is up to the Congressional backers and the National Right to Life Committee to get it passed, and to take all the political heat.</p>
        <p>MANY of Mr. Bush's most criticized and most conservative actions have been taken by executive order. Indeed, of all his decisions, the most politically damaging may be the one to reverse a Clinton administration rule reducing the amount arsenic allowed in drinking water. This, far more than changing the rules about carbon dioxide in the air or ergonomic standards in the workplace, is something everyone can understand. Arsenic is a poison, and it's easy to make a campaign ad that serves, as Stan Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, put it, as ''an exclamation point for a cascade of decisions.''</p>
        <p>In the Senate, Mr. Bush has a different problem. There, he can either stand on principle and sometimes lose, or he can craft compromises, as he often, and adroitly, did with the Texas legislature.</p>
        <p>Thus far, the administration has sent mixed signals. On his education plan, the administration has already hinted that it won't insist on vouchers. On taxes, however, Mr. Bush he repeatedly said that $1.6 billion in cuts over 10 years is ''just right.''</p>
        <p>Even if Mr. Bush reveals himself to be a political realist, happy to take a half-loaf over the next three years, it is unlikely this White House will face widespread disaffection from true believers on the right. David Keene, head of the American Conservative Union, said the once-impatient conservative movement had matured. The style and genuine conservatism of this administration may have spurred that change.</p>
        <p>In the administration of President Bush's father, Mr. Keene said, ''Conservatives were treated as if they were in the stands,'' like home team fans expected to cheer. Now he said, through appointments and consultations, ''Conservatives are part of the team. If you're part of the team you tolerate mistakes or failures more than you do as a fan.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  April 8, 2001, Sunday  An article last Sunday about political opposition to the Bush administration misspelled the first name of one of the president's supporters, a conservative writer. She is Ann Coulter, not Anne.</p>
