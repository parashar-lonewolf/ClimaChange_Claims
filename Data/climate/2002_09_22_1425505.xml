        <p>The United States energy secretary told his counterparts from other countries today that current high oil prices and volatility in the market could harm global economic growth.</p>
        <p>''High prices could produce an undesirable ripple effect on the economies of the world,'' the American secretary, Spencer Abraham, said in an address to the opening session of the International Energy Forum, a gathering of ministers from 65 countries. ''If the industrialized world experiences an economic slump, its markets for the developing world's products will contract, damaging developing economies.''</p>
        <p>His comments came after the decision on Thursday by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to leave its production quotas intact but to promise to pump additional oil if shortages develop, including one stemming from an attack on Iraq. OPEC's decision could lead to tight supplies and higher prices globally because oil importers will likely have to use their inventories to meet demand during the winter months.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Abraham said, ''High prices may be pleasing to producers in the short term, but in the long term, volatile pricing regimes of this kind are destabilizing and harmful to all participants.''</p>
        <p>As energy ministers spoke at the forum, the meeting's sponsor, the International Energy Agency, released a study saying that the global economy will become even more dependent on oil from the Middle East over the next three decades. The study said such continued reliance would further heighten concerns about the security of energy supplies and the ability of major nations to reduce greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>In its biannual world energy outlook, the agency also said it expects oil prices to average $21 a barrel through the end of the decade -- down from nearly $30 now -- despite renewed prospects for a global economic expansion and political uncertainty in the Middle East. Cheap and abundant oil from the Middle East will be coupled by a decline in the use of coal and nuclear power, except in Asia, where China and India will increase mining, it said.</p>
        <p>Gyrations in price resulting from political instability in the Middle East will remain, the agency said, because oil and other fossil fuels will meet more than 90 percent of the world's new energy needs. Almost all additional oil needs will be met by producers in the region as well as Russia. Developing countries, particularly China, will consume about two-thirds of the new oil supply, the report said.</p>
        <p>''Security of supply has come back to the top of the agenda and likely will remain there,'' Robert Priddle, the agency's executive director, said.</p>
        <p>Reliance on Middle East oil will be heightened because the growth of supplies in North America and Europe is likely to slow in the coming years, the agency said. At the same time, it said, most industrialized countries will funnel proportionately less money into developing nuclear energy as they retire existing facilities. They will also scale back the use of coal as they try to meet emissions targets in the Kyoto protocol on global warming.</p>
        <p>The forecast highlights some of the differences between the agency and OPEC. Representing large oil-consuming nations, the agency, based in Paris, tends to push for greater production and lower prices.</p>
        <p>By contrast, OPEC prefers to make cautious forecasts for oil demand fearing that prices could plummet if it pumps more oil and demand does not rise fast enough to meet it.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Rilwanu Lukman, the president of OPEC and Nigeria's top oil official, described talk of oil shortages as ''scare mongering.''</p>
        <p>Regardless, the global economy is likely to remain hostage to volatile oil markets, the energy agency said. ''Unless surplus capacity in current oil production and refining increases, markets will remain sensitive to actual or feared swings or disruptions in supply, whether political or technical,'' its report said.</p>
