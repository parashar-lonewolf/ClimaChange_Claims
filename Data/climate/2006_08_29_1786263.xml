        <p>Bill Clinton worked the crowd of AIDS survivors, clasping the outstretched hands of children alive because of the AIDS medicines his foundation donated.</p>
        <p>Inside the rural hospital here that he recently helped renovate, where Rwandans were hunted down and killed during the genocide he regrets he didn't try to stop as president, Mr. Clinton heard people once skeletal from AIDS tell of their resurrections to robust health.</p>
        <p>Since he left office more than five years ago at age 54, one of the youngest former presidents ever, Mr. Clinton has made a lasting mark in a cause that he came to only late in his presidency: fighting the AIDS pandemic across Africa and the world.</p>
        <p>Few public figures in America have spawned as much speculation about what motivates them as Mr. Clinton. Abroad, even fewer inspire the affectionate reception Mr. Clinton received as he raced across seven African countries in eight days in July. Crowds at roadsides and in hospitals wanted to touch him -- and he obliged by shaking hands, kissing babies and hugging people with AIDS.</p>
        <p>Here on Mr. Clinton's fourth visit to Rwanda, it was clear the efforts by his foundation had personal meaning. He said he was sorry his administration failed to intervene during the 1994 genocide. ''The United States just blew it in Rwanda,'' he said flatly. Paul Kagame, Rwanda's president, said he had accepted Mr. Clinton's repeated apologies.</p>
        <p>But on this trip, Mr. Clinton seemed anything but a man tormented by guilt. Rather, he reveled in his role as a private citizen championing people with AIDS.</p>
        <p>''The reason I do this work I do is that I really care about politics and people and public policy,'' he said in one of several interviews, scornfully dismissing questions about whether his global AIDS work is a form of redemption for what he failed to accomplish on the issue as president, or for the Monica Lewinsky scandal. ''I'm 60 years old now, and I'm not running for anything, so I don't have to be polite anymore,'' he said. ''I think it's all a bunch of hokum,'' he added, calling such speculation psychobabble.</p>
        <p>''I have never met anybody who spent all their time talking about everybody's motives who at the end of their life could talk about very many lives they had saved,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton was adamant that he had done all he could about global AIDS with a Congress hostile to foreign aid, though he conceded that his administration fought too long to protect the patent rights of pharmaceutical companies against countries trying to make or import cheaper AIDS medicines.</p>
        <p>'Everyone Was Worried'</p>
        <p>After he left office, Mr. Clinton faced some skepticism as he took up the cause of people with AIDS dying faraway deaths in poor countries. His administration, which sought more resources to combat AIDS domestically, had a far weaker claim to leadership on AIDS worldwide.</p>
        <p>When doctors specializing in public health met him at the William J. Clinton Foundation in Harlem in the fall of 2002, Howard Hiatt, the former dean of the Harvard School of Public Health, bluntly asked Mr. Clinton why those present should expect that ''you'll be able to accomplish now what you didn't undertake in your presidency -- an attack on this plague?''</p>
        <p>''Everyone was worried,'' said Richard Marlink, who headed Harvard's AIDS Institute. ''Is this a campaign with photo ops and press releases or a long-term commitment?''</p>
        <p>In the years since, doctors at the forefront of AIDS treatment have worked with Mr. Clinton. Dr. Marlink volunteered to help Mr. Clinton's foundation in South Africa. Dr. Hiatt, who serves on the board of Partners in Health, a nonprofit group that works with Mr. Clinton in Rwanda, said the former president ''has really perceived the seriousness of the problem.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton and his foundation have undertaken projects with two dozen developing countries, raising money to post nurses in rural clinics in Kenya, mustering experts to train hospital managers in Ethiopia and buying drugs for thousands of sick children, among other things.</p>
        <p>His foundation also has negotiated steep cuts in the price of AIDS medicines through deals with drug companies that cover more than 400,000 patients in dozens of countries, helping propel momentum for treatment of the destitute.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bernard Pécoul, who led a campaign for access to medicines for Doctors Without Borders from 1998 to 2003, credited Mr. Clinton and his foundation for showing independence from the politically powerful drug industry and helping to accelerate the decline in prices for generic AIDS medicines in developing countries.</p>
        <p>''They have been very clever in supporting generic policy in the United States, a country where it's not easy,'' he said. ''And sometimes they've been even more courageous than the United Nations system, which is under pressure from member states.''</p>
        <p>The Clinton foundation's budget last year was $30 million, raised from private donors. Mr. Clinton, who oversees its operations full time, has plunged into many causes, from childhood obesity to tsunami relief to global warming, but he has made his most substantive contribution on AIDS.</p>
        <p>He said Rwanda was one of the first countries he chose to work in because ''they had a really good chance to dig out of the hole and I wanted to help them do it.''</p>
        <p>For years, he tried to coax Dr. Paul Farmer, known for his work caring for the poor in remote, rural Haiti, to recreate his model of AIDS treatment in Africa, the heart of the epidemic.</p>
        <p>Last year, Dr. Farmer and the group he co-founded, Partners in Health, arrived in Rwinkwavu. With support from the Clinton Foundation and others, he has transformed a dilapidated facility that lacked even a doctor into a thriving rural hospital.</p>
        <p>More than 1,500 people have been put on AIDS medicines here. Reproducing the pioneering model used in Haiti, Dr. Farmer has community workers, many of them peasants, deliver antiretroviral medicines to people with AIDS every day, minimizing reliance on scarce doctors and nurses.</p>
        <p>Like most international leaders and American advocates for people with AIDS in the 1990's, critics say, Mr. Clinton's efforts on global AIDS did not match the epic scale of the human tragedy as it unfolded across Africa and millions died and were orphaned.</p>
        <p>In recent years, the fight against AIDS has leapt onto the world stage, claimed by Mr. Clinton and his Republican successor, George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>There is a measure of irony in this. Since 2003, Mr. Bush has marshaled billions of dollars in American assistance for a global assault on the disease, financing lifesaving treatment for hundreds of thousands of people with AIDS. Yet because of his foreign policies, notably the war in Iraq, he is often met by protests when he travels abroad, while Mr. Clinton is warmly embraced across the developing world.</p>
        <p>''George Bush has actually delivered more resources, but Clinton is ten times more popular in Africa,'' said Princeton Lyman, who was American ambassador to South Africa under Mr. Clinton. ''That's because, just like he does everywhere, he portrays that sense that he cares.''</p>
        <p>On his recent tour of Africa -- his fifth since 2001 -- Mr. Clinton showed a remarkable ability to establish a human connection with people he met.</p>
        <p>In Johannesburg, Mr. Clinton and a frail Nelson Mandela, about to turn 88, clutched each other's hands like a long-lost son and his beloved father.</p>
        <p>En route to the airport in Lilongwe, Malawi, where crowds of people strained to catch a glimpse of him, Mr. Clinton suddenly halted the motorcade, conducted an impromptu interview in the middle of the road, then plunged into a throng of young men reaching out to touch him.</p>
        <p>At a hospital in Mafeteng, Lesotho, Mr. Clinton strolled into a sunny courtyard with 6-year-old Arriet Moeketsi, a little girl in a polka-dot dress. Arriet, who takes AIDS medicines donated by Mr. Clinton's foundation, trustingly leaned her face against the former president and never let go of his hands during a prolonged news conference.</p>
        <p>Bill and Melinda Gates, the billionaire philanthropists, watched. Mr. Clinton had visited an AIDS project of theirs in Durban, South Africa, and they had come to Lesotho to see his work. When Mr. Clinton left the hospital with Arriet, a Clinton volunteer asked the Gateses to stay back so photographers could follow him.</p>
        <p>The world's wealthiest couple seemed to take no offense. The two Bills, as they have been dubbed, have taken to doing high-profile AIDS advocacy events together, with Mr. Clinton bringing star power and Mr. Gates his deep pockets.</p>
        <p>''He plays a unique role in shining a light on the problem,'' said Mr. Gates, after he made it into the courtyard.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has come a long way on global AIDS. For most of his presidency, his trade office fought to protect the patent rights of pharmaceutical companies against attempts by developing countries to make or import cheaper generic medicines. ''I think it was wrong,'' he now says of that approach.</p>
        <p>During the first six years of his presidency, federal spending to fight AIDS worldwide stagnated at paltry levels, never topping $141 million.</p>
        <p>But by his last budget, spending more than tripled to $540 million, but Mr. Clinton says that was far from enough. Even so, he contends that no one could have done better.</p>
        <p>The Role of Congress</p>
        <p>The Democrats controlled Congress for only his first two years in office, he pointed out, when ''everybody's obsession'' was the AIDS problem in America. After that, the Republican-dominated Congress that later supported Mr. Bush's $15 billion, five-year global AIDS plan fiercely resisted spending on foreign assistance.</p>
        <p>''Have you forgotten what I had in the Congress?'' he asked. ''That the Republican Congress spent all their time trying to trash me?</p>
        <p>''And the only reason they gave money to George Bush for AIDS is they wanted to have something they looked progressive on since they were cutting taxes for rich people like me,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Michael Gerson, who was a senior adviser to Mr. Bush on global health issues, noted that the Republican Congress was, in fact, open to persuasion that global AIDS was a spending priority. But he also said the issue had ripened by the time Mr. Bush was president. The price of antiretroviral drugs fell after Mr. Clinton left office, helping change the view that it was too costly and difficult to treat people in poor countries.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gerson also said of the Clinton record: ''I don't believe they were visionary or pushed the system. I don't think they were thinking big.''</p>
        <p>The debate over whether Mr. Clinton missed a political opportunity to lead the charge on global AIDS years before Mr. Bush seized it is far from over.</p>
        <p>Greg Behrman, the author of ''The Invisible People: How the U.S. Has Slept Through the Global AIDS Pandemic, the Greatest Humanitarian Catastrophe of Our Time,'' offers a split verdict.</p>
        <p>''There are two acts here,'' he said. ''Clinton's post-presidential leadership has been extraordinary. As president, though, the record is clear. Clinton was not a leader on global AIDS and the consequences have been devastating.''</p>
        <p>After he left office, Mr. Clinton considered his future with a keen eye on history, analyzing what former presidents had done.</p>
        <p>He concluded that another former Southern governor, Jimmy Carter, a Nobel Peace Prize winner who is now recognized for his work on human rights, democracy and neglected diseases, was ''the only person who'd done anything that remotely resembled what I thought I could do.''</p>
        <p>From the start, Mr. Clinton had a host of issues on his agenda, but quickly found himself drawn into AIDS. He turned to his old friend Ira Magaziner, a fellow Rhodes scholar and corporate consultant who had managed the Clintons' failed health care reform effort. Mr. Magaziner has since led the foundation's AIDS program.</p>
        <p>The two men discovered in 2002 that the Bahamas was paying $3,500 per person a year for generic AIDS drugs. ''I said, 'Ira, please find out why in the hell these people are paying $3,500 for $500 drugs,' '' Mr. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>They learned the Bahamas was buying through middlemen, so the foundation helped the country purchase directly from Cipla, the Indian generic-drug manufacturer. ''So our first victory was a lay-down,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''All of a sudden, they could treat six times as many people for the same amount of money.''</p>
        <p>Opportunities proliferated, and Mr. Clinton's enthusiasm grew.</p>
        <p>His name opened doors with generic drug makers. With growing demand for AIDS drugs already on the horizon, as well as the economies of scale that come with that, Mr. Magaziner took a team of volunteer consultants to India in 2003 to negotiate for lower prices. Companies opened their books.</p>
        <p>''The name Clinton in India holds more charisma and credibility than any other American name,'' said Dr. Yusuf K. Hamied, Cipla's chairman.</p>
        <p>Through cost cutting, spurred by breakthrough talks with companies that supplied ingredients to the drug makers, the team got deals. Cipla, for example, halved the price of the most common AIDS triple-drug therapy, already declining due to competition, to $140 a person per year.</p>
        <p>Similarly, Mr. Clinton was able to use his relationships with political leaders, like President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, who had questioned whether H.I.V. caused AIDS. The country had not begun treating its people for the disease, though almost five million had been infected. ''He was getting killed in the global press about it,'' Mr. Clinton recalled.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, who knew him from his own time as president, met with Mr. Mbeki in 2003 as one politician to another. ''I said, 'You know, I really want to help you, and as you know, I may be the only one of those involved in this work who's never been publicly critical of you,' '' Mr. Clinton said he told Mr. Mbeki. '' 'But this is something you have to do.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mbeki soon invited Mr. Clinton's foundation to help the country write a comprehensive treatment plan. South Africa now has more than 130,000 people on antiretroviral drugs, still far short of what critics say is needed.</p>
        <p>Since 2004, Mr. Clinton has campaigned to raise the profile of children with AIDS. A scant 20,000 children in the developing world were then getting drug treatment, while more than 500,000 a year were dying. The Clinton foundation has raised $4.4 million to buy drugs for 13,000 children, train health workers, renovate pediatric wings and pay for lab tests.</p>
        <p>''Children are alive in numbers we couldn't have imagined a couple of years ago because of what he's done,'' said Peter McDermott, chief of H.I.V. and AIDS programs at Unicef.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's ambitions seem to grow daily, and his foundation is now branching out in Africa from AIDS into poverty. As he relaxed one recent evening in a sumptuous, $2,260-a-night suite in Johannesburg, with zebra skin rugs underfoot (the lodgings provided to him gratis by a rich South African businessman who owned the hotel), he got excited just thinking about fertilizer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Magaziner has people riding trains and trucks that carry fertilizer to figure out why a commodity that should enable farmers to grow more food and avoid hunger costs so much in Africa.</p>
        <p>''You follow the trail!'' Mr. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton was joined on his trip by Sir Tom Hunter, a Scottish entrepreneur who has promised to spend $100 million of his fortune in collaboration with the foundation, much of it on economic development.</p>
        <p>''Tom, where's Tom?'' Mr. Clinton called out excitedly as he chatted with representatives of a nonprofit group that promotes solar-powered lights during an event here in Rwinkwavu.</p>
        <p>What if Rwanda could manufacture such lights locally? Mr. Clinton mused. Why not electrify villages so children can study at night? ''It might be possible to get a factory here that would serve all of central Africa!''</p>
