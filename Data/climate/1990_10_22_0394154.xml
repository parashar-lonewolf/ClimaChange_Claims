        <p>International A3-11</p>
        <p>Panama is offering stiff resistance to American law-enforcement efforts to crack the shell of secrecy, and presumed illegality, surrounding the nation's multibillion-dollar international banking trade. Page A1</p>
        <p>News analysis: El Salvador could see its hard-liners of the left and right fortified by the U.S. decision to cut military aid in half. But in the long term, the move may push the army to compromise in a peace settlement with the rebels. A8</p>
        <p>Peru detains about 8,000 after guerrilla bombings A3</p>
        <p>A Palestinian killed a soldier, a gardener and a policeman, as he rampaged through a tranquil Jewish neighborhood, wielding a 15-inch knife. Police said he was seeking revenge for the killings at Al Aksa Mosque. A1 Gunmen killed a Lebanese leader who was the head of one of the nation's Christian clans and a close associate of General Michel Aoun. The killing raised concern that a new round of violence might erupt.  A3</p>
        <p>The residency rights of Yemenis in Saudi Arabia have been suspended by the Saudi Government in response to Yemen's support of Iraq, and a mass migration of at least 350,000 of them has taken place. A10 Heath says Iraq agrees to release some Britons A10</p>
        <p>Soldiers at the fabled Fulda Gap, a former border area separating East and West Germany, say the cold war's end has been very disorienting as they've had to adjust to seeing former enemies walk among them. A1</p>
        <p>Kohl plan breathes life into monetary union D8</p>
        <p>The Soviet economic transition to a market economy remains unruly and chaotic, no matter how neat the logic of an economic program. A tale about a Government plan to raise meat prices exemplifies the situation. A6</p>
        <p>Under Prague revolution, princely family is restored A6</p>
        <p>Pakistan's coming election is very close, according to experts, who say that several difficult-to-measure variables could swing the vote to Benazir Bhutto or her military-backed opponents. A11</p>
        <p>Lantau Journal: A Buddha statue, the largest one of bronze in the world, has been built by a group of Hong Kong monks seeking to promote Buddhism even as Communist China sets to take over the territory in 1997. A4</p>
        <p>Malaysian Prime Minister wins by margin he sought A8</p>
        <p>Tokyo, mad at U.S. rebuke, says furor over slur seems racist A5  National A12-17, 20, B7</p>
        <p>Budget talks were broken off by top White House officials, who stormed out of the Capitol and accused Democrats of being unwilling to negotiate a "fair" tax compromise. A1</p>
        <p>Special breaks for certain companies and industries fortunate enough to be represented by the handful of lawmakers negotiating the final compromises are buried in the deficit reduction plans. A16</p>
        <p>While Congress trims budget, it enlarges some programs A16</p>
        <p>State tax issues form a maze of political complications that may even be more confusing than Washington's quagmire. The message that politicians are hearing in the fall campaigns is subtle, mixed and difficult for government to cope with. A1</p>
        <p>News analysis: White House turmoil brought on by the Civil Rights Act of 1990 reflects a deep division among senior officials who are also struggling with a combative Democratic majority in Congress and angry Republican lawmakers. A15</p>
        <p>Rights leaders reject Bush proposal A15</p>
        <p>An accord on acid rain was reached by House and Senate negotiators. The rules, which tighten limits on certain smokestack emissions, are designed to enable lakes, streams and forests polluted by the corrosive rain to repair themselves naturally. A1</p>
        <p>Tobacco industry urges E.P.A. to reject scientist for panel A14</p>
        <p>Most of the traditional Mafia clans, battered by aggressive investigators and weakened by inept leadership and changing times, appear to be fading out of existence, law-enforcement officials and independent experts say.  A1</p>
        <p>The trial of the 2 Live Crew may have had the makings of a clash of cultures, but the jurors instead found artistic merit in the music -- so much that they began trying lyrics of their own. A12</p>
        <p>Bangor journal: Hunting states take a look within A12</p>
        <p>Regional B1-6</p>
        <p>The Love Canal disaster is the focus of a $250 million trial beginning on Wednesday, in which New York State will try to prove that Hooker Chemical knew the risks when it dumped 21,800 tons of hazardous chemicals into the canal. B1</p>
        <p>New York candidates for governor agree that the state needs to wean itself from new taxes and tighten its belt. Yet they disagree over how to cut back, and differ over whether further tax increases should be avoided at all costs. B1</p>
        <p>Norwood is shrouded in fear after three killings in the North Bronx community in a six-week period. Residents have responded by curtailing their stoop and street life, as well as by forming a citizens' patrol.  B1 A study of urban high schools identified features that successful ones have in common, and recommended that those qualities be the core of reform efforts around the country. B1</p>
        <p>A 13-year-old girl, who had recently talked of wanting a child of her own, disappeared late Saturday with an infant boy who lived in a Bronx foster home with her. But both were found unharmed early this morning, the police said. B1</p>

        <p>Sports of the Times: Lou Piniella, the manager whom George Steinbrenner dismissed twice, had much to savor on Saturday night. His Reds swept the Athletics, even as Mr. Steinbrenner appeared as a guest host on "Saturday Night Live." A1</p>
