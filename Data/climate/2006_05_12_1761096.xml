        <p>An environmental effort to protect the earth's ozone layer could mean disruptions for the nation's millions of asthma patients.</p>
        <p>A federally mandated shift to a more ozone-friendly version of the hand-held inhalers used to quell asthma attacks is creating spot shortages of the devices, because production of the older versions has declined even before producers of the new inhalers ramp up fully. The shift is also giving a few drug makers the rare chance to introduce brand-name medicine into a market long dominated by low-cost generics.</p>
        <p>The drug at issue is albuterol, the leading prescription treatment used to open constricted airways during an asthma attack. Because the new inhalers are covered by patents, they are commanding high prices -- $30 to $60 each, including the drug inside, compared with as little as $5 to $25 for the older generic versions.</p>
        <p>By the end of 2008, which is the federal deadline for phasing out albuterol inhalers that use an ozone-depleting propellant gas, the nation's annual cost for these inhalers could be $1 billion higher than now. The main beneficiaries would be Schering-Plough, GlaxoSmithKline and other drug makers whose asthma inhalers are protected by patents that in some cases extend to 2017.</p>
        <p>For people with drug insurance, price increases may be less a concern than occasional spot shortages of the devices. In early March the Food and Drug Administration issued an alert about temporary shortages, although an agency official said more recently that supplies appeared to be ''certainly adequate or nearly adequate.''</p>
        <p>But some patients like Ross Berry have occasionally had to scrounge. ''At Target here you couldn't get it for weeks,'' said Mr. Berry, 42, a disabled veteran in Reston, Va., who is covered by health insurance. ''Safeway didn't have it. Finally I found a Giant that had it. It got a little bit scary.''</p>
        <p>For people with no insurance, high prices might be the big concern. Although asthma can affect people from all economic strata, it is a disease disproportionately found among low-income people. Federal officials estimate that the new policy could mean an additional $95 a year for each of the 1.25 million asthma patients without health insurance.</p>
        <p>On the playground of an elementary school in a Hispanic neighborhood of Los Angeles recently, mothers brought their children for checkups at the Breathmobile, a free clinic on wheels. None of the women were yet aware of the inhaler transition, but when told that prices of the devices might double, some immediately recognized it as a potential burden.</p>
        <p>''I guess we have to do our best to buy it even if we have to pay cash,'' said Jenny Diaz, a nurse's assistant. She said she had been paying about $20 each for inhalers for her 9-year-old son and her husband because, while she is covered by the state's Medicaid program, she has a high deductible. She said her husband, a pizza deliveryman, needed a new inhaler every two to three months and her son less frequently.</p>
        <p>About 6.4 percent of children with family income below the poverty level had at least one asthma attack a year, compared with 5.4 percent of all children, according to a federal survey a few years ago. Asthma prevalence is particularly high among blacks. Experts say this could be because people with lower incomes might be exposed to dirtier air and to agents like dust mites and cockroaches that could set off asthma attacks.</p>
        <p>The devices at issue let patients dispense a mist of albuterol to open constricted airways during an attack. A single inhaler generally provides 200 puffs of medicine, and people may use anywhere from 1 to 12 a year, according to doctors. In most cases consumers buy a new inhaler each time, rather than buying a drug refill for an existing inhaler.</p>
        <p>The products being phased out use chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's, to propel a mist of medicine. CFC use is being ended in accordance with the Montreal Protocol, a 1987 global treaty intended to save the stratosphere's ozone layer, which protects the earth from some of the sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays.</p>
        <p>CFC has already been phased out of heavy-use applications like refrigeration and air-conditioning. Inhalers, which once accounted for less than 1 percent of CFC use, are now the major remaining application. But with alternatives available, the F.D.A. decided last year that the CFC inhalers were no longer essential and outlawed their sale after Dec. 31, 2008.</p>
        <p>Schering-Plough and GlaxoSmithKline, which had developed the new type of inhalers and were keen to sell more of them, urged the F.D.A. to set the deadline at the end of 2005. But the F.D.A. chose the later date to ensure that there would be an adequate supply of inhalers using the new propellant, called hydrofluoroalkane, or HFA, before the older devices were outlawed.</p>
        <p>The agency did express concern about the impact on the uninsured, saying that higher prices might have some adverse effects on public health by deterring use of albuterol. But the agency said it could not quantify that effect.</p>
        <p>There was little resistance to the change when the F.D.A. held a public advisory committee meeting on the issue in 2004. GlaxoSmithKline and Schering-Plough said then that their patient-assistance programs for low-income people would help provide the drug to those who could not afford it. Glaxo also promised to provide two million free samples a year, something it says it still intended to do after the CFC inhalers were gone.</p>
        <p>Asthma patient groups generally supported a more rapid changeover to help the environment. So did some medical societies, which saw the transition as an opportunity to reduce use of albuterol, which merely quells an asthma attack, in favor of drugs like inhaled steroids that can prevent attacks in the first place.</p>
        <p>''In many ways, treating asthma as a rescue situation is dangerous and is sort of putting a Band-Aid on the situation,'' said Dr. Julian L. Allen, chief of pulmonary medicine at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>Debra Mendelsohn of Claremont, Calif., who has two asthmatic children, said she favored protecting the ozone layer. Ms. Mendelsohn, who described herself as belonging to the upper-middle class, said the transition would perhaps mean a few extra dollars a month in insurance co-payments.</p>
        <p>''For me that's a small price to pay for a clean environment and for clear lungs,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Berry, the asthma patient in Virginia, said that the small amount of CFC used by inhalers meant the changeover was ''just straining at gnats and, in so doing, is causing a tremendous burden on people.''</p>
        <p>The prime reason for the shortage during the transition is that Ivax, which supplied about 30 percent of the generic CFC inhalers, has cut back production. The company says it will no longer sell the product after July 1, because the European Union will not allow it to obtain more CFC for its factory in Ireland, where the inhalers are made.</p>
        <p>''We will simply run out of gas, quite literally,'' said George Barrett, the head of North American operations for Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, which recently acquired Ivax.</p>
        <p>Makers of the HFA inhalers, which so far represent only a few percentage points of the market, have been hesitant to increase production. The makers fear they will not be able to sell the new products because generics will remain available for three more years.</p>
        <p>Schering-Plough is the largest supplier of generic CFC inhalers, which it sells under the Warrick brand. It is also poised to be the major supplier of the new HFA inhalers, which it sells under the Proventil name; they are manufactured by 3M.</p>
        <p>Julie Lux, a spokeswoman, said Schering-Plough was producing CFC inhalers at maximum capacity while 3M was increasing output of HFA inhalers. Last November, to prevent hoarding, the company began allocating generic inhalers to wholesalers.</p>
        <p>GlaxoSmithKline, which stopped making a CFC product a few years ago, voluntarily suspended production of its Ventolin-HFA devices last May to refine its manufacturing process and to add a dose counter to the inhalers, a spokeswoman said. Shipments are expected to resume in mid-June.</p>
        <p>Armstrong Pharmaceuticals, which is the No. 3 supplier of generic inhalers after Warrick and Ivax, said it had excess capacity and would increase production. Armstrong is a unit of Amphastar Pharmaceuticals.</p>
        <p>Some health care providers are taking steps to cope with a shortage, or an anticipated one. Kaiser Permanente, the big health maintenance organization, said it was providing only one inhaler at a time to each patient.</p>
        <p>The supply pressures have resulted in some price increases even for the older inhalers, although they remain far cheaper than the newer ones. The Web retailer Drugstore.com recently raised its price for orders of three or more generic inhalers to $8.99 a device from $6.66.</p>
        <p>With more than $1 billion a year in potential extra revenue at stake, inhaler makers might seem to have an incentive in calling attention to a shortage to speed the transition.</p>
        <p>Sepracor, for example, said in an earnings conference call with analysts in late April that the shortage of CFC's provided a big opportunity for its asthma drug, Xopenex.</p>
        <p>The company says that Xopenex, available in an HFA inhaler since December, is an improved, safer version of albuterol -- although The Medical Letter, published by a nonprofit organization that reviews clinical data, recently concluded ''there is no convincing evidence'' that Xopenex ''offers any advantage'' over albuterol.</p>
        <p>Xopenex is even more expensive than the new albuterol inhalers. A single Xopenex device sells for about $49 on Drugstore.com, compared with about $39 for an HFA albuterol inhaler.</p>
        <p>The Zeno Group, a public relations firm hired by Sepracor, has been trying to get reporters to write about the inhaler supply situation, offering to set up interviews with doctors and patient groups. It distributed a news release from the Allergy and Asthma Network Mothers of Asthmatics, a patient group, urging people with asthma to consider switching to HFA inhalers now, to avoid being caught short as the supply of CFC devices diminishes. The press release mentioned Xopenex as the newest HFA inhaler on the market, though it also mentioned other brands.</p>
        <p>Nancy Sander, an asthma patient who also has children with the condition, is founder and president of the nonprofit mothers group. She said that she wrote the press release herself and that Zeno helped distribute it only because her group did not have the money to do it alone.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sander has reported owning $25,000 to $50,000 of Sepracor stock in her retirement account. But she said that did not influence her belief that asthma patients should start trying to find the best new alternative that works for them. ''For patients to make the transition now is incredibly important,'' she said.</p>
