        <p>Ice caps are melting. Oceans are rising. Villages are disappearing. Wild animals are not quite sure what is going on.</p>
        <p>Pretty funny stuff, eh?</p>
        <p>Well, on Thursday night it was, as a parade of comedians and a few serious actors joined forces here at Caesars Palace for two and a half hours of environmental consciousness-raising in a live show called ''Earth to America,'' focused on global warming. It was taped for repackaging and a two-hour nationwide broadcast at 8 p.m. Sunday on the cable channel TBS.</p>
        <p>Climate change never had so many famous friends, and whether they were dancing (Jason Alexander), cavorting inside a giant earth (Jeffrey Tambor), strumming a banjo (Steve Martin) or simply doing stand-up (Larry David, Ben Stiller, Cedric the Entertainer and others), the presentation posed two questions critical to the future of the country:</p>
        <p>One, should average citizens do more to harness activities that leading scientists say contribute to climate change? And, two, do comedy and global warming really mix?</p>
        <p>The answers appeared to be: yes and for the most part.</p>
        <p>Laurie David, the executive producer and wife of a certain ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' star, is making it her life's work to draw attention to the growing risks of the earth warming through unchecked emissions of carbon dioxide. She flips the finger at people driving gas guzzlers. She holds seminars and fund-raisers in her home. She sponsors a Web-based ''virtual march'' on Washington (www.stopglobalwarming.org) that has drawn more than 150,000 participants. She arranged with Fox News to present a serious hourlong show on global warming earlier this week.</p>
        <p>''Earth to America'' was her crowning achievement, discounting a coming appearance on an afternoon soap opera, ''The Bold and the Beautiful.'' She plays a character who talks about you know what.</p>
        <p>''Look, I don't have the millions of dollars that Exxon has,'' she said Thursday as rehearsals here were winding down. ''But I've got comedy. I've got satire. I've got stars. We all have to try everything we can. I come out of the comedy business, so I use every relationship I have if that's what it takes. I called in all my favors for this.''</p>
        <p>It was quite a lineup, and volunteers like Dustin Hoffman and Leonardo DiCaprio, who teamed for a decidedly noncomedic paean to the planet, soft music and all, worked for the union minimum as all their colleagues did.</p>
        <p>Some of the comics made only passing reference to global warming. While Ray Romano talked a lot about prostitutes, he did take note of the extraordinary blanket of neon along the Las Vegas Strip and wondered why the hotel Circus Circus needed a redundant name. He also vowed to hire ''a hybrid hooker.''</p>
        <p>The Too Warm Trio -- Mr. Martin on banjo and Tom Hanks and Eric Idle on guitars -- sang a Pythonesque song about earth science, leaving Mr. Martin with little more than a single amusing line, ''Global warming, are we for it or against it?''</p>
        <p>And Mr. David, who opened the show with a taped appearance as Paul Revere riding a horse onto the strip, screeching, ''Global warming is coming,'' mixed up his chemicals in the show's best stand-up routine as he explained how he changed from ''a lifetime of indifference to nature'' to a ''full-fledged committed activist.''</p>
        <p>''One word,'' he said. ''Tuna. It has mercury in it. It's not safe to eat it anymore.''</p>
        <p>Nevermind that mercury has nothing to do with global warming.</p>
        <p>''I've been ordering tuna every day of my life since I was 10 years old,'' he said. ''I was a tuna connoisseur. I appeal to all of you people to start solving this problem so I can once again sit in a restaurant and order a tuna sandwich, with lettuce and tomato. Hold the mayo.''</p>
        <p>But other comedians stayed on point -- and correctly so. Cedric the Entertainer was the only performer actually to explain what global warming is: ''It's like a big bag of microwaved popcorn. Eventually, we're all going to start popping.''</p>
        <p>Given the comedic disposition of some of her guests, like Bill Maher and Al Franken, Ms. David said she urged all the performers to keep politics to a minimum, especially with the way Hollywood celebrities are often viewed by Republicans as a tool of the liberal establishment.</p>
        <p>Perhaps mindful of an unintended boost that Michael Moore's antiwar documentary, ''Fahrenheit 911,'' might have provided Republicans in the 2004 election, she said it was important to portray global warming as a moral problem, not a political one.</p>
        <p>Most performers complied. Robert Smigel, an actor and writer whose hand operates a cigar-chomping puppet known as Triumph the Insult Comic Dog, even gave Republicans a chance to present any opposing views to environmentalists who are demanding immediate government action.</p>
        <p>He somehow convinced four Republican House members -- Jack Kingston of Georgia, Dan Lungren of California, Tom Feeney of Florida and Lee Terry of Nebraska -- to sit for a taped interview with Triumph. As the puppet riddled them with snarky one-liners, they held to their talking points, insisting that market forces should determine policy on global warming, not special interests.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smigel, a former writer for ''Saturday Night Live,'' said later that he was proud that a television audience will have a chance to see congressmen ''engage a dog in a meaningful debate.''</p>
        <p>Alas, some comedians could not control themselves, finding President Bush an inviting target even though he conceded this year for the first time that he was convinced humans were contributing to global warming.</p>
        <p>But what do you expect when you invite Wanda Sykes, Mr. Franken and especially Mr. Maher to the party? Their stand-up routines were typically acerbic and not nearly so kind to Mr. Bush as Will Ferrell's taped impersonation, which had fewer sharp edges.</p>
        <p>Discussing the issue of ''so-called global warmings,'' Mr. Ferrell as the president recalled how climate change might have been at work as long ago as biblical times.</p>
        <p>''It was hot back then, too,'' he said with a twang. ''That's why Adam and Eve were naked.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Franken said later that skewering Mr. Bush might not have been so risky as Ms. David feared. ''In the last Wall Street Journal poll, his approval rating was 34 percent,'' he said. ''So, no, I don't think it's so bad.''</p>
        <p>An hour after the show, Ms. David was a beaming center of attention at a cast party where celebrities and television executives offered hearty congratulations.</p>
        <p>For the most part, she said, she was delighted with the effort, although she expressed slight annoyance that some performers pushed the envelope. But that's what editing rooms are for.</p>
        <p>''In a show like this, with a live audience of 4,000, we have to give them a little more,'' she said Friday morning. ''Normally, I would not have had so many stand-ups. But we always knew we had to get it down to two hours for the television show.''</p>
        <p>This being Las Vegas, here's a safe bet: Mr. David is in, Mr. Maher is out.</p>
