        <p>As President Bush began his second trip to Europe since taking office, a partisan battle erupted at home over the direction of his foreign policy -- and the propriety of criticizing a president while he is overseas.</p>
        <p>Tom Daschle, the Senate majority leader and a Democrat from South Dakota, started the furor by delivering a wide-ranging critique of Mr. Bush's foreign policy in a question-and-answer session with Gannett newspapers on Wednesday. In his remarks, published in USA Today, Mr. Daschle said Mr. Bush's policies were driving a wedge between the United States and its allies as well as eroding America's leadership position in international affairs. ''I think we are isolating ourselves and in so isolating ourselves, I think we are minimizing ourselves,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daschle said that the Bush administration had pulled back from an aggressive posture as a Middle East peace broker, was not taking a lead role in helping to check the spread of the AIDS virus in Africa and was damaging relations with Russia and European allies through its pursuit of an antiballistic missile system.</p>
        <p>And he noted that the British prime minister, Tony Blair, had offered to act as an intermediary for the United States in dealing with European allies. ''Since when did we need a liaison with Europe?'' Mr. Daschle asked. ''What a commentary.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Daschle's remarks set off a firestorm of criticism from Republicans. Mr. Bush, who was in London, dismissed the charges of isolationism and defended his positions on missile defense and global warming. ''I do believe it's important to have a bipartisan spirit when it comes to foreign policy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Bush's national security adviser, telephoned Mr. Daschle Wednesday afternoon. They had what Mr. Daschle called ''a very candid conversation,'' though he declined to characterize it further.</p>
        <p>Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, was even more forceful. ''This is a real violation of a longstanding tradition of bipartisanship on foreign policy,'' he said. ''It is unseemly, unwise and inaccurate.''</p>
        <p>Republicans also leveled their own charges of isolationism as they noted that in recent years Democrats have led the opposition to expanded trade.</p>
        <p>Senator Trent Lott, the minority leader from Mississippi, said of Mr. Daschle's remarks, ''That is the kind of thing that happens when you still have on your training wheels.''</p>
        <p>Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, an Illinois Republican said: ''I think Tom Daschle is wrong. America is not becoming more isolationist. Nor does the world take us less seriously.'' Senator Bill Frist, a Tennessee Republican close to Mr. Bush, called Mr. Daschle's comments ''clearly political, not patriotic.''</p>
        <p>Even the Republican National Committee weighed in. Gov. Jim Gilmore of Virginia, the Republican chairman, called on Mr. Daschle to issue an immediate apology, and said, ''His breach of longstanding bipartisan cooperation in matters of foreign policy is offensive to our men and women in uniform and our country.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Daschle, at one of his frequent Senate news conferences, stood by his criticisms of the president's policy today but said he should have been more attuned to the timing. He said that he had spoken in the course of a wide-ranging interview crossing many topics.</p>
        <p>''I was being open and honest yesterday about my feelings,'' he said. ''And you know, had I given some thought to the fact that the president was departing, I probably would have chosen a different time to make those comments. But having said that, I certainly will not back away from those comments.''</p>
        <p>He noted that Republicans had often criticized President Clinton while he was abroad, and later Mr. Daschle's aides released a list of examples. These included Representative Tom DeLay, a Texas Republican, saying in 1998: ''I'm suggesting that the president of the United States cannot be believed. And I think it's reflective in his foreign policy.''</p>
        <p>Former Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia said in August 1998 of a trip by President Clinton to Russia, ''These are two weak presidents trying to hold each other up.'' And during an American air assault on Iraq on the eve of Mr. Clinton's impeachment, Mr. Lott said, ''I cannot support this action in the Persian Gulf at this time.''</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Daschle said: ''I did think it's unfortunate that on so many occasions during the Clinton administration, Republicans were extraordinarily critical and damaging to the President's efforts when he attempted a number of foreign policy initiatives. I don't want to take that approach.''</p>
