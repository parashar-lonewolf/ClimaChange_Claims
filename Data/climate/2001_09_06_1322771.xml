        <p>David Crosby, the mustachioed, silver-haired third of Crosby, by Stills &amp; Nash, claims not to think when he plays. ''Gets in the way,'' he said.</p>
        <p>So on a cool night at the PNC Bank Arts Center here recently, he said he was on autopilot of sorts, tapping into something visceral, when he stepped up to the microphone after the trio's third song, ''Déjà Vu,'' and urged audience members to sign a petition at intermission against the Bush administration's energy policy.</p>
        <p>''You'll find that most of us, most musicians, are very vocally opposed to not just what's laughably called an energy policy,'' Mr. Crosby said later, ''but to this administration's complete disregard for the planet.''</p>
        <p>Riled by an energy plan they call a sop to business and a grave threat to the environment, Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash and about a dozen other popular bands joined together over the summer to stir their fans to action, as Congress prepares to consider significant energy legislation this autumn.</p>
        <p>Part of an effort, organized by the drummer Michael Diamond, or Mike D., the founder of the Beastie Boys, with the help of several major environmental groups, performers as disparate in style and following as Jackson Browne, Moby, Matchbox 20 and the Barenaked Ladies have permitted volunteers to canvass their concerts for signatures against the energy plan. Most, like Mr. Crosby, have urged fans to sign petitions at the stadiums or online.</p>
        <p>More than 30,000 signatures have been sent to Congress as a result of such efforts, said Stuart Trevelyan, a spokesman for Save Our Environment, the coalition of environmental organizations working with the musicians. Mr. Diamond, the singer Alanis Morissette and the Dave Matthews Band are sending e-mails to fans asking them to log their protests with the Senate via electronic postcards on saveourenvironment .org. The Dave Matthews Band alone has a 400,000-member e-mail list it plans to tap, Mr. Trevelyan said.</p>
        <p>Built on the assertion that the United States is suffering its worst energy crisis since the 1973 Arab oil embargo, the White House energy plan includes a range of measures that administration officials say balances environmental protection with the production of fuel supplies while also bolstering economic growth. The administration has taken some steps on its own, but it is up to Congress to introduce legislation that fleshes out a national energy policy. Environmentalists were rankled recently by a House energy bill that they said gave more than $30 billion in tax incentives to energy companies while calling for drilling in protected federal lands.</p>
        <p>It remains to be seen whether the celebrities' campaign influences the energy plan, especially the aspects that most worry its  critics, like opening more federal lands to oil and gas exploration. But so far, environmentalists are pleased to have such marquee names on their side.</p>
        <p>''We're about to have critical votes in the Senate,'' said Gene Karpinski, executive director of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, an advocacy organization. ''And we need as many voices as possible speaking about the plan and reaching out to different people, and that's what these artists are doing.''</p>
        <p>Activism among musicians is hardly new. But if musicians 15 years ago rallied fans around heart-rending causes like famine in Africa, they have recently embraced more complex approaches to political and economic issues. Bono, the lead singer of U2, has joined advocates and economists to lobby industrialized countries to forgive the foreign debt of developing nations. The Beastie Boys, Moby and others regularly organize and play at benefits to aid Tibet. Sting and the Grateful Dead guitarist Bob Weir have performed to raise money to protect rain forests in the Amazon.</p>
        <p>Fighting a Republican administration on the environment at a Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash concert may seem like preaching to the choir, but as latecomers rushed to their seats in the PNC Bank Arts Center, most merely smiled at the Sierra Club's request for their signatures and then strode on. Still, the canvassers expected to get 500 to 600 signatures from the 17,000 people attending the concert that evening.</p>
        <p>People stopped every few minutes to sign, despite the fact that the concert had already begun. ''He's given away $33 billion in tax credits to big oil,'' a Sierra Club volunteer, Steve Ember, told Eileen Ford, 48, as she signed the petition and her husband, Kevin, waited his turn.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford, who said he worked in management, needed no argument. ''The fact that we rejected the Kyoto protocols was extremely shortsighted,'' he said, referring to the international treaty on reducing emissions linked to global warming.</p>
        <p>Mr. Diamond seemed to reach the same conclusion as he read about the details of the Bush energy plan when it was published in May. In a telephone interview from New York, he said he was particularly concerned about President Bush's proposal to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil drilling as a response to the electricity crisis in California. ''If you think about it for more than a minute,'' Mr. Diamond said, ''you realize that a pipeline that starts in Alaska is not going to get here for another 5 or 10 years.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Diamond contacted Adam Werbach, a former president of the Sierra Club, who, in turn, introduced him to the Save Our Environment coalition. Mr. Diamond cast around to other artists and said that because of their own concerns, they were easily convinced of the need to unite against the energy policy.</p>
        <p>On the Internet, Mr. Diamond calls on fans to act: ''Dear peoples, though I rarely do stuff like this, pestering the masses, this is a topic that is too vital, too central and too important to our entire planet to ignore,'' his online letter says. ''I'm asking for your help to stop George W. Bush's energy plan.''</p>
        <p>In legislation backed by the White House that is thick with arcane tax and economic-incentive schemes, drilling in the Arctic  refuge in Alaska has become the most accessible symbol used by environmentalists  to convey the clash between their priorities and those of the Bush energy plan. The message seems to have taken hold.</p>
        <p>Taking a pen held out at the New Jersey concert, 21-year-old Joshua Storch signed the petition and said, ''I know all about Alaska and I'm totally opposed to drilling there.''</p>
        <p>In late July, when Ms. Morissette performed in Alaska, she spoke out against drilling in the refuge. Midway through her set at the Egan Center in downtown Anchorage, she urged the crowd to get involved in oil development issues and to sign the petition circulating in the lobby. But in oil-friendly Alaska, the pitch drew a mixed response of cheers, polite applause and a smattering of boos.</p>
        <p>''This is the state that oil built,'' said Patrick Gillan, 32, who refused to sign the petition. Mr. Gillan pointed out the importance of oil in the state's economy: ''Most Alaskans are pretty honest with themselves -- We need oil, and we need ANWR,'' he said, referring to the wildlife refuge by its acronym.</p>
        <p>Ms. Morissette tuned in to the debate over the refuge in June, after Mr. Diamond contacted her about the energy plan. She began researching the issue and digging into the environmental movement, reading ''The Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight,'' a book by Thom Hartmann about the environment and spirituality.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Werbach, the former Sierra Club president, also contacted Ms. Morissette about fighting development of the refuge. Her role, Ms. Morissette said, is as publicist, not policy expert. ''By taking part in it myself, I hope I encourage people to do the same.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Morissette's message resonated with many in the Anchorage audience, including those who had worked in the North Slope oil fields. Those circulating petitions said they gathered about 300 signatures, or roughly 70 percent of those they approached.</p>
        <p>''One place in Alaska, one place on earth, should be left alone,'' said Rodney Jones, 46, as he signed. Mr. Jones said he had worked in the oil fields of Alaska in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>Amy Lynnbille, 26, said that she had relatives who worked in the oil patch but that she opposed refuge development. ''When have we done enough?''</p>
