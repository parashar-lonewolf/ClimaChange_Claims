        <p>Editorial Notebook by Verlyn Klinkenborg on timeliness of new book, Mosquito, by Dr Andrew Spielman and Michael D'Antonio, arriving just when fears of West Nile virus, various forms of encephalitis and other mosquito-borne diseases are at their peak</p>

        <p>Personification is something most entomologists try to live without. It sets unintended metaphors rolling, like boulders in an avalanche. Picturing insects with human traits creates unwanted, almost invisible implications and muddies the guarded language of science. But it's always interesting, if completely unscientific, to turn personification inside out, to wonder how we might appear to the other creatures of creation. A new book -- ''Mosquito,'' by Dr. Andrew Spielman and Michael D'Antonio -- suggests some of the ways a mosquito might read the human race.</p>
        <p>A purist would argue that we don't appear at all to mosquitoes, except as a warm vessel of protein or a carbon dioxide plume. But if they could imagine us, mosquitoes might conclude, like bad Aristotelians, that the human race was made to serve it.</p>

        <p>Personification is something most entomologists try to live without. It sets unintended metaphors rolling, like boulders in an avalanche. Picturing insects with human traits creates unwanted, almost invisible implications and muddies the guarded language of science. But it's always interesting, if completely unscientific, to turn personification inside out, to wonder how we might appear to the other creatures of creation. A new book -- ''Mosquito,'' by Dr. Andrew Spielman and Michael D'Antonio -- suggests some of the ways a mosquito might read the human race.</p>
        <p>A purist would argue that we don't appear at all to mosquitoes, except as a warm vessel of protein or a carbon dioxide plume. But if they could imagine us, mosquitoes might conclude, like bad Aristotelians, that the human race was made to serve it.</p>
        <p>Aedes albopictus, the obstreperous Asian tiger mosquito, might decide, for instance, that tires -- discarded by the billions and partly filled with water -- had been generously designed by humans as mosquito habitat. It might presume that an international trade in used tires had sprung up between parts of Asia and Houston -- ''the tire recapping capital of the world'' -- just to ensure comfortable homes for mosquito émigrés. Aedes aegypti, a mosquito that can transmit the yellow fever virus to humans and has been eradicated in much of Latin America, might reason that the North American obsession with property rights was meant solely to keep intrusive public health officials from seeking out and destroying its breeding areas. To some species, deforestation must seem like a public improvement and so must road-building and ditch-digging. Mosquitoes might at first have considered DDT to be a superweapon, but in fact its overuse has worked out in the long run to the advantage of resistant strains of mosquito, as did the overuse of chloroquine, the principal anti-malaria drug.</p>
        <p>''Mosquito'' is a timely natural history, arriving just when fears of West Nile virus, various forms of encephalitis and other mosquito-borne diseases are at their peak. But it's also a natural history of human behavior in the presence of mosquitoes. It chronicles the kinds of ''deception that people practice when they are trying their very hardest to do something grand, even heroic, in the face of a terrible problem'' like yellow fever or malaria. From a mosquito's point of view, that grandeur, that heroism, would look like nothing more than evolutionary hubris, the overconfidence of a larger, more intelligent but perhaps ultimately less resourceful species. For a time, politicians and public health officials believed that malaria could be utterly extirpated. But in the 1960's it returned with renewed vigor in chloroquine-resistant strains carried by DDT-resistant mosquitoes.</p>
        <p>Against some diseases -- yellow fever, especially -- the colossal anti-mosquito effort has been remarkably successful. But as Dr. Spielman points out again and again, it is often the simple gestures -- improved sanitation, good drainage and the use of window and door screens -- that have made the difference, rather than the grand gestures, the unlimited chemical campaigns.</p>
        <p>What would strike mosquitoes most, however, is their ''new'' place in history. Scarcely a century has passed since humans first learned to believe, where disease was concerned, that mosquitoes mattered at all.</p>
