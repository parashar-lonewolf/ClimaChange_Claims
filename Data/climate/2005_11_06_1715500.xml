        <p>When the president of China was scheduled to come to Washington in September, the White House planned a meeting and a quick working lunch -- and then canceled the whole thing because the president had to pay attention to Hurricane Katrina. So why did Charles and Camilla, the not-yet-king and his consort, merit a lunch, a lavish dinner and after-dinner entertainment that included Yo-Yo Ma?</p>
        <p>''Force of habit,'' said an aide to the president, who kept his name out of it because he received an invitation to the dinner. He meant his response as a joke, but there is something to it. Britain isn't even the shadow of the power it once was, but President Bush never goes to London without stopping by to see the queen. Add to that Prime Minister Tony Blair's unflagging support for the Iraq war and the fact that historical roots still count for something (though not much) in Washington.</p>
        <p>But sooner or later, in a hard-bitten capital consumed in scandal, war and competition with rising powers like China, might the royal family ever be considered irrelevant and thus dropped from the dinner list? ''That could happen,'' said Letitia Baldrige, who was Jacqueline Kennedy's chief of staff in an era when Britain counted for more. ''But I hope not in my lifetime. I was born dreaming of monarchies. I want to die that way.''</p>
        <p>Still, there was the question of what, exactly, the president and the prince talked about over all that beef and cheese: global warming, on which they have taken radically different views, was off limits. But Anglo-American warming is, apparently, always a safe harbor. As Christopher Buckley, the author and observer of Washington life, put it, referring to Mr. Bush, ''Considering what else is going on, it is probably a bit of a comfort zone to him.''</p>
