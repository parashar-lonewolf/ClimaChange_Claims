        <p>LEAD: SOME travelers think a change of scenery means a breath of fresh air, but if they're headed for Rio de Janeiro, Milan or Seoul - to name just a few cities - they are wrong. Air pollution has spread to most cities around the globe, turning skies gray, choking many residents and raining soot.</p>
        <p>SOME travelers think a change of scenery means a breath of fresh air, but if they're headed for Rio de Janeiro, Milan or Seoul - to name just a few cities - they are wrong. Air pollution has spread to most cities around the globe, turning skies gray, choking many residents and raining soot.</p>
        <p>Milan, a prime cultural and gastronomic destination, is an example.</p>
        <p>In May Franklin Heller of Stamford, Conn., who is 77 years old and asthmatic, stepped off a plane into a Milanese atmospheric inversion and doubled over. Gasping for breath, he was rushed to his air-conditioned hotel room, where he took medication to restore proper breathing. Later, Mr. Heller says, he ''couldn't walk more than 15 feet without having to stop and rest.'' He cut his 18-day trip short by several days.</p>
        <p>Mr. Heller, who has visited Milan several times, said he had never had difficulty in breathing there before. ''But we didn't anticipate the degree of air pollution,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A study published last year by the Global Environment Monitoring System, a continuing project sponsored by the World Health Organization and the United Nations Environmental Program, ranked Milan as the city with the world's highest air levels of sulfur dioxide, a potent lung irritant produced by the burning of coal and oil, although Shenyang in China, Teheran and Seul are near this level. There are several ways of measuring sulfur dioxide in the air. Using a different measure - the number of days on which pollution exceeds World Health Organization standards - Milan ranks 10th rather than first.</p>
        <p>The United Nations study, which covered the years 1980 to 1984, found several other cities using the air-level measure that came close to the levels of Milan, which reported a yearly average of 185 micrograms of sulfur dioxide per cubic meter of air. This is slightly more than three times the safety levels recommended by W.H.O.</p>
        <p>About 30 of the 50 cities monitored by the Global Environment Monitoring System regularly exceed W.H.O. standards set for sulfur dioxide, dust, lead, nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide, according to the report. Both the Monitoring System and the United States Environmental Protection Agency link an array of health problems to an excess of these pollutants. The problems include scarring of the lungs, caused by sulfur dioxide, dust and nitrogen oxide; nerve and kidney damage, caused by lead, and heart disease, exacerbated by carbon monoxide.</p>
        <p>The study, however, only hinted at the extent of the problem. Vast areas of Africa, Asia and South America are not monitored, in part because the project is intended to provide a representative sampling, rather than total global coverage. Other gaps exist because countries are too poor or unwilling to report data. Many countries ''either haven't gotten any monitoring equipment or they haven't gotten around to monitoring,'' said Hank de Koning, a Dutch W.H.O. official who helped prepare the study in Geneva. Mr. de Koning is now based in Washington.</p>
        <p>Mexico, for example, supplies no data on Mexico City, originally because the Government did not have the technology but now, says Mr. de Konig, because ''they have such high levels'' the Government may not wish to divulge them. However, its overall air pollution is considered the highest in the world. According to a report by the United Nations Environmenal Program issued in January, ozone levels in Mexico City have more than tripled since 1986 and now exceed E.P.A. standards 226 days of the year. Some five million tons of chemicals and suspended particles, including carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, are deposited in the air every year.</p>
        <p>In addition, the Global Environment Monitoring System does not track a pollutant that is drawing increasing attention from environmentalists: ozone, a poisonous form of pure oxygen and a lung irritant that forms in the lower layers of the atmosphere (to be distinguished from tropospheric ozone, which shields the earth from ultraviolet rays).</p>
        <p>One independent air pollution consultant, Michael Walsh, cautions that the figures in the study are not entirely reliable, although he acknowledges their value as standards of comparison. Mr. Walsh, who specializes in ozone problems in Mexico City and Sao Paulo, says the study's numbers tend to be low, out of date and ''full of holes.'' Mr. de Koning agrees that the complexity of gathering data from around the world makes it difficult for GEMS to verify its accuracy. ''We have to convince local agencies that collect the data to write to us,'' he said. ''We may occasionally have a city that is not so careful, but at the moment, this is the only way we can do it.</p>
        <p>With so much air pollution, often unreported, what can travelers do who may be at risk as a result? The American Lung Association, for example, estimates that about eight million Americans have asthma.</p>
        <p>''They could think about not going,'' said Dr. Warren D. Johnson Jr., director of the International Health Care Service of the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, which gives injections, medical advice and checkups to travelers.</p>
        <p>But staying away may not be possible. And although staying away in particularly hazardous times of the year may be the ideal solution, it is not always easy to decide which part of the year is the best. To some extent it depends on the city and its particular problem. When it comes to pollutants put into the air by road traffic or industry, says Bruce Jordan, chief of the air quality branh of the E.P.A, ''winter will hold the stuff up in the atmosphere.'' But for pollutants that form in the air as a result of chemical reaction, such as ozone, summer brings ''high-pressure, stagnant conditions in which stuff hangs around all day.''</p>
        <p>The first step for the cautious traveler is to identify the particular pollution problems of individual cities. The 1988 report is not available to the public, but an annual publication by the World Resources Institute, ''The World Resources Report,'' compiles lists based on data by the Global Environment System. Because of the time needed to process the information gathered from around the world the report is based on data that are generally about four years old; it is available at most large libraries.</p>
        <p>Sulfur dioxide levels in Milan remain far below the peaks reached during one heavy smog that environmentalists still point to as the worst in history - in London in 1952, when as much as 2,000 micrograms of sulfur dioxide were recorded in a cubic meter of air and 4,000 people died in December. (London then placed strict controls on coal-burning.) In descending order according to their levels of sulfur dioxide, Shenyang, Teheran, Seoul, Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Paris, Xian, Beijing, Madrid, Manila and Guangzhou are other cities an asthmatic might avoid or take precautions against before visiting. Air in the cities ranges from about 175 micrograms of sulfur dioxide per cubic meter to just over 60 micrograms. All exced the W.H.O. standard.</p>
        <p>According to the Global Environment Monitoring System, Paris violates W.H.O. standards on two counts - in the levels of carbon monoxide and lead, both products of road traffic. Carbon monoxide replaces oxygen in the bloodstream and can aggravate angina and other heart problems, according to the E.P.A. Its highest levels accrue in rush hours, making the air on main roads particularly unpleasant. Mr. Walsh says that when he goes to Paris he avoids cafes on main thoroughfares. ''You'll be sitting there and sipping chablis and getting gassed,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Other cities that have excessively high concentrations of carbon monoxide levels, particularly in rush hours, are, in descending order, Brisbane, Sao Paulo, Los Angeles, Melbourne, New York, Chicago, Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal. A 20-year plan to clean up the air of Los Angeles, the dirtiest in the United States, was recently announced by California's South Coast Air Quality Management District. The plan, which estimates anti-pollution measures at $3 billion a year, will be considered by the state Air Resources Board this month. The city is already under a court-appointed mandate to produce a blueprint for complying with E.P.A. standards for ozone, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and airborne particles by the year 2007.</p>
        <p>Lead accumulates in the bloodstream and cannot be flushed out. According to the E.P.A., it can attack the kidneys and nerves, and is particularly dangerous to children. W.H.O. sets acceptable limits of lead at 1 microgram per cubic meter of air, a level Paris and the following cities exceed: Baghdad, Sydney and Stockholm. Mexico City, however, probably ranks higher in tis category. While it does not provide data on amounts of lead in the air, it has reported to the Global Environment Monitoring System that its residents have more than 200 micrograms of lead per decaliter of blood - nearly twice as much as any other city reporting.</p>
        <p>Dust - known to environmentalists as ''suspended particulate matter'' - is an obvious lung irritant. Much of it spills into the air naturally, and some people try to filter it out by wearing surgical masks or scarves. According to the 1988 study, however, the greater part of the dust is made up of particles so tiny they could be spotted only with an electron microscope. Dust from the desert probably helped put Kuwait on top of the list of dusty cities, followed by industrial cities.</p>
        <p>The following cities, in descending order, exceed World Health Organization guidelines for dust particles a cubic meter: Shenyang, Xian, New Delhi, Beijing, Calcutta, Teheran, Jakarta, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Bangkok, Bombay, Kuala Lumpur, Zagreb, Rio de Janeiro, Bucharest, Accra, Lisbon, Manila and Chicago.</p>
        <p>Nitrogen oxide has been in the air for millions of years as a byproduct of lightning and decomposing soil but now, because of cars and fossil fuels, environmentalists deem it a pollutant. Nitrogen oxide damages the lungs and makes it harder to fight off respiratory infections, according to the E.P.A. Tel Aviv tops the list of cities with high nitrogen oxide levels, with Sydny, Santiago, Hamilton (Ontario) and West Berlin all exceeding W.H.O. recommendations for average daily levels.</p>
        <p>New York fares reasonably well in the study's rankings. It was sixth in nitrogen oxide content, with an annual average of about 65 micrograms per cubic meter (the United States standard is 100 micrograms per cubic meter). In sulfur dioxide, New York was No. 20 on the list, its annual average squarely in the middle of the W.H.O. guideline range. It was the 36th dustiest city covered in the study. In carbon monoxide levels, however, New York was the sixth highest, its peak levels placing it just below those of Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Travelers with asthma or emphysema who want to visit a city suspected of having severe air pollution should check with a doctor before planning a trip. A doctor can advise whether the trip should be taken or not and, if the advice is to go, can help find a pulmonologist in the destination city.</p>
        <p>SEVERAL doctors suggested that people with respiratory difficulties planning trips abroad should first test their lungs in an American city known to have high pollution levels. Dr. Ronald Crystal of the Heart, Lung and Blood Institute at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., says that if people can stand the air in Los Angeles, New York or Chicago, there's a good chance they can withstand air pollution abroad.</p>
        <p>Doctors also made these recommendations:</p>
        <p>Never pack medicine where it cannot be reached almost immediately, and it might be advisable to carry a duplicate bottle in case of theft or loss of a purse or bag.</p>
        <p>Don't exercise in a polluted city, or, if you must, exercise in the early morning or late evening, when the sun isn't forming ozone in the air and cars are not adding to the carbon monoxide and lead levels.</p>
        <p>The doctors also said that young children and the elderly are less able to handle air pollution.</p>
        <p>Dr. Johnson recommended that people with pulmonary problems should wear a surgical mask or silk scarf tied around the mouth and nose, especially in dusty cities. These will filter out dust and help keep the breath moist in dry air.</p>
        <p>If a traveler suffers a respiratory attack in a foreign city, Dr. Crystal of Washington said, a university hospital would tend to offer the best care.</p>
        <p>Travelers can also contact the local American Embassy or consulate, which keep lists of English-speaking medical specialists on hand. If necessary, the airline taking the traveler home should be asked to supply a wheelchair and oxygen.</p>
        <p>Still, commonsense should prevail. If pollen is making breathing difficult, if local atmospheric inversions are sending people indoors for hours, the traveler should think of going some place where the air is clean - Copenhagen; Caracas, Venezuela, Auckland, New Zealand, for instance, which are repeatedly rated among the cleanest cities in the study's various categories.</p>
        <p>Another suggestion: Craiova, Rumania.  AIR POLLUTANTS IN MONITORED CITIES</p>
        <p>Fifty cities around the world are monitored by the global Environment Monitoring System, a United Nations program. Because some countries do not take part, the findings are not comprehensive. PARTICULATE MATTER</p>
