        <p>If anyone needed more evidence that we are living through the most incongruous winter/early spring weather in generations, here are some facts from the last week:</p>
        <p>In urban and suburban areas throughout the country, most golf courses were open and sales for sunscreen and lawn fertilizer were booming. Meanwhile, at Jay Peak in Vermont, there has been four feet of snow in the last three weeks. Oregon's Mount Hood got six feet of snow in 10 days to increase its season total to 526 inches. At Whiteface Mountain in the New York Adirondacks, with recent powder softening the mountain's renowned steep trails, there is a move afoot to change the name to Niceface.</p>
        <p>For me, this snow-sports season began with a pathetic, largely fruitless search for a single snowy trail during the week after Thanksgiving. Three months later, after plowing my driveway once (and that was only because I was bored), we are having the best snow of the season. Go figure.</p>
        <p>There are a few lessons to be learned. To start, regardless of droughts, monsoons or global warming, some of the best skiing and riding of any season will always be in March and April, and the wise and worldly know it. Try, for example, to get a room in Vail, Colo., this weekend.</p>
        <p>More significantly, it is clear that nothing about the winter season was what it seemed.</p>
        <p>After the Sept. 11 attacks, after the economy soured and after all the warm weather in the Eastern valleys and cities over the winter, most people expected a calamitous season for the ski industry. It will instead turn out to be a decent season, even a good season, for most of the major resorts.</p>
        <p>Trade organizations throughout the country, except in the most Western states, are estimating that skier/snowboarder visits will be down 7 to 10 percent from the 2000-1 season. But then that season -- with especially abundant snowfall in the East -- was record-setting. Compared to the 10-year average, last season will probably be above average in terms of skier visits. In some California, Oregon and Washington areas, the season just past may be better than the earlier bonanza.</p>
        <p>''It's definitely not been as bad as people probably think,'' said Dirk Gouwens, president of the Ski Areas of New York State, home to more ski areas (52) than any other state in the nation. ''The numbers will be down because a warm December meant a later start, but in some ways costs will go down, too, because they were prepared to make more snow and did not. And it got cold just in time to save the Christmas week business. That was key.''</p>
        <p>In an interview on Jan. 2, Adam Aron, the chairman and chief executive of the Vail Resorts, was worried that the strong numbers from his resorts during the Christmas/New Year's Day holiday were a mirage. He cautioned that Sept. 11 could have a more lasting effect.</p>
        <p>''It turns out that no terrorist is going to stand in the way of people's cherished annual ski trip,'' Aron said. ''Advance bookings were anemic for January and February, and I think Sept. 11 put people in a holding pattern. But in the end, they decided to come.''</p>
        <p>It is one of the quirks of the ski industry that the largest resorts, the top 20 percent, account for 80 percent of business. So it is these major areas, with their technologically advanced snowmaking, better grooming and savvy marketing, that have had the strongest years. They also have higher elevations. Unquestionably, there have been some sketchy weeks with thin snow cover in the East, but most major areas still got 100 to 200 inches of snow, even if the crocuses have been growing for weeks.</p>
        <p>Still, at places like Ski Butternut in Great Barrington, Mass., business was off more than 10 percent. Without question it is the smaller mountains -- Butternut has 22 trails -- that have been hit the hardest. ''Visits were down pretty dramatically,'' Matt Sawyer, Butternut's director of marketing and sales, said.</p>
        <p>The ski areas of western Massachusetts, the Hudson Valley of New York and eastern Pennsylvania are much more reliant on consumers driving from nearby cities. ''When it's February and 60 degrees in New York City, nobody's thinking about skiing,'' Sawyer said.</p>
        <p>But the plucky, smaller areas have also learned to be resourceful in lean times. They know how to shave costs and are prudent enough to put something extra away after a good year so they can survive the rainy days (no pun intended).</p>
        <p>''The community areas are supported by their communities,'' Greg Sweetser, executive director of the Ski Maine Association, said. ''Everyone buys season passes and comes out almost as a matter of civic pride. Even if it's a half a day before taking the kids to basketball practice.''</p>
        <p>Or, this winter, to the golf course.</p>
        <p>But ski areas large and small will endure. It is not easy, like running a farm when the crop is sparse. Both walks of life tend to attract the hardy and hopeful.</p>
        <p>''I don't think you're going to see a trend of people closing their doors or anything like that,'' Sawyer said. ''People adjust. We'll be O.K. But we won't be buying new lifts this summer.''</p>
        <p>As with any sport, the saying applies: wait till next year.</p>
