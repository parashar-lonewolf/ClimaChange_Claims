        <p>LEAD: Television news or, if you will, information programming has come to a crossroads. One sign points in the direction of entertainment, complete with ever more breezy hosts and livelier graphics. The other leads to a more traditional brand of journalism, its emphasis on clear, simple, reliable reporting.</p>
        <p>Television news or, if you will, information programming has come to a crossroads. One sign points in the direction of entertainment, complete with ever more breezy hosts and livelier graphics. The other leads to a more traditional brand of journalism, its emphasis on clear, simple, reliable reporting. These alternatives are being vividly illustrated in two new half-hour nightly ''reports'' that made their debuts last week. As it happens, each production is connected to a national newspaper.</p>
        <p>''USA Today: The Television Show'' is in syndication, reportedly to 156 stations, most of them committed to the project for two years. In the New York area, the show is being carried on WCBS, but not until somewhere around 2 o'clock in the morning. This ''USA Today'' - produced by Steve Friedman, formerly of NBC's ''Today,'' for Grant Tinker's new GTG Entertainment - is determined to provide information in an entertaining manner. It focuses on four general areas: life, money, sports and, for a catchall, U.S.A. It seems abundantly clear that the show will hew to the concept heralded recently by Allen Neuharth, chairman of the Gannett Company, for USA Today, the newspaper: ''To satisfy your mind without stimulating or testing it too damned much.''</p>
        <p>''World Monitor,'' on the other hand, a co-production of The Christian Science Monitor and cable's Discovery Channel, is attempting nothing less than to provide a whole and balanced picture of the world. With Daniel Wilson as executive producer, Sandy Socolow as producer and John Hart as anchor, the program comes out of Boston and is hooked up to the paper's bureaus in Washington, London and Tokyo. There is a brief summary of the day's news but the key ingredients are essays on international figures and events. These can run from 6 to 12 minutes. ''World Monitor'' can be seen on weeknights at 7 P.M. on the Discovery Channel (which in Manhattan is carried only on Paragon).</p>
        <p>Here, then, are differences that could hardly be more dramatic. ''USA Today: The Television Show'' takes its artistic cues from MTV and ''Entertainment Tonight.'' It is an uncertain hybrid, described by its creators as not a news broadcast but not strictly entertainment. Its first week offered an avalanche of trivia clutter. Special interviews, with everybody from Michael S. Dukakis and George Bush to Elton John and Peter Ueberroth, were distinguished by their ability to impart absolutely no information within their two-minute limits. Special features were not just disappointing but downright insulting. A ''Money'' section about ''The Buck Family'' was constructed around the burning question of what to do with an unexpected bequest of $10,000 - buy a Jacuzzi or invest in a certificate of deposit. A real live ''financial planner'' was dragged on to offer this bit of advice: ''Every family should get together at least once a month for a family-planning dinner.'' That's if you can drag Mom away from the Jacuzzi, evidently.</p>
        <p>The show is taped at the Gannett building in Arlington, Va. Four attractive hosts, when not huddled together, stroll around an electronically sophisticated set, its dominating feature being a wall of television monitors, which, in repose, looks like a giant bay window. There are innumerable short features - What will people do for a million dollars? (about stunt performers); or, Kids: are they any different today? (well, in compiling lists, they know the names of more beer brands than American Presidents). And then there are even shorter items. Something called ''Snapshots'' reveals that mailing a letter in Japan is more expensive than in the United States, or that more people are fishing these days.</p>
        <p>Then, as in the newspaper, the television show is fond of polls, no matter how pointless. A telephone survey, for instance, found that most viewers thought Buffalo would be the best place for a new baseball franchise. Assorted experts agreed, however, that Tampa, Fla., or Denver were the best bets. So much for viewer input. At least for the time being, ''USA Today'' seems to be suffering from information diarrhea. True, as intended, there is no cynicism or negativism. And true, minds are not likely to be stimulated or tested. Nothing is likely to get in the way of its commercial messages. If all goes well, it seems, children will end up knowing even more about beer brands.</p>
        <p>''World Monitor'' has its kinks. Mr. Hart could liven up a bit without compromising his or the program's standards. Some of the international hookups get snarled in overlapping questions. But the sense of substance is unmistakable. Some of the style is clearly influenced by public television's ''MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour.'' The first week's lineup included reports from Chile and the Soviet Union. In an exclusive interview from London, King Hussein of Jordan commented on his recent actions concerning the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>From Mexico, the writer Carlos Fuentes expressed his exasperation with Reagan Administration policies in Central and South America. In Peru, mountain-range peasants spoke of being caught in the escalating violence of the Shining Path rebels. The question of nuclear power was discussed in the context of the greenhouse effect now being produced by traditional fuels. And the art of Edgar Degas was explored at the National Gallery in Ottawa in an exhibition coming next month to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. No flashy graphics. No pop music. No aggressively ingratiating hosts. The sheer integrity of ''World Monitor'' is invigorating.</p>
