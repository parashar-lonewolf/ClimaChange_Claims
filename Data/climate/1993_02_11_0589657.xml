        <p>The Valdez Principles, a code of corporate environmental conduct devised after the 1989 Alaskan oil spill, won its first major corporate endorsement yesterday. And the company that signed on is an oil company.</p>
        <p>The Sun Company of Philadelphia, the 12th-largest oil company in the United States, became the first Fortune 500 company to endorse the principles. Fifty smaller companies have already backed them.</p>
        <p>In May, a resolution endorsing the principles was submitted at the company's shareholder meeting by the New York City pension system but drew just 6 percent support. After the vote, though, management met with the principles' backers and worked out a compromise.</p>
        <p>Sun negotiated various "adaptations" of the principles to fit its business. For example, the first of the 10 principles, protection of the biosphere, says, "We will reduce and make continual progress toward eliminating the release of any substance that may cause environmental damage to the air, water, or the earth or its inhabitants." Some environmentalists would say that includes the pollutants that are released when Sun's gasoline is burned, as well as the carbon dioxide that adds to global warming. and is released when Sun's gasoline is burned.</p>
        <p>In the statement adopted by Sun, the company says, "We will reduce our overall emissions to the environment (air, water and land) with special emphasis on toxic substances."</p>
        <p>"This is not a commitment to go out of the petrochemical business or the fuels business," Sun's chairman and chief executive, Robert H. Campbell, said at a ceremony in New York yesterday. But, he said, there was "tremendous philosophical congruence" between what Sun was already doing and the environmental principles. He said, though, that he did not foresee major changes in company operations.</p>
        <p>The principles were renamed last year and now known as Ceres, for Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies. Joan Bavaria, co-chairwoman of Ceres, said discussions were continuing with other oil companies. Exxon is not among them, she said.</p>
