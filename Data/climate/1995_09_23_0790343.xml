        <p>Richie Williamson, a blacksmith, helped force open the bronze door of the crypt at Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn. In the dim light, on the nearest shelf, he could see a human jawbone, more than 200 years old, covered with blackened cobwebs.</p>

        <p>Richie Williamson, a blacksmith, helped force open the bronze door of the crypt at Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn. In the dim light, on the nearest shelf, he could see a human jawbone, more than 200 years old, covered with blackened cobwebs.</p>
        <p>He made the sign of the cross over his heart and prayed for the souls of 11,500 American heroes, men who died on prison ships in New York Harbor during the Revolutionary War. Some were within sight of their homes and farms in Brooklyn and Manhattan, but they refused to switch their allegiance to the King of England in exchange for their freedom.</p>
        <p>"This is a holy place," whispered Mr. Williamson. "Where would we be without these guys?"</p>
        <p>Early this week, for the first time since the Bicentennial in 1976, Mr. Williamson and other workers opened the crypt tucked inside the Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument. They found 20 heavy slate boxes, each two feet by two feet by seven feet, containing thousands of bone fragments. Graffiti on the crypt's white brick walls told of rare visits: 1973, 1908 and, one wag scribbled, 1776 -- before the tomb was even built, in 1908.</p>
        <p>Another message, scrawled in smudged pencil, expressed the hope that the beauty of the view from this, the summit of one of Brooklyn's highest hills, would bring some comfort to those forever resting.</p>
        <p>"This is hallowed earth," said James Rossi, a Parks Department supervisor. "It is the equivalent of Gettysburg or Valley Forge. I mean, these men walked with Washington."</p>
        <p>While the primary purpose of the crypt opening was to inspect the building for damage as part of a systematic review of all Parks Department structures, it was also intended to consider ways to make the monument, which was designed by the master architect Stanford White, more accessible to the public.</p>
        <p>It appears to be a time of renewal for Fort Greene Park and the monument itself. The crypt may be opened for occasional historic tours this spring. The Society of Old Brooklynites is making an artificial flame from gold leaf to sit atop the structure -- a 148-foot Doric column, said to be the largest in the world.</p>
        <p>The Parks Department and private supporters have also begun an effort to drum up public and private money to build a stairway inside the monument to its apex, at an estimated cost of $100,000. The original stairway and elevator were removed in 1949 after deterioration. Now, there is only a ladder to the top, off-limits to the public.</p>
        <p>"Who would stand for the Washington Monument being closed?" said Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern as he watched the opening. "This is New York's Washington Monument and it must be restored."  Mr. Stern, who was seeing the crypt's interior for the first time, has promised to repair crumbling marble and to return the four bronze eagles that had been put in storage to protect them against vandals.</p>
        <p>"It's not that people forget," he said, reflecting on a lost chapter in this nation's history. "It's that they never knew."</p>
        <p>The inscription over the crypt door is so worn as to be almost unreadable. There has been little citywide note since 1976, when King Juan Carlos of Spain dedicated a plaque honoring 700 Spanish martyrs who had fought for the United States and died on the prison ships.</p>
        <p>But each August, the Society of Old Brooklynites holds commemorations at the monument, an event that this year drew 100 people, twice the usual number. Recent research indicates some of the martyrs were black slaves fulfilling their masters' military obligations, a revelation that drew black veterans this year. A local youth corps of 125 black and Hispanic students is studying the history and is seeking foundation grants to set up an honor guard on weekends and special occasions.</p>
        <p>"It's the most historical spot from the beginning of the county there is," said Frank C. Spinner Jr., president of the Society of Old Brooklynites.</p>
        <p>Inside the crypt, the 20 boxes of shattered bones are unlabeled, though historians have identified some 8,000 who perished on British prison ships in Wallabout Bay, which was later filled in to make the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Because the prisons were brimming, the captives were kept on 11 ships from 1776 to 1783. After dying from hunger, disease or brutality, the men were buried near a bank of the East River, where many were washed away, provoking regular public outcries.</p>
        <p>Today, the monument to their memory is the soul of Brooklyn's first city park, a hilly, woodsy enclave of 30 acres marked by heavy historic footprints. Walt Whitman, as editor of The Brooklyn Eagle, pushed for the park's creation, which happened in 1850. The park was redesigned 17 years later by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, the team that had earlier designed Central Park. The ponderous, piercing column, finished in 1908, was Stanford White's final creation.</p>
        <p>The playgrounds and recreation areas are a product of Robert Moses, who built the modern New York City park system in the Depression.  There are towering elms in Fort Greene Park, the same trees prescribed by Olmsted and Vaux. There are the serpentine walks they designed to give the impression of a bucolic lane. There is the no-longer-used comfort station, modeled after a Greek temple.</p>
        <p>Recent basketball and tennis courts were partly financed by Spike Lee, the film maker, who lives nearby. A bright new playground has been built, and City Councilwoman Mary Pinkett has secured funds for another, as well as landscape restorations.</p>
        <p>"We're starting to spend some real bucks on this park," Mr. Rossi said, citing more than $1.4 million in city spending since last year.</p>
        <p>Still, both neighbors and Parks officials say there is much to be done, particularly to increase confidence that Fort Greene Park is safe. "We were pretty flabbergasted by the anarchy, by the fact the park is not properly managed," said Scott Emmons, a molecular genetics professor who lives near the park and recently became involved in helping rejuvenate the moribund Friends of Fort Greene Park, a volunteer group that hopes to press the Parks Department to improve maintenance.</p>
        <p>But for Fort Greene Park, resources have been a perennial, even historical, problem.</p>
        <p>Even when the American heroes became the centerpiece of Olmsted and Vaux's redesign of the park, financial authorities rejected the designers' idea for a grand mausoleum, authorizing only a modest vault. Nine years after President William Howard Taft personally dedicated the monument in 1908, the United States was allied with Britain in World War I, greatly dampening the appetite for anti-English memorials.</p>
        <p>Whitman himself complained about lack of maintenance money just 10 years after the park opened.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spinner of the Old Brooklynites notes that the eternal flame intended for the eight-ton urn at the top of the monument has never been lighted. Plans to light it about a decade ago collapsed when sponsors learned the cost would approach $10 an hour. Environmental regulators also warned that a flame would emit too much carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spinner's solution was to build and donate a fiberglass structure in the shape of a flame, then coat it with gold in the manner of the restored torch on the Statue of Liberty. It is being fabricated at his Brooklyn company, Spinner Industries, which makes truck-washing equipment, among other things. By day, sunlight will glint off the gold. By night, a light running on solar energy collected during the day will illuminate it.</p>
        <p>A marine in World War II, Mr. Spinner says he is driven by an awe of the courage of the long-ago prisoners of war, who could have saved themselves in an instant by claiming to switch sides. "There's no way I would have stayed on that ship and died," he said.</p>
