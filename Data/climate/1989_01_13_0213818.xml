        <p>LEAD: The meadow beneath my window is brown and the mountains beyond are more nearly gray with mist than white with snow. Is this merely a momentary setback for skiers - or a harbinger, in the middle of a cold Vermont winter, of another damaging drought next summer?</p>
        <p>The meadow beneath my window is brown and the mountains beyond are more nearly gray with mist than white with snow. Is this merely a momentary setback for skiers - or a harbinger, in the middle of a cold Vermont winter, of another damaging drought next summer?</p>
        <p>If the latter, these sere brown fields are of real significance, and not just to American farmers. They could mean that millions of the world's people, mostly in the poorest countries, will be facing a drastic food shortage this year, and probably into the next decade.</p>
        <p>As I understand a complicated story, some unusual climatic events in the Pacific Ocean resulted, last year, in moving the jet stream's flow across the United States substantially to the north. That, in turn, was the basic cause of the intense drought that baked much of the U.S. and caused the nation's grain harvest, for perhaps the only time in history, to fall below consumption - by an estimated 11 million metric tons.</p>
        <p>The jet stream apparently is still in its altered course, which may account in part for the unusually low winter precipitation I can verify by looking out my window. If that continues to be true this coming summer, another drought and another drastic drop in grain production could be on the way.</p>
        <p>The consequences of that are detailed by Lester Brown and John Young in the November/December 1988 issue of World Watch magazine. The United States, they explain, typically harvests 300 million tons of grain, consumes 200 million and exports or reserves the rest. But the 1988 crop was only 191 million tons; with domestic consumption taking 202 million tons, reserve stocks had to be used both to bridge the gap and to provide grain for exports.</p>
        <p>United States grain production in 1987 was also below normal - only 277 million tons. The effect on world supplies of these two bad years back-to-back was drastic, because the world depends so heavily on North America (the United States and Canada) for its grain. In 1988 North America exported 119 million tons of grain, against only 22 million for Western Europe, the next-largest exporter.</p>
        <p>The world already would be in a ''food emergency'' had there not been record stocks of grain on hand at the beginning of 1987, to replace harvesting shortfalls that year and in 1988. As it is, Mr. Brown and Mr. Young estimate, ''World carryover stocks will drop to 54 days of consumption'' before the 1989 harvest.</p>
        <p>That's dangerously low. When world grain reserves were at a record high, 459 million tons in 1987, they could have fed the world, if necessary, for only 101 days. In 1972, moreover, when only 57 days of grain reserves were available, world grain prices doubled.</p>
        <p>What will happen, the authors ask, if a drought in 1989 is comparable in severity to 1988? Their answer is chilling:</p>
        <p>''U.S. grain exports would slow to a trickle. The world would face a food emergency for which there is no precedent in the decades since North America emerged as the world's breadbasket. There would be a frantic scramble for the available supplies as world grain prices soared to record levels. Affluent countries might be forced to consider cutting their use of feed grain so that poor nations did not starve.''</p>
        <p>Even if the jet stream returns to a more usual course, harvests could still be down in this and coming years, owing to the so-called ''greenhouse effect'' - a general warming of the earth's atmosphere, caused by the excessive discharge of carbon dioxide and other gases. Scientists disagree about the seriousness of the problem, but most agree there is one - and laymen hardly have to be told that the five warmest years of the last century occurred in the 80's, topped by 1988.</p>
        <p>A rise of 3 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit in average global temperatures, some computer models suggest, could happen by the year 2030 if no global action is taken. That obviously would damage farm productivity seriously, in the U.S. and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Even today, with grain available but unevenly distributed, about 950 million of the world's people are provided too few calories to do a day's work; 80 percent live in poor nations. That's bound to get worse, drought or no drought, greenhouse or no greenhouse, since U.N. experts predict that by 2025 today's worldwide population of 5 billion will have reached 8.2 billion, and counting. Most of the growth will be in poor nations.</p>
        <p>So let's hope I'm only seeing an ordinary January thaw outside my window, instead of bad news from the jet stream.</p>
