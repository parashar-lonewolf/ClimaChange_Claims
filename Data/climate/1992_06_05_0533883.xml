        <p>The World Bank has proposed that the United States and other aid-giving countries contribute $5 billion to a fund that would provide virtually free grants to help the world's poorest countries protect their ecological systems, officials disclosed here today.</p>

        <p>The World Bank has proposed that the United States and other aid-giving countries contribute $5 billion to a fund that would provide virtually free grants to help the world's poorest countries protect their ecological systems, officials disclosed here today.</p>
        <p>The plan is being pressed by the World Bank president, Lewis T. Preston, who wrote to the donor countries last week explaining his plan to add a $5 billion "earth increment" to a World Bank subsidiary known as the International Development Agency when its funds are replenished next year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Preston made his plan public today when he addressed delegates attending the Earth Summit.</p>
        <p>Officials say the United States, which contributes 22 percent of the development agency's funds, has said it will consider the plan, and other donors appear to be supportive. Reserved for the Poorest</p>
        <p>The World Bank proposal is one of several schemes under debate for raising the estimated $70 billion in new aid that developing countries say they will need annually to pay for an ambitious global environmental cleanup plan known as Agenda 21, which is expected to be approved at the Earth Summit.</p>
        <p>Without a substantial increase in aid, the third world says it cannot afford to continue its development in ways that will safeguard the environment.</p>
        <p>Officials say the World Bank fund would be earmarked for projects designed to protect the environment in countries with annual per capita incomes of up to $740.</p>
        <p>If donor countries agree to finance the proposal, Mr. Preston told the Earth Summit today, the World Bank will contribute a "substantial" portion of its annual profit of about $1.5 billion, instead of using this money to subsidize loans to developing countries that are more financially stable. Diplomatic Tug of War</p>
        <p>Currently, about 70 countries are poor enough to qualify for development agency loans, which are intended to help countries who are excluded from the commercial loan market and who cannot even afford the World Bank's normal lending terms. Money borrowed from the development agency is repayable over 35 to 40 years and carries a nominal interest rate that is usually suspended for the first 10 years.</p>
        <p>Rich and poor countries are locked in a diplomatic struggle here over other ways of raising the additional aid the third world demands as its price for cooperating with Agenda 21 and the new conventions being considered at the summit meeting on stabilizing the climate and protecting the world's biological diversity.</p>
        <p>Originally the developing countries wanted all the additional environmental aid channeled through a Green Fund under their control which would make loans with no strings attached.</p>
        <p>But donor countries were united in opposing this. Instead, they are offering an expansion of the World Bank's Global Environment Facility, set up two years ago to back environmental projects in the third world, together with reforms designed to give recipients a greater say in how it operates. Wariness of World Bank</p>
        <p>"There is a consensus emerging among donors in favor of doubling or even tripling the G.E.F. from its present level of $1.3 billion when it comes up for renewal next year," Mohammed al-Ashry, the agency's Egyptian chairman, said in an interview.</p>
        <p>But developing countries are wary of the World Bank, which is effectively controlled by the donor countries. The compromise being offered is to create a new assembly that would set broad policy guidelines by consensus. Both wealthy and developing coutries represented would have veto power, but specific loan proposals would still require World Bank approval.</p>
        <p>The third world countries have agreed that the Global Environment Facility should primarily finance projects designed to prevent global warming, protect endangered species, clean up international waterways and fight depletion of the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>To find the bulk of the extra $70 billion, the developing countries are pressing donors to make good by the end of the century on their longstanding commitment to contribute up to 0.7 per cent of their total economic output in development aid.</p>
        <p>Currently, rich northern countries are giving about 0.45 percent of their wealth in aid, which amounts to some $55 billion a year. Raising this contribution to 0.7 percent would bring the total close to what the developing world needs to pay for the Agenda 21 plan.</p>
        <p>But the United States, which currently gives about 0.21 percent of its wealth in foreign aid, has always refused to accept the 0.7 percent target.</p>
