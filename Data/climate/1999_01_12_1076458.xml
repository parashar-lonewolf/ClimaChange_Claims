        <p>Like giant feathers slowing rising on the winds to impossible heights, large gossamer wings made of wispy plastics and light composite materials are flying at altitudes where few airplanes have soared.</p>
        <p>Following a recent round of successful test flights, engineers are modifying an unmanned flying wing called Centurion for an attempt at becoming the first aircraft to achieve sustained level flight at 100,000 feet.</p>
        <p>Centurion is the latest in a line of solar-powered flying wings that have steadily pushed up altitude records for remote-controlled and propeller-driven aircraft. Last August, a predecessor aircraft named Pathfinder-Plus, using sunlight to generate power for its electric engines, set an unofficial world altitude record for propeller planes of 80,201 feet.</p>
        <p>The goal of these studies is to build a fleet of relatively inexpensive drone aircraft that can routinely operate at these extreme altitudes for scientific and commercial purposes.</p>
        <p>Centurion and similar drones are part of a program sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to develop remotely piloted aircraft that can loiter at the edge of the atmosphere, far above normal air traffic.</p>
        <p>''We have made an enormous amount of progress in a relatively short period of time,'' said Jeffrey Bauer, deputy manager for NASA's Environmental Research Aircraft and Sensor Technology Program. ''We have identified the technologies that are needed and now have to figure out how to make them work together, but we don't see any large showstoppers.''</p>
        <p>Several aircraft sponsored by the Erast program, which was established in 1994 and has an annual budget of about $20 million, each had a successful series of test flights last year, including the Centurion. ''We are close to making the transition from test vehicles to vehicles that are ready for scientific and commercial applications,'' Mr. Bauer said.</p>
        <p>Scientists hope that solar-powered versions of Centurion and its successors will revolutionize studies of the upper atmosphere, a crucial but difficult-to-sample region important to climate change.</p>
        <p>There, at altitudes from 12 to 20 miles above the Earth, engineers envision aircraft that will eventually be able to stay aloft for days or weeks at a time, performing jobs previously relegated to space satellites, but cheaper and better. Such planes could serve as communications outposts in the sky, relaying telephone or pager signals, or follow hurricanes and other adverse weather systems, constantly monitoring their progress and studying their behavior, as well as performing surveillance, experts say.</p>
        <p>These aircraft, carrying a new generation of miniature sensors and scientific instruments, would be able to linger in the lower regions of the stratosphere studying chemical interactions many scientists believe are damaging the Earth's protective ozone layer. And scientists say flying such planes over the planet's poles could provide valuable insight into the seasonal ozone holes that appear each year.</p>
        <p>In addition, such craft could help monitor and measure carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases accumulating in the atmosphere that some scientists believe are contributing to global warming and possible climate changes.</p>
        <p>Because of the wide range of potential jobs for high-altitude robot craft, NASA is looking at developing a range of aircraft, including more conventional designs than solar wings. Last summer, Aurora Flight Sciences of Manassas, Va., conducted four successful flights under the Erast program with its Perseus B, a drone powered by a turbocharged piston engine turning a propeller attached to the plane's tail.</p>
        <p>The Perseus B, essentially a 2,200-pound powered glider with a conventional wing and tail configuration, reached 60,000 feet with a 180-pound payload, said Aurora's president, John S. Langford. In tests this summer, Aurora hopes to increase the plane's endurance at this altitude to 8 hours, and reach 24 hours or more the following year. ''At that point, we can go into production and offer leased flight services to the scientific market, including universities, national laboratories and others,'' Mr. Langford said.</p>
        <p>Current methods of doing studies in the upper atmosphere have severe drawbacks. Satellites can peer into this region with remote instruments, but they orbit too high to do direct air sampling. High-flying aircraft, like the U-2 and SR-71 spy planes, can operate at 70,000 feet or more, but they can only stay at these altitudes for a few hours and are very expensive to operate. In addition, the spy planes fly so fast that they disturb the air, which interferes with direct sampling.</p>
        <p>Balloons have been a mainstay of high-altitude studies for decades, but they can leak gases that pollute air samples and are notoriously hard to control, as has been evident in recent years by the many failed attempts by balloonists to circle the globe.</p>
        <p>These shortcomings call for new methods to study the upper atmosphere, and some scientists and engineers see slow-speed, long-duration robot aircraft as the solution.</p>
        <p>Centurion has drawn a great deal of attention because a solar-powered craft like this has the potential of becoming the long-desired ''eternal airplane'' that seldom has to land. And Centurion is a stepping stone to an operational craft called Helios that would be essentially an airborne satellite, according to its builder, Aerovironment Inc., of Monrovia, Calif., a company that specializes in electric-powered vehicles.</p>
        <p>Centurion is a giant, superlight wing with no tail that evolved from smaller models Aerovironment started building 15 years ago. In the early 1980's, the company got a secret government contract to build a pilotless, solar-powered, propeller-driven craft that could stay at high altitudes for weeks at a time. Aerovironment built a prototype, called Pathfinder, which made nine, battery-powered flights in the summer of 1983 before the project was canceled when it failed to meet specifications.</p>
        <p>The program was revived in 1994 by the Defense Department and declassified. The Pathfinder prototype reappeared after being stored for a decade in a secret location, but the new project, to build a long-duration surveillance plane, was canceled shortly thereafter when it lost funding. NASA then took over the project and used new technology to make a larger version of the craft, called Pathfinder Plus.</p>
        <p>W. Ray Morgan, an Aerovironment vice president who directs its Design and Development Center, said that when the early Pathfinder program was declassified, the only facts that remained secret were the name of the original sponsor and the craft's intended mission. ''We have entertained ourselves endlessly around here speculating on who and what they were,'' Mr. Morgan said.</p>
        <p>The original Pathfinder had six engines and a wingspan of 98 feet, while Pathfinder Plus grew to eight engines and a 121-foot wing. Centurion dwarfs both with 14 engines --  each of which turn a twin-blade 79-inch propeller -- and a 206-foot wingspan, wider than that of a Boeing 747 jumbo jet. The wing of the craft measures 8 feet from front to rear, is only about 11.5 inches thick and rests on four fairings or pods that contain its landing gear and electronics.</p>
        <p>The aircraft, which has an empty weight of only about 1,175 pounds, so far has cost about $7 million to design and build. It is so light because it is fabricated from tough carbon fiber and graphite epoxy composite materials, as well as the Kevlar fabric used in bulletproof vests, Styrofoam, and a plastic film covering. The wing is built in five segments; a 44-foot-long center section is flanked by two panels on each side that individually measure slightly over 40 feet. The outermost panels have a noticeable 10-degree upsweep to help lateral stability in flight and a slight upward twist at the tips of the trailing edge.</p>
        <p>Mr. Morgan said each wing section is so stable it can fly on its own, allowing the plane to get bigger, while still remaining controllable, by adding new sections. ''It's an airplane you can buy by the yard,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''It works like several aircraft flying in close formation, but they happen to be structurally interconnected,'' Mr. Morgan added.</p>
        <p>The plane flies at only 17 to 21 miles per hour. With no rudder or tail, it turns and banks by slowing down or speeding up different motors on the outboard sections of the wing.</p>
        <p>Centurion successfully made its first three flights this past November and December at NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center at Edwards, Calif., but the craft flew on its backup lithium-sulfur dioxide batteries and not solar power. Engineers said they did not want to risk damaging the craft's delicate and expensive solar power cells on these low-level early flights designed to test stability, handling and load carrying.</p>
        <p>Besides, Aerovironment only has enough of these special solar cells to cover one of the plane's five sections. The high-efficiency silicon cell arrays, which convert 19 percent of the sun's rays striking them into electricity, cost about $1.8 million per section; the company needs another $7 million that has yet to be funded to finish four more panels.</p>
        <p>Centurion was airborne a total of about three-and-a-half hours on its maiden flights, only venturing a few hundred feet off the ground to check the craft's handling and its extensive automatic control system. On its final flight, it carried a 600-pound simulated payload that was about half its empty weight. ''This flight went a long way in showing that even though solar-powered airplanes appear delicate and fragile, they really have the muscle necessary to do big jobs,'' said John Del Frate, Dryden's project manager for solar aircraft.</p>
        <p>Engineers plan to add another section to Centurion, giving it a span of almost 250 feet, for the next series of flights this spring or summer. Although these trials also will be battery-powered, Mr. Morgan said this configuration should be able to reach the 100,000-foot goal when solar cells are installed, perhaps in another two or three years, depending upon funding.</p>
        <p>There is a debate over whether a robot drone really needs to fly as high as 100,000 feet to meet most scientific objectives because operating this high penalizes the aircraft's performance. For every additional 13,000 feet of altitude, air density drops in half and a plane has to fly 40 percent faster to stay up, Mr. Morgan said.</p>
        <p>Helios, the ultimate solar plane, is being designed to work between 50,000 and 70,000 feet and stay there for weeks using solar power by day and a rechargeable fuel cell system at night.</p>
        <p>However, Mr. Morgan said, a goal of Centurion is to operate at 100,000 feet because of a 1996 challenge from the NASA administrator, Daniel S. Goldin.</p>
        <p>''Goldin felt that if we could operate at 100,000 feet, it would prove that NASA could fly a plane in the thin Martian atmosphere under similar conditions, which they want to do,'' Mr. Morgan said.</p>
