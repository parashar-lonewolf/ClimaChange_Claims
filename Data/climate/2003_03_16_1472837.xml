        <p>FIVE years ago, Robert and Deborah Fischman paid Con Ed $1,000 a month during the winter to heat their four-bedroom colonial in South Salem.</p>
        <p>By last month, the familys utility bill had dropped to $400. What changed? Worried about both the environment and his budget, Mr. Fischman, a civil engineer, decided four years ago to convert his 3,000-square-foot house to a ''green'' building. He replaced the homes all-electric heating system with a geothermal pump, which draws heat from the earth in winter and sheds it into the ground in summer through a system of buried plastic pipes called a ground heat exchanger.</p>
        <p>Not only have Mr. and Mrs. Fischman and their three children been basking in the cost-effective warmth of geothermal heat ever since, but they have also gained new respect in their neighborhood. These days when guests stop by, the conversation invariably turns to the unassuming box in the basement, where a furnace would usually be found. The new system is a winner on two counts, the Fischmans explain: it keeps their home at 70 degrees Fahrenheit winter and summer, and it eliminates emissions from the site that traditional fossil fuel heating systems give off.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fischman, who works for Andron Construction Corporation in Goldens Bridge, predicts that in time, homes like his will become less of a curiosity and more mainstream. ''Especially as peoples values focus increasingly on conserving our environment,'' he said, ''well see a lot more of them.''</p>
        <p>In Westchester recently, as in the rest of the country, interest in green construction has grown sharply. Adding to concerns about rolling power failures, soaring fuel costs and dependence on foreign oil is another worry specific to Westchester: if the Nuclear Regulatory Commission closes down the Indian Point nuclear power plant, which provides between 18 and 38 percent of the energy for New York City and the lower Hudson Valley, how will that that energy be replaced?</p>
        <p>Environmentalists, citizen groups and public officials, including the Westchester County Executive, Andrew J. Spano, have called for the closing of the two nuclear power plants at Indian Point in Buchanan run by Entergy, in large part because of the threat to Westchester if they were to become the focus of a terrorist attack.</p>
        <p>Westchester itself is stepping up efforts to find alternatives to traditional energy sources. It already has a solar system at work at its Yonkers Joint Wastewater Treatment Plant. The solar panels, called photovoltaic tiles, which are on the roof of the plants administration building, produce about 100 kilowatts of power at any given time and save about $10,000 a year, said Adam J. Zabinski, deputy commissioner for the countys Department of Environmental Facilities. Also, the sludge processing produces 1.2 million cubic feet of methane gas daily, which in turn is used to fire boilers at the treatment plant. Estimated savings by using the gas byproduct is about $75,000 a year, Mr. Zabinski said.</p>
        <p>The goal of green construction is to make buildings more energy efficient by minimizing environmental impact and reducing energy use, often according to standards set by the United States Green Building Council, a national coalition of leaders from the building industry and environmental organizations.</p>
        <p>A green approach to energy is not new, of course. During the 1970's, strategies to conserve fuel included driving smaller cars, turning down thermostats and wearing more sweaters, following the example set by President Jimmy Carter. Americans also began recycling trash, using low-flow shower heads to reduce water consumption, installing Thermopane windows and adopting other energy-saving strategies. Strategies like recycling had staying power, but others did not, observed Alexander Roberts, president of Roberts Geo Systems, an energy management consulting concern in Pleasantville. The most notable example of Americans discarding conservation efforts, Mr. Roberts said, has been their love affair with S.U.V.'s and other large vehicles with low gas mileage.</p>
        <p>The question now is whether the new zeal for energy conservation will prevail this time around.</p>
        <p>''The crucial difference between then and now,'' said Mr. Roberts, ''was that then conserving energy meant doing without or with less, whereas today many of the new green technologies like geothermal heating and compact fluorescent light bulbs actually improve comfort and work better. Even better, they also offer a clear economic benefit that people can see in pocketbooks, which is a powerful motivator.''</p>
        <p>Relying on Light And Local Materials</p>
        <p>Geothermal heat pumps and solar energy are both used in green construction. Often such construction depends on daylight for illumination and uses lights that automatically dim depending on the natural light available. A green building is designed to insulate efficiently and has either Thermopane or specially glazed windows. Such buildings also use construction materials like wood from renewable forests, steel with a high content of recycled materials, locally quarried stone, nontoxic paints and carpets, and ceramic tiles made with recycled glass.</p>
        <p>Builders, homeowners and commercial property owners are embracing green construction and predicting that it will soon gain wide acceptance. ''We call it green construction now, but it wont be long before we take it for granted and dont refer to it as something special,'' said Bill Balter, a coowner of Wilder Balter Partners, builders in Elmsford. ''Even in less than a decade, it will probably be the norm.''</p>
        <p>Some materials, like low-emission insulating glass, are already commonly used by builders. Geothermal heat pumps have proved to be highly reliable but are not common. Still there are some high-profile customers: President Bush had one installed in his ranch home in Crawford, Tex., and Vice President Dick Cheney's official home, the Naval Observatory in Washington, uses geothermal heat pumps. Mr. Balter has installed a geothermal heat pump as a test case in one of 15 luxury homes he is building at Arrowcrest Estates at Hunterbrook in Yorktown. ''Eventually well be doing it in more developments,'' he said. ''For now, were trying it out here and working out the kinks.''</p>
        <p>The mechanics of such a system are simple: using the constant temperature of the earth below the frost line, a pump forces water through piping connected to a buildings heating and cooling system. During the summer, excess heat from the building is shed into the ground through the system for cooling, and during the winter, heat is drawn from the ground.</p>
        <p>The typical cost for such a system is about $7,500, according to the United States Department of Energy. The investment can often be recouped within 2 to 10 years in utility bill savings, studies from the energy department show. The underground piping used comes with a 25- to 50-year warranty, and the pumps themselves typically last 20 years or longer. Also, the state offers tax incentives and rebates for installing geothermal systems.</p>
        <p>Savings at a Country Club And a High School</p>
        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki has been New Yorks major champion of new energy technologies and green construction. He has ordered the state to buy at least 20 percent of its energy from geothermal and other renewable sources by 2010. Incentives are available for installing geothermal systems, solar-electric and wind-generation systems. In 2000, the state passed the countrys first Green Building Tax Credit, a $25 million income tax credit program for owners and tenants of buildings that meet certain energy, indoor air quality, materials, water conservation, appliance and size criteria. The state has distributed money to more than 600,000 individuals and other businesses from the beginning of its public benefit program in 1998.The program is financed at $150 million a year.</p>
        <p>Rebates and savings can be substantial. On a Croton-on-Hudson home that was used last year to educate the public about solar heat, photovoltaic panels were installed for $25,000, with state rebates and tax advantages amounting to $14,000, according to Federated Conservationists of Westchester, an umbrella organization of environmental groups.</p>
        <p>The Westchester Country Club in Rye recently installed a geothermal system as part of a $7 million project to reduce energy consumption by 775,000 kilowatt hours, saving $130,000 annually on energy costs and reducing fossil fuel emissions linked to smog, acid rain, global climate changes and respiratory ailments.</p>
        <p>The geothermal system at the country club was installed by R. J. Dooley &amp; Associates, a seven-year-old Poughkeepsie engineering and construction firm that is also installing the geothermal unit at Wilder Balter's Arrowcrest Estates at Hunterbrook. The company's owner, Robert Dooley, is converting a 60,000-square-foot former brewery and hotel built in the mid-1800's on the Hudson River waterfront in Poughkeepsie to offices and a restaurant and has installed a geothermal unit there, too.</p>
        <p>To encourage more green construction of schools, the state Energy Research and Development Authority has awarded $20,000 grants to 50 public and private schools, including Somers High School in Westchester. School Power Naturally, as the program is called, is designed to raise students' awareness of the importance and promise of solar energy. Schools chosen for the project are also getting weather stations to aid them in collecting and analyzing their data.</p>
        <p>Somers High is installing a solar collector on the south wall of its gymnasium, which will provide the school with two kilowatts of electricity per month, said Brian Hugick, a science teacher at the school. As a point of comparison, the teacher said, the average home uses about four kilowatts a month; the school uses between 228 and 378 kilowatts a month.</p>
        <p>Even though two kilowatts is a relatively small savings, ''it will help us get off the grid,'' Mr. Hugick explained. The teacher is showing lab students in his Contemporary Issues in Science course how solar energy can be used to power pollution-free model cars and cooking equipment.</p>
        <p>Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers is going green on a bigger scale, spending $25 million to build a 60,000-square-foot center for the visual arts using recycled and renewable materials including the rock removed from the ground during construction. The design focuses on minimizing water and energy use and includes a geothermal system. The building is expected to open in the fall of 2004.</p>
        <p>Counting Kilowatts At the Power Authority</p>
        <p>The New York Power Authority installed new energy-efficiency technologies at the Clarence D. Rappleyea Building, the authoritys headquarters in White Plains. It began the $3.8 million project to address the governors ''Green and Clean State Buildings'' order, requiring state-owned buildings to achieve reductions in energy use of at least 35 percent by 2010, based on 1990 consumption levels. Along with anticipated energy savings of 50 percent, the White Plains office improvements are expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 4,100 tons a year.</p>
        <p>At the Kenneth S. Warren Institute, a medical research center in Yorktown, major renovations are under way to make the building into an oil-free building, said Learned J. Hand, the institutes executive director. Situated on the grounds of Yorktowns 15-acre Kitchawan Preserve near the Croton Reservoir, the 15,000-square-foot building is heated primarily with a geothermal heat pump system.</p>
        <p>''Our eventual goal is to be totally oil free,'' Mr. Hand said. ''But no matter how green a building is, when its 5 degrees outside, you want some backup oil.''</p>
        <p>Chuck Lowden, the institutes chief engineer, said the nonprofit group was also considering the installation of solar panels and a propane-powered generator to serve as a backup source of power in case of a power failure. ''Especially in a rural area, you dont want to put all your eggs in one basket,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Electric Cars And Building Regulations</p>
        <p>Municipalities, too, have accepted the charge to become more green. White Plains, for example, has installed variable frequency motors at its water pumping facilities and at its public library, said Joseph Nicoletti Jr., commissioner of Public Works and the city engineer. The motors slow down or speed up in response to changing conditions instead of continually running at full speed. The city also retrofitted 4,400 streetlights with high-pressure sodium bulbs, which have a long life and high output. A new parking garage has been designed with light sensors so that outside rows are artificially lighted only when there is inadequate daylight.</p>
        <p>The city's fleet of vehicles has also become more environmentally friendly, including cars powered by electricity, natural gas and alcohol. ''The maintenance on these vehicles is considerably less, the cost of refueling an electric car is almost nil, and complaints about noise during night street sweeping are considerably reduced'', Mr. Nicoletti said. ''In addition, the environmental hazards and constant monitoring and testing required of underground fuel storage facilities is eliminated for those vehicles.''</p>
        <p>The town of Greenburgh passed a new law about a year ago mandating energy-efficient construction of all new homes. The law says no building permit can be issued for a new one- or two-family home or a dwelling of three stories or fewer unless the applicant certifies that the building will meet New York Energy Star Labeled Home guidelines. The guidelines stipulate improved insulation, windows designed to improve thermal performance, high efficiency heating and cooling systems that are properly sized for the home, and reduced air infiltration, among other things.</p>
        <p>Steven Winter, chairman of the United States Green Building Council and president of Steven Winter Associates, an architectural firm in Norwalk that designs green projects nationwide, said that however laudable the ideas of green construction are, it could take as much as a generation for the principles and practices of it to become mainstream.</p>
        <p>There is the natural disinclination of some people to make the effort to change, he observed: ''Sometimes they're selfish, lazy or just indifferent and not willing to take time to recycle or institute other energy-saving measures. Their attitude is, 'The heck with it.' ''</p>
        <p>There are also some business concerns oil companies, for example, he said that would prefer consumers to maintain their dependence on fossil fuels. ''Any time theres a change,'' Mr. Winter said, ''there are status quo interests that resist it.''</p>
