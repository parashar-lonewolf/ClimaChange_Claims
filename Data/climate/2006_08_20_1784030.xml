        <p>A MANATEE has recently been reported lolling about the confluence of the Croton and Hudson Rivers in the vicinity of several Westchester County yacht clubs. Evidently it is unaware of the long waiting list for membership and moorings.</p>
        <p>The news media have treated sightings of this large sirenian as more evidence of the transformation of the New York metropolitan area into ''Where the Wild Things Are.'' Bears in New Jersey, coyotes in Central Park, manatees beneath the Tappan Zee Bridge. Can it be long before wolverines give hedge fund managers a run for their money in Connecticut?</p>
        <p>But there may be another reason why this maverick manatee refused to spend another hot summer in Florida. Thanks to global warming, Trichecus manatus can spend it with us.</p>
        <p>In this the manatee is not alone. A quarter of a century ago, brown pelicans were as rare in this neck of the woods as, well, wolverines. Now the state bird of Louisiana cruises the coasts of New Jersey and Long Island every summer, skimming over the water in single-file troupes.</p>
        <p>The lesson here is that canaries in coal mines don't have to be yellow. Birds of all colors and sizes can give advance warning of changes in the environment and climate. Long before the discovery of global warming and the invention of the Internet, and well in advance of the manatee, several American birds whose ranges had been pretty much confined to the South began to creep up the East Coast like kudzu or Nascar. Yes, Al Gore's avian army includes not only penguins but also, much closer to home, turkey vultures, tufted titmice and cardinals.</p>
        <p>According to the 1949 edition of Richard Pough's ''Audubon Land Bird Guide'' and his 1951 ''Audubon Water Bird Guide,'' two of the manuals I used when I began bird watching, titmice and cardinals ventured no farther north than New Jersey -- the Hudson River was a brick wall -- and turkey vultures called it quits in Connecticut. (Brown pelicans occasionally wandered up to North Carolina.)</p>
        <p>Once I was bird watching at Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge, straddling Brooklyn and Queens, when I fell in with an Englishman from the Isle of Wight with the Dickensian name of David Hunnybun. Although the refuge teemed with rare birds that day, including an astounding curlew or stint usually found in Alaska, what transfixed Mr. Hunnybun was a commonplace cardinal, which has no equivalent in Europe. Fifty years ago, the sight of a cardinal in Connecticut could be almost as arresting.</p>
        <p>These days the most popular bird book is ''The Sibley Guide to Birds.'' Its range maps show that turkey vultures spend summers on the coast of Maine with Martha Stewart, David Rockefeller and Brooke Astor's daughter-in-law, while titmice and cardinals have made inroads in less fashionable inland Maine as well. A friend of mine frequently ticks off titmice on the Christmas Bird Count in gelid Orono, Maine.</p>
        <p>When these population shifts became apparent, their causes were unclear. In the introduction to the 1980 edition of his famous ''Field Guide to the Birds,'' Roger Tory Peterson, who ruled the roost before David Sibley, speculated that the proliferation of bird feeders might have something to do with it. If so, Peterson concluded modestly, his guides ''may have played no small part in these range expansions -- by introducing birds to so many people.''</p>
        <p>Peterson, who did more than anyone to popularize bird watching in America in the 20th century, was not misguided. Feeding birds has certainly extended some of their ranges. Doubtless many other factors are at play, and one of these must surely be global warming.</p>
        <p>Manatees eat underwater vegetation, so no one is feeding them. They forage mostly at night, when only a diver with a head lamp can observe them. During the day a manatee ordinarily snoozes underwater, surfacing only occasionally for a gulp of air. That's why the sightings in Westchester County have been brief and sporadic.</p>
        <p>Anyone who has survived this sizzling summer in the city or its suburbs so far knows about global warming. As I was driving home after seeing ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' in which Al Gore warns that global warming increases the violence and unpredictability of storms, a microburst uprooted a massive pin oak that dented the roof of my house and destroyed my deck and fence. I don't know about you, but I can't wait to join those turkey vultures on the coast of Maine, where it's at least a little bit cooler.</p>
