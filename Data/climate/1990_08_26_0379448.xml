        <p>All it takes to give coal more luster is a crisis in the Middle East. With the embargo against Iraq and Kuwait cutting off about a fifth of the world's oil supplies, coal demand can only increase. But even before the recent jump in oil prices, the United States coal industry was growing enough in both size and efficiency to make healthy profits. And coal reserves are vast: if the nation derived all of its energy from one domestic source, crude oil would last eight years, coal 100 years. The United States now imports as much oil as it produces, but exports about 10 percent of its coal.</p>
        <p>United States coal production this year is likely to exceed one billion tons for the first time, the fourth consecutive annual record. Domestic demand has been growing 2 percent annually - about as fast as the economy, but faster than demand for oil or natural gas. Still, coal prices have remained flat, at about $25 a ton, since the early 1980's because companies have plenty of extra capacity. Industry analysts say prices now depend as much on the economy as on events in the gulf. ''As long as the economy continues to grow, I expect prices to go up this fall and winter, for the first time in a long time,'' said Scott Jones, an energy analyst with AUS Consultants of Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>Until the 1940's, coal was the nation's leading industrial fuel, for everything from railroads to home heating. By the 1960's, trains ran on diesel fuel, but the the electric utilities had emerged as major customers. Utilities now use 77 percent of the nation's coal.</p>
        <p>One major threat to the industry comes from pending clean-air legislation. Producers are competing to buy mines and mining rights for cleaner-burning, low-sulfur coal.</p>
        <p>Coal is classified by hardness, moisture and the amount of energy it produces. Bituminous, the most common, is a soft coal used by electric companies and steelmakers. The metallurgical coal that steel mills turn into coke is a grade of bituminous that contains fewer impurities and produces less ash.</p>
        <p>The hardest coal, anthracite, is almost pure carbon. About four million tons a year are consumed in the United States, mostly for heating. Lignite, the softest coal, accounts for a tenth of domestic production.</p>
        <p>The Producers</p>
        <p>Fighting Pollution, Hoping for Exports</p>
        <p>The coal industry is far more fragmented than the nation's oil industry. There are more than 1,000 mining companies, some independent, some subsidiaries of large oil companies that entered the market in the late 1970's.</p>
        <p>The largest producer, the Peabody Coal Company, a unit of the Peabody Holding Company, was purchased by Hanson P.L.C. of Britain in June for $1.25 billion. Peabody produced 9 percent, or 86.7 million tons, of the nation's coal in 1989, according to the National Coal Association. Next came the Consolidation Coal Company, owned by E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company, with 52.5 million tons, and Amax Coal Industries Inc., with 38.1 million tons.</p>
        <p>Peabody has been less profitable than many of its major competitors because its mines are less efficient, analysts say. They expect Peabody's modernization - $129 million for capital improvements last year, up 36 percent over 1988 - to improve profits and shift its production toward low-sulfur coal. Low-sulfur coal, which is less polluting, is deeper in the ground and more expensive to mine than coal with higher sulfur, which can be shoveled from open pits. But new technology has enabled coal companies to get 15 to 20 percent more coal out of underground mines each hour with half the workers. Peabody has bought machines that haul coal from underground mines on conveyor belts rather than by trucks.</p>
        <p>Exports of coal in 1989 reached 105 million tons, the third-highest total after a 1981 peak of 112.5 million and more than a tenth of domestic production. How much higher exports go this year depends on oil. ''If the price of oil stays higher than $25 a barrel, I would expect that there would be a moderate increase in demand overseas, as Europe and Japan switch back to coal electricity,'' said Daniel Roling, a coal analyst with Merrill Lynch.</p>
        <p>The United States, with 35.1 percent of the world's proven, recoverable coal reserves, would be the main beneficiary of higher demand. The Soviet Union has 26.8 percent, followed by South Africa, with 9.1 percent.</p>
        <p>The Steel Market</p>
        <p>New Technologies Promise Efficiency</p>
        <p>The United States steel industry buys 4 percent of the nation's coal. But here and abroad, steel mills have been using less. Last year, demand for metallurgical coal amounted to 38 million tons, down from 67 million tons in 1980. Economists predict that environmental legislation and lower steel production will cut the nation's production of metallurgical coal by an additional 4 million to 5 million tons by the end of the decade.</p>
        <p>The world's steel companies are working on ways to produce steel with much less coal and less air pollution. Steelmaking is now very energy-intensive. Coal is heated in a tall, narrow oven sealed to keep out oxygen. The heating drives out chemical byproducts, primarily benzene, and produces red-hot coke, nearly all carbon, that burns more efficiently and at a far higher temperature than coal. Pollution comes from gases - primarily benzene and ammonia - that escape during the coke-making process.</p>
        <p>The American Iron and Steel Institute, a trade association, is working on so-called direct steelmaking, which requires no coke and less coal, or in some cases none. Some methods burn coal instead of coke, while others rely on electricity. European and Japanese steelmakers also are working on these technologies. ''Over the next 5 to 10 years, steelmakers will need far less coal than they do now,'' said John Jacobson, an analyst with AUS Consultants of Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>The Unions</p>
        <p>Still Wedded to The Wildcat Strike</p>
        <p>The coal industry continues to have some of the nation's most bitter, violent strikes. A 10-month strike by 1,600 members of the United Mine Workers against the Pittston Corporation that ended in February touched off wildcat strikes involving 27,000 other miners. More than 3,000 miners were arrested. Pittston, which is based in Greenwich, Conn., had insisted that reduced employee benefits and more flexible work schedules were necessary to survive in an increasingly competitive industry. Members of the United Mine Workers complained that they had been without a contract since February 1988 and said the company's demands would destroy the union and its gains from earlier strikes.</p>
        <p>Sympathy strikes cost other coal companies hundreds of thousands of dollars a day. To some, the strike signaled new militancy in a union that once could cripple the nation's coal producers and many other industries. Pittston's new four-year contract provided raises of about $1.20 an hour over three years, to a minimum of $15.12, and full coverage of medical expenses for employees, pensioners and families. In return, Pittston won the right to schedule 24-hour production.</p>
        <p>Since the Pittston strike, labor relations have calmed down, with no further strikes. ''This is similar to the thawing out in a turbulent period in a marriage,'' said William H. Miernyk, professor emeritus at West Virginia University School of Business. ''Both sides realize that after the fight you have to live together.''</p>
        <p>SCRUBBERS AND OTHER DEVICES</p>
        <p>Scrubbers have been the power industry's usual answer to pollution from coal. They are small chemical plants, attached to power plants, that reduce sulfur emissions from the burning of coal. The scrubbers include electrically charged filters that trap pollutants. But since the scrubbers cost an average of $100 million, with a 5 percent loss in generating capacity, the search is on for pollution control methods that don't scrub profits as well.</p>
        <p>The pressure to adopt new methods is likely to increase with the passage of tougher air-pollution restrictions now before Congress. Better ways of controlling emissions would also allow power plants to use less expensive higher-sulfur coal. Sulfur emissions from the burning of coal create sulfur dioxide, which causes breathing problems and contributes to acid rain. The Government has already committed $1.3 billion in matching funds to 38 clean-coal projects, and industry experts expect Government outlays to reach $2.5 billion by the end of 1992.</p>
        <p>The most widely tested alternative to scrubbers costs little more than a few tons of limestone. Fluidized bed combustion, as it is called, requires the limestone to be injected into the boilers where coal is being burned. The limestone acts as a chemical sponge, absorbing nearly all of the sulfur emissions.</p>
        <p>But only a few utilities, among them American Electric Power Service of Columbus, Ohio, and the Tennessee Valley Authority, have tested this technique, and only at low levels of power production.</p>
        <p>''It is still a technology that is seen as being risky,'' said Robert C. Porter, a spokesman with the Department of Energy. ''The technology has not yet been widely tested on the scale utilities are accustomed to.''</p>
        <p>Another promising technology converts coal into synthetic gas. Coal particles are broken down, then burned in a gas turbine. When the coal is converted to gas, processes widely used by chemical manufacturers can remove nearly 99 percent of the sulfur. This method, too, is only experimental, Mr. Porter said, with tests at only two plants.</p>
