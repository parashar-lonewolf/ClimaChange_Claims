        <p>Early this morning, as 1,700 diplomats wrangled over final details of a long-embattled climate treaty, environmental campaigners went through a familiar drill.</p>
        <p>''We've already written two statements,'' said David Doniger, the climate policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council.</p>
        <p>Depending on what happened sometime near dawn in the smoke-hazed halls of the Maritim Hotel, they would hand out what they viewed as news of a landmark environmental achievement or a disaster.</p>
        <p>For the second time in eight months, the fate of the Kyoto Protocol, the first treaty to require cuts in gases linked to global warming, came down to a marathon all-night session as countries sought to ensure that the agreement to protect the atmosphere did not harm their economies or other interests.</p>
        <p>The United States remained deeply immersed in the talks, but was on strict orders from the White House not to interfere with other countries' efforts to reach a consensus, even though President Bush rejected the treaty as ''fatally flawed.''</p>
        <p>Dozens of lobbyists for businesses that saw the treaty as either an opportunity or a threat -- ranging from coal companies to sellers of solar power -- also girded for the outcome this morning.</p>
        <p>The protocol would build on an existing climate treaty, signed by Mr. Bush's father in 1992, that called only for voluntary measures to reduce emissions. In subsequent years,  emissions steadily climbed.</p>
        <p>The last session on the Kyoto pact, in The Hague in November, collapsed after the United States and Europe clashed over whether countries should get credit toward emissions goals by planting forests, which absorb carbon dioxide, the dominant greenhouse gas.</p>
        <p>Now, with the United States mainly watching, the pressure has been on Europe and Japan to find a way to resolve any remaining impasses.</p>
        <p>European leaders, facing strong public concern about the issue, had been pushing for a deal in time to ratify the pact by next year, the 10th anniversary of the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, where climate change first became a global issue.</p>
        <p>Japan faced a quandary. It had much face to lose, having been host to the pivotal session in 1997 in the ancient city that gave the protocol its name. But with the United States out of the pact, Japan also now had great leverage in the talks.</p>
        <p>And only with the support of Japan could Europe guarantee, under the complex architecture of the treaty, that the agreement would take effect.</p>
        <p>Late Saturday night, Jan Pronk of the Netherlands, the chairman of the talks, issued a 15-page list of compromises on disputed sections.</p>
        <p>Through Sunday the odds shifted hour by hour, with each side in the greenhouse gas debate spinning every gleaned fact in the direction of either hopeful or doubtful.</p>
        <p>An industry lobbyist who had spent a decade fighting against binding limits on greenhouse gases at climate talks said he was confident that the process would break down.</p>
        <p>''It's too big a load of issues to do it as one package and I'd be surprised if they're going to be able to get anything significant as a partial package,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Early this morning, Mr. Pronk played a high-stakes hand, calling a meeting of all the participating countries. He flatly rejected proposals to achieve formal agreement on everything that had been worked out so far.</p>
        <p>One of the press releases already written by Mr. Doniger's group had predicted this possible outcome, saying it was a good beginning.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Pronk said there would be no partial victory. ''I want to have full agreement,'' he said to the delegations. ''You've committed yourselves not to fail twice.''</p>
        <p>The closed-circuit televisions were shut down, clusters of dark-suited diplomats coursed like corpuscles through the hallways and night moved toward day as the work continued.</p>
