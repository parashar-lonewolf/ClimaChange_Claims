        <p>LEAD: Members of Congress and environmental groups today assailed President Reagan's offer to consider an acid rain treaty with Canada, calling it another tactic to delay enforcing pollution controls on the sources of acid rain.</p>
        <p>Members of Congress and environmental groups today assailed President Reagan's offer to consider an acid rain treaty with Canada, calling it another tactic to delay enforcing pollution controls on the sources of acid rain.</p>
        <p>Several of them contended that Mr. Reagan's offer, added to the end of his speech to the Canadian Parliament on Monday, was largely a political gesture intended to help Canada's conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.</p>
        <p>Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, rejected assertions that there was nothing substantive in the President's offer. At a news briefing today, Mr. Fitzwater said, ''The President's commitment moves us in that direction, in the direction of more action on acid rain.'' Advisory Groups Working</p>
        <p>''What the Canadian Government wanted was a commitment and that's what they got,'' the spokesman added.</p>
        <p>In response to questions, however, Mr. Fitzwater said that the President had agreed only to discuss the possibility of making an agreement but had not committed himself to concluding one. He said that while advisory groups in the State Department and the Domestic Policy Council would take up the issue, no timetable was set for them to report.</p>
        <p>Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Health and the Environment, said that the President's remarks ''did not bring us any closer to an acid rain control program - the rhetoric is just a little smoother.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Waxman said, ''Congress will have to take the leadership in developing legislation that will actually control the pollutants that cause acid rain.'' He said he planned to introduce legislation soon.</p>
        <p>Senator George J. Mitchell, Democrat of Maine, author of one of the bills that would create a national program of acid rain controls, said today that the President's offer ''is more of the same'' lack of direct action and intended ''to appease his friend Brian Mulroney without doing anything substantive.'' Agreement Not 'in Bag'</p>
        <p>The Canadian Government, meanwhile saw the President's iniative as ''a step in the right direction,'' but James Wright, who heads the environmental section of Canada's embassy here, said: ''We don't feel we have an agreement in the bag. We don't want to minimize what the President said but we don't want to build up expectations in Canada or here.''</p>
        <p>Acid rain is air pollution, largely sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide from coal-burning power and industrial plants as well as from motor vehicle engines, that changes in the atmosphere and falls to earth as acidic rain, snow, fog or dust. $2.5 Billion Expenditure Pending legislation, supported by environmental and public health groups, would require controls on power plants and other sources of the pollution to reduce substantially their emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide.</p>
        <p>President Reagan, under the terms of a previous agreement with Canada, has proposed a $2.5 billion Federal expenditure to help develop the means to burn coal cleanly, ut that iniative is also opposed by environmentalists and some members of Congress.</p>
