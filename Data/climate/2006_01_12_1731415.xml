        <p>Israelis Angry at Evangelist's Comment on Sharon  Israel is breaking off talks on a tourism project with the evangelical leader Pat Robertson in response to his remarks suggesting that Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's stroke was divine retribution for pulling out of Gaza. ''God considers this land to be his,'' Mr. Robertson said last week.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for Mr. Robertson said, ''We continue to maintain our longstanding commitment to the Jewish people and the State of Israel.''</p>
        <p>PAGE A16</p>
        <p>Scientists Link Frog Deaths to Global Warming  Scientists studying a fast-dwindling genus of colorful harlequin frogs on mountainsides in Central and South America are reporting that global warming is combining with a fungus to kill off many species.</p>
        <p>PAGE A12</p>
        <p>Anger in New Orleans  Residents of the New Orleans neighborhoods most devastated by flooding after Hurricane Katrina responded with anger after the city's rebuilding commission unveiled its most contentious proposal: giving neighborhoods in low-lying parts of the city four months to a year to prove that their homes should not be bulldozed.</p>
        <p>PAGE A18</p>
        <p>Appeal Could Add Access To Courts for Condemned  An argument before the Supreme Court in a 20-year-old murder case suggested that the court might be willing to open the door a bit wider to death row inmates seeking access to federal court to present plausible but belated claims of innocence.</p>
        <p>Justices Antonin Scalia and Stephen G. Breyer were particularly steeped in the details of the case, debating almost to the exclusion of the lawyers before them.</p>
        <p>PAGE A28</p>
        <p>Challenging Realtors' 6%  The National Association of Realtors is facing growing criticism that it has worked to smother competition and protect the system that provides the traditional 5 percent to 6 percent broker commission on most home sales.</p>
        <p>BUSINESS DAY, PAGE C1</p>
        <p>China's Trade Surplus Triples  China's trade surplus with the rest of the world tripled last year, to a record $102 billion, a figure that could reignite global trade frictions and step up pressure on the government to allow its currency to appreciate further. Economists' concerns were allayed somewhat by figures that showed imports rising and exports falling late in the year. But China's total for the year, $1.4 trillion, moved it past Japan into third place among world traders, behind the United States and Germany.</p>
