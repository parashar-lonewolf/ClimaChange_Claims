        <p>As he clambered onto a steeply pitched roof above this tidy Hessian town -- a coiled-wire brush hanging from a loop of rope on his shoulder -- Dirk Straube offered a few incontrovertible truths about the medieval trade of sweeping chimneys.</p>
        <p>''You can't be afraid of heights,'' said Mr. Straube, who at 6 feet 8 inches tall could get vertigo merely standing on a sidewalk. ''You also can't be afraid of smoke, soot, dust, spider webs or spiders.''</p>
        <p>Creepy, crawling things, he said, are an occupational hazard of venturing into musty attics to get to the roof. Chimney sweeps also risk bee stings and cuts from rusty nails. Snow and ice can turn those picturesque rooftops into a treacherous high-wire act.</p>
        <p>Of all the hazards faced by Germany's plucky chimney sweeps, however, none may be as frightening to them as the prospect of new foreign rivals -- leaping across the border from rooftops in Poland or Portugal.</p>
        <p>That prospect seems more likely after a recent legal challenge by the European Commission to German laws that have shielded chimney sweeps from competition since the Middle Ages.</p>
        <p>''Whenever there is change, you feel nervous,'' Mr. Straube said, fingering the gold buttons on his padded leather coat.</p>
        <p>Few trades are as encrusted with tradition as that of schornsteinfeger, or chimney sweep. Revered as a source of good luck, with their black hats and sooty faces delighting children, chimney sweeps are a link to a vanishing past. They are also, critics say, old-fashioned monopolists.</p>
        <p>Europe has been trying to break open the monopoly since 2003, contending that it violates laws that permit any qualified citizen of a European Union member to set up shop in any other member state. With Germany dragging its heels, the commission recently sent it a legal opinion -- a prelude to taking it to the European Court of Justice.</p>
        <p>''We're not driving through Europe in minibuses to go after chimney sweeps,'' said Oliver Drewes, a spokesman for the European Commission, adding that he recalled the sweeps fondly from his childhood in Germany. ''Most of our cases stem from complaints from citizens.''</p>
        <p>For five years, he said, Germans have been complaining to the European authorities in Brussels about having no choice about who sweeps their chimney, or about the cost. In addition to their sooty brushwork, chimney sweeps inspect heating systems to make sure they are functioning safely -- a obligatory once- or twice-a-year exercise for which they charge between $88 and $113.</p>
        <p>Allowing competition, the thinking in Brussels goes, will improve service and could reduce prices.</p>
        <p>Mr. Straube, 40, whose district south of Frankfurt has 2,000 households, said, ''I have no problem if French chimney sweepers come here, as long as they meet the same quality standards.''</p>
        <p>Listening to him describe his training, it becomes clear that German chimney sweeps view their craft about as modestly as German auto engineers. After earning a license, which took 4 years, Mr. Straube worked as an apprentice for 15 years before taking over his own district.</p>
        <p>Germany is divided into 7,888 districts -- each served by a master chimney sweep and one or two assistants -- and they come to know their bailiwicks like the back of their ash-stained hands.</p>
        <p>In Neu-Isenburg, Mr. Straube handles a mix of single-family houses and small apartment buildings. Most have brick chimneys, which vent exhaust from oil and gas heaters. With the high price of fuel, he said, people are installing wood-burning stoves, which require more cleaning.</p>
        <p>As technology advances, so does the sophistication of the heating systems. In addition to his ladder and brush, Mr. Straube carries a bag filled with equipment that measures carbon dioxide emissions, for environmental reasons, and carbon monoxide emissions, for safety reasons.</p>
        <p>''The job is more and more technical,'' he said, noting that cleaning now occupies less than half his time.</p>
        <p>Still, the rules governing chimney sweeps are less about skills than history, not all of it savory. The monopoly districts were created in 1935 under the Nazi government, which also required that chimney sweeps be German, so they could also be used to snoop around people's homes.</p>
        <p>In 1969, the law was amended to permit non-Germans to be sweeps. But with such a long waiting list for districts -- and a tradition of families passing down the trade -- it remains an overwhelmingly German business.</p>
        <p>Chimney sweeps point out that cities and towns set their rates. While Mr. Straub makes almost $170,000 a year, he must cover his costs and pay trade tax, as well as his assistant and his bookkeeper, who is also his wife. He and others dispute the contention that service would be cheaper with more competitors, except perhaps in border regions.</p>
        <p>''Maybe a Polish chimney sweeper could charge less because he could live in a lower-cost area,'' said Andre Klein, a chimney sweep who handles customer relations for the industry's guild in Berlin.</p>
        <p>Mr. Klein and Mr. Straube expect Germany to be forced to open the market. They hope that the government will keep the district system but make incumbents periodically reapply for their posts, opening it to qualified people from anywhere in the European Union.</p>
        <p>The main reason for preserving the status quo, they say, is the trust between chimney sweeps and their customers. Ninety percent of the people Mr. Straube serves are satisfied with his work, he says, and feel comfortable letting him into their kitchens and bedrooms.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, there are some people who aren't happy,'' he said, stowing a ladder in his truck. ''Maybe they think the service is too expensive. Maybe they want to choose their own chimney sweep.''</p>
        <p>Anna Gebauer, 74, a retiree who lives beneath a chimney cleaned by Mr. Straube, is not among them. She said that she had seen him come and go for years and that she would be unnerved if he were to be replaced by a stranger.</p>
        <p>''You can't let just anybody into your house these days,'' she said. ''It doesn't have to do with people being foreigners or Germans; it has to do with trust.''</p>
