        <p>WHEN 120 countries decided in Berlin last Friday to hold talks for the first time on reducing emissions of heat-trapping industrial waste gases like carbon dioxide, they opened a new and vastly more difficult phase in the world's continuing effort to cope with the uncertain threat of climate change.</p>
        <p>Industrialized countries have been obligated under a treaty signed three years ago at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro to place a ceiling on emissions of the so-called greenhouse gases at 1990 levels by the year 2000. Now, in their first meeting, the parties to the treaty have agreed to undertake negotiations, to be completed within two years, on actual reductions in emissions after 2000.</p>
        <p>The accord to begin talks, known as the Berlin mandate, heartened environmentalists and their governmental allies. "It's a solid agreement," said Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, a senior scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund.</p>
        <p>Scientists advising parties to the treaty say reductions are necessary because the overall concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere would continue to grow at 1990 emission rates. Making the reductions is a very tall order, since the industrialized countries as a group are already having difficulty taking even the modest steps required by the Rio treaty, the long-term objective of which is to prevent dangerous changes in the global climate system.</p>
        <p>The scientists predict that a doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, expected some time in the next century at current rates of emission, would cause the average global temperature to rise by 3 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit. This, they fear, could disrupt the climate system with largely unpredictable but possibly catastrophic consequences.</p>
        <p>Evidence that the world's climate is warming has continued to accumulate since the Rio gathering. But despite some tantalizing and controversial findings that have recently emerged, it is still far from clear whether the rising emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases are responsible for the warming; and if so, whether the warming will have a mild impact or a seriously disruptive one.</p>
        <p>Given this uncertainty and the lack of urgency it fosters, economic and regional divisions are expected to dominate the coming negotiations just as they always have, only more so given the higher stakes: since the burning of coal, oil and natural gas generates carbon dioxide, and the world economy runs on those fossil fuels, future cuts in energy use could exact economic pain. How much of this can be politically tolerated is uncertain at best. Any form of energy tax in the United States, for instance, seems a dead issue for the foreseeable future.</p>
        <p>For poorer countries, the stakes are especially high; they need fossil fuels to develop their economies and raise their standards of living. These countries have steadfastly and so far successfully resisted having specific emission reduction targets and timetables imposed on them. The planned talks on reducing greenhouse gases after the year 2000 will apply only to industrialized countries and the former Soviet bloc, but the door was left open in Berlin for more explicit measures by developing countries after 1997. Environmentalists had feared that the developing countries might close the door, but they did not.</p>
        <p>In fact, the developing countries softened what had been their implacable opposition to allowing rich countries to get credit toward meeting their reduction targets by providing technology or money to help poor countries reduce theirs -- for example, by investing in an energy-efficiency project. Pilot projects in this "joint implementation" arrangement will now be allowed on a voluntary basis, but no credit will be assigned during the pilot phase. Tim Wirth, the Under Secretary of State who headed an American delegation, called this breakthrough Berlin's "signature item."</p>
        <p>Developing countries make essentially a moral argument for requiring more of the richer nations, and sooner. They point out that the richer nations are responsible for most of the carbon dioxide emitted so far and that their emissions per person far outweigh those of third world countries. The United States, for example, is the world's largest source of emissions. As of 1991, the nation's per capita emissions of nearly 20 metric tons a year were almost 10 times those of China.</p>
        <p>But that is expected to change dramatically. China, with its huge coal reserves, could well become the world's largest source of emissions in 25 years, according to a new study by Yale University's Center for Environmental Law and Policy. Other developing countries are also expected to increase their share of global emissions, and the United Nations projects that without further controls, they will far surpass the richer nations' combined total some time in the next century.</p>
        <p>The Yale study "shows that the impacts from the developing countries can no longer be ignored as they have been to date and were at Rio," said Daniel C. Esty, the director of the Yale center and a former Environmental Protection Agency official who was a member of the American negotiating team when the climate treaty was forged.</p>
        <p>Representatives of fossil fuel and related industries, whose clients in the rich countries stand to benefit if the responsibility for reducing emissions is spread more widely, have long argued for including the developing countries. They were not thrilled at the outcome in Berlin.</p>
        <p>The agreement reached there "gives the developing countries like China, India and Mexico a free ride," said John Shlaes, executive director of the Global Climate Coalition, an industry group. "Without substantial commitments by these emerging large emitters of greenhouse gases, there can be no meaningful climate treaty," he said.</p>
        <p>The United States, which has taken a moderate and deliberate position on what to do about emissions after 2000, has been roundly criticized by environmentalists for what they see as a lack of leadership on the question. After Berlin, Mr. Wirth quipped, "We can come back and say, 'Ich bin ein reducer.' "</p>
        <p>Behind everything lurks the uncertainty about what is really happening to the global climate. Scientists generally agree there is little doubt that the world is warming. The average global temperature increased by about one degree Fahrenheit in the last century, and the rise has become steeper in the last two decades. After a two-year hiatus brought about by the cooling effects of the volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991, the global average in 1994 again approached the record high of 1990, just as scientists had predicted. The trend continued in the first two months of 1995. Rising temperatures of sea surfaces and an increase in atmospheric water vapor, expected in a warming world, have also been reported lately.</p>
        <p>But whether the warming results from rising greenhouse-gas emissions is an open question. As the Berlin meeting approached, the German Government reported that a computer modeling study by the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg had found a 95 percent probability that the warming had been caused by greenhouse gases. And the British delegation in Berlin circulated a similar study by that country's meteorological office which, the delegation said, "must add to our confidence" that the warming has been caused by humans at least in part.</p>
        <p>The two studies got wide attention, but specialists in detecting the greenhouse signal amid the noise of the climate's natural variability expressed skepticism, noting among other things that the two studies had not yet been reviewed by outside scientists for publication in scientific journals.</p>
        <p>And Dr. David J. Thomson, a mathematician at AT&amp;T Bell Labs in Murray Hill, N.J., reported in the current issue of the journal Science that on the basis of statistical studies of the earth's annual cycle, it appeared that variation in the sun's energy output "is at most a minor factor in the increase in average temperature observed over the last century." He also found that the degree of variation between the seasons had lessened in recent decades, an effect predicted by computer models in the event of greenhouse warming.</p>
        <p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the group of scientists advising the signers of the treaty, is reassessing the state of knowledge about global warming and plans to issue a report later this year. The climate treaty was designed to allow leeway for new action in the light of advancing scientific knowledge. So while the coming negotiations pose a new order of difficulty, they can shift into a higher gear at any time if scientists turn up clear evidence that humans are indeed changing the climate.</p>
