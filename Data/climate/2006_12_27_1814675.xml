        <p>The unseasonably warm weather, which has caused confusion, frustration and outfit modifications across the city and much of the Northeast in recent weeks, was particularly troublesome to workers at the Bronx Zoo yesterday afternoon. As temperatures hovered in the 50s, the balmy weather was threatening to create a new kind of endangered species.</p>
        <p>A seven-foot-tall giraffe was dripping at the chin. A chimp hanging from a ledge was vanishing, one drop at a time. They were both part of a display of 100 ice sculptures unveiled last night in the zoo's Holiday Lights event. Pete Lanzilotta, 57, who works for Ice Sculpture Designs of Deer Park, N.Y., which created the figures, didn't need to wear a coat as he unloaded ice butterflies from the back of a van.</p>

        <p>The unseasonably warm weather, which has caused confusion, frustration and outfit modifications across the city and much of the Northeast in recent weeks, was particularly troublesome to workers at the Bronx Zoo yesterday afternoon. As temperatures hovered in the 50s, the balmy weather was threatening to create a new kind of endangered species.</p>
        <p>A seven-foot-tall giraffe was dripping at the chin. A chimp hanging from a ledge was vanishing, one drop at a time. They were both part of a display of 100 ice sculptures unveiled last night in the zoo's Holiday Lights event. Pete Lanzilotta, 57, who works for Ice Sculpture Designs of Deer Park, N.Y., which created the figures, didn't need to wear a coat as he unloaded ice butterflies from the back of a van.</p>
        <p>''When you work in and out of freezers all day, this is summertime,'' Mr. Lanzilotta said. ''We haven't even had to wear long johns yet.''</p>
        <p>For the brave, tank tops and long shorts sufficed. For the more timid -- some would say sensible -- jackets, gloves and scarves were still in order, as a gusty wind kept conditions cool. But not cool enough. Justin Alito, 14, of Long Island has a brand new snowboard that has not touched snow. A salesman at Tarzian Hardware in Park Slope, Brooklyn, said he had snow shovels left over from last year, and a shelf full of heaters.</p>
        <p>''Personally, I'd like to live in South Beach,'' said the store's sales clerk, Sameer Tayeh, 21. ''But for work, I'd like it to be cold. It means business. It means livelihoods.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, New Yorkers have been coping with a new condition this month.</p>
        <p>Being balmy.</p>
        <p>Balmy typically means good things: soothing, mild, pleasant. Yet the word has taken on a more negative connotation lately. People worried that the cause of such a mild December was global warming, and yesterday the joys of wearing short sleeves were tempered with the anxiety of environmental disaster.</p>
        <p>''It's short-term pleasure, long-term pain,'' said David Rothman, 40, an English professor at Queensborough Community College whose temporary pleasure was treating his 3-year-old daughter to ice cream in Jackson Heights.</p>
        <p>The average temperature this month has been 44 degrees, 6 degrees above normal for this time of year, the National Weather Service said. On Dec. 2, the mercury climbed to 70 degrees in Central Park, a record high for the day. And New Yorkers haven't seen measurable snowfall in the city in 265 days. The date was April 5, and a meager tenth of an inch fell.</p>
        <p>Joe Pollina, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Upton, N.Y., said it was hard to say when it would start to feel like winter in the city. The week's forecast is partly cloudy, with a high in the low 40s today and high 40s tomorrow.</p>
        <p>''A lot of the systems that have been coming through the area have been from the Pacific Ocean,'' Mr. Pollina said, ''which is warmer than the Canadian air that we would need to see come through for colder air. We're just not able to tap into the cold air from up north.''</p>
        <p>Not everyone misses the cold -- or the snow. Juan Ortiz, 47, was doing sprints yesterday at McCarren Park in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, training for an approaching race in Central Park. He ran around the track barefoot and shirtless.</p>
        <p>''People like to romanticize the snow,'' he said. ''Look, the snow gets dirty. You have to wear the big heavy coat. Because of evolution, we have adapted to the snow. The big heavy coat, taking hours to get ready, 20 pounds of clothes. It's nothing desirable.''</p>
        <p>There is indeed a place in the city where it feels like winter, where it always feels like winter. If you don't mind the smell, that is. In the Bronx, in the new, indoor Fulton Fish Market, the country's largest seafood distribution center, the climate-controlled temperature hovers between 40 and 45 degrees. It's good for the fish. And it makes it easy for the fishmongers to dress in the morning.</p>
        <p>''You know exactly how many layers,'' explained Warren D. Kremin, the president of Fathers Fish Company, ''because you know exactly how cold it is.''</p>
