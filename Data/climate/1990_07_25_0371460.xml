        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''White House Gases'' (editorial, July 11) is on target in stating that ''sensible precautions'' can be taken now to address the global climate-change issue. But the editorial fails to mention a key component in the search for options to address this issue: electricity.</p>
        <p>Electricity is moving our country toward greater energy efficiency and consequently is reducing energy-related emissions. From 1983 to 1989, overall energy demand increased 9 percent, while electricity use grew more than 50 percent. A study conducted for Edison Electric Institute found that electrification in the transportation and industrial sectors can reduce carbon dioxide emissions significantly. In fact, electric applications can decrease CO#2 emissions in industrial processes and in the transportation sector by 17 percent and 8 percent, respectively.</p>
        <p>In addition, electric utilities are spending more than $1 billion annually on energy-efficiency programs. Demand-side management programs have resulted in an estimated deferral of 21,000 megawatts of new capacity (42 medium-size power plants), and will result in deferring a total of 45,000 megawatts by the year 2000. Energy-efficiency gains can also be achieved when generating electricity. These efficiencies are achieved not only through new technologies like clean coal plants, but also through retooling existing plants.</p>
        <p>But energy taxes could dramatically change the efficiency story. These taxes could add $12 billion per year to the already high price tag footed by electricity consumers for environmental protection. There is no fairness in a tax that would hit low-income households the hardest, affect heavily industrialized states disproportionately, and severely hamper our economic competitiveness in world markets.</p>
        <p>As a country we must continue to press for energy efficiency in the residential, industrial, commercial and transportation sectors. The environmental benefits of an energy tax, however, are questionable. As we grapple with options to address future environmental concerns, we should not be adding taxes that will keep electricity from being part of the solution.</p>
