        <p>The European Union's 15 environment ministers agreed that their countries would be bound by the Kyoto Protocol, the treaty that seeks to cut the pollution blamed for global warming. Formal ratification of the pact -- which commits the union to reduce emissions of ''greenhouse gases'' by 8 percent of 1990 levels during the five-year period from 2008 through 2012 -- now goes to the European Council of heads of state and government, which could act as early as this month at the union summit in Barcelona.</p>
