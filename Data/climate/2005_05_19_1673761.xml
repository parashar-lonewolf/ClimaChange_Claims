        <p>In keeping with Gov. George E. Pataki's commitment to follow California's tough auto emissions standards, state environmental officials released a set of proposed regulations yesterday that would reduce the amount of carbon dioxide and other pollutants released by cars and light trucks sold in New York. New York adopted California's vehicle emissions program in the early 1990's, and has continued to follow them as they have become more stringent. Manufacturers will have several options for making their vehicles run cleaner, including six-speed transmissions and more efficient air-conditioning controls. The new standards will be carried out with the 2009 model. Hearings on the proposed regulations are scheduled to begin on July 5.</p>
