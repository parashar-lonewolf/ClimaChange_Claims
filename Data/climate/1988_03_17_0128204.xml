        <p>LEAD: An engine fire broke out today on the Scandinavian Star, leaving the cruise ship adrift for hours in the Gulf of Mexico with more than 700 people aboard, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>An engine fire broke out today on the Scandinavian Star, leaving the cruise ship adrift for hours in the Gulf of Mexico with more than 700 people aboard, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>No injuries were reported directly from the fire, which was reported to be out, but an unidentified 71-year-old male passenger suffered what was believed to be a heart attack. A helicopter was dispatched from Homestead Air Force Base, near Miami, to take the man to a hospital.</p>
        <p>''The fire is out and the ship is being towed by the Mexican navy to Cancun,'' said Chief Petty Officer Luis Diaz of the Coast Guard in Miami. The cutter Vigilance was escorting the ship as a precaution, he said.</p>
        <p>The 465-foot Scandinavian Star was about 35 miles off Isla Mujeres, a Mexican island north of the tourist resort of Cancun in the Yucatan Peninsula, the Coast Guard said.</p>
        <p>Although the fire, which broke out about 1 A.M., was under control, the Coast Guard said that the engine room had been sealed off and carbon dioxide pumped into it, and that the ship was dead in the water. Mexican vessels arrived about four hours after the fire began.</p>
        <p>The cruise ship Canada Star and another vessel, the Vera Cruz I, were standing by to help. ''In the event that the fire breaks out again and that passengers have to evacuate the vessel, we will be there to assist and take the passengers,'' said the Canada Star's captain, Jens Thorn.</p>
        <p>There were 449 passengers and 266 crew members abord, according to the ship's owner, Miami-based SeaEscape Ltd.</p>
        <p>The ship should arrive in Cancun by early Thursday, Mr. Diaz said.</p>
        <p>Jill DeChello, a spokeswoman for SeaEscape, said the passengers would then be flown to St. Petersburg. The ship was returning to St. Petersburg after a three-day, four-night cruise to Cozumel, south of Cancun, when the fire broke out, she said, adding officials were not sure what caused it.</p>
