        <p>A FEW rules to keep in mind when interviewing Robert A. Lutz, the vice chairman of General Motors.</p>
        <p>Do not conduct the interview in an Australian muscle car. If you do, do not let him drive. If he is driving, bring a tape recorder, because handwritten notes will resemble seismograph readings, like 7 on the Richter scale. Most important: eat light, keep your eyes focused on the horizon and make sure your will is in order.</p>
        <p>''A hundred miles an hour is really a cinch in this thing!'' This is Mr. Lutz, 70, speaking, stogie in pocket, aviator glasses on, during a recent slalom around narrow back roads and blind turns in the hilly wine country here, breaking free from the worldwide product review that G.M. is conducting in this city. The reporter next to him is frantically peering over Mr. Lutz's shoulder trying to convert kilometers-per-hour (110-130-150) into miles-per-hour (68.4-80.8-93.2).</p>
        <p>Larger than life, Mr. Lutz returned to G.M. a year ago last month after a three-decade hiatus. His current titles, in full, are vice chairman of product development at the General Motors Corporation and chairman of G.M. North America, making him one of the most powerful executives under the chief executive, G. Richard Wagoner Jr.</p>
        <p>To environmentalists, he is an unreconstructed champion of fossil fuel. Ask him and he will readily share his view of global warming as bunk. He is a central architect of America's sport-utility-vehicle craze, having played pivotal roles in creating the Explorer while he was a director of the Ford Motor Company and in making the S.U.V. luxurious with the Jeep Grand Cherokee while he was president of the Chrysler Corporation. He is also a strong advocate of G.M.'s effort to turn the Hummer, a line of S.U.V.'s based on the Humvee military transport, into a mass-market brand.</p>
        <p>To car aficionados, Mr. Lutz is a revered figure, Motor City's irascible elder uncle. To them, his latest mission is a holy errand, to restore a sense of style to a company whose products, like the 1963 Corvette Stingray, once crackled with personality but turned so bland by the early 90's that different sedans -- Buick, Oldsmobile or Pontiac -- were largely indistinguishable.</p>
        <p>So, has Mr. Lutz helped G.M. regain its mojo?</p>
        <p>A year is a short time in the auto business, but Mr. Lutz's fingerprints are already visible as he tries to invigorate the company's passenger cars. To start, he is bringing back the Pontiac GTO -- known as the Goat and last sold in the 70's -- by tapping the company's Australian unit, Holden. The reborn GTO, now the Holden Monaro, has rear-wheel drive, an important characteristic of classic muscle cars; it can also be imported cheaply, though the United Automobile Workers restricts how many will be sold.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lutz likes such creativity on a budget, but will spend money on design tweaks that might seem subliminal. The Chevrolet Impala had a thick band of red plastic across its back end that subsumed the taillights. One of Mr. Lutz's first moves was to apply an adhesive strip that covered the plastic and emphasized the lights' fish-eye shapes.</p>
        <p>Another nuisance, he said, was the front end of the Pontiac Grand Prix, which he approached like an orthodontist. ''It had two very long black openings on the front that came to a point,'' he said. ''Its nickname was the Bucky Beaver Grand Prix.''</p>
        <p>He wants the front of Pontiacs to look more curvy, like the Pontiac Solstice, a svelte, two-seat-roadster prototype he put together for the Detroit auto show in January. He said he wanted a Pontiac to be ''a smallish, exciting, high-performance car that didn't try to be prestigious.''</p>
        <p>''They can't imitate BMW, but they can imitate some of the qualities of BMW, the nice, crisp handling, the predictable, controllable ride, nice precise steering and above average power for its class,'' he said. ''It ought to be a little more refined.''</p>
        <p>Some of G.M.'s favorite design trends he regards as weeds. For one, he has largely done away with cladding, the heavy plastic coating on much of the exterior of vehicles like the Chevrolet Avalanche pickup.</p>
        <p>''It provides visual clutter, almost always, and breaks up the lines of the car,'' he explained. ''For a while, it was considered sporty. These things go in cycles like chrome. Chrome was totally out for the last 15 years, and now chrome is starting to make a big comeback.''</p>
        <p>Chrome he likes, calling it ''jewelry on cars,'' and chrome will be more visible on forthcoming cars.</p>
        <p>As important as the outside, he said, is the inside.</p>
        <p>''It bothers me that people tell me that 'well, I don't care what the quality surveys say, all I have to do is open the door on a Japanese and German car and I'm looking at quality. When I open the door of a General Motors, I'm looking at cheap plastic,' '' he said. ''That bothers me a lot. And it's got nothing to do with how good the car is, how safe the car is, how long it lasts, but it has everything to do with pride of ownership and the appreciation that all of us have for owning a really nice object.''</p>
        <p>He called the interiors of Volkswagen-made cars, including the Audi brand, the best in the industry, but added that their cold Teutonic feel was not one G.M. would want to emulate.</p>
        <p>''What you want to do is get that execution level but with more style,'' Mr. Lutz said. ''Use noble materials, really nice execution, get everything so it fits and nice gloss and grain levels.''</p>
        <p>Such nobility is hard to detect so far, even in the company's luxury vehicles. Mr. Lutz said that within a year or two his push to stylize the rank-and-file interiors would show fruit, and he was particularly enthusiastic about the redesigned 2004 Grand Prix.</p>
        <p>More than anything, Mr. Lutz is shifting G.M.'s culture.</p>
        <p>''I encourage dissent,'' he said, adding that a ''cultural defect,'' in which employees had avoided criticizing the company, had existed before his arrival. He cited the Aztek, an awkwardly pubescent cross between a car and an S.U.V. Some people, he said, ''voiced doubts that the Aztek was the right thing to do.''</p>
        <p>''They were taken to the woodshed and told, 'Listen, a failure to support the Aztek is tantamount to corporate disloyalty.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lutz also wants the cars to reconnect with a sense of art. At a recent product review, he appeared with Nicola Bulgari, the jeweler, and Mark Rydell, the director of ''On Golden Pond,'' to discuss how to evoke emotions in cars, movies and jewels.</p>
        <p>Such a discussion would not have happened in the infamously bureaucratic G.M. of the recent past. At a conference in August, Mr. Lutz told a story about a car-magazine editor who gave a talk to G.M. executives several years ago. The editor later received a letter prepared by G.M.'s Outside Speaker Effectiveness Evaluation and Analysis Group, which rated speakers on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 being the best.</p>
        <p>''The five non-G.M. speakers had individual scores ranging from 0 to 10,'' the letter read. ''Yours ranged from 3 to 10. The five outside speakers' average scores ranged from 5.25 to 8.25. Your average was 7.35.''</p>
        <p>The analysis went on. ''Two speakers had average scores higher than yours. Two were ranked lower than you. Your standard deviation from the mean was 1.719, and ranked second among the variances, showing that most people had a similar opinion about your remarks.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lutz paused. ''I'd say that might be an example of G.M. being overly analytical.''</p>
        <p>''Thank heaven we've changed our ways,'' he said. ''Now, if someone comes in and talks to us, when they finish we just look at each other and say, 'That was great,' or 'Boy, that was a turkey.' ''</p>
