        <p>Representative John D. Dingell plans to introduce a bill that would encourage the sale of diesel cars in the United States, a prospect strongly supported by the auto industry but opposed by environmental groups.</p>
        <p>Industry executives have said in recent years that modern diesel engines are far less dirty and noisy than those of the 1970's and offer a relatively easy way to improve fuel economy and reduce global-warming emissions.</p>
        <p>That argument has carried weight in Europe, where about one-third of light-duty vehicles sold each year are powered by diesel engines. But regulations in the United States have restricted diesel engines -- they are in fewer than 1 percent of new light-duty vehicles -- and Volkswagen is the only company selling diesel passenger cars here.</p>
        <p>Robert A. Lutz, the vice chairman of General Motors, said at an auto industry conference last month, ''We should get diesels in the mix because it's one way we could get 10 to 15 percent fuel economy improvement while keeping the size mix that we have.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who recently won a rare and hard-fought Democratic primary election, is the longest-serving member of the House and a staunch ally of the Big Three automakers. His spokeswoman on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Laura Sheehan, said that the bill was still being drafted but that ''the goal of the legislation would be to enable this technology to have widespread clean-diesel usage.''</p>
        <p>She said it would involve tax credits for oil companies that produced diesel fuel with low sulfur content and possibly some incentives for the auto industry. The industry has previously lobbied for tax credits for consumers who buy cars with advanced diesel engines. Mr. Dingell's plan was reported today in The Detroit News.</p>
        <p>Diesels can be a third more fuel-efficient than a comparable gasoline-powered car. They can also cut emissions of carbon dioxide, linked by some scientists to global climate change, because such emissions are tied to fuel economy. Allen Schaeffer, executive director of the Diesel Tech Forum, a trade group that includes G.M. and diesel engine makers, said: ''We have concerns about fuel economy and carbon dioxide. Diesel can provide ready-made solutions for both of those.''</p>
        <p>But diesel engines also have much higher emissions of particulates, or soot -- which can worsen asthma, according to some studies, and lead to cancer. They also emit more nitrogen oxide, a contributor to smog.</p>
        <p>A new set of regulations related to the Clean Air Act will restrict these emissions, but even the new rules will allow diesel engines to emit more than twice the quantity of particulates of a gasoline-powered engine. The biggest challenge for the industry, though, will be developing a way to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide.</p>
        <p>Environmental groups in this country oppose the wider use of diesel-powered vehicles. One prominent group, the Union of Concerned Scientists, is preparing a report expressing skepticism about improvements made in diesel technology. The report also contends that diesels emit 40 chemical compounds that lead to various cancers, birth defects and other health problems.</p>
        <p>''We remain to be convinced,'' said Michelle Robinson, a senior advocate with the group, adding, ''In terms of cancer risk and immune-system disorders, diesel is far and away more problematic than gasoline exhaust.''</p>
        <p>European standards are not so strict on emissions from diesel engines, and environmentalists in Europe have not been as strongly opposed.</p>
        <p>''Our colleagues in Europe have not been as concerned with smog-forming pollutants,'' said Daniel Becker of the Sierra Club.</p>
        <p>''They are just as concerned as we are about global warming, but they are willing to make trade-offs we are not willing to make.''</p>
        <p>And not all automakers seem eager to push to bring the technology here.</p>
        <p>''We do get customers at our dealerships asking for hybrids, we don't get customers asking for diesels,'' said Ben Knight, vice president for automotive engineering at Honda R&amp;D Americas, referring to cars with hybrid engines that combine gasoline and electric power. ''They are intrigued by the superclean, superefficient gasoline hybrid with a fuel that's available.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Becker of the Sierra Club added that hybrid cars offered a technology that could also provide greater fuel efficiency without increased particulate or nitrogen oxide emissions.</p>
        <p>Diesel also has a high sulfur content, and regulations in Europe and the United States will require that to be reduced later in the decade, a move supported by the industry.</p>
        <p>''Sulfur does nothing good for fuel,'' said Greg Dana, vice president for environmental affairs at the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, an industry trade group. ''It's simply a poison to catalysts and all the advanced control technologies in cars.''</p>
