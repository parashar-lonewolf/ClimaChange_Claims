        <p>LEAD: OF all the Christmas gifts exchanged on Capitol Hill last month, few attracted more interest than the biodegradable plastic bags Senator Tom Harkin included in the baskets of Iowa farm products that he delivered to colleagues. The bags, which are designed to decompose after a year or two, are at the head of a growing list of industrial products made with corn, the nation's largest and most important crop.</p>
        <p>OF all the Christmas gifts exchanged on Capitol Hill last month, few attracted more interest than the biodegradable plastic bags Senator Tom Harkin included in the baskets of Iowa farm products that he delivered to colleagues. The bags, which are designed to decompose after a year or two, are at the head of a growing list of industrial products made with corn, the nation's largest and most important crop.</p>
        <p>Across the country, laboratories and factories are grinding, processing and shaping corn into a wide variety of products that include water-absorbent filters, de-icing materials to replace road salt, molded plastics, chemical additives and adhesives. The corn-based products, representing a rare combination of ingenuity and foresight, could signal the start of an important economic transition for American agriculture.</p>
        <p>Developing new products from corn, soybeans, cotton and other crops could reduce surpluses, raise farm income and bring down the cost of the Government's agricultural subsidies, which have reached almost $50 billion over the last two years. By making more goods from biodegradable farm products instead of from petroleum-based plastics, the nation could lower its oil import bills, shrink city garbage piles and reduce pollution.</p>
        <p>The notion of using crops for things other than food and fiber is as old as agriculture. Cotton lint is used in the manufacture of some explosives. Tobacco is ground up to make a natural insecticide. Casein, a milk protein, is an ingredient in many adhesives. Last year, 340 million bushels of corn, almost 5 percent of the harvest, was turned into ethanol fuel.</p>
        <p>Despite these successes, the number of products made from crops is still surprisingly small. Researchers have focused on developing larger yields, not alternative uses. And it has been easier to make commercial products from other materials, particularly petrochemicals.</p>
        <p>But the momentum of the oil age may be slowing as lawmakers and the public recognize the economic and social costs of petrochemicals.</p>
        <p>Moreover, a new era of biological development is taking shape as researchers learn to use genetic engineering and other life-transforming technologies to custom design crops. These agricultural inventions are expected to include plants that contain greater quantities of valuable resins, fluids and fibers for industrial uses.</p>
        <p>More than ever before, scientists and lawmakers are talking about new products from old crops, and old products from entirely new kinds of crops. Last year the Senate passed a measure sponsored by Senator Harkin, an Iowa Democrat, that would provide up to $75 million a year for such research. The measure has been attached to a major trade bill under consideration by a House-Senate conference committee.</p>
        <p>''I see a day when new plants will be designed for specific uses,'' Senator Harkin said. ''We will be able to bio-engineer industrial oils, proteins and chemicals. All of this diversification is a necessary precursor to a competitive agricultural system.'' Petroleum Substitute</p>
        <p>Scientists and lawmakers have seized upon corn as a pioneer in this effort because it is the most plentiful, the least expensive and the most versatile of all field crops. Last year American farmers produced 7.1 billion bushels of corn. Scientists believe that virtually anything that can be made from the molecular ribbons of carbon and hydrogen that form petroleum can also be manufactured from corn starch, which consists of long chains of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms. A typical corn kernel is 70 percent starch.</p>
        <p>Last year, according to industry estimates, the United States used almost 1 billion barrels of petroleum -enough to meet the nation's demand for imported oil for five months -just for the manufacture of plastics, 60 billion pounds of them. As technology advances, the same products, scientists believe, could be made from roughly 3 billion bushels of corn. To meet the demand, the nation would have to expand its corn acreage by at least 30 percent. Surpluses would disappear.</p>
        <p>Initially, scientists and manufacturers have concentrated on breaking into the 14 billion-pound-a-year disposable packaging industry with a hybrid product that is part corn starch and part polyethylene. At their plant in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, the Archer Daniels Midland Company manufactures the disposable bag distributed by Senator Harkin.</p>
        <p>In Bement, Ill., the Central Illinois Manufacturing Company has begun making a new generation of filters from corn starch particles called super slurpers. Invented by scientists at the United States Agriculture Department's Northern Regional Research Center in Peoria, the particles absorb 300 times their weight in water. ''Put a quarter of a teaspoon in a cup of coffee and it would turn it all to gel,'' said Will Ayers, the company's president. By impregnating fiberglass mats with the particles, the company makes filters to remove water from oil and gasoline.</p>
        <p>Agri-Tech Industries, a year-old company in Champaign-Urbana, Ill., is blending polyethylene and corn starch to make plastic resins for disposable bottles and other products. Dr. Richard Wool, the company's research director, said the new plastics, which contain up to 40 percent corn starch, are as strong and flexible as pure polyethylene.</p>
        <p>They are also less expensive, and when they are ultimately interred in garbage dumps, they will act more like food than plastic: Bacteria and other microbes will eat the starch molecules, converting them to carbon dioxide. Meanwhile, the polyethylene chains will break apart and be consumed by insects and other organisms. Unlike plastics made entirely of polyethylene, they will not outlast their inventors.</p>
