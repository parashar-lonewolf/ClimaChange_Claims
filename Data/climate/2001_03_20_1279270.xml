        <p>Two months into the Bush administration's term, its foreign policy has still barely taken shape.

''During the cold war there was an overarching agenda for American foreign policy -- containment of the Soviet Union -- that was easily handed off from one administration to another,'' notes President Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger.

        <p>Two months into the Bush administration's term, its foreign policy has still barely taken shape. In part this is because many of the administration's key sub-cabinet officials are still not in place to grind out its new policies. But don't be fooled by that. It's also because three major fault lines run through the prospective Bush foreign policy. Pay attention to these fault lines. They could widen into chasms very soon.</p>
        <p>The first fault line is between the old, but still ongoing, policies of the Clinton administration and the instincts of President Bush, which run counter to many of these inherited policies. ''During the cold war there was an overarching agenda for American foreign policy -- containment of the Soviet Union -- that was easily handed off from one administration to another,'' notes President Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger. But with the cold war now over, and administrations now much freer to engage in interventions of choice -- whether Iraq, Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Kosovo, Rwanda, Middle East peace or Colombia -- ''foreign policy no longer conveys with the White House,'' says Mr. Berger.</p>
        <p>So Mr. Bush feels no real allegiance to the open-ended Clinton nation-building in Bosnia and Kosovo; he wants to ratchet up the pressure on Saddam Hussein, rather than adopt the Clinton strategy of ignore and contain; and he spurned the Clinton attempt to negotiate an end to North Korea's missile exports.</p>
        <p>Watch out. When an administration inherits a series of policies it does not favor but where U.S. troops or diplomats are already committed in the field, there is a tendency to see only the risks in these policies and none of the potential rewards. And therefore there is a tendency not to finish the job, so the risks linger and fester and you end up with the worst of all worlds -- a policy you can't get rid of but don't have the will to succeed at (Bosnia, Kosovo?).</p>
        <p>Look at the crisis in Macedonia. Right now you have Albanian rebels coming out of Kosovo trying to put together a ''Greater Albania.'' To that end they are infiltrating and destabilizing the democratically elected government of Macedonia, which has an Albanian minority. NATO, which has 37,000 troops in Kosovo, should be forcing these Albanian extremists -- in no uncertain terms -- to halt their attacks on Macedonia. But the Bush team, which just wants to get out of Kosovo as quickly as possible, doesn't want to get more involved.</p>
        <p>The second important fault line is the one within the Republican Party. The Democratic Party, historically, has been divided on one major foreign policy issue, trade. The Republicans, by contrast, are divided on virtually every foreign policy issue, including trade. Because they have been out of power since the cold war ended, the Republicans never resolved their internal differences. During the Clinton years they just criticized the president, and during the campaign they papered over their differences. People think that once the Bush team gets all its sub-cabinet officials in place that it will start producing coherent policies. That's actually funny! When the staffs are in place is when the real fights will start. The Republicans are going to fight out inside the Bush administration all the post-cold-war foreign policy issues they avoided formulating coherent positions on when they were out of power.</p>
        <p>On China, Republican ideologues want to contain and punish Beijing, and G.O.P. business types want to do business there like there's no tomorrow. On Bosnia and Kosovo, isolationist Republicans don't want to stay another day, and G.O.P. idealists believe America has moral obligation to build democracy there. On North Korea, Republican realists want to do a missile deal, and the anti-Communists want to see the North Korean evil empire collapse, just like the Soviet empire, even if it provokes a violent mess.</p>
        <p>The third major fault line is between the Bushies and America's allies. Mr. Bush came in boasting that he would manage the allies so much better than the Clintonites did. But so far he has embarrassed Kim Dae Jung of South Korea and unnerved the Europeans on issues from climate change to national missile defense.</p>
        <p>As I said, all of these fault lines were apparent in the Republican Party, but because it was not in power, it never had to resolve them -- and it didn't. Well, vacation's over. So beware: chasms ahead.</p>
