        <p>Flush with billions of dollars from its capital campaign and a flourishing endowment, Harvard University plans to pump as much as $200 million over the next five years into new science programs, including a new center on the sizzling field of genes and how they work, a Harvard dean said today.</p>
        <p>The dean, Jeremy R. Knowles of the school of arts and sciences, said the money would go to found at least two new centers, one on genomics and the other to investigate the region that lies between quantum physics and classical physics. Work at that mesoscale may provide a window for looking into living cells and for developing new materials, computing devices and drugs.</p>

        <p>Flush with billions of dollars from its capital campaign and a flourishing endowment, Harvard University plans to pump as much as $200 million over the next five years into new science programs, including a new center on the sizzling field of genes and how they work, a Harvard dean said today.</p>
        <p>The dean, Jeremy R. Knowles of the school of arts and sciences, said the money would go to found at least two new centers, one on genomics and the other to investigate the region that lies between quantum physics and classical physics. Work at that mesoscale may provide a window for looking into living cells and for developing new materials, computing devices and drugs.</p>
        <p>The money may also go toward programs on the link between the brain's physiology and behavior, on the development of scientific search engines for the World Wide Web and on climate change, among others.</p>
        <p>''These are areas that, my God, they're important for society, for education,'' Dean Knowles said.</p>
        <p>On gene study, several other institutions had already come to the same conclusion. The California Institute of Technology began work two years ago on a new center and has raised about $60 million of its $100 million goal, said Dr. Melvin Simon, biology chairman at Caltech.</p>
        <p>At Princeton, the capital campaign includes a target of $60 million to support its nascent Institute for Genomic Analysis, and the institute announced the appointment of its first director, Dr. Shirley M. Tilghman, this month.</p>
        <p>Stanford, with two genome centers, and the University of California, among others, are considered leaders in genomics.</p>
        <p>''A number of very distinguished institutions are embarking on analogous areas,'' Dean Knowles said, ''so there is a sense for me in which we can't afford not to do this.''</p>
        <p>The need for new genomics centers arises from the flood of information issuing from the monumental work under way to decipher the full sets of genes of organisms from bacteria to man. That mapping is only the beginning; scientists must somehow take such genomes and give them meaning, explain how they translate into disease or behavior or physical form.</p>
        <p>''Most of the genome projects now focus on cataloguing the genes and describing their structure,'' Dr. Simon said. ''The big problem facing the 21st century is to find out what the genes do.''</p>
        <p>Or as Dr. Tilghman put it when her appointment was announced, scientists with genetic blueprints in hand are now beginning to study ''how the component parts are assembled into the whole.''</p>
        <p>To do that, biologists need help from colleagues in a variety of fields, like engineering (for the robots that make chips), chemistry (for items like fluorescent molecules for labeling) and biochemistry (for the isolation of genes and proteins). Dean Knowles, like his counterparts at other universities, decided that such collaboration required a building to bring scientists together, and he said he concluded that the usual model, where a single professor founds a single laboratory to work on a research direction, would not suffice.</p>
        <p>''A lot of the most exciting science often needs facilities that no single investigator can buy or maintain,'' he said, citing electron microscopes that cost more than $1 million.</p>
        <p>Unlike some of its competitors, Harvard these days does not need to raise money to create new centers. The university's endowment is about $13 billion, and the school of arts and sciences, which has more than 6,000 undergraduates and more than 3,000 graduate students, raised about $900 million in the recent capital campaign, Dean Knowles said.</p>
        <p>About $70 million of the new science initiative announced today is already earmarked for various construction, equipment and hiring, Dean Knowles said, adding that Harvard would spend $150 million to $200 million over all.</p>
