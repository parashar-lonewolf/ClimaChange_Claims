        <p>9 P.M. (CBS) 29TH ANNUAL KENNEDY CENTER HONORS -- No wonder they're smiling. Caroline Kennedy is host of this ceremony, taped on Dec. 3, celebrating the lifetime achievements of (from above left) the conductor Zubin Mehta, the director Steven Spielberg, the singers Dolly Parton and Smokey Robinson, and the composer and producer Andrew Lloyd Webber.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (History) LAST DAYS ON EARTH -- Just in time for dire New Year's predictions, a scientific evaluation of the seven deadliest threats to humanity, including black holes, artificial intelligence, supervolcanoes, asteroid strikes, nuclear war, disease and climate change.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Sundance) OFFICE TIGERS -- They call them B.P.O's, for business process outsourcing - the so-called ''back offices'' that American companies open in developing countries where costs are low and ambition is high. This four-part documentary series travels to southern India to capture the lives of the staff at Office Tigers, a multinational business-services company that provides high-end, low-cost support work to the world's top legal firms, investment banks and consultancies.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (NBC) IN THE SHADOW OF THE AMERICAN DREAM -- In this ''Tom Brokaw Reports'' special, Mr. Brokaw (above) travels to the Colorado Rockies between the resort towns of Aspen and Vail, an area that has seen an influx of Hispanics, mostly from Mexico, to explore the realities -- economic, social and political -- surrounding illegal immigration.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (ABC) BIG DAY -- An amply endowed bridesmaid threatens to upstage the bride.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Biography) TOTAL EXCESS: THE ROBBER BARRONS -- A new series devoted to the ways the rich are not like you and me.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (VH1) INSANE CELEBRITY REAL ESTATE '06 -- Because celebrities apparently need large houses to house their large egos.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (HBO) REAL SPORTS WITH BRYANT GUMBEL -- A jockey without medical insurance is the equivalent of a Nascar driver without a seatbelt. Yet, for the men and women who race 1,200-pound thoroughbreds, a helmet is often their only coverage. Tonight, Mr. Gumbel returns to this story, which he first explored in April, before tackling the disturbing weight gains of high school linemen; a runner who used a stolen identity to get into Princeton University; and the hard-knock life of Bill Johnson (above), the first American to win an Olympic gold medal in downhill skiing.</p>
