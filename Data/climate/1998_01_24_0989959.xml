        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Senseless Killing in the Seas'' (editorial, Jan. 20) is right that ''America's fisheries are not in good shape,'' but the fishing industry and its methods deserve only a small portion of the blame. As we continue to fill wetlands, empty sewer overflows in estuaries and dump garbage in the ocean, we damage the ecosystem that feeds the fishery. Because of acid rain and the greenhouse effect, water temperatures have increased in fishing areas.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Senseless Killing in the Seas'' (editorial, Jan. 20) is right that ''America's fisheries are not in good shape,'' but the fishing industry and its methods deserve only a small portion of the blame. As we continue to fill wetlands, empty sewer overflows in estuaries and dump garbage in the ocean, we damage the ecosystem that feeds the fishery. Because of acid rain and the greenhouse effect, water temperatures have increased in fishing areas.</p>
        <p>Consumers must take some responsibility, too. We have demanded white flaky fish, like cod and flounder, known as groundfish. Fifty years ago, groundfish significantly outnumbered their predators. Now the opposite is true.</p>
        <p>Fishermen could help by catching more ''underutilized'' fish like mackerel and dogfish. In Gloucester, Mass., where I was economic development coordinator from 1993 to 1995, diversification has been slow to take effect because these fish are not desired by consumers. It's time we stop blaming the fisherman for a global problem.</p>
