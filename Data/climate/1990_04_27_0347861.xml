        <p>LEAD: WITH the ebbing of the cold war, the environmental issue is moving up on the international agenda.

        <p>WITH the ebbing of the cold war, the environmental issue is moving up on the international agenda. And it is also moving up on the corporate agenda, as demonstrated by this week's Exxon stockholders' meeting in Houston at which a series of environmental initiatives were defeated even as top management insisted upon its commitment to environmental protection.</p>
        <p>Is the environment a ''motherhood issue''? Indeed, one problem in dealing with the topic is that everybody insists he or she is devoted to preserving the environment, but there is intense conflict over how to do it and at what cost to taxpayers, business or national economic interests.</p>
        <p>Last week at Harriman, N.Y., the American Assembly, a forum founded by Dwight D. Eisenhower when he was president of Columbia University, brought together 76 leading scientists, economists, business executives, political scientists and politicians, international officials and environmentalists from 19 countries to tackle the environmental problem.</p>
        <p>After four days of debate, the participants concluded that the danger of global warming was so severe that the United States should take immediate action to lessen it. That conclusion came, as the assembly statement noted, ''just days after a White House conference on the same subject at which the President and other Administration officials refused to acknowledge that the risks of global warming are sufficiently clear to merit immediate action.''</p>
        <p>In sharp contradiction to the Administration's position, the assembly declared: ''There is a scientific consensus that rising concentrations of greenhouse gases will cause global climate change. Therefore, the earth is set to experience substantial climate change of unknown scale and rate. The consequences are likely to include sea level rise, greater frequency of extreme weather events, disruptions of ecosystems and potentially vast impacts on the global economy.''</p>
        <p>It made specific recommendations on how to reduce those dangers. Warning of the ''irreversibility'' of some threats to the environment unless prompt action was taken, it called for a 20 percent reduction by the year 2005 in global carbon dioxide emissions from burning gasoline, coal, oil and other fossil fuels. And it recommended that the United States enact a ''large, phased-in increase in the Federal tax on gasoline and the adoption of a carbon dioxide emissions fee applicable to the uses of fossil fuels.''</p>
        <p>While a large majority of the participants wanted all countries to impose such taxes on carbons, they insisted that the United States, which has lower gasoline taxes than other industrial countries, should act at once on fuel taxes. But there was no consensus on whether to restrict the use of funds raised from taxes on gasoline and other carbon fuels only for developing safer technologies and other environmental purposes, rather than for other purposes.</p>
        <p>Even a heavy fuel tax would be only the beginning of an effective global program. The assembly observed that the environmental threat stemmed from three ''indivisibly linked'' global trends: human population growth, with world population, now at 5.2 billion, headed for 14 billion by the middle of the next century at present rates of growth; tropical deforestation and the rapid loss of biological diversity, and global atmospheric change, including stratospheric ozone loss and greenhouse warming.</p>
        <p>On population policy, it again criticized the Administration in urging that family planning be supported and made available ''to those who want it'' throughout the world, which it estimated would cost $10 billion a year by 2000. ''Ultimately,'' the assembly stated, ''no Administration can be regarded as serious about the environment unless it is serious about global population growth.''</p>
        <p>The threat to the global environment stems both from poverty and from affluence: poverty in the developing countries, which drives poor people to cut down forests and to have more children for the sake of family security, and affluence in the industrial countries, where rising income leads to an increase of polluting fuels and technologies.</p>
        <p>As wealth and poverty can both lead to environmental destruction, so can both Communism and capitalism - and the worst of these is almost certainly Communism, with its restrictions of public pressure on bureaucrats, and with the lack of private property giving scant incentive to individuals to protect their land and other resources.</p>
        <p>Delegates from Eastern Europe attending the assembly, which was also sponsored by the World Resources Institute, felt that their physical environments were among the worst in the world. They sought collaboration between their countries and the United States, including private business, on the environment. ''Such collaboration,'' the assembly agreed, ''is a commercial opportunity, and should be one of the more economically efficient ways of reducing environmental degradation.''</p>
        <p>Business people from the West insisted that they should not be regarded as ''the enemy,'' but rather as potential solvers of environmental problems. Some called for creation of a ''business forum'' to work with governments and environmental groups. And the assembly reached consensus in urging governments to encourage ''environmental enterpreneurship'' through the use of taxes, subsidies and other signals.</p>
        <p>But the environment is no more a ''motherhood problem'' than, say, motherhood itself, as the abortion debate proves.</p>
