        <p>I'd like to see our military scientists given the same job option that the State Department just announced for Iraq's 600 former weapons experts.

        <p>Re ''U.S. to Steer Ex-Arms Experts to Peaceful Jobs'' (news article, Dec. 19):</p>

This sensible program will spend millions on energy, environmental protection and other research, so that the Iraqi experts won't be tempted to go work for terrorists or rogue regimes.</p>
        <p>Imagine the innovations in renewable energy, high-speed rail or disease control that could result if many of our own military experts were able to shift from wasteful multibillion-dollar missile defense systems, for example, and be paid to work on more socially useful projects.</p>
