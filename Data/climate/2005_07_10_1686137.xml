        <p>The earthen cliffs near this seaside harbor town have been sporting colorful decorations recently: erosion by the gentle waves of the Irish Sea has exposed the scraggly remnants of hundreds of blue, black and yellow trash bags. The shredding plastic flutters in the wind alongside jutting scraps of rusted metal; the twisted wrecks of unidentifiable junked machines already lie on the rocky beach below.</p>
        <p>Some 200,000 tons of rubbish was buried over generations at this municipal landfill, half an hour south of Dublin, until it was closed in the early 1980's. Now that the dump is falling into the sea, the mess on the beach has become the symbolic tip of another iceberg: this tiny island nation's historic inability to deal with its garbage.</p>
        <p>Bray, some say, is the forefather of a waste-management situation that has spiraled out of control. Ireland's ''Celtic Tiger'' economy generated a vast increase in garbage over the last decade. This unpleasantly tangible side effect met with Ireland's inadequate capacity, expensive landfill fees and lax oversight to create a roaring black market in garbage collection. Construction companies and even homeowners paid unscrupulous truckers to cart away rubble and trash.</p>
        <p>Carting industry executives say as much as one million tons of waste, or 15 percent of the national total, still disappear illegally each year, and the money changing hands over it may reach up to $120 million.</p>
        <p>''It was like 'The Sopranos,''' said Liz McManus, a Labor Party member of Parliament who lives in Bray. ''It was hugely lucrative, very large scale, and some people were simply bought off.''</p>
        <p>The government is struggling to find alternatives. It has managed to get zoning and environmental approval for a huge incinerator near Cork, and hopes to build six more in what one newspaper called a ''necklace of incineration'' around Ireland. But every month the devastation of another scenic spot comes to light, littered with broken refrigerators and shattered televisions. Illegal dumps are unearthed so often that they barely warrant a headline. Some illegal landfills, with tens or even hundreds of thousands of tons of material, have been found in abandoned quarries; several have been found to contain untreated hazardous material -- like hospital waste -- that could contaminate watersheds and conservation areas, like spawning grounds for wild salmon.</p>
        <p>The seaside dump in Bray, while not an illegal site, has taken on symbolic significance because Dick Roche, the environment minister, lives here, and because Wicklow County, which contains Bray and several of the country's most egregious dumps, proudly calls itself ''the Garden of Ireland.''</p>
        <p>Geography, psychology, politics and tradition helped to lay the groundwork for the waste management problem, which has been described as a ''crisis'' for a decade, and has been turning up at the European Court of Justice as the European Union's executive branch tries to make Ireland meet its environmental standards.</p>
        <p>The Irish sense of living in a land apart -- from Europe in general and Britain in particular -- helped foster an independent streak in the national psyche, and an insistence that things here work differently.</p>
        <p>For a long time, they did. Many of the world's pressing environmental concerns have passed Ireland by. The country has no nuclear power and imports much of its electricity. Until the multinational pharmaceutical industry arrived 20 years ago, there was little hazardous waste to worry about.</p>
        <p>With Ireland's complicated zoning, there were also few places to put it. As demand has grown, fees to use the legal landfills are high: about $180 per metric ton of waste, compared with about $54 in Britain. ''It's a chicken and egg situation,'' said Steve Cowman, chief executive of Greenstar, Ireland's largest waste management company. ''We're trying to catch up, but we just don't have the infrastructure. We're moving from the dark ages.''</p>
        <p>Now that Ireland plays a larger role on the world stage -- with one of the world's fastest-growing economies, and holding key positions in European politics -- it has started to develop a more Continental-style environmental consciousness. For instance, it signed the Kyoto Protocol and is struggling to meet the ensuing commitments, though it will never contribute more than a drop in the global bucket of carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
        <p>But Nimbyism has made a real national garbage policy impossible, some analysts say. Politicians pushing for change find themselves hamstrung by an electoral system that gives favored status to local concerns -- like constituents' refusal to have a dump or incinerator built near their neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>''Our political system leads in many cases to the individual interest being put ahead of the collective interest, and consistently puts the local interest ahead of the national,'' said Peter Clinch, a professor of environmental policy at University College Dublin. ''It makes it extremely difficult to site landfills and incineration.''</p>
        <p>Professor Clinch said he knew a government minister -- the equivalent of an American cabinet secretary -- who spent time campaigning to move a speed bump in his parliamentary constituency when residents complained.</p>
        <p>The Irish have also tended to tolerate illegal dumps because they fit in with traditional practice in rural societies, according to Frank Convery, an economist and professor who wrote a book with Professor Clinch on the topic. Farmers often designate the corner of a field as a dumping ground, and have long simply burned their garbage. Complaints that runoff from illegal dumps has tainted aquifers prompted two recent judgments by the European Court of Justice that Ireland had not fulfilled its environmental commitments even after earlier scoldings. The judgments may be followed by hefty fines.</p>
        <p>The rulings have prompted some changes. The environment minister created a special enforcement team and ordered the local authorities to crack down on illegal dumping; several criminal prosecutions are under way.</p>
        <p>One weekend in May, spot checks on trucks were carried out at police roadblocks to stop garbage smugglers in the poorly patrolled area around the border with Northern Ireland. Officials in Kerry, a popular tourist destination in the southwest, have occasionally rented helicopters to search for unauthorized landfills.</p>
        <p>But for the foreseeable future, garbage will bedevil the isle.</p>
        <p>''We have a third world attitude in Ireland to the whole issue of waste,'' said Deirdre de Burca, the Green Party's spokeswoman on waste management. ''Once it's out of sight, it's out of mind. There's no sense of responsibility.''</p>
