        <p>LEAD: IN just over a month, maple sugaring season will arrive and Leon Anstett is ready.</p>
        <p>IN just over a month, maple sugaring season will arrive and Leon Anstett is ready.</p>
        <p>''I've just bought more land with a bunch of trees,'' he said. ''I've built a new sugarhouse. This year, we're going for it. We're going for broke.'' Mr. Anstett says he plans to tap up to 5,000 trees, making him one of the largest syrup producers in the state. But he is worried.</p>
        <p>''You see a lot of roadside trees that are dying,'' Mr. Anstett said. ''It's kind of frightening to see them go.''</p>
        <p>Although no formal studies have been done, some maple-sugar producers in Connecticut believe that there are an unusually large number of sugar maples dying. The industry fears the problem will get worse.</p>
        <p>The growers say that they are concerned about environmental pollution, including acid rain, which has been blamed for devastating maple forests in Canada, northern New England and parts of New York State, and that acid rain is beginning to kill trees here, as well.</p>
        <p>''I'm sure we're going to end up the same way as them,'' said Mr. Anstett, who operates Anstett's Sugar House in Goshen. ''Our trees are looking the same way their's are looking.''</p>
        <p>But several experts here disagree. They contend that Connecticut's maples are basically healthy and that acid rain is not a factor.</p>
        <p>What producers are seeing, they contend, is the normal dying of maples that have grown old or are subject to a combination of such stresses as road salt, insect defoliation or drought.</p>
        <p>All those factors can combine to cause a disease known as maple decline, in which the leaves of the tree turn a vivid yellow or red too early in the autumn, the crown of the tree becomes sparse, and the tree eventually dies.</p>
        <p>The state forester for the Connecticut Bureau of Forestry, Robert L. Garrepy, said he believed that the problem of maple decline in the state had been exaggerated. He attributed the problem to the age of the trees, some of which were planted in the late 1800's.</p>
        <p>''Like human beings, as they become older, they become sensitive to things that would not bother more vigorous organisms,'' said Mr. Garrepy, who also produces maple sugar at his Norfolk farm. ''Trees die, just like people.''</p>
        <p>Just how much the trees are threatened, as well as from what source, is a matter of disagreement among producers and tree experts.</p>
        <p>''This could put maple syrup off the shelves forever,'' said Robert Lamothe of Burlington, who last year tapped 200 sugar maples on his 147-acre tree farm, referring to acid rain. ''It's just a matter of time before we'll be out of the maple-syrup business forever. If this problem is not addressed, 20 years from now my son is not going to be sugaring.,''</p>
        <p>But other producers, among them Robert Jacquier of East Canaan, say they have not noticed any problem.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot of beautiful maples up here that are in really good shape yet,'' he said. ''The problems you see are the ones lining the road or those growing near power lines. But if we go back into the woods, we haven't seen a problem.'' Those near power lines, according to Mr. Jacquier, are susceptible to suffering from damage caused by pruning.</p>
        <p>Each year in Connecticut, an estimated 425 maple producers produce 21,000 gallons of syrup, creating an industry worth about $500,000 annually. Many of the producers are ''backyard sugarers,'' who operate family sugarhouses specializing in syrup and specialties like maple candy.</p>
        <p>Although the output is far smaller than such states as Vermont and New Hampshire, it is an industry that is gaining in popularity, and must be safeguarded, said Richard Norman, a Woodsock producer who is president of the 147-member Maple Syrup Producers Association of Connecticut.</p>
        <p>The threat to the maple trees appears to be less here than in other parts of the country, he said, but, ''anything that kills a tree is a serious threat.</p>
        <p>''Whether acid rain is the biggest cause,'' he said, ''is still unknown. But something is killing the maple trees.''</p>
        <p>The producers' concern comes after an especially bad season for syrup producers last year. To produce a good yield of sap, there must be warm days and cold nights. The early spring weather last year was devastating for the producers.</p>
        <p>''Last year wasn't a hot season, that's for sure - we like to make 250 gallons; last year, we made about 130,'' said Ray Paine, who operates R &amp; C Sugar House in Pomfret Center.</p>
        <p>But customers are eager for syrup. Because the roughly monthlong sugaring season does not begin until late Feburary, the Paines are already turning early visitors away, he said.</p>
        <p>But this year, in addition to the weather, Mr. Paine said, he is also worried about the health of his trees.</p>
        <p>''I think there is maple decline throughout New England,'' he said. ''And it is not that there may be decline. It is here.''</p>
        <p>''You cannot explain the decline we are seeing by the normal agents, such as insects, plant diseases, fungi and viruses or climatic changes,'' said the chairman of the botany department at Vermont University, Hubert Vogelmann, who has researched acid rain for years.</p>
        <p>Acid rain, the product of sulfur dioxide emissions from Middle Western factories that have been swept north and east by prevailing winds, has been cited as a cause for the widespread devastation of trees in Canada, Vermont and New York.</p>
        <p>Environmental researchers contend acid rain weakens the leaves' waxy protective layer that help them fight disease and hurts root systems by leaching sugars and amino acids, nutrients that trees require for growth, out of the soil.</p>
        <p>Dr. Vogelmann said that the problem had been heading south and that he did not believe Connecticut would escape it.</p>
        <p>''This is no longer isolated and confined to a few areas,'' he said. ''It's a regional problem. Connecticut is not going to escape it, if it continues, or particularly, if it worsens.''</p>
        <p>Acid rain is also a concern of the North American Maple Syrup Council, which represents 10,000 syrup producers in Canada and the United States, said Lynn Reynolds, a Wisconsin sugar producer who is the organization's secretary.</p>
        <p>Producers in the Middle West did not initially think they had a problem, but they have learned otherwise. Mr. Reynolds said he believed the same thing might occur in Connecticut.</p>
        <p>''Unquestionably, people in Connecticut should be concerned. They should take a look,'' he said. ''It may not be evident to them they have a problem, but if they take a look, they are going to be quite surprised. Something is going on.''</p>
        <p>The principal plant pathologist at the Federal Department of Agriculture Forest Service in Hamden, David Houston, said that he did not believe there was ''hard evidence'' linking acid rain to maple decline, but that he did support the need for more research.</p>
        <p>In many cases, he said, he believed that defolitation by insects coupled with drought was the cause. He is also studying a disease called maple sapstreak, which may play a role, he added.</p>
        <p>In sapstreak, some symptoms are similar to maple decline and, in addition, the wood near the lower stem and roots takes on a streaklike character, he said.</p>
        <p>According to Dr. Houston, the fungus that causes sapstreak enters the trees through injuries to the plant from nearby logging operations.</p>
        <p>''This isn't a wide-scale epidemic,'' he said. ''It's affecting relatively few trees. It's not like the Dutch elm disease or the chestnut blight, when thousands and thousands of trees died; this is a constant nibbling away.''</p>
        <p>The extension forester with the UConn Cooperative Extension Service, Stephen H. Broderick, maintains that the state's maple trees were generally healthy, and that, in fact, their percentage had increased over the years. ''I don't think there is any major problem affecting sugar maples in Connecticut,'' he said. ''Basically, the industry is sound, and the prospects are bright.''</p>
        <p>In 1972, a survey by the Forest Service found that the amount of sugar-maple dominated forest land in Connecticut was 276,000 acres, double the amount in the late 50's. The results of the most recent survey, taken in 1985, have not been announced, but Mr. Broderick said he believed that it would indicate that the number of maples had increased or, at least, held steady.</p>
        <p>The forest manager for the Great Mountain Forest in Norfolk, Darrell Russ, said he did not believe the trees in his part of the state were ''as healthy as they were 50 years ago.'' He also said that while he saw no cause for alarm, research should be done, because ''the only way you can make maple syrup is with maples.''</p>
        <p>''Nobody worried about the chestnut tree until it was too late,'' Mr. Russ said.</p>
