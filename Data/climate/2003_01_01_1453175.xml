        <p>Nine Northeastern states filed a legal challenge today in federal court here to new air-pollution rules for power plants and other industries, just hours after the Bush administration published those rules.</p>
        <p>The states' attorneys general said the rules, which were tentatively announced last month, constituted the most serious effort at rolling back the landmark Clean Air Act since it was enacted more than 30 years ago.</p>
        <p>They said they wanted to make a strong, swift objection and filed their legal petition for review after seeing the new rules on a government Web site this morning.</p>
        <p>The rules, published today in the Federal Register, concern a program known as New Source Review. The changes would allow thousands of aging coal-fired power plants and other industrial sites to upgrade without having to install costly antipollution devices.</p>
        <p>Eliot L. Spitzer, the New York attorney general and an organizer of the suit, said, ''The Bush administration has taken an action that will bring more acid rain, more smog, more asthma and more respiratory disease to millions of Americans.''</p>
        <p>The Environmental Protection Agency, which published the rules, defended them and said the administration followed proper procedures in issuing them administratively rather than seeking legislation.</p>
        <p>''We reaffirm that we strongly believe that these rules will be positive for the environment,'' Joe Martyak, a spokesman for the agency, said. ''We feel strongly that at the end of the day, what we've done is the right thing as well as a valid action. To say this is gutting the Clean Air Act is absolutely incorrect. It is strengthening these provisions.''</p>
        <p>The utility industry criticized the suit. The Electric Reliability Coordinating Council issued a statement saying that ''the Northeast attorneys general reflect a minority opinion,'' shaped more by economic concerns than by environmental problems.</p>
        <p>In addition to the published rules, the administration issued a new proposal that would expand an exemption allowing power plants and other industrial facilities to escape pollution controls. The suit filed by the states did not address that proposal.</p>
        <p>Their one-page petition, filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, did not state the grounds for the challenge. But legal advisers in the states said they would argue that the rules violated the Clean Air Act and that they could not be made without the consent of Congress.</p>
        <p>The states' legal action escalates a struggle between utilities and clean-air advocates that has been waged since the Clean Air Act was signed into law by President Richard M. Nixon. Industries have complained most recently to the Bush administration that the current rules, begun under President Bill Clinton, were choking off new investments in power-generating plants and discouraging energy-saving efficiencies.</p>
        <p>Because the administration had made its intentions clear when it announced the rules last month, the attorneys general had time to prepare their coordinated legal response. Expecting that the administration would publish the rules during the holidays, when few people would be paying attention, the attorneys general signed their documents in advance and delivered them to Joseph Curran Jr., the attorney general of Maryland, whose aides filed them in court here today.</p>
        <p>''We could have waited,'' said Peter Lehner, chief of the environmental protection bureau in Mr. Spitzer's New York office. ''But this is the first time there has been such a major retreat on clean air, and the states believed it was very important to respond aggressively and quickly.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lehner said he expected other states to join the suit in the next month. The nine that filed today were Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont.</p>
        <p>The filing puts Christie Whitman, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in an awkward position.</p>
        <p>As the governor of New Jersey, Mrs. Whitman had joined other states in seeking relief from Midwestern power plants whose smokestack pollution drifted eastward. Now, as head of the agency promulgating the new rules, she is in the position of defending those rules.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Spitzer and Richard Blumenthal, attorney general of Connecticut, have said that the rules proposed today would undermine their hand in prosecuting and settling the dozens of enforcement cases that as governor Mrs. Whitman had joined in bringing.</p>
        <p>''They feel like they've been sold out by her now that she's gone to Washington,'' said John Walke, a clean air expert for the Natural Resources Defense Council.</p>
        <p>In those enforcement cases, the states, the E.P.A. and environmental groups asked judges to order companies to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on pollution controls, based on the New Source Review program that the states says the environmental agency is now proposing to weaken. Mrs. Whitman said in a recent interview that the new rules did nothing to compromise the enforcement suits. ''Those are very important to me,'' she said. ''Those cases are still going forward.''</p>
        <p>Industry groups, which had pushed for the rules that were published today, hailed them and attacked the attorneys general. The National Association of Manufacturers said the rules would ''help further clean air and boost energy security'' and ''provide business planners with greater certainty as they work to increase production and limit air pollution in a cost-effective manner.''</p>
