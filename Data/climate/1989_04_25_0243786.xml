        <p>LEAD: At a conference on arms control recently, Les Aspin, the Wisconsin Democrat who heads the House Armed Services Committee, contended that the West has been far too timid in responding to Mikhail S. Gorbachev's arms-reducing initiatives.</p>
        <p>At a conference on arms control recently, Les Aspin, the Wisconsin Democrat who heads the House Armed Services Committee, contended that the West has been far too timid in responding to Mikhail S. Gorbachev's arms-reducing initiatives.</p>
        <p>Citing the recent NATO proposal for only a 5 to 10 percent cut in conventional weapons, Mr. Aspin said, ''We look like a bunch of bean counters, and Gorbachev looks like a guy who wants a different relationship in Europe.''</p>
        <p>If the Bush Administration does not speak to the mounting desire to cut military spending that the announced reductions from the East have produced, it will be bowled over by an ''avalanche'' of public opinion, he predicted, adding that to respond to Mr. Gorbachev's ''new thinking'' with a banal policy of ''status quo, plus'' simply will not do anymore.</p>
        <p>Such an analysis proposes that ''Gorby fever,'' a virus that has already swept Western Europe afflicting its victims with an uncontrollable urge to reduce the military, is beginning to spread in the United States as well.</p>
        <p>The hard evidence seems rather mixed. In the place where one would expect this epidemic to break out first - college campuses - students seem ready to march about apartheid, abortion and world hunger, but are silent when it comes to how the West responds to the Gorbachev peace offensive.</p>
        <p>''We as Americans don't seem to have focused on it sufficiently, and the student reaction is only one manifestation of that,'' observed one Harvard political theorist, Michael J. Sandel. ''It is almost as though we became so convinced that the terms of East-West politics are set in stone that we just stopped thinking about it.''</p>
        <p>Maybe, too, the question of responding to Gorbachev does not lend itself to grass-roots movements. It does not fit easily onto a bumper sticker.</p>
        <p>''To really galvanize people, movements need leadership, they need a sense of moral urgency, they need a demon and they often need a perceived crisis,'' said Gary Orren, a professor of public policy at Harvard. ''What we have now is not a perceived crisis but a perceived opportunity -without any apparent deadline. Instead of a bad guy, we have Gorbachev.</p>
        <p>''Except for wars and crisis situations,'' Professor Orren continued, ''public opinion in foreign policy has always been a game of follow the leader.''</p>
        <p>For instance, the nuclear freeze movement crumpled in the face of support for President Ronald Reagan's military buildup and then was flattened by his turnaround in accepting a treaty banning intermediate-range missiles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gorbachev has had to impose his revolution on the Soviet Union from above, with a great deal of resistance from below. President Bush would seem to have an almost free hand to respond at any pace he chooses.</p>
        <p>Look at a series of polls done by Americans Talk Security, a bipartisian consortium of four opinion research organizations.</p>
        <p>The polls found that in the last three years the public has gone from almost 2 to 1 believing that the Soviets are out for world domination to 2 to 1 believing that the Soviets are only interested in their own national security. More Americans today believe that drugs, acid rain, terrorism and competition from Japan are greater threats to national security than Soviet aggression. And though still wary of Moscow, Americans are increasingly convinced that in the age of Gorbachev, they can have plenty of security for a lot less money.</p>
        <p>No wonder Representative Lee H. Hamilton, the Indiana Democrat, says that when he walks around his home district these days, he finds that ''people think it's good that the President take time to review the situation - but not for too long.''</p>
        <p>The bottom line: while Mr. Bush is unlikely to be swept away by any public opinion avalanche to respond boldly to Mr. Gorbachev, he could certainly set one off if he wanted to.</p>
