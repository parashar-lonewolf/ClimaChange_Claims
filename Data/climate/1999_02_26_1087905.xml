        <p>There's something about deadly epidemics that both terrifies and fascinates people, drawing viewers not only to science fiction movies but also to museums. One of the best-attended exhibitions ever mounted by the American Museum of Natural History was a six-week show in 1908 that drew nearly one million people to learn about tuberculosis.</p>
        <p>After a long absence, germs are back at the museum. Tomorrow a new exhibition will open in which dozens of infectious-disease organisms will strut their stuff as computer animations, eye-catching models, photomicrographs, dioramas and even real (but dead) disease microorganisms. It is called ''Epidemic! The World of Infectious Disease,'' and in this viewer's estimation, it is the most impressive and informative exhibition the museum has mounted in years.</p>
        <p>Under the direction of Dr. Rob DeSalle, associate curator of the museum's entomology department, and David Harvey, vice president for exhibitions, modelers and craftsmen have assembled a tour through both the microscopic and human-scale habitats of dozens of disease organisms, underscoring the vulnerability of all the world's peoples to epidemics.</p>
        <p>In his story ''The Masque of the Red Death,'' Edgar Allan Poe described the nightmarish futility of trying to wall oneself off from an epidemic-ravaged world. The museum's exhibition drives home that theme with a vengeance. As the show demonstrates, the vectors that spread epidemics take countless forms. A vector may be a deer mouse carrying the deadly hantavirus. It may be a mosquito transferring malarial parasites from its gut to the blood cells and liver of a human victim.</p>
        <p>In at least one case, the vector of a disease outbreak was a Komodo dragon that licked the bars of its cage. Children visiting the zoo touched the cage bars, licked their fingers, and were thus infected by Salmonella bacteria from the big lizard.</p>
        <p>No one is immune to every disease organism to which he or she may be exposed, and human beings have had to learn to live with their microbial tormenters and invaders. The result is a never-ending battle between disease organisms seeking to penetrate and overwhelm their prey, and the immune system, which must constantly adapt itself to meet new threats.</p>
        <p>The adaptations themselves can have bad side effects. In Africa, sickle cell anemia evolved as a ''scorched earth'' strategy by the body for thwarting malaria parasites. A genetic tendency that evolved over many centuries by which red blood cells are deformed into sickle shapes reduces their ability to metabolize nutrients. But it also deprives malarial parasites of a hospitable habitat, thereby resisting invasion by the parasites. Unfortunately, sickle cell anemia, common among African-Americans, is itself a debilitating disease that renders a person vulnerable to infection.</p>
        <p>Among many gadgets devised for the show is the shadow outline of a human being lying on the floor. By stepping on any part of the shadow, a viewer can call up a display showing the disease organisms that may inhabit the corresponding part of the body.</p>
        <p>In one of the many interactive computer demonstrations created for this exhibition, two players, one representing the immune system and the other playing the role of a pathogen, try to outwit each other, mimicking the complex and ever-changing strategies played by real immune systems and microbes like the AIDS virus.</p>
        <p>The primary goal of the show is to enhance public health, and its major focus is sexually transmitted diseases, especially AIDS. But the exhibition is also a compact introductory course in microbiology and epidemiology, with something of interest for both a young child and a mature college graduate.</p>
        <p>The exhibition is organized to represent both the passage of time and the chains of causal links that spread disease.</p>
        <p>After watching a video introduction, the visitor walks through sections representing successive stages of various diseases: exposure, infection, outbreak, epidemic and finally pandemic, the global spread of an epidemic. The specific diseases viewers can follow through the exhibition include hantavirus, malaria, influenza, tuberculosis, AIDS, a disease-causing version of the ubiquitous E. coli bacterium and Lyme disease.</p>
        <p>Visitors learn the distinguishing features of five groups of notorious pathogens: viruses, bacteria, protists, fungi (including yeasts), and helminths (parasitic worms). The recent outbreak of Ebola in Africa is briefly described, and several exhibits recall the devastating influenza epidemic of 1918.</p>
        <p>The stars of the show are models made by the museum staff. One of the most impressive is a complex model, two million times as large as life and some six feet high, of a human T-cell, a component of the immune system. The model depicts an attack by spherical molecules of the H.I.V. organism. The intricacy of the details of the huge sculpture make it a masterpiece of the modeler's art.</p>
        <p>Another spectacular model represents the lining of a human stomach invaded by a strain of E. coli bacteria that has absorbed genes from shigella, an organism that causes dysentery. In adjoining sections, this huge model (which viewers are invited to touch) depicts the stomach's production of mucous to ward off the E. coli bacteria, the bacteria's eventual victory and the bloody destruction of the stomach lining.</p>
        <p>One of the most finely detailed of the models is that of a paramecium, a harmless protozoan that inhabits stagnant ponds. The museum modeler who built it, Vivian Stillwell, included not only the organism's internal parts but some 2,000 hairlike cilia, the external fibers paramecia use to propel themselves in quest of food.</p>
        <p>Some of the biology presented in this show may baffle some visitors. A few of the display labels seem to assume a basic knowledge of the nature and structure of proteins, for example. Unfamiliar terms like macrophage, T-cytotoxic cells, the CD-4 molecule and reverse transcriptase are loosely defined but not thoroughly explained, and casual viewers may sometimes feel adrift in technical jargon.</p>
        <p>Then again, it is probably too much to expect that an ordinary museum visitor would emerge from the show as an expert in immunology, microbiology and epidemiology. The excellence of the models, the arresting lighting and the animations make up for the brevity (and perhaps oversimplification) of some of the labels. All who visit the show except professional experts are certain to enlarge their knowledge of infectious disease.</p>
        <p>While emphasizing the global need to check the course of epidemic diseases, the exhibition makes the point that technological progress is not necessarily benign. The ancient Romans, by building reservoirs, inadvertently created new niches in Europe for malarial mosquitoes, for example, and by building irrigation networks to draw water from the Nile, ancient Egyptians opened pathways for the spread of schistosomiasis (snail fever caused by blood flukes) throughout the Nile Delta.</p>
        <p>Global warming, whether caused by human activity or natural agencies, presents another disease threat, the exhibition shows. When temperate regions warm up, they offer new habitats for malarial mosquitoes and the insects that transmit Chagas disease and other pandemic diseases.</p>
        <p>Clever dioramas built for the exhibition represent some of the best-known epidemics; two brown rats climbing down a ship's hawser suggest the arrival of plague in 14th-century Venice, for example, and a truck unloading produce represents an outbreak of salmonella food poisoning. A hand pump symbolizes the discovery in 1854 by John Snow that water from a pump had infected an entire English community with cholera.</p>
        <p>History has been punctuated and molded by epidemics for at least as long as human beings have left records, and for every old scourge brought under control -- smallpox, for example -- some vicious newcomer seems to crop up. The museum's epidemic exhibition may not offer sweeping solutions, but it can help a new generation of would-be microbe hunters learn the basics of their challenging craft in an entertaining way.</p>
        <p>Lecture Schedule</p>
        <p>''Epidemic! The World of Infectious Disease'' opens tomorrow and runs through Sept. 6 at the American Museum of Natural History, Central Park West at 79th Street. The exhibition's principal sponsor is the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company.</p>
