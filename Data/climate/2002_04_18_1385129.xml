        <p>Arctic Power, an organization formed to lobby for oil and gas exploration in the Alaska wilderness, sent Inupiat Eskimos to the offices of senators today to emphasize the importance of economic development to Native Alaskans.</p>
        <p>The League of Conservation Voters, which publishes an annual scorecard of how lawmakers vote on environment-related legislation, delivered a letter to all senators saying the votes this year on new drilling in Alaska would count double.</p>
        <p>Both sides were scrambling to round up last-minute support before the crucial vote in the Senate on Thursday morning on a central part of President Bush's energy policy: a measure that would permit tapping the sizable oil and gas reservoir beneath the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a stretch of untouched wilderness and potential wealth on the north coast of Alaska.</p>
        <p>By nearly all accounts, the outcome was no longer in doubt. Senators who are tracking votes agreed today that the proponents of new exploration would fail to get the 60 votes they need to win under the Senate rules. Some of the vote-counters suggested that the proponents might not have even a bare majority of 51 votes.</p>
        <p>One of the last undecided senators, Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas, announced that she would oppose drilling in the wildlife reserve, and by at least one count, she was the 51st senator to come out in opposition.</p>
        <p>Legislation to allow exploration in the refuge was passed by the House last year, but it cannot become law without Senate approval.</p>
        <p>The vote on Thursday will come on a motion to shut off debate on the issue, a test vote set up by Democratic leaders to prove to Republicans that there are not 60 votes in favor of drilling in the wilderness.</p>
        <p>The phone calls and the buttonholing in Senate offices today were the culmination of some of the most intense lobbying in years, on a measure that many lawmakers admit is more important symbolically and politically than substantively.</p>
        <p>The oil companies themselves would like to have the ban on exploration in the refuge lifted. But their support is not particularly enthusiastic, because of the high cost of producing oil and gas in the remote area. The issue has become a touchstone, on the other hand, for conservatives generally and the Bush administration particularly.</p>
        <p>Stephen Moore, president of the Club for Growth, which raises money for conservative political candidates, explained why conservatives see the issue as a matter of principle.</p>
        <p>''There is a belief on the environmentalist side that we're running out of oil, that we have to conserve energy,'' Mr. Moore said.</p>
        <p>''I'm adamantly opposed to energy conservation,'' he continued. ''We're not running out. All we have to do is go out and find it and produce it.''</p>
        <p>Betsy Loyless, political director of the League of Conservation Voters, said the issue had become a symbolic one for her side, too.</p>
        <p>''It is a litmus test to see who favors a flawed energy policy that relies on fossil fuels,'' Ms. Loyless said, ''and who supports a newer, cleaner energy policy.''</p>
        <p>The issue has been before Congress for more than a decade, and the dogmatic approach of both proponents and opponents, putting compromise out of the question, has frustrated some politicians who have tried to find a middle ground.</p>
        <p>A Democrat from the Northeast who considers himself a strong environmentalist said he had once tried quietly to see if he could broker a deal in which Democrats would back limited exploration in the wildlife reserve and Republicans would support much tougher fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks.</p>
        <p>The Democrat said he quickly gave up when it became apparent that the environmental organizations would not budge in their opposition to new drilling.</p>
        <p>''If you told the environmentalists we would end global warming once and for all in return for ANWR,'' he said, ''they'd still say no.''</p>
        <p>For more than a year, opponents of drilling have been running radio and television advertisements in the states of key lawmakers, but most of the effort against new exploration has been devoted to what Ms. Loyless called ''the biggest grass-roots lobbying campaign in a decade.''</p>
        <p>The environmentalists were opposing a formidable lobbying campaign organized by Arctic Power, which gets most of its multimillion-dollar budget from the Alaska state government but also receives backing from oil and gas companies, labor unions and private citizens.</p>
        <p>Arctic Power retained Qorvis Communications, a public relations firm, to run a $1.8 million national campaign to win public support for exploration in the refuge and hired Patton Boggs, one of Washington's most prominent lobbying firms and one usually associated with Democrats, to press the case in the capital.</p>
