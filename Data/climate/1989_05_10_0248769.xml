        <p>LEAD: Vermont is poised to become the first state to ban automobile air-conditioners that use a chemical linked to destruction of the atmosphere's ozone layer, which protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation.</p>
        <p>Vermont is poised to become the first state to ban automobile air-conditioners that use a chemical linked to destruction of the atmosphere's ozone layer, which protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation.</p>
        <p>The air-conditioners are the single largest source of the American contribution to ozone depletion, testimony before legislative committees has indicated.</p>
        <p>Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin has hailed the bill, passed May 2, as ''landmark legislation'' and is expected to sign it in the next two weeks.</p>
        <p>''We are a role model, and we may be a role model for the U.S. Congress,'' she said. Starts With 1993 Models</p>
        <p>Starting with the 1993 model year, the measure would ban the sale or registration of automobiles equipped with air-conditioners that use chlorofluorocarbons for coolant. Car air-conditioners were singled out partly because they use a form of the refrigerant considered by scientists to be the most damaging to the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>Leaks of the coolant, during car servicing, in accidents or when a car is junked, send molecules into the atmosphere where they damage the ozone layer 15 to 20 miles up.</p>
        <p>While ozone at ground level is considered a pollutant, scientists say it acts as a shield in the upper atmosphere to radiation that causes skin cancer and eye disease and damages plants and animals crucial to the food chain.</p>
        <p>The connection between chlorofluorocarbons and the ozone layer ''is not being debated anymore,'' said state Representative Curt McCormack, the bill's major sponsor. ''The argument is when can you have air-conditioners'' without them. Once Considered Ideal</p>
        <p>The auto industry is studying a substance without chlorofluorocarbons as a substitute. ''Work is continuing as if it is the substance of choice,'' said Douglas Mark, an emission engineer for the General Motors Corporation.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Mark Mark said long-term health tests of the new chemical were expected to continue through 1992, when the 1993 model-year vehicles mentioned in the Vermont law will be in production.</p>
        <p>Joan Mulhern, a lobbyist for the Vermont Public Interest Research Group, which supported the bill, cited reports prepared from data of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency showing that auto air-conditioners contributed 26.6 percent of the 330,000 tons of chlorofluorcarbons released into the atmosphere in the United States in 1985. The second-highest source was solvents, which accounted for 22.8 percent, while home refrigerants contributed 1.5 percent, she said. Once Considered Ideal</p>
        <p>An international agreement signed in 1987 called for halving chlorofluorocarbon emissions by 1999. But at a meeting in Finland last week, attended by delegates from 81 countries, scientists said ozone depletion was proceeding more rapidly than was previously believed.</p>
        <p>The refrigerant, developed in 1930 by a General Motors chemist, were considered ideal chemicals because they are non-toxic and noncombustible.</p>
        <p>The chemicals are widely used as coolants in refrigerators, freezers and other types of air-conditioners and as propellants in spray cans. The bill would also ban use of the chemicals next year for propellants in noisemakers and plastic party streamers and for cleaning private photographic or electronic equipment. Hawaii Also Passed Bill</p>
        <p>Supporters of the measure say it is the most far-reaching of the two dozen ozone-protection bills introduced in state legislatures this year. Only the Hawaii legislature has passed such a measure. Gov. John Waihee of Hawaii is expected to sign the bill, which would ban the sale of cartridges for recharging car air-conditioners with chlorofluorocarbon coolants and would raise standards for repair of car air-conditioners.</p>
        <p>Auto dealers in a state where July high temperatures average only 70 degrees did not oppose the bill. Charles Ffolliott, the Vermont representative of the National Automotive Dealers Association, estimated that more than half of the new cars sold in Vermont were equipped with air-conditioning. Nationally, about 90 percent of all new cars have air-conditioning.</p>
