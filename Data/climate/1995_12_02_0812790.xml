        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your otherwise admirable Nov. 28 front-page article on how the United States  is failing to meet its stated goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions to 1990  levels by 2000 downplays the extent of scientific concern about the threats posed by unchecked global warming.</p>
        <p>You rightly note that "scientists around the world are more convinced than ever" that emissions of greenhouse gases pose a serious threat. But you speak of "scientists' uncertainty about how serious the climate problem is." It would  be more accurate to say that scientific uncertainty about how Earth's climate system will respond to increasing emissions of greenhouse gases is itself reason for the most serious concern.</p>
        <p>For instance, the atmospheric scientist Wallace Broecker, writing in the November Scientific American, reviews evidence that the climate has been subject to far more rapid shifts than have been thought possible.</p>
        <p>These shifts, involving a sudden cooling of Europe's climate, are occasioned  by a sudden alteration of Atlantic Ocean currents, which themselves depend on particular patterns of rainfall and salinity.</p>
        <p>How ironic it would be if global heating were to lead to catastrophic cold in parts of the Northern Hemisphere, and sundry unpleasant changes elsewhere. Mr. Broecker worries that this could perhaps occur within a century, when our overcrowded planet will be more vulnerable than ever before. "It behooves us," he concludes, to better understand the climate system.</p>
        <p>It also behooves us to quit hesitating and change our social and economic behavior in ways that may seem "costly" and "Draconian" (your words) to some. For Earth's climate does not hesitate when making its own costly, Draconian changes.</p>
