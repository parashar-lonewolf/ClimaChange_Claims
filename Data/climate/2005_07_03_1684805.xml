        <p>You just can't win. With gas prices soaring like humidity levels in the Northeast, a lot of Americans were no doubt tempted to leave their Explorers and Hummers, maybe even their Priuses, parked firmly in the driveway for this latest round of national roller derby, technically known as a holiday weekend.</p>
        <p>They'll take a break, they figure, from that all-American pastime of burning up fossil fuels as fast as humanly possible. Instead, they'll stay put and indulge in that other holiday weekend favorite: firing up their $4,000 Vikings and doing a bit of Extreme Grilling.</p>

        <p>You just can't win. With gas prices soaring like humidity levels in the Northeast, a lot of Americans were no doubt tempted to leave their Explorers and Hummers, maybe even their Priuses, parked firmly in the driveway for this latest round of national roller derby, technically known as a holiday weekend.</p>
        <p>They'll take a break, they figure, from that all-American pastime of burning up fossil fuels as fast as humanly possible. Instead, they'll stay put and indulge in that other holiday weekend favorite: firing up their $4,000 Vikings and doing a bit of Extreme Grilling.</p>
        <p>The trouble is, there they are again, burning fossil fuels -- or at least byproducts thereof. For propane prices have wafted skyward along with other energy prices.</p>
        <p>But lest you think propane merely sears your burgers, the National Propane Gas Association notes that this is a $30 billion industry. Americans consumed 19.9 billion gallons in 2002 for home, agricultural, industrial and commercial uses.</p>
        <p>It provided no estimates, though, for burgers per gallon.</p>
