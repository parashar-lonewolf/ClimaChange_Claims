        <p>Jay Leno</p>
        <p>''The Da Vinci Code'' grossed more than $224 million worldwide this past weekend. In fact, today relatives of Michelangelo called and said: ''Hey, we've got a code, too. You might want to check it out.''</p>
        <p>This has really unified both parties, House Speaker Dennis Hastert has attacked the F.B.I. for raiding a congressman's office, saying it was an abuse of power. Imagine the nerve of the F.B.I. -- treating members of Congress like they were regular Americans.</p>
        <p>President Bush has proposed sweeping immigration changes -- which is pretty amazing when you consider that before he became president, Bush thought immigration was the sincerest form of flattery.</p>
        <p>David Letterman</p>
        <p>This Osama bin Laden -- no getting around it: He's creepy and he sent over another one of those videotapes. Chilling, chilling message on the videotape. He boasts that we will never find him or Jimmy Hoffa.</p>
        <p>One very dramatic scene in Al Gore's global warming movie: when a glacier melts and they find more Al Gore ballots from the election.</p>
        <p>Conan O'Brien</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the Senate voted to make English the national language of the United States. The vote drew protests from several immigrant groups and one governor of California.</p>
        <p>At the end of last night's ''American Idol,'' Ryan Seacrest pointed out that more than 63 million votes were cast, which is more than any president in history has received. In a related story, this morning Hillary Clinton bought a karaoke machine.</p>
