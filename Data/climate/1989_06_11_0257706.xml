        <p>LEAD: Vice President Dan Quayle and his family took a whitewater rafting trip down North America's oldest river today after the Army Corps of Engineers lowered the water level for a smoother ride.</p>
        <p>Vice President Dan Quayle and his family took a whitewater rafting trip down North America's oldest river today after the Army Corps of Engineers lowered the water level for a smoother ride.</p>
        <p>Mr. Quayle, his wife, Marilyn, and his children, Benjamin, Tucker and Corinne, put their raft into the New River about 10:30 A.M., accompanied by guides and three rafts filled with Secret Service agents.</p>
        <p>The Vice President had been whitewater rafting only once before, in Wyoming. He and his family received about 15 minutes of instruction today before setting off for a three-hour ride. 'Kinder, Gentler Ride'</p>
        <p>The corps of engineers informed raft operators that it would decrease flow from Bluestone Dam, 40 miles upriver, to 8,000 to 10,000 cubic feet per second today, said Susan Hanger, who runs Songer Whitewater in Fayetteville. The flow was 14,000 cubic feet per second on Friday, she said.</p>
        <p>''He'll have a kinder, gentler ride,'' added Ms. Hanger, who said recent rains would also smooth the course over rapids from Cunard to Fayette Station.</p>
        <p>The New River is at the bottom of a canyon rising to 1,000 feet. Its name notwithstanding, the river predates the glacial era.</p>
        <p>Before beginning his rafting trip, Mr. Quayle told reporters: ''We're going to be submitting clean air legislation, and this will be in the spirit of clean air. We'll get out and taste a little bit, and have a little fresh air today and enjoy the river and the scenery in West Virginia.''</p>
        <p>President Bush on Monday is expected to propose legislation requiring a 10 million-ton reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions by the end of the century to combat acid rain. Delays for Other Rafters</p>
        <p>Gov. Gaston Caperton of West Virginia, a Democrat and a whitewater rafting enthusiast, greeted Mr. Quayle at Cunard but did not go on the rafting trip. Agriculture Commissioner Cleve Benedict, the only Republican holding statewide office in West Virginia, did.</p>
        <p>An unexplained one-hour delay in the Quayles' departure caused the authorities to delay other rafters' starts. A group that had begun its trip upriver was forced to tie up along the river bank for 90 minutes and wait until after the Quayles took off.</p>
        <p>''Good morning, Mr. Vice President,'' some rafters shouted when the Quayles passed.</p>
        <p>But others were displeased that the river was not at full strength.</p>
        <p>''I was expecting something a little more challenging,'' said William Bradford of Newark, Del. ''But I understand. After all, he is the Vice President.''</p>
