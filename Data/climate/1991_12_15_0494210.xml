        <p>Two of Washington's most frequently visited and photographed monuments, the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials, will be surrounded by scaffolding and fencing for the next three to five years while they are studied and repaired.</p>
        <p>Both the memorials along the bank of the Potomac River, the Lincoln at the west end of the Mall and the Jefferson a short distance east beside the Tidal Basin, will remain open to visitors. But fences surrounding their raised terraces will keep onlookers from walking around the colonnades while National Park Service experts inspect the structures stone by stone and make repairs.</p>
        <p>Both monuments have been damaged by air pollution, acid rain and the weather.</p>
        <p>"These are such great symbols of our cultural heritage that we want to spend enough time and pay great attention to all the details of the stone work," said Earle Kittleman, a spokesman for the Park Service.</p>
        <p>The Lincoln Memorial, which opened in 1922, is one of the Park Service's most popular landmarks, attracting more than 1.2 million visitors a year, Mr. Kittleman said. The Jefferson Memorial, which opened in 1943, draws more than 750,000 visitors annually.</p>
        <p>The Park Service's Office of Historic American Buildings Survey will use a computer-assisted camera to produce measured drawings of each stone to serve as documentation for the next several centuries, Mr. Kittleman said.</p>
        <p>The Jefferson Memorial has been the subject of a similar study since last year, when a marble chunk from the top edge of its 42-foot columns crashed to the ground. Workers checked the tops of other columns and found "a good many of them were loose," Mr. Kittleman said.</p>
        <p>Pollutants and the effects of the weather have damaged the monuments, but insects also create problems. Drawn to the nearby waters, bugs swarm around the memorials, in turn attracting birds that leave droppings all over the stone, Mr. Kittleman said.</p>
        <p>Because of the birds, "there is constant cleaning going on," he said. "Over the years, the frequent washings cause leakage and problems with the stone. But none of this is as serious as to cause them to be unsafe."</p>
        <p>So far, six-foot-tall chain-link fences have been installed around the memorials and ground-to-roof scaffolding is scheduled to go up this week.</p>
