        <p>LEAD: An Arctic expedition has found chemicals in the stratosphere that threaten substantial destruction of the Arctic ozone shield, scientists said today.</p>
        <p>An Arctic expedition has found chemicals in the stratosphere that threaten substantial destruction of the Arctic ozone shield, scientists said today.</p>
        <p>The region has the same kind of disturbed chemistry that already destroys ozone over Antarctica, the scientists said. Dr. Robert Watson, a leader of the expedition, said that ''the incredible perturbation'' found in the chemistry of the Arctic stratosphere ''is a strong message to policy makers.''</p>
        <p>The expedition found no clear evidence that loss of ozone had already occurred over the North Polar region and the scientists said they could not predict with certainty that a substantial loss of ozone would occur. Any loss is not likely to be as great as that in the South Polar region, they added.</p>
        <p>Ozone in the stratosphere shields the earth's surface from harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun.</p>
        <p>The scientists said evidence about the extent of the ozone loss in the Arctic would not be available until it was known how long a slowly whirling mass of cold air remains over the region.</p>
        <p>The chemical reactions that lead to the destruction of stratospheric ozone take place within the cyclonic wind systems, or vortexes, that form in the polar winters and break up in the spring. The longer the vortex remains in place, the more ozone is destroyed. The team of scientists were from the National Aeronautic and Space Administration and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>
        <p>The scientists emphasized today that the findings were preliminary. But they, as well as other scientists, environmentalists and Congress members said the results of the expedition provided important new evidence that added urgency to the drive to end the pollution that they say is destroying the earth's ozone shield. It is now widely accepted that chlorofluorocarbons, chemicals widely used for refrigeration and insulation, as well as halons that are used for fire extinguishers, are linked to the destruction of ozone in the upper atmosphere. Skin Cancer Threat</p>
        <p>As the ozone shield thins, increased radiation from the sun is expected to cause more skin cancer and other health problems in humans, and to damage marine life, crops and forests.</p>
        <p>In recent years, satellite measurements of the Antarctic atmosphere have found dramatic declines in the ozone levels. In 1987 scientists were astonished to find that the ozone over the South Polar region declined by 50 percent. Scientists concluded that the industrial chemicals, reacting chemically on the crystalline surfaces of polar clouds, formed chemically active chlorine and bromine molecules that destroyed ozone over Antarctica.</p>
        <p>Later that year, an international treaty was approved in Montreal that would freeze production of chlorofluorocarbons starting this year and role back production by 50 percent at the end of the century.</p>
        <p>But even under the treaty, Dr. Watson said, the level of ozone-depleting chemicals in the atmosphere will double in 50 years.</p>
        <p>The new expedition, which used advanced equipment aboard two aircraft from Jan. 1 to last Wednesday, found that the same chemical process that occurred over Antarctica was happening over the Arctic region.</p>
        <p>Until this expedition, said Dr. Michael B. McElroy, chairman of Harvard University's Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, ''we had no idea if the chemistry that occurs in Antarctica occurs in the Arctic, because Antarctica is much colder.''</p>
        <p>He said that even if the Arctic vortex broke up before destroying much of the Polar ozone, the active chemicals in the stratosphere could mix with air over a broad area and deplete ozone throughout the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
        <p>The scientists on the expedition said that because meteorological conditions in the Arctic are different from those in Antarctica, the loss of ozone in the Northern region probably would not be as great as that in the South. In the Arctic, the winter vortex that traps the industrial chemicals tends to break up sooner than the Antarctic vortex.</p>
        <p>''We are not dealing with a 50 percent loss situation here,'' said Dr. Adrian F. Tuck of the atmospheric agency, an expedition leader. Dr. Tuck said about 1 percent of stratospheric ozone over the Arctic region would be lost for every day the vortex remained in place.</p>
        <p>Scientists said a significant finding of the expedition was that polar stratospheric clouds on which the chemical reactions take place were formed even in the relatively warmer Arctic temperatures. They said the findings of perturbed chemistry in the region helped explain measurements published last year that found a 5 percent to 6 percent depletion in the ozone levels in the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere since 1970.</p>
        <p>Rafe Pomerance, a senior associate of the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based research group, said the new findings ''are another major piece of the puzzle that adds to the urgency of the need to reach a decision to eliminate'' all chlorofluorocarbons.</p>
        <p>Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, said today that he would introduce legislation next week to eliminate all production of CFC's by the year 2000.</p>
        <p>Senator Albert Gore Jr., the Tennessee Democrat who has introduced legislation to ban production of the chemicals in five years, said today, ''I think people are mad about this and ready for dramatic action.''</p>
        <p>Chlorofluorocarbons are also one of the ''greenhouse'' gases, along with carbon dioxide, methane and others, that trap infrared radiation from the sun. Many scientists say those gases will result in a substantial warming of the earth.</p>
