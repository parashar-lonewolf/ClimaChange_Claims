        <p>Cruising across the country on a post-convention tour by road, water and rail, John Kerry has begun reaching out to moderate, undecided voters with a general-election message that suggests he is more confident in his base than President Bush is in his own.</p>
        <p>''I want to talk to the people who aren't here,'' he said in Hannibal, Mo., on Wednesday, a line he is repeating everywhere he goes. ''I want to talk to rural, I want to talk to conservative Missouri. I want to talk to Republicans and independents -- because I want to talk common-sense, mainstream American values.''</p>

        <p>Cruising across the country on a post-convention tour by road, water and rail, John Kerry has begun reaching out to moderate, undecided voters with a general-election message that suggests he is more confident in his base than President Bush is in his own.</p>
        <p>''I want to talk to the people who aren't here,'' he said in Hannibal, Mo., on Wednesday, a line he is repeating everywhere he goes. ''I want to talk to rural, I want to talk to conservative Missouri. I want to talk to Republicans and independents -- because I want to talk common-sense, mainstream American values.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, while Democrats note that Mr. Bush continues to talk about banning gay marriage and late-term abortions, and to visit bedrock Republican areas of the country like Michigan's Upper Peninsula, Mr. Kerry, the Democrat from Massachusetts, is rolling through the Great Plains and the high plateaus of the Southwest preaching fiscal responsibility, tax cuts, gun owners' rights and national security.</p>
        <p>In his choice of themes and in his tone, Mr. Kerry is running straight up the middle, as polls show he has solidified his backing among Democrats, with more of his supporters now saying they are voting for him as opposed to voting against Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>With a new stump speech distilled from his convention address, he is steadily suppressing the harsh tone that helped win him the nomination and leavening his message with talk of hope and values.</p>
        <p>Before, Mr. Kerry ended his speeches by saying Democrats could crow ''mission accomplished'' if he defeated Mr. Bush in November. Now, he seems to be channeling Ronald Reagan -- or letting his running mate, John Edwards, rub off on him.</p>
        <p>''We need to look to the next horizon, we need to catch on to the next dream,'' Mr. Kerry said in closing out a rally in Harrisburg, Pa. ''America's future is to be grabbed. And we're the ones who are going to grab it, and we're going to do it this November. Let's go out and make it happen -- America's hope is ahead of us, the sun is rising, our best days are ahead of us.''</p>
        <p>The John Kerry who drew more than 15,000 people in Harrisburg, 10,000 in Milwaukee, and more than 25,000 outside Union Station in Kansas City on Friday night is a far cry from the primary contender who denounced President Bush and decried all that Democrats believe has gone wrong in the Bush administration.</p>
        <p>Then, Mr. Kerry blasted Mr. Bush for ''the most arrogant, inept, reckless foreign policy in the modern history of our country.'' Now, he talks more about himself: ''I defended this country as a young man and I will defend it as president,'' he said in Kansas City.</p>
        <p>''And I know that I can run a more effective, smarter, more productive war on terror that actually makes America safer,'' he said, ''and I will do it by bringing to our side the allies that we used to have which should have been with us in the first place, I'll take the target off American troops, I'll share the burden with other nations, and we're going to get our troops home where they belong.''</p>
        <p>Then, Mr. Kerry accused Mr. Bush of ''licensing a creed of greed'' in corporate America, and summed up his bill of particulars against Mr. Bush's economic policy by shouting, ''The one person in America who deserves to be laid off is George W. Bush.''</p>
        <p>Now, Mr. Kerry mainly omits the ad hominems and says he will be a ''champion for the middle class'' who will fight to restore ''fundamental fairness'' to the workplace. ''We're going to end this craziness of American workers actually having to reward and subsidize companies for taking jobs overseas,'' he said in Kansas City. ''That's over. That's done.''</p>
        <p>His new speech remains an unfinished product. Mr. Kerry, who took up a guitar and sat in with the band on ''Johnny B. Goode'' in Jefferson City, Mo., keeps trying out new rhetorical licks on the stump. A traveling speechwriter, Josh Gottheimer, can be seen at nearly every stop listening intently and taking notes. En route by bus to a rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., Mr. Gottheimer could be heard, huddled with Mr. Kerry between two short interviews by local television crews, quietlydiscussing the speech.</p>
        <p>The sunny-side-up speechmaking clearly does not come easily to Mr. Kerry, and in St. Louis on Thursday he seemed to slip, rehashing a red-meat riff on Missouri's own John Ashcroft: ''There is nothing conservative about a certain attorney general from somewhere who silences the civil rights and civil liberties of Americans,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Kerry constantly says now that he wants to ''build this country up'' and ''bring people together,'' and tries to sound inspirational by suggesting that as president he could push the frontiers of science by asking simply, ''What if?''</p>
        <p>More important, his message is now being delivered through a one-word frame: values. Mr. Kerry is thus taking on a phrase that Republicans have used as a cudgel against Democrats for a dozen years.</p>
        <p>''Values spoken, without actions taken, are slogans, not values,'' Mr. Kerry said in Hannibal on Wednesday. ''Values are the choices we make, and I think it's time we started to demand of people in public life that you stop talking about family values, and you start valuing families.''</p>
        <p>Among the values Mr. Kerry is promoting is fiscal discipline, which he says he demonstrated in the Senate by supporting budget-balancing and deficit-reducing measures. In Beloit, Wis., he said that as president, he would avoid ''piling debt on our children's heads.''</p>
        <p>Another value he talks up, under the guise of fairness, is tax cuts for the middle class. ''You've heard the president run around talking about, 'Oh, they're going to raise your taxes,' right?'' he said in Beloit. ''Let me just put it to you as directly as I know how: Under our economic plan, 98 percent of Americans get a tax cut. Under our economic plan, 99 percent of American business gets a tax cut.''</p>
        <p>Fiscal discipline, though, can also cloak new spending for social programs, to hear Mr. Kerry talk. ''You want a tax cut?'' he said Friday night. ''I've got a tax cut. We've got to stop being content to spend $50,000 a year of your tax money to house a young person in prison for the rest of their life rather than invest $10,000 a year in Head Start, Early Start, early childhood education, after-school programs. Help these kids!''</p>
        <p>In the same way, Mr. Kerry is talking about guns in cattle country to serve a larger point about environmental conservation. ''You know, I'm a hunter and a fisherman,'' he said on a ranch in Smithville, Mo., on Friday. ''I've been a hunter since I was about 12 years old. I'm a gun owner. I believe in the Second Amendment. I know it matters out here in parts of the world. But we've got to have a habitat if we're going to hunt.''</p>
        <p>So, too, does Mr. Kerry's promise to wean the country from depending on Middle East oil appeal not only to environmentalists and S.U.V. owners pinched at the pump by soaring gas prices, but also to latter-day isolationists and others concerned about the nation's economic security.</p>
        <p>No wonder, then, that one of his best applause lines is on the improbable subject of developing alternative fuels and renewable energy sources. ''If we want our security to be in our hands, if we want our destiny to be controlled by America completely,'' Mr. Kerry said in Kansas City, ''we've got to have America have its ingenuity and creativity produce its energy -- not the Saudi royal family.''</p>
