        <p>IT looked like a promising start for Christie Whitman after seven often tumultuous years in Trenton running a state where even members of her own party were growing fed up with her.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman was greeted like a political star when she arrived here several months ago to run the Environmental Protection Agency. Not a single senator, not even her Democratic rivals, opposed her appointment.</p>
        <p>But no sooner had the former New Jersey governor unpacked her bags than she found her authority undercut by the very man who had lured her to Washington, George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>The most recent snub occurred when the White House openly contradicted a claim she made on national television two weeks ago that the administration might back away from its plans to open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling amid growing opposition in Congress.</p>
        <p>Only weeks earlier, Mrs. Whitman declared that Mr. Bush intended to fulfill a campaign pledge to lower carbon dioxide emissions from power plants -- only to find that the president had decided against that policy without so much as telling his chief environmental overseer.</p>
        <p>So it is not surprising that the public embarrassments Mrs. Whitman has had to endure at the hands of her new boss are giving rise to questions about her ability to lead the environmental agency, though she and the White House insist that there is no strife and that she is an important voice in the administration.</p>
        <p>''I love it,'' Mrs. Whitman said emphatically about her new job during an interview last week. ''The more time I spend in this job, the more I realize that the issues are so important that it is worth the hassles.''</p>
        <p>But many people here, particularly Democrats and environmentalists, are beginning to question just how much say Mrs. Whitman has in the important policy decisions that the Bush administration is making on the environment.</p>
        <p>The recent setbacks also threaten to undermine the credibility of Mrs. Whitman, a politician whose plain-spoken manner and seemingly moderate political views had made her one of the nation's most prominent governors and at one point a potential vice presidential candidate.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mrs. Whitman's nomination to head the environmental agency cheered many people on the left -- despite her mixed record on the environment in New Jersey -- who were wary of the conservative Republican crowd that had moved into the White House. But those very same people are no longer so optimistic that her voice will be heard within the new administration.</p>
        <p>Harry Reid of Nevada, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said he hoped the rift between Mrs. Whitman and the White House did not mean that more conservative forces in the administration were shaping the environmental agenda.</p>
        <p>''I hope that he would listen less to some of the more extreme voices in the administration and more to what I hope would be her moderate counsel,'' Mr. Reid said of Mr. Bush's relationship with Mrs. Whitman.</p>
        <p>But at the same time, Mr. Reid acknowledged that she appeared to have been shoved to the margins on important policy matters and was clearly no longer in charge of the agency's direction.</p>
        <p>''She has been undercut,'' he said. ''But I think she has good instincts, and I hope she will try to be more forceful.''</p>
        <p>IF Mrs. Whitman secretly harbors any regrets about having left Trenton, it may please her to know that some of her former Republican colleagues in the State House are beginning to rue the day she left.</p>
        <p>Ever since her departure in January, Trenton has descended into chaos, much like a classroom when a substitute teacher steps in. Her Republican adversaries in the Legislature -- including the acting governor himself, Donald T. DiFrancesco -- quickly began a campaign to oust Justice  Peter G. Verniero, whom she appointed to the State Supreme Court. As if to assert their control over Trenton in her absence, the Legislators contended he lied under oath in his 1999 confirmation hearings about his response to profiling when he was state attorney general.</p>
        <p>Not long after that, Mr. DiFrancesco abruptly dropped out of the governor's race only days after he forcefully declared his candidacy in the aftermath of weeks of critical news reports detailing his past business dealings.</p>
        <p>Mr. DiFrancesco, president of the State Senate for the past nine years, assumed the additional role of acting governor on Feb. 1 and appeared ready to take Mrs. Whitman's place as the unquestioned leader of the moderate wing of the state's Republican Party.</p>
        <p>With the vast powers of the governorship suddenly available to him, Mr. DiFrancesco was expected easily to  beat back a primary challenge from Bret D. Schundler, the mayor of Jersey City and an insurgent conservative candidate. But the veteran politician's past soon caught up with him.</p>
        <p>Newspaper articles disclosed that Mr. DiFrancesco was accused of acting unethically in 1998 while he served as the lawyer for his hometown government in Scotch Plains. The articles also detailed questionable business transactions, including Mr. DiFrancesco's acceptance of $225,000 from the state's largest home builder, Hovnanian Companies, to pay off a personal legal judgment in 1996.</p>
        <p>The chaos that Mr. DiFrancesco's sudden departure stirred within the state Republican party subsided a bit when former Representative Bob Franks quickly stepped in to take Mr. DiFrancesco's place in the primary on June 26.</p>
        <p>Indeed, after being battered for months by unflattering headlines about both Mr. DiFrancesco's business record and the Senate Judiciary Committee's investigation of racial profiling, Mr. Franks seemed a refreshing change to many Republicans. After all, Mr. Franks lost only narrowly to Jon S. Corzine in last year's Senate race despite being outspent 10 to 1 -- a race that Mrs. Whitman entered momentarily before taking a second look at Mr. Corzine's $500 million fortune.</p>
        <p>Leonard Lance, a Republican assemblyman from Hunterdon County, said that while some of Mrs. Whitman's Republican detractors had said good riddance when she left Trenton, the problems that came to engulf the party suddenly gave them reason for pause.</p>
        <p>''You hear people grumble that we don't miss her,'' Mr. Lance said. ''That's simply not true. She's won two statewide races, even though Republicans win fewer statewide races than Democrats do in New Jersey. Her presence in the governor's office would be enormously helpful in retaining it this year.''</p>
        <p>For her part, Mrs. Whitman laughed off the notion that people in Trenton were suddenly filled with nostalgia over the Whitman era. ''I wasn't so bad after all,'' she joked when asked about the revisionist impulses stirring in the State House. ''I can only hope that stays.''</p>
        <p>MRS. WHITMAN'S new role here is a drastic departure from her life in Trenton, where she held one of the most powerful governorships in the nation, with the authority to appoint the heads of all state agencies, all judges of the state courts and all members of intrastate and bistate authorities and commissions -- without having a nettlesome lieutenant governor to deal with.</p>
        <p>To be sure, her workload is still heavy, but it is often filled with the kind of drudgery that occupies any head of a large bureaucracy. An average workday begins about 7:30 a.m. with breakfast meetings, speaking engagements and the like. Then she typically huddles with her senior staff at her offices, has business lunches and heads to Capitol Hill to testify at hearings on issues like the Superfund program, brownfield cleanup and acid rain.</p>
        <p>During the week, Mrs. Whitman stays in Washington at her new apartment downtown, where she fills the evenings reading reports and memorandums. She had hoped to spend weekends back home in New Jersey with her husband, John, a financial consultant, but her schedule has not permitted that. Instead, he has had to travel to Washington to spend time with her.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman clearly had no illusions about how different it would be for her to go from running a state to being the head of an agency that deals with many arcane, albeit important, issues. Or so she said during a speech just after taking her new job.</p>
        <p>''One of the wonderful things about being a governor is that you can make decisions that affect people's lives in ways that you actually get letters back saying, you know, 'Thank you. I have my first job now because of welfare reform.' Or, 'Thank you. For the first time I am going to a physician for a checkup because I now have health insurance,' '' Mrs. Whitman said.</p>
        <p>''I don't think I'm going to get any of those as head of the E.P.A.,'' she continued somewhat lightheartedly. ''I am just trying to keep people from going berserk when they get mad at me, because everybody will be mad. And keep the lawsuits to a minimum of two or three per decision.''</p>
        <p>When she first arrived here, Mrs. Whitman got an enthusiastic bipartisan welcome, with the vote 99 to 0 to approve her nomination as administrator of the environmental agency, making her path to confirmation far less rocky than that of many of Mr. Bush's other appointments like John Ashcroft at the Justice Department and Gale Norton, the choice to run the Interior Department.</p>
        <p>But to the surprise of many, Mrs. Whitman's tenure has been marked not so much by conflicts with environmental groups but rather by conflicts with members of her own administration.</p>
        <p>The most notable episode occurred on March 13, not long after she started her new job. Facing pressure from conservative Republicans and industry groups, President Bush said he would not seek to regulate power plants' emissions of carbon dioxide, a gas that many scientists say is a leading contributor to global warming.</p>
        <p>In doing so, Mr. Bush's stance reversed a pledge he made during the campaign to cut such emissions, and it created a sudden public relations crisis for Mrs. Whitman, who just 10 days earlier had talked about Mr. Bush's campaign promise as if it had already been implemented.</p>
        <p>To make matters worse, it was disclosed that Mrs. Whitman had sent a confidential memo to the president  recommending that he demonstrate his support for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>John F. Sheehan, the communications director for the Adirondack Council, a New York-based environmental organization devoted to air-quality issues, said the episode  raised questions about Mrs. Whitman's relevance in the administration.</p>
        <p>''It put her in a position of appearing not to have control over environmental policy,'' Mr. Sheehan said. ''It makes it difficult for people to believe that she has the final say when they are negotiating with her on environmental matters.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman's aides and the White House have tried to play down that incident, as well as the other in which the Bush administration publicly corrected her after she suggested on national television that the administration was prepared to back off its plans to allow drilling in a 1.5-million acre of the 19-million-acre wildlife preserve in Alaska.</p>
        <p>At the time, Mr. Bush's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, dismissed the episode as if Mrs. Whitman, a two-term governor, was a political neophyte, by saying, ''I think there was some confusion.''</p>
        <p>Today people close to Mrs. Whitman describe the two incidents as isolated events that do not reflect the degree to which Mrs. Whitman and President Bush agree on environmental matters. They say that Mrs. Whitman is still very much in control of her agency and that the President values her opinion.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Bush lavished great praise on Mrs. Whitman at a recent White House ceremony in the State Dining Room, where he handed out environmental awards to a handful of students.</p>
        <p>''Christie Todd, you're doing a great job,'' the president said as Mrs. Whitman stood at his side. ''I knew she was going to do a great job when I picked her. I didn't realize how good. And she really is -- I'm proud to have her on my team.''</p>
        <p>And in a recent interview, Mrs. Whitman sought to minimize her apparent differences with the White House, noting that in the case of carbon dioxide emissions, the president was acting out of broader concern over what effect the new regulations for power plants would have on energy production.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Mrs. Whitman said, her position on the issue of carbon dioxide emissions stemmed from her more narrow point of view as the head of the Environmental Protection Agency. ''He has to look at it from a broader perspective,'' she said of President Bush.</p>
        <p>But many environmentalists and Democrats are not sure how much authority she has these days.</p>
        <p>''I respect Christie enormously, but I think the administration undermined her,'' said Senator John F. Kerry, a Democrat from Massachusetts who is a prominent advocate of the need to address global warming, recently told The Washington Post.</p>
        <p>''The question is being asked: 'Does she speak for the administration, and will she be able to enforce environmental laws and seek others where necessary?' '' Mr. Kerry said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman insists that she has a direct access to the president whenever she needs it. ''He's always been supportive when I have gone to him,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman also sought to dispel any notion that she was not in charge of her sprawling agency. To bolster this notion, she noted that it was she, not the White House, who was behind at least one recent decision that Democrats and environmentalists decried as hostile to the environment: re-evaluating a regulation instituted under President Bill Clinton's administration that called for cutting the amount of naturally occurring arsenic in municipal drinking water.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman said she approached the White House with the idea of reviewing the regulation, which environmentalists contend is needed to protect the public's health. ''They pushed back,'' she recalled of the White House reaction. ''They said, 'Do you really want to do that?' ''</p>
        <p>In the end, Mrs. Whitman's decision to re-evaluate the issue of arsenic eased the concerns of representatives of the mining industry and some municipal officials -- who said that the regulation merely created new costs with no clear health benefit. But it came at a price, earning her derision and a flood of one-liners from comedians and even fellow politicians.</p>
        <p>Moreover, it allowed the Democrats to stake out a comfortable political position in the battle over the environment. Interestingly, ground zero in the environmental wars may have been the pump house of a closed arsenic-plagued well in Hopewell Borough. The well is not only in this swing state but also in the Congressional district of Representative Rush D. Holt, one of the most competitive in the nation, encompassing Princeton University, new office complexes, farmland and suburban sprawl.</p>
        <p>Mr. Holt, a former assistant director of the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, said he considered the environment and related concerns about suburban sprawl and open space part of a cluster of issues that had helped him prevail in an area long considered safely Republican.</p>
        <p>And he said his constituents, including many Republicans, had taken notice of events in Washington.</p>
        <p>''Arsenic,'' he said. ''That hit a nerve because arsenic sounds like poison.''</p>
        <p>That Mrs. Whitman would take such a controversial  stance comes as no surprise to people who know her record as governor in New Jersey, where there is some debate over the depth of her commitment to the environment.</p>
        <p>Jeff Tittle, director the New Jersey Chapter of the Sierra Club, says that Mrs. Whitman and Mr. Bush are more like-minded than people think.</p>
        <p>''She wants to look green,'' Mr. Tittle said. ''The reality of her record in New Jersey was that she was bad when it came to protecting the environment and public health. But she was good at promoting herself, particularly on open space.''</p>
        <p>Her efforts to protect the coastline as well a million acres of woods and farmland from development have drawn praise from nearly every environmental group in the state, helping reinforce her image as a practitioner of moderate Republicanism.</p>
        <p>Yet she has also been assailed by environmentalists who insist that her pro-business leanings drove her to scale back regulations and foster a more cooperative relationship with industry and developers.</p>
        <p>As Edward Lloyd, a professor at Columbia University Law School and a former director of the Rutgers Environmental Law Clinic, put it shortly after Mrs. Whitman assumed her new job: ''She is certainly good on open space. That is what she is best known for in the environmental area. On the regulatory side, there is a very different story to tell.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, environmentalists in New Jersey point to Mrs. Whitman's staff cutbacks in the state Department of Environmental Protection, abolition of the environmental prosecutor's office and eased reporting rules for companies that handle toxic materials.</p>
        <p>As for her new job in Washington, Mrs. Whitman says she is in it for the long haul despite speculation that she has grown frustrated because of the bumpy start.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman even ruled out the possibility of a run next year against Senator Robert G. Torricelli, who is currently the subject of a wide-ranging investigation by federal prosecutors that includes accusations of influence peddling and bribe-taking.</p>
        <p>''No way,'' she said. ''I'm in the E.P.A.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 13, 2001, Sunday  An article last Sunday about Christie Whitman's difficulties as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency misspelled the surname of the director the New Jersey Chapter of the Sierra Club, who was critical of her record. He is Jeff Tittel, not Tittle.</p>
