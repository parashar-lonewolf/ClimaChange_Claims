        <p>Lawrence Wright is not an actor, nor is he a monologuist; he has even struggled with a fear of public speaking. So what's he doing in a one-man show that has a six-week run at the Culture Project?</p>
        <p>Mr. Wright is the author of ''The Looming Tower: Al-Qaeda and the Road to 9/11'' (Alfred A. Knopf), the critically praised nonfiction best seller about the rise of Islamic terror and America's lagging response. The show, ''My Trip to Al-Qaeda,'' is a first-person account of some of Mr. Wright's experiences while writing his book, mixed in with some of the history lessons that appear in its pages. There are videos and photos in the presentation, and some onstage props. But is it really theater?</p>
        <p>''What interests me is something that takes place onstage that causes a reaction in the audience,'' said Allan Buchman, the artistic director of the Culture Project. ''Whether it's theater or not is less crucial to me.''</p>
        <p>Those involved with the show -- which was first performed at the New Yorker Festival last October and begins its run on March 1 at the Culture Project, at 55 Mercer Street, at Broome Street, in SoHo -- compare it to a Spalding Gray monologue, Anna Deavere Smith's ''Fires in the Mirror,'' David Hare's ''Via Dolorosa'' and even Al Gore's traveling PowerPoint presentation on global warming that was the basis for the movie ''An Inconvenient Truth.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Buchman said that because of the uneasy global political climate, there was a greater urgency in the dramatic world to find new approaches to commentary. As an example, he said, officials from the aid group Doctors Without Borders approached the Culture Project about forming a story out of their work.</p>
        <p>''We're finding that people are coming to us who feel that their stories will be more effective if they can climb off the op-ed page,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wright, having spent nearly five years researching the book, decided last year that he would write a musical comedy about the making of the 1963 Elizabeth Taylor-Richard Burton film ''Cleopatra.'' (Mr. Wright has written two plays that were produced in Austin, Tex., and several screenplays, including ''The Siege,'' the 1998 movie about Islamic terror in New York.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Wright brought up the ''Cleopatra'' idea to André Bishop, the artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater, who was less than encouraging.</p>
        <p>''I still think it sounds like fun,'' Mr. Wright said in an interview yesterday.</p>
        <p>There was also another piece he had been considering. While reporting ''The Looming Tower,'' Mr. Wright said, he found himself straining to maintain journalistic objectivity while interviewing people who endorsed acts of extreme cruelty.</p>
        <p>''It was really difficult for me to keep my emotions under control,'' he said. He began toying with the idea of writing something that would relate his experiences while working on ''The Looming Tower,'' but he did not want to write another book.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bishop encouraged him to pursue a one-man show. Mr. Wright, a staff writer for The New Yorker, worked on the show for a few months and presented a draft of the piece at the magazine's festival.</p>
        <p>The show recounts interviews that Mr. Wright conducted, as well as what he was thinking during those interviews; observations of life in Saudi Arabia, where he worked as a journalist; and his commentary on the changes in American policy since 9/11.</p>
        <p>The Public Theater expressed interest, but Mr. Buchman made an immediate offer for space at the Culture Project.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wright is not sure what will happen next: how he will manage a performance schedule he is not used to (or performing at all, for that matter); whether the show will have a life after its run at the Culture Project; or even if an actor will step into the role, essentially playing Mr. Wright.</p>
        <p>''I'm sure that at some point,'' he said, ''I'm going to want to get back to my much different, much more private, writing life.''</p>
