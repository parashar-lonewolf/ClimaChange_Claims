        <p>After nearly a year of steady bad news, including adverse court rulings and the usual indifference in Congress, clean air advocates have now won two important legal victories in quick succession. The rulings are a tribute to the persistence of Carol Browner, who has made cleaner air the signature issue in her seven-year tenure as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. They also send a clear message to the big utility companies that own the aging, coal-fired power plants that lie at the root of many of the country's pollution problems. The message is that these companies are running out of places to hide from the judges and the regulators -- and that instead of seeking legislative relief from Congress, they would be better off accepting the inevitable and installing the pollution controls they should have built years ago.</p>
        <p>The first and more important victory was a ruling by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The ruling upheld a federal plan sharply restricting the pollution that drifts eastward from power plants in the Midwest and border states and causes unacceptable levels of smog in the Northeast.</p>

        <p>After nearly a year of steady bad news, including adverse court rulings and the usual indifference in Congress, clean air advocates have now won two important legal victories in quick succession. The rulings are a tribute to the persistence of Carol Browner, who has made cleaner air the signature issue in her seven-year tenure as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. They also send a clear message to the big utility companies that own the aging, coal-fired power plants that lie at the root of many of the country's pollution problems. The message is that these companies are running out of places to hide from the judges and the regulators -- and that instead of seeking legislative relief from Congress, they would be better off accepting the inevitable and installing the pollution controls they should have built years ago.</p>
        <p>The first and more important victory was a ruling by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The ruling upheld a federal plan sharply restricting the pollution that drifts eastward from power plants in the Midwest and border states and causes unacceptable levels of smog in the Northeast.</p>
        <p>The ruling delighted environmentalists and stunned the industry because another three-judge panel on the same court -- one of the most conservative in the country -- had issued an injunction against a similar plan last year. In the interim, however, Ms. Browner adjusted the plan in a way that did not appreciably weaken its provisions but managed to satisfy the court.</p>
        <p>The second victory came in the form of an agreement by a Florida utility, the Tampa Electric Company, to spend $1 billion to switch one of its plants from coal to natural gas, a much cleaner fuel. The company also agreed to make major changes at another plant to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide, which causes smog, and sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain. The agreement was the first to flow from lawsuits that the E.P.A. filed last November against Tampa Electric and six other utilities. The lawsuits were based on a largely untested provision of the 1970 Clean Air Act requiring utilities that significantly upgrade their older plants to install the same modern pollution-control equipment that would be required in a new plant.</p>
        <p>The other utilities charged with violating the law last November insisted that the Tampa Electric agreement would not stampede them into similar settlements. But the momentum in the clean air wars has shifted dramatically in the last few months. Early last summer clean air advocates were on the run, largely because of court rulings that seemed to undermine Ms. Browner's strategy. But along the way, she picked up some important allies. The Northeastern governors petitioned her to start shutting down individual plants in the Midwest, which she agreed to do. In an effort to set an example to Midwestern states, Gov. George Pataki of New York ordered major cuts in pollution from utilities inside his state's boundaries. Meanwhile New York's attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, began suing Midwestern power plants under the same provision of the Clean Air Act that Ms. Browner eventually used.</p>
        <p>Now that the D.C. Circuit has begun to turn around on clean air issues, it is the big utilities that are on the run. These companies are strong and resourceful and will not give up easily. But even the most defiant among them must see that the time has come to clean up their plants.</p>
