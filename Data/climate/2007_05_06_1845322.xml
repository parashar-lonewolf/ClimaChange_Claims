        <p>To the thoughtful discussion of antisecularism, we could usefully add the distinction between religious identity and religious ethics (Russell Shorto, April 8). Narrowing religions to questions of identity is something that even the Bible critiques. Such identity politics is not only a source of tension; it has bred the ''kill the infidel'' mentality that erupts into religious violence. Religious ethics, on the other hand, enjoins people to be responsible for the lives and well-being of others, to care for the widow, orphan and stranger -- values that can form the core of a consensus among culturally diverse people. In this light, it is small wonder that lay religious groups committed to social justice are on the rise at the same time that church attendance is falling.</p>

        <p>It is still commonplace among religious conservatives like Pope Benedict XVI to claim that godlessness is akin to moral failure and that reason without faith leads to catastrophe. But the secular Europe of today offers a wealth of counterexamples. Europe is home to many of the world's least corrupt governments; its people have a high degree of environmental consciousness (find a nation in the European Union that has not signed the Kyoto Protocol). Based in its cities are a vast number of organizations aiming at the promotion of peace and justice around the globe (Doctors Without Borders, Oxfam, the International Red Cross and Amnesty International, to name just a few). Virtually no European country has the death penalty. And finally, Europe has some of the world's lowest levels of poverty and crime. We ought to give up the exhausted notion that nations and individuals can act morally only if they have religious faith.</p>
