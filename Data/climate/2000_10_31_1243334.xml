        <p>As Canadian soldiers hoist duffel bags from troop transports at a gravel airstrip here, a large red maple leaf signboard greets the new arrivals with the words, in English and French, ''Proudly Canadian.''</p>
        <p>But even this military post in the Canadian Arctic, 2,700 miles north of the American border, cannot escape the southern neighbor's shadow. On maps, Canada's northernmost outpost is sandwiched between the Lincoln Sea and the United States Range, named by an American Navy mission in 1871. And even though Alert serves as a base for Canadian research into greenhouse gases and Arctic bird migrations, financing of science by the Canadian government is lagging in the rest of the Arctic, helping Americans to dominate northern scientific research at the top of the world.</p>
        <p>''Canadian scientists are starting to resent what appears to be an American takeover of the Far North,'' Ed Struzik, a veteran reporter on the Arctic, warned last summer in The Edmonton Journal. He listed a series of American projects: fossil forest research on Axel Heiberg Island by a University of Pennsylvania team; a NASA project replicating Mars conditions in an asteroid crater on Devon Island; and the passage through Arctic waters this summer of a new United States Coast Guard cutter, the Healy.</p>
        <p>A multidisciplinary panel of Canadian university professors sounded a similar theme this fall in their report, ''A Crisis in Northern Research.'' To help Canada catch up, the professors called on Ottawa to finance 24 research chairs, 80 research fellowships and 70 new research projects dedicated to the Canadian Arctic.</p>
        <p>But for some, Canada's latest interest is reactive, and half-hearted.</p>
        <p>''Canada has always had a reactive interest in the Arctic -- this is the latest spasm,'' said Jerry Kobalenko, a visitor here who is writing a book on Ellesmere Island, Canada's last stop before the North Pole.</p>
        <p>Ninety percent of Canadians live along their southern border. ''Even though the Canadian public pretends it likes being an Arctic country, it is looking entirely southward,'' said Dr. Rob Huebert, associate director of the Center for Military and Strategic Studies at the University of Calgary.</p>
        <p>Richard Weber, a polar skier who runs a travel business, Canadian Arctic Holidays, said: ''Canadians live in a cold country, so they think, 'why go to the Arctic?' The average Canadian does not know a lot about the Arctic.''</p>
        <p>But just as predominantly coastal Brazilians tend to ignore the Amazon until someone else turns up there, Canadians focus on their vast backyard when outsiders seem to be interfering: proposing ''internationalization'' of the Arctic, proposing United Nations supervision of Native populations, or sending well-financed foreign scientific expeditions.</p>
        <p>This summer, some Canadians groaned at the return of a University of Pennsylvania research team to an island west of here, where the previous summer they had taken samples from a mummified forest. Noting that the American team's budget was 100 times that of a rival Canadian team, the Edmonton newspaper published a photograph of a man lugging a huge chunk of wood from a hole, with the caption, ''An American scientist removes a 45-million-year-old piece of wood last year from a fossil forest on Canada's Axel Heiberg Island.''</p>
        <p>Turning to the Arctic waters of the Northwest Passage, a maritime route claimed by Canada, James P. Delgado, executive director of the Vancouver Maritime Museum, wrote in Toronto's Globe and Mail newspaper, ''Our northern frontier is ours thanks to the blood sacrifice the Arctic exacted from our explorers.''</p>
        <p>But, with warmer weather increasingly making commercial and scientific ship traffic a summer reality in the Arctic, some Canadian officials are taking less nationalistic stands. In an interview before stepping down as foreign minister in mid-October, Lloyd Axworthy, a Liberal member of Parliament, called for moving beyond the ''standoff between the United States and Canada'' over shipping rules in the Arctic. He called for a multilateral government group, like the Arctic Council, to set universal rules for safe shipping in all Arctic regions, whether in Russian, American, Canadian, Greenlandic or Norwegian waters.</p>
        <p>Despite calls from Canadian professors and journalists, Ottawa has not chosen to increase research financing or to block outsiders from studying the Canadian Arctic. For the moment, Canadian Arctic research seems to be a matter of the ability to pay.</p>
        <p>''You have to pay to play,'' said Dr. Kirk R. Johnson, curator of paleontology at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, who has participated in American projects at the fossil forest and the crater site. ''Science is full of people who have sour grapes, who didn't get the funds. If you do the research, if you publish the papers, you get the funding.''</p>
        <p>Stressing that most American polar research is in the Antarctic, Dr. Johnson conceded that Canada, with an economy less than one-tenth that of the United States, would always have a hard time matching American Arctic science budgets.</p>
        <p>Here at Alert, a combined military and weather base, budget cuts and technological modernization have led Canadian forces to cut staffing by two-thirds over the last decade, to 69 men and women this winter. But even though this station needs 180 cargo flights of food and fuel to get through the long winter, Canadians are determined to keep the maple leaf flying on their northernmost tip.</p>
        <p>''Physical occupation of land is the most important element of sovereignty -- you have to be there,'' said Col. Pierre LeBlanc, who stepped down in July as northern commander of the Canadian forces.</p>
        <p>Early in the 20th century, Ottawa was stirred to explore the Arctic only after foreign intrusions. Americans mounted discovery missions. A Norwegian explorer tried to claim some islands for Norway. A Danish trader undiplomatically described this massive island, unpopulated at the time, as ''no man's land.''</p>
        <p>In this century, new technology may bring a boom in Arctic mining and production of oil and gas. If the climate continues to grow warmer,  the Northwest Passage could become a regular shortcut for freighters going from Europe to Asia.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately for Canadian researchers, though, Canada pays $20 million a year to keep this base going for reasons more military than scientific. Ideal for intercepting Russian radio communications, this base, 507 miles south of the North Pole, is closer to Moscow than to Ottawa. Mr. Huebert described this polar station, bristling with antennas and far from urban radio pollution, as ''a very clear listening point, like going to the top of a hill.''</p>
        <p>But in the 1990's, through automation and improved technology, the United States and Canada closed most of the staffed radar stations that once were strung across the Arctic. With half the staff and radar sites, military leaders say they now have better early warning capability than ever if Russian missiles ever come over the pole.</p>
        <p>With Alert's power generators burning 60 gallons of airlifted diesel an hour, it is unclear how long Canada will keep so many people at a post that descends into five months of polar night every October.</p>
        <p>As privatization spreads in Canada, some people wonder whether scientists and tourists could supplement soldiers in asserting modern sovereignty. At this base, the northernmost human settlement in the world, there are housing wings where bedrooms gather dust because their military occupants pulled out years ago.</p>
        <p>With scientists increasingly interested in climate change and affluent tourists attracted by Ellesmere Island National Park, only 25 miles southwest of Alert, this base could defray costs by taking in nonmilitary visitors. The flow of scientists here is only a trickle, compared with what it could be.</p>
        <p>''There clearly is a huge interest among the Canadian scientific community,'' Rick Boychuk, editor of Canadian Geographic magazine, said on a visit here. ''I am sure there are entrepreneurs who would see great potential here, giving logistical support for scientists, as well the chance for tourists to take a very unique and original peak at the Arctic.''</p>
        <p>But Alert's soldiers, instilled with half a century of pride as the ''frozen chosen,'' blanch at such a change in mission. Referring to the Department of National Defense, one major visiting here from Ottawa rolled her eyes and said: ''D.N.D. is not in the business of running bed and breakfasts.''</p>
