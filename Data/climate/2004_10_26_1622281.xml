        <p>On environmental issues, especially climate change, science is important but rarely definitive. Where science is not definitive, it is just one of many factors that policy makers must consider (''Bush vs. the Laureates'').</p>
        <p>In the 1990's, Vice President Al Gore repeatedly asserted that climate science was settled even though it was not. One distinguished scientist was fired for telling him that. Where was the outcry then?</p>
        <p>The Environmental Protection Agency during the Clinton years was the most politicized in memory. It pushed regulations that went beyond what science and economics could justify. Where were the complaints then?</p>
        <p>That silence may be more telling than today's rhetoric.</p>
