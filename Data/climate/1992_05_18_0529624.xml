        <p>In her speech at Smith College's 114th commencement exercises yesterday, Gov. Ann W. Richards of Texas recalled a time when "women made the coffee and men made the decisions."</p>
        <p>But Governor Richards, addressing the 767 undergraduates and 73 graduate students on the campus of the women's college in Northampton, Mass., said that things have changed: "Men have learned to make coffee, and a few of us are in decision-making positions."</p>
        <p>She urged the students to "make the difference between a system that collapses under its own tired weight and a system that is rejuvenated."</p>
        <p>"It's not that women are better than men," said Governor Richards, who received an honorary degree from Smith. "But I hope we all accepted long ago that we are different."</p>
        <p>She added, "When you add someone whose understanding is not intellectual, but instinctive, the whole equation changes."</p>
        <p>Other recipients of honorary degrees were: Karen N. Horn, a banker and former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland; Zara Nelsova, a cellist and teacher at the Juilliard School; Anne P.

        <p>Haverford awarded a Doctor of Letters degree to Ms. Wattleton, who resigned from Planned Parenthood this year to start a syndicated television talk show.
