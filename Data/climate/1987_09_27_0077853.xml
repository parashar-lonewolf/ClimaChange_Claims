        <p>LEAD: INCH by inch, the Great Lakes have been receding, uncovering beaches and breakwaters that had been inundated by record water levels.

        <p>LEAD: INCH by inch, the Great Lakes have been receding, uncovering beaches and breakwaters that had been inundated by record water levels. In Lake Forest, Ill., for example, gauges show Lake Michigan a full 18 inches lower than it was only 11 months ago.

        <p>INCH by inch, the Great Lakes have been receding, uncovering beaches and breakwaters that had been inundated by record water levels. In Lake Forest, Ill., for example, gauges show Lake Michigan a full 18 inches lower than it was only 11 months ago. The city has just completed a $9 million project to restore a lakefront park destroyed by water that rose nearly five feet between 1955 and 1986.</p>
        <p>But while the retreating waters have been good news for property owners, who last year suffered millions of dollars in damage from shoreline erosion and flooding, the threat of high water is not over yet. Although the driest winter and spring ever recorded in the upper Midwest did bring the lakes down, they are still more than a foot above the previous average for most of this century. That means there is almost certain to be some coastal flooding again before spring.</p>
        <p>To those who study the lakes, last year's record high levels, like this summer's sharp drop, are a measure of the one certain and fundamental truth about the basin: There is no such thing as a normal lake level. This, in turn, means that lakeside residents must accommodate themselves to nature's unpredictable rhythms.</p>
        <p>''We simply cannot say whether the lakes, over the long term, are rising or falling,'' said Marie Sanderson, a scientist with the Great Lakes Institute of the University of Windsor, in Ontario. ''We only have about 75 years' worth of records on which to base our judgments.''</p>
        <p>Analyses of ancient beachlines indicate that as recently as the 17th century, water levels averaged several feet higher than they were when most existing shoreline structures went up. ''If the past is any indication of the future, we are indeed at a low point,'' said Thomas Croley, a research hydrologist with the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Mich.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, a recent study by the University of Windsor suggested that in the future the lakes might be much lower. Evaporation will increase, the study concluded, as a result of the greenhouse effect, the global warming trend caused by a buildup of carbon dioxide and manmade gases in the atmosphere. At worst, Dr. Sanderson said, water levels might fall so low as to imperil Great Lakes shipping.</p>
        <p>A joint study by the United States and Canadian Governments is taking a detailed look at Great Lakes levels, including whether building or modifying dams and locks would make it possible to regulate lake levels. Another proposal is to dynamite obstacles in the St. Lawrence, speeding up the river that drains the system.</p>
        <p>But other officials argue that such solutions are too extreme, too costly and unlikely to work. Not Like a Tub</p>
        <p>''There is a perception that we can somehow control lake levels, like water in a bathtub,'' said William Brah, the president of the Center for the Great Lakes in Chicago, a regional research group. ''But such projects require massive public expenditures, at a time when the Government is no longer putting money into massive water projects.''</p>
        <p>As an alternative, Mr. Brah and others in the region are advocating ''nonstructural'' solutions - tighter controls on coastal development, public buyouts of threatened property and the creation of special assessment districts to raise the money to build shoreline buffers.</p>
        <p>Some communities in New York and Pennsylvania now require that new development be set hundreds of feet back from Lake Erie. Lake Forest, Ill., Lakewood, Ohio, and Whitefish Bay, Wis., have completed ambitious projects to armor their shores against erosion. And in Ontario, the government is studying the creation of a Shoreline Management Council to regulate construction in threatened areas.</p>
        <p>''The main point we need to make is, just because water levels have dropped this year doesn't mean the problems along the lakes are over,'' said Peter McAvoy, a land use specialist at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee. ''Rather than being complacent, communities now have an opportunity to take some action'' before the next cycle of high water.</p>
