        <p>As health concerns about Coca-Cola products spread to Spain and Germany, the company's top executive flew to Brussels yesterday to try to solve the growing public relations problem that began a week ago when Belgians fell ill after drinking Coke.</p>
        <p>M. Douglas Ivester, the chairman and chief executive of the Coca-Cola Company, arrived in the Belgian capital to assure the public and Government officials that Coke's products were safe to drink. But the company is being criticized as slow to respond to a crisis, one that increasingly appears to be born of panic rather than reports of serious illness. At risk is the reputation of the world's best-known brand.</p>
        <p>''This is like the worst of all worlds for them,'' said Emanuel Goldman, a global consumer-products analyst for Merrill Lynch. ''Coke is associated with purity. You go to a third-world country where you're not sure of the water, and you drink Coca-Cola.''</p>
        <p>Germany warned consumers yesterday to avoid any Coke products not manufactured in Germany in case some from bottling plants in Belgium or France, where the problems began, had crossed the border, Bloomberg Business News said.</p>
        <p>Spain took stronger action, as regional health officials removed cans and bottles of imported Coca-Cola products from stores. Coca-Cola Espana, the company's division in Spain, took out full-page newspaper advertisements saying the products made in Spain ''have a full health guarantee and pose no risk for consumers.''</p>
        <p>The Spanish Health Ministry insisted that Coke products manufactured in Spain were safe to drink, but the regional actions suggest that officials are not convinced that the problems in Belgium have been eliminated. Meanwhile, Bloomberg also cited reports that the original illness among Belgian schoolchildren who drank Coke might have been caused by some other food contamination or something other than the defective carbon dioxide cited by Coke.</p>
        <p>On Monday, the Belgian Government, already skittish after a dioxin scare over animal feed helped defeat the Prime Minister last weekend, ordered Coca-Cola to recall all its products. More than 50 people, including 31 schoolchildren, had complained of headaches, nausea and vomiting after drinking Coke the previous week. The company said soon afterward that it had traced the problems to two bottling plants, one in Antwerp and the other in Dunkirk, France.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, the Government of Luxembourg imposed its own ban, and health officials in France told Coke to recall all canned soft drinks produced in Dunkirk. The Netherlands also ordered a recall of any Coke products that had been distributed through Belgium.</p>
        <p>Belgium and France have lifted the ban on most Coke products but not on Coca-Cola, Sprite and Fanta -- the company's biggest sellers. France has also asked Coke to provide more data that flawed carbon dioxide caused the problems at the Antwerp plant and that a substance on wooden pallets used to transport cans of Coke was at fault in the bottling plant in Dunkirk, whose products show up across Europe.</p>
        <p>Rob Baskin, a spokesman for Coca-Cola in Atlanta, its home base, said research by the company ''indicates that consumers understand the situation and are acting far less irrationally than some of the press reports might seem to indicate.'' He added that products made in Belgium were rarely shipped to Spain.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldman of Merrill Lynch said: ''You want things pan-European, but clearly there's a downside. The good news is, the products go all over. The bad news is, the products go all over.''</p>
        <p>Absent reports of serious illness, Coke's biggest problem becomes isolating the public relations damage. ''Their worry is image, and a spillover to other countries,'' Mr. Goldman said. ''More than anything, the company needs to make sure people view this as an aberration.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Baskin said some of the recalled cans and bottles were being destroyed. ''There are some markets where we've been asked to take product off the shelf and destroy it, and that's what we're doing,'' he said. ''In other markets, we've been asked not to ship product.'' He said he did not know which policy was in practice in which markets. He added that the company would reimburse anyone whose doctor indicated that an illness was caused by drinking Coca-Cola. He said he did not know if anyone had been reimbursed.</p>
        <p>Coca-Cola Enterprises, the giant Coke bottler that controls production in Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands as well as most of France, has been noticeably silent. Several telephone messages left for a company spokeswoman at the Atlanta headquarters were not returned this week, and statements have been almost entirely limited to Coca-Cola employees.</p>
        <p>Perhaps signaling a shift, Dominique Reineiche, the president of the bottler's French unit, held a news conference yesterday in Paris. ''We still haven't estimated the cost to us in lost sales, but it will be considerable,'' Ms. Reineiche said, according to The Associated Press.</p>
        <p>Coca-Cola Enterprises, spun off as a public company in 1986, is about 40 percent owned by Coca-Cola and has been acquiring bottlers rapidly in recent years. Coca-Cola makes the concentrate that is used to make soft drinks, but the drinks are produced and distributed by Coca-Cola Enterprises and other bottlers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baskin, the Coke spokesman, said he could not comment on what Coca-Cola Enterprises was doing. But he noted that ''it's one system, and the trademarks are the property of the Coca-Cola Company.''</p>
        <p>Several analysts said it was appropriate for Coca-Cola to take the lead in managing the crisis. ''You have to come out with one voice for the Coke system,'' said Bill Pecoriello of Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>Still, there may have been an early breakdown in communications between the two companies that caused a delay in the corporate response.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, shares of Coca-Cola fell $1.125, to $63.4375, and shares of Coca-Cola Enterprises slipped $1.25, to $32.125.</p>
        <p>Coca-Cola Enterprises will bear the brunt of expenses associated with the recall. ''They have indicated there will be charges against earnings,'' Mr. Goldman said, adding that he did not know the amount. Coca-Cola's earnings are unlikely to be affected unless the ban is prolonged.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pecoriello said Coca-Cola would have to move into high marketing gear once its products are for sale everywhere again. ''The business is still very seasonal in Europe, but this is the peak season,'' he said. ''These are very important months for the company.''</p>
