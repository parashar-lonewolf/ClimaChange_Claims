        <p>ON the white-sand beach fringed with pampas grass, two women are walking to the water's edge. One is wearing the archetypal St.-Tropez thong -- a bikini G-string revealing breasts, back and buttocks tanned nut brown from the sun.

        <p>ON the white-sand beach fringed with pampas grass, two women are walking to the water's edge.

        <p>Has the tide now turned on bare-it-all beach wear? The latest swimwear fashions are all about covering up: for the mass market, aerodynamically designed suits with athletic torsos and streamlined legs; nostalgic Coney Island frivolity with underwired cups and flirty skirts from Norma Kamali; haute couture's re-creations of silver-screen glamour -- all padded bras and cantilevered curves. In his latest cruise collection for Chanel, Karl Lagerfeld showed swimsuits layered with sweater sets. From the avant-garde designers come black, long-legged suits not so far from those of the early bathing belles of the last century.</p>
        <p>The reality in St.-Tropez today is that bronzed and brazen bodies are still offered up to the sun. The bikini may have been ousted in favor of the one-piece bathing suit, but sun seekers still roll down feather-light Lycra to the hips as they splay out on the beach. Even if the Beautiful People have long since retreated, at the portside cafes Le Gorille or Senequier, the bare midriffs, peek-a-boo broderie anglaise and espadrilles all recall the early-1960's heyday of St.-Tropez.</p>
        <p>Yet much has happened in the 37 years since Brigitte Bardot crawled from the sea in "And God Created Woman" and a sleepy Mediterranean fishing port invented for the world the sun-sea-sex vacation.</p>
        <p>The freedom of flesh and spirit symbolized by half-naked bodies romping on the shore has now lost its innocence. Skin cancer hangs like a baleful black cloud on the not-so-distant horizon. (In southern England, health workers patrol beaches toting sunscreen sprays.) Along the French Riviera this summer, the darker side of the sexual revolution has already washed up: free condoms are being distributed on beaches as part of an anti-AIDS project, and municipal beachcombers make a daily trawl for drug syringes buried in the sand. Meanwhile, in the cities, wearing a revealing swimsuit might seem a siren-lure for the sexual harassment that has surfaced in New York's swimming pools.</p>
        <p>So exposure has become an issue. It is as if the sexy stretch outfits, the bras, corsets and carelessly revealed flesh of the 1980's reached a flood tide that is now on the ebb. Faced with the sexpot supermodels and the cult of body consciousness, women have begun to stage a silent revolt, offering passive resistance to the concept that if you've got it, you have to flaunt it. Significantly, on the beaches as on the streets, some of the youngest and prettiest women (who were once the only ones who dared to bare) seem to have decided that exposure is over.</p>
        <p>Undress for the beach in the scanties that were normally reserved for the bedroom was part of the allure of the sunshine vacation when it became a mass migration in the 1960's. Now the gingham-frilled bra and panties and the itsy-bitsy-teeny-weeny-yellow-polka-dot bikini seem to represent a skittish femininity from which modern women recoil. Although fashion magazines, under the spell of the 1970's, are trying to revive the tiny two-piece, those now wearing bikinis in St.-Tropez are the honed-in-the-gym older women with leathery hides or fair-skinned Nordic tourists dying for a tan.</p>
        <p>The most obvious impetus for covering up is practical. In beauty magazines, safe sun, as well as safe sex, is the latest fashion. Instead of extolling the glamour of a tan, the glossies promote products with high sun-protection factors. Fears about the ozone layer have undermined the romantic vision of F. Scott Fitzgerald's Riviera in "Tender is the Night," where Nicole Diver lay on the beach and "her back, a ruddy orange brown, set off by a string of creamy pearls, shone in the sun."</p>
        <p>Coco Chanel, with her sunburned face and sporty clothes, started the fashion for tanning, which became a tribal rite of the yacht and jet sets until mass travel enabled everyone to fly off on summer vacations and the tan lost its snob value. With hindsight, the 1920's concept of "going native" now seems class-ridden, patronizing, even uncomfortably racist. In his fashion memoir "The Glass of Fashion," Cecil Beaton described Baba, the Princesse de Faucingy-Lucinge, as "looking rather like an Arab urchin." Playing up her dusky skin, the socialite "would wear a tarboosh, or pillbox monkey hats, and pinned bunches of jeweled grapes to her bathing suit."</p>
        <p>The high-water mark of exposure was the topless swimsuit introduced by the designer Rudi Gernreich in 1964. The swimsuit, suspended from two halter straps in the cleavage of bared breasts, brought out all the Puritan fury and fervor of Americans, who have never accepted it for the beach (although allowing the sexes equal exposure above the waist has periodically been raised as a feminist issue).</p>
        <p>Peggy Moffitt, the original model for the infamous suit, said it was a logical evolution of Gernreich's avant-garde ideas in swimwear design as much as a scandalous symbol of the Permissive Society.</p>
        <p>"It was prophetic," said Ms. Moffitt, who now lives in California with her husband, the fashion photographer William Claxton. "It had to do with more than what to wear to the beach. It was about a changing culture throughout all society, about freedom and emancipation. It was also a reaction against something particularly American: the little boy snickering that women had breasts."</p>
        <p>Woman on the beach as sex object has been part of the evolution of swimwear. The Cannes Film Festival, held on the French Riviera each May, is a reminder of the days when a starlet was as big as her swimsuit was brief. Esther Williams, Betty Grable, Marilyn Monroe and Brigitte Bardot all used the swimsuit as a career prop to their sex appeal, and when Madonna made an appearance at Cannes in 1991 in pointed bra and corset, she was tilting at a sexist society.</p>
        <p>As the wave of female sexuality on the beach recedes, the peacock male has become the new sex symbol, as in Gianni Versace's ads with their heroic depictions of Miami bathers. Swimsuits shown in recent men's wear collections by Giorgio Armani, Dolce &amp; Gabbana or Paul Smith have tended to be black and snug fitting, throwbacks to the designs of the 1930's and '40s. They are in contrast to popular, sports-inspired beach wear: bright and baggy Bermudas or boxer shorts.</p>
        <p>The Greek designer Nikos Apostolopoulos put a different spin on the collection he showed during the July French men's wear shows. His bathing suits (for both sexes, but with the focus on the male) are anatomical creations, cut and stitched to outline the body and its sexual characteristics.</p>
        <p>"A lot of people who are doing underwear and swimwear either make it very serious, or make a man look like a gay," he said. "My symbol is a real man, the Greek man, who went to bed with a woman or a man and was free -- a man who developed his intelligence and his body."</p>
        <p>Ancient Greece of 2,500 years ago was the last period, before this century, when men (and even women) were willing to put their healthy minds and healthy bodies on display. The 20th century, from the days of Edwardian bathing machine onward, can be seen as a struggle to recreate an era when bared flesh was no longer associated with shame and sin. But having at last found a place in the sun, it may now be time to seek out the shade.</p>
