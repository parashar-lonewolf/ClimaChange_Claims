        <p>LEAD: VIRTUALLY all the carbon dioxide emitted by power plants to be built in the next decade could be absorbed by 10 million acres of new forest, according to the Environmental Defense Fund. The organization has proposed that such planting be undertaken by the Federal Conservation Reserve Program, a project of the Department of Agriculture.</p>
        <p>VIRTUALLY all the carbon dioxide emitted by power plants to be built in the next decade could be absorbed by 10 million acres of new forest, according to the Environmental Defense Fund. The organization has proposed that such planting be undertaken by the Federal Conservation Reserve Program, a project of the Department of Agriculture.</p>
        <p>The trees would absorb as much carbon dioxide as would be produced by the burning of fossil fuels in the power plants. The gas collects in the atmosphere, where it traps heat like the glass in a greenhouse. Many scientists believe this ''greenhouse effect'' is contributing to global warming.</p>
        <p>Daniel J. Dudek, author of the proposal, described it yesterday to the Senate Energy Committee, which began two days of hearings on the role of forests in controlling carbon dioxide in the air.</p>
        <p>Discussing the role of trees in soaking up and storing carbon dioxide, Senator Timothy E. Wirth, the Colorado Democrat who is chairman of the committee, said yesterday that about 27 million acres of tropical rain forests are being destroyed each year. Combustion or rotting of this forest material puts even more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>The Conservation Reserve Program encourages farmers to rent cropland to the Government for 10 years. The land is then planted in trees and other noncrop vegetation. Land particularly susceptible to erosion is chosen and the program is also designed to reduce overproduction of crops.</p>
        <p>Under the proposal, the annual Government compensation would be substantially increased by funds assessed from utilities building new power plants. This assessment would encourage utilities to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dudek said it was originally hoped, under the Conservation Reserve Program, that by 1990 farmers would have rented to the Government 40 million to 45 million acres from the 469 acres now producing crops. Less than one quarter of this goal has been achieved, he reported.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, his report said, while Congress proposed that 12.5 percent of the replanted acreage be in forests, less than one-third of that amount has been planted in trees.</p>
        <p>Replanting 10 million acres as forest would cost $1 billion to $2 billion, Mr. Dudek said, but it would still be ''the most cost-effective option'' to reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</p>
