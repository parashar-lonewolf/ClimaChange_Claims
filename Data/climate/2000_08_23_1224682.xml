        <p>The 19th century's dream of an open polar sea has become the 21st century's nightmare.</p>
        <p>Last weekend's news that an icebreaker arriving at the North Pole had found open water instead of ice means that the fantasies of 19th century explorers are now a reality -- one with potentially dire implications for the environment. A hundred and fifty years ago, such a discovery would have been a cause for celebration. In 1853, for example, the American explorer Elisha Kent Kane sailed north to Greenland, determined to find an open polar sea and with it a shortcut to China. The details of his journey inspired Jules Verne's novel of 1866, ''At the North Pole.''</p>

        <p>Last weekend's news that an icebreaker arriving at the North Pole had found open water instead of ice means that the fantasies of 19th century explorers are now a reality -- one with potentially dire implications for the environment. A hundred and fifty years ago, such a discovery would have been a cause for celebration. In 1853, for example, the American explorer Elisha Kent Kane sailed north to Greenland, determined to find an open polar sea and with it a shortcut to China. The details of his journey inspired Jules Verne's novel of 1866, ''At the North Pole.''</p>
        <p>Were pioneering arctic explorers like Elisha Kent Kane crazy? Didn't they know the North was frozen? Sure, they knew that the Arctic was frozen; whaling ships had been hunting in Baffin Bay for centuries, and sailors had seen the ice packs. But no one had yet been to the North Pole. The explorers were hopeful that, like a lake whose shores are frozen but whose middle is not, the Arctic Ocean might contain open water at its center.</p>
        <p>The 19th century's optimism about finding a Northwest Passage through the pole was founded on ignorance about climate change. In 1837, when the Swiss naturalist Louis Agassiz proposed that much of the geology of northern Europe was the result of a geologically recent Ice Age, he was greeted with shock and disbelief. To his contemporaries, the idea of a glacier extending from the Arctic to the Alps was inconceivable, as were the cold temperatures necessary to sustain it.</p>
        <p>Today, optimism and ignorance have again gotten in the way of understanding, this time in the debates over global warming. The evidence of accumulating greenhouse gases in the earth's atmosphere is indisputable, but optimists have insisted that this change does not necessarily bode ill for the climate. Meanwhile, hard-nosed experts have had to admit that they do not know enough to predict precisely how global warming will affect life on earth.</p>
        <p>Yet the broad implications are clear enough. A temperature increase great enough to melt the northern icecap means a massive reorganization of the earth's heat and water patterns. Some places that have been able to support millions of inhabitants may in the future be able to support only thousands. Some formerly uninhabitable areas may eventually become suitable for farms and cities, but settling and developing those areas will take generations.</p>
        <p>Inevitably, many people resist the notion that such a brutal future is possible. The Rev. Jerry Falwell recently said on late-night TV's ''Politically Incorrect'' that he thought global warming was nonsense. Of course, he does not believe in evolution or the Big Bang either, but he expresses an optimism about Providence that many share.</p>
        <p>General acceptance of the Ice Age began only when Elisha Kent Kane returned from his ill-fated search. He published a richly illustrated account of his experience that enabled people to understand for the first time what arctic ice was like. His discovery and account of the Humboldt Glacier, the world's largest, astonished and impressed the world. Modern Greenland became a popular metaphor for the old Ice Age.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the recent photographs of the open waters at the North Pole will do the same for global warming. They show clearly and unmistakably what so many experts had once thought impossible. For the first time in 50 million years, we now have an open polar sea.</p>
