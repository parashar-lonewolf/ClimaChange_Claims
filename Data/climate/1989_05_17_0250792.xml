        <p>LEAD: Experimental vehicles that burn methanol instead of gasoline or diesel fuel as a way of reducing automobile air pollution are turning up around the country with increasing frequency. But engineers are finding that the alternative fuel potentially creates as many problems as it solves.</p>
        <p>Experimental vehicles that burn methanol instead of gasoline or diesel fuel as a way of reducing automobile air pollution are turning up around the country with increasing frequency. But engineers are finding that the alternative fuel potentially creates as many problems as it solves.</p>
        <p>Methanol has important advantages: very high octane, low production of particulate pollution, and a chemical composition that permits it to be made from coal. And cars to use it can be produced with relatively small changes in gasoline engine technology.</p>
        <p>But tests also disclose that as it burns, methanol produces formaldehyde and has a tendency to eat through fuel tanks, fuel pumps, and other auto parts not made of stainless steel. Should methanol catch on, the nation would probably have to depend on foreign sources for it, unless the price of oil and natural gas rose high enough to permit the competitive conversion of coal to methanol.</p>
        <p>Listing the pollution problems, Eric A. Goldstein, an attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, said, ''It sounds almost dooming.'' His group helped bring a group of experimental methanol buses to New York as part of the settlement of a lawsuit with the General Motors Corporation concerning emission controls on gasoline automobiles. ''But it would be premature to conclude that the methanol concept won't work,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He said additional research was needed on catalytic converters. Those now in use were designed to control pollution from burning gasoline, not methanol.</p>
        <p>Many of the experimental methanol vehicles are the result of General Motors' enthusiasm for the idea.</p>
        <p>For example, G.M. supplied Chevy Corsicas to 15 universities for conversion to methanol so that they could compete in an 1,100-mile marathon from Detroit through Toronto and New York to Washington earlier this month. Conversion problems and fuel economy were the focus of the race.</p>
        <p>In addition, The Triboro Coach Corporation is running six methanol-powered buses supplied by General Motors on New York City routes. And G.M. has just shipped the first dozen of 2,200 methanol cars to the state government in California.</p>
        <p>The chairman of G.M., Roger B. Smith, believes that the use of alternatives to gasoline and diesel fuel is likely in the next few years because of concern about pollution and energy imports. ''Our role is to learn to use all kinds of fuels, and see what the energy companies want to do,'' said Mr. Smith when the Corsica marathon stopped in New York.</p>
        <p>The marathon, in which teams of engineering students from the universities not only converted the cars but also made a variety of other improvements, showed engineers some new ideas for using methanol. But it also underlined continuing problems.</p>
        <p>''The emissions problem on methanol is not better or worse, just different,'' said Donald L. Runkle, a G.M. vice president in charge of the advanced engineering staff. The formaldehyde emissions react with sunlight to make smog, he said, and the manufacture of methanol as a fuel makes carbon dioxide, a gas believed to contribute to global warming.</p>
        <p>But it has been found that the buses being tested by Triboro Coach in New York emit lower levels of particulates and nitrogen oxides than diesel buses do, but a higher level of hydrocarbons, formaldehyde and carbon monoxide.</p>
        <p>Methanol's backers say it can be made to burn more cleanly if the engines are specifically designed for methanol.</p>
        <p>At the Environmental Protection Agency, Charles L. Gray, director of the emission control technology division, said methanol could burn more cleanly if mixed with large amounts of air. Gasoline engines cannot run with such a rich air mixture, so engines converted to methanol do not allow optimum combustion conditions.</p>
        <p>But even in a converted engine, methanol produces less hydrocarbon and oxides of nitrogen than gasoline does. Methanol, or methyl alcohol, is closely related to methane, or natural gas, and to ethyl alcohol, which can be used for fuel or for cocktails.</p>
        <p>Another problem in Southern California and many other urban areas is fumes from unburned gasoline that react with sunlight to form ozone. A major advantage for methanol, Mr. Gray said, is that if it evaporates before it burns it does not readily join such reactions. He predicted that methanol cars could bring an ozone reduction of 25 to 40 percent for most cities.</p>
        <p>But conversion is complicated. About 200 students from the 15 universities received kits from General Motors to make essential modifications, like replacing the carbon-steel gas tanks with stainless steel.</p>
        <p>The students also used imagination. Methanol, like gasoline, is burned as a vapor, but unlike gasoline, does not go from the liquid to the vapor state easily, especially in cold weather. The Rochester Institute of Technology team borrowed parts from an ultrasonic humidifier to help that process. At the Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne, students put their Corsica in a giant refrigerator to test for cold-weather problems.</p>
        <p>Chasing $20,000 in prizes, many teams souped up 2.8-liter engines to run at compression ratios more typical of race cars to take advantage of methanol's high octane of 110.</p>
        <p>With a more powerful engine that resulted from the increased octane, some students found they could take apart the transmission and modify it so the engine could run efficiently at lower speeds. Others tried ceramic parts to retain heat in the engine for higher efficiency. Molybdenum coatings on internal engine parts were used to cut friction between internal moving parts.</p>
        <p>The Florida Tech team modified the six-cylinder engine so that at highway speeds three cylinders shut down, saving fuel. General Motors tried that approach a few years ago on gasoline cars, but could not make it work.</p>
        <p>Methanol also poses some safety problems. It is poisonous but odorless, making leaks hard to detect, and burns with invisible flames. So for the marathon, it was mixed in an 85-15 blend of methanol and unleaded gasoline. Other components were added to give extra smell and color.</p>
        <p>Another problem is methanol's lower energy density - the amount of energy per unit volume. A gallon of methanol has only a little more than half the energy of gasoline - 65,000 B.T.U.'s, compared with 116,000 B.T.U.'s. The cars require more frequent refueling or larger fuel tanks. Engineers would like to build a composite tank to make better use of the space in nooks and crannies under the car, but they have not yet developed a material that methanol cannot dissolve.</p>
        <p>The greatest long-term advantage of methanol is that it can be made from coal, which is more easily found in this country than crude oil.</p>
        <p>At present, most methanol is made from natural gas because the cost of manufacture is far less than making it from coal. Coal-derived methanol would not be competitive with gasoline or diesel fuel until the price of a barrel of oil rose to $30 or $40 from the current $20.</p>
        <p>While oil prices are low, methanol will be made from natural gas. But natural gas in this country is almost as expensive as oil. If methanol were to be developed as a fuel, the natural gas would probably come from the Middle East, where prices are much lower. But this would make the methanol supply, like much of the present gasoline supply, dependent on foreign sources.</p>
