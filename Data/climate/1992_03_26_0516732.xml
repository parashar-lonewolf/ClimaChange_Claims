        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"Even as leading scientists warn that America's educational system is failing to produce scientists fast enough to fill a glaring projected shortage, many young physicists contend that universities are already turning out more physicists than there are permanent jobs" (Science Times, March 10). The lone voice of optimism you quote is Leon M. Lederman's. The Nobel-prize physicist, president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, believes physicists will "star in the quest for alternative energy sources and many other social needs."</p>
        <p>I wish I shared his optimism. I am completing a doctorate in physics from Dr. Lederman's home institution, the University of Chicago, specializing in solar energy. I received an alternative-energy fellowship for work your newspaper wrote about in 1990 and that has even found its way into an introductory physics textbook. Moreover, as a former member of the board of editors of Scientific American magazine and now a contributing editor, I think it's safe to say I have more contacts than most recent physics graduates.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"Even as leading scientists warn that America's educational system is failing to produce scientists fast enough to fill a glaring projected shortage, many young physicists contend that universities are already turning out more physicists than there are permanent jobs" (Science Times, March 10). The lone voice of optimism you quote is Leon M. Lederman's. The Nobel-prize physicist, president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, believes physicists will "star in the quest for alternative energy sources and many other social needs."</p>
        <p>I wish I shared his optimism. I am completing a doctorate in physics from Dr. Lederman's home institution, the University of Chicago, specializing in solar energy. I received an alternative-energy fellowship for work your newspaper wrote about in 1990 and that has even found its way into an introductory physics textbook. Moreover, as a former member of the board of editors of Scientific American magazine and now a contributing editor, I think it's safe to say I have more contacts than most recent physics graduates.</p>
        <p>Yet I am no closer to finding a job than when I started looking six months ago. Even small, rural colleges are receiving more than 200 applications every time they advertise for a one-year replacement for a faculty member taking a sabbatical.</p>
        <p>Science education certainly needs strengthening, as Dr. Lederman advocates. But our country is already unable to make good use of its newly trained recruits. We have seen severe cuts under eight years of Reaganomics and four more under President Bush, particularly in renewable energy. I can only hope for an increase in Government support in the next few years, so the next groups of Ph.D. physicists fare better.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, while waiting, I'm getting out. DAVE COOKE Chicago, March 10, 1992</p>
