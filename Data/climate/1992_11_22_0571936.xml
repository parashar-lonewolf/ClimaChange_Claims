        <p>After an appendectomy in September, while groggily awakening from the anesthesia, Michael R. Peevey's first words in the recovery room were "Vote for Clinton-Gore."</p>
        <p>While Mr. Peevey said he has no memory of the incident, friends say it is typical of the 55-year-old who has just quit as president of the SCE Corporation, the parent of the Southern California Edison utility company. They call Mr. Peevey an anomaly in a conservative industry where most executives have engineering or financial backgrounds.</p>
        <p>Mr. Peevey got his start as a government economist. He later worked for organized labor, at a university and for an environmental advocacy group. This year, he helped organize a group of California executives who contributed to Bill Clinton's Presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>Last month, after being passed over for the chairmanship of SCE, Mr. Peevey resigned as president, effective March 1. He has been with the nation's second-largest utility since 1984 and has held the No. 2 post for two years.</p>
        <p>"It's time to go in a new direction," Mr. Peevey said last week in an interview from Rome, where he was participating in a trade mission. "Much after 55, my own drive and anyone else's interest in me would wane."</p>
        <p>Mr. Peevey declined to be specific about his future, saying only that "I've always had a strong interest in public service" and that things should be clearer "after January."</p>
        <p>That last statement, and his circumspection, may stem from talk that Mr. Peevey is being considered for Energy Secretary in the Clinton Administration. Warren M. Christopher, the Clinton transition director, is an SCE board member.</p>
        <p>"If I was asked -- and I haven't been -- I'd be flattered," Mr. Peevey said. In his tenure at Edison, Mr. Peevey has urged California utilities to rely more on renewable energy and conservation.</p>
        <p>He also was a principal catalyst behind Calstart, an unusual year-old, public-private consortium that hopes to spawn an electric vehicle industry using aerospace technology. Mr. Peevey is its chairman.</p>
        <p>Calstart's prototype vehicle will be displayed at the Los Angeles Auto Show in January.</p>
        <p>"He was the first major executive to embrace and embellish the idea," said Lon Bell, Calstart's founding president. Mr. Bell wrote to 411 aerospace firms that had technologies with automotive potential. He received 411 rejections. "I finally found a receptive audience with Mike Peevey," he said.</p>
