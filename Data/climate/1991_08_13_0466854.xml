        <p>THE woodland deer mouse, with its long tail, big ears and powder-white belly, once was so common in the cold forests of northern Michigan that trapping it for study was hardly more difficult than collecting moths and mosquitoes. Sometime in the last 20 to 40 years, though, the deer mouse all but vanished from the woods here, its range retreating north to Michigan's upper peninsula, 30 miles away.</p>
        <p>By itself, the deer mouse's disappearance would not have caused much of a stir along the shores of Douglas Lake, where the University of Michigan has maintained a 10,000-acre biological field station for most of the century. But a team of Michigan researchers has documented other striking changes in the geographic distribution of a dozen other plants and animals in this region.</p>
        <p>Ferns, fish and mammals common to the southern mixed hardwood forests of the Middle West and East are moving into northern Michigan, some of them at a pace of 10 miles annually. Meanwhile, small mammals, trees and orchid plants of the north that once were plentiful at the southern edge of their range in Michigan are rapidly slipping back into Canada, their major range.</p>
        <p>Because the research center has been collecting data for most of this century, the scientists believe the findings reflect long-term climate change, not just recent warm years that might or might not be due to global warming. Although they concede that their work does not prove the case, their study is the first formal scientific research in the United States to determine whether documented changes in species' ranges are being caused by man-made climatic change.</p>
        <p>"It's clear there is enough circumstantial evidence now that many scientists believe the causes of these range changes deserve an immediate and intensive investigation to determine whether it is related to global warming," said Dr. James A. Teeri, director of the Michigan Biological Station, who is coordinating the research team. "The real challenge is to separate possible global warming causes from other changes in land use due to human activities."</p>
        <p>Measuring changes in the geographical distribution of plants and animals is often an inexact scientific business. The ranges of organisms are fluid; plants and animals aggressively take ground when conditions are sweet and withdraw in the face of fire, disease, drought and other threats. To link such changes with global warming makes the issue even more murky.</p>
        <p>There has clearly been a warming trend in the last decade. What is at issue is the cause; it may be greenhouse gases, but scientists say it is too soon to tell. Scientists in the United States and other nations have hypothesized that the warming trend is a result of industrial and agricultural gases, chiefly carbon dioxide, methane and chlorofluorocarbons, trapping infrared energy from the earth's surface and causing the heating.</p>
        <p>Since 1870, the average temperature of the planet has risen 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit or about 1 degree Centigrade, and if a more rapid rate of increase noted over the last two decades continues, the average temperature could climb as much as 8 degrees by the end of the 21st century, some scientists say. British and American scientists said this year that 1990 was the warmest year recorded since people began measuring the planet's surface temperature. Of the 10 warmest years recorded, all have occurred since 1973. Clues in Natural Processes</p>
        <p>It is not yet known whether the warming trend is long term, a result of natural variability or a result of increased emissions of heat-trapping gases. Studies in the last year have sought to answer the question by looking at changes in natural processes.</p>
        <p>Scientists have found that the snow mantle covering the Northern Hemisphere is shrinking, that the sea ice near Greenland is thinning and that the Alaskan snow melted about two weeks earlier in the 1980's than it did in the 1940's.</p>
        <p>A study by Canadian scientists showed that the average annual temperature in a region of northwestern Ontario climbed more than 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit from the late 1960's to the mid-1980's, causing more droughts and fires and making lakes shallower and more prone to contamination. Earlier this month, scientists from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the United States Geological Survey said the ice cap in the Arctic Sea had shrunk 2 percent from 1978 to 1987.</p>
        <p>But if projections of a long-term, man-made warming trend are accurate, scientists would expect to observe its results also among plants, animals and ecological systems that are affected by minute shifts in natural conditions, especially in the colder climates of the Northern Hemisphere. This is a difficult endeavor when working with living plants and animals.</p>
        <p>Previously, ecologists have noted that the Virginia opossum is rapidly moving from its native range well into New England and northern Michigan. Armadillos, red cardinals, mockingbirds and several species of rats and mice also are moving north.</p>
        <p>But at the same time several northern species are moving south. The least weasel, for instance, is expanding out of Nebraska and into Kansas and Missouri. 'Incredible Difficulty'</p>
        <p>"Given the incredible difficulty meteorologists have had convincing people there is a global warming trend, it's going to be even more difficult to convince other scientists that the trend has had significant effects on land-animal distribution," said James H. Brown, professor of biology at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. "The problem is these changes are dynamic anyway. Even if you demonstrate a species has moved, how can you demonstrate it was caused by climate change rather than some other variable."</p>
        <p>Scientists here are seeking to do just that. The research under way in Michigan appears to be the first in the United States to test the hypothesis that global climate change is affecting biological systems and to apply rigorous methods to the work.</p>
        <p>The University of Michigan's field station here is an especially useful laboratory for such work. For more than 80 years, biologists have collected a wealth of specimens and data describing the life cycles of an ecosystem that has been largely untouched since the virgin forest was clear cut at the turn of the century.</p>
        <p>The field station also sits at the convergence of two great biological regions: the northern boreal forest of spruce, hemlock, sugar maple and birch, and the southern mixed hardwood forest of white pine, beech, aspen and red maple. A persistent change in temperature, the single most important factor in establishing the boundaries of the two great forests, would be expected to most dramatically affect the creatures living at the southern and northern edges of their ranges.</p>
        <p>By comparing the current distribution of plants and animals against those documented by previous scientists, researchers here have gained surprisingly accurate measurements of new ranges, like the new, skimpier range of the red-backed vole. A distant cousin of the woodland deer mouse, the vole is dainty enough to stand in a tablespoon, quick enough to catch darting insects, and hardy enough to survive icy winters. Now it is gone from the field station, for the second time this century.</p>
        <p>After Michigan's white pine forests were cut in the late 19th century, the vole retreated to Canada. As the forest grew back and trees matured in the 1920's, the vole proliferated again in the lower peninsula. The evidence of this is contained in the university's collections at the field station and in Ann Arbor: every specimen, and there are hundreds, has an accompanying data card documenting the date and location where it was trapped, and the statistics indicate that from 1920 to 1940, the vole was plentiful and thus popular for study. So was the woodland deer mouse.  Observing the Vole</p>
        <p>Philip Myers, a biologist, associate curator at the University of Michigan's Museum of Zoology and a member of the university's research team, was the first to notice the disappearance of the red-backed vole and the mouse. In 1985, he began laying traps at the field station in the same places as his predecessors. Since then he caught one vole and no deer mice.</p>
        <p>"Both of these creatures are common to the northern forests and you'd expect that the habitat is better now, since the forests are 90 years old, than it was 50 or 60 years ago," said Dr. Myers. "But something is interfering and one explanation is that the habitat is changing because of global warming."</p>
        <p>Another member of the team, Dr. Gerald R. Smith, a curator of fish in the Museum of Zoology, is mapping the movement of southern-climate fish into Michigan. The orange spotted sunfish is common in small streams and ponds from the Gulf of Mexico to Ohio. It had never been seen in Michigan until the late 1950's and early 1960's.</p>
        <p>The sunfish is now as far north as the Saline River just south of Ann Arbor, said Dr. Smith, and is moving quite rapidly because winters have been milder.</p>
        <p>Two northern fish that were once common in Michigan no longer are. The finescale dace, a minnow that thrives in cold water, was first described in the 19th century by Edward Drinker Cope, a renowned naturalist, as existing as far south as a lake in southeastern Michigan. The dace is extinct further south than Saginaw in central Michigan, 100 miles northwest of where it was first situated.</p>
        <p>The grayling, a sport fish that is a relative of the trout, was common on Michigan's northern peninsula as far south as the Au Sable River near the town of Grayling, and its range expanded north to the Arctic. Graylings have been extinct from Michigan for 50 years, said Dr. Smith.</p>
        <p>"There are other explanations for what we've found," he said. "The forests were cut here, and that causes siltation in streams. Agricultural plowing and chemical use may be a factor. The grayling was a sport fish and people caught them by the hundreds. But I would argue that can't be the explanation. The finescale dace retracted its range at the same time as the grayling and nobody was fishing for it. Rising temperature keeps coming back as an explanation."</p>
        <p>Plants, too, appear to be responding to warming conditions. The ebony spleenwort, a species of fern common throughout the South and the East, was rarely seen in Michigan and only in the southernmost portion until the middle part of the century. In the 1960's, botanists began to find colonies as far north as the Upper Peninsula. Now it is common throughout Michigan and has a consistent range limit 300 miles north of where it used to be in the 1950's.</p>
        <p>Dr. Anton A. Reznicek, a botanist and associate curator of the university's plant collection, has also found striking changes in the range of the calypso orchid, a native northern flower not commonly found in boreal forests. In Michigan, the orchid was found in cedar swamps and cedar forests as far south as central Michigan. The university's field station here, more than 100 miles north, is now at the plant's southern limit.</p>
