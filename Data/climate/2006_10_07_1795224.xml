        <p>Though he's just 10, Qaasim Asani Malik Seawright Middleton has already mastered a variety of drums as colorful and multifaceted as the name he insists on using when he performs. There is the goat-skin-covered djembe from West Africa, played with bare hands, and its cow-skinned cousin, the dunumba, played with two sticks. There is the kenkeni, a double-sided bass drum from Mali, and his favorites, the tablas, whose fragile clay heads require a deft touch.

        <p>Though he's just 10, Qaasim Asani Malik Seawright Middleton has already mastered a variety of drums as colorful and multifaceted as the name he insists on using when he performs. There is the goat-skin-covered djembe from West Africa, played with bare hands, and its cow-skinned cousin, the dunumba, played with two sticks. There is the kenkeni, a double-sided bass drum from Mali, and his favorites, the tablas, whose fragile clay heads require a deft touch. And then there is every noisy boy's dream come true: the traps.</p>
        <p>But on a breezy afternoon at a playground in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn, Qaasim was channeling an irrepressible enthusiasm for finding rhythm into just about anything but an actual instrument -- the talent that landed him in the documentary ''The Music in Me: Children's Recitals From Classical to Latin, Jazz to Zydeco.'' The film will be shown tonight on HBO, and will be rebroadcast throughout the month on HBO Family.</p>
        <p>''I can make music on anything, actually,'' Qaasim said, then proved it. His loose limbs and long dreadlocks flying, he ran to a schoolyard fence and, with a stick, turned it into a makeshift xylophone. The metal ramp on a jungle gym became cymbals or a gong, depending on how his feet hit it. A sampling of his mother's laughter was transformed into a rapper's sound effects.</p>
        <p>''Music,'' he said, opening his arms to the world around him, ''is everywhere.''</p>
        <p>It is also available to almost every child, regardless of class or culture, as Qaasim and the other deliriously talented youngsters demonstrate in this half-hour music documentary for the 7-to-11 set -- the first of three music programs HBO has planned for the coming year.</p>
        <p>Focusing on six small-but-mighty masters of their musical domain, ''The Music in Me'' is at once cheerfully hopeful and downright awe-inspiring. Nathan Chan, an 11-year-old cellist, performs Saint-Saëns's ''Swan'' so plaintively that it calls to mind the human voice. Ten-year-old Elena Pinderhughes throws her flute, body and soul into Latin jazz. Guyland Leday, a 7-year-old Louisianan, plays zydeco accordion like a boy possessed.</p>
        <p>Úna Rose, an 11-year-old rock guitarist, uses her music to wage war against global warming. Tyler Lindsay, at 10, blows his trumpet in his family's brass band and on street corners, where he hawks his real passion: jazz. And Qaasim creates an urban symphony as he raps his drumsticks on everything from a metal gate to a fire hydrant.</p>
        <p>''I thought that television really had a deficit in musical education, but I didn't want to do anything 'educational,' and I didn't want any of that synchronized, cutesy music that you hear in children's videos,'' said Sheila Nevins, president of HBO Documentary and Family. ''We were trying to find a way to bring classical music to kids without using child prodigies. We wanted to use dignified, strong music and bring it to everyone.''</p>
        <p>She discovered the perfect partner in Leslie Stifelman, a classical pianist and conductor and the musical director of ''Chicago'' on Broadway, who had been clamoring to bring to television her experiences of taking music to underprivileged children. Ms. Stifelman began by persuading music schools and organizations around the country to spread the word, after which children were asked to submit videos of themselves performing and answering questions like ''What's your favorite sound?'' and ''What do you feel when you play?''</p>
        <p>''We were asking them to present the story of their life through music,'' Ms. Stifelman said.</p>
        <p>The results were breathtaking, she added, not only in the number of children who submitted entries -- more than 500 -- but also in the scope of genres and styles they played.</p>
        <p>''The point was not to find the out-of-tune high school band but rather kids who were talented and approachable and inspiring,'' Ms. Nevins said. ''We wanted to find young musicians that parents could love and children would not be intimidated by, but who could electrify young people and give them permission to make their own sounds.''</p>
        <p>The parent part is important, as ''The Music in Me'' makes clear. Almost all of the children come from families in which music is recognized as an integral component of a rounded education, and almost all would seem to confirm the theory that music bolsters math and language comprehension, and sets its participants on a road to success.</p>
        <p>Take Tyler, who was 2 when his father, a trumpeter, and his mother, a French horn player, held a mouthpiece to his tiny lips. By the time he was 3, they were helping him hold a trumpet and homeschooling him in languages, physical fitness and Lego building for spatial creativity.</p>
        <p>And then there is Qaasim, whose father, Keith Middleton, a cast member of the Broadway rhythm show ''Stomp,'' exposed his baby son to the art of finding music in everyday objects, and whose mother, Toni Seawright, the first black Miss Mississippi, nurtured her son's singing, dancing, acting and academic abilities so well that he jumped ahead in school.</p>
        <p>It apparently paid off: Qaasim won a starring role in ''The Naked Brothers Band,'' a new Nickelodeon series to be broadcast in January. He's the guitarist, working with an instrument he had down cold by Week 3.</p>
        <p>For the children in ''The Music in Me,'' you sense that music is a saving grace in lives that without it might not resonate quite so vibrantly.</p>
        <p>Or, as Nathan put it when asked where he would be without music, ''Oh, man.'' He let out an enormous sigh. ''I'd be just a sore bum. I'd be a total geek and nerd if I didn't have music in my life.'' He thought for a moment. ''I think that's the only thing that's special about me.''</p>
