        <p>GIVEN our tight economy, heightened national security concerns and renewed anxiety about our supply of oil, it's time that we in the Northeast became serious about conserving electricity. Conservation is a meaningful act, just when many of us are looking for something of lasting good to do for our country. Investment in more efficient electrical equipment in our homes, offices and factories benefits us, individually and collectively, for the long term.</p>
        <p>In fact, few individual acts could be more in our long-term national interest. Though oil prices have dropped 30 percent over the past several months, we all know the saving is temporary. With oil prices, what goes down, goes up. By contrast, the payoff for investing in more efficient lighting and in heating and cooling equipment is permanent.</p>
        <p>First, let's see what investment in saving electricity does for the pocketbook. Let's assume that all of us from Virginia to Massachusetts -- homeowners, businesspeople and factory managers -- modernized our lighting and heating and cooling systems. Based on real experience, we each would immediately cut our electric bills an average of 25 percent. At that rate we'd recoup any investments within two years from lower electric bills -- or sooner still with utility and state rebates factored in. For the region as a whole, the aggregate annual saving would be measured in the hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
        <p>Reducing electrical use by that same 25 percent in each home, office and plant would cut regional power consumption by a whopping 133 million kilowatt hours. That could be enough to enable us to shut down dozens of power plants and cut our oil imports from Saudi Arabia by more than half. Greater energy self-sufficiency translates directly to greater national security and maneuvering room in global diplomacy.</p>
        <p>Another winner is the environment. That same 25 percent regional saving in electricity would reduce sulfur and other emissions by thousands of tons a year as well, easing the global warming threat and improving the air we breathe.</p>
        <p>Too often we nod approvingly at new rebate programs for investing in energy-saving lighting but don't take advantage of them. We perk up at news of a new more energy-efficient heater or air-conditioner, but we don't pursue it. It is estimated that 90 percent of the Northeast Corridor's homeowners and 70 percent of its businesses could very readily achieve that 25 percent saving simply by taking action.</p>
        <p>Rebate offers are better than ever right now, and the paperwork is simple, sometimes even nonexistent.  Some large contractors will give a rebate up front and collect from utilities or states themselves. Couple state or utility rebates with the variety of deals available from responsible contractors, and modernization can wind up costing nothing.</p>
        <p>Municipalities and parking garages can benefit too. At 8 watts apiece rather than 68, LED bulbs in traffic lights save our cities $1,200 a year over incandescent bulbs per intersection. They'll also last 10 times longer, reducing accidents caused by burned-out traffic signals or changing bulbs at rush hour. ''Energy harvesting'' controls in parking garages turn lights off during daylight and on at dusk. Occupancy sensors turn on the lights only when people are using the space.</p>
        <p>The United States remains the biggest electricity consumer in the world, and we depend on that electricity for our prosperity and standard of living. Every kilowatt we conserve reduces our vulnerability to a California-type scenario right here.  The Atlantic Corridor from Virginia to Massachusetts accounts for 16 percent of nation's energy consumption, and about as much as all of Europe and South America combined.</p>
        <p>The United States imports about 40 percent of the oil necessary to generate electricity. Unfortunately as we have learned recently, much of that oil comes from countries that may not be the steadfast suppliers we once believed them to be.</p>
        <p>Utilities or electrical contractors will gladly provide a free survey and recommendations. Even in the unlikely event that none of your electrical equipment needs modernizing, they can make present equipment run better longer. That in itself would likely cut your energy bill by 5 percent or more.</p>
        <p>When's the best time to modernize? It's best to get it done before next summer's cooling season, when electrical demand peaks.</p>
        <p>Electric power conservation is the right thing to do, and the right time to do it is now.</p>
