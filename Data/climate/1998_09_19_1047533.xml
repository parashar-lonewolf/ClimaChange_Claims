        <p>Setting a figure for the first time on its planned reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the British Petroleum Company announced today a ''firm overall target'' to cut emissions by 10 percent of their 1990 levels by 2010.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the company in London, Roddy Kennedy, said the 1990 level of emissions was 40 million tons -- a figure that would have risen by 18 million tons over the next 12 years if no measures were taken to reduce them.</p>

        <p>Setting a figure for the first time on its planned reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the British Petroleum Company announced today a ''firm overall target'' to cut emissions by 10 percent of their 1990 levels by 2010.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the company in London, Roddy Kennedy, said the 1990 level of emissions was 40 million tons -- a figure that would have risen by 18 million tons over the next 12 years if no measures were taken to reduce them.</p>
        <p>The target reduction was announced in a speech to the Yale School of Management in New Haven by Sir John Browne, British Petroleum's chief executive, who said the promised cuts went deeper than those promised by industrialized countries last year. Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide and other pollutants that many think cause global warming.</p>
        <p>Last December, 160 countries agreed in Kyoto, Japan, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in industrialized countries by 5 percent between 2008 and 2012. But, according to environmentalists, the agreement has met with strong resistance from oil and other companies and has not been ratified. Many people in the United States energy sector argue that global warming is unproved. Breaking ranks with other oil producers, however, Sir John first called for action to limit greenhouse gases last year, pledging to set a target for reductions. He said today that the company would undertake the cuts ''in transparent ways so the reduction can be measured and verified by outside observers.''</p>
        <p>''For the oil and gas industry, the dominant issue of public policy is climate change,'' Sir John said, according to a text of his address provided here. ''Of course, the science of climate change is not proven. The science is provisional and perhaps always will be. But there is mounting evidence that the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is rising and the temperature of the earth's surface is increasing.''</p>
        <p>Accordingly, he said, B.P. has initiated an internal program enabling units within the company to trade emission rights -- a system developed with the Environmental Defense Fund, a nonprofit advocacy group in the United States, and also urged by the Kyoto conference. Trading in emission rights lets companies or countries reduce greenhouse gas emissions either by outright cuts or by trading in excess reductions made by others. In a separate statement, B.P. said a pilot trading program would link 12 of its 90 internal units accounting for about a quarter of the company's emissions.</p>
        <p>In London, Mr. Kennedy, the spokesman, declined to comment on how today's pledge would affect B.P.'s planned merger with Amoco, announced in August and still awaiting regulatory approval. Amoco has differed with B.P. on global warming, but Sir John said today that ''as our business grows, we will incorporate new activities into the base line of our calculation and into the target.''</p>
        <p>One way B.P. has begun to reduce emissions, he said, is by cutting the number of pumping stations on the Trans-Alaska pipeline and by reducing flaring -- the burning-off of waste gas -- by two-thirds. He said future reductions would come from technological advances, more efficient energy use and less flaring.</p>
        <p>Fred Krupp, the executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund, which cooperated with B.P. in setting up its emission-trading system, called today's announcement ''a really magnificent example of a corporation acting responsibly.''</p>
        <p>While B.P.'s emissions represented a small percentage of global emissions, he said, B.P. had ''set up a whole new level of expectations for other corporations within the oil and gas industry'' and had committed itself to ''do more than the Kyoto protocol requires independently of whether it ever goes into effect.''</p>
        <p>''It's small in percentage terms,'' Mr. Krupp said in a telephone interview. ''It's more significant because of its signal. I believe this changes the whole ball game.''</p>
