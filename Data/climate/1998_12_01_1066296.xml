        <p>They Drank Their Milk</p>
        <p>Got milk?</p>
        <p>Researchers in Britain have figured out a way to tell if ancient people got it, too.</p>
        <p>Until now, archeologists have had to rely on indirect evidence -- largely pictorial or written records -- that ancient cultures milked domesticated cows or goats. Ceramic vessels found in excavations often have a residue of animal fat, but because the fat has degraded there has been no way to tell whether it had come from meat or milk.</p>
        <p>But using gas chromatography,  the scientists have shown that degraded animal and milk fats have distinctive signatures related to the relative abundance of a particular carbon isotope. The researchers, reporting in a recent issue of Science, said they found evidence of milk fat in pottery shards from an Iron Age Roman site at Stanwick, England.</p>
        <p>Isotope Dates Quakes</p>
        <p>Another group of scientists is using an isotope to delve into history. But in this case the isotope is of chlorine, not carbon, and the history is of the earth's surface, not its civilizations.</p>
        <p>The scientists, from the University of Arizona and Vanderbilt University, have developed a method of dating earthquakes by measuring trace amounts of chlorine-36 isotope on exposed rock in a fault zone.</p>
        <p>Chlorine-36 is produced when the subatomic particles in cosmic rays react with surface elements on the rock. The longer the rock has been exposed, the more chlorine-36 will be produced. And because the rate of cosmic ray bombardment is predictable for any spot on earth, the approximate date that the rock was first exposed by an earthquake can be calculated.</p>
        <p>The technique, described in a recent issue of Science, works only in faults where the rock slips vertically in a quake, not horizontally (as is the case with the San  Andreas fault in California). But applying the method to a vertical fault in Montana, the researchers discovered evidence of six earthquakes, and dated them as occurring about 400, 1,700, 2600, 7,000, 20,300 and 23,800 years ago. They hope the technique can be used to provide information to help predict quakes.</p>
        <p>Sniffing Out Termites</p>
        <p>Termites, the scourge of wood-frame houses, are usually discovered through inspection, and only after they have feasted unnoticed on a beam here, a stud there, often for months or years.</p>
        <p>But scientists at Louisiana State University have come up with a way to detect their presence early on, before they cause too much structural damage. The detector makes use of a fact the researchers recently discovered about termites: they smell like moth balls.</p>
        <p>More precisely, the scientists discovered that termites produce naphthalene, an aromatic hydrocarbon that is the major component of moth balls. (Apparently the termites use the chemical for much the same reason humans do: as a defense against bugs.)</p>
        <p>The detector, now being developed, samples and analyzes the air in building walls. When it senses naphthalene, it signals the possible presence of termites.</p>
        <p>Salamander Mystery</p>
        <p>The deaths of large numbers of salamanders in Utah, Maine and North Dakota since summer have prompted United States Geological Survey officials to issue an alert asking biologists to report unusual observations of mortality or disease in the amphibians.</p>
        <p>The latest event occurred in September at a lake east of Salt Lake City, where 200 dead tiger salamanders were found. Like earlier die-offs, a virus was believed responsible.</p>
        <p>The die-offs are a concern because of recent sharp population declines among many species of amphibians around the world. Among the theories for the declines are a rise in viral, bacterial or fungal infections, increased ultraviolet exposure because of a thinning of the ozone layer and rising global temperatures.</p>
