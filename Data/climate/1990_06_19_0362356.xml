        <p>LEAD: THE costliest environmental research project ever mounted by the Federal Government is being challenged by earth scientists who fear that it will compromise and distort the collection of data that are critically important to understanding how the global environment is changing.</p>
        <p>THE costliest environmental research project ever mounted by the Federal Government is being challenged by earth scientists who fear that it will compromise and distort the collection of data that are critically important to understanding how the global environment is changing.</p>
        <p>The project is the Earth Observing System, an elaborate array of six 15-ton satellites, remote sensors and new data-handling systems being planned by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to help learn how the global environment functions and how it is being altered by human activity.</p>
        <p>The $30 billion, 30-year enterprise, called Eos for short, is second in cost only to NASA's space station among the big science projects on which the Government is now embarking. As the centerpiece of the space agency's program called Mission to Planet Earth, it calls for the launching of unmanned spacecraft, the first of them in 1998, to study the Earth much as they study other planets in the solar system.</p>
        <p>The goal is to use the satellite measurements to help make more precise and reliable forecasts about climatic and environmental change. Scientists hope that the information from Eos will help answer such important questions as whether, how much and how fast the global climate is warming; how global warming, to whatever extent it comes, will affect different parts of the world; how ozone depletion is affecting the planet, and how forests and other natural resources are being depleted or expanded.</p>
        <p>The project has attracted broad political support, including the strong backing of President Bush.</p>
        <p>''In principle, I think it's beyond criticism,'' said John M. Logsdon, the director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University. ''We have the tools to understand the planet on an earthwide basis as a system, and that's an understanding we need to have. The criticism focuses on how you go about doing that.''</p>
        <p>None of the critics are calling for Eos to be abandoned; they simply want it modified and supplemented so that the goals that even its critics regard as unassailable can be better achieved.</p>
        <p>The critics' chief concern is that with all its glamour, glitter and expense, Eos is channeling attention and resources away from other studies of the Earth-atmosphere system that are just as essential to understanding how it works.</p>
        <p>''I'm afraid we're going to spend 10 times as much money and probably do it one-tenth as well as we could, and we won't get anywhere near the results because a lot of things are being left out,'' said Don L. Anderson, a geophysicist at the California Institute of Technology who is the current president of the American Geophysical Union, the nation's leading professional society for earth scientists. Dr. Anderson was chairman of a 1988 panel of the National Research Council that recommended a broader approach to earth studies.</p>
        <p>Critics also say that the Eos approach of concentrating many instruments on a few large satellites makes the project too vulnerable to a catastrophic failure and requires that compromise orbits be used that are not the best for some of the instruments. Some complain further that the long delays required for costly, large-scale construction will retard the collection of data needed to make environmental decisions as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>At 15 tons, the Eos satellites will be the biggest unmanned satellites ever launched by NASA, and one critic charges that they were made so big largely as a result of bureaucratic politics within the space agency rather than for scientific reasons. Agency officials deny that contention.</p>
        <p>The Goals</p>
        <p>Ambitious Study Of Earth's Essence</p>
        <p>Eos - the initials of its title spell the name of the Greek goddess of the winds and stars - is the heart of Mission to Planet Earth, a broader NASA effort that includes some smaller, long-planned remote-sensing satellites. Mission to Planet Earth, in turn, has become a major feature of a still broader Global Change Research Program being pursued by the Government as part of an international effort.</p>
        <p>Each of the six Eos satellites is to carry 12 sensing instruments in a pole-to-pole orbit, scanning the Earth below. Plans call for the first satellite to be launched in 1998, with others following over the next 12 years. Each is intended to function for five years. An elaborate, pioneering new system to handle the data sent back from orbit is to be in place before the first satellite is launched.</p>
        <p>Instruments aboard the Eos satellites include imaging radar, lasers, spectrometers and infrared beams, harnessed together to monitor vital signs of the Earth like temperature, ocean currents, clouds, the transport of heat and water, winds, emissions of heat-trapping ''greenhouse'' gases, the state of crops and forests, the amount of ice in the sea, the flow patterns of glaciers, the spread of deserts and the evolution of ecosystems.</p>
        <p>Besides the long-planned smaller satellites that have now become ancillary parts of Mission to Planet Earth, the project will also include a number of new ''earth probes,'' small satellites to be launched well before the first Eos platform goes into orbit in 1998. These will be focused on three needs: observation of the planet's protective ozone layer, biological activity in the ocean and rainfall in the tropics.</p>
        <p>The cost of the Eos project, including operational expenses, is calculated at $17 billion in current dollars by the year 2000, and $30 billion in constant 1990 dollars between now and 2020, when the last satellite will have expired and the last data-processing will be complete.</p>
        <p>Of the $17 billion, about a third is to go for the data system, about a third for the satellites and about a third for the support of scientists who will analyze and interpret the data.</p>
        <p>The Fears</p>
        <p>Vital Ground Data May Be Neglected</p>
        <p>The Earth and its atmosphere make up a single, seamless, interdependent system, and advocates of Eos say the project will supply the means, for the first time, to monitor and measure on a global scale many of the complex interactions of air, sea, land and living things that create and manipulate the climate.</p>
        <p>Those interactions ''are going to determine how the Earth behaves in the future as human beings influence the environment,'' said Dr. Lennard D. Fisk, NASA's associate administrator for space science and applications. ''What Eos is designed to do,'' he said, ''is provide a sufficient observational base to understand how those couplings work. It is the first time we're going to try a project that is comprehensive in studying the Earth.''</p>
        <p>But critics say that as things are turning out, an over-reliance on the Eos satellites threatens other vital studies. They say the satellites cannot carry out the full range of observations and measurements necessary to understand how the global atmospheric system works. Measurements from ground stations, aircraft, ships and balloons, as well as laboratory experiments, are also required.</p>
        <p>Among the work in danger of getting short-changed, said Dr. Anderson of Caltech, are studies of the Earth's interior processes, of the subsurface movement of tectonic plates that help determine the planet's carbon cycle, of the Earth's climatic history as disclosed in ice cores, of the impact of solar processes on the Earth, of interactions between the surface and the atmosphere and of humankind's interaction with the environment.</p>
        <p>The original proposal for the Mission to Planet Earth, in 1988 by the special panel of the National Research Council headed by Dr. Anderson, had called for a balanced approach in which instruments on the ground as well as in space would play equally important roles in creating an integrated picture of the earth, the atmosphere, the oceans, biological organisms and the processes that link them.</p>
        <p>Officials of the Bush Administration say they recognize that there must be a balance between both types of studies. But the space agency is already scheduled to consume $661 million of the Government's $1 billion budget for research on global change in the fiscal year 1991, which begins Oct. 1. The remaining third is to be split among six other agencies that deal primarily with ground-based research and observations. Critics fear that the share spent on studies in space will rise in future years as development costs of Eos escalate and possible delays drive up expenses.</p>
        <p>The Origins</p>
        <p>Projects Shaped By Agency Politics</p>
        <p>The big-science shape of Eos may have been determined largely by politics within the space agency, said Dr. Thomas M. Donahue, a professor of planetary science and physics at the University of Michigan who headed the space science board of the National Research Council in the 1980's. The idea of putting a number of instruments aboard one satellite to study the global environment had been proposed by NASA's office of space science and applications, whose budget was far too small to support such a program.</p>
        <p>So the science office struck a deal with the larger, richer space station office, which was promoting construction of a large manned outpost in space, a project that had been severely criticized by many eminent space scientists. The science office agreed to support the space station, Dr. Donahue said, and in return the space station office agreed to carry the cost of the satellite platforms for what would become Eos.</p>
        <p>''The availability of the station platform took over the process of deciding between a big platform and a number of smaller ones,'' Dr. Donahue said. ''It was a major factor in the configuration.'' That, he said, is how the office of space science got ''stuck with the big platform.''</p>
        <p>Agency officials paint a somewhat different picture. It is true that ''we sort of cut a deal,'' said Dr. Burt Edelson, then head of the NASA science office, under whose direction the Eos project began. ''In the face of the agency trying to start up the space station program, I could never have come up with a brand new multibillion dollar program,'' he said. ''It was a good deal for'' the space station office, he added, ''because they were gaining the support of a very large and vociferous element of the national scientific community.''</p>
        <p>But Dr. Edelson said the size of the Eos satellites was not dictated by the deal and that scientific considerations decreed an even larger platform than the space station office wanted to provide. ''It was essentially dictated by the power and weight of the principal instruments,'' he said. ''They are huge, heavy instruments,'' with the largest weighing more than two tons.</p>
        <p>There will soon be no connection between the space station and Eos. With the 1991 budget, Eos will be paid for not by the space station office but by the science office.</p>
        <p>The Options</p>
        <p>Smaller Satellites And More of Them</p>
        <p>Some critics say that concentrating so many instruments on a a single large satellite entails risks that could be lessened or avoided by adopting a more modest approach.</p>
        <p>''I'm convinced that a better way to do the entire mission would be to use a number of smaller satellites,'' said Dr. Donahue. Citing the ''unprecedented complexity'' of the Eos satellites, he argues that some of the instruments should be placed in different orbits to be most effective and that ''failures of various kinds could cause us to lose the entire platform, whereas the loss of one smaller satellite would be less catastrophic.''</p>
        <p>NASA officials say the need for different orbits will in some measure be accommodated by the smaller ''earth probes,'' which are to be launched earlier than Eos and are intended to fill in some observational gaps that Eos would otherwise leave open.</p>
        <p>But critics say there are not enough of the probes, and that some vitally important observations are being sacrificed in the short term. Among them are detailed measurements of changes in infrared radiation in the atmosphere. A satellite had been performing such measurements since 1985, but its instruments expired earlier this year. Scientists consider such measurements essential to understanding global warming.</p>
        <p>''We need to obtain that understanding in this decade,'' said Dr. James Hansen, a climatologist at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies who is a leading investigator of global warming. Eos, he said, may not be operating even in eight years. ''We've had experience with large missions in the past and every one has slipped,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Even if Eos were launched now, said Dr. Hansen, it would be necessary to launch another, smaller satellite in a different orbit to provide sufficient coverage of radiation changes. This is an example, critics say, of how Eos compromises scientific objectives.</p>
        <p>Arguments for Grouping</p>
        <p>Supporters of the Eos concept say its instruments must be grouped aboard a single satellite because they must monitor the Earth simultaneously, from the same spot, to fulfill their mission.</p>
        <p>They also cite a cost factor. ''You have to admit that the platforms are a compromise that is not ideal for each instrument,'' said Dr. Edelson, ''but you couldn't afford to have a separate satellite for all the instruments.''</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, in response to the concerns, NASA planners are re-examining the wisdom of grouping the instruments, although they still plan to do so on the first series of three platforms. With five-year lifetimes each, these will monitor the globe for 15 years.</p>
        <p>In a report in March, a special panel of the National Research Council, reviewing the project at the request of the Bush Administration, endorsed the placing of all instruments on a single satellite in the first series. The panel said there is a scientifically ''convincing'' need for simultaneous observations from several instruments together. Otherwise, the report said, the processes of global change cannot be properly understood.</p>
        <p>But the panel questioned whether such an approach will be desirable for a second series of satellites, to be launched at five-year intervals, alternating with the first series platforms, beginning in 2000.</p>
        <p>A likely alternative now being explored by NASA is to divide the second series of instruments into groups of three, according to their scientific compatibility, and place them on three satellites instead of one.</p>
        <p>Other Measurement Needs</p>
        <p>''We're asking NASA to go back and look at the options,'' said D. James Baker Jr., an oceanographer who heads the review panel. Dr. Baker is the president of Joint Oceanographic Institutions Inc., a consortium that coordinates academic research.</p>
        <p>The interim report of the Baker panel also said that some Earth characteristics ''must be measured by space-borne instruments in other orbits'' besides that of the Eos satellites, and that many others ''must be measured on the surface of the earth or in the ocean.'' Dr. Baker cited as examples deep ocean currents, ocean chemistry and sediments, plus some geologic features and surface areas that are obscured by clouds.</p>
        <p>One of the most serious unresolved issues, the report said, is how the continuity of data, a vital factor in research, would be affected if a big platform or one vital instrument failed. The panel is scheduled to make a final report next month.</p>
        <p>Viewing the Earth As a Single System</p>
        <p>The Earth Observing System will enable scientists to monitor simultaneously, for the first time, many of the complex interactions of air, sea, land and living things in the Earth's environment. The goal is to make more precise and reliable forecasts about global warming and other environmental factors, especially changes brought about by human activity. (source: NASA; NOAA)</p>
