        <p>LEAD: Over a quarter of the lakes and ponds in the Adirondack Mountains are so acidic that the vast majority of them can no longer support fish, a three-year study by New York's state environmental agency has found. An additional one-fifth of the lakes in the region are so acidic they are considered ''endangered,'' according to the study.</p>
        <p>Over a quarter of the lakes and ponds in the Adirondack Mountains are so acidic that the vast majority of them can no longer support fish, a three-year study by New York's state environmental agency has found. An additional one-fifth of the lakes in the region are so acidic they are considered ''endangered,'' according to the study.</p>
        <p>The study, one of the most thorough surveys in the nation of the effects of acid rain on a region, found the proportion of lakes in the Adirondacks that were acidic to be 15 percent higher than surveys by the Federal Government had indicated.</p>
        <p>The Commissioner of the state's Environmental Conservation Department, Thomas C. Jorling, said the study, which is still under review, ''confirms beyond a doubt'' that the ''adverse effects of acid rain on aquatic systems are real.'' 'Needed' Documentation</p>
        <p>The study, he said, ''gives the documentation that the skeptics out there said they needed.''</p>
        <p>State officials acknowledged, however, that the data from the study had not yet been fully analyzed and that some of the lakes that are acidic and that have no fish may be that way naturally, but they said that number was relatively small compared with the number of lakes that have been damaged by acid rain.</p>
        <p>The Reagan Administration has maintained that not enough is known about the effects of acid rain to justify stiffer pollution controls.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jorling said the findings ''demonstrate on their own'' the need for legislation to curb the emissions that cause acid rain.</p>
        <p>Such legislation has been stalled in Congress because of disputes between representatives of Northeastern states, which suffered the most damage from acid rain, and those of Midwestern states, whose coal-fired power plants and other factories are believed to produce much of the pollution that causes acid rain.</p>
        <p>This pollution, mainly oxides of sulfur and nitrogen, is transported through the atmosphere, where it undergoes chemical changes and falls to the ground in the form of acid rain. Agreement by Governors</p>
        <p>Last month, the Governors of New York and Ohio - two states that have been at odds in this debate - announced that they had agreed on a proposal to require sharp reductions nationwide in the emission of these pollutants. Today, Governor Cuomo's Washington liaison, Brad Johnson, said legislation to implement the proposal would be introduced in both houses of Congress soon, although no members of Ohio's Congressional delegation have yet agreed to sponsor it. The legislative prospects are uncertain.</p>
        <p>The study of the Adirondack lakes, which was partly financed by the research arm of New York's utilities, draws on extensive surveys of almost half of the 2,700 lakes in the Adirondack region. Most of the region lies within the 6 million-acre Adirondack Park, the largest wilderness area left in the country east of the Mississippi River.</p>
        <p>The Adirondack region is particularly sensitive to the effects of acid rain because of the thinness of the soil there, the high elevation of many of its lakes and the position of the mountains in the weather system. More than two-thirds of the acidified lakes, the study found, are in the southwestern Adirondacks, which under normal weather patterns are the first mountains that clouds traveling east from the Midwest encounter.</p>
        <p>The most famous and frequently visited of the Adirondack lakes, such as Lake George and Mirror Lake at Lake Placid, are so large that they are not yet threatened by acid rain, state officials said.</p>
        <p>Of the 1,245 Adirondack lakes surveyed, the study found 319 of them, or 26 percent, to be so acidic - with a pH factor of 5 or below - that except under rare circumstances they contain no fish. The pH scale is a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution; the lower the pH, the more acidic the solution. Pure water has a pH of 7, and lemon juice has a pH of 2. The average pH of rainfall in New York is about 4. Considered 'Endangered'</p>
        <p>The study found that an additional 235 lakes, or 19 percent, have a pH of between 5 and 6, and are considered by researchers to be ''endangered.'' Research on acid rain indicates that at a pH of 5.5 many fish populations and plant species die off.</p>
        <p>State environmental officials said lakes with a pH between 5 and 6 would be likely to recover if acid rain-producing emissions were cut substantially in the next few years. Dumping tons of lime, an alkaline substance, into lakes with a lower pH has enabled some lakes to sustain fish, but because a lake may drain seven or eight times a year, this process requires constant monitoring.</p>
        <p>Because reliable past data are scarce, the study does not document any trends. But David Shaw, program development coordinator for the State Environmental Conservation Department's Air Division, said there was some evidence of a trend toward acidification. ''In cases where we've got data, it shows in some lakes there was a fishing opportunity and there no longer is one; the lake has become acidified,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The study concluded that 25 percent of the lakes in the Adirondacks have no fish. But because the data from the study are still being analyzed, state officials said they could not draw a direct correlation between lakes with a low pH and lakes with no fish.</p>
        <p>Kurt Anderson, environmental affairs manager for the Empire State Electric Energy Research Corporation, the utilities' research arm that helped finance the study, said that because the scientific analysis had not been completed, no conclusions could be drawn from the data. ''We know what it says, but what it means is yet to be determined,'' he said. Contrast With Federal Study</p>
        <p>The results of the study contrast with those of a Federal survey released last fall by the National Acid Precipitation Program, an interagency group, which put the proportion of lakes in the Adirondacks that were acidified at 10 percent.</p>
        <p>But Christian Rice, a spokesman for the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, said the results of the two studies were not contradictory because the Federal study excluded small lakes under 10 acres, which are more sensitive to acid rain, while the state study sampled lakes as small as one acre. He also said recently revised E.P.A. estimates put the proportion of acidified lakes in the Adirondacks at 14 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rice said the New York study was unlikely to influence the Administration's position that more data were needed because ''the question is what is the trend, and neither our study nor the New York State study gives us that.''</p>
