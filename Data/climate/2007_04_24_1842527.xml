        <p>8 P.M. (13, 49) SAVED BY THE SUN -- Gas prices are through the roof, oil supplies are dwindling, and global warming is on everyone's radar. Could solar energy be a cleaner solution? In this ''Nova'' special, above, scientists explain advances in technology that may make this once-futuristic energy source viable. Proponents and critics discuss the possibilities.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Fox) AMERICAN IDOL  -- ''Idol'' is giving back to society left and right. Last week the show's audience ejected Sanjaya Malakar. And this week, after the remaining six contestants sing about hope and compassion, the show and its sponsors will match every vote cast with a donation to help children living in poverty in the United States and Africa.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Fox) HOUSE -- A young scam artist passes out on the street. This time, it's the cynicism of Foreman (Omar Epps, right) that drives the medical investigation: he assumes that the woman's underprivileged background means that drugs are to blame. House has other problems: Cuddy and Wilson are going on a date.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (CW) PUSSYCAT DOLLS PRESENT: THE SEARCH FOR THE NEXT DOLL -- The show's run ends, as the final contestants engage in one more marathon cat fight before the next Doll is announced. Then the lucky woman performs with the Pussycat Dolls.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (13, 49) HOT POLITICS -- This ''Frontline'' documentary, made with the Center for Investigative Reporting, looks at the politics and economics of global warming, focusing on the motivations for the United States' decision not to ratify the Kyoto climate treaty.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (A&amp;E) DRIVING FORCE -- The Force family, which typically engages in heart-pounding competitive drag racing, slows down the action when John wants to go camping with his wife and daughters: Ashley, 24; Brittany, 20; and Courtney, 18, all drag racers like their dad. How will this family handle such a peaceful pastime?</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (13, 49) ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM -- The ''Independent Lens'' series presents this Academy Award-nominated documentary, based on the book by Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind, about the destruction of this corporation (above, the former chairman Kenneth Lay, left, and the former chief executive Jeff Skilling).</p>
        <p>10:30 P.M. (Oxygen) TORI &amp; DEAN: INN LOVE -- You can take the daughter of a television mogul out of Hollywood, but you can't take the Hollywood out of her reality TV show. The renovations are done, and the stars are coming out when Tori Spelling and her husband, Dean McDermott, hold the grand opening of their bed-and-breakfast in Southern California.</p>
