        <p>LEAD: When it comes to the environment, public television carries on as though there were no tomorrow. Which, granted, may be the point.</p>
        <p>When it comes to the environment, public television carries on as though there were no tomorrow. Which, granted, may be the point.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, the Public Broadcasting System presented ''Global Dumping Ground,'' a ''Frontline'' report on America's export of toxic wastes. Last month, there was ''A Decade of Destruction,'' a five-hour documentary on the Brazilian rain forest, and this month brings the Ecuadorean rain forest. In August, a National Audubon Society special, ''Ancient Forests: Rage Over Trees,'' flew to the defense of the northern spotted owl and other species in the old forests of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
        <p>That sampling is by no means exhaustive. Nobody on television has ever met an elephant or a whale he didn't like. (Coming from ''Nova'' in November, ''Can the Elephant Be Saved?'', yet another safari into ivory poaching country.) And nobody on any channel, commercial, cable or public, likes polluted air, soil or water, not to mention a depleted ozone layer.</p>
        <p>The environment is television's sacred cow, and the obeissances are most frequent and prolonged on the public stations. To say an unkind word about public television's year-long Operation Earth campaign comes close to irreverence. The cause is so right, the intentions so righteous, and often the programs are very well done. One may suspect, nevertheless, that the proliferation is also fertilized by the public relations needs of the corporations that pay for them, since the subject, particularly where animals are involved, attracts an upscale ''Masterpiece Theater'' audience, whose influence far exceeds its size. Ocean Spray Cranberries, chief funder of ''Race to Save the Planet,'' the 10-hour opus that begins tonight at 9 on public stations and carries on, for two hours a night, through Thursday, may still be trying to wash away memories of the great cranberry scare of some years ago.</p>
        <p>Alas, even virtuous causes can wear down the television viewer. And this viewer has been ground right into the abused earth by ''Race to Save the Planet.''</p>
        <p>The new series is commendable in many ways, only not as compelling television. It travels the endangered globe, pausing here and there to show how we are poisoning ourselves and reporting on efforts to turn things around. It begins tonight with primitive man and describes the change from a hunting-gathering society to a farming society and from there to the industrial revolution and so into the atomic age. One might imagine that a journey from prehistory to tomorrow in 60 minutes must speed by, but as experts succeed each other with unstartling information, you may feel that it is taking centuries.</p>
        <p>The second hour has to do with Los Angeles, pollution heaven, and with the Rhine, which has suffered from the wastes of the chemical plants that line its shores. The improbably dull narrative (''This rotation system has many benefits.'') is dutifully read by Roy Scheider, and there are unnecessary introductions by Meryl Streep posed before the greenery of her Connecticut estate. (Celebrities are drawn to environmental causes like dolphins to tuna.) The bad habits of the American consumer, like driving cars and using aerosol cans, are noted, perhaps in an effort to give the program life, but they don't help much. The material is simply too familiar; it seems recycled. The reliance on pictures of a sort one has seen before and on experts one doesn't care to see again is unredeemed by flair.</p>
        <p>Tomorrow night, it's back to the rain forests of Brazil. And the series proceeds for the rest of the week with efforts by people from India to Indonesia to Iowa to protect nature, improve farming, repair erosion, save energy, reduce and treat waste, recycle paper, glass and metals, control population and so forth.</p>
        <p>I cannot pretend that I sat through every minute of all 10 hours, but I watched enough to respect the serious approach of the producers, particularly their refusal to settle for easy solutions and their appreciation of the interrelations of politics, economics and conservation, yet remained stubbornly unengaged.</p>
        <p>The series has its lively moments, notably a brief segment in program nine about Thailand's love affair with condoms, but watching most of it is too much like being trapped in an endlessly edifying set of implacably unfelicitious lectures: ''These technologies can achieve their optimal removal efficiences for all the pollutants of concern only under very precise operating protocol,'' says one expert. Worthiness descends like smog. The dire phrase ''educational television'' springs to mind. (To get scheduling matters straight, or as straight as possible on PBS, the first hour, ''The Environmental Revolution,'' made its first appearance Thursday evening, and the series will continue on Thursdays for an hour a week until it wears itself out in December. This week's five-night ''stunt,'' to use the PBS word, represents the system's effort to make the sort of impact it did with ''The Civil War,'' which ran for five consecutive nights last month. The difference is that ''The Civil War'' was an extraordinarily absorbing work. With inferior programs, such heavy planting can cause interest erosion. And if 10 hours of the environment in 5 nights isn't enough, on most of those nights, Channel 13, in a merciless bit of scheduling, leads in with ''In Your Own Backyard,'' four half-hours worth of pollution in the New York area. As Mr. Scheider says, a rotation system has many benefits.) Are there lessons to be drawn from this ordeal, other than that talent is as useful as earnestness in making television documentaries? One lesson, perhaps, is that the blockbuster approach, however alluring for the new promotion-minded managers of PBS, can put too great a burden on viewer, producer and subject. In this case, instead of exciting interest, it strains attention. A single hour given, say, to the plans to clean up Los Angeles, might have been less of a challenge for the makers and more rewarding for their audience. The environmentalists themselves teach that smaller is often better.</p>
