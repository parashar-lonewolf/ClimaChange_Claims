        <p>LEAD:  Gabriel's World Music</p>
        <p>Gabriel's World Music</p>
        <p>Months after Martin Scorsese's ''Last Temptation of Christ'' opened in theaters, Peter Gabriel's score for the film has finally been released as an album. A two-disk set, ''Peter Gabriel - Passion'' (Geffen), was recorded in Mr. Gabriel's Real World studios in England using singers and soloists from Africa, India, Pakistan and the Middle East. The album includes considerably more music than was heard on the movie soundtrack.</p>
        <p>''After the film had been completed, I continued on for another three or four months building some of the pieces and developing the textures,'' Mr. Gabriel said the other day in a telephone interview from Big Sur, Calif. ''I wanted 'Passion' to stand as a piece of work in its own right.''</p>
        <p>''Traditionally in religious films, the screen lights up and heavenly voices start to sing whenever Christ appears,'' Mr. Gabriel said. ''Marty Scorsese wanted music that was very different and that would give people a sense of what it might have been like to live during the time of Christ. He felt it wasn't necessary for the score to be historically or geographically accurate beyond having a Middle Eastern flavor. It was quite all right with him if I used Brazilian, Turkish, Pakistani and Iranian music.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gabriel began building the score with the rhythm instruments and later added color and texture. He worked with Hossam Ramzy, an Egyptian percussionist, to find atmospheric rhythms, spent time in the National Sound Archive in London filling his ears with evocative sounds and got in touch with musicians through the World of Music, Arts and Dance Festival, an annual event he founded in the early 1980's.</p>
        <p>''It was exciting to sit in the studio and build up pictures,'' he said. ''For the section called 'Passion,' I used a rhythm I had recorded in Brazil, some Qawwali singing, a little of Youssou N'Dour's vocals, Jon Hassell's trumpet and an English choirboy.''</p>
        <p>In addition to piecing together the score like a collage, Mr. Gabriel played a number of keyboard and percussion instruments and contributed some vocal textures.</p>
        <p>The score is the most adventurous expression so far of Mr. Gabriel's passionate interest in non-Western music, which began in the late 1970's.</p>
        <p>''One day I was sitting on a train listening to some African music on headphones, and I suddenly realized that I didn't have especially unusual tastes and that this was some of the most wonderful music I'd ever heard,'' he recalled. ''I called some of my friends and said I had an idea for an event that would try and combine what is now known as world music with rock music. It took us two years to put together the first World of Music Arts and Dance Festival,'' which was held in 1982.</p>
        <p>The annual event, with which Mr. Gabriel is no longer directly involved, is spread over seven countries and has spawned educational programs and multicultural records.</p>
        <p>More recently the commercial success of Mr. Gabriel's 1986 pop album, ''So,'' enabled him to build his own studio and to set up Real World Records, a new label that is being distributed by Virgin and is devoted to world music artists. Among its first releases are records by the Pakistani singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, who appears in ''Passion,'' the Cuban band Orquesta Reve, and Tabuley, a Zairean singer. The label plans to put out no more than 10 albums a year.</p>
        <p>''Though I never formally studied Western music, it has clearly had an impact on me, especially church music and hymns,'' he said. ''I like bringing the two together. But there still is an enormous amount to learn about world music. When you read musicologists who have spent their whole lives studying just 30 square miles and who are still making interesting discoveries, you get a sense of the breadth of the field.'' Album for Greenpeace</p>
        <p>Next week, Geffen Records will release ''Rainbow Warriors,'' an all-star double album whose 27 cuts (31 in the compact disk form) were all donated by leading pop musicians. The proceeds from the record's sale will go to Greenpeace, the international environmental organization.</p>
        <p>Among the artists who donated cuts to the record, which was released in the Soviet Union last March, are U2 (''Pride''), Sting (''Love Is the Seventh Wave''), the Grateful Dead (''Throwing Stones''), INXS (''This Time''), Terence Trent D'Arby (''Let's Go Forward''), R.E.M. (''It's the End of the World as We Know It''), Lou Reed (''Last Great American Whale''), Talking Heads (''City of Dreams''), Peter Gabriel (''Red Rain''), Sade (''I Will Be Your Friend''), John Cougar Mellencamp (''We Are the People''), Dire Straits (''Why Worry'') and Belinda Carlisle (''Heaven Is a Place On Earth'').</p>
        <p>Greenpeace expects to raise sevreal million dollars for its compaigns on global environmental issues, such as acid rain, ozone destruction and alternative energy research.</p>
        <p>This is the first Western pop album to be widely distributed in the Soviet Union. The Soviet state label, Melodiya, agreed to press four million copies, most of which have been distributed. Rock Aspirations</p>
        <p>The Bottom Line Repertory Company, which originated the rock-oriented musicals ''Leader of the Pack'' and ''Just Once,'' will open a new show, ''A Hot Minute,'' on July 6 for a limited run at the Bottom Line (15 West Fourth Street).</p>
        <p>The show, which was conceived by Melanie Mintz, deals with the lives of backup and studio singers who aspire to be center-stage performers. The score combines well-known pop songs with new material by such contemporary writers as Desmond Child, Franne Golde, David Lasley, John Hall, Jeff Franzel, Marilyn Berglass and Gordon Grody.</p>
