        <p>Unusually warm water over several months last summer followed by a wave of disease has killed a sizable fraction of the corals in parts of the Caribbean, the latest episode in a worldwide decline of coral reefs.</p>
        <p>At a monitoring site to the south of St. John in the United States Virgin Islands, 30 percent of the corals have died. ''Reefs that were growing in Columbus's time are dying in a six-month period,'' said Jeff Miller, a fisheries biologist with the National Park Service. The park service repeatedly visits coral locations to track their health.</p>
        <p>Sizable die-offs have occurred at other monitoring sites around the Virgin Islands, Mr. Miller said, although he hoped they were not quite as severe. ''I fear for substantial losses of coral cover throughout the reefs,'' he said. ''There's certainly more mortality on the reefs than I've seen at any other time.''</p>
        <p>Individual corals are tiny animals that live symbiotically with microscopic algae known as zooxanthellae. Genetically identical corals form a larger colony, and many grow skeletons of calcium carbonate to produce the reefs.</p>
        <p>When waters become much warmer than usual, as occurred last summer, corals, for reasons not well understood, evict the zooxanthellae. Scientists call that event bleaching, because the corals turn white without the algae.</p>
        <p>''The stress that the corals have seen across the Caribbean in 2005 is more extensive and more severe than what we'd seen in the previous 20 years combined,'' said C. Mark Eakin, director of a program at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association that monitors reef conditions though satellites.</p>
        <p>In October, heavy rains cooled the waters, and the corals began to recover and regain color. ''We thought that we had dodged a big bullet,'' Mr. Miller said.</p>
        <p>Then a month later, a disease called white plague set in, attacking the weakened coral around Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. ''It definitely was a one-two punch,'' Mr. Miller said. The bleaching occurred all around the Caribbean, but he said he did not know if corals elsewhere also died in large numbers.</p>
        <p>Bleaching events are expected to increase in the future as the Earth warms. In addition, carbon dioxide from cars and power plants dissolves into the oceans, turning the water more acidic. Acids dissolve the calcium carbonate in corals' skeletons. Corals have survived much larger climate swings in the past, but this time the change is coming more quickly.</p>
        <p>''The evidence is pretty overwhelming that we're having a negative impact on the system,'' said Dennis Hubbard, a marine biologist at Oberlin College. ''We need to figure out how to fix it.''</p>
        <p>While the dead skeletons of corals do not immediately fall apart, they tend to be overrun by seaweed, and because corals grow only a fraction of an inch per year, areas of dead coral will not return to splendor for centuries.</p>
