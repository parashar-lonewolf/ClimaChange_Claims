        <p>Brace yourself for several years' worth of bad puns about hot air. The Clinton Administration took up a Herculean political task by embracing a treaty negotiated in Kyoto, Japan, to cut emissions that lead to global warming.</p>
        <p>The coming fight to win ratification of the accord in Congress may make President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore look environmentally responsible, but it also pits them against important constituencies like business and organized labor. The Administration is presented with political risks comparable to those posed by its health-care plan.</p>
        <p>Under the Kyoto Protocol, the United States is supposed to cut certain emissions 7 percent below 1990 levels over the next 15 years. Other industrialized countries face similar targets, but the developing world has no obligations.</p>
        <p>Republican Senators denounced the treaty, and the White House said it would not seek ratification until developing countries agree to participate. But such nations say they will not make commitments until industrialized countries start cutting back.</p>
