        <p>Dordogne's Caves</p>
        <p>Q. I'd like to visit the prehistoric caves near Les Eyzies-de-Tayac, France. Can you provide me with information on how to get a guide? -- Lawrence W. Hitt, New York, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A. The caves and rock dwellings surrounding the town of Les Eyzies-de-Tayac, in the Dordogne department, in southwestern France, contain some outstanding prehistoric remains, many from the Upper Paleolithic period, which began about 35,000 years ago. During that period, early man made great strides in hunting, tool-making and the drawing and carving of figures, especially animals, which appear on the walls of many of the region's caves.</p>

        <p>Dordogne's Caves</p>
        <p>Q. I'd like to visit the prehistoric caves near Les Eyzies-de-Tayac, France. Can you provide me with information on how to get a guide? -- Lawrence W. Hitt, New York, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A. The caves and rock dwellings surrounding the town of Les Eyzies-de-Tayac, in the Dordogne department, in southwestern France, contain some outstanding prehistoric remains, many from the Upper Paleolithic period, which began about 35,000 years ago. During that period, early man made great strides in hunting, tool-making and the drawing and carving of figures, especially animals, which appear on the walls of many of the region's caves.</p>
        <p>Most of the sites are within 12 miles north and east of Les Eyzies. The caves at Font-de-Gaume, Rouffignac and Bernifal are known for their paintings of bison, horses, and mammoths. There are wall carvings  at Combarelles, Bara-Bahau and St.-Cirq. Cap Blanc, with its 15,000-year-old animal frieze, and Abri du Poisson, which features the carving of a salmon, are also worth a stop, as is  Abri de Cro-Magnon and Le Moustier.</p>
        <p>Admission to the sites varies, but is usually around $5.60. Hours are generally from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., closed on Monday or Tuesday. The Tourist Office of Les Eyzies can provide driving directions and information on hours for each site. Their telephone number is (33 5) 53.06.97.05.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most famous cave in the area -- Lascaux, about 15 miles northeast of Les Eyzies -- is not open to the public, because its carved and painted figures, dating from about 20,000 years ago, are considered too delicate to withstand the carbon dioxide exhaled by visitors.</p>
        <p>But you may visit Lascaux II, a faithful replica, some 200 yards from the original cave. Lascaux II is open every day except Mondays from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; until 7 p.m. in July and August. Admission is $7 (at 7.17 francs to the dollar), $3.50 for children under 16.</p>
        <p>The Tourist Office of Les Eyzies has a list of English-speaking guides. A full day costs about $165, excluding entrance fees. Among the guides are Desdemaine Hugon, (33-5) 53.07.26.04, and Bruno Eluer, (33-5) 53.51.59.12. Both have their own cars.</p>
        <p>A four-hour guided canoe trip  down the Vezere River for a minimum of 15 people is available on Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays. The trips, which cost $27, are led  by a guide from the National Prehistoric Museum. Information: (33-5) 53.05.10.11.</p>
        <p>The museum, housed in a 16th-century chateau on a cliff overlooking the center of Les Eyzies, displays weapons, tools and sculptural blocks, among other artifacts. It is open from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., and until 7 p.m. during the summer. Admission is $3; free for those under 18. Information: (33-5) 53.06.45.45.</p>
        <p>Staying in a Scottish Castle</p>
        <p>Q. I'd like to find some agencies that offer accommodations in Scottish castles. Can you help? -- Wendy Berilman, Milwaukee</p>
        <p>A. Scotts Castle Holidays represents several bed-and-breakfasts, hotels and vacation rentals that are housed in castles. Among them is Culcreuch Castle at Fintry, near Stirling. Built in 1296 and set on 1,600 wooded acres, the hotel has 13 guest rooms and costs from $90 to $114 a person for bed and breakfast. The 16th-century Ballencrieff Castle at Aberlady, near Edinburgh, is a bed and breakfast, with four guest rooms, starting at $102 a person, at 66 pence to the dollar.

        <p>For groups of six or more, Loyd &amp; Townsend-Rose represents 25 castles, most of them charging about $300 a person per night, including breakfast, dinner and drinks. One of its properties, Myres Castle, in Fife, is a 16th-century castle with nine guest rooms. Another, the Tower of Lethendy, in Perthshire, built in 1570 with additions in 1885, has seven bedrooms.

        <p>Among the properties managed by the National Trust of Scotland is Brodick Castle on the Isle of Arran, with two apartments available for rent, primarily on a weekly basis.  Dating back to the 13th century, the castle overlooks Brodick Bay. Prices for an apartment accommodating four people range from $568 a week to $680 during the summer; the cost is from $680 to $833 during the summer for the larger apartment, which sleep six.</p>
        <p>The East Wing Flat at the 16th-century Castle Fraser, 16 miles west of Aberdeen, sleeps five and has a spiral stone staircase leading to a small turret bedroom. The castle is set in extensive grounds with formal gardens and trails. Prices range from $424 to $545 a week, depending on season. Information: (44-131) 243 9331; www.nts.org.uk.</p>
        <p>Tours of Belize</p>
        <p>Q. My wife and I would like to sign up for an educational tour of Belize, if possible with a side trip to Tikal in Guatemala. We also hope to do some hiking and snorkeling. Do you have suggestions? -- Martin L. Tingay, Sarasota, Fla.</p>
        <p>A. Smithsonian Study Tours is offering a nine-day tour called Undiscovered Belize: Walks in the Land of the Maya starting on Jan. 20. The  tour includes treks in the tropical forests of the Maya Mountains; a six-mile hike along the Ixchel Tropical Research Institute's Rainforest Medicine Trail; and snorkeling off South Water Caye, an island on Belize's barrier reef that is home to ospreys, green herons and frigate birds. The tour also visits several Maya sites, including Che Chem Hah, a ceremonial site on the upper Macal River; Chumpiate Cave, where you climb wooden ladders to see a secret storehouse of Maya pottery, which has been left in its original location; and, in the foothills of the Maya Mountains, the Mayflower Archeological Reserve, a classical Maya site, known for its carved stelae.</p>
        <p>The cost is $3,325 a person, double occupancy, excluding air fare. Information: (877) 338-8687.</p>
        <p>The Massachusetts Audubon Society offers Belize, the Barrier Reef and Tikal, an eight-day tour, half of which is spent aboard the Panorama, a 44-passenger yacht. The trip includes a visit to the Maya sites of Caracol -- an ancient grouping of palaces, plazas and pyramids in Belize that are still being recovered from the jungle -- and Tikal, with its carved stelae, ceremonial platforms and temple pyramids, in Guatemala. The cruise departs from Belize City on the third day of the tour, and visits several islands off Belize's Caribbean coast, including Laughing Bird Cay, Half Moon Cay, South Water Cay and Goff's Cay. Snorkeling, birdwatching and a cruise up Monkey River are among the highlights of the tour. Prices range from $2,995 to $3,995 a person, double occupancy, excluding air fare. Information: (800) 289-9504.</p>
