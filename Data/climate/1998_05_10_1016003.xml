        <p>FROM our vantage point in the year 2098, an age of unparalleled peace and prosperity, it is easy to pick out the starting point for civilization's remarkable ascent. Yet looking back at that bittersweet year of 1998, when scientists first disclosed that cocoa farms, the source for the world's supply of chocolate, were under siege from fungal and viral diseases and insects, the future looked dark indeed. Visions of deprivation, rationing and the gradual disappearance of chocolate gave rise to a burst of dystopian fervor in film, literature, music and computer art. Global morale sank under the weight of chocolate substitutes. Even today, the memory of carob kisses and solid licorice Easter bunnies causes an involuntary shudder in all who lived through those bleak times.</p>
        <p>Who could predict that, as the chocolate dreams of our ancestors melted, a new spirit of enlightenment would emerge, leading to a profound re-interpretation of human character and capability. What follows is a brief chronology of major incidents in the Great Chocolate Panic and its unforeseen benefits to the world.</p>
        <p>1999 In early signs of the coming hysteria, sales of Easter bunnies and Mother's Day chocolates rocket, yet few of these gifts are actually given away. Hoarding is commonplace, resulting in a surge in sales of refrigerators by chocolate lovers desperate to store their supply, and a subsequent scarcity of chemical refrigerants. Soon after, scientists in South Africa announce the discovery of O-Zone, the gas that not only made refrigerators and air conditioners work better but also closed the hole in the ozone layer that threatened the 21st-century atmosphere.</p>
        <p>2002 The financier Warren Buffet corners the market on chocolate, which briefly becomes the world's most precious commodity. The developer Donald J. Trump is forced to abandon plans to build his Trump Chocolate Palace on the West Side of Manhattan, an announcement that sends Dow Jones average soaring above 15,000. Mr. Buffet is so enriched that he voluntarily cuts chocolate prices in a humanitarian gesture while endowing a new Yankee Stadium in the site abandoned by Mr. Trump. In a curious development, the Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth W. Starr says his forthcoming report will reveal evidence of illegal gifts of chocolates by former President Bill Clinton to a secretary in the Oval Office.</p>
        <p>2005 A little-known performance artist in downtown Manhattan who drips melted chocolate on her body to satirize society's hypocritical attitudes toward pleasure is mobbed by audiences. The art presages the renaissance in artistic patronage that has characterized the 21st century. Meanwhile, a 15-step program, developed for chocoholics, is found to alleviate all forms of addiction. ''It's simple, really,'' a theorist says. ''Twelve steps weren't enough.''</p>
        <p>2030 As supplies of chocolate near an all-time low, scientists researching chocolate's effect on the pleasure center of the brain make a startling discovery: A little-known drug called Viagra, once thought to cure male impotence, is found to stimulate the same lobe of the brain as chocolate, producing the sensation of eating a box of Godivas. The discovery of The Pill, as it was thereafter known, has wide-reaching effects, not only saving Pfizer from bankruptcy but also making it possible to experience the pleasure of eating desserts without gaining weight. People consume the drug directly and also grind it into tapioca puddings and yellow cakes in an effort to recreate a previous generation's chocolate desserts. Food critics sneer at The Pill as another ''white chocolate,'' that once-popular but tasteless blend of cocoa butter, milk solids and sugar that contained no cocoa solids whatsoever.</p>
        <p>2040 Initial glee over the rediscovery of a remarkable 100-year-old formula for ersatz chocolate is dashed by the revelation that it was developed by Nazi scientists in 1940, setting off an international debate over whether to use the formula or bury it. A movement of 20-year-olds, repelled by the willingness of their elders to sacrifice morality for chocolate, results in a bridging of the generation gap and a rise in historical perspective.</p>
        <p>2050 In a seemingly desperate attempt to head off the extinction of cocoa, Congress, led by the charismatic Representative Barton Hershey (Independent of Pennsylvania), agrees to clear national forests for planting of cacao trees. The effort fails, but Mr. Hershey achieves national prominence, which for the first time in decades inspires talented young people to become politicians.</p>
        <p>2075 Israeli and Palestinian scientists, after working in secrecy for decades, issue a joint announcement: they have made the desert bloom with cacao trees. Plantings in Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa are unimaginable successes, bringing wealth to previously impoverished people and peace to societies that have battled for centuries.</p>
