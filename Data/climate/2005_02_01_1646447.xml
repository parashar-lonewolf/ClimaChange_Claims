        <p>James Cameron, one of the masters of celluloid science fiction, has become fixated with what might be called ''reality science'' to the point where he has melded science and moviemaking into ''Aliens of the Deep,'' a three-dimensional, Imax-scale exploration of geophysics and extreme biology at the bottom of the sea.</p>
        <p>The 48-minute film, which feels like a cross between a breathtaking theme park ride and a ''Nova'' episode, opened last weekend. In a wide-ranging interview at a Manhattan hotel last week, Mr. Cameron, who at 50 has ridden enormous critical and box office success to a place where he can do whatever he desires, made a case that the arts and sciences can mix and must mix if the public is to become re-enchanted with basic research.</p>
        <p>He studied physics at California State University, Fullerton, but after recognizing that he was not a math whiz, he shifted toward English and, eventually, filmmaking.</p>
        <p>''You turn toward the arts and somehow there's this thought that you can't do both, that the human brain just can't hold the arts and the sciences at the same time,'' he said. ''That's just not true.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cameron, who owns two of the four submersibles used to make the new film, canvassed universities and NASA research centers to hand-pick a crew of young biologists and geologists to join him in 40 dives up to two miles down to the raw volcanic seams in the seafloor that nurture ''dark life,'' riotously rich ecosystems based on chemosynthesis instead of photosynthesis.</p>
        <p>His goal, he explained, was to expose millions of people who would never be able to get into a submarine to the extraordinary diversity and resilience of life on (and possibly off) earth, and to make science ''cool'' again.</p>
        <p>''We approach it from the standpoint of the wonder and awe and mystery and these fantastic organisms and so on,'' he said. ''But in general we just need to be doing so much more of this.''</p>
        <p>Q. What's so interesting about the ocean?</p>
        <p>A. The deep ocean has the same surface area as all the continents of the planet put together. We've got five submersibles in the world that can reach those depths. Russia has two, which we used. Japan has one, the French and the U.S. That's like exploring all the continents of the earth with five Jeeps. We need to be more systematic about exploring all of that.</p>
        <p>There are so many biology and geophysics stories that can be told. Think about just the hydrothermal vents. For this film we went to known sites, and at every single site the biology was very different than other sites even though the initial geologic conditions were very similar.</p>
        <p>So much is not understood about the distribution of these animals -- how they survive when the sites are repaved by volcanism, which happens periodically.</p>
        <p>And we don't know anything about what's going on below the Equator.</p>
        <p>The Indian Ocean is a big blank area for data. So here you have a tsunami that kills probably coming up on a quarter of a million people in an area where there's almost no data on the deep sea. If ever there was a clarion call for knowing more about what's going on in these regions -- even setting aside the biology story, just the geophysical story -- it is that event.</p>
        <p>Q. A lot of groups lately have been trying to generate a sense of urgency about the state of the oceans, making the case that we've depleted the sea's great predatory species -- the tunas, cod and the like. But no one seems to be alarmed.</p>
        <p>A. People don't care about energy issues until they can't buy gas. They don't care. Then they start thinking about hybrid autos. That's the way it works.</p>
        <p>As long as we keep giving them farmed fish from mariculture sources they're not going to appreciate first of all the damage that does, and they certainly are not going to care about a bunch of apex predators out in the middle of the ocean until you just can't get them any more. The average person only reacts when they get directly pushed, a direct stimulus.</p>
        <p>At what point are people going to really acknowledge that global climate change is real and is really going to affect them in a negative way? The problem with that is that as these thermal loads build up, at the point at which it starts to affect you it's already way too late.</p>
        <p>By the point at which people knew the Titanic had hit an iceberg it was way too late, unfortunately.</p>
        <p>Q. What kinds of technical challenges did you face in making ''Aliens of the Deep''?</p>
        <p>A. Imax 3-D is the ultimate immersive experience and if you want to take people to another world this is how you do it.</p>
        <p>The problem for deep ocean photography has been, How do you deal with an Imax camera? The film-based Imax system is a huge camera. It won't fit in a submersible, and you can't put a housing on it and put it outside the submersible at those depths. The engineering is insurmountable.</p>
        <p>We developed a system from scratch, all to do this very specific thing, to shoot Imax 3-D in the deep ocean. It was a partnership between myself and a guy named Vince Pace. Sony supplied us with the camera core technology. We built the motion control rig. We designed a special housing. It all took two years to build.</p>
        <p>We certainly have used it for all this documentary stuff and will continue to do that. I love the camera system and want to use it for my next theatrical feature, which is science fiction.</p>
        <p>Q. How do you think Hollywood has generally done in portraying science in movies?</p>
        <p>A. First of all they almost never get their facts right. Secondly they always show scientists as idiosyncratic nerds or actively the villains. One of the things we tried to do with this film was to show what scientists are really like, which is they're people. And sometimes they're really cool people, and they really care about thaw they're doing. They're not driven by a materialistic value system. They're seeking something else, something more important. That message speaks to me.</p>
        <p>I was in a situation where I could've kept making movies for $10 million or $12 million apiece or whatever, but it just wasn't satisfying.</p>
        <p>I'm doing my next film now because I've identified some really interesting challenges, both aesthetically and technically. Doing the film in 3-D, that makes it fun for me. To just do it as a payday wouldn't be interesting.</p>
        <p>Science doesn't pay that well unless you're working in rigidly applied science for a big pharmaceutical company or something. I'm talking about basic science -- these guys who are out here trying to understand how the earth works and how life works. They're doing it because they're following the path of questions. They're just curious.</p>
        <p>Q. Do you think we've kind of lost track of the value of science in the modern world?</p>
        <p>A. I think there seems to be a disconnect on the part of the general public. They enjoy the technologies, which are the children of science. They certainly couldn't live life without their cellphones, which are based on semiconductors, which are based in quantum mechanics.</p>
        <p>They couldn't live life without their TV sets, which are based on electromagnetic field theory and every other thing.</p>
        <p>These things had to be figured out by people at a time when they didn't know what the applications were going to be. Why is that doing that? Faraday and Volta and all those guys. They didn't have stock in I.B.M.</p>
        <p>I think there's actually a backswing against science. I think we're seeing a weird turn back to a faith-based view of the universe as opposed to empiricism. When you've got a country where 50 percent of the people believe in creation over evolution, I think you've got a big problem because we owe our ascendancy as a species to science and technology.</p>
        <p>We're past the point of saying let's not do that technology thing any more. Even if we wanted to, we can't go back to the garden. It's not going to happen. We can't go back to an agrarian culture.</p>
        <p>There's too many of us, and we've trashed the earth and deforested it anyway.</p>
        <p>Right now we rely on the efficiencies made possible by simple things, like not having warehouses, where you have on-demand supply that's Internet based. Take that away and we die. So we're dependent on this stuff now.</p>
        <p>We've got to think our way out of this. If you've got climate change, if you've got pollution, if you've got wars being fought over energy, which are only going to get worse, and wars being fought over resources, which are going to be the story of the 21st century, you're going to need technological solutions and those are going to come from basic research.</p>
        <p>Without that, we're going to hit a wall as a civilization. Certainly the Maya did, not for the same reasons, but with equally devastating results.</p>
        <p>Q. How do we keep from hitting a wall as a civilization?</p>
        <p>A. My response to that is to make a film like this that inspires people about the sciences. Sure, maybe it's ocean science. That happens to be my area of interest, or space science and exploration. But science metaphorically is exploration even if it's done in a lab. If you have that curiosity and you see the natural world as this big detective story and you want to solve the case then you're a scientist.</p>
