        <p>OPTIONS AND TAXES -- In the latest twist in the stock options game, some executives may have changed the exercise date -- the date options can be converted to stock -- to avoid paying hundreds of thousands of dollars in income tax, federal investigators say. [C1.]</p>
        <p>BUSINESS NETWORKING SITE -- Hoover's, the business research provider, and Visible Path, a technology company, are introducing a free service called Hoover's Connect to help people make professional connections. The service has more ways to shield users' identities compared with many social networking sites, said Antony Brydon, Visible Path's chief executive, above. ''These relationships are very high value, and they need to be controlled,'' he said. [C4.]</p>
        <p>NET ADS AND ACCOUNTABILITY -- A group of large companies have said that by the middle of 2007 they will demand that online publishers hire auditors to check their ad and viewer counts. Meanwhile, online companies like Google and Yahoo have begun to meet with industry groups to answer basic questions on how click-based advertising works. [C1.]</p>
        <p>MEDIA MOGULS' LAUGHTER FACTOR -- Who knew media executives were funny? Perhaps it is because, unlike most other executives, they have friends -- meaning employees -- in the comedy business. [C1.]</p>
        <p>THE LONG ROAD TO AN I.P.O. -- Late last month, Shutterfly, the online photo printing service, crossed a finish line of sorts when it became one of just a few e-commerce companies to go public since the Internet bubble burst. While the offering may have enriched some of the early backers of the company, it has been a money-loser so far for most who bought into it. And it has not brightened the decidedly downbeat mood of venture investors, whose fortunes depend on a healthy market for public offerings. [C1.]</p>
        <p>EQUITY FUND TO FOCUS ON CHINA -- Lehman Brothers and I.B.M. have teamed up to create a $180 million private equity fund to take minority stakes in companies in China. [C9.]</p>
        <p>CONFLICT OVER NET ADDRESSES -- As the first-ever Internet Governance Forum begins in Athens, a conflict is emerging over the use of non-Western characters and languages in Internet addresses. [C9.]</p>
        <p>ADS TARGET AIRLINE INDUSTRY -- More environmental groups are taking aim at the airline industry in ads. Eurostar, which runs the high-speed train service, has started running ads in travel trade publications asserting that a train journey produces only one-tenth the carbon dioxide emissions of a comparable airline trip. [C6.]</p>
        <p>A TEST OF NINTENDO -- In the current generation of consoles, Nintendo's GameCube lags behind Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's Playstation 2. Nintendo is still one of the healthiest companies in the games business, but a big test of the company's strategy will come this fall with the release on Nov. 19 of its new video game console, the Wii.
