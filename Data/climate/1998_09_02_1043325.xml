        <p>WHAT do Sauternes, Tokay, trockenbeerenauslese, vendange tardive, Dolce and Eisrebe have in common? They are some of the world's finest wines, and they are all sweet. Beyond that, few wine drinkers know much about them (except for Sauternes): where they come from, how they are made or even what they taste like.</p>
        <p>Part of the problem is our health-conscious era. To many people, the word ''sweet'' denotes sinfulness or at least unwise excess. But most sweet wines are drunk in moderation. The best of them are too intense, too rich, to be enjoyed other than in small quantities, at the end of a meal.</p>

        <p>WHAT do Sauternes, Tokay, trockenbeerenauslese, vendange tardive, Dolce and Eisrebe have in common? They are some of the world's finest wines, and they are all sweet. Beyond that, few wine drinkers know much about them (except for Sauternes): where they come from, how they are made or even what they taste like.</p>
        <p>Part of the problem is our health-conscious era. To many people, the word ''sweet'' denotes sinfulness or at least unwise excess. But most sweet wines are drunk in moderation. The best of them are too intense, too rich, to be enjoyed other than in small quantities, at the end of a meal.</p>
        <p>The simplest way to make a wine sweet is to add sugar. Champagne is treated this way. At the bottling, a small amount of sugar dissolved in wine is added to impart a degree of sweetness: brut Champagne is almost sugar-free, extra-dry is a bit sweeter, dry is sweeter yet, and doux, much favored in Eastern Europe, is the sweetest of all.</p>
        <p>Most wine grapes are full of sugar when they are picked. But the wines made from them are usually dry because, in fermentation, the sugar is converted into alcohol and carbon dioxide. Naturally sweet wines are made by stopping fermentation before all the sugar has been converted. What's left is called residual sugar. In this country, some inexpensive dry table wines are permitted to retain a small amount of residual sugar because of the wine industry's belief that Americans, raised on soft drinks and fruit juice, ''talk dry but drink sweet.''</p>
        <p>Some sweet wines are called fortified wines because alcohol is added to stop fermentation and to retain a certain amount of residual sugar in the finished wine. In port, the added spirits can amount to a third of the wine's volume and bring its alcohol level up to as much as 21 percent. In other fortified wines -- Madeira, Marsala and sherry, for example -- less alcohol is added.</p>
        <p>The most famous sweet wines -- Sauternes from Bordeaux, Hungarian Tokay and wines like them from Germany, Alsace and California -- need no added sugar. The grapes for them are picked late, when they are overripe and, ideally, shriveled by botrytis cinerea, a beneficial mold, which concentrates their sweetness. When their supersweet juice is fermented, not all of it turns into alcohol, and the result is an intense, naturally sweet wine.</p>
        <p>The botrytis, which does not appear in the vineyards every year, adds a much-prized honey flavor to the wine. The taste of the best of these wines is almost indescribable. They offer layers of flavors of exotic fruits and rare spices with delicious aromas that can fill a room like bouquets of flowers.</p>
        <p>The rarest of these naturally sweet wines are the trockenbeerenausleses from the Rheingau and Mosel regions of Germany. Because of the severe weather in these northern vineyards, ideal growing conditions occur infrequently, sometimes only once in 10 years. ''Trocken,'' meaning dry, refers to grapes left on the vine until completely shriveled. ''Beeren'' means individual grapes, and ''auslese'' means special selection. For obvious reasons, English-speaking folks usually call these wines T.B.A.'s.</p>
        <p>In Sauternes, the principal grape is semillon, often blended with some sauvignon blanc. In Germany, the grape of choice is the riesling, although in recent years, fine T.B.A.'s have been made from the scheurebe grape, a cross between sylvaner and riesling. In Alsace, on the west bank of the Rhine, where late-harvest wines are known as vendange tardive, the most important grape is the gewurztraminer.</p>
        <p>California, as might be expected, offers a variety of sweet wines, made from a variety of sweet grapes, many of them bland. The best include a Sauternes-style wine from Far Niente Vineyards called Dolce, a blend of semillon and sauvignon blanc; a riesling and a wine called Eisrebe, from Joseph Phelps Vineyards, and the occasional late-harvest rieslings and gewurztraminers from Navarro Vineyards.</p>
        <p>Far Niente and Joseph Phelps are in the Napa Valley, Navarro in Mendocino County.</p>
        <p>The name Eisrebe is a combination of ''eiswein'' and ''scheurebe.'' Eiswein, or ice wine, is a late-harvest wine made from frozen grapes. Historically, it was made from grapes deliberately left in the German vineyards into winter, when the temperature would drop low enough to freeze the water in the grapes but would leave sugar, acid and flavor extracts unfrozen. When these grapes are pressed quickly, only the concentrated juice makes its way into the fermentation tanks. The result is a late-harvest sweet wine different in style from other German sweet wines.</p>
        <p>In recent years, wineries in France and California, including the famous Chateau d'Yquem and Joseph Phelps, have been experimenting with freezing late-harvest grapes in wine cellars before pressing them, a process called cryoextraction. The 1996 Eisrebe was made that way.</p>
        <p>Cryoextraction may be new, but sweet wines are not. Many of the wines of ancient Rome are known to have been sweet, and in the 17th century, when the great vineyards of Bordeaux were still swamps or cow pastures, the most famous wine in the world was a sweet wine, Constantia, from the Cape of Good Hope.</p>
        <p>The earliest winemakers, including the Greeks, concentrated the juice in their grapes by spreading the grapes out in the sun on racks or straw mats until they became like raisins. In Italy, many wines are still made this way, including Amarone di Valpolicella in the Veneto, Vin Santo in Tuscany and, in the tradition of sweet wines going back thousands of years, Recioto di Soave.</p>
        <p>The best of these naturally sweet wines are rare and expensive -- a half bottle of Dolce sells for about $50, but a half bottle of a rare T.B.A. can be $500 -- and are certainly not for everyday drinking. Still, they offer an occasional luxurious experience no wine enthusiast should miss.</p>
        <p>Tastings: A Tuscan Gem</p>
        <p>Ruffino Fonte al Sole 1997, Sangiovese di Toscana, Italy. About $10.</p>
        <p>THE wine critic Robert M. Parker Jr. observed recently in his newsletter that the selection of wines in the $10 category was vast but mostly uninteresting. At first, I was skeptical, having come across some good wines in that price range. Trying more of them recently, I've come to agree with his assessment -- except where Italy is concerned.</p>
        <p>There are good $10 red wines from every part of Italy, including Sicily and Sardinia. This Fonte al Sole sangiovese from Ruffino is a perfect example of what Italy can offer in a good, moderate-price wine. Like Chiantis at twice its price, it is made from the sangiovese grape. Also like Chiantis at twice its price, it comes from Tuscany, and in fact, it could pass for some of them.</p>
        <p>This is one of the first wines on the shelves from the great 1997 vintage. Why drink some dull California merlot, when wines like this little gem are to be had?</p>
