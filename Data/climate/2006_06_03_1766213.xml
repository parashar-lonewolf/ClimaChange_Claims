        <p>Editorial contends that Bush administration signed off on weak rule governing mercury emissions from power plants, only days after Gov George Pataki proposed strong rule; holds that states have done better job of cleaning air and protecting public health than federal government has, in part because they have been more aggressive in using regulatory leverage to force industry to develop cleaner ways of doing business; maintains that Pataki, if successful on this score, will end his term with solid record of achievement on clean air issues that should shame his Republican friends in Washington</p>

        <p>The Bush administration signed off on a weak rule governing mercury emissions from power plants this week, only days after Gov. George Pataki of New York proposed a strong rule. This should come as no surprise. Over the last few years, the states have done a better job of cleaning the air and protecting public health than the federal government has, in part because they have been more aggressive in using regulatory leverage to force industry to develop cleaner ways of doing business.</p>
        <p>The mercury issue is a case in point. Mercury is a toxin that has been found in increasingly high concentrations in fish in lakes and streams. The country's 1,100 coal-fired power plants produce 48 tons of it a year, a little over 40 percent of the total produced in the United States. The Bush rule, drafted in part by the electric utilities it seeks to regulate, aims at a 30 percent reduction in emissions by 2010 and a 70 percent reduction by 2018.</p>

        <p>The Bush administration signed off on a weak rule governing mercury emissions from power plants this week, only days after Gov. George Pataki of New York proposed a strong rule. This should come as no surprise. Over the last few years, the states have done a better job of cleaning the air and protecting public health than the federal government has, in part because they have been more aggressive in using regulatory leverage to force industry to develop cleaner ways of doing business.</p>
        <p>The mercury issue is a case in point. Mercury is a toxin that has been found in increasingly high concentrations in fish in lakes and streams. The country's 1,100 coal-fired power plants produce 48 tons of it a year, a little over 40 percent of the total produced in the United States. The Bush rule, drafted in part by the electric utilities it seeks to regulate, aims at a 30 percent reduction in emissions by 2010 and a 70 percent reduction by 2018.</p>
        <p>The rule relies on a market-based trading system that would let utilities reduce emissions or buy credits from other companies, allowing them to defer investments in their own plants. Emissions trading has worked well with other airborne pollutants, but in this case it is inappropriate because mercury, which tends to settle quickly, presents a special danger to residents near the source. The Clean Air Act plainly requires state-of-the-art controls at each plant for toxic substances like mercury, which means that the Bush rule may also be illegal. It is already the subject of a lawsuit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki's plan, by contrast, would require in-state plants to install the latest pollution-control technology with a goal of cutting mercury emissions by 50 percent by 2010 and by 90 percent by 2015. The big power companies managed to convince the Bush administration that targets like these would be ruinously expensive, but Mr. Pataki estimates that at worst they will add less than a dollar a month to the average residential electricity bill.</p>
        <p>If successful on this score, Mr. Pataki will end his term with a solid record of achievement on clean air issues that should shame his Republican friends in Washington. He has imposed new limits on emissions of nitrogen oxide, which helps create smog, and sulfur dioxide, a contributor to acid rain. He has joined six other Northeastern states in a regional effort to reduce greenhouse gases, and he has joined California's effort to force a big reduction in those same gases from automobiles.</p>
        <p>What distinguishes Mr. Pataki and other like-minded governors from the Bush administration -- nearly a dozen other states have imposed or are considering tougher mercury controls -- is their willingness to challenge industry to challenge itself. Mr. Bush has been talking a good game recently about how technology is going to help us on global warming and on producing alternative fuels, but history shows that industry usually needs powerful incentives to make things happen.</p>
