        <p>THE GREAT TRANSFORMATION</p>
        <p>The Beginning of Our Religious Traditions.</p>
        <p>By Karen Armstrong.</p>
        <p>469 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $30.</p>
        <p>There are many versions of the Fall for those who aren't persuaded by the Genesis account. According to one story, the rot set in when benign matriarchy gave way to brutish patriarchy. Another influential scenario, given currency by Brian Swimme and Thomas Berry in their eco-</p>
        <p>theological manifesto ''The Universe Story'' (1992), takes us back to the edenic days of the Neolithic village, a time of ''immense creativity'' and unsurpassed peace that came to an end when we began messing with nature rather than respecting it, thus giving rise to everything from poverty and war to global warming and suburban sprawl.</p>
        <p>Whatever form they take, such stories invariably recall a time of exceptional human flourishing, explain how the glory fled and suggest that we might recover at least some of it today. (Milton's ''Paradise Lost,'' after all, was followed by ''Paradise Regained.'') But in her own version of the Fall, ''The Great Transformation,'' Karen Armstrong doesn't hark back to a primal state of beatitude. Instead, she plunges into the thicket of history, and the confusion and injustice and conflict that attend humankind as far back as we can reliably trace. In fact, it was in such a period of turmoil -- the period between 900 and 200 B.C., which she calls the Axial Age (a term borrowed from the German philosopher Karl Jaspers) -- that ''humanity'' as we conceive of it ''came into being,'' thanks to the insights elaborated in several extremely diverse yet complementary traditions: biblical monotheism, Greek rationalism, Hinduism and Buddhism, and Confucianism and Taoism. ''All the traditions that were developed during the Axial Age,'' Armstrong writes, ''pushed forward the frontiers of human consciousness and discovered a transcendent dimension in the core of their being'' -- until dark forces pushed it aside.</p>
        <p>It would be a remarkable enough feat to track developments in all of these traditions over a span of seven centuries, with glimpses back to the preceding eras and ahead to what followed (including the origins of rabbinic Judaism, Christianity and Islam). What Armstrong -- a former nun who made her name with ''A History of God'' (1993) and has written popular books on Islam, Jerusalem and the Buddha -- attempts, however, is more difficult still. She proposes a narrative in which more or less contemporaneous but seemingly unrelated currents of thought -- the writings of the prophet Ezekiel, for instance, and the teachings of the atheistic school of Hindu philosophy known as Samkhya -- can be seen as parallel episodes in an unfolding drama.</p>
        <p>What exactly Armstrong sees as unfolding is never stated very clearly, but ''The Great Transformation'' can be read as a story of collective human enlightenment much like the familiar idealized accounts of the Renaissance or the Enlightenment proper, though on a much grander scale. She asks us to imagine humanity's self-awareness deepening in successive phases, each assigned to a chronological period. The chapter headings include ''Ritual'' (circa 900 to 800 B.C.), ''Kenosis'' (circa 800 to 700 B.C.)'' and, down the road a piece, ''Empathy'' (circa 530 to 450 B.C.), until the last phase, ''Empire'' (circa 300 to 220 B.C.), brings the Axial Age to a close.</p>
        <p>Of these phases, ''Suffering'' -- the name Armstrong gives to the period between roughly 600 and 530 B.C. -- gets pride of place. It was these years that saw the composition of the Book of Job; the visions of Ezekiel, explaining to his fellow Jews in Babylonian exile why Yahweh's judgment fell upon them; the tenure of Solon, the Athenian lawgiver, who was responding to a threat of civil war; and, in India, the emergence of Samkhya, which was premised on the recognition that somehow life is fundamentally ''unsatisfactory.'' All of these, Armstrong argues, should be seen as responses to extreme social dislocation. Of Ezekiel and his visions, she writes that ''the trauma of exile had smashed the neat rationalistic God of the Deuteronomists,'' the priestly class treated in the preceding stage. ''It was no longer possible to see Yahweh as a friend who shared a meal with Abraham, or as a king presiding powerfully over his divine council.''</p>
        <p>To consider even this one small part of Armstrong's book in any detail -- and to take it in the spirit intended, with the zestful give and take of rabbinical midrash -- would require a small book of its own. It would also reveal many contradictions and incoherencies. Consider, for example, Armstrong's obtuse reading of Job, and its consequences for her larger argument. Like many modern readers, she is irritated by the God of Job, whose magnificent speech from the whirlwind she dismisses as ''a boastful tirade.'' This is her privilege, but she projects her own modern sensibility onto the text, assuming that it reveals a crisis of faith in the exiled Jewish community rather than an affirmation of God's unfathomable sovereignty. And consider, too, what she says about the Deuteronomists. If, as she writes in an earlier section, their ''rational theology'' prompted them to dismiss accounts of God's firsthand encounters with his chosen people, why are they now remembered as having seen ''Yahweh as a friend who shared a meal with Abraham''? And so on. An interpretation of history that depends on correlating events and ideas in such an elaborate chronological sequence doesn't have much flexibility.</p>
        <p>But that reference to Ezekiel and the impact of trauma gives an important clue to Armstrong's larger point. ''Suffering shatters neat, rationalistic theology,'' she writes toward the end of the book. ''Ezekiel's terrifying, confusing vision was very different from the more streamlined ideology of the Deuteronomists. Auschwitz, Bosnia and the destruction of the World Trade Center revealed the darkness of the human heart. Today we are living in a tragic world where, as the Greeks knew, there can be no simple answers; the genre of tragedy demands that we learn to see things from other people's point of view'' and search out ''the spirit of compassion that lies at the core of all our traditions.''</p>
        <p>What we are left with, then, is a story of the Fall in which the serpent in the garden is none other than that old devil, Organized Religion. The ''Axial sages,'' Armstrong contends, would have brushed aside the crude question of whether they believed in God: ''The prophets, mystics, philosophers and poets of the Axial Age were so advanced and their vision was so radical, that later generations tended to dilute it. In the process, they often produced exactly the kind of religiosity that the Axial reformers wanted to get rid of. That, I believe, is what has happened in the modern world.''</p>
        <p>In our own time of ''great fear and pain,''Armstrong proposes that we look to the Axial sages for ''two important pieces of advice,'' both of which turn out to be quite uncontroversial: We should practice self-criticism (amen), and we should ''take practical, effective action'' against excessively aggressive tendencies in our own traditions (amen again). But after 400 pages of historical argument, the banality of such declarations is staggering. Yes, we need to learn to see things from other points of view. But once we have done that, once indifference and ignorance and prejudice and other obstacles are cleared away, real differences -- political, religious, cultural -- remain. As for ''simple answers,'' it all depends on what you mean by simple. Does Job offer simple answers? Does Benedict XVI? The Dalai Lama? Osama bin Laden? Richard Dawkins?</p>
        <p>In fact, none of these ways of seeing the world are ''simple'' -- meaning simplistic. But neither can they all be equally in accord with reality. Like the Axial sages themselves, they contradict one another. And that at least is one truth we can all agree on.</p>
