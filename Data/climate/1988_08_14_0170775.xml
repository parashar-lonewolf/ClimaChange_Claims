        <p>LEAD: The evolving nature of Presidential politics and the medium of television together have all but reduced party conventions to the level of the electoral college, which is to American politics what the vermiform appendix is to the human body. The trend has progressed to the point that the only question now is whether the national conventions will vanish entirely or be recognized for what they have largely become: unpaid advertising on as much prime-time television as can be grabbed off in the name of public service.</p>
        <p>The evolving nature of Presidential politics and the medium of television together have all but reduced party conventions to the level of the electoral college, which is to American politics what the vermiform appendix is to the human body. The trend has progressed to the point that the only question now is whether the national conventions will vanish entirely or be recognized for what they have largely become: unpaid advertising on as much prime-time television as can be grabbed off in the name of public service. But the long free ride is doomed.</p>
        <p>Compared even with 1984, when the conventions provided only molehills of excitement, ratings for this year's Democratic affair in Atlanta were ominously lower. Inevitably, there was talk of giving this week's Republican gathering in New Orleans even less coverage than the few hours a day accorded by the networks to the Democrats, since Republicans rarely go in for blood-letting on the floor of their conventions. Add the fact that they have no Jesse Jackson to spice their agenda and it is clear why the networks might feel that they have had foisted on them this summer a mini-series of minimal substance.</p>
        <p>Fundamental changes in the political machinery are the major villain responsible for this state of affairs. We have advanced in stages from letting Congressional caucuses pick a party's nominee during the nation's early years to a hopeless jumble of local caucuses, state conventions and primary elections, all presumed to express the popular will and make it binding.</p>
        <p>So far has this progression gone to rob the convention of its power and suspense that since Franklin Roosevelt's fourth-ballet nomination in 1932 only one Democrat has required more than a single roll call; the selection of Adlai Stevenson took three ballots in 1952, still a far cry from the 103 required to put John W. Davis across in 1924. As for the Republicans, they have become so skillful at working things out ahead of time that they haven't needed a second roll call since the unpredictable Wendell Willkie's sixth-ballot triumph in 1940.</p>
        <p>For better or worse, the primaries, swollen in number, appeared to have left this year's Democrats with little more to offer television than the question of whether Michael Dukakis could win without any opponent at all. It is hard to dramatize a question like that.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the only thing to be held against the swarms of TV correspondents in Atlanta's Omni Coliseum is that they tried so ineptly to fill time and drum up excitement. As it turned out, they need not have strained quite so hard, since two dramatic developments were to come to their aid. One, of course, was the emotional and warmly received speech delivered by Governor Dukakis to an audience primed to expect all the glow of a bookkeeper attacking a balance sheet. The other was the opening barrage of the first 1992 campaign for the Presidency. Jesse Jackson had positioned himself so that he could swear fealty to the party's standard bearer and at the same time get a rousing four-year jump on the rest of the field, Mr. Dukakis possibly included. Without the least sign of disloyalty to this year's chosen leader, he could and did invoke all the traditional convention hoopla that used to go with a nomination. The strategy could well be a model for enhancing otherwise empty conventions of the future.</p>
        <p>Seeing in these events, significant as they were, little of the immediate conflict that is food and drink to their craftsmen, the networks labored hourly in the pursuit of drama. They beat each other to ''first interviews'' with party bigwigs and made sure that viewers knew of their scoops, such as they were. One TV reporter tried to get a delegate to say, into a microphone, whether or not he would want Mr. Jackson to campaign in his district, with overtones that he would not. Another asked the keynote speaker to rate her performance on a scale of 1 to 10. At one point, NBC's Tom Brokaw put it to a prominent delegate that he hadn't really been listening to Senator Bill Clinton's protracted eulogy of Governor Dukakis, had he?</p>
        <p>Frequently, these pointless encounters kept viewers from hearing luminaries like Ed Muskie and Barbara Jordan. And much of the alloted time went in babble from the booths rather like that of baseball announcers who insist on giving you the batting average not of the man at the plate with a 3-2 count on him but of his grandfather when he played for the St. Louis Browns in 1920.</p>
        <p>With no visible disturbers of the peace, the effect of all this enterprise was to harden a demonstrated public belief that for home entertainment videocassettes are a better bet. More to the point, the excess of imposed harmony reportedly confirmed opinion within the television business that it could make a more judicious investment of its time and money by restricting future coverage of conventions to the productions' hit numbers.</p>
        <p>The result is a vicious circle: The more predetermined the convention's activities, which is to say, the more sweetness and light is brought in to fill a void, the less point there is in extensive coverage on television; without such coverage, why bother at all with an empty circus? Given the figures of primaries and caucuses, however misleading they may be, the party's national committees could ratify the choices in a day, with time for acceptance speeches and balloons in the evening.</p>
        <p>The country might lose something in color, but no one would endure the suffering to which delegates have sometimes been subjected in the past. I think of the day in 1936 when, with Roosevelt's nomination a sure thing, convention managers invited representatives from every delegation - 57 orators in all - to make seconding speeches just to pass the hours. The verbal deluge brought the greenhouse effect to Philadelphia 50 years ahead of the rest of the country.</p>
