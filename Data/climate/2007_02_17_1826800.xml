        <p>For Bounty Hunter, New Extradition Woes</p>
        <p>Duane (Dog) Chapman, below, the star of the reality series ''Dog the Bounty Hunter'' on A&amp;E, again faces extradition to Mexico on charges that he violated Mexican laws when he and several associates captured Andrew Luster, the Max Factor heir and a convicted rapist, in Puerto Vallarta in 2003. The news came a day after Mr. Chapman signed a nine-year deal with A&amp;E to continue with his show, his wife, Beth Chapman, said by telephone. ''We have learned to take the bad with the good, but I can't imagine that they are going to return the Dog to Mexico,'' she said. ''The people there know that what he did was right.'' A federal court in Guadalajara ruled that Mr. Chapman, 53, should face charges of deprivation of liberty, rejecting his lawyers' contention that he could not be guaranteed a fair trial. He faces up to four years in jail if convicted. Following their capture of Mr. Luster, Mr. Chapman and his associates were themselves arrested in Mexico, but left the country on the advice of their lawyers. Then, last Sept. 14, Mr. Chapman, along with a son and another man, was arrested in Hawaii and charged with failing to appear in Mexico regarding the charges. Mr. Luster is serving a 124-year prison term.</p>
        <p>'Live Earth' Concerts Set</p>
        <p>Al Gore said on Thursday in Los Angeles that concerts would be held on seven continents on July 7 to focus attention on the threat of climate change, The Associated Press reported. The concerts, called ''Live Earth,'' will take place in Shanghai; Johannesburg; Sydney, Australia; London; and cities to be named in Japan, Brazil and the United States. Another concert will be held in Antarctica, Mr. Gore said. The concerts, which promoters hope will reach two billion people, will include more than 100 acts, including the Foo Fighters, John Mayer, Korn, the Black Eyed Peas, Faith Hill and Tim McGraw.</p>
        <p>Payments Ordered In Dutch Art Case</p>
        <p>A court has ordered the heir to Jacques Goudstikker, a Jewish art dealer in Amsterdam who fled the advancing Nazis in 1940, to pay one of her lawyers a $10.4 million bank guarantee for helping her recover 202 artworks that had belonged to Mr. Goudstikker but ended up in Dutch museum collections after World War II, Bloomberg News reported yesterday. The heir, Mr. Goudstikker's daughter-in-law, Marei von Saher of Greenwich, Conn., has until March 2 to make the payment to the lawyer, Roelof van Holthe tot Echten, according to the court ruling in The Hague. The lawyer filed a claim seeking to seize the artworks to obtain the money he argued was owed to him by Mrs. von Saher. The Dutch government agreed in February 2006 to hand over the works to Ms. von Saher -- including paintings by Filippo Lippi, Raphael, Rubens and Van Dyck -- after a long legal battle; they have not yet left the Netherlands.</p>
        <p>Unmaking a Band</p>
        <p>Chris Cornell, below, is leaving the band Audioslave, citing ''irresolvable personality conflicts, as well as musical differences,'' The Associated Press reported. Mr. Cornell, 42, formerly with Soundgarden, said he would release a solo album on May 1 called ''Carry On.'' Audioslave was formed in 2001 by Mr. Cornell and three ex-members of Rage Against the Machine.</p>
        <p>A Wagner's Bayreuth Debut</p>
        <p>The Bayreuth Festival said that its 2007 season, its 96th, would open on July 25 with a new production of ''Die Meistersinger,'' directed by Katharina Wagner, 28, the daughter of the festival director, Wolfgang Wagner, and the composer's great-granddaughter, The Associated Press reported. It will be Ms. Wagner's Bayreuth debut, and that of many in her cast of mostly young singers.</p>
