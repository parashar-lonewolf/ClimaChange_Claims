      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>At talks on the Montreal Protocol, which restricts chemicals harmful to the ozone layer, the United States and several other countries gained permission to continue using substantial amounts of methyl bromide through 2006 despite a ban that is to take effect in wealthy countries on Jan. 1. The chemical destroys ozone but is a popular weed and pest killer. American officials said the exemptions were only for farmers or other businesses with no affordable substitutes. Environmental groups argued that the move was mainly aimed at pleasing voters in farm states and would delay the development of safer substitutes.</p>
