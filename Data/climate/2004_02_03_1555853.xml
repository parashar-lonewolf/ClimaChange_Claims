        <p>A. While much remains to be learned about conditions on Mars, the fact that its soil or dirt can be shoveled around is highly encouraging. In all probability, the living quarters for space pioneers will simply be buried under more than a yard of the stuff lying on the surface.</p>

        <p>Radiation on Mars</p>
        <p>Q. If and when people try to live on Mars, or even on the Moon, how will they be protected from radiation?</p>
        <p>A. While much remains to be learned about conditions on Mars, the fact that its soil or dirt can be shoveled around is highly encouraging. In all probability, the living quarters for space pioneers will simply be buried under more than a yard of the stuff lying on the surface.</p>
        <p>Both solar and cosmic radiation are worries in space, the NASA Web site explains. Outside the Earth's protective ozone layer, ultraviolet radiation will rapidly give unshielded space travelers sunburn and skin cancer. The metal skin and most of the glass of spacecraft, however, block much UV radiation.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, when the Sun flares, it produces X-rays, gamma rays and high-energy particles. The particles are the most dangerous, but they are delayed enough that travelers will have some warning, giving them time to get to a a shielded area, perhaps amid water tanks, for a few days until the particles die down.</p>
        <p>Even more such radiation comes continuously from deep space. Small amounts of metal shielding can block most of this, but the rest increases the risk of cancer somewhat, shortening the theoretical life expectancy by roughly a day for every week spent in space's cosmic ray environment. But such a risk is relatively small in comparison with other risks of space exploration.</p>
