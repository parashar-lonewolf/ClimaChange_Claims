        <p>The 225th annual session of the New York State Legislature dragged quietly to a tentative close on July 2, after six months of partisan posturing and wrangling and very little real action.</p>
        <p>Time and again, Gov. George E. Pataki, the Republicans who control the Senate and the Democratic leaders of the Assembly appeared to make progress toward major deals, only to see them fall apart in waves of recrimination. It was, by all accounts, one of the most gridlocked years in memory, a sharp departure from the axiom that Albany finds a way to do business in even-numbered years, when officials must stand for re-election.</p>
        <p>Even the end of the session was not agreed on, having become, like so many things about state government, something of a fiction. The session was scheduled to end on June 20, but trickled on, as each house found reasons to return a few times -- the last a session of the Senate on July 2 to pass a handful of bills -- and each has signaled that it might come back this year, if deals can be reached on major legislation.</p>
        <p>The biggest agreements of the year included giving Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg far greater control of New York City's schools, a big increase in health care spending despite a looming fiscal crisis, and, after two years of bitter conflict, a package of women's health care measures, including requiring insurers to cover contraceptives.</p>
        <p>Chief among the long list of failures was the inability of lawmakers to agree on revamping the state's system of long mandatory sentences for drug crimes, enacted three decades ago under Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller.</p>
        <p>High hopes were also dashed for legislation to reduce rising auto-insurance premiums and insurance fraud, a package of antiterrorism bills championed by the governor, a bill to raise the minimum wage, an overhaul of the state's toxic-waste-cleanup program, a statewide ban on smoking in restaurants and a law to prevent discrimination against gays. A requirement that clergy members report abuse of children to the authorities, agreed on in principle by all sides, appeared to run aground on what seemed like a simple language problem.</p>
        <p>The session began with a deal between Mr. Pataki, a Republican who is running for a third term, and Dennis Rivera, a high-ranking Democrat and the leader of the largest health workers' union in the state, for $1.8 billion in new health care spending over the next three years. About half of that money will go toward pay raises for members of Mr. Rivera's union, 1199/S.E.I.U.</p>
        <p>Despite questions about the fiscal soundness of the deal, it sailed through the Legislature in January, and the union repaid Mr. Pataki by endorsing him for re-election.</p>
        <p>There were 745 bills that passed in both the Assembly and the Senate, most of them addressing narrow local issues like property transfers. Of those, Mr. Pataki has signed 198 into law and vetoed 2, but most have not yet been delivered to his desk.</p>
        <p>Budget  LEGISLATION ENACTED</p>
        <p>Lawmakers passed an $89.6 billion election-year budget on May 17, relatively early, given the recent history of late budgets and legislative gridlock in Albany.</p>
        <p>While other states around the country were cutting spending, New York managed to avoid deep cuts to services and even provided a $420 million increase in education aid, about 3 percent.</p>
        <p>The budget includes $3 billion in one-time revenues, however. It also relies heavily on uncertain new federal aid, spends nearly all of the state's reserves, and adds $900 million in debt.</p>
        <p>All told, the budget raises spending by about 6 percent, though the portion paid entirely with state taxes and fees will go up only 3 percent.</p>
        <p>The Legislature imposed some new taxes and raised a number of obscure fees on items like hunting licenses to bring in about $85 million more.</p>
        <p>The budget also counts on reducing the state work force by at least 5,000, through incentives for early retirement and a hiring freeze.</p>
        <p>The governor and lawmakers also agreed to shift many costs now borne by the state to the federal government through some unorthodox accounting. College scholarships, for instance, will be financed with $380 million from a surplus of federal welfare money, while special funds for the environment and health care were used to provide $400 million to help balance the budget.</p>
        <p>New York City's schools got a one-time infusion of about $200 million -- actually money the state had owed the city for years for school construction -- to help Mr. Bloomberg pay for a new contract with city teachers.</p>
        <p>Crime and Justice  AWAITING SIGNATURE OR VETO</p>
        <p>Would make it a felony to commit identity theft -- the unauthorized use of someone else's name, address, driver's license number, Social Security number, credit card numbers or A.T.M. codes.</p>
        <p>Would require fingerprinting of employees of the financial exchanges.</p>
        <p>Would require people designated as violent sexual predators to provide the addresses of their workplaces to the State Division of Criminal Justice Services.</p>

        <p>Would have eased the Rockefeller-era drug law penalties, and made drug treatment available more often as an alternative to prison.</p>
        <p>Would have abolished discretionary parole for all felons.</p>
        <p>Would have prohibited public access to any state documents compiled as part of an investigation into terrorism.</p>
        <p>Would have made it a felony, punishable by life in prison, to possess chemical or biological weapons.</p>
        <p>Would have allowed wiretaps on individuals, regardless of the phones they used, rather than wiretaps only on particular phone lines.</p>
        <p>Would have required that a member of the clergy who becomes aware of the sexual abuse of a minor report it to law enforcement officials.</p>
        <p>Would have given the state attorney general power to investigate and prosecute abuses in homes for the mentally ill.</p>
        <p>Would have prohibited any district attorney from prosecuting a case unless at least a part of the crime took place in that district attorney's county.</p>

        <p>LEGISLATION FAILED</p>
        <p>Would have banned smoking in restaurants, except in restaurant bars that are physically separated from the dining room or in separately ventilated smoking rooms.</p>
        <p>Would have raised the minimum wage to $6.75 an hour, from $5.15, by January 2004.</p>
        <p>Would have strengthened the code of conduct for, and state oversight of, certified public accountants.</p>
        <p>Would have raised workers' compensation benefits, for the first time in 10 years, by up to 50 percent.</p>
        <p>Would have extended unemployment benefits to 39 weeks from 26 weeks.</p>
        <p>Would have prohibited companies and partnerships from discriminating based on sex in fees paid for contract services.</p>

        <p>AWAITING SIGNATURE OR VETO</p>
        <p>Would allow auto rental companies to sell their customers short-term insurance policies, called collision damage waivers, which are banned in New York but permitted in every other state.</p>
        <p>Would prohibit the sale of children's clothing with drawstrings that extend more than three inches from the garment when it is expanded.</p>
        <p>Would ban the use of dog or cat fur or flesh in any manufactured goods.</p>
        <p>Would ban the use of monomeric methyl methacrylate, which is used on fingernails, in beauty salons.</p>
        <p>Would permit businesses with beer and wine licenses to sell soju, a Korean vodka-like liquor, for consumption on the premises.</p>
        <p>LEGISLATION FAILED</p>
        <p>Would have prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in employment, housing and other areas.</p>
        <p>Would have lengthened the period during which an insurer can challenge a claim under the state's no-fault insurance law, which automatically pays up to $50,000 for medical expenses for each party injured.</p>
        <p>Would have renewed and strengthened rent regulations that are set to expire next year.</p>
        <p>Would have given cities the option of granting disabled people the same protection against apartment rent increases that senior citizens have.</p>

        <p>LEGISLATION FAILED</p>
        <p>Would have renewed financing for the state's bankrupt Superfund program to clean up toxic-waste sites, and would have created a program to address less severely polluted sites, known as brownfields.</p>
        <p>Would have required that all diesel fuel sold in New York be low in sulfur, a chemical that contributes to air pollution and acid rain.</p>
        <p>Would have provided rules for granting environmental permits to proposed new power plants or for overhauls of existing plants, to replace a law that will expire at the end of the year.</p>
        <p>Would have established security standards for power plants and transmission lines.</p>
        <p>Would have given whistle-blowers at nuclear power plants protection from retaliation.</p>
        <p>Would have restricted power plant emissions of two pollutants, carbon dioxide and mercury, for the first time, and would have tightened existing limits on two other pollutants, nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide.</p>
        <p>Education  LEGISLATION ENACTED</p>
        <p>Gives New York City's mayor the power to appoint the schools chancellor, and expands the Board of Education to 13 members, from 7, increasing the number of mayoral appointees to 7, from 2. Also abolishes the 32 community school boards, effective June 2003, and directs the Legislature to create some other mechanism for parental involvement in school governance.</p>
        <p>Requires the City University of New York to charge students who are resident immigrants and live in New York the same tuition as other in-state students, not the higher rate charged to out-of-state residents.</p>
        <p>Permits immigrants who are permanent residents to become certified teachers without becoming citizens.</p>
        <p>Provides college scholarships to surviving immediate family members and dependents of people killed or seriously injured in the Sept. 11 attacks, in an amount equal to the full cost of tuition and housing at a State University of New York campus, and expands an existing state scholarship program for children and spouses of all firefighters, peace officers and emergency medical technicians killed in the line of duty.</p>
        <p>Health Care  LEGISLATION ENACTED</p>

        <p>LEGISLATION FAILED</p>
        <p>Would have lowered the threshold for a drunken-driving charge from a blood-alcohol level of .08, from .10, and would have increased penalties for drunken driving.</p>
        <p>Would have increased to 75, from 50, the number of intersections where New York City is allowed to have cameras that automatically photograph drivers who run red lights.</p>
        <p>Government and Elections  LEGISLATION ENACTED</p>
        <p>Drew new district boundaries for the Legislature and Congress, to reflect the 2000 Census, which required the reduction of New York's delegation in the House of Representatives to 29 seats, from 31, and increased the size of the State Senate to 62 seats, from 61.</p>
        <p>Postponed the collection of signatures for candidates to get on this year's ballot by two weeks, because of delays in enacting a redistricting plan.</p>
        <p>LEGISLATION FAILED</p>
        <p>Would have imposed significant restrictions on campaign finance, including lowering contribution limits and abolishing soft- money donations.</p>
