        <p>UNCOMMON CARRIERS</p>
        <p>By John McPhee.</p>
        <p>248 pp. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. $24.</p>
        <p>Even though it has increasingly upstaged poetry and fiction, most book-length journalism is perishable. We drink in the latest gossip about who's up or down in Washington or the latest account of the Iraq war gone awry, but a decade or two down the road, such information will be subsumed in works of history.</p>
        <p>The New Journalism of the 1960's and 70's -- articles and books by Tom Wolfe, Hunter Thompson and others -- made the biggest collective splash in recent American nonfiction, and certainly enlarged our idea of what the genre could do. The best of it may endure, but, 50 or 100 years hence, will people still be amused by Thompson's psychedelic ramblings or the early Wolfe's strings of exclamation points? More lasting, I think, as a grand pointillist mural of our time and place as expressed in the lives of an encyclopedic range of people, will be the books of John McPhee.</p>
        <p>For one thing, there are more of them. McPhee has now written, if you count two anthologies of excerpts from a variety of his work, an astonishing 29 books, while some of the most notable New Journalists lapsed into silence. Truman Capote never published another substantial nonfiction book after ''In Cold Blood,'' nor Michael Herr after his remarkable ''Dispatches.'' McPhee, however, has steadily averaged close to a book a year. Some of us for whom it's a struggle to get a book out every four or five years feel he should be prosecuted under the Fair Labor Standards Act.</p>
        <p>McPhee's choice of subjects is driven by certain personal predilections. Among other things, he is drawn to geology (four books), the practitioners of dying crafts (''The Survival of the Bark Canoe''), eccentrics (''The Headmaster'') and the American wilderness and those trying to save it (''Encounters With the Archdruid''). He also has found wonderfully fertile terrain by simply doing things that small boys dream of. For what other thread connects his flying with a bush pilot, hanging out with blimp enthusiasts, or going on maneuvers with the Swiss Army?</p>
        <p>This is also the theme that ties together ''Uncommon Carriers,'' almost all of which, like McPhee's previous books, first appeared as New Yorker articles. Small boys dream of being the driver of a giant tractor trailer that towers over the family car, or of piloting a ship, or (most of all in my day) of being a railroad engineer. Three portraits of people at work in these professions are the core of this new collection, which includes several shorter pieces also related to transportation: one about a pond in France where sea captains pay $15,000 for a weeklong ship-handling course using scale models, one retracing Thoreau's canoe journey on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers and one about the innards of United Parcel Service. (U.P.S., it turns out, not only whisks packages from suppliers to you through its centralized sorting facility with 122 miles of computerized conveyor belts and monorails, but actually is many of those suppliers as well -- quietly operating vast warehouses and workshops for corporate clients who want you to think that they themselves are attending to your orders for live lobsters, socks or repairs to your laptop.)</p>
        <p>Could McPhee have said something about what our expectation of overnight delivery of everything says about us? Or about the effects of diesel trucks or strip-mined coal (the contents of the train he rides) on global warming? Yes, definitely -- although he might reply by saying that he has amply defended the natural world in other books, that his retracing of Thoreau's steps honors the quintessential pre-overnight man and that his concern here is to shed light on some of the infrastructure jobs we take for granted.</p>
        <p>Each of these professions has its own language. Every coal train, for example, has a name; from the name of CTSBT, in whose cab McPhee rides, we can tell that it's on its way to Wyoming's Black Thunder mine to pick up coal for a plant in the Tennessee Valley. Some barges being pushed up the Illinois River are lashed together by inch-thick cable in 76 places: ''scissor wires, jockey wires, fore-and-afts, double-ups, three-part backing breasts, three-part towing breasts.'' The highway patrol officers watching for speeding truckers are known variously as diesel bears, local bears, air bears, and sugar bears (women).</p>
        <p>The people who drive these various contraptions (a 19,000-ton coal train, incidentally, may be the largest moving object on dry land) love their work. ''Towboating,'' says Tom Armstrong, chain-smoking captain of the tug on which McPhee travels the Illinois River, ''it grows on you like a wart. . . . See what I'm sayin'?'' Don Ainsworth, strongly opinionated collector of leather boots made from every animal from anteater to water buffalo, with whom McPhee crosses the country in the cab of a chemical tanker truck, so loves ''manicuring the ship'' -- the mirror-like sheen of his stainless steel tank -- that he pays extra to have it washed in deionized water that leaves no spots.</p>
        <p>All these men take immense pride in their skill. For Ainsworth, it means being able to descend the Laramie Range without ever putting a foot on the brake pedal, controlling his speed almost entirely by downshifting into the right sequence of 18 gears. For Armstrong and the fellow pilot with whom he alternates shifts, it means being able to maneuver, against a tricky current, a group of barges a thousand feet long between some bridge piers with only five feet to spare on each side. For Scott Davis, it means, when his train nearly a mile and a half long is passing over a hill, knowing how to simultaneously apply the brakes at one end and extra power at the other.</p>
        <p>WE often read about people in glamorous professions -- surgeons, actors, musicians, writers -- but so seldom about those who do the jobs we all depend on, those who transport raw materials on river barges, or haul the coal that generates electricity. If the human race survives another century or two, many of these jobs will vanish (they're already talking about running trains by remote control), and McPhee's work will provide an invaluable record of how those primitive people back in 2006, however heedless they were of what they were doing to their planet, treasured their bygone crafts.</p>
        <p>McPhee turned 75 this year, and seems not to have slackened his pace; for part of his retracing-Thoreau journey he paddled a canoe upstream on a fast-flowing river no longer slowed by the locks it had in Thoreau's day. I hope he'll be taking us for rides on some more uncommon carriers at 85, perhaps a space station or a Mars rover or a submersible looking at what we've done to the ocean floor. These seem some of the few places he hasn't yet explored.</p>
