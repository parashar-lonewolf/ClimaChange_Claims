        <p>AS few as 500 or so people, trekking out of Africa 140,000 years ago, may have populated the rest of the globe. These estimates are derived from a novel kind of archeology, one that depends not on pick and shovel but on delving into the capacious archive of the human genome.</p>
        <p>Dates and numbers based solely on genetic evidence are unlikely to be fully accepted until historians and archeologists have had their say. But they afford a glimpse of the rich historical information embedded in the DNA of each human cell. Because of rapid methods for sequencing, or reading off, the chemical letters of DNA, geneticists are gathering reams of data about human populations. But methods of interpreting the information are still a work in progress.</p>
        <p>At a conference on human evolution last month at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island, population geneticists reported new analyses confirming that the origin of the human species is to be sought in Africa. They also discussed other inferences that can be teased out of genetic data, like estimates of the size and location of ancestral populations and the timing of the migrations out of Africa.</p>
        <p>The geneticists' calculations depend on a number of assumptions, and tend to yield dates that have wide margins of error, a source of frustration to others at the conference. ''Why should we worry about their dates?'' one archeologist said to another. ''It's they who should worry about our dates.''</p>
        <p>Still, a method that from a few drops of blood can reach into the dawn of human history is hard to ignore, whatever its present imperfections.</p>
        <p>Over all, the genetic variation found among people is very small compared with that among most other species; humans evolved too recently to have accumulated any significant amount of genetic change or mutations. Still, people are far from being clones and there is a lot of variation for geneticists to track, much of which was present at the emergence of the species.</p>
        <p>Movements of populations have been studied in the past by comparing the cell's working parts, the proteins whose structure is coded in DNA. But a coding region of DNA cannot change very much, since mutations will alter the protein it specifies, often with fatal consequences for the individual. Most of the genome, however, is composed of noncoding DNA, where mutations make no difference to the individual since most noncoding DNA has no evident purpose. Mutations in noncoding DNA are ideal for the population geneticist, since they accumulate at a fairly regular rate, yielding the best data as to the diversity and age of different populations.</p>
        <p>One result that stands out from genetic samples of people around the world is that sub-Saharan African populations possess greater genetic diversity than non-Africans. Non-Africans retain just a subset of this diversity, as would be expected when a smaller group breaks away from a founding population, taking only a sample of the full range of genetic variation.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mark Stoneking, a population geneticist at Pennsylvania State University, estimated at the conference that the non-Africans had split away from the main human population in Africa 137,000 years ago, give or take 15,000 years. His findings were based on sampling 34 populations around the world and analyzing genetic elements called Alu insertions, small and apparently useless pieces of DNA that have gradually spread throughout the human genome.</p>
        <p>The substantial diversity of Alu insertions among African populations suggested that Africans maintained a larger population size through the prehistorical period than those who emigrated, Dr. Stoneking said, since small populations tend to lose their genetic diversity over time.</p>
        <p>The original human population is thought to have numbered a few thousand individuals. Studies of mitochondrial DNA, a special category of genetic material that is inherited just through the mother's line, have put the founding human population at a mere 10,000 individuals. Using genetic markers from the chromosomes, Dr. Sarah A. Tishkoff, an evolutionary biologist at Penn State, said she and her colleagues had calculated that the long-term early population was considerably larger, from 23,000 to 447,000 individuals.</p>
        <p>The home of the ancestral human population in Africa is not yet known but some signs point toward East Africa. The Turkana people of Kenya show the greatest diversity of any known group in their mitochondrial DNA, said Dr. Elizabeth Watson of Massey University in New Zealand. This type of genetic material is exempt from the shuffling that creates new individuals and changes only by collecting mutations over time.</p>
        <p>Dr. Watson said that other peoples of East Africa also had high diversity in their mitochondrial DNA, and that the region of the highest diversity was usually indicative of a species' place of origin. Since fossil remains of early human ancestors have been found at Lake Turkana in Kenya, her proposal is plausible, other experts said, although more diverse African groups may turn up after wider sampling.</p>
        <p>Dr. Tishkoff believes that the African and non-African populations may have separated in several stages. She has found that the falashas, Ethiopian Jews who now live in Israel but are believed to be like other Ethiopians genetically, show genetic diversity intermediate between that of Africans and non-Africans, suggesting they may be descendants of a group that moved away from the main sub-Saharan population and lived perhaps in northeast Africa. Today's non-African populations could have originated from the northeast African group,  carrying off even lesser genetic diversity.</p>
        <p>There may have been more than one migration out of Africa but if so all probably came from northeast African since the pattern of variation among non-Africans suggests that they all descend from a single ancestral gene pool, Dr. Tishkoff said.</p>
        <p>The genetic diversity of non-Africans is so much smaller that the group leaving Africa could have consisted of as few as 200 to 500 individuals, Dr. Tishkoff and colleagues estimated, although, of course, the actual numbers may have been greater.</p>
        <p>There seems to have been one principal migration of modern humans out of Africa, but geneticists have picked up traces of at least one earlier exodus. Dr. Stoneking believes from his Alu insertion study that peoples now found only in parts of Australasia are closely related to the ancestral human population and may have reached the far Pacific through a tropical route, to be largely displaced by a later wave of people coming through Central Asia.</p>
        <p>A family tree of human populations can be drawn up from analysis of mitochondrial DNA, which because it accumulates mutations quite rapidly is useful for studying recent evolutionary events. The pattern of mutations in mitochondrial DNA can be traced back to an ancestral mutation pattern, whose date can be estimated by various means. Dr. Douglas C. Wallace of Emory University in Atlanta said that the age of all African mitochondrial DNA's could be set at 130,000 to 170,000 years ago, that of Asians at 50,000 to 70,000 years and the root of the European lineages at 40,000 to 50,000 years ago.</p>
        <p>Native Americans, by the evidence of their mitochondrial DNA, fall into four genetic groups, three of which can also be found in most present-day Siberians, Dr. Wallace said.</p>
        <p>Population geneticists have started to analyze the male or Y chromosome, which like mitochondrial DNA is a useful genetic marker because it largely escapes the reshuffling of genes in each generation. The reason is that the Y chromosome exchanges genetic information just at its tips with its counterpart, the X chromosome, leaving the main body of the Y to change only by successive random alterations in its DNA. As with mitochondrial DNA, plotting these random mutations yields a tree with the oldest mutation at the trunk and younger mutations forming successive branches.</p>
        <p>Mitochondrial DNA and the Y chromosome should tell more or less the same story of population history unless men and women did significant travel without each other. From studying the Y chromosome of 1,500 men around the world, Dr. Michael Hammer of the University of Arizona said the family tree of present mutations started around 185,000 years ago, a date similar to that of the ancestral mitochondrial DNA.</p>
        <p>But unlike the mitochondrial DNA tree, which mirrors the migration of people out of Africa and around the world, Y chromosome DNA shows evidence of a male migration from Asia back into Africa. This finding implies ''that males dispersed more than females during these major population movements,'' Dr. Hammer said.</p>
        <p>The new findings described at the conference, buttressed by the recent sequencing of mitochondrial DNA from the fossil bone of a Neanderthal, support the belief of many paleoanthropologists in the out-of-Africa theory. This is the view that modern humans emerged from Africa and displaced, without interbreeding, the archaic hominids like Neanderthals that had populated the world during earlier emigrations. Dr. Milford Wolpoff of the University of Michigan staunchly upheld his alternative view that modern humans evolved from Neanderthals in Europe and from other archaic hominids in different parts of the world. At least for the moment, however, he seems to be in an embattled minority.</p>
        <p>Remains of anatomically modern humans have been found from as long as 200,000 years ago in Africa but some archeologists, like Dr. Richard G. Klein of Stanford University, distinguish between anatomically modern and behaviorally modern people. A suite of new artifacts, like the making of art objects, appears in the archeological record in Africa 50,000 years ago and a few thousand years later in Asia and Europe. ''There was some kind of Rubicon that was crossed 40,000 to 50,000 years ago,'' Dr. Klein said, suggesting that the Rubicon was a neurological change that permitted the development of language.</p>
        <p>Another archeologist, Dr. Stanley Ambrose of the University of Illinois at Urbana, agreed with Dr. Klein on the date of the change but said that language had developed much earlier. He argued that the behavioral changes seen at 50,000 years ago reflected a population recovery after an adverse climate change, particularly a deep global cold snap caused by the gigantic volcanic eruption of Mount Toba in Sumatra 73,500 years ago.</p>
        <p>Population genetics is at its most fascinating in exploring the origin of humans, but can also be brought to bear on more recent events like the peopling of the Americas or the prehistory of populations in Asia. During an expedition across Central Asia last summer, Dr. Spencer Wells of Stanford University collected blood from speakers of 32 different languages in the region. Analyzing the DNA in his laboratory, he found that many Turkish speakers carry a harmless mutation that first arose among the Indo-Iranian peoples who lived north of the Caspian Sea some 5,000 years ago, as well as another genetic marker found among Mongoloids.</p>
        <p>A southward migration of the Indo-Iranian speakers into India began the spread of the Indo-European languages, which include English. There must also have been an eastward migration, Dr. Wells believes, that reached the Altai Mountains north of Mongolia, and from a fusion with Mongoloid peoples of the Altai, the Turkish-speaking peoples emerged.</p>
