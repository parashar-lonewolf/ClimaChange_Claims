        <p>With President Bush's signing of the landmark treaty on climate today, the world's nations have embarked on the lengthy and uncertain road of trying to avert the feared warming of the globe from the continued buildup of of heat-trapping gases.</p>
        <p>The White House has long taken a cautious approach to the threat of global warming, and weakened the treaty targets sought by the Europeans. But today Mr. Bush called for speedier action on the treaty, and the 12 countries of the European Community prepared to go beyond the treaty's mild requirements.</p>
        <p>In a pledge expected to be signed Saturday, the 12 will agree to stabilize emissions of the chief heat-trapping gas, carbon dioxide, at 1990 levels by 2000.</p>
        <p>Though critics here continue to chide Mr. Bush and his Administration for weakening the treaty, many experts see the accord as a long-term framework that can become a forceful instrument for controlling heat-trapping gases.</p>
        <p>"The foundation for meeting the challenge is there, but it needs the mortar and the bricks to get beyond the basement," said Scott Hajost, a former official of the Environmental Protection Agency now with the Environmental Defense Fund.</p>
        <p>On signing the treaty, Mr. Bush immediately challenged other industrial nations to join the United States by Jan. 1 in laying out detailed plans for controlling emissions. The proposal, he said, is intended to accelerate the treaty's practical effects.  A Question of Pace</p>
        <p>But Margaret Brusasco-Mackenzie, head of the environment division of the European Commission, said Europe was undertaking a series of programs that would take time to be adopted.  "We have a deadline for the end of the century," she said. "That is our deadline, and that is the one we intend to meet."</p>
        <p>Some Governments, like Germany's, have committed themselves to reduce carbon dioxide emissions after 2000 to levels even lower than those of 1990. The Bush Administration, by contrast, successfully avoided setting targets and timetables because of costs.</p>
        <p>Washington's fears may be ungrounded. Several experts, including some in the Administration, say the United States economy, simply for competitive reasons, is already improving its energy efficiency so rapidly that it could outstrip the European timetables.</p>
        <p>One United States official here even predicted that with no cost to the economy, the United States might be able to commit itself to stronger measures "as soon as that becomes compelling enough," perhaps in two years.</p>
        <p>"I think the world will move beyond what the convention requires," said William A. Nitze, a former State Department official who left his job as chief negotiator on the treaty some months ago after disagreeing with the Administration. Mr. Nitze is now head of the Alliance to Save Energy, a nonprofit coalition that promotes investment in energy efficiency.</p>
        <p>He said the treaty "will lead to very rapid progress, because when countries really look at the options, they are going to find lots of ways to reduce emissions, just as we have in this country."</p>
        <p>The Administration has compiled a list of completed or imminent actions that it calculates will hold emissions to very nearly the level favored by the Europeans.  What the U.S. Is Doing</p>
        <p>The several dozen measures include tougher efficiency standards for appliances and equipment, incentives for electric utilities to improve efficiency instead of building new power plants and Government encouragement of alternative-fuel vehicles.</p>
        <p>"That doesn't include any of the things that are going on at the state or local level, or individual actions utilities are taking to improve efficiency, or any other initiatives we take between now and the year 2000," said Alden Meyer, the director of the program on climate change and energy of the Union of Concerned Scientists, who is attending the Earth Summit.</p>
        <p>The drive for energy efficiency "is moving fast enough to allow us to make absolute reductions in emissions in most of the industrialized countries," he said, "and I think the United States is probably likely to exceed the European goals, even though we won't commit to them." An Optimist on Ratification</p>
        <p>Nearly 150 governments will have signed the treaty by the end of the conference on Sunday. Ratification could prove harder, given the vagaries of domestic politics.</p>
        <p>But Michael Zammit-Cutajar of Malta, the executive secretary of the international negotiating committee that produced the treaty, said the ratification process was off to "a flying start." He said he expected the treaty to be in force within two years.</p>
        <p>The agreement, a product of 15 months of intensive negotiations between 143 nations that ended last month in New York, is remarkable in that it tackles a danger whose full dimension is unclear and unproved.</p>
        <p>Scientists know that greenhouse gases, so called because they trap heat in the atmosphere, have been rising steadily since the Industrial Revolution. Though they fear the climate could become disastrously hotter some time in the next century, the state of their art does not yet enable them to make accurate predictions. The Climate Numbers</p>
        <p>An international group of scientists convened by the United Nations predicts that if human societies continue to spew forth greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane at the current rate, the Earth's average surface temperature will rise by 3 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the next century. The average temperature has risen by only 9 degrees since the depths of the last ice age, which ended 11,000 years ago.</p>
        <p>Climatologists have no clear proof that human-induced warming has begun. Early signs are easily smothered by the wide natural swings in climate. The 1980's were an unusually warm decade, and 1990 and 1991 the warmest years since global record-keeping started in the mid-19th century. But even those peaks could be natural swings.</p>
        <p>A small amount of human-induced warming might not be so bad. Crops would grow faster, for example. But if the warming is as great as some members of the United Nations science panel say it could be, then ice caps and glaciers could melt, causing seas to rise and flood coastal areas and some island nations. Some studies also predict violent storms and destructive droughts.</p>
        <p>Even if human societies and agriculture managed to adjust, many scientists fear that natural ecosystems would fail to adapt fast enough, and many would collapse, with a widespread loss of species.</p>
        <p>Signers of the treaty are to examine one another's performance six months after the it goes into force and again in 1998 at the latest. The process, described by Mr. Zammit-Cutajar of Malta, the coordinator of the talks, as peer review in which every country must put its cards on the table for inspection by everybody else, is the principal means of enforcement for the treaty. KEY ELEMENTS OF THE CLIMATE TREATY Overall objective:</p>
        <p>To stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous interference by humans with the climate system. This level should be achieved soon enough to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to insure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner. National requirements:</p>
        <p>* All parties are required to formulate and regularly update national programs to mitigate climate change by addressing human-generated emissions of greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>* Industrialized countries are required to limit their emissions of greenhouse gases, to protect greenhouse gas sinks like forests and to demonstrate that they are taking steps toward meeting these objectives.</p>
        <p>* Within six months of when the treaty takes effect and periodically thereafter, all parties are required to report on what they have done "with the aim of returning individually or jointly to their 1990 levels" of emissions.</p>
        <p>* Industrialized countries are required to help finance and provide technology to developing countries to meet general commitments, initially through the Global Environmental Facility, a new international aid program.</p>
        <p>* Periodic review of progress and scientific knowledge about climate change is required with a view toward taking whatever action is necessary.</p>
