        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You identify two essential options for New Orleans: restore the city by overhauling its levees or allow it to fall neglectfully into abandonment.</p>
        <p>While the American public should indeed come clean about its intentions for New Orleans, there are more alternatives than those you propose. We should also consider the feasibility of re-establishing New Orleans in a more secure location, one less vulnerable to the essentially inevitable threats of a warming climate and rising sea levels.</p>

        <p>You identify two essential options for New Orleans: restore the city by overhauling its levees or allow it to fall neglectfully into abandonment.</p>
        <p>While the American public should indeed come clean about its intentions for New Orleans, there are more alternatives than those you propose. We should also consider the feasibility of re-establishing New Orleans in a more secure location, one less vulnerable to the essentially inevitable threats of a warming climate and rising sea levels.</p>
        <p>Relocation would, of course, be a complicated process, and it would be difficult to avoid building an anodyne rendition of the storied city that now sits, in large part, as a rotting ruin.</p>
        <p>New Orleans owed much of its charm to a unique brand of bawdy spontaneity that is inimical with choreographed planning. Many people with deep emotional bonds to the Crescent City would dismiss relocation as tantamount to capitulation.</p>
        <p>Despite these challenges, re-establishment could provide both residents and visitors with a vision for a ''new'' New Orleans founded on fortitude, resilience and endurance.</p>
