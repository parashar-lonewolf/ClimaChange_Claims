        <p>Vice President Al Gore held his first news conference in 67 days today, defending his call for the release of oil from the government's stockpiles and vowing that he would ''confront friend and foe alike'' over the marketing of violent entertainment to children, despite the millions in donations he receives from Hollywood.</p>
        <p>In particular, Mr. Gore tried to brush off criticism from Gov. George W. Bush, who pointed out that as recently as February, the vice president had resisted using the oil stockpile to reduce prices. Today, Mr. Bush called Mr. Gore a ''flip-flopper,'' saying his proposal to tap into the reserves was a political ploy.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore said: ''The situation is very different today. It's not fair to the middle-class families of this country to stand by and do nothing.'' He added that the oil-producing countries had not kept their promise to lower prices and that inventories were falling.</p>
        <p>Oil prices dominated the 31-minute news conference here, near Pittsburgh. Mr. Gore spoke to reporters after holding a discussion with two dozen people at a union hall belonging to the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers about their difficulties in paying higher prices for home-heating fuel.</p>
        <p>On other topics, Mr. Gore said he was not nervous about the coming debates, but he was incredulous when a reporter asked whether he was confident he had the election locked up. ''I don't have an overconfident bone in my body,'' he said. ''This is very much out there to be won or lost, this is a jump ball right now.''</p>
        <p>He sought to raise expectations about his opponent's debating skills. Mr. Bush, he said, was ''a very good debater and has won all of the debates he's been in that I know of.'' He mentioned Mr. Bush's debate against Gov. Ann W. Richards of Texas in 1994. ''He was supposed to be slaughtered in that,'' Mr. Gore mused. ''She's certainly a better debater than I am, she's got a very quick wit and silver tongue and is just smart as a whip, and he beat her in that debate, so put that in your formula.''</p>
        <p>He denied that he had privately cozied up to Hollywood executives while chastising them in public over marketing practices. ''That's just not true,'' he said. ''I don't care if somebody supports me or opposes me, I'm going to take them on on this issue.'' He added, ''I'm going to confront friend and foe alike to get this change.''</p>
        <p>He was asked about an antireligious joke told Monday night at his Hollywood fund-raiser. He said he was not aware of it but added that often he finds himself watching television or a movie and something offensive occurs. But, he added, ''jumping up every time that happens would be kind of a constant undertaking.''</p>
        <p>The vice president took every opportunity to shape the discussion at the news conference and at the event to his populist campaign theme: that he would fight ''for the people'' while Mr. Bush, a former oil executive, is so beholden to big oil that he would do nothing to stem prices.</p>
        <p>''This is just a straight difference of opinion here,'' Mr. Gore said. ''We stand in different places, we see this differently, and we fight for different people.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has called for renewed oil and gas drilling as well as personal diplomacy with oil-producing nations to lower prices while arguing that the government's stockpile should be tapped only for strategic purposes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore challenged the notion that the reserve was held for strategic purposes. ''I've been a part of the discussions on the strategic reserve since the days when it was first established,'' Mr. Gore said, ''and actually, the purposes that justify release are many and varied and in fact it's not just as narrow as that.''</p>
        <p>However, the Web site for the oil stockpile does not refer to it as a means of regulating prices, and instead calls it ''the nation's first line of defense against an interruption in petroleum supplies'' and ''a significant deterrent to oil import cutoffs and a key tool of foreign policy.''</p>
        <p>The vice president took fierce exception to Mr. Bush's desire to drill for oil in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. ''I am not in favor of putting fragile parts of our environment at risk in order to get tiny new amounts when the price is going up sky high and the production is being artificially cut back elsewhere,'' Mr. Gore said. ''We do not have to sacrifice our environment and our environmental treasures in order to satisfy the appetite of big oil companies to go into new areas.''</p>
        <p>In response to Mr. Bush's charge that oil and gas prices were climbing because the Clinton administration had no coherent energy policy, Mr. Gore said the blame lay with Republicans in Congress. ''They have blocked and stalled and prevented the investments in renewable energy and the development of our own natural resources here that we have advocated year after year,'' he said. ''I want to put this on the front burner in the midst of this campaign, in part to seek a mandate to get the next Congress to act.''</p>
        <p>He suggested that the release of oil could be more of a psychological move than one of immediate benefit to consumers. He said he did not know when consumers would feel relief and would not specify a price he thought fair. ''I think we'll learn a lot from this, if we do it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore had not held a news conference since July 17. The 67-day stretch surpassed his previous record earlier this year of 62 days without a news conference. During this period, in which his campaign has tightly controlled his appearances and tried to produce a single message of the day, he has climbed in the polls. But he said today that the lack of news conferences was not a sign that he would not hold regular news conferences as president.</p>
        <p>Gore associates said he made himself available today to end the increasing number of stories that he was inaccessible. Still, asked if he would hold a news conference once a week, he avoided answering. ''We'll talk about that at the next one,'' he said.</p>
        <p>AL GORE  In His Own Words</p>
        <p>Remarks yesterday to members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in Vanport, Pa.:</p>
        <p>''I think it's time to stand up to the apologists for big oil. I reject an agenda that is of big oil, by big oil and for big oil. I reject the agenda of those who say, 'Don't even offer a plan, do nothing about it.' These prices are skyrocketing. It's hurting small businesses, it's hurting those on fixed income, it's hurting young families, and the prospect for even higher prices ahead is going to cause even more trouble unless we act now. We are not helpless. We can act. We have tools at our disposal. And I'm calling for them to be used. . . .</p>
        <p>''We need to develop our own domestic resources. We need to develop new technologies so that we can burn all of our fuels more efficiently and more cleanly. We need to create millions of good new jobs in states like Pennsylvania with workers like those here at the I.B.E.W. by getting out in front of the market for these new boilers and new furnaces and new cars and trucks and buses and revamped power plants and new technologies that help us to conserve more energy.''</p>
