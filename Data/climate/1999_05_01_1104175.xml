        <p>The US Generating Company has asked New York State for permission to build a gas-fired power plant near the western shore of the Hudson River in Green County, an area of breathtaking natural beauty 120 miles north of New York City.

        <p>The US Generating Company has asked New York State for permission to build a gas-fired power plant near the western shore of the Hudson River in Green County, an area of breathtaking natural beauty 120 miles north of New York City. From an engineering standpoint, it is a good place to put  a power plant. From any other perspective -- esthetic, environmental, historical -- it is the  wrong place. Gov. George Pataki should deny the application. Failure to do so would set a poor precedent and tarnish his reputation for environmental stewardship.</p>
        <p>This will not be an easy decision, as even conservationists concede. In this new age of utility deregulation, aimed at encouraging competition in an industry long dominated by local monopolies, out-of-state power companies are romancing New Yorkers with promises of more efficient plants and lower electricity bills. Like any smart governor, Mr. Pataki wants these benefits.</p>
        <p>US Generating has a commendable environmental record, and the gas-fired plant it proposes would emit far fewer of the pollutants that cause smog or contribute to global warming than New York's older oil and coal-fired plants. In terms of costs, the site itself makes perfect sense. It lies at the confluence of the Iroquois natural gas pipeline, power lines that can carry electricity to New York City and New England, and the river, which can provide water for the plant's cooling systems.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the site is also directly across from Olana, the ornate 19th-century Moorish mansion built by Frederic E. Church, a central figure in the Hudson River School of painting. One expert has called Olana ''the most aesthetically and historically significant artist's residence in the United States'' -- significant not just for the house itself but for the landscape that inspired some of the artist's noblest works. The plant and its plumes of steam would disfigure that view, not only from Olana but from nearby parks and other historic homes.</p>
        <p>Critics also worry that the plant will harm fragile fish populations. The company insists that the plant will actually save fish by displacing older power plants along the river that suck in much more water. But the main fear is that the plant  will corrupt an irreplaceable piece of visual history, an outcome the Governor cannot want. As he  himself noted in his January State of the State Message, ''preserving the historic places that reunite us with our rich and glorious past is an obligation we must fulfill to the children of the future.''</p>
        <p>The final decision is largely controlled by Mr. Pataki, who appointed the six members of the siting board that will rule on the application, probably in October. The board is operating on a fast track mandated by a flawed 1992 law designed to encourage ''one-stop shopping'' by utility companies. This law does not require companies to offer alternative sites, thus requiring an up-or-down vote on the company's preferred site.</p>
        <p>Opponents of the plant have taken hope from a ruling by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency that the siting board has no power to issue permits for discharges into the air and water that the company will need to begin operation. But that problem could be fixed by new legislation in Albany. The only certain way to stop the plant is for the board to vote it down. This is an important test. US Generating's facility would be New York's first new power plant in 20 years. There will be more to come. It is essential to establish the principle that the environment has a claim in these decisions.</p>
