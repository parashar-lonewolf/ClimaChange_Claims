        <p>As the nations of the world map a plan of action to preserve Earth's environment, their meetings have been bogged down by the old battles between the wealthy, industrial countries of the north and the poor, underdeveloped countries of the south.</p>
        <p>The disputes are mirrored in thick stacks of papers, 20,000 pages sent in by 121 governments, that are now being examined in an elegant villa on the outskirts of Geneva. They are lists of the world's green worries, each country's view of its most pressing environmental concerns.</p>
        <p>The papers form the substance of discussions here and at the United Nations headquarters in New York in preparation for the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, scheduled for June in Rio de Janeiro, exactly 20 years after an environmental conference in Stockholm.</p>
        <p>United Nations officials sorting through the reports here say that since the Stockholm meeting, governments have come a long way in thinking, arguing and absorbing the notion that the planet cannot cope with indefinite abuse. 'Give Us Money'</p>
        <p>But United Nations organizers here have expressed anguish because the meetings to prepare for Rio have revived the old clashes between rich and poor, this time in an environmental context.</p>
        <p>A United Nations official who has attended most planning sessions said much of the debate was confrontational, characterizing the message from developing countries as "Give us money; you are rich; we are poor." The official, a European, said there was no debate about what developing countries should do at home.</p>
        <p>"The language emphasizes more and more the need for a new international economic order," she said.</p>
        <p>At the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an organization of the 24 industrialized nations that are deeply involved in environmental planning, senior officials seem as gloomy.</p>
        <p>"People are despairing that the Rio meeting will be dominated by a North-South confrontation," said Bill Long, director of environment affairs at the organization. "We hoped we could forget about placing blame and work on problems together." Negotiating Tactics</p>
        <p>Representatives from developing countries make light of such accusations, saying their confrontational postures and language are only negotiating tactics to get much needed funds.</p>
        <p>"For the first time in more than a decade, the developing countries have an issue where they have some real leverage," said an official from a Caribbean nation. "They had none during the debt negotiations. But they are part of the environment, so they have leverage now. And they are using it. It's their negotiating strategy."</p>
        <p>Poorer nations, he said, see leverage because the north, the main polluter, wants them to cut emissions, stop deforesting and make other changes. But to adapt to those changes, they argue, they need funding and technology.</p>
        <p>The reports here are being used to draft an "Earth Charter" for the Rio summit meeting on making development more compatible with the environment. Organizers also hope for a binding treaty to cut emissions that can cause climate change and a similar treaty on the preservation of species. A Rising Awareness</p>
        <p>Since most of the reports have been prepared with the help of private organizations, they reflect how concern for the environment has over the last two decades galvanized thousands of citizens' groups and mobilized scientists, lawyers, economists and politicians who are pressing for change.</p>
        <p>Confrontation has been part of preparations for the summit meeting since the United Nations resolution in 1989 calling for it attributed the planet's environmental problems to "unsustainable production patterns" of the industrial countries.</p>
        <p>At first, planners wanted to hold the meeting in Stockholm, as in 1972. But Brazil, stung by intense international criticism over the large-scale destruction of its Amazon rainforest, lobbied to serve as host for the meeting and won enough backing.</p>
        <p>Brazil's purpose, officials said at the time, was to improve its image. Brazil and other developing nations also said that holding the conference in the third world was symbolically important and would help them put the blame for most environmental destruction and pollution back where it belonged, in the industrial world. The strategy has put rich countries on the defensive on a host of issues.</p>
        <p>A planned treaty to protect and manage the world's tropical forests, which are vital regulators of the global climate and which harbor most of the planet's species, has already been shelved. Brazil and other countries demanded that such a treaty be extended to all forests and had the word "tropical" removed.</p>
        <p>"By extending the debate to all forests, there was not enough time for a binding treaty," a United Nations official said. "The best we can hope for is a declaration to save the rainforests."</p>
        <p>Another planned high point of the summit meeting, a treaty to protect the world's animal and plant species, is being fundamentally changed. In the past, nature has always been considered part of the common heritage. But now developing countries want the convention to state that biological resources "are under a country's sovereignty" and are no longer "to be considered as a common heritage of humankind."</p>
        <p>Poor countries say this is part of their quest for equity. They have long complained that their contributions such as natural genes, or strains bred by farmers in the fields, have been reaped by foreign researchers or pharmaceutical companies for free while poor nations have to pay for seeds or other organisms protected by patents and licences elsewhere. There is still basic disagreement over how a country can profit from its biological resources. Rivalry for Western Funds</p>
        <p>The emerging rivalry for Western funds that many Africans and Latin Americans show toward Eastern Europe was one topic of debate here this week. Westerners said that every time a meeting document mentioned the need to give special attention to eastern Europe, the large bloc of developing nations wanted it crossed out.</p>
        <p>"The south sees eastern Europe as a drain on Western resources," an American official said. "They look at them as competitors for Western funds. But we see eastern Europe as a test case, a special opportunity to demonstrate quickly that you can have cleaner economic growth. If you can't do it there, where can you?"</p>
        <p>One way to dissolve the acrimony, Marjan van Giezen of the Netherlands said, is a pledge from the West to keep separate budgets and not to send eastern Europe any aid funds earmarked for the developing world.</p>
        <p>United Nations officials have been disappointed with the low profile of oil-rich Arab states. Several have not yet provided their reports, which were due in November. In December, when the United Nations tried to raise funds for a program to rehabilitate environmental damage in the Middle East that was not related to the Persian Gulf war, "not a single Arab state offered one penny," a senior official said. Some Arab delegates have said the environment is a task for the international community. Cooperation Is Cited</p>
        <p>As the summit meeting nears, delegates say the spirit of cooperation is improving somewhat in small work groups. "But in every plenary session, the north-south smokescreen is still up," Mrs. van Giezen said.</p>
        <p>Rich countries still feel strongly that population control deserves a more prominent place and more commitment. They see population problems as an issue inextricable from the environment. By the year 2000, when a billion more people will have been added to the planet, they argue, almost every environmental problem will be magnified.</p>
        <p>But many poor countries see demands to curb population growth as an infringement on their sovereignty. At first they kept population off the agenda and many remain reluctant to make population growth a key issue. "Population finally came in through the back door," a French delegate said. It was finally put on the agenda, she said, "but it's still very sensitive."</p>
        <p>The big question remains what to do about an ambitious agenda of some 800 pages, ranging from human settlements to the chemistry of the upper atmosphere. Organizers say it has been virtually impossible to draw the line in a summit meeting called Conference on Environment and Development.</p>
        <p>"The environment runs through everything, the interlinkage has given us gray hairs," said Lars Hyttinen, a Finnish economist and biologist who coordinates the country reports in Geneva.</p>
        <p>Maurice Strong, a Canadian who is Secretary General of the Rio summit meeting, has said that although unwieldy, the agenda serves to project the magnitude of the problems. Most proposals for action demand enormous transfers of money and technology from the industrial world to the developing world that would put almost all responsibility on the rich countries.</p>
        <p>They agree that there is a need for more funds but argue that their poorer partners must also commit themselves to a number of steps, like less wasteful use of resources, cut in military spending and slowing population growth. Mr. Strong has put the environment-related aid bill at $125 billion per year. Benefits of Gathering</p>
        <p>Cautious United Nations officials say that even if the summit meeting falls short of its goals, the gathering will have been worthwhile as a consciousness-raising effort, pushing environmental questions to the forefront among the public, into the press and into every government ministry.</p>
        <p>Even the preparation of the national reports, Mr. Hyttinen of Finland said, has already prompted intense discussion inside and outside governments. He said several Asian countries, including the Philippines and Sri Lanka had asked the public to send in suggestions, a move that set off regional and national debates.</p>
        <p>New Zealand's also called on citizens' and activist groups to participate. "It was a most interesting exercise," said a New Zealand official. "We never knew all those people existed."</p>
