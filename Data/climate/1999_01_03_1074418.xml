        <p>In Dealing With Baghdad, U.S. Takes a Long View  Nearly eight years after the 1991 Persian Gulf war started, Saddam Hussein is still shooting at American pilots and Washington still has no clear strategy for defeating him. And now, with the United Nations weapons inspectors gone from Iraq and unlikely to return, Mr. Hussein is free to build biological and chemical weapons without the world looking over his shoulder. Meanwhile, Iraq announced it would ban returning American and British inspectors.</p>
        <p>10</p>
        <p>American officials are casting their nets wide to find a credible opposition leader or perhaps a figurehead who might lead Iraq after Saddam Hussein, meeting even with a man who would be king.</p>
        <p>10</p>
        <p>Land of Uncertain Justice  Despite the defeat of the Khmer Rouge and international efforts to establish the rule of law, the jailing of two rights workers shows that Cambodia remains a land of arbitrary justice, where neither mass killers nor ordinary citizens can be quite sure what to expect.</p>
        <p>12</p>
        <p>Tensions Rising in Korea  North Korea seems to have grown more hard-line and militarized in recent months, and some experts fear a major security crisis on the Korean Peninsula later this year.</p>
        <p>13</p>
        <p>Nigeria Reinforces Delta  Hundreds of Nigerian troops reinforced positions in the oil-producing Niger Delta, where as many as 19 youths have been reported killed in protests to demand a greater share of the region's oil wealth, residents said.</p>

        <p>Opposition May Lessen To Global Warming Treaty  Even as a proposed treaty on global warming faces an uncertain future in the Senate, big companies are maneuvering to push through a bill to give them credit for any reductions in waste gases that they achieve before the treaty takes effect in 2008. The legislation would potentially moderate opposition to the treaty.</p>

        <p>Oregon Health Plan's Woes  Nearly five years ago, Oregon established a plan to give the poor health insurance but require them to join health maintenance organizations. With that, the state calculated, it could afford to provide basic care for all the poor. But now the state has abandoned that goal.</p>

        <p>Cruise Industry Regulation  A long inquiry by the Government discovered a fleet-wide conspiracy within Royal Caribbean Cruises to save millions of dollars by dumping oily waste into the ocean. A review of the criminal investigation and details of another dumping incident show the difficulty of policing the booming cruise industry.</p>

        <p>Childhood Cancer Survivors  Childhood cancer has been transformed from killer to curable disease. But thankful though they and their families are that they are alive, the growing legion of survivors are discovering that the miracle has not been without a price.</p>

        <p>First 1999 Storm  A giant storm howled across the Midwest from the Canadian border to the Gulf of Mexico, grounding most flights in Chicago and St. Louis, knocking out power, and threatening a foot of snow or more in Northern states.</p>

        <p>Sprinkler Mystery Remains In a Fatal Brooklyn Fire  Investigators may never find out who turned off the sprinkler system in a Brooklyn high-rise building where three firefighters died in a fire last month. But an equally troubling mystery is how the system's uselessness could have gone undiscovered, probably for years.</p>
        <p>23</p>
        <p>Ghost Fleet Is Vanishing  Hundreds of hulks of sailing ships, tugboats and other craft lie sunken in the mud of New York Harbor, but they are vanishing under the press of shoreline redevelopment. The United States Army Corps of Engineers has drawn up a list of 75 historically significant vessels to be studied and possibly salvaged before all the hulks are cleared out to prevent drifting timbers from threatening passing ships.</p>
        <p>23</p>
        <p>Stadium Seating at the Movies  To hear moviegoers tell it, a universal gripe is becoming less common in the metropolitan region thanks to the latest in theater design: stadium-style seating that puts patrons head and shoulders above the row in front of them.</p>
