        <p>Representatives from more than 160 nations agreed early today on a document that commits the industrial nations of the Northern Hemisphere to help the poorer countries of the South develop in a way that will not damage the environment.</p>
        <p>The document, in draft form, was the only full accord to come out of five weeks of negotiations here in preparation for a major international environmental conference in Rio de Janeiro in June.</p>
        <p>Three important issues taken up in the preparatory negotiations remain unresolved.</p>
        <p>Although the conference adopted portions of Agenda 21, a plan for cleaning up the world's environment in the 21st century, disputes persist on how to pay for the cleanup, whether developing countries should have free access to new, environmentally sound technologies, and how to safeguard the world's forests. Discussion of these matters is expected to resume in Rio. Weather, Plants and Animals</p>
        <p>Also unresolved are two legally binding conventions -- one on stabilizing climate and the other on protecting the diversity of plant and animal life.</p>
        <p>The draft Rio Declaration on Environment and Development commits all nations to a number of principles that have not been universally accepted before. At its heart is an agreement that eradicating poverty is an "indispensable requirement for sustainable development."  [ Text, page 10. ]</p>
        <p>The other main points are that those who pollute should bear the cost of cleaning up, that nations should guard against environmental damage even where there are not established scientific reasons for precautions, that women have "a vital role in environmental management and development" and that while nations have a right to exploit their own resources, they have no right to "cause damage to the environment of other states or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction." Burden on the Rich</p>
        <p>In convoluted language, the richer northern countries acknowledge that the damage they have done in industrializing and the wealth they have acquired give them a special responsibility to help poorer lands raise living standards in environmentally safe ways.</p>
        <p>And the developing countries, which have environmental problems like overgrazing of land and the destruction of forests, pledge to curb soaring birthrates that contribute to poverty and to environmental degradation.</p>
        <p>The declaration, which was adopted early this morning, emerged from a bitter North-South political struggle that dominated the meeting.</p>
        <p>At first, the negotiators hoped to draft an Earth Charter, which the industrial nations expected to be a relatively short statement, committing countries in soaring, visionary language to safeguard the world's natural inheritance.</p>
        <p>But developing nations insisted on a more detailed, pragmatic document that would force the North to take responsibility for environmental problems and promise to help them continue their development safely. In addition to financial help, the developing countries are asking the richer ones to share new manufacturing techniques that will enable them to industrialize without polluting.</p>
        <p>At the last moment, Israel threatened to prevent unanimous approval of the declaration, arguing that a reference to safeguarding the natural resources of "people under oppression, domination and occupation" constituted "political pollution" of the text by the Palestine Liberation Organization and its Arab allies. 'Middle Ground'</p>
        <p>This argument was put aside, and the conference approved the compromise draft by acclamation.</p>
        <p>"The declaration captures the middle ground between the North's concern with cleaning up the environment and the South's concern with continuing its economic development," a Western diplomat said afterward.</p>
        <p>Developing countries appeared particularly pleased with the final text, seeing it as a victory for their view that any general statement of environmental principles must also address their economic needs.</p>
        <p>"Developing countries feared recolonization through environmental conditionalities because they are weaker than the North," said Tariq Osman Hyder of Pakistan, chief negotiator for the Group of 77, as the developing countries call themselves at the United Nations. "But this document achieves a middle point between northern and southern goals."</p>
        <p>The United States gave some ground during the talks. Previously, it did not acknowledge the need for new resources for developing countries to help pay for cleaning up the environment. But after criticism, Washington agreed to join others from the North in the view that the the nations of the South will need more help. No industrial nation has committed any specific amount of money.</p>
        <p>It is estimated that the poorer nations will require a total of $125 billion a year in foreign assistance to fully carry out Agenda 21 -- about $70 billion more than the $55 billion they now receive in aid from northern countries.</p>
        <p>Such an increase is generally dismissed as unrealistic in the present economic climate, in which many advanced countries are mired in recession. Some European diplomats say they expect the wealthy nations to pledge $3 billion to $6 billion in additional assistance at the Rio meeting. In addition, they think that current aid will increasingly be given for environmentally sound projects related to the goals of Agenda 21.</p>
        <p>North and South are also divided over how to give poor countries better access to environmentally sound technologies developed in the industrial world and how to protect the world's remaining forests.</p>
        <p>Malaysia, India and other lands with substantial forest acreage are reluctant to acknowledge any obligation to preserve forests in order to prevent changes in world climate, as the North wants.</p>
        <p>While neither today's draft declaration nor the full Agenda 21 is legally binding, a means for monitoring compliance is expected to be devised in Rio de Janeiro. This would put pressure on violators through public criticism, much like the way human rights standards have been enforced.</p>
        <p>Some nations favor creating a Sustainable Development Commission to follow up on the commitments that governments make in Rio de Janeiro, while others say this task should fall to the United Nations Economic and Social Council.</p>
        <p>The United States remains at loggerheads with the rest of the world in negotiations on a binding international convention on combating global warming.</p>
        <p>The Bush Administration continues to refuse to set specific detailed targets for curbing emissions that contribute to rises in temperature. Increasingly sharp criticism of Washington has come from the European Community, which insists on a treaty with specific emission limits.</p>
        <p>And President Bush has not said whether he will be among the more than 60 heads of state and government who have said they will attend the Rio conference.</p>
        <p>Jean Rippert of France, who is the chairman of the negotiating body for the convention, has scheduled a smaller meeting of key countries in Paris later this month to try to find a compromise before the next formal round of talks in May. Separate negotiations on the convention protecting the biological diversity of plants and animals are making greater progress.</p>
