        <p>LEAD:  Tree Adoptions: Make Mine Maple</p>
        <p>Tree Adoptions: Make Mine Maple</p>
        <p>With the start of the maple sugaring season just a few weeks away, researchers at the University of Vermont in Burlington have begun an ''Adopt-a-Maple Tree'' program to raise money to build a new laboratory dedicated to researching maple trees.</p>
        <p>The fund-raising effort comes in the wake of the destruction by fire of the 41-year-old Maple Research Center in Underhill, Vt., operated by the university and described by Dr. Hubert W. Vogelmann, a university botanist, as ''the only research facility of itskind in North America.'' Ten days ago a fire destroyed the lab building, along with $250,000 worth of equipment and years of research.</p>
        <p>The lab was established to study all aspects of maple trees, and to help maple sugar makers produce syrup more efficiently, said Dr. Vogelmann. Research has ranged from studying the effects of acid rain on maple trees to experiments in new ways of tapping trees to collect sap, Dr. Vogelmann said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Melvin T. Tyree, director of the lab, said he had lost all his data on a project concerning environmental stresses on maple trees, and said the fire set his work back one to two years. He was not alone: Frederick Laing, the former director of the center who is now a professor emeritus, lost nearly 20 years of data, Dr. Tyree said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Tyree said that state fire officials have told him that that the cause of the fire may never be known, but they speculated that a faulty wood stove might have been to blame. He said no damage was done to any of the maple trees on the 160-acre, former dairy farm upon which the lab was situated.</p>
        <p>And he said he has been pleased with the ''overwhelming show of support'' from farmers, sugar makers, and others in helping to raise money to rebuild the lab. The university's goal is to build a larger and more modern laboratory than the one that burned, which Dr. Tyree said would take at least $400,000 more than what was covered by insurance.</p>
        <p>The Adopt-a-Tree program is ''a real way to drum up grass-roots support,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Under the program, a person donating $25 will receive a certificate of adoption from the university and a map locating the adopted tree on the Underhill research farm. For $100, Dr. Tyree said, the university will engrave a donor's name on a plaque to be hung on the tree. For $500, he said, patrons names will appear on a plaque in the new laboratory.</p>
        <p>With 20,000 maple trees on the site, Dr. Tyree said that there were ''more than enough to go around'' for those interested in adoption.  Up in Arms Over Fonda</p>
        <p>There are veterans in Massachusetts who still hold a grudge against Jane Fonda for traveling to Hanoi in the Vietnam War 16 years ago. When some veterans in Holyoke learned that she would be in here next summer to film a movie, they sponsored a resolution to let her know of their displeasure. Last month, the Board of Alderman passed the measure in an 11-to-4 vote.</p>
        <p>''We can't stop her from coming here, but she's not welcome,'' said Alderman John E. Welihan, who is a veteran.</p>
        <p>Similar resolutions are scheduled to be taken up in two other Massachusetts towns, Chicopee and Beverley, March 7 and 9. Last fall, veterans in Waterbury, Conn., where much of the movie ''Union Street'' is to be filmed, ignited the current fuss with a bumper sticker campaign and letters to the editor of the local newspaper.</p>
        <p>One Holyoke veteran who supported the aldermanic resolution is Clayton K. Hough Jr. who lost both legs in Vietnam. He said it was not just Ms. Fonda's trip that angered veterans, but what she said and did while there.</p>
        <p>''She seemed to choose the other side: wearing their clothes, sitting behind anti-aircraft artillery,'' he said. Since then, ''We've heard other people atone for her but we've never heard her say she made a mistake.''</p>
        <p>But others in Holyoke defend Ms. Fonda's right to visit their city. Joseph M. McGiverin, president of the Board of Alderman who voted against the resoltuion said, ''We support the right of our veterans to protest and the right of Ms. Fonda to make a film here. We aren't going to throw out the red carpet but we aren't going to bar her either.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Fonda could not be reached for comment. But a spokesman for her, Stephen M. Rivers said, ''She thinks it was a mistake going to Hanoi and said that 10 years ago.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hough said ''Holyoke veterans would like to hear Ms. Fonda speak for herself in the national media and maybe set up a scholarship fund with the revenue from some of these movies for kids of guys who died over there.''  Technology To the Rescue</p>
        <p>The crack in the Liberty Bell is a celebrated flaw, but cracks and a gaping hole in the glass pavilion that houses the bell are a different matter.</p>
        <p>When a derelict threw a paving stone through one of the panels in the pavilion in December, officials of Independence National Historic Park in Philadelphia were left wondering how to replace the enormous piece of glass. The factory that manufactured the original panels, which measured 18 feet by 10 feet, informed park officials years ago that it could not reproduce additional ones because of the expense.</p>
        <p>''We were told the last time we replaced the glass, 'Don't come back anymore,' '' said Hobart G. Cawood, superintendent of the park. ''I was in a real dilemma.''</p>
        <p>Apprised of the problem, the DuPont Company proposed sandwiching Butacite, the same polymer substance that prevents automobile windshields from shattering, between two half-inch thick sheets of glass. The Ingersoll-Rand Corporation and the Dlubak Studios of Pittsburgh volunteered their equipment and expertise to cut and bond three pieces of glass to look as one.</p>
        <p>Installation of the new safety glass is scheduled to begin this week. The panel adjacent to the broken one also was to be replaced so that the tinted glass on the north side of the pavilion will be the same color.</p>
        <p>The panels, which cost $25,000 each, will be donated to the park by the three companies.</p>
        <p>As for the derelict, he initially told park officials that he broke the window after a park ranger poured out his wine. Faced with prosecution, he recanted and the charges were dropped.</p>
