        <p>Police in Louisiana raided Willie Nelson's tour bus and found one and a half pounds of marijuana. One and a half pounds. Wow! Sounds like Willie's slowing down.</p>
        <p>Big announcement from Ford Motor Company. Quality is still Job 1. However, Jobs 2 through 75,000 have been eliminated.</p>

        <p>A beautiful day here in New York City -- I want to tell you, this global warming is not so bad, is it? But seriously, have you noticed how much nicer the weather has been since we got rid of Pluto?</p>
        <p>Don't get me started on the traffic. It's because of the big opening of the U.N., the General Assembly, and you know who's here is the President of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is here. You know, he's the president who can actually pronounce ''nuclear.''</p>
        <p>I think maybe the pressure of being the president is getting to George Bush. He addresses the U.N. General Assembly, and he tells them in this very impassioned speech that he believes that Iraq has ''spinach of mass destruction.''</p>
