        <p>When Gov. Gray Davis of California signed legislation regulating automotive greenhouse gas emissions, the phone lines in his office lit up and the press office shut down.</p>
        <p>Angry and frustrated, a press officer, Steve Maviglio, responded by redirecting the calls to the newsroom of KFI-AM in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>The station's two afternoon talk show hosts, John Kobylt and Ken Chiampou, had been using their market-leading show to rail against the legislation, which they called the S.U.V. bill. They released the phone number of the governor's press office on the air.</p>
        <p>The incident was great for ratings, but Mr. Maviglio said it was potentially dangerous for California. Any calls relating to terrorism, for example, might not have gotten through, he said.</p>
        <p>From Howard Stern to Rush Limbaugh, talk radio hosts have long pulled stunts to make points or raise ratings. But Mr. Kobylt and Mr. Chiampou use their show to inject themselves into the news, often changing the very stories and issues they cover.</p>
        <p>''We've become a radio version of some combination of a political cartoon and theater,'' Mr. Kobylt said. ''And we have very loud ways of making a point.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kobylt and Mr. Chiampou first worked together in New Jersey more than a decade ago. In 1992, they moved to KFI, where they found fertile ground for guerrilla radio that mixed coverage of scandal and crime, like the O. J. Simpson and Menendez brothers cases, with genuine efforts for change.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, their producer, Ray Lopez, arranged a live interview with Mitchell Crooks, the man who filmed an Inglewood police officer punching a teenager in an arrest. After hearing of the interview, the district attorney's office phoned in to serve Mr. Crooks with a subpoena over his refusal to release his original videotape. After a few tense minutes, an agitated Mr. Crooks hung up the phone.</p>
        <p>''Fireworks ensued,'' Mr. Lopez said, ''and it was the lead story on the 11 o'clock news.'' Hours later, Mr. Crooks's screaming arrest made every cable news network.</p>
        <p>When two teenage girls were kidnapped in Lancaster on Thursday, Juanita Ratliff, the wife of the kidnapper, Ray Ratliff, called after he had been shot and killed after the girls were freed. Mr. Lopez said, ''She was upset about the way her late husband was being chastised on the air.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lopez said that Mrs. Ratliff refused to appear live on the air but told him that her husband had been on the run for over a year. She said she had phoned the police before Mr. Ratliff's discovery, and informed the police that she had a hunch her husband was involved. ''She told us that he had made some mistakes, and had to pay the price,'' Mr. Lopez said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lopez played a recorded part of the conversation on the air.</p>
        <p>With the primary looming this spring, the hosts learned of child pornography charges against Judge Ronald C. Kline of Orange County Superior Court, who ran unopposed in his re-election race. A hacker sent KFI a diary from the judge's computer. After reading parts of the diary on the air and leading a campaign against Judge Kline, Mr. Kobylt and Mr. Chiampou claimed responsibility for nearly a quarter of a million write-in votes against the judge, who then withdrew from the race.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kobylt and Mr. Chiampou said they follow no particular political agenda, but in the case of the greenhouse gas emissions bill, V. John White, a Sierra Club lawyer, and Fran Pavley, a state assemblywoman and the bill's author, are not so sure.</p>
        <p>The hosts seized on a list of options for reducing greenhouse gases that the California Air Resources Board had published in initial research on the bill. Options in the report included a 2-cent-per-mile fee on minivans and sport utility vehicles, a $3,500 surcharge on larger vehicles or a 50-cent-per-gallon increase in the gasoline tax.</p>
        <p>Ms. Pavley said these suggestions were never intended to be a part of the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. White agreed. ''They created a boogeyman that never had anything to do with the bill,'' he said. ''It was a very deliberate strategy of distortion.''</p>
        <p>At a KFI-led protest of the bill at the State Capitol on July 12, Mr. Kobylt accosted Mr. White over $3,500 fees, gas taxes and his weight. Mr. White responded with accusations of lies. ''I've never seen a talk show host act with such aggression,'' Mr. White said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kobylt and Mr. Chiampou have promised to fight for a voter-led referendum against the new law in November.</p>
        <p>''It's the stuff you yell at the TV screen in bed when you're watching at home,'' Mr. Kobylt said. ''That's what we do. It's the first impulse. Raw, unedited and unfiltered.''</p>
