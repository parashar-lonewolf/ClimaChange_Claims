        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Critics Rise Up Against Environmental Education'' (news article, April 22) kissed off the findings of the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Project with a derogatory comment by Michael Oppenheimer of the Environmental Defense Fund.</p>
        <p>The conclusions of this $500 million study inspired by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan were ignored by most of the news media when they were released in 1990 because they ran counter to the claims by environmentalists that acid rain was destroying forests, lakes and streams in the Northeast.</p>
        <p>The result was that Congress, which commissioned the 10-year study, included in the Clean Air Act of 1990 needless requirements to combat acid rain that were estimated to cost electric power consumers about $5 billion a year.</p>
        <p>The reaction of the environmentalists and their ''green'' allies in the news media was expressed at the time by David Hawkins of the Natural Resources Defense Council.</p>
        <p>In an interview aired by ''60 Minutes'' on Dec. 30, 1990, Mr. Hawkins said that the Natural Resources Defense Council paid little attention to the massive acid precipitation assessment report because it was easier to deal ''with the facts we already have on hand'' about the damage supposedly caused by acid rain.</p>
        <p>Organizations like the Natural Resources Defense Council have profited immensely from promoting scares like the Alar-apple hoax of 1989 and the acid-rain panic.</p>
        <p>The efforts by two of the critics you mention, Dr. Michael Sanera and the George C. Marshall Institute, to get educators to teach facts, not fears, are to be commended.</p>
        <p>REED IRVINE  Chairman  Accuracy in Media  Washington, May 2, 1997</p>
