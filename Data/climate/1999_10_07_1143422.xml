        <p>Over the last two decades, countries in northern Europe and North America have been enacting regulations to reduce smokestack emissions of sulfur in an effort to curb acid rain and its harmful effect on the environment. Today, in what researchers say is the first comprehensive look at the effect of those reductions on rivers and lakes, an international team of scientists is reporting a nearly universal decrease on both continents in the levels of sulfates, the major acidifying pollutant deposited by acid rain in surface water.</p>
        <p>Despite the reductions in sulfates,  researchers did not see a decrease in overall acidity, the sign of true recovery, in all regions. In Europe and in one region of North America that includes Quebec and Vermont, researchers did see the expected trend toward decreasing levels of acidity. In four regions in North America from Maine to the Midwest, however, scientists did not see such a trend.</p>
        <p>The message for policy makers, scientists said, is that the path to recovery from acid rain is not going to be as simple or as quick as scientists had thought.</p>
        <p>''The good news is that we reduced sulfate deposition and acid rain,'' said Dr. Gary Lovett, an ecosystem ecologist at the Institute of Ecosystem Studies, praising the quality of the study, which is being published today in the journal Nature.</p>
        <p>''It's sobering news that this hasn't given us the recovery that we might have hoped for,'' Dr. Lovett said. ''It's going to promote rethinking of our acid rain policies.''</p>
        <p>Dr. David Schindler, a freshwater ecologist at the University of Alberta, called the list of authors of the study a ''who's who in acid rain research.'' He said the research ''clearly indicates that if we want sufficient recovery from a wide variety of lakes to support fisheries, we're going to have to take another pretty large cut'' out of sulfur dioxides, the sulfur emissions caused by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas that produce acidifying sulfates.</p>
        <p>But other researchers said it was still unclear whether recovery would  require further reductions in emissions or simply more time, or both. The researchers who were interviewed agreed, however, that any further decreases in emissions would speed eventual recovery.</p>
        <p>Paul Bailey, vice president of environment at the Edison Electric Institute, which represents electric utilities -- a major producer of sulfur emissions -- viewed the results more optimistically and noted that the Clean Air Act required further reductions in emissions beginning next year. ''The theme appears to be that things are getting better,'' Mr. Bailey said, ''and things are going to continue to get better.''</p>
        <p>Previously, researchers studying the effect of acid rain on lakes and rivers confined their studies to more limited geographic areas, coming up with what were often conflicting and confusing results as to how surface waters responded in general.</p>
        <p>In what researchers say is the broadest geographic study to date, 23 scientists compared data from about 200 sites across northern Europe and North America. The data were gathered by the International Cooperative Program on Assessment and Monitoring of Acidification of Rivers and Lakes, a system of regular monitoring by national agencies.</p>
        <p>''There were a lot of little dots,'' said Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, chief scientist for the Environmental Defense Fund. ''They've connected them all up.''</p>
        <p>In the new study, researchers reported that the reason many regions in North America were not recovering despite declines in sulfates was that important compounds like those of calcium and magnesium, which counteract the acidifying effects of sulfates, were also declining. Any gains to lakes in sulfate declines, the researchers said, were overwhelmed by an accompanying rapid decline in these neutralizing substances, base cations, leading to an overall lack of change in acidity in these lakes and rivers.</p>
        <p>Scientists say it still not known  why base cations are in short supply and how quickly they will be replenished. But researchers suspect that the decline in base cations is a direct result of years of acid rain leaching these compounds out of the soil at a faster rate than they are replaced.</p>
        <p>A major source of base cations is the breakdown of rocks in soil. The researchers note that three of the regions in North America where recovery was expected but not seen and where there were large decreases in base cations -- south-central Ontario, midwestern North America and the Adirondack and Catskill Mountains in upstate New York -- are close to significant sources of sulfur emissions and acid rains, which could have exacerbated the losses of these crucial compounds over the years. Researchers also say climate and changes in human emissions may affect levels of base cations.</p>
        <p>''It's not as simple as turn something off, get something else to happen,'' said Dr. Steve Kahl, director of the Water Research Institute at the University of Maine and an author on the report. ''This is an overwhelming conclusion. We can't just make a policy implementation and walk away and assume that we've fixed the problem.''</p>
        <p>Scientists say little is known about what, if any, biological recovery has occurred. Testing water chemistry, they note, is much simpler and faster than accounting for changes in the presence or number of many different kinds of animals and plants. But the scientists who were interviewed agreed that biological recovery would be much longer in coming.</p>
        <p>Dr. Schindler said that in experimentally acidified lakes -- in which plants and fish, crustaceans and other animals disappeared -- some species returned within days when the lakes were later allowed to recover, while others still have not returned after more than a decade.</p>
        <p>''We've been creating acid rain for a long time,'' Dr. Lovett said. ''It may take a long time to recover from its effects.''</p>
