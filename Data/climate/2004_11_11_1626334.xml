        <p>The French government forged ahead on Wednesday with a plan to sell a one-third stake in the nuclear power group Areva on the Paris stock exchange early next year -- a transaction that could raise more than 3.5 billion euros ($4.51 billion).</p>
        <p>The sale, expected in the first half of 2005, would increase the portion of Areva's shares that are publicly traded to 35 to 40 percent, France's finance minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, said in a statement.</p>
        <p>The partial privatization of Areva, the world's largest maker of nuclear reactors, comes as the government-owned company is trying to raise its international profile.</p>
        <p>The company is competing for an $8 billion contract from China to build four nuclear reactors. Last month it began a $250 million project for the United States government to convert weapons-grade plutonium into mixed-oxide fuel rods for civilian use.</p>
        <p>Areva has a market value of more than 10 billion euros ($12.9 billion), based on a closing price Wednesday of 288.80 euros for nonvoting investment certificates.</p>
        <p>The company had a net profit of 243 million euros ($313 million) in the first half of this year.</p>
        <p>Last week the company said, without giving its earnings, that its group revenue for the fiscal year to Sept. 30 rose by 31.6 percent, to 7.7 billion euros.</p>
        <p>''We are ready,'' Areva's chief executive, Anne Lauvergeon, said of the share sale. ''This increase in our float capital will provide us with the resources we need to continue expanding.''</p>
        <p>The government said the proceeds of the share offering would be used to help cover the costs of dismantling 15 nuclear sites run by the Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique, the nuclear power agency that holds the bulk of the government's stake in the company.</p>
        <p>Denis Guelen, an analyst at the French brokerage Fideuram Wargny, said that growth prospects for the nuclear power sector remained moderate, especially in Europe, where political opposition to nuclear power is still strong. But soaring economic growth in Asia and increasing awareness of the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, along with the desire to renovate and upgrade existing nuclear sites in North America and Russia, will combine to guarantee ''solid fundamentals'' for the industry in the decades to come, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sarkozy announced the Areva share sale just weeks before his planned resignation at the end of this month. France's most popular politician, Mr. Sarkozy is running for head of the governing Conservative Party before an expected bid for the French presidency in 2007.</p>
        <p>In his final months in office, Mr. Sarkozy has sought to accelerate the privatization of a number of government-run companies, seeking cash to reduce a government deficit that is expected to reach 50 billion euros this year, about 3.6 percent of gross domestic product.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, the government-owned Société d'Autoroutes Paris-Rhin-Rhône, Europe's third-biggest toll-road operator, began selling up to 1.35 billion euros in shares; in September, the state sold 5.1 billion euros worth of shares in France Télécom, bringing its stake in the phone company below 50 percent for the first time. In June, Mr. Sarkozy oversaw the sale of a 35 percent stake in the aircraft engine maker Snecma, raising 1.15 billion euros.</p>
        <p>In addition to Areva, other government-owned groups slated for partial privatization next year include the utility group Électricité de France and Aéroports de Paris, the operator of the capital's two main airports, Roissy-Charles de Gaulle and Orly.</p>
        <p>Correction:  November 13, 2004, Saturday  An article in World Business on Thursday about a French government plan to sell a one-third stake in the nuclear power group Areva misstated the period for the company's 7.7 billion euros in revenue ($9.9 billion). It was the first nine months of this year, not the 12 months ended in September. Because of an editing error, the article also misstated the political affiliation of the finance minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, who announced the sale. It is the Union for a Popular Movement, a conservative party. (There is no French Conservative Party.)</p>
