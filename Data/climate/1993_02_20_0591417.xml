        <p>Two weeks ago tonight, on the coldest evening of the year, the full moon stayed above the horizon nearly till dawn. Its light bounced so brightly off the snow that you could read the plunging thermometer without a flashlight: 25 below, 28 below, 30 below. In the days since, as the moon has grown smaller, the Adirondack sky has brimmed with stars, safe from the competition with lunar glow.</p>
        <p>This cycle is older than life on Earth. But earlier this month, Russian scientists, using a thin aluminum and plastic mirror, managed to send a narrow beam of reflected sunlight back to the dark side of Earth.</p>
        <p>The achievement was hailed by many as a great advance. Scaled up in size, proponents said, such a mirror could turn night into twilight at darker latitudes, thereby saving billions of dollars on electric lighting as well as extending planting and harvesting seasons.</p>
        <p>It would also, I think, constitute the single most offensive form of pollution yet devised by man and illuminate our failings as a species far more brightly than it would light the Arctic tundra. Scientists tell us we may be artificially heating the globe: Do we really want to turn night into day as well? Do we really want to erode some of the darkness that remains on this incandescent planet, to bleach the evening and make midnight pale?</p>
        <p>Who should be screaming about this? Environmentalists, perhaps, for what more basic assault can be mounted on our environment than changing its cadence? What about those who cherish animals and plants, since many species regulate their lives by the length of day and night?</p>
        <p>And what about poets? Or has poetry reached some post-modern emptiness where an ode to floating Russian tinfoil is as engaging as the dialogue of millenniums with Luna?</p>
        <p>And what about lovers: how will a sunset look in perpetual twilight?</p>
        <p>You'd expect religious leaders to be upset, for in the first passage of Genesis God creates light and divides it from the dark.</p>
        <p>But everything in the modern world trains us to discount our roles as romantics, children of God, lovers of nature. If an engineer or a corporation insists that it's more efficient, if it will "save money," if it seems somehow to constitute "progress," then it happens -- even a scheme that seems as bizarre and untenable as this one could, barring opposition, achieve unstoppable momentum in a matter of decades.</p>
        <p>It is nearly impossible to find a commercial technology that, once developed, has not been put into use. There's no real need for longer days -- surely we can think of easier ways of saving electricity. But history would indicate that where there's a way there's a will.</p>
        <p>Few people have questioned if there might be something alarming about altering this most ancient of rhythms. A Russian committee already claims to have studied and dismissed the chance of global warming.</p>
        <p>The prevailing sentiment was expressed by a Canadian astronomer, who saw the flashing light tumbling through space and close beside it the lights of the Progress and Mir spacecraft. "You could see all three in the sky at once and it was spectacular," he said.</p>
        <p>But people have been looking into the sky since there were people. (That may be as good a definition as any of the moment when we became human.) And all that we have seen there -- nets and dippers, crabs and bears, comets and auroras, moon fire and deep blackness -- all these are more spectacular by far.</p>
