        <p>The melting of mountain glaciers around the world continues to accelerate, the World Glacier Monitoring Service reported. According to the United Nations Environment Program, a partner with the service, surveys of 80 glaciers in mountain ranges around the world show they lost, on average, about two feet of ice thickness in 2005. Comprehensive data from 2006 were not yet available, the United Nations said, but since that year was one of the warmest on record, the accelerated shrinking is believed to be continuing. Since 1980, 30 reference glaciers in nine mountain ranges have lost, on average, the equivalent of more than 30 feet of ice thickness, the United Nations said. In a statement, Achim Steiner, executive director of the environment program, said the ice loss resulted from human-induced global warming.</p>
