        <p>LEAD: President Reagan's lame-duck appointment of four overseas ambassadors left foreign policy analysts, and at least one appointee himself, wondering today if the new diplomats would have to pack their bags again after just eight weeks.</p>
        <p>President Reagan's lame-duck appointment of four overseas ambassadors left foreign policy analysts, and at least one appointee himself, wondering today if the new diplomats would have to pack their bags again after just eight weeks.</p>
        <p>In appointing new ambassadors to Israel, Denmark, India and Oman, in addition to 28 other people to assorted Federal agencies and commissions, Mr. Reagan was exercising his constitutional powers to make appointments while Congress is in recess.</p>
        <p>Some of the appointees had faced opposition in the Senate, which could have rejected them if it was in session. If President-elect Bush does not replace them, their terms in general would last until the end of the next session of Congress, about a year from now. Two of the ambassadorial appointees have close political ties to the Republican Party and two are career diplomats. 'Compelling Reasons' Cited</p>
        <p>Robert H. Tuttle, the White House personnel director, explained that Mr. Reagan made the appointments, announced Tuesday, to assure continuity in overseas postings and because several Federal panels could not function without quorums.</p>
        <p>''We felt there were compelling reasons in each case,'' said Mr. Tuttle. The appointees, he added, were aware that Mr. Bush could replace them when he takes office Jan. 20. ''This isn't something we did haphazardly.''</p>
        <p>Several foreign policy analysts at the State Department, in Congress and elsewhere today said that they were bewildered that Mr. Reagan selected new ambassadors at this time because of relocation expenses and the political disruption of pulling ambassadors out after brief service if Mr. Bush decides to replace them.</p>
        <p>''With a lot of these people it's just moving them into a desk with a nice view they can enjoy for a while,'' said a high-ranking State Department official who asked not to be named. ''But with Ambassadors, it's much more involved. I just don't know how they're going to manage.'' 'Is It a Toy?'</p>
        <p>Perry Shankle, president of the American Foreign Service Association, a union and professional group here for 9,000 Foreign Service officers, said he was concerned about the expense involved at a time when the Government is reducing the size of its embassy staffs.</p>
        <p>''Is an embassy a serious thing or is it a toy?'' he asked. ''I have a real problem with this. It could be seen in a country that all it's being used for is to pay some political debt.''</p>
        <p>It had been standard procedure for an ambassador to stay in place until a successor is named. Except for India, where the ambassador departed several weeks ago, the other three embassies are still occupied by the outgoing ambassadors, according to State Department officials.</p>
        <p>Keith L. Brown, a Denver real estate developer and Republican fund raiser who was selected as Ambassador to Denmark, said in a telephone interview today that he had not been given any assurances by Bush aides that he would remain.</p>
        <p>''I personally feel I will be allowed to stay on,'' he said, ''or I would not have accepted the recess appointment. It would be very foolish. But I have not had any assurance of any kind.'' A Frequent Reagan Tactic</p>
        <p>Mr. Reagan has used the recess appointment process more than any other President in recent memory. He made 139 such appointments in his first term alone, and more are still likely before he leaves office. President Carter made 59 in four years; President Ford made 8 in two and a half years and President Nixon made 41 in five and a half years.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Reagan's appointments this week are particularly unusual because he is being followed into office by his own Vice President. It is the first time this has happened since Martin Van Buren was elected President in 1836.</p>
        <p>Sheila Tate, a spokeswoman for Mr. Bush, said that the White House had notified Mr. Bush of the recess apppointments, but that the Vice President ''neither opposed nor endorsed them.'' She added: ''The presumption of all political appointees is that they have no guaranteed jobs. The Vice President has said it is his intent to bring in many new faces.''</p>
        <p>Besides Mr. Brown, Mr. Reagan named another longtime supporter as an ambassador: John R. Hubbard, a former president of the University of Southern California, who will serve in India.</p>
        <p>Two career officers were appointed, William Andreas Brown as Ambassador to Israel and Richard W. Boehm as Ambassador to Oman. In another appointment that holds the rank of ambassador, Sonia Landau, former chairwoman of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, was named coordinator for international communications and information policy.</p>
        <p>The appointees have the same authority as if they had been confirmed by the Senate.</p>
        <p>The appointments had been forwarded to Congress but many came in the final days of the session. Senator Claiborne Pell, a Rhode Island Democratic who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, had put off hearings on some of the diplomatic nominees, preferring that Mr. Bush fill the positions.</p>
        <p>But Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said all the appointments ''represented an urgency of one kind or another,'' particularly the ambassadorships.</p>
        <p>''India is the most obvious example,'' he said, ''where you have a changing government in neighboring Pakistan and the Soviet troop withdrawal in Afghanistan going on.''</p>
        <p>Among the recess appointees were John R. Berg, assistant secretary for conservation and renewable energy, Department of Energy; Becky Norton Dunlop, assistant secretary for fish and wildlife at the Interior Department; Robert H. Gentile, director of the office of surface mining reclamation and enforcement; Margot E. Machol, member of the Federal Trade Commission, and David Courtland O'Neal, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tuttle said two people turned down appointments, but for ''personal reasons'' and not because of concerns about serving short terms.</p>
        <p>''Maybe the President did it so people could say, 'I was the commissioner of the F.T.C. for three months' on their resume,'' said Alan B. Morrison, director of the Public Citizen Litigation Group, a nonprofit organization.</p>
