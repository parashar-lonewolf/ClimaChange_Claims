        <p>When Congress passed the Clean Air Act of 1990, it created something never before seen in the annals of capitalism: a free market in pollution.</p>
        <p>If a company could clean up its emissions more than required under the new law, it could sell the right to pollute to another company. The freedom to trade pollution rights like pork bellies, and even make a profit, would give companies an incentive to upgrade dirty plants, the thinking went.</p>
        <p>But an announcement this week that the Long Island Lighting Company was selling an option on some of its pollution rights to another company has raised fears in New York's environmental community that the Clean Air Act will not help improve air quality in New York State.  Raising Concerns</p>
        <p>Much of Lilco's pollution drifted out to sea, but if the company that bought the rights to pollute is in, say, Ohio, the acid rain it produces could well end up over the Adirondacks, an area that the act was specifically intended to protect.</p>
        <p>The problem, environmentalists and state officials say, is that the law does not regulate the pollution rights sales or require companies to provide any public information about them, at least until 1995. As a consequence, pollution could be shifted from one region to another without officials realizing it.</p>
        <p>The Lilco transaction -- among the first in the budding pollution market and the first by a New York State utility -- exemplifies such concerns because the company has declined to say who has purchased the option, other than to describe it as a "non-utility energy supplier."</p>
        <p>A Lilco spokeswoman, Suzanne Halpin, said releasing the information could damage the company's ability to negotiate future sales. She said the pollution rights had not yet been transferred because the buyer acquired an option for the rights that could be exercised in the future.</p>
        <p>At the heart of New York's fears is the belief that the biggest purchasers of pollution credits will be the Midwestern coal-burning utility plants that are among the chief sources of acid rain in the East. If that were the case, there might be little or no net improvement in the acidity of the Adirondacks' numerous lakes, they say. A New Market</p>
        <p>"The trading program didn't take into consideration where the pollution would fall after it was traded," said John F. Sheehan, a spokesman for the Adirondack Council, an environmental group. "We have Lilco, whose pollution will go out to sea, trading to the Midwest, where the pollution will fall on us."</p>
        <p>Because there have been few sales nationwide and little information about them, it is impossible to determine who is buying pollution credits.</p>
        <p>To some degree, the newness of the market has discouraged sales, since many utility managers do not want to invest in commodities of uncertain value.</p>
        <p>But some experts expect trading to increase after the Federal Government sells at auction a stock of pollution credits in March. By raising concerns now, New York's environmental community is seeking to pressure state and Federal agencies to find ways of regulating, or at least monitoring, the trades before the market heats up.</p>
        <p>"It's not that trading can't work, but it must also work to achieve the benefits of the law, which is acid rain abatement," said Thomas C. Jorling, the State Commissioner for Environmental Conservation. View From Washington</p>
        <p>At the request of Mr. Jorling and environmental groups, the State Public Service Commission, which oversees utilities, has begun investigating whether it can regulate pollution trades. The Assembly Environmental Committee is also considering legislation to prevent New York State utilities from selling pollution credits to plants upwind of the Adirondacks.</p>
        <p>Federal environmental officials say New York State's concerns are unfounded for several reasons.</p>
        <p>First, about half of all the sulfur dioxide produced in the nation comes from 10 states in the Midwest -- 10 percent from Ohio alone. Because the Clean Air Act mandates that the entire nation cut its output of sulfur dioxide in half by 2010, E.P.A. officials believe that most of the cuts must come from the Midwest. Prevailing westerly winds blow the Midwest's pollution into the East.</p>
        <p>"The rest of the nation couldn't produce enough credits to sell to the Midwest to let it keep polluting at the same level," said Brian J. McLean, director of the E.P.A.'s Acid Rain Division.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. also believes that Midwestern utility plants are likelier to sell than to buy pollution credits. Those older, coal-burning plants are so dirty that even installing the simplest, least expensive pollution control devices will substantially reduce their emissions, Mr. McLean said. Hence, they will have additional credits to trade. Higly Acidic Lakes</p>
        <p>"If you're going to put technology on, you're going to do it in the Midwest," he said. "That's where you get the biggest bang per buck."</p>
        <p>But whether those reductions will be enough to help scores of Adirondack lakes rendered virtually lifeless by high acidity remains in doubt. About a quarter of the region's 2,800 lakes and ponds are highly acidic, most because of acid rain, according to E.P.A. studies.</p>
        <p>"We expect at least a substantial reduction of acid rain in the Adirondacks," Mr. McLean said.</p>
        <p>What makes pollution trading difficult to predict is the newness of the market. Some analysts have estimated that pollution credits -- one credit equals one ton of sulfur dioxide -- are selling for between $250 and $400 each, which is considered low.</p>
        <p>If prices remained at that level, utilities might be encouraged to buy credits rather than to install pollution control devices, or scrubbers, experts have said.</p>
        <p>But low prices might enable environmental groups to buy up credits and then "bury them," said Tim Burke, executive director of the Adirondack Council. "That might drive prices up, but that might also encourage companies to buy scrubbers."</p>
        <p>In general, the notion of trading emission allowances has been praised by both environmental groups and utilities as an innovative solution to a costly problem.</p>
        <p>In the past, the Federal Government simply set pollution levels for utility plants and then fined them if they did not meet those standards. By 2000, the Clean Air Act will have also set emission standards for most utility plants in the country.</p>
        <p>But it will also give them alternatives for meeting those limits: they can either invest in new equipment or buy pollution credits, whichever is cheaper. And if they fall below the level set for them, they can make a profit and reduce customers' rates.</p>
        <p>Starting in 1995, those companies that fail to meet their limits -- either by upgrading plants or by buying pollution credits -- will be fined $2,000 for every ton of excess sulfur dioxide.</p>
        <p>E.P.A. officials said one of the reasons that Congress approved the stringent sulfur dioxide standards in the Clean Air Act was that it liked the idea that utilities companies could treat pollution like a commodity. Consequently, there might be little political support for regulating pollution trading, they said.</p>
        <p>"It is important to understand there is a real balancing point to this," said Renee Rico, chief of the Market Innovations Branch of the E.P.A.'s Acid Rain Division. "We got a larger reduction in return for flexibility."</p>
