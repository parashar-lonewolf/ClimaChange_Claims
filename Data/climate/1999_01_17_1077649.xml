        <p>EARTH ODYSSEY  Around the World in Search of  Our Environmental Future.  By Mark Hertsgaard.  372 pp. New York:  Broadway Books. $26.</p>
        <p>Mark Hertsgaard'S reputation as an astute journalist was made in the 1980's when as a magazine and book writer he explored politics, the press and pop culture. His best-known work, ''On Bended Knee: The Press and the Reagan Presidency'' (1988), described the way the Reagan White House deployed raw power and conventional wisdom to intimidate Washington's television newsrooms. In the 1990's, his attention turned to the even more formidable: the ecological fate of the earth. Hertsgaard embarked upon a seven-year global tour to investigate the environmental future. The journey spanned four continents, 19 countries and hundreds of interviews. Hertsgaard spoke with Vaclav Havel in Prague, he talked with industrial workers in soot-choked China and retraced Winston Churchill's steps in North Africa.</p>
        <p>Hertsgaard's central question in 1991 was ''whether the human species would survive the next hundred years.'' By the time he returned in the late 1990's to write in a cabin amid a majestic grove of California sequoias, he was convinced the answer was yes. But he finds few other reasons to be optimistic: The pace of global population growth, rampant air and water pollution in the developing world and the weakening resolve of the United States to lead the environmental revolution it fostered spell big trouble for the quality of human existence.</p>
        <p>This, of course, is hardly a novel message. But Hertsgaard is after something different from the annual compendium of trends in the planet's failing health put out by Lester R. Brown's Worldwatch Institute, or the eloquent assessment, in Bill McKibben's ''End of Nature,'' of the risks to the environment and the economy posed by global climate change. Hertsgaard's focus is the human dimension to global ecological decline, and in ''Earth Odyssey,'' he displays an authentic talent for storytelling. By taking care to explain the technical, by including just enough of himself and by giving full breath to select characters, he has transformed a daunting subject into a stirring contribution to the growing literature on the global environment.</p>
        <p>The path Hertsgaard takes around the world is full of surprises and unexplored places. Just as important, he does not berate or moralize. His tone is generally that of an interested and accomplished reporter seeking to understand communities and assemble a foundation of facts from which to draw conclusions.</p>
        <p>The chapters on China are especially satisfying. In Chongqing, a southwestern industrial city, Hertsgaard investigates a chlorine plant that officials say is closed, but continues to operate and pour a toxic waterfall of raw chlorine and other chemicals directly into the Jialing River, a drinking water source for millions of people. But this was hardly the worst pollution he saw there.</p>
        <p>Though residents of China's cities rarely see blue sky because of air pollution caused by burning coal, and rivers are so choked by raw sewage and chemical wastes that fish cannot survive, China's 1.2 billion people are still motivated by one concern. They want to make enough money to escape poverty, joblessness and cramped living conditions that Americans would never tolerate. Western environmental concerns seem so inconsequential as to be almost laughable. ''You may complain about our contributions to global warming or the ozone hole,'' Hertsgaard is told. ''But how much pollution we make, how many trees we cut or dams we build is nobody's business but ours.''</p>
        <p>''Social forces have been set in motion that will not be contained,'' Hertsgaard writes. ''Electricity, telephones, running water -- once humans experience these things, they want more of them, no matter the ecological cost. As well they might. It is easy for outsiders to warn against the long-term costs of damming Africa's rivers, ruining its scenery, or destroying its woodlands, but it is akin to a glutton admonishing a beggar on the evil of carbohydrates -- he lacks a certain moral authority.''</p>
        <p>Where ''Earth Odyssey'' falters is its recommendations. Hertsgaard's survey of the potential fixes for a world being disfigured by the passion for wealth -- technology improvements, more efficiently using resources, minimizing waste, even shifting taxes to penalize pollution -- is so bogged down in statistics and theory that it's like breathing through a dishrag. Hertsgaard could have remedied this problem by focusing more intensely on the solution he knows the most about: politics and government.</p>
        <p>It's been little more than a generation since the United States invented and enacted the program that cleaned the air, cleared the water and safeguarded millions of acres of wild lands. Presidents of both parties and bipartisan Congressional action provided the political foundation for visionary people to do something great.</p>
        <p>In the 1960's, for example, Stewart L. Udall, the Secretary of the Interior during eight years of the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, established four national parks, six national monuments, nine national recreation areas, 20 national historic sites and nine national lakeshores and seashores. Udall also wrote the 1964 Wilderness Act, which preserved tens of millions of acres of wild land, and helped to gain passage of the 1968 Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. He championed Rachel Carson's warning about toxic chemicals and set the stage for the pioneering environmental legislation of the 1970's.</p>
        <p>The question Hertsgaard needed to address is why Washington turned meek. It's not enough to spend pages criticizing Vice President Al Gore for failing to act on a vow to make the environment the ''central organizing principle'' of governance -- the conclusion of Gore's best-selling book ''The Earth in the Balance'' (1992). Gore works in an economic and historic context that has shrunk the political comfort zone for courageous policy making. Business owners, lawmakers, the press and ultimately voters are apparently satisfied with mediocre governing. Until the political market for inspired ideas and passionate leadership reawakens in the United States, what Hertsgaard calls ''the material striving of the entire human family'' will never be reconciled with the carrying capacity of the planet's environment.</p>
