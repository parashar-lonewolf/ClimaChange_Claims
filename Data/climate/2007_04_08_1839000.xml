        <p>BROOKLAND, by Emily Barton. (Picador, $15.) Set in late-18th-century Brooklyn, Barton's second novel is a beautiful tale of women, gin-making and bridge-building. As a small child, Barton's heroine, Prudence Winship, looks across the East River from the village of Brooklyn (or Brookland) at Manhattan. Years later Prudence and her sisters -- high-spirited Temperance and silent, eerie Pearl -- operate a gin distillery inherited from their father and dream of building a single-span bridge to connect Brooklyn with Manhattan (well before the actual Brooklyn Bridge was completed in 1883). Our reviewer, Christopher Corbett, called ''Brookland'' a story ''not just of risk, daring and ambition but of the courage to fail -- and the courage to live on after failing.''</p>
        <p>AMERICAN GOSPEL: God, the Founding Fathers, and the Making of a Nation, by Jon Meacham. (Random House, $15.95.) Meacham, the editor of Newsweek, explores the founders' understanding of the complex relationship between religion and the civil state, and offers a balanced account of successive periods in America's religious history. A PERFECT UNION: Dolley Madison and the Creation of the American Nation, by Catherine Allgor. (Owl/Holt, $16.) This is an evocative study of how Dolley Madison -- as the wife of Thomas Jefferson's Secretary of State James Madison and, later, as first lady -- became the architect of Washington's social scene, using her charm to political advantage.</p>
        <p>AVERNO, by Louise GlÃ1/4ck. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $12.) A National Book Award finalist last year, GlÃ1/4ck's 10th collection of poems rewrites the legend of Persephone, casting her as a forlorn soul caught in ''an argument between the mother and the lover,'' between Hades, god of death, and Demeter, goddess of earth. In the Book Review Nicholas Christopher called these 18 linked poems ''rich and resonant,'' and said GlÃ1/4ck, a Pulitzer Prize winner and former United States poet laureate, explores ''concepts like 'mind' and 'soul' with a fresh, often acidulous, perspective.''</p>
        <p>THE WEATHER MAKERS: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth, by Tim Flannery. (Grove, $15.) Flannery has written ecological histories of North America (''The Eternal Frontier'') and his native Australia (''The Future Eaters''); in ''The Weather Makers'' he surveys the history of Earth's shifting climate and adds well-drawn portraits of a biological world already showing signs of global warming. ''If humans pursue a business-as-usual course for the first half of this century,'' he warns, ''I believe the collapse of civilization due to climate change becomes inevitable.''</p>
        <p>THE ACCIDENTAL EMPIRE: Israel and the Birth of the Settlements, 1967-1977, by Gershom Gorenberg. (Times/Holt, $17.) Gorenberg, an American-born Israeli journalist, portrays the decade after the 1967 war as a melancholy story of inadvertent colonialism. After an unexpected victory in a war it didn't seek, Israel, he argues, dithered while a decisive few began staking wildcat claims throughout the captured land.</p>
        <p>THROUGH A GLASS, DARKLY, by Donna Leon. (Penguin/Grove, $7.99.) In Leon's 15th procedural mystery, Commissario Guido Brunetti heads to the Venetian island of Murano to investigate death threats the irascible owner of a glass factory has been making against his son-in-law. The commissario is forced to take a more sober view of this picturesque community of artisans when a factory worker is found toasted to death in front of one of the giant furnaces.</p>
        <p>PROGRAMMING THE UNIVERSE: A Quantum Computer Scientist Takes on the Cosmos, by Seth Lloyd. (Vintage, $14.95.) Lloyd, a professor of mechanical engineering at M.I.T., seeks to explain the fundamental workings of the universe by equating it with a new device called a quantum computer. In the space of 221 pages, he tackles computer logic, thermodynamics, chaos theory, quantum mechanics, cosmology, consciousness, sex and the origins of life.</p>
        <p>COVERING: The Hidden Assault on Our Civil Rights, by Kenji Yoshino. (Random House, $15.95.) This provocative treatise combines an examination of the current state of civil rights with an account of the author's experiences as a gay Japanese-American. Yoshino, a law professor at Yale, describes a phenomenon he calls ''covering'': the pressure exerted on racial and ethnic minorities, gays and others to mute certain characteristics in order to fit into the mainstream. He traces the history of civil rights legislation in the United States, and concludes that too often the courts have ignored the threat posed by the ''dark side of assimilation.''</p>
        <p>RATTLED, by Debra Galant. (St. Martin's Griffin, $13.95.) In Galant's satirical debut novel, old-timers face off against a family of parvenus in a suburban development built over a snake sanctuary.</p>
