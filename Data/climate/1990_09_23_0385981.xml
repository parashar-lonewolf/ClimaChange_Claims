        <p>LEAD: If Saddam Hussein could have placed his own man in this country to increase: electrical costs, use of OPEC oil, our trade deficit and pollution from fossil fuels, he couldn't have picked a better man than what our own Governor, Mario M. Cuomo, has done for Long Island.</p>
        <p>If Saddam Hussein could have placed his own man in this country to increase: electrical costs, use of OPEC oil, our trade deficit and pollution from fossil fuels, he couldn't have picked a better man than what our own Governor, Mario M. Cuomo, has done for Long Island.</p>
        <p>The shame of Governor Cuomo's closing of Shoreham for parochial interests is now upon us. Long Island now has the highest electrical rate in the nation and despite the need to reduce oil imports, we're importing an extra 20,000 barrels of oil every day.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, almost all of our local politicians, afraid of the Governor's growing political power, parrotted his false rantings about plant safety and evacuation procedures.</p>
        <p>Shoreham can still be opened, but it will require our legislators to come out of the chicken coop and speak out for what is right. If you're concerned, write your congressman.</p>
