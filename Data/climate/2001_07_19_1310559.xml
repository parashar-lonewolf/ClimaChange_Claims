        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki's administration came out today against a Bush administration proposal for oil and gas drilling in the Finger Lakes National Forest, after the governor came under fire for refusing to take a position on the issue.</p>
        <p>Erin M. Crotty, commissioner of the Department of Environmental Conservation, released a statement this afternoon saying that her agency ''strongly opposes any drilling for oil and natural gas that disturbs the national forest.'' The drilling plan under consideration by the Department of the Interior would give leases to private companies for the drilling rights to about 13,000 acres in Finger Lakes National Forest, which is northwest of Ithaca between Cayuga and Seneca Lakes.</p>
        <p>The national forest encompasses dense forests, steep gorges, deep lakes, wineries and small towns in a region that is heavily dependent on tourism.</p>
        <p>Ms. Crotty announced: ''At Governor Pataki's direction, D.E.C. will formally communicate its position to the U.S. Forest Service and the federal Bureau of Land Management.''</p>
        <p>Officially, the governor's position is merely one of thousands of comments being delivered to the federal government on the plan. It remains to be seen how much weight Mr. Pataki's opposition will carry with the Bush administration, which has run into fierce opposition, in Congress and elsewhere, over its plans to expand oil and gas drilling in places like the Gulf of Mexico, the Great Lakes and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.</p>
        <p>Especially in recent weeks, environmentalists have attacked both the drilling plan and Mr. Pataki, and the Democrats hoping to challenge his re-election next year are beginning to make Finger Lakes drilling a campaign issue. State Comptroller H. Carl McCall issued a statement today calling the governor's silence on the issue disturbing, and Andrew M. Cuomo, the former federal housing secretary, had planned a news conference for Thursday morning in the national forest with environmentalists to criticize Mr. Pataki.</p>
        <p>Over the last several days, the administration had declined to take a position on the drilling plan. As recently as Tuesday, Mr. Pataki himself did the same, saying, ''We have not been asked by either side to weigh in on that issue.''</p>
        <p>Michael McKeon, the governor's communications director, said Mr. Pataki was not prepared Tuesday to take the position he took today ''because our review wasn't completed.''</p>
        <p>Several environmental lobbyists said they had expected all along that Mr. Pataki would oppose Finger Lakes drilling, and were surprised only that he was slow to do so. In six years in office, the governor has won considerable praise from environmental groups, along with some criticism, and his commitment to conservation is an important piece of his appeal to moderate voters.</p>
        <p>The governor's opposition to Finger Lakes drilling is one in a string of environmental issues on which he has opposed the president, including Mr. Bush's Arctic drilling plan, his reversal of a Clinton administration plan for stricter rules on arsenic in drinking water, and his retreat from a treaty to combat global warming.</p>
