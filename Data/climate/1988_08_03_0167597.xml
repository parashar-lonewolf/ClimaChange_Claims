        <p>LEAD: As it has across the Great Plains of the United States, drought has ravaged grain and cattle farms in Canada with a severity not seen since the 1930's, and some of those affected have given up.</p>
        <p>As it has across the Great Plains of the United States, drought has ravaged grain and cattle farms in Canada with a severity not seen since the 1930's, and some of those affected have given up.</p>
        <p>In the worst-hit region, an area of southern Saskatchewan and Alberta that borders on Montana, the landscape has evoked memories of the ''dust bowl'' years of a half century ago. Hot winds accompanying the drought have stripped the topsoil, creating huge dust storms. Water basins called sloughs that are used for irrigation and watering cattle have dried up, leaving mud bottoms as dry and hard as asphalt. When the winds blow, great balls of tumbleweed roll and bounce across the prairie.</p>
        <p>Across Canada's northlands this summer, tour operators have seen an increase in the number of vacations taken by farmers in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, prairie provinces where farmers usually work dawn to dusk from the spring thaw to the onset of winter.</p>
        <p>''We've had people up here who've walked away from their crops,'' said Glenda Bolt, a tour guide in Dawson, 175 miles from the Arctic Circle. ''When you ask them about it, they say, 'We'll hear from the kids if it gets any better.' ''</p>
        <p>With the prairie grain crop expected to fall by a third from 1987 levels, to about 33 million tons, and hundreds of cattle ranchers sending some of their finest animals to premature slaughter for lack of feed, it is a bitter time for families that have endured a decade of hardships. Even the rains that fell in parts of the prairies in late June and July came too late for the most hard-pressed among them, adding to the number of bankruptcies, which was already at near-record levels. Fourth Drought Since 1980</p>
        <p>The drought, which had lasted seven months in some regions before the mid-summer rains, is the fourth since 1980 to parch regions of Canada that have prided themselves since World War I on being, along with the United States plains states to the south, the ''breadbasket of the world.'' And between the droughts of 1980, 1984, 1985 and this year, grain farmers have had to contend with worldwide surpluses, a punishing fall in prices and subsidy wars between the United States and western Europe.</p>
        <p>As surpluses have been depleted in the face of the drought, prices have begun to shoot up. Effective Monday, the Canadian Wheat Board, the Government agency that sets prices paid to farmers, raised prices by some of the biggest margins ever.</p>
        <p>Prices that had already increased in April jumped again; barley prices nearly doubled from the spring rate to $98 a ton, and durum wheat leaped by 59 percent to $143 a ton.</p>
        <p>The price increases were of little comfort to the worst-hit farmers, some of whom had already plowed under 50 percent or more of their crops. And even with the rains, the average rainfall for many prairie areas was still 40 to 60 percent below average for the year. Rain 'Too Little, Too Late'</p>
        <p>John Bendell, a spokesman for Environment Canada, the Government agency that monitors the weather, said the rainfall that began in late June was ''too little, too late for a lot of the crops.''</p>
        <p>With the harvest in most areas still ahead, estimates of the effect on Canada's grain exports vary. But Canadian shipping companies are preparing for the possibility that, in the worst case, as few as four million metric tons will move through the country's eastern ports this year, down from 13 million metric tons in 1987. Already, more than 450 grain handlers have been temporarily laid off in Thunder Bay, Ontario, a port on Lake Superior that handles much of the prairie grain.</p>
        <p>About two dozen ships that navigate the St. Lawrence Seaway to the Atlantic have been reported idled by the shortage of grain shipments. Canada Steamship Lines Ltd. of Montreal, the largest Canadian shipping company, has seen at least 3 of its 30 ships idled. ''We are feeling the pinch,'' said Paul Martin Jr., the chairman of the company, which does nearly 40 percent of its business in grain transportation from Great Lakes ports. Other Businesses Affected</p>
        <p>In other businesses, the effects may be equally severe. Some of the country's leading pasta manufacturers denounced the Wheat Board price increases after a meeting three weeks ago in Winnipeg.</p>
        <p>Altruism, too, has been adversely affected. Bert Loewen, executive director of the Canadian Food Grains Bank, a private relief agency that has shipped thousands of tons of grain to countries in Africa ravaged by drought and civil war, said the agency expected to dispatch a ship to Africa this month with 600 tons of grain. But the agency depends on Government financing pegged to farmers' donations, and Mr. Loewen said farmers' donations have dropped sharply. Even Wealthy Farmers Worry</p>
        <p>Even for wealthy farmers, the drought has compounded major doubts about the future. Men like Douglas Bryan, who farms 16,000 acres outside Central Butte, Saskatchewan, have experienced new difficulty in servicing the heavy debts accumulated in amassing their acreages. Mr. Bryan, who is 56 years old, told The Globe and Mail, the Toronto newspaper, that he made a mistake in buying 50 smaller farms in pursuit of economies of scale, only to find grain prices, and now grain yields, falling disastrously. ''That's a tragic story for a guy who has farmed since 1946,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Like their counterparts in the United States, weather experts in Canada are wondering whether the drought is a harbinger of repeated hot, dry summers to come. The lack of rain on the prairies followed a winter with one of the lowest snowfalls in decades - so low that snow had to be trucked in to some of the venues used for the Winter Olympic Games in Calgary. Since 1981, rainfall in parts of the Canadian prairies has dropped by 50 to 90 percent.</p>
        <p>Some experts attribute the drop to the greenhouse effect, the warming of the earth's atmosphere promoted primarily by the burning of carbon-based fuels. Elaine Wheaton, a climatologist for the Saskatchewan Research Council, said that the weather patterns so far remain within the range that has been recorded over decades on the prairies, although at the warm, dry end of the scale. ''It could well be a trial run for the greenhouse,'' she told Maclean's magazine. ''We can't say for sure, but it is one of the severest weather patterns we have ever had.''</p>
