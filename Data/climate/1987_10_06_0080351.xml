        <p>A cylinder of ice nearly a mile and a half long, painstakingly drawn from the Antarctic icecap by a Soviet and French scientific expedition, has documented 160,000 years of the earth's climate, revealing a surprisingly precise connection between changes in temperature and in the amount of carbon dioxide in the air.</p>
        <p>''Fortunately, nature has been taking continuous samples of the atmosphere at the surface of the ice sheets throughout the ages,'' the scientists report in the journal Nature. The Soviet-French data reach back past the ice age that ended 10,000 years ago to the ice age before.</p>
        <p>As carbon dioxide concentration falls, so does temperature. As carbon dioxide concentration rises - and it is rising with unprecedented speed now, because of human activity -temperature rises, too. In what is known as the greenhouse effect, atmospheric carbon dioxide traps heat that would otherwise be radiated out to space.</p>
        <p>Although the researchers stop short of claiming to have demonstrated a cause-and-effect relationship, they have provided the strongest evidence to date of a link between climate and carbon dioxide. They suggest that carbon dioxide, produced and consumed by biological processes on land and in the oceans, is part of a complex feedback loop, sharply amplifying small changes in the amount of sunlight that reaches earth.</p>
