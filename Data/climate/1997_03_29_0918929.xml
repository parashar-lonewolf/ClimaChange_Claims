        <p>Speaker Newt Gingrich told China's Communist Party leaders on Friday that they would have to begin tolerating freedom of speech, assembly and religion if they wanted the respect of Hong Kong, Taiwan and the international community.</p>
        <p>Speaking far more bluntly than Vice President Al Gore, who visited China this week, Mr. Gingrich called on China's leaders to release political prisoners, stop arresting religious leaders and cooperate with the United States to track down any ''renegade'' Chinese officials who might have tried to funnel illegal campaign contributions to American politicians.</p>
        <p>But at the same time, the Speaker of the House said in an interview here and in a speech to business executives in Hong Kong that Washington sought an approach to China that would promote the rule of law and greater religious freedom. He repeated his Hong Kong speech here this morning to a group of students.</p>
        <p>''I mean, we don't want people in jail,'' he said in an interview at the China World Hotel after his meeting with President Jiang Zemin. ''We don't want persecution of people who are engaged in religion.'' China routinely arrests and persecutes Catholic clerics who are not members of the state-controlled Catholic Patriotic Association.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gingrich said Congress would like to play its own role in opening a dialogue with Chinese leaders under a ''coordinated foreign policy'' with the Administration. In his speech this morning, he said American emphasis on democracy was ''the greatest gift'' the United States could give to the world.</p>
        <p>The Speaker's muscular formulation of American expectations for China and his commitment to support President Clinton's policy of engagement reflected the political pressure on Mr. Gingrich as he tries to recover from an ethics investigation, even as new criticism arises over his ideological commitment to the ''Republican revolution.''</p>
        <p>His trenchant remarks about repression were an effort to appease the hard-line wing of the Republican Party, which has been calling for a tougher line on China, while his offer to open a new lines of discussion was an attempt to stay within the bounds of statesmanship.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gingrich said he had held extensive discussions with President Clinton, Vice President Gore, the State Department and the National Security Council before delivering these messages, but it is not clear how great an expansion of Congressional involvement in China policy he expects.</p>
        <p>He said he would ''regularly'' dispatch Representative Douglas Bereuter of Nebraska, chairman of the House subcommittee on Asia, to consult with Chinese officials on issues of contention. ''He's there to help,'' Mr. Gingrich said. ''He's not there to judge. He's not there to interfere.''</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Gore before him, Mr. Gingrich divided his time between tricky meetings with Chinese leaders and sightseeing excursions. Wearing pin stripes and holding hands with his more casually dressed wife, Marianne, the Speaker led his Congressional flock through the Forbidden City. Chinese tourists were pushed aside by the police.</p>
        <p>Naturally, the Speaker with a Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton in his House office wanted to go to the National History Museum. ''Do you want to go see the dinosaurs with me?'' he asked reporters excitedly.</p>
        <p>Unlike Mr. Gore, who seemed a bit stiff as he pulled out his charts on carbon dioxide emissions, Mr. Gingrich seemed to relish the opportunity to argue history with the Chinese.</p>
        <p>''They don't apparently get many historians coming through,'' he said. ''These are people who pride themselves on depth of history, on complexity and thinking strategically, and I think it's been sort of enjoyable to swap.''</p>
        <p>The arrival in Beijing of Mr. Gingrich and a 12-member bipartisan Congressional delegation followed a four-day visit by Mr. Gore, the highest-level American official to visit China since the Tiananmen massacre of 1989. Mr. Gingrich and his colleagues met on Friday with President Jiang, Prime Minister Li Peng and other senior officials.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Gore, Mr. Gingrich said the Chinese had raised and denied allegations that they had illegally funneled money into American political campaigns.</p>
        <p>''I simply said that on the assumption that their Government statement that they were not involved is true, that meant there were apparently renegades that were violating both our law'' and Chinese Government policy ''and that we would appreciate their help as we seek to determine who these renegades are.'' The Chinese response ''was neither positive nor negative,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Where Mr. Gore gingerly admonished Beijing on the need for political reform and for greater protection of human rights, Mr. Gingrich spoke more bluntly.</p>
        <p>''I characterized Hong Kong as an orchid,'' he said. ''It is very delicate, and a giant can crush an orchid while having the best of intentions.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore bypassed Hong Kong on his trip, but Mr. Gingrich stopped there on Thursday to deliver a pointed speech about freedom as the British colony prepares for its return to Chinese sovereignty on July 1.</p>
        <p>''No American leader would be true to our tradition if they came here and congratulated you on your economic achievements without also saying we believe that economic vitality ultimately depends on political and personal freedom,'' Mr. Gingrich told an American Chamber of Commerce audience. ''For that reason, America cannot remain silent about the lack of basic freedom -- speech, religion, assembly, the press -- in China.</p>
        <p>''The truth is that any effort to provide a partial freedom to any people, to tell them that they can be free in one sphere but not in another, will ultimately fail. China needs to understand that political freedom must accompany economic freedom.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gingrich emphasized his concern about religious freedom, an issue that the right wing of his party has taken up as a cause celebre. Sixty-five members of Congress sent a letter with Mr. Gingrich for delivery to President Jiang saying China's Christians believed that ''this is the worst period of persecution for them since the Cultural Revolution.'' The letter called on China's leaders to recognize ''the deep concern in our country and in the U.S. Congress about the increased persecution of those who worship outside the aegis of official churches.''</p>
        <p>A relaxation of religious persecution began in the 1980's, and millions of Chinese have since joined officially supervised churches, but they have also flocked to underground churches, which are subject to frequent campaigns of repression like the one that has been under way since 1994.</p>
        <p>Before his arrival, Mr. Gingrich discussed with aides the idea of inviting leaders of China's underground Roman Catholic Church to meet with him, but he indicated here that the plan had been abandoned as too risky. Instead, he will attend an Easter service at a Government-supervised Protestant church in Shanghai.</p>
        <p>''Part of the tightrope we are walking on,'' Mr. Gingrich said, ''is that it is easy for American politicians to come in here and have a nice press event and then leave behind an imprisoned person, and so we are following the embassy's guidance with great care.''</p>
