        <p>William H. Gates had business before all three branches of government today.</p>
        <p>In the morning, Mr. Gates -- the founder of the Microsoft Corporation and still considered the world's richest man despite the battering his company's stock has taken lately -- met with lawmakers on both sides of the Capitol, where he expressed confidence his company would overturn a federal judge's stinging ruling this week that Microsoft had violated antitrust laws.</p>
        <p>In the afternoon, at a White House conference on the new economy, he sat side by side with President Clinton, whose administration had taken him to court. He stuck to the president's agenda -- how to spread technology to the poor -- and studiously avoided any mention of the court case.</p>
        <p>''If you're invited to a forum on global warming, you don't talk about saving the Social Security trust fund,'' explained Ginny Terzano, a Microsoft spokeswoman, who used to work at the White House. ''It would have been inappropriate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gates also had some business between the White House and the Capitol, at Washington's federal courthouse, but it wasn't on his itinerary. Microsoft's lawyers appeared before Federal  District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who ruled against Microsoft on Monday. Judge Jackson set a May 24 hearing on sanctions against the software giant.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gates's visit to Washington showed the many sides of the man.</p>
        <p>In court documents filed by the Justice Department, he is portrayed as a ruthless monopolist who built his own wealth at the expense of the marketplace. Mr. Clinton, however, invited him to the White House to highlight his philanthropic efforts through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.</p>
        <p>Lawmakers, meanwhile, were aware of his growing political influence. Microsoft topped the list of computer industry contributors to political campaigns last year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, with $1.2 million going almost equally to Democrats and Republicans.</p>
        <p>Microsoft has long preferred to focus on Washington State, where the company is based, rather than on Washington D.C. But the company has clearly come to realize the need to operate on both coasts.</p>
        <p>Today's version of ''Mr. Gates Goes to Washington'' began about 9:15 a.m. In four back-to-back meetings with House and Senate Democrats and Republicans, Mr. Gates was treated neither as a victim nor a villain, but as a national treasure whose fate in the courts has yet to play out.</p>
        <p>''He was treated like an icon of the new economy,'' said Representative Norman Dicks, a Washington Democrat who set up Mr. Gates's meeting with about 50 House Democrats.  ''People are willing to wait and see how the lawsuit plays out. The sentiment was that members would like this to settle.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gates has plenty of detractors, of course, especially in the Silicon Valley districts that are home to Microsoft's chief competitors. But the naysayers were nowhere to be found today.</p>
        <p>''We were very upset and disappointed by the court decision,'' said Representative Jennifer Dunn, a Washington Republican who arranged Mr. Gates's meeting with about 60 House Republicans. ''He was encouraged by our members to hang in there and never, never give up. He said he believes he'll win on appeal.''</p>
        <p>In a wide-ranging discussion with about a dozen Senate Democrats, Mr. Gates covered subjects from education to health care to the global economy, and the roles industry and Congress play.</p>
        <p>Next stop was an hour with House Republicans, where Mr. Gates, after brief introductory remarks that did not touch on the court decision, forecast a technological future in which even technology-shy lawmakers would carry their daily schedules in a tablet device, and the Internet would be a staple of work and personal lives.</p>
        <p>An hour later, before House Democrats who are trying to burnish their image with the high-technology community, Mr. Gates fielded questions about the so-called digital divide between those enjoying the wealth and advantages that flow from access to computers and the Internet versus those who may be left behind in the race to improve their lives. He also put in a plug for high-technology industries' need for more H-1B visas for software specialists and other technical workers, a measure that is now pending in both the House and Senate.</p>
        <p>When one Democrat groused that the booming economy had bypassed his district, leaving some highly qualified engineers unemployed, Mr. Gates insisted the legislator send him their resumes.</p>
        <p>Instead of tapping into Mr. Gates's software expertise, White House officials invited him to the conference because of his philanthropic efforts. He participated in a panel discussion on how best to bring health, education and technology to poor people the world over.</p>
        <p>''The work he's doing around the world, we have admiration for,'' said a senior White House official. ''As far as the company and its practices, we had a problem with that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gates was able to make a similar distinction. His aides say he considers the Justice Department to be the entity pushing the suit against his company, not the White House. He also keeps in mind, they said, that the federal government is one of Microsoft's largest clients.</p>
        <p>But there was clearly a bit of angst on both sides before Mr. Gates arrived at the White House.</p>
        <p>After the court ruling this week, John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, checked with Joel I. Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust division, to determine whether Mr. Gates's participation in the White House was appropriate. No objection was made.</p>
        <p>Aides to Mr. Gates also called the White House after the ruling to determine whether Mr. Gates's invitation, which was issued a month ago, was still valid. It was.</p>
        <p>''It didn't appear to be awkward in any way,'' Trevor Neilson, a spokesman for the Gates Foundation, said of his boss's White House visit.</p>
        <p>And despite Mr. Gates's dire warnings about what effect government meddling would have on his company, he sounded positive about the future, sanctions or no sanctions.</p>
        <p>''We're at the beginning of what the computer can do to change our lives,'' he said at the White House. ''The best is yet to come.''</p>
