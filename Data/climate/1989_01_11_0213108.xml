        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Andrew Solow (''Pseudo-Scientific Hot Air,'' Op-Ed, Dec. 28) disparages the concern expressed by scientists over global warming. He apparently has learned little from recent experience with earth's ozone layer.</p>
        <p>The notion that carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion will increase the natural greenhouse effect and warm the earth originated about 100 years ago. Over the last century, cars have replaced horses, airplanes have replaced schooners, quantum theory has supplanted classical physics. But the greenhouse theory remains, its predictions consistent with the warming trend observed as atmospheric carbon dioxide has climbed by 25 percent.</p>
        <p>From a longer perspective, analysis of bubbles of ancient air trapped in ice deep under Antarctica shows that carbon dioxide and global temperature have varied in lockstep over the last 150,000 years. Despite uncertainties, computer predictions provide ample evidence that burning even a fraction of our available fossil fuel would warm the earth by more than it cooled during the last ice age, when New York was buried deep under a glacier. There is simply no choice: fossil-fuel burning must be restrained eventually.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the usual wait-and-see response to predicted catastrophes is foreclosed because the consequences of warming build gradually, long after emission of the causative gases. As noted in a report published last year by the United Nations Environment Program and the World Meteorological Organization, groups not known for resort to excess, ''it would be inappropriate to postpone action until the consequences of warming, which lag behind emissions, are clearly visible.''</p>
        <p>On the consumption of fossil fuels, Mr. Solow contends that ''policies that curtail such activities will reduce our living standard.'' Has he considered that Germany and Japan attain the same unit of economic output using half as much energy as the United States; or that our gross national product grew more than one-third over the last 15 years, while energy use hardly budged? Has he considered the consequences of smog and acid rain, both originating in fossil fuel energy sources, for our living standard, or that solar energy, for example, produces neither pollutant?</p>
        <p>When prudent scientists like F. S. Rowland warned of the dangers of ozone depletion by chlorofluorocarbons, the cry ''it's only a theory'' was heard, as it is now about global warming. The doubters should have learned with the advent of the ozone hole a lesson that world leaders from Mikhail S. Gorbachev to Margaret Thatcher are now proclaiming: Don't mess with the global environment. Fortunately, the ozone hole occurred over Antarctica. We may not be so fortunate the next time. MICHAEL OPPENHEIMER  New York, Dec. 29, 1988  The writer is senior scientist for the Environmental Defense Fund.</p>
