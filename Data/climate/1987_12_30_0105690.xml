        <p>Noye Monroe Johnson, a Dartmouth College geology professor who did early research on acid rain, died of cancer at his home here Sunday, school officials said Monday. He was 57 years old.</p>
        <p>In the 1960's Mr. Johnson and two other Dartmouth professors, F. Herbert Bormann, now at Yale University, and Gene Likens, now at Cornell University, analyzed drainage from the watersheds at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire. They discovered high levels of sulfates and concluded the chemical had come from the atmosphere, falling to earth in precipitation. They called the phenomenom acid rain.</p>
        <p>Professor Johnson graduated from the University of Kansas and was a Navy officer in the Korean War before getting his master's degree and doctorate at the University of Wisconsin. He joined the Dartmouth faculty in 1961.</p>
        <p>Professor Johnson is survived by his wife, Dolores, the acting director of student activities at Dartmouth, and two daughters, Deborah and Anne.</p>
