        <p>AS climate experts firm up their view that human activity is seriously altering the atmosphere, one voice stands out in clarion dissent. It is that of Dr. Richard S. Lindzen of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a shoemaker's son from the Bronx who has risen through the academic hierarchy as a leading expert on the physical processes of the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Is there truly cause to worry that emissions of waste industrial gases that trap heat like carbon dioxide could disrupt the world's climate?</p>
        <p>Dr. Lindzen does not equivocate. "We don't have any evidence that this is a  serious problem," he says flatly, with precise diction, in a friendly voice that resonates strongly in his 17th-floor office overlooking Boston across the Charles River. A clutter of folders and papers, coupled with Dr. Lindzen's untrimmed black beard and hornrim glasses, suggest the academic theorist he is.</p>
        <p>His opinions attacking the formal consensus about climate change have made the 56-year-old Dr. Lindzen a bete noir to environmentalists who trumpet the dangers of global warming and a champion to political conservatives and industrial interests who minimize the threat.  Admirers see him as a force for intellectual honesty in a highly politicized debate. Critics fault him for professing unwarranted sureness in a field of research rife with uncertainty. Many say he is simply wrong.</p>
        <p>But everyone takes him with the utmost seriousness because of a reputation for brilliance that got him elected to the National Academy of Sciences at age 37. It is in this sense that his voice stands out from the relatively small group of greenhouse scientists who speak out boldly and publicly in dissent.</p>
        <p>Last fall, a panel of scientists convened by the United Nations to advise the world's governments concluded for the first time that greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide are probably responsible, at least in part, for a changing global climate. The panel also predicted that if emissions of the gases are not reduced, the average global temperature will increase by 1.8 degrees to 6.3 degrees Fahrenheit -- with a best estimate of 3.6 degrees -- by the year 2100. The predicted warming, according to the United Nations panel, would be accompanied by widespread climatic disruption.</p>
        <p>Bunk, says Dr. Lindzen. He says the conclusions are based on computerized models of the climate system so flawed as to be meaningless. Everyone recognizes that the models are imperfect, but Dr. Lindzen goes much farther. "I do not accept the model results as evidence," he says, because trusting them "is like trusting a ouija board." Furthermore, he argues, the physics of the atmosphere permit only a minor and untroubling warming despite the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>His assertions have subjected him to a barrage of criticism from the modeling community and its many scientific allies. Dr. Lindzen has "sacrificed his luminosity by taking a stand that most of us feel is scientifically unsound," said a longtime acquaintance, Dr. Jerry D. Mahlman, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at Princeton University, which runs one of the computer models Dr. Lindzen scorns. Dr. Mahlman nevertheless describes Dr. Lindzen as "a formidable opponent."</p>
        <p>Does Dr. Lindzen feel beaten up on?</p>
        <p>"That's a matter of how thick one's skin is," he said over fried calamari at  a Cambridge restaurant.  It helps, he said, that he gets many calls and letters  from silent skeptics in the scientific community who thank him for his stand. They often do not themselves speak out, he says, because it doesn't pay to be a  skeptic. "Who needs to be in controversies, who needs any of this?" he said. "And in a time of budgetary restraint, climate has gotten good funding. Why spoil a good thing?"</p>
        <p>By the same token, he says, there is a financing advantage in being on the greenhouse bandwagon. Are some people trying to maintain a sense of crisis to get research grants? "Yes," he says, "and it's unconscious and it's natural."</p>
        <p>One who says he basically agrees with Dr. Lindzen's view is Dr. William Gray  of Colorado State University, best known for his predictions of hurricane activity. "A lot of my older colleagues are very skeptical on the global warming thing," said Dr. Gray. He calls Dr. Lindzen's stand "courageous." While some of  the criticisms delivered by Dr. Lindzen may have some flaws, said Dr. Gray, "across the board he's generally very good."</p>
        <p>Another atmospheric scientist cited by Dr. Lindzen as a fellow skeptic, Dr. John M. Wallace of the University of Washington, said there are "relatively few  scientists who are as skeptical of the whole thing as Dick is." Many more, said  Dr. Wallace, take the question of climate change seriously but think that assertions of climate change already in progress have been exaggerated, as he does.</p>
        <p>The object of the conflicting opinions was born in Webster, Mass., in 1940, after his parents fled Hitler's Germany. His shoemaker father later moved the family to the Bronx, where, Dr. Lindzen says, "I think we were the first Jewish  family in an Irish-Catholic neighborhood." There he developed a lifelong enthusiasm for amateur radio and won Regents' and National Merit scholarships at the Bronx High School of Science (class of 1956). He also acquired the middle-class native New Yorker's hardened "G" (as in Lon-GIH-land) that faintly  modifies his otherwise straightforward academic accent today.</p>
        <p>The scholarships propelled him as a student first to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and then to Harvard University, where he was attracted by classical physics, and then atmospheric physics. By his mid-30's he had produced landmark  work in atmospheric dynamics, mainly involving "tides," or regular changes in atmospheric pressure, and the periodic shift in direction of high-level equatorial winds that affect global circulation patterns. After various academic posts, he joined the M.I.T. faculty in 1983, where he is the Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Meteorology.</p>
        <p>In recent years, while pursuing his main interest of atmospheric dynamics in  trying to help "figure out how climate works," he has leveled a variety of criticisms at the idea of serious climatic change, some with telling effect. For instance, he points out, the computer models do not reflect the climate's natural variability very well -- a key shortcoming in trying to gauge the human  effect on climate, one that is readily conceded by the modelers.</p>
        <p>But the Lindzen idea that has attracted most attention is based on a fundamental point of physics: that carbon dioxide and the other waste gases generate only a small amount of warming. Something has to amplify that warming for the larger amount of warming predicted by the United Nations panel to materialize.  The main candidate, whose presumed amplifying effect is built into the computer models, is water vapor -- also a heat-trapping gas, and the most powerful one since there is so much of it and it is so pervasive. The theory is  that a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor, thereby increasing the warming  even more.  Without this amplification, Dr. Lindzen argues, the average global temperature will rise by only about a degree Fahrenheit if atmospheric carbon dioxide is doubled.</p>
        <p>"With all due respect to alarmism," he says, "I don't think anyone has argued that's going to be a major change in life as we know it."</p>
        <p>The amount of warming produced by the doubling of carbon dioxide has become a standard measure of the climate system's sensitivity to change; the United Nations panel figures it at 3 to 8 degrees. But Dr. Lindzen argues that the models which produced those numbers do not properly reflect the physics of the water vapor question. While it is well known that warmer air generally holds more vapor, he says, "we don't know what determines upper level water vapor," a factor he says is crucial, and central to the predictions of future climate change. He has postulated over the years a number of possible atmospheric mechanisms that might nullify the supposed greenhouse amplification. It was Dr.  Lindzen himself who later found the first of these possible mechanisms to be trivial in its effect, but he has advanced others.</p>
        <p>Modelers, who insist that the amplifying effect of water vapor is supported by real-world data, sharply dispute Dr. Lindzen on this point and say he has no  evidence to prove his nullification hypothesis. But other atmospheric scientists say the issue is not yet resolved. "To be fair," Dr. Lindzen says, "the answer at this stage is that we don't know" what the vapor effect is. And in fact, some important aspects of the issue are left uncertain in the United Nations panel's  report.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, he is exploring other ways to test the climate's sensitivity to change. One avenue involves volcanic eruptions. If the climate is not very sensitive, Dr. Lindzen says, the cooling effect produced by the haze from eruptions should dissipate quickly; if it is very sensitive, the effect should linger. So far, he says, it appears that the volcanoes are indicating low sensitivity -- bolstering, if he is right, his over-all argument about warming.</p>
        <p>To some critics, Dr. Lindzen's confidence about the climate's low sensitivity to carbon dioxide emissions embodies more certitude than the facts allow. "I don't know what line from God he has," says Dr. Stephen Schneider of Stanford University, who cites what he sees as the overprecise estimate Dr. Lindzen gives.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lindzen replies that he at least gives some reasons for his estimate rather than simply following a "herd instinct" that he says is very common in science. All in all, he says, "I don't think we've made the case yet" that serious climate change is in prospect, and he therefore sees no cause to worry now. To Dr. Mahlman, Dr. Lindzen is saying, "we don't know nearly as much as we  need to know, therefore we shouldn't have any concern." This view, Dr. Mahlman asserts, is "deeply fallacious."</p>
        <p>Dr. Lindzen traces his decision to begin voicing his doubts to a speaking engagement at Tufts University in the spring of 1989. After he stated his case,  he recalled: "One person after another got up, saying scientists can have their  doubts but we don't have any. I developed this awful feeling that here was an issue that was running away, developing a reality that transcended the science."</p>
        <p>He says he prizes the environment, but that global warming and other issues have prompted environmental groups to go "off the deep end" and produce "a drum  roll that gets rid of perspective." One consequence, he says, is that "if you are questioning the basis of global warming, you are definitely treated as someone who hates the earth -- and that's a little bit odd, because it is, after all, a scientific question."</p>
        <p>Dr. Lindzen has always been a Democrat, too, but he says the global warming controversy has caused him to change parties. The notion that "extremely weak science" could set into motion policies with long-term implications for the economy made him "queasy" about governmental action, he said. In the academic community, he volunteers, laughing, his turn to the Republicans "must have been  like coming out as a gay 25 years ago."</p>
        <p>In 5 or 10 years, Dr. Lindzen says, direct observations of the climate's behavior might well make it clearer who is right in the greenhouse debate. Could he turn out to be wrong when all is said and done?</p>
        <p>"I think it's unlikely," he said, "but it can happen."</p>
