        <p>ICE that has lain undisturbed for hundreds of thousands of years is yielding  clues that may foreshadow our own future when Earth's present warming trend gives way to a new era of glaciation and cold.</p>
        <p>During the Southern Hemisphere summer, which concluded three months ago, scientists from Russia, France and the United States drilled deeply into the South Polar ice sheet at Russia's Vostok Station, recovering ice that formed some 400,000 years ago. The precious core samples of ice brought up from the depths, cylindrical samples totaling nearly two miles in length, include the oldest ice scientists have ever been able to analyze.</p>
        <p>In recent years, two major drilling projects in Greenland have retrieved ice at great depths, but because snowfall in Antarctica, about an inch a year, is only one-tenth as heavy as snowfall in Greenland, a given depth of compacted snow in Antarctica represents an age 10 times as great as it would in Greenland.</p>
        <p>Dr. Todd Sowers, a Pennsylvania State University paleoclimatologist studying  ice core samples that have just arrived from Vostok, said that the hole had penetrated layers of ice that go back in time through at least three and perhaps four complete cycles of global glaciation. Glaciologists disagree as to how long a typical period of glaciation lasts, but many believe that it averages about 100,000 years.</p>
        <p>"The longest continuous climate record we've got from ice cores drilled in Greenland is 110,000 years," he said. "That didn't even get us back into the last interglacial period. The Vostok hole in Antarctica went on to penetrate an  additional 150,000 years, taking us through the last interglacial period, the ice age that preceded it and on into the next interglacial period. During the past summer, we went deeper still, at least doubling the climate record and perhaps quadrupling it, for at least three climate cycles."</p>
        <p>Glaciologists have not yet had time to determine the chronology of cold and warm periods represented by the latest Vostok samples, Dr. Sowers said, but they hope to present some detailed results at a meeting in England in August. One more season of drilling, beginning in the Antarctic spring next October, Dr. Sowers said, should complete the hole and allow the team to cut through ice sediments to a depth representing 500,000 years in the past -- a span encompassing at least three periods of global glaciation.</p>
        <p>Interglacial periods, particularly the parts of them punctuated by rapid changes in climate, interest climatologists because of the light they may shed on the present-day interglacial period. Several research projects focus on an interglacial period called the Younger Dryas, from 16,000 to 10,000 years ago. Global climate conditions then were unstable, returning much of Earth to near-glacial conditions.</p>
        <p>Global warming in our own day could stimulate climate instabilities leading to a similar return to global chilling and the growth of ice sheets, some scientists believe.</p>
        <p>The hole at Vostok could be drilled even deeper, but Russian radar crews have identified a lake of liquid water, about the size of Lake Ontario, resting on bedrock beneath more than two miles of ice under Vostok Station. The water in the lake, kept liquid by geological heat and pressure, has probably been trapped for more than half a million years.</p>
        <p>Tapping the lake with the present drill rig would contaminate it badly with drilling oil and other substances, which could damage any living organisms there. The international body that supervises all Antarctic research that might  affect the continent's environment -- the Scientific Committee for Antarctic Research, known as SCAR -- is unlikely to approve any project that would contaminate the lake. The committee is expected to discuss the possibilities at  a meeting in August at Cambridge University in England.</p>
        <p>To sample ice, scientists use tubular drills that cut cylindrical ice cores as they descend. The drills are lubricated by diesel oil. A typical ice core sample is about 30 feet long, and many of the cores retrieved from Vostok and other holes are kept frozen at the National Ice Core Laboratory in Denver, to which they are transported by freezer vans.</p>
        <p>The exact dimensions of Vostok's subglacial lake have been revealed by radar, and the Vostok drilling equipment will get no closer than about 150 feet to the  top of the liquid water. But even without going deeper, scientists expect a bonanza of information from the deep ice. The deeper they drill, the greater is  the span of time represented by each foot of depth because of the compression of the layers under two miles of ice.</p>
        <p>The hope is that samples from Vostok and other Antarctic sites, combined with analyses of ice cores from two completed drilling projects on the Greenland Ice  Sheet, will enable scientists to piece together the atmospheric, marine and continental chronology and mechanisms leading to global climate changes, including those that might cast a new mantle of ice over much of the world's temperate zones within the next century or so.</p>
        <p>Despite the immense stretches of geological time represented by ice ages, there is growing evidence that abrupt, short-term climate changes leading to worldwide flooding or glaciation have been fairly common in the past and that people alive today might experience such a change in their own lifetimes. Such an interval might last only a few hundred years, like the "Little Ice Age" that  chilled Europe beginning around 1400, but its social effects might be severe.</p>
        <p>In a paper published last month by the journal Nature, Dr. Paul A. Mayewski of the University of New Hampshire, in Durham, and colleagues at the Desert Research Institute, in Reno, and the Universities of New Hampshire, Washington and Miami, presented new evidence that global climate changes could occur abruptly.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, Dr. Michael Bender of the University of Rhode Island and his colleagues reported that an analysis of oxygen isotopes in Greenland ice samples suggested that climate change had sometimes been abrupt, at least in the Northern Hemisphere. But ice samples from Vostok in Antarctica showed no such rapid variations, they found.</p>
        <p>The new investigation by Dr. Mayewski's team focused not on Vostok, but on a  coastal Antarctic site similar to the one in Greenland tapped by the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mayewski's team investigated core samples from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet at Taylor Dome, near the Ross Sea. An analysis showed that during a critical period of deglaciation between 10,000 and 16,000 years ago, the climate in the Southern Hemisphere was apparently just as abruptly variable as it was in Greenland.</p>
        <p>Change can come swiftly and with devastating results, particularly if a warming trend causes the collapse of a major ice sheet and raises the global sea level.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mayewski said in an interview that the onset of certain cold periods, not long-term ice ages, but relatively short periods within longer periods of general warming, has occurred in less than 20 years in both Greenland and Antarctica. This suggests that such changes can be global in extent.</p>
        <p>Scientists trying to predict Earth's future climate look to the past for clues embedded in ancient ice, sea and land sediments, tree rings, fossil rats'  nests and many other sources. But paleoclimatologists face problems in meshing the data they collect from different sources.</p>
        <p>One goal of current research is to determine the "phasing" of climatic change in the Arctic and Antarctic. When related climate events occur at different times in different places, inferences can be drawn as to causes and effects, and how changes propagate around the world. When certain climate changes are seen to occur at about the same time in widely separated places, "the possibilities would include something external to the Earth," Dr. Mayewski said. That would support the theory that short-term changes in the output of the sun influence Earth's climate, he said.</p>
        <p>Among the indicators that paleoclimatologists measure are the ratios of two forms of oxygen: oxygen-16 and oxygen-18. It is believed that a high ratio of oxygen-18 to oxygen-16 in molecules of frozen water reflects a relatively high atmospheric temperature at the time the ice formed.</p>
        <p>Scientists also look for "greenhouse" gases, especially carbon dioxide and methane; such gases absorb solar radiation but block the loss of heat by the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Two important indicators of ancient wind-circulation patterns are calcium and sodium. The calcium in ice cores comes almost entirely from air that has passed  over continental land masses, while sodium comes almost exclusively from air mixed with sea spray. Other ions (electrically charged atoms or molecules) also  help scientists reconstruct atmospheric circulation patterns.</p>
        <p>Scientists are also measuring the pressure of trapped air within ice bubbles. By combining this information with temperature estimates, they believe, they can use the bubbles as miniature altimeters to gauge the height above sea level of the ice sheet at various times in the past.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mayewski notes that the most recent rapid-change event, the onset of the  so-called Little Ice Age, occurred about A.D. 1400. That event ended between 1850 and 1900, but the circulation patterns it initiated may still be in effect, he believes.</p>
        <p>"The Little Ice Age may still be going on," Dr. Mayewski said, "although it goes through ups and downs. It may last for another few hundred years."</p>
        <p>To the extent that human activity may tend to warm Earth's atmosphere, Dr. Mayewski believes, the warming could conflict with natural circulation patterns  induced by the Little Ice Age cooling. The result could be a greater number of violent storms and an increasing frequency of El Nino oscillations -- the periodic appearance of a vast pool of warm water in the Pacific Ocean, which strongly influences climate.</p>
        <p>"Evidence accumulated during the last few years suggests that this is actually happening," Dr. Mayewski said. "When I started doing research in Antarctica in the 1960's, we assumed that the Antarctic Ice Sheet was a giant sluggish beast that dominated its own climate, rather than being influenced by short-term changes in global climate. Now we're seeing that at least the edges of the ice sheet are much more sensitive to climate change than we knew.</p>
        <p>"The ice is telling us that climate can radically change within the span of a single human life. That's something to think about."</p>
