        <p>ABC Apologizes for Saying Nicotine Was Manipulated ABC News apologized to Philip Morris and R. J. Reynolds for asserting, on "Day One," that tobacco companies manipulated nicotine levels in cigarettes to addict smokers. "That was a mistake," ABC said, settling a $10 billion libel suit that was to have gone to trial in October.</p>
        <p>ABC will pay the two companies' legal expenses, which could run to $3 million, and the network agreed to apologize twice in prime time, first during the halftime of last night's broadcast of "Monday Night Football" and again on Thursday on "Day One." The legal fees and air time make this one of the costliest libel settlements ever.  [ Page A1. ] Analysts Speak, Intel Stock Falls  Intel shares plunged 7 percent after two analysts, expressing concern about profits, trimmed their earnings estimates. The shares dropped $4.625, to $60.25, after hitting a lofty $76 just a month ago.  [ D8. ] A New Culprit in Peso's Collapse  Why did the Mexican peso collapse last winter? At first, a drop in foreign investment was seen as the culprit, but a report by the International Monetary Fund points to Mexican investors who sent billions out of the country. The Clinton Administration may face criticism for the billions it poured in, but the report agreed that a rescue was needed.  [ D5. ] Is Warner-Lambert Next?  Is Warner-Lambert the next drug maker ripe for merger, now that Upjohn and Pharmacia of Sweden have joined forces? Perhaps, but investors should see a cautionary lesson in the uneven ride that both Upjohn and Pharmacia shares have taken. Both stocks fell sharply at first, then rebounded after the companies met with analysts to explain the deal's merits. Market Place.  [ D8. ] Dow Rises, Then Gives It Back  Stocks had a bumpy day, with the Dow industrials quickly rising nearly 40 points, then retreating as a weak outlook for Intel led technology stocks down. The Dow closed at 4,614.78 points, off 2.82, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq lost 11.58 points, or more than 1 percent, closing at 1,019.70, after setting a string of record highs last week.  [ D8. ] Bond Prices Rise Slightly  Bond prices rose in thin trading, reflecting optimism among a few buyers that the Federal Reserve might lower interest rates when it meets today -- an action that most analysts don't expect.  [ D18. ] Restraint on 'Greenhouse Gases'  Manufacturers urged the Clinton Administration not to make new vows to cut "greenhouse gas" emissions at talks that opened yesterday in Geneva. The manufacturers said there would be "significant harm to the U.S. economy" in proposals to reduce such gases, which some fear cause a warming of the atmosphere.  [ D2. ] Arakis Shares Plunge on Doubts  Arakis Energy's shares plunged as investors questioned its ambitious but obscure plans to finance a huge oil and pipeline project in the Sudan with funds from a little-known Saudi prince. The stock fell $4.50, to close at $13.50 yesterday.  [ D2. ] Surfing the Internetplex  Film promotion on the Internet? Of course. Nearly every studio has a "home page" on the World Wide Web, offering stills, cast biographies, soundtracks, entire trailers. Star-struck viewers can even send E-mail to actors and directors (no response promised). Advertising.  [ D6. ] Aetna Pressure on Doctors Charged  Contending that Aetna pressured doctors to join its health care plan on Long Island, physicians at three hospitals filed an antitrust suit in Federal Court.  [ D4. ] Budget Deficit Narrows  The Federal budget deficit narrowed in July from a year earlier as Government spending slowed and revenue increased.  [ D4. ] Du Pont Fined Over Fungicide  Du Pont was fined $115 million by a Federal judge for concealing evidence in a 1993 trial over possible harm to plants caused by a fungicide.  [ D8. ]</p>
