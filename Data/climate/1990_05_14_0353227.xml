        <p>LEAD: John Sununu may be expanding the previous limits of an office that is neither elective nor subject to Congressional confirmation. He seems clearly to be the most openly powerful White House chief of staff of the several who in recent years have been closely at a President's side.</p>
        <p>John Sununu may be expanding the previous limits of an office that is neither elective nor subject to Congressional confirmation. He seems clearly to be the most openly powerful White House chief of staff of the several who in recent years have been closely at a President's side.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sununu, the conservative former Governor of New Hampshire, is by no means the first powerful staff chief. Sherman Adams in the Eisenhower Administration and H. R. Haldeman in the Nixon Administration come immediately to mind. Both, however, wielded mostly organizational and procedural power, considerable as that is; neither intervened in the substance of issues to the extent Mr. Sununu appears to do.</p>
        <p>Both James Baker, now the Secretary of State, and Donald Regan, the first and second chiefs of staff to serve President Reagan, did influence substance; but Mr. Baker was more subtle and less public about it than Mr. Sununu, and Mr. Regan ultimately was fired - a fate not believed likely for the present chief. Mr. Regan's successor, Howard Baker, had to concentrate on damage control following the Iran-contra scandal.</p>
        <p>Some critics think Mr. Sununu is causing rather than controlling political damage to Mr. Bush. His most recent public controversy seems to have resulted in his being slapped down by the President's news secretary, then by the President himself. Or did it? Was the chief of staff just taking the heat for something Mr. Bush wanted said - but did not want to say?</p>
        <p>After Mr. Bush invited Democrats into budget and deficit negotiations with ''no preconditions,'' Mr. Sununu took it on himself to tell reporters, on a flight from Costa Rica to Washington, what the President really meant to say - that the Democrats could propose new taxes but the White House would ''have the prerogative to say no, and I emphasize the no.''</p>
        <p>That not only alarmed Democrats, who already feared that Mr. Bush intended to set just such a trap for them; it also upset some Republicans, who worried that Mr. Sununu's remark was untimely enough to sabotage the budget negotiations. In a rebuke unprecedented in my memory of White House press secretaries, usually a restrained lot, Marlin Fitzwater labeled Mr. Sununu's words ''crazy.'' Mr. Bush told other reporters on another flight that ''there are no conditions and that's the way it is.''</p>
        <p>Vice President Quayle, either not getting the word from the top or helping to placate conservatives who fear Mr. Bush will agree to raise taxes, cast his lot with Mr. Sununu. The staff chief, he said, ''was just reflecting what the President's instincts are, what his stated policies are.''</p>
        <p>All this came on top of Mr. Sununu's role in causing the Bush Administration to renege on an international agreement. Industrial nations had agreed to provide aid to help developing countries stop the use of chemicals damaging to the ozone layer; but Mr. Sununu and Richard Darman, the budget director, decided that the U.S. should not contribute its share after all. Their view that the money should be put up by international agencies prevailed over that of William K. Reilly, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>This was not the chief of staff's only victory over Mr. Reilly. Despite campaign promises by Mr. Bush in 1988, the Administration insisted at a recent White House conference on global warming that not enough was known about this threat, so that more research was the real need. That reflected Mr. Sununu's belief and avoided a more specific Administration commitment to an international effort to slow global warming.</p>
        <p>It was Mr. Sununu who said publicly last week that the President would veto a parental-leave bill approved in the House. This could bring more political problems; among 39 Republicans voting for the bill were three women who are their party's candidates for the Senate this year -Lynn Martin of Illinois, Claudine Schneider of Rhode Island and Pat Saiki of Hawaii.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sununu also has been influential in holding Mr. Bush to a strong position against abortion. And last year he angered some state governors at the Charlottesville ''education summit''; as the President publicly proclaimed the Administration's devotion to education, the staff chief was privately telling the governors that Federal funds in that field would be cut.</p>
        <p>Is Mr. Bush leaving a vacuum that Mr. Sununu believes he has to fill? Or is he the Abominable No Man to George Bush's Mr. Nice Guy? Either way, John Sununu throws around lots of weight.</p>
