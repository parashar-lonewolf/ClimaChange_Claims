        <p>At stake in the Senate last week were six million acres of the nation's last virgin forests, a green arc of pine sweeping across most of western Montana. In less time than it takes lawmakers to eat lunch, the Senate voted overwhelmingly to make at least one million acres of that wilderness eligible to be cut to the ground.</p>
        <p>In the finger-pointing afterward, national environmental groups were criticized for being too complacent. The Wilderness Society and the National Audubon Society did not actively oppose the bill until the last few weeks, said Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate. The National Wildlife Federation, the country's largest environmental group, announced that it had no opinion on the legislation, which still faces consideration in the House.</p>
        <p>"They talk like Rambo in their fund-raising letters but the big national groups are wimps when it comes to dealing with the bad guys," said Tim Hermach, executive director of the Native Forest Council, a regional environmental group in Eugene, Ore., that opposes logging in national forests.</p>
        <p>Brock Evans, vice president for national issues in Washington for the National Audubon Society, conceded that the movement is under siege. "What seems to be selling out is trying to get something done in a very rough situation," he said. "It struck me last summer that we're being savaged on the right and attacked on the left and maybe the center cannot hold."</p>
        <p>On one side, leaders of hundreds of state and community environmental groups say the national organizations have become soft and are largely absent from battles over such issues as pollution in minority and rural communities. They also complain that the groups have grown so large and desperate for money that they are accepting financial help from some of the very forces whose disregard for the environment led to the movement.</p>
        <p>"We can't get funding from the national environmental groups for our work," said Linda Campbell, director of Southern Women Against Toxics, in Livingston, Ala. "They're nowhere to be seen in our fights."</p>
        <p>From another direction have come slashing attacks by land owners, timber companies and energy corporations who say the Wildlife Federation and its sister organizations are too rich, too powerful, and so prone to hyperbole about ecological dangers that the economic cost of environmental protection is threatening the American way of life.</p>
        <p>"The big environmental groups in a way polluted themselves with power," said Charles S. Cushman, executive director of the National Inholders Association, a group that represents landowners, ranchers and miners who have property within national parks and forests. "Frankly this movement has become a preservation industry that is mainly interested in preserving itself."</p>
        <p>Leaders of the big environmental groups say that much of the criticism comes from polluters posing as born-again populists. "Look behind the fancy rhetoric and you realize this is a movement to bash environmental groups that is funded by the oil and gas industry, the mining industry and the development community," said Jay D. Hair, the president of the National Wildlife Federation.</p>
        <p>The national groups say that because they are working in a political arena where they have to compromise, they cannot be as aggressive as the new grassroots coalitions that have sprung up by the dozens in militant response to specific problems. These include groups like the Military Production Network, which works on pollution issues that affect the nuclear weapons industry, and the Virginia-based Citizens Clearinghouse for Hazardous Waste, which -- supporters are quick to point out -- is one of the few nationwide environmental groups headed by a woman.</p>
        <p>In the case of the bill to open Montana's wilderness to timbering, mining and oil drilling, staff members of the national environmental groups said they did not want to embarrass Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who negotiated the pact with Montana's Republican Senator, Conrad Burns, in what he said was an effort to balance his state's economic needs with environmental concerns. Mr. Baucus, who has been one of the strongest environmentalists in the Senate, received an award from the Sierra Club for helping defeat a proposal by President Bush last year that would have opened the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling and limited citizens from reviewing proposals for new nuclear power plants. The Senate approved the Montana measure 75 to 22, in large part because it is customary to support the position of a state's two Senators on bills primarily affecting their turf.</p>
        <p>To a large extent the assault on environmentalism is a result of the movement's political successes in the last 20 years. As much smaller organizations in the 1970's, the national groups helped to bring about the world's first comprehensive laws for clearing the air, cleaning the water, protecting wild habitat and safeguarding people from pollutants.</p>
        <p>In the 1980's leading organizations like Greenpeace, The Nature Conservancy, the Environmental Defense Fund, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the World Wildlife Fund doubled in size. The Wildlife Federation, Audubon and the Natural Resources Defense Council built new headquarters in New York and Washington. Staff members introduced a new array of national and worldwide environmental threats like global climate change, depletion of the atmospheric ozone shield, soil erosion, nuclear contamination, ocean pollution, forest destruction, and the accelerating rate of extinction of plants and animals.</p>
        <p>But ever since the passage of the Clean Air Act in the fall of 1990, the groups' influence has waned in Washington and across the country. Efforts by Congress this year to rewrite the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act came to a virtual halt after lawmakers sympathetic to environmental goals determined that both bills could be weakened if they were opened to change.</p>
        <p>According to some of the White House's top environmental aides, President Bush has been emboldened by the confusion he sees in the national groups. In January he announced a 90-day moratorium on new regulations and a review intended to weaken or eliminate existing rules. Two weeks ago, he dropped a Clean Air Act regulation requiring auto makers to install equipment to capture gasoline fumes. Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. sided with the coal industry in a case the industry is pressing to dismantle Government enforcement of strip mining laws. The Environmental Protection Agency proposed rules to weaken Federal hazardous waste laws. Agriculture Secretary Edward R. Madigan wants to limit the ability of environmental groups to stop clear cutting in national forests by barring appeals in the agency's administrative courts.</p>
        <p>Environmental groups count as their one significant victory in the last two years the defeat of the President's 1991 proposal to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling. The bill's failure, though, was also the result of active protests from the utilities and auto industries, which opposed some of the energy conservation measures.</p>
        <p>The environmental groups' problems come amid a recession that has halted growth and made fund-raising a preoccupation. The National Wildlife Federation, the Wilderness Society, the Sierra Club and Greenpeace have all issued layoff notices in the last year and the Natural Resources Defense Council is considering staff cuts. Staff members meanwhile bristle at the six-figure salaries their directors command. Mr. Hair, the president of the National Wildlife Federation, earns $250,000 a year, according to a spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>The financial problems have caused some of the organizations to turn for help to the same industrial polluters they have long criticized. The chairman of Waste Management Inc., which has racked up millions of dollars in environmental fines at its landfills and hazardous waste dumps, is a major contributor and sits on the board of the Wildlife Federation. The National Audubon Society's acclaimed "World of Audubon" television documentaries are financed by the General Electric Company, which has been at the top of the E.P.A.'s list of companies with the most superfund toxic waste sites.</p>
        <p>Frances Beinecke, deputy director for programs at the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York, said that though the messengers are under siege their message is as important as ever.</p>
        <p>"We haven't taken this as seriously as we should have and we're late in responding," she said. "We're still optimistic that the movement as a whole still reflects the commitment of the people in this country to protect fragile resources. But the anti-environmental movement that's developed around the country is a very serious threat to the gains we have made. We have to face up to it and deal with it."</p>
