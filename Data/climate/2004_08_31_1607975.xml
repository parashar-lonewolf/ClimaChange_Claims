        <p>When the Bush administration issued an update last week on federal climate research, it was criticized with equal vigor by environmentalists and by industry-backed groups.</p>
        <p>The update featured new computer simulations showing that the sharp rise in global temperatures since 1970 could only be explained by human influences, mainly rising levels of greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>The administration had never quite crossed that line before, always insisting that uncertainty prevailed. Now it wrote of the ''robustness'' of the findings.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists complained that while the White House seemed to be accepting the growing evidence pointing to harms from human-caused warming, the administration still refused to require cuts in emissions. The industry-backed groups, opposed to such mandates, said the models were flawed and should not have been cited.</p>
        <p>White House officials quickly said the update (at www.climatescience.gov) was never intended as the final word.</p>
        <p>The episode illustrates how advances in research on climate change do not guarantee that a consensus will soon be reached on what to do about it.</p>
        <p>Computer models of climate, particularly, have become a lightning rod in the climate debate, and are likely to remain so for years to come. Run on the world's most powerful computers, they are essentially best-guess re-creations of the way the climate system works, using thousands of equations to simulate the flows of energy, water, air, clouds and pollution in the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>The models provide one of the only tools for unraveling the causes and consequences of climate change, given that it is impossible to run an experiment with the real Earth other than the one that is already under way as greenhouse gases build. They have thus become a cornerstone of calls to limit warming. But they remain rough sketches of reality.</p>
        <p>A few climate scientists contend that the modelers are engaged in a circular exercise with little meaning, building complex simulations of an even more complex real world that contains many features -- at scales ranging from ocean currents to cloud droplets -- that shape climate while still defying scientific understanding.</p>
        <p>But most of the scientists conducting such modeling studies say the field has seen concrete advances.</p>
        <p>As far back as 2001, based substantially on models, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the leading body assessing such research, had already concluded that ''most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities.'' A panel convened by the National Academy of Sciences generally concurred.</p>
        <p>Since then, the models have grown in power and sophistication, mirroring ever more facets of the real atmosphere and oceans, said Dr. Gerald A. Meehl of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., who is the lead author of the paper featured in the administration's research review. The study is one of many aimed at finding which forces determined how global temperatures changed over the 20th century -- warming until 1940, then cooling until the 1970's, then warming again.</p>
        <p>The modeling study by Dr. Meehl and his colleagues included both natural influences on climate -- volcanic plumes that block sunlight and variations in the sun's output -- and human ones, including ozone and dustlike aerosol pollution as well as building emissions of greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>The exercise showed, with more detail than ever, that the warming in the first half of the century was almost certainly natural, while the rising temperatures in the last half were only possible when human activity was included.</p>
        <p>It is just one of a host of new modeling studies that will be used by the international panel for its next climate review, to be issued in 2007.</p>
        <p>Those working in the field agree that the models need refinement. Most important, they say, is improving understanding of the aerosols spewed by smokestacks, unfiltered tailpipes and volcanoes. They were once presumed only to have a cooling influence. Now, however, aerosols are known to cause both cooling and warming, depending on their color and composition and how they affect clouds. Those properties are slowly being incorporated in the simulations.</p>
        <p>But several experts on aerosols published a paper in the journal Science last year warning that such particles were so poorly understood that there was no way to incorporate them into models without adding greatly to uncertainty in the results.</p>
        <p>Given the uncertainties, the authors, led by Dr. Theodore L. Anderson of the University of Washington, said the one-degree warming in the last century could just as easily have been caused by inherent variability in the climate system as by greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>Dr. Richard S. Lindzen, an M.I.T. meteorologist and longtime critic of climate models, said the designers essentially chose values that produced the desired result: significant future warming trends.</p>
        <p>Model designers defend their work, saying there is no way to choose values for the forces affecting climate that produce a desired curve.</p>
        <p>Ronald J. Stouffer, a modeler at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, N.J., noted that many competing simulations had been created by independent teams using different methods -- and they all showed warming.</p>
        <p>''It is the sum of all the papers and analysis that convinces me'' that humans are altering the climate, Mr. Stouffer said.</p>
        <p>But, he and other experts conceded, persuading elected officials to move from accepting the science to curtailing emissions remains a much bigger challenge.</p>
