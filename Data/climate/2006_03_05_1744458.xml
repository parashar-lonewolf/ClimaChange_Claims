        <p>I'M retiring on Saturday, but I don't think of retirement as an opportunity to kick back and do nothing. To me, it's a time when you can really explore those things you already have a passion for. In my case, that's probably going to be vintage car racing and doing something about global warming.</p>
        <p>The beauty of racing is that it gives you immediate feedback when you do well -- which is not something I get in my day job. Maybe it's a guy thing, I don't know, but even as a young person I had a passion for racing cars. I'd always wanted one of those kit cars you assemble yourself. But for a long time I couldn't afford one, and then I guess life just intervened.</p>

        <p>I'M retiring on Saturday, but I don't think of retirement as an opportunity to kick back and do nothing. To me, it's a time when you can really explore those things you already have a passion for. In my case, that's probably going to be vintage car racing and doing something about global warming.</p>
        <p>The beauty of racing is that it gives you immediate feedback when you do well -- which is not something I get in my day job. Maybe it's a guy thing, I don't know, but even as a young person I had a passion for racing cars. I'd always wanted one of those kit cars you assemble yourself. But for a long time I couldn't afford one, and then I guess life just intervened.</p>
        <p>But a dozen or so years ago, I bought a 1959 race car, and since then racing has turned into a major obsession. I own nine race cars; I do 14 or 15 racing weekends a year. In 2004 I was named driver of the year by a major vintage racing group. That was particularly sweet, because it was an election by my peers.</p>
        <p>I love all kinds of cars. I drive a Touareg diesel S.U.V., just because it's fun. I have a 1991 Acura sports car, which I don't drive in bad weather, and I have a Lotus Mark 6, a race car that I now use as a street car. My wife drives a Range Rover, but she also has a '61 Morgan and an '82 BMW convertible. We have four cars crammed into our three-car garage and more parked in the driveway, and the BMW is at our house in Florida.</p>
        <p>This love for cars might seem weird for someone who worries about the environment. But let's face it, there is an absolute human need for entertainment and enjoyment, too. And no matter how many cars I own, I can drive only one of them at a time, so you can't say I'm really contributing that much to global warming.</p>
        <p>In fact, I've been passionate about the environment for 20 years. In 1985, I joined ITT as general manager of its Avionics Division and we discovered solvents in the soil around one of our facilities. They'd probably been there for decades. But then we discovered that a gasoline station next door had tanks that were leaking into the soil, too. We had to clean it all up, and it became clear that it is always better business to deal with environmental problems before they get too serious.</p>
        <p>But being involved in social issues is part of any good business plan. That's why I hate the phrase ''corporate social responsibility.'' Business, not academia or government, is the instrument of productivity, the engine that drives improvements in standards of living.</p>
        <p>I'm chairman of the Prince of Wales International Business Leaders Forum and of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, both of which look at environment and social issues. I joined them years ago because I was frustrated with the absence of business voices on those issues. The Kyoto Protocol has failed in terms of reach and impact. We need a global protocol for measuring, monitoring and reducing greenhouse gases, and it has to go out 50 to 60 years, with milestones along the way. I may not have the bully pulpit of a chief executive anymore, but I'm going to continue speaking and conferring with chief executives who still do. I'm not deeply introspective, but I do want to articulate to others where I am and what I think.</p>
        <p>But I did start off as an engineer, with an interest in mathematics and mechanical things. I've got 15 grandfather clocks that need repair. I've been tracing my family's genealogy, too. I already know that I'm a direct descendant of John Alden and Priscilla Mullens. But until now the research has been from books. I want to travel, walk cemeteries, fill in the fine details. My worst nightmare is that I'll find a census sheet somewhere that lists an ancestor's occupation as inmate.</p>
        <p>And who knows what I'll be doing three, four years from now? I'll probably get passionate about something else.</p>
