        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''How Do You Fix a Broken Planet?'' (Living Section, April 25) highlighted well the frustration of citizens who want to help the environmental cause but are overwhelmed by conflicting advice. While the article noted confusion over garbage management options, it failed to mention the most crucial of all - source reduction.</p>
        <p>Source reduction leads the Environmental Protection Agency's hier-archy of waste management options, followed by recycling, incineration and landfilling. Source reduction is clearly the least costly. It involves no collection or disposal costs and it can reduce the consumption of energy and other valuable natural resources.</p>
        <p>To focus on waste prevention, the following are a few simple steps that can be taken:</p>
        <p>* Buy reusable, not disposable, products. This means razors and pens that last years and dishes that can be washed rather than thrown away. Each year Americans discard 2 billion razors and 1.6 billion pens.</p>
        <p>* Buy products with minimal packaging. Look for products that are concentrated, are packaged in bulk or that have refill packets. The amount of packaging per serving for frozen concentrated orange juice is half that used for juice in cartons or jugs. Containers and packaging make up one-third of the waste stream.</p>
        <p>* Compost yard and food wastes that account for one-quarter of the waste stream. Composting reduces waste collection and disposal costs and generates mulch that will help your garden grow.</p>
        <p>* Choose nontoxic substitutes for products with toxic constituents, e.g., making cleaning solutions from baking soda instead of using commercial rug and upholstery cleaners.</p>
        <p>* Evaluate your habits with an eye to environmental impact. For example, writing on both sides of the page will halve your paper consumption as well as its ultimate waste.</p>
        <p>Americans now generate more garbage than citizens of any other industrialized country - more than three pounds a person a day - and the rate is rising. In addition to improving our management of waste, we need to learn how to generate less waste in the first place.</p>
