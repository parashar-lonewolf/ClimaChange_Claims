        <p>Earth's fascination with neighboring planet Mars has sparked imagination of many artists, writers and scientists throughout centuries; early morning on August 27, Mars and planet Earth will be closer together than they have been in almost 60,000 years; Mars will be more luminous than either Jupiter or Sirius and will show reddish features able to be seen without aid of telescope or binoculars; Sky &amp; Telescope Magazine suggests close proximity of Mars will fire public's imagination, but scientifically much more is to be learned from two Mars probes due to land in January, and not close-up view; once in lifetime event does offer public chance for amazing sight; graphs, photos (M)</p>

        <p>Martians aren't what they used to be. If they were, anxiety might be running high just now over traffic patterns in the solar system.</p>
        <p>Astronomers are spreading the word that the orbits of Mars and Earth are drawing unusually close together. No, the two planets are not about to collide. But they are about to move closer than they have been at any time in almost 60,000 years, back when Neanderthals still had Europe to themselves and anatomically modern Homo sapiens remained mostly in Africa.</p>
        <p>Time was, such a close approach by Mars might have incited panic. Before science reduced Martians to metaphor or at best some undiscovered frostproof microbes or fossils, they were the next-door extraterrestrials most likely to scare people out of their wits.</p>
        <p>One evening in 1938, when Hitler should have been menace enough for a jittery world, radios crackled with news of the most frightful kind. Invading Martians had landed in New Jersey, firing ray guns and releasing clouds of poisonous smoke. It was only a radio play, science fiction, but for a while listeners teetered on the brink of mass hysteria.</p>
        <p>But no invasion alarms ring this time, no prophets walk the streets proclaiming the end is nigh. Martians have dropped to the bottom of humanity's list of clear and present dangers, well below crippling blackouts and terrestrial terrorists. If any reassurances have been needed, they come from astronomers with instructions on when, where and how to enjoy the spectacle of two ships of nature passing in the night.</p>
        <p>Minutes before 6 a.m. Eastern time on Aug. 27, 5:51 to be exact, the separation between Mars and Earth will be precisely 34,646,418 miles. That is proximity only by cosmic standards. Mars was about five times that distance from Earth only six months ago.</p>
        <p>Already, Mars is a sight not to be missed. The planet rises in the southeastern sky progressively earlier each night now through September, and is usually visible in the constellation Aquarius after 9 or 10 p.m. local time. It then climbs higher through the night, shifting more to the south.</p>
        <p>Looming ever larger and redder in the last few weeks, Mars is now more luminous than Jupiter or Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky. Only Venus and the Moon outshine the approaching Mars.</p>
        <p>''You'll know it's Mars, big and reddish and clear as it can be to the naked eye, even better with binoculars or any kind of small telescope,'' said Dr. Myles Standish, an astronomer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.</p>
        <p>Without some magnification, it will not be possible to detect detail of the Martian landscape. Amateur astronomers with backyard telescopes are able to observe mountains and broad desert basins of the planet. The southern polar ice cap is putting on the most dynamic show.</p>
        <p>It is late spring in the planet's southern hemisphere, which is tipped in the direction of Earth. The extensive covering of polar ice, mostly frozen carbon dioxide, stands out brightly in the reflected sunlight, the same warming light that is steadily melting the ice. By the onset of the southern summer on Mars, on Sept. 29, NASA planetary scientists predict, much of the polar cap will be gone.</p>
        <p>Though Mars is only about half the diameter of Earth, the first observations of its polar ice, along with four seasons and a roughly 24-hour day, contributed to the early human fascination with this planetary neighbor. Astronomers began to see it as a world most like Earth. In the 18th century, the astronomer William Herschel felt justified in concluding that the inhabitants of Mars ''probably enjoy a situation in many respects similar to our own.''</p>
        <p>One concern of observers for the weeks ahead is dust. When Mars comes closest to the Sun, as it is now, warming temperatures can stir wind storms, obscuring much of the surface in dust. So observers are encouraged to get their eyeful now, before summertime in the Martian south.</p>
        <p>Sky &amp; Telescope magazine has ventured that the Mars close approach ''is almost a certainty to fire the public's imagination,'' much as did the return of Halley's comet in 1986. Planetariums have issued advisories for observers, and some have scheduled Mars-gazing parties. The Hubble Space Telescope is scheduled to take a portrait of Mars when it draws near.</p>
        <p>But the rare event is less about science and more of an invitation to look and contemplate how far away is neighbor Mars, even in its nearness, and how close and substantive is Mars compared to the many planets now being discovered around other stars like the Sun.</p>
        <p>''Scientifically, is there more we can learn about Mars from close approach?'' Dr. Michael Shara, an astrophysicist at the Hayden Planetarium in New York City, asked rhetorically. ''Of course not. It is a gorgeous sight. Look at it and enjoy. See the poles of Mars. But the heavy-duty science is going to come mostly from probes now on their way to Mars.''</p>
        <p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration launched two spacecraft this summer to land on Mars in January. The European Space Agency has sent a spacecraft bearing a lander for arrival in December. Two American spacecraft from earlier missions are still orbiting the planet and returning data and pictures.</p>
        <p>Computers have refined the ability to calculate the close encounters and extrapolate their occurrences forward and backward in time. Dr. Standish, whose principal job at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory is knowing where planets are for planning and navigating missions, said the calculations start by entering in computers all the forces, mainly gravity, governing the motions of planets.</p>
        <p>''Earth is on a racetrack that is inside the track Mars goes around, and neither track is perfectly circular,'' Dr. Standish said.''There is one place where the two racetracks are closest together. When Earth and Mars are at that place simultaneously, it is an unusually close approach for the two.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Aldo Vitagliano, of the University of Naples, is credited with writing the computer program used for readily determining the orbits and distances of Mars and Earth. Dr. Jean Meeus, a Belgian scientist and author of a book on astronomical formulas, is thought to be the first to recognize that the last time the two planets came as close as this month was 59,619 years ago. The wait for the next time will not be so long -- only 284 years, and then Mars and Earth will cruise even closer. Still, there should be no cause for alarm for people on Earth or, perhaps by then, on Mars itself.</p>
