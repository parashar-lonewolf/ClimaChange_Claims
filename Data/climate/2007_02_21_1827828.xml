        <p>AN INDUSTRY'S PROBLEMS PERSIST -- More than two decades after a Senate investigation revealed widespread problems with itinerant sales, the industry remains almost entirely unregulated. [Page A1.]</p>
        <p>JURY AWARD IS OVERTURNED -- In a victory for corporate defendants, the Supreme Court overturned an Oregon jury's award of $79.5 million in punitive damages against Philip Morris. [A14.]</p>
        <p>LESS MONEY FOR THE ARTS -- Corporate philanthropy dedicated to the arts has dropped by more than half in the last decade, but arts groups are adjusting. [E1.]</p>
        <p>MERCK ENDS VACCINE LOBBYING -- Merck will stop lobbying state legislatures to make the use of its new cervical cancer vaccine mandatory, citing a national controversy over the move. [C1.]</p>
        <p>PROFIT FALLS AT HOME DEPOT Home Depot's fourth-quarter results show just how much work is ahead for Frank Blake, left, the company's new chief executive. The giant home improvement company said its profit fell by 28 percent. [C3.]</p>
        <p>BUT WALL ST. ADVANCES -- The Dow Jones industrials set another closing high as a drop in oil prices helped counter disappointment in Home Depot's results. [C10.]</p>
        <p>MUSICAL CUBICLES AT EBAY -- They're swapping cubicles at eBay and switching to the Internet calling service Skype, which eBay acquired for $2.6 billion in 2005. [C1.]</p>
        <p>A CORPORATE HEALTH CARE SWITCH -- Some employers are no longer pushing employees to pay more for health care because they are convinced that their pennywise approach does not always reduce long-term costs. In one radical move, a number of employers are now giving away drugs to help workers manage chronic conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma and depression. [C1.]</p>
        <p>A GLOBAL WARMING DEBATE -- Professors square off on the issue of global warming. Economix: David Leonhardt. [C1]</p>
        <p>WEIGHING A MERGER'S CHANCES -- The proposed Sirius-XM merger wouldn't have passed muster a decade ago. But times have changed. [C3.]</p>
        <p>A COAL-BURNING DILEMMA -- Experts are casting doubt on two methods to trap carbon in the coal burning process. [C1.]</p>
        <p>BARON OF REAL ESTATE -- Harry Macklowe had to give up several properties, including his prized Hotel Macklowe in the 1990s. But now, he and other New York investors are enjoying a commercial real estate boom. [C6.]</p>
        <p>LABS RETURN TO THE CITY -- A $400 million development that will be New York City's first substantial campus for the life sciences, called the East River Science Park, will break ground in March. Tenants should move in sometime in 2009. [C7.]</p>
        <p>GETTING YOUR MTV -- Viacom reaches a deal with Joost to distribute video online, including MTV's ''The Real World'' and ''Laguna Beach.'' [C8.]</p>
        <p>MEETING ON AIRBUS -- The leaders of Germany and France will meet this week to try to resolve the latest eruption of tensions at Airbus, which is seeking to restore its financial health and better compete with Boeing, its American rival. [C2.]</p>
        <p>FIGHTING GREENHOUSE GAS -- European Union ministers are pledging to raise their own targets if industrialized countries like the United States make similar efforts. [C5.]</p>

        <p>VOLKSWAGEN '06 PROFIT DOUBLES -- Volkswagen's profit for 2006 more than doubled, with a gain on the sale of a car rental business helping to offset steep costs related to a revamping that included thousands of job cuts. VW said sales rose 11 percent and that its results were helped by the sale last March of Europcar, the Continent's largest car rental company. [C2.]</p>
        <p>A FLUORESCENT AUSTRALIA -- Australia plans to phase out incandescent light bulbs by 2010 to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. [C5.]</p>
        <p>THE DOCUMENTARY AS ADVERTISING -- Businesses are blending advertising with entertainment in new documentaries, like the 58-minute film showing this evening in New York that softly markets a blockbuster drug. [C8.]</p>
        <p>ONLINE</p>
        <p>HOLDING THE BAG -- A franchise in a popular restaurant chain can be profitable. But when food-borne illness strikes, it can be financially risky. A special section on small business is at nytimes.com/business.</p>
        <p>SURVIVING TAX TIME -- Getting through an audit, how the Internal Revenue Service deducts deductions, tips on pleasing Uncle Sam and more. A special section on taxes is at nytimes.com/business.</p>
        <p>TOYOTA'S FUTURE LEADERS -- As part of its strategy to hold onto its No. 1 global spot, Toyota has opened a technical high school to train future factory leaders. A slide show is at nytimes.com/multimedia.</p>
