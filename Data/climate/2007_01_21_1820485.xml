        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Amber Fields of Bland'' (Op-Ed, Jan. 14):</p>
        <p>Dan Barber is correct: farmers don't determine what or how they farm. Washington does through policies that favor commodities over a diverse, edible agriculture.</p>
        <p>But I disagree on one point: it's not food that lawmakers are focused on in the new farm bill; it's energy.</p>
        <p>Agriculture and energy policy are merging, and the interests of corn-producing states and multinational agribusinesses are in growing corn for ethanol, oceans of it.</p>
        <p>As demand for ethanol uses up more of the crop, corn prices are at a 10-year high, while global supply is at a 29-year low. The result: higher food costs, more corn for fuel and less for food.</p>
        <p>With this kind of incentive, it's unlikely that farmers are going to choose tasty broccoli over bland corn.</p>
        <p>Jan Weber  Brooklyn, Jan. 15, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Sure, we can buy ''cheap'' hamburgers ground from animals raised in inhumane conditions in government-subsidized factories, fed on subsidized grain, grown with subsidized irrigation.</p>
        <p>As Dan Barber points out, we are paying for it with our tax dollars while sacrificing flavor, local business, healthy soils and diversity.</p>
        <p>He did not mention the alarming and growing health costs of obesity, directly traceable to ''cheap'' calories produced by bloated factory farms.</p>
        <p>How much foreign oil would we save by eating locally grown foods? How much would we influence global climate change by not trucking carrots cross-country?</p>
        <p>This is not only tasteless food that government policies offer us; it is also very expensive.</p>
        <p>Martine Donofrio  Short Hills, N.J., Jan. 14, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Kudos to Dan Barber for caring about what Americans eat rather than about the bottom line of corporations, which have undue political influence.</p>
        <p>One item he doesn't mention is the introduction of cheap high-fructose corn syrup into the American diet and its consequent contribution toward obesity.</p>
        <p>Let's keep taste on the table and maintain the health of our diet and irreplaceable farmland with a more sensible farm bill.</p>
        <p>Elizabeth R. Cardman  Urbana, Ill., Jan. 16, 2007</p>
