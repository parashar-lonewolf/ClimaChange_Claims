        <p>Jason Lawson had a big pickup, but like a growing number of Americans he recently traded up to an even bigger one.</p>
        <p>''It's an S.U.V. with an open back,'' Mr. Lawson, 33, said of his metallic gray Ford F-250 Crew Cab. The pickup weighs about three tons, empty, and has enough room in the cab for him, his wife, their two children in car seats and even the family's chocolate lab.</p>
        <p>''You can use it for work, go home, put the family in it and take off,'' said Mr. Lawson, who lives in a Chicago suburb and owns a flooring company.</p>
        <p>Sales of the largest pickups have been soaring for several years. But in coming months the competition for customers will grow sharply. Japanese automakers are rushing into the market, now one of the most profitable and always dominated by America's Big Three. Ford is introducing a lavishly redesigned version of its best-selling large pickup. Even Hyundai, the Korean company known for low-cost cars, may enter the large-pickup market.</p>
        <p>The trend toward bigger-than-ever pickups has broad implications for the safety of American drivers, the environment, oil consumption and the financial health of the auto industry.</p>
        <p>Big pickups, which can cost $40,000 and up, are the most dangerous vehicles on the road for people riding in other vehicles -- much more dangerous than large sport utility vehicles, according to federal crash statistics. The average pickup uses more gasoline than the average S.U.V. and therefore produces more gases that contribute to global warming. Pickups, along with sport utilities, are also the industry's most profitable vehicles, and they get more profitable as they get larger and more luxurious.</p>
        <p>Once utilitarian vehicles used exclusively for work, pickup trucks are getting bigger, roomier, more powerful and showier in almost every way. Passenger cabs with two rows of seats, once a minority, are the norm.</p>
        <p>The biggest pickups, which were just 8.6 percent of the nation's new vehicles in 1990, now account for 13.2 percent -- about one in every eight vehicles sold.</p>
        <p>The allure of the pickup market for the auto industry is clear. The industry sold two to two and a half times as many full-size pickups as it did full-size S.U.V.'s last year.</p>
        <p>Last year, the Ford F-Series, the best-selling vehicle of any kind in the nation, contributed $2.4 billion of net income to the Ford Motor Company, according to John Casesa, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. Without the truck, the company's $980 million net loss would have been much worse.</p>
        <p>This fall, Ford will start selling redesigned versions of its F-Series including several that seem fancier than its Lincoln luxury sedans. ''It could easily account for all of the company's earnings in 2004,'' Mr. Casesa said.</p>
        <p>Toyota is the only foreign carmaker that sells a full-size pickup, the Tundra. When sales were booming in 2001, it sold more than 100,000 Tundras, compared with Ford's sales of more than 900,000 F-Series trucks. General Motors sold more than 700,000 Chevrolet Silverados, the second-best-selling vehicle in the country, and more than 200,000 GMC Sierras, while Dodge, a unit of Daimler-Chrysler, sold close to 350,000 Ram pickups.</p>
        <p>G.M.'s offerings range from the very large, like its Silverado, to the very fancy, like its Cadillac Escalade EXP pickup. This year, the company will even start selling a luxury pickup with a convertible top, the Chevrolet SSR, that starts above $40,000.</p>
        <p>With luxury pickups increasing in popularity and profitability, however, Japan wants a bigger slice. Nissan is introducing its first full-size pickup, the voluminous Titan, this year. Tellingly, the company will not even offer a regular cab version of the truck -- the basic two-seater that dominated the market a decade ago.</p>
        <p>Toyota will start selling a version of its Tundra in November that has a crew cab -- the largest cab style, much like a big S.U.V. inside. Toyota also recently announced that it would build a new pickup plant in San Antonio, in the heart of pickup country.</p>
        <p>Like their American rivals, Japanese companies are focusing on the many people who only get their hands dirty during the occasional visit to the gardening center -- those who want a pickup with two rows of seats (leather, heated seats) as well as power windows and doors and wood-grained interiors. The biggest pickups are particularly popular in the Southwest and Rocky Mountain states.</p>
        <p>Mike Cruz-Montes, 31, a supervisor at an electric utility who lives in Katy, Tex., about 30 miles west of downtown Houston, has a Ford F-150 extended-cab pickup with a second row of seats, but he is preparing to trade up to a roomier crew cab, which can better accommodate his wife and two daughters.</p>
        <p>''Before, trucks were mainly thought of as for a working man or woman,'' he said. ''I love the power it has when you need it. I do a lot of landscaping around the house and I love to be able to throw things in the back of the truck, mulch or dirt, bring it home, then wash it down and take the kids to dinner. It's very versatile.''</p>
        <p>To environmental and safety advocates, the extension of the auto arms race from sport utilities to pickup trucks is a worrisome development.</p>
        <p>When the average large pickup truck collides with a second vehicle, people in the second vehicle die at a rate of 293 for every 100,000 crashes, according to federal crash statistics. By comparison, large sport utility vehicles kill people in the second vehicle at a rate of 205 per 100,000 crashes; minivans kill at a rate of 104 deaths; and large cars at a rate of 85 deaths.</p>
        <p>''This is terrible for people on the highway,'' said Joan Claybrook, the former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the president of Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group. ''The growth of these larger vehicles, in terms of market share, means the chances you're going to be hit by a big pickup truck goes up, and they are the most dangerous vehicles that can hit your car.''</p>
        <p>Because they roll over more easily than cars, pickup trucks also have fatality rates for their own occupants that are slightly higher than those of passenger cars, but below those of sport utility vehicles, according to the most recent data from the traffic safety agency.</p>
        <p>''If you get super heavy and super large,'' said Brian O'Neill, president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, ''you won't gain many benefits for yourself and you'll inflict more damage on others.''</p>
        <p>Big pickups tend to be safer for their own occupants than small pickups, but when used as family vehicles they are less safe than minivans and station wagons.</p>
        <p>Why are big pickups more dangerous to other drivers than big sport utilities?</p>
        <p>No one really knows; a comprehensive analysis has not been conducted, Mr. O'Neill said. ''Part of that is design and part is where and how they're operated,'' he guessed.</p>
        <p>The higher ground clearance of pickups means that in a crash they can run over the bumper or floor of a car, making them deadlier to passengers in the other vehicle. Big pickups and sport utilities are both built on frame rails that run under the vehicle almost like giant fork tines. The stiff rails can puncture cars or small S.U.V.'s, which are constructed more like steel egg cartons. But pickups can also be carrying heavy loads in their beds, Mr. O'Neill said, and thus they are often heavier in collisions than are the S.U.V.'s that are based on the same frame.</p>
        <p>Also, many pickups are driven in rural areas, where crash speeds tend to be higher.</p>
        <p>Automakers, under pressure from the traffic safety agency, did agree this year to start working together to make S.U.V.'s and pickups less dangerous to other vehicles; consumer groups say the automakers have a poor history of self-regulation.</p>
        <p>Pickup drivers as a group tend to be less careful than people behind the wheels of cars, according to insurance industry data. They tend to drink more and use their seat belts less often, figures show.</p>
        <p>Pickups also weigh more than sport utilities. The average unloaded pickup now weighs about 4,700 pounds, up from about 3,500 pounds in the mid-1980's, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. That's almost 200 pounds more than the average S.U.V. Many versions of the best-selling pickups weigh in at more than three tons, unloaded, putting them in Hummer territory.</p>
        <p>Fuel efficiency of the average pickup has also declined from as high as 19.2 miles a gallon in the 1987 model year to 16.8 miles a gallon today. The average S.U.V. gets 17.8 miles a gallon now and the average car 24.8. And even those averages do not count the very biggest vehicles -- those weighing more than 8,500 pounds fully loaded -- which are exempt under federal law. Like the Hummer and other giant sport utilities, the biggest pickups average little more than 10 miles a gallon.</p>
        <p>And more gas burned means more gases spit out the exhaust pipe. Over its projected life span, the average pickup truck under 8,500 pounds emits 97.9 tons of global warming gases, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental group. The average for S.U.V.'s is 93.4 tons and for cars 66.5 tons.</p>
        <p>At the beginning of the 1990's, people bought full-size and compact pickups at about the same pace, and each kind of truck had roughly 8 percent of the total market for passenger vehicles. Today, full-size pickups have grown to 13 to 14 percent of total passenger vehicle sales, while sales of compact pickups have shrunk to less than 5 percent of the market. Large sport utilities account for 5.8 percent of all sales.</p>
        <p>Full-size pickups themselves are also getting larger. Those with regular cabs, which are the basic work trucks with seating for two, now represent less than 17 percent of full-size truck sales. Extended-cab pickups -- and roomier crew cabs, with seating for five -- accounted for most of the market.</p>
        <p>A decade ago, regular cabs effectively were the market, commanding roughly 80 percent of full-size sales, according to AutoPacific, a market research group.</p>
        <p>''The whole cab mix, industrywide, has flip-flopped,'' said Doug Scott, Ford's marketing director.</p>
        <p>Mark Hogan, G.M. group vice president for advanced vehicle development, said, ''It tells us clearly people aren't using pickups the way they had in the past.''</p>
        <p>Ford has been changing its marketing accordingly. In a recent TV ad, a suburbanite ordering coffee at a truck stop is asked by a trucker if he has his ''rig loaded down.''</p>
        <p>''We're loaded down all right,'' the suburbanite replies, before returning to his F-150, where he hands his wife a cup of coffee while his three daughters argue in the spacious back seat.</p>
        <p>Attracting the suburbanite trucker, of course, means coupling the pickup's tough outside with a gentler inside. The new Lariat version of the Ford F-150, which has a base price of more than $35,000, has leather seats, chrome and brushed steel flourishes, and color schemes with names like ''medium pebble.'' The gear shift is between the seats, like a car's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cruz-Montes said he had long been a truck guy. ''My father had an 85 F-150. It was great for working and hauling things around,'' he said. ''But using that foldout bench they used to have'' -- instead of a second row of seats -- ''for kids it was O.K., but even for a small adult, it was very uncomfortable. They have metamorphosed tremendously toward the family.''</p>
