        <p>Refrigerators and freezers have changed little in their basic design in decades. Shoppers have grown to expect them to be exceptionally durable and trouble free. Instead manufacturers have competed on the basis of new features like through-the-door ice water and special storage bins.</p>
        <p>But now refrigerator makers, pressed by Government mandates to become more energy efficient and by environmental interests to eliminate a family of chemicals essential to proper operation, are being forced into a situation they loathe: rapid technological change.</p>
        <p>The result, at least in the short term, may be appliances that are more environmentally sound but also less durable, bulkier and more expensive than the ones on the market now.</p>
        <p>Manufacturers have long since debugged refrigerators as they are currently designed, and the typical refrigerator operates for 15 years without any maintenance.</p>
        <p>All major manufacturers use the same chemical, chlorofluorocarbon 12, as a refrigerant, because it is efficient and long lasting. CFC 12, moving through a maze of tubes as a vapor, absorbs heat from the refrigerator. A compressor condenses the vapor, making it hotter than the exterior air, to which the heat then flows.</p>
        <p>Similarly, manufacturers all use chlorofluorocarbon 11 as the agent that puffs up the plastic foam that insulates the refrigerator's walls and provides much of the structural support of the box, because it is a good insulator.</p>
        <p>But the chemicals, commonly called CFC's, have been identified as the culprits in thinning the earth's protective ozone layer. By international agreement, their manufacture is to stop by the year 2000. President Bush has called for a halt to their use by the end of 1995.</p>
        <p>As a result the companies that make refrigerators and freezers -- and their suppliers -- are scrambling to come up with substitutes.</p>
        <p>The five biggest refrigerator and freezer makers in the United States market are General Electric, Whirlpool, A.B. Electrolux of Sweden (maker of Frigidaire), Maytag (maker of Admiral) and Raytheon (maker of Amana). Suppliers include large chemical companies like Du Pont, ICI Americas and Allied-Signal.</p>
        <p>Apparently the leading candidate for a substitute for CFC 12 is hydrofluorocarbon 134a. It has no effect on the ozone layer and is being praised by Du Pont and other chemical suppliers as the ideal replacement for CFC 12 as a refrigerant.</p>
        <p>But engineers worry about introducing a new substance into the heart of the operating mechanism without time for extensive testing.</p>
        <p>"By 1995 we will have 50 years of experience with CFC 12," said Carl Offutt, general manager for refrigerator engineering at the Whirlpool Corporation. "We will have less than five years with 134a."</p>
        <p>Mr. Offutt said it remains unclear whether lubricants can be developed that will be compatible with the new refrigerant and keep internal parts working smoothly for decades. And engineers at Whirlpool worry that the new fluid will gradually corrode tubing and components, possibly prompting massive recalls.</p>
        <p>"If the product has problems after we have been building it for two or three years, it could mean bankruptcy," Mr. Offutt said. While a recall would probably not bankrupt a company like Whirlpool, Mr. Offutt's dramatic comment is an indication of the state of mind of engineers whose careers are on the line.</p>
        <p>The nightmare of a recall actually happened to the General Electric Company's appliance division in the mid-1980's. The company introduced a new type of refrigerator compressor, a device that is central to the cooling apparatus, without conducting extended field testing. When the compressors started failing under heavy use, General Electric mounted a costly recall campaign that produced a $450 million pre-tax charge in 1988.</p>
        <p>"It takes five years to get a new compressor from the drawing board to market," said Leonard Swatkowski, a vice president of the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, the major industry trade group, based in Chicago. "G.E. tried to do it in three and a half and they recalled a lot of boxes."</p>
        <p>While a $60 billion company like G.E. could absorb the financial blow, such an error could be a bigger problem for a smaller company.</p>
        <p>Similar durability problems are involved in replacing CFC 11 in the insulation. Most of the proposed substitutes, such as hydrochlorofluorocarbon 141, are less effective insulators than CFC 11, and have a tendency to corrode the plastic interior of the refrigerator.</p>
        <p>"There are compatibility problems with current plastics," said Richard Merriam, a consultant with Arthur D. Little in Cambridge, Mass. "The solution is different plastics."</p>
        <p>But new plastics must be tested for long-term compatibility with insulating foam that includes chemicals like HCFC 141 instead of CFC 11. With the CFC elimination deadline little more than three years away, manufacturers have to cram tests intended to simulate 20 years of use into just a few years.</p>
        <p>"You are never 100 percent sure" about durability testing, Mr. Swatkowski said. "The manufacturers are scared something will pop up."</p>
        <p>Even as design engineers struggle with less efficient refrigerants and insulators, the Government is requiring that appliances operate more efficiently.</p>
        <p>As of next Jan. 1, an 18 cubic-foot refrigerator will be permitted to consume no more than 690 kilowatt hours of power per year, down from 955 kilowatts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Swatkowski said the new Federal standard means refrigerators will have to average electricity consumption no greater than that of a continuously operating 75-watt lightbulb.</p>
        <p>The standards are to be tightened again in 1998, although the specific requirements have not yet been decided. Because refrigerators and freezers are on all the time, they use as much as 20 percent of some households' electricity.</p>
        <p>Refrigerator engineers note that even technical approaches that look promising in a laboratory are a long way from mass commercial use.</p>
        <p>The designers say they are struggling to avoid thickening the walls of the appliances to increase their insulating ability. The main reason is that there is little or no extra space in most kitchens for a larger refrigerator.</p>
        <p>"We don't want the door to hit the cabinet on the other side of the kitchen," said Alan Kessler, vice president for engineering at Amana.</p>
        <p>Mr. Merriam of A. D. Little said the manufacturers have a little leeway to increase outside dimensions. "Most people have space on top, so they could get a little taller," he said. "And they could stick out a little more in front. There are some things they can do that are not as apparent to the customer." But a larger, thicker-walled refrigerator would probably be heavier and harder to move.</p>
        <p>Decreasing the interior volume, to keep the outside the same size, is no solution, the engineers say. The energy rules are based on interior volume, so if it is reduced, less electrical consumption is allowed.</p>
        <p>Those refrigeration industry executives willing to talk about the future of their products say they are concerned that in meeting energy and CFC requirements, they may turn off customers.</p>
        <p>"Our marketing people are saying that with all the time and money we are spending on technical specifications, we are putting customer satisfaction at risk," Mr. Offutt of Whirlpool said.</p>
        <p>Larger, thicker-walled refrigerators at higher prices with no additional features may seem unattractive, they fear, despite the savings on energy costs and the environmental benefits.</p>
        <p>Because each manufacturer is working on its own solution to the CFC and energy efficiency problems, executives of the companies are reluctant to discuss the approaches they are taking. Mr. Swatkowksi of the trade association said it appeared that a number of methods are being developed, leading to more diversified lines of products.</p>
        <p>"Refrigerators will not be as much a commodity," he said.</p>
        <p>Noting that HCFC's also attack the ozone layer, although at a lesser rate than CFC's, some environmental groups have suggested using completely different refrigerants, like ammonia or propane. But ammonia is toxic and propane is flammable, so the betting in the industry is that they will not be used.</p>
        <p>In the end, the differences between products may be relatively minor, because suppliers of refrigerants and components, like compressors, will push hard to have just a few common types. This simplifies manufacturing and makes later servicing less complex. It also helps to hold down prices.</p>
        <p>During the 1990's most refrigerators will have cooling systems similar to those in use now, but with HFC 134a as the refrigerant, said Helen Connon, a refrigeration specialist at Du Pont. "Three decades from now I would not be as sure," she said. "A lot of technology is being researched, but it will not be ready by the end of the decade."</p>
        <p>Despite the technical difficulties, most refrigerator makers say they will be able to meet foreseeable energy standards and eliminate the CFC's. But sticker prices, which generally range from under $500 to more than $2,000 for a standard-size refrigerator, will probably rise.</p>
        <p>Mr. Merriam said he thinks the increases will be modest, if only because of the highly competitive nature of the appliance business. "They can probably reach SERP levels for an additional $15 to $50. We're not talking another $1,000 here."  BEATING THE STANDARDS</p>
        <p>A group of electric utilities, including Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, is offering a $30 million award to the first manufacturer that can develop CFC-free refrigerators that beat the 1993 Federal standards by at least 25 percent. Bids are due in October and two prototypes are scheduled to be built by next June.</p>
        <p>None of the manufacturers contacted would say whether they plan to submit a bid or comment on the offer in any way.</p>
        <p>"We want to push technology on efficiency and eliminate CFC's," said Richard Harkness, executive director of the Super Efficient Refrigerator Project, or SERP, as the utility undertaking is known. "If they can meet our goals, they probably have a refrigerator close to the 1998 standards."</p>
        <p>Mr. Harkness said a wide variety of technologies are available to increase the efficiency of refrigerators without using CFC's. Better insulating materials is an example. "Current insulation has R values ranging from 4 to 7," he said, using a scale that measures resistance to heat transmission. "But there are ways of getting R values between 20 and 50, so there are major gains to be made in insulation."</p>
        <p>"Smarter" refrigerators can help as well. In frost-free models, which constitute about 95 percent of those sold in this country, a timer regularly activates heating coils that melt the accumulated frost. But then the cooling unit must consume power to re-chill the interior.</p>
        <p>"Most refrigerators automatically defrost two times a day," Mr. Harkness said. "That may be needed in some parts of the country, but here in California it probably only needs to come on once a month." (Frost tends to build up in hot, humid weather, rather than in a dry climate like California's.) By adding sensors and microprocessor controls, devices could activate the defroster only when needed.</p>
