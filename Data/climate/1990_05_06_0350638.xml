        <p>A GUIDE TO GAIA</p>
        <p>A Survey of the New Science of Our Living Earth.</p>
        <p>By Michael Allaby.</p>
        <p>181 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>E. P. Dutton. $18.95.</p>
        <p>On the heels of the lunar landing 20 years ago came news of acid rain, then ozone depletion, the greenhouse effect and a litany of other depredations people were wreaking upon the planet. The glorious leap into space began to look like a route of escape from a befouled planet. But the ultimate insult to human pretensions about gaining control over nature has been dealt by the proponents of a novel scientific hypothesis called Gaia. These thinkers - physicists, biologists and philosophers, among others - assert that while humans may be capable of causing plenty of havoc, it is the bacteria that are primarily in control of the earth's destiny.</p>
        <p>The Gaians argue that living things, particularly various algae and bacteria, regulate the inert matter of the earth, such as gases and minerals, maintaining a stable, hospitable environment for life in general. The theory grew out of the ruminations of the British scientist James Lovelock over the issue of how to determine whether or not life exists on Mars.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lovelock reasoned that the question could be answered without searching for little green men. The earth's atmosphere is chockablock with gases, such as the oxygen we breathe, that derive originally from the work of living things. The absence of these gases on Mars, Mr. Lovelock inferred, is a sign that life is also absent there. Mr. Lovelock then went on to argue that because atmospheric composition determines phenomena like climate, living things, to a very large degree, write the conditions of their own contract with the universe.</p>
        <p>In ''A Guide to Gaia,'' Michael Allaby, an editor and a journalist who wrote an earlier book with Mr. Lovelock, has laid out this argument in an accessible fashion. Unfortunately, Mr. Lovelock's absence as a co-author from the current work may have contributed to the omissions, overstatements and outright scientific errors that cause this volume to go seriously awry.</p>
        <p>The notion that life influences the nonliving framework in which it subsists is now well accepted, and an entire new field of research, biogeochemistry, is devoted to elaborating this complex web of interactions. But Mr. Allaby, like many other proponents of Gaia, goes one step further. He proposes that living things act as a single, coordinated entity that maintains the earth's temperature and other vital signs within very narrow limits that are to the entity's own benefit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Allaby gives none of the detail of the fascinating scientific debate that has raged over this formulation; he ignores the problems its proponents have encountered in proving their case. Even the terms of the debate are subject to contention. While the earth's temperature has remained within a range of about 25 degrees Fahrenheit for hundreds of millions of years, this time span has included periods when much of North America was buried under a mile of ice. Is the 25-degree range, in fact, narrow? And from whose point of view? After all, conditions that are stable for bacteria may spell chaos for humans. The Gaia entity cannot be counted on to rescue us from global warming.</p>
        <p>By the end of the book, Mr. Allaby has become so blinded by his enthusiasm for Gaia that he throws fact to the wind. Most acid rain in North America is not due to algal emissions, as the author asserts, but arises from industrial sources. Most of the ozone-destroying chlorine in the atmosphere likewise has an industrial, not a biological, origin. Mr. Allaby spends too much effort debunking Gaian religious speculations, and not nearly enough purveying the flavor of a genuine scientific controversy.</p>
