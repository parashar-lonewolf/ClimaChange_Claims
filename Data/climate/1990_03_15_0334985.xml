        <p>LEAD: THE job is not quick and dirty. It is slow and dirty. And the time line is not measured in years or even decades. For landscape architects and designers, the task of turning garbage into gardens - reclaiming landfills - means transforming a toxic mass into a livable place over time.</p>
        <p>THE job is not quick and dirty. It is slow and dirty. And the time line is not measured in years or even decades. For landscape architects and designers, the task of turning garbage into gardens - reclaiming landfills - means transforming a toxic mass into a livable place over time.</p>
        <p>As landfills close, landscape architects have begun to redesign these rubble-strewn deserts as more than monuments to a throwaway society. With open space shrinking, and esthetic and environmental consciousness expanding, communities want to rescue landscapes that are seeping toxic gases and swarming with hobo seagulls.</p>
        <p>This desire has attracted a more visual stewardship. On Staten Island, in Palm Beach County, Fla., and in Phoenix, public officials and engineers have drafted architects, designers and artists to restore and socialize derelict sites.</p>
        <p>Their plans for passive parks, nature trails, education centers and playing fields sound like wish lists. But the use of designers to create amenities like pedestrian paths, schools to teach natural recycling and hills providing urban panoramas, rolling landscapes and wooded areas is at least a sign of respect for the environment and hope for these toxic sites.</p>
        <p>Of all the plans, none is on a grander scale than those of the New York City Department of Sanitation for the 2,500-acre Fresh Kills Landfill on Staten Island, the largest in the country. The landfill, where trucks and barges dump up to 1,000 tons of trash an hour, is to become a preserve for the city's Department of Parks and Recreation.</p>
        <p>The landfill has four mounds, each more than 100 feet high. Under the proposal, the largest will eventually rise 500 feet on 880 acres. Taller than the Washington Monument, it will be the highest hill along the eastern shoreline. The other mounds will rise up to 300 feet.</p>
        <p>The SWA Group, a Boston landscape architecture firm, is working with engineers and the sanitation department's artist, Mierle Ukeles, to produce a preliminary master plan this spring. But the overall cost and time table depend on variables of waste, incineration and recycling.</p>
        <p>''It's not an easy task,'' said Eduardo Santaella, one of the landscape architects charged to turn this poisonous site into a safe and attractive place. The mass moves, he said; methane and carbon dioxide escape. ''It's a monster,'' added William Brown, another SWA architect.</p>
        <p>SCS Engineers of Reston, Va., is working on the means to stabilize the mound and channel the gases into fuel or other uses. The community boards for the surrounding neighborhoods are looking over everyone's shoulders to see how the site will appear after the turn of the century, by which two of the mounds are expected to be closed.</p>
        <p>''We don't want just a dumb mound,'' said Mr. Santaella as he sat with the brightly colored sheets of the land-use study tacked above him on the wall in the firm's Boston office.</p>
        <p>The plans for the major hillock include benching - terracing the slopes into an attractive form to be then shaped by the landfill's accumulating trash - and creating paths and a scenic overlook once the mound is capped and covered with earth.</p>
        <p>The plans for the three smaller mounds at Fresh Kills, which was begun in 1947 on a wetland, go further. The landscape architects are trying to come up with a design for the mounds as they fill, and for the surrounding area of runoff water and swamp that will include amenities like trails, jogging courses and playing fields. Whether shaping the water on the site as a naturalistic, ecological and pleasing form, or grading the slopes and paths, the architects will try to use the same environmental and esthetic skills they would in any other landscape design.</p>
        <p>If such efforts seem distant and cosmetic treatment for a nation looking for instant landscapes and quick detoxification, the landscape architects' procedure has historic precedent. Landscape architects are experienced with plants that demand time to mature and know how to paint a canvas as dynamic and changing as the earth itself.</p>
        <p>Their father figure, after all, is Frederick Law Olmsted, who transformed the wastelands of Central Park in Manhattan and the Fens in Boston into masterworks. Flushing Meadows Corona Park in Queens and the Brooklyn Botanic Garden are the results of similar manipulations of former dumps.</p>
        <p>In Phoenix, a team assembled by Michael Singer, an artist from Wilmington, Vt., is working to beautify the 24-acre Transfer and Recycling Center at 27th Street, which Mr. Singer calls an ''incredibly devastated'' landfill on the outskirts of the city. The $17.2 million center is scheduled to open in late 1991.</p>
        <p>''We're taking a negative and turning it into a positive,'' said Ron Jensen, the director of the Public Works Department in Phoenix.</p>
        <p>The project began with an invitation to Mr. Singer to share in Phoenix's program that sets aside 1 percent of building project budgets for art. But Mr. Singer and Mr. Jensen thought larger and more ecologically than the usual single piece of public art. Mr. Singer and the rest of the team - Linnea Glatt, an artist in Dallas, and Sterling McMurrin, an architect in Biddeford, Me. - ''wanted to influence the esthetic of the entire place,'' Mr. Singer said. They wanted not only to make a functional recycling center but to enhance the environment and educate the public.</p>
        <p>Mr. Singer said he avoids the extremes of ''plop art,'' where a sculpture is placed in an open site often without concern for context, or the more macho earth-moving works of the 60's. He has been involved in placing sculptures along the Grand River in Grand Rapids, Mich., and near the pedestrian path at the canal chain in the Lowell National Urban Park in Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>For the Phoenix project, the art-oriented team has transformed the original design for a boxy recycling center into a more expressive form. It has added a visible truss construction, redesigned an asphalt environment to take advantage of the scenic vista of South Mountain and the city skyline, and added to the educational mission of the waste-disposal program by creating catwalks to view the recycling process. The artists also added a four-acre aerated pond to demonstrate the natural restoring power of water.</p>
        <p>''In the past, it's been out of sight, out of mind,'' said Gretchen Freeman, the public art program coordinator of the Phoenix Arts Council. ''We're really addressing the issue of making people confront their waste. Since this city is building so much infrastructure - parks, street projects, waste facilities - artists have the chance to influence the process.''</p>
        <p>If it is not easy to turn a devastated environment into an acceptable one, environmentalists take a gritty pleasure in the process. ''Talk about making lemon out of lemonade,'' said Linda Hodgkins of the Palm Beach County Solid Waste Authority, which has concerned itself with the esthetics of trash disposal since the mid-80's.</p>
        <p>In one of the authority's more ecologically sensitive programs, George G. Gentile, a landscape architect, has helped the agency prepare a new landfill while restoring an old one. In the last half-dozen years, they have moved 200,000 trees from the new landfill site along the state turnpike in West Palm Beach to a 400-acre closed landfill across the road.</p>
        <p>The transplant process involved collecting grass by hand and scooping out trees. ''We picked up total wetland systems, upland vegetative systems,'' Mr. Gentile said.</p>
        <p>The use of native growths saved the authority money and provided mature trees that were able to survive a recent drought, Mr. Gentile added. The county's program to groom the old dump cost less than $20 million.</p>
        <p>The new landscape manipulators drawn from the design profession want to go beyond cosmetics. They not only want to make sick landscapes useful and attractive, they also recognize the need for a whole earth policy and sound ecology in trash reduction.</p>
        <p>''We're moving into a crisis,'' said Mr. Brown, one of the architects on the Fresh Kills project. ''We want to make something that the community is not going to turn its back to.''</p>
        <p>Poisoned places may not become elegant greenswards, but to those beginning to address the problem, the ugly toad may yet wear a jewel.</p>
