        <p>There was one point in Sunday night's debate when Ross Perot, otherwise sailing along smoothly, was buffeted by both President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton. Mr. Perot was asked about his proposal to raise gasoline taxes 50 cents a gallon over five years. He defended it, then took a double broadside.</p>
        <p>Governor Clinton said the tax would stifle an already stagnant economy. Mr. Bush complained that it would unfairly hit certain families harder than others. These two criticisms seemed to confirm Mr. Perot's earlier fear that a responsible deficit-reduction plan would be subjected to unreasonable pot shots -- a fear that helped drive him from the Presidential race in July.</p>

        <p>There was one point in Sunday night's debate when Ross Perot, otherwise sailing along smoothly, was buffeted by both President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton. Mr. Perot was asked about his proposal to raise gasoline taxes 50 cents a gallon over five years. He defended it, then took a double broadside.</p>
        <p>Governor Clinton said the tax would stifle an already stagnant economy. Mr. Bush complained that it would unfairly hit certain families harder than others. These two criticisms seemed to confirm Mr. Perot's earlier fear that a responsible deficit-reduction plan would be subjected to unreasonable pot shots -- a fear that helped drive him from the Presidential race in July.</p>
        <p>But his idea merits serious debate. Neither of his opponents' objections counts for much. Higher gas taxes need not threaten the economy. He proposes to delay their passage, and could, if required, phase them in slowly.</p>
        <p>Nor are they necessarily unfair if the Perot plan is examined in its totality. Gas taxes do hit middle- and low-income families. But Mr. Perot also proposes tax hikes on the well-to-do: targeted higher income and payroll taxes and caps on deductions for mortgage interest and health-insurance premiums. Besides, research shows that the gas tax hits families up and down the income scale pretty much the same.</p>
        <p>The debate sidestepped other essential facts. Gasoline taxes not only raise money for deficit reduction and infrastructure but also help the environment by cutting demand for fossil fuels. Families and regions that rely heavily on automobiles absorb a shock, but some discomfort is unavoidable if the United States is ever to get a grip on energy use.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the regional impact can be mitigated. Mr. Perot suggests using some of the revenues to create jobs in heavily affected regions.</p>
        <p>The proposal is far from perfect. Many economists wouldn't increase the gasoline tax as much or would tax oil instead. And Mr. Perot's overall program to achieve a zero deficit within five years -- of which the gasoline tax is a part -- is too much, too soon.</p>
        <p>But those errors are remediable. Lost in the back and forth is that Mr. Perot is the only candidate to admit that Americans will have to pay steeply higher taxes if there is to be enough money in the public till to preserve essential services and investments. And he backs this honest prescription with forthright, if not ideal, options.</p>
        <p>Presidential debates provide not only a forum for judging candidates but for illuminating important and complex issues. On the gas tax question, that opportunity was squandered .</p>
