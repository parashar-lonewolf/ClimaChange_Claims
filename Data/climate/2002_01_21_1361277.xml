        <p>As president, Bill Clinton labored to end the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians. Today, he came back here to bask in a warm Israeli welcome, to call on both sides to keep trying, and to place the blame for his peace initiative's failure squarely on Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader.</p>
        <p>''Chairman Arafat missed a golden opportunity,'' Mr. Clinton said in a speech here tonight, ruing Mr. Arafat's rejection of a peace proposal made at Camp David in 2000 and repeatedly demanding that he crack down on attacks on Israelis.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's appeals for Israeli restraint and concessions were more muffled. ''There will not be a military victory,'' he said, in what seemed a reproof to the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, who was in the audience.</p>
        <p>These are lonely days for Mr. Arafat, who is blockaded in his official compound in the West Bank city of  Ramallah by Israeli troops. Though thousands of Palestinians marched in Gaza City today to support him, and others clashed again with the soldiers in Ramallah, Mr. Arafat finds himself increasingly isolated internationally.</p>
        <p>He has been criticized by the United States and other nations over the violence and Palestinian links to arms smuggling.</p>
        <p>[The governor of the West Bank town of Tulkarem, Izzedine Sharif, said on Monday that Israeli tanks had taken control there, marking the largest raid on a Palestinian town in 16 months of fighting, The Associated Press reported. A Palestinian security official said about 100 tanks and armored personnel carriers took part in the raid. Mr. Sharif said dozens of militants were arrested. The Israeli military had no immediate comment.]</p>
        <p>Today, a senior Israeli military official said Palestinian officials around Mr. Arafat had begun to talk among themselves about replacing him. But he said it was unlikely that they would act as long as Mr. Arafat had some international support and continued receiving financial backing from the European Union and Arab states. ''They won't move until they know they are going to be successful,'' he said. ''It's like Julius Caesar and Brutus.''</p>
        <p>Top Palestinian officials insist that loyalty to Mr. Arafat has not wavered, and even the Israeli official marveled at the Palestinian leader's survival skills.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, on a swing through the Middle East, stopped in Israel to collect an honorary doctorate from Tel Aviv University and to bless the university's new Clinton Program for American Studies. He plans to meet on Monday with Israeli and Palestinian officials. But his aides said he would not meet with Mr. Arafat. An official in Mr. Arafat's office still held out hope tonight of a meeting. If Mr. Clinton should care to sit down with Mr. Arafat, the official said, ''he is most welcome.''</p>
        <p>In a 38-minute speech, Mr. Clinton was in familiar form, ranging over favorite subjects like global warming, poverty, gee-whiz technology, and, wistfully, himself. He noted, with obvious emotion, that he departed office a year ago today. Now, he said, ''I have no power, no responsibilities.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Clinton proudly pointed out, he visited Israel more times than any other American president. He is regarded fondly by Israelis, though many think he went too far in his proposals for a settlement. Some cars here still bear a bumper sticker reading, in Hebrew, ''Peace, friend'' -- Mr. Clinton's words of mourning for the assassinated Israeli prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin. Mr. Rabin was killed in 1995 by a Jewish extremist opposed to the peace efforts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton invoked Mr. Rabin's memory as he urged further efforts toward peace. He received standing ovations in a crowded hotel banquet hall here, and his speech was carried live on Israeli television and radio.</p>
        <p>Palestinians also tend to praise Mr. Clinton, particularly in contrast to President Bush, who has refused to shake Mr. Arafat's hand. But Palestinians, as well as some former Clinton officials, challenge the view held by Israelis and Mr. Clinton that the Camp David proposal was a generous offer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said that the proposal still provided ''the outlines of a reasonable settlement.'' But Mr. Sharon  has said he would never offer so much territory to the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>Indeed, speaking before Mr. Clinton, Mr. Sharon praised the man he called ''dear Bill'' as ''a true friend,'' but pointedly referred to Jerusalem as ''our eternal, undivided capital.'' Mr. Clinton, with former Prime Minister Ehud Barak, would have turned some Jerusalem neighborhoods over to the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton urged his audience not to become discouraged. ''There is nothing more I can do,'' he said. ''But I have lived long enough and had enough success as well as enough failure to tell you that you can never get discouraged, and you can never quit. Because you can never know when a chance for a miracle will pass you by.''</p>
