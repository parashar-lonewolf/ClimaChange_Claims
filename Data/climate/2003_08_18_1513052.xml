        <p>A rainy spring and the hotter-than-average summer that followed have helped bring an unexpected distinction to Colorado: the state has the worst outbreak of the West Nile virus in the nation this year, and this small town just north of Denver is at its epicenter.</p>
        <p>''The mosquitoes have gotten a foothold,'' said Cindy Parmenter, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.</p>
        <p>For several years the mosquito-borne West Nile disease has spread along the East Coast and into the South, setting off mild panic in some areas. But it seemed as remote to Colorado as the region of Uganda that gave the disease its name after it was discovered there in 1937.</p>
        <p>That began to change last year when Colorado recorded its first case of West Nile. Here in Weld County alone, 13 people tested positive for West Nile in 2002, and although no people in the state died from the disease more than 30 horses did.</p>
        <p>But this year the weather appears to have set the stage for a much more serious problem.</p>
        <p>''We had a wet, cool June and then a really hot July, with unusually sustained heat, which permitted the mosquitoes to hatch,'' Ms. Parmenter said.</p>
        <p>At least seven deaths have been attributed to West Nile virus in Colorado this year, while only four other fatal cases were reported nationwide. There have also been 388 suspected cases, higher than in any other state and five times as many as in South Dakota, which has recorded the second most cases.</p>
        <p>And officials said the West Nile season has not peaked yet. The high point for infections is expected late this month, after which they will taper off as the weather cools and mosquitoes die.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, state health officials reported the latest death, that of a 69-year-old woman in Weld County who contracted meningitis, a swelling of the membranes around the spinal cord and brain. That day, there were 52 new cases of West Nile in Colorado, the highest number reported in a single day.</p>
        <p>Officials suspect that the actual number of people infected in Colorado might be much higher, since many simply feel sick for a few days and recover without knowing what afflicted them.</p>
        <p>That was the case with Ardis Peterson, 59, of Greeley. At first, the cough scratching at her throat seemed like nothing more than a cold symptom. Then her neck began to feel stiff and a rash appeared on her chest. Most of all, she felt tired. She still did not know what was wrong, but the doctor who examined her did.</p>
        <p>''You have all the symptoms of West Nile virus,'' Ms. Peterson said, recalling the doctor's diagnosis two weeks ago at a clinic here, 50 miles north of Denver.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't frightened,'' she said. ''I knew I wasn't sick enough to be really sick.''</p>
        <p>Colorado's high numbers for West Nile infections may be skewed by the fact that state health officials count even minor cases, while most states list them only if they progress to illnesses like meningitis or encephalitis.</p>
        <p>''We made the decision to tell Coloradans everything,'' Ms. Parmenter said.</p>
        <p>In an effort to stem West Nile, Colorado officials printed 450,000 pamphlets in English and Spanish titled ''Fight the Bite,'' as well as 150,000 posters, with information about how the virus is spread and how to prevent infection.</p>
        <p>The woman whose death was reported last week was the second resident of Weld County to die from an illness associated with the virus this year. More West Nile cases have been reported here in Weld County, 57, than anywhere else in Colorado, although no one has explained why.</p>
        <p>''We're trying to tell the people of Weld County that we're close to a crisis and that they need to do what they can to protect themselves,'' Mike Geile, a county commissioner, said during a visit on Friday to the county's health department laboratory.</p>
        <p>Since Aug. 1, one person has died in Boulder, two in Larimer and two in Pueblo, in addition to the two in Weld County. Elsewhere in the United States this year, two people infected with West Nile have died in Texas and another two in Alabama.</p>
        <p>Before last week, all of the West Nile cases in Colorado were reported to have occurred east of the Continental Divide, which was thought to provide a buffer over which infected mosquitoes could not cross. But on Thursday, officials announced the first case west of the Rocky Mountains, that of a man in Delta County.</p>
        <p>The Web site of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that the West Nile virus can also be transmitted through transplanted organs and transfused blood, although the recent introduction of screening of blood donations should reduce the risk.</p>
        <p>Today, the agency warned doctors and other health workers not to confuse West Nile virus and a milder illness commonly known as viral meningitis that has appeared this summer in outbreaks.</p>
        <p>West Nile virus and viral meningitis can both cause fever, sensitivity to light and a stiff or sore neck. But West Nile virus tends to affect older people, and viral meningitis strikes children or young adults.</p>
        <p>The disease is carried mostly by birds -- crows, ravens, magpies, jays -- that have been bitten by infected mosquitoes. Those birds are bitten by other mosquitoes, which then carry the virus and bite other birds. Once bitten by an infected mosquito, people older than 50 appear to be most vulnerable to the more serious effects of the virus.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mark Wallace, director of the Weld County Department of Public Health and Environment, said his office had embarked on a collaborative control effort with 21 municipalities covering a 350-square-mile area, where most of the county's 210,000 residents live.</p>
        <p>Officials are telling people to use strong insect repellents and to wear trousers and long-sleeved shirts, preferably in light colors, which will show up any mosquitoes that come in for a landing. Residents are also being advised to have good screens on windows and doors and to empty standing water from flower pots, barrels, wading pools and pet dishes.</p>
        <p>''They used to just be annoying,'' Marian Ruge, a spokeswoman for the Health Department, said of the mosquitoes. ''Now they have the potential to be lethal.''</p>
        <p>Because of the outbreak of West Nile, Trevor Jiricek, the director of environmental health services for the department, has had to divert his attention from food and landfill inspections.</p>
        <p>''We're trying to kill the mosquitoes in the larval stage so they don't grow into adults and start feeding on people,'' Mr. Jiricek said. Once the mosquitoes hatch, he said, the best way is to trap them.</p>
        <p>On Friday evening, Mr. Jiricek left his office with a trap and hung it from an ash tree in his back yard. A thermos next to the trap was filled with dry ice that gave off carbon dioxide, attracting mosquitoes by mimicking the exhalation of a human being. Approaching the trap, the insects were drawn to a small light hanging over a fan, which sucked them in and dropped them into a net below. Later, placing the insects in a freezer would finish them off.</p>
        <p>Not everyone here is worried about mosquitoes or the virus some of them carry.</p>
        <p>''I got bitten by more mosquitoes in Vietnam than I can count,'' Ben Eckhardt, 61, said today in his bicycle repair shop downtown. ''Those days, you had to take your salt tablets to stave off malaria. Now we got a mosquito running around here; you've got to take you repellent with you, or you're going to get sick. Maybe I should take up smoking again -- that'll keep them away.''</p>
