        <p>Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen suggested today that the Clinton Administration would propose a tax on all forms of energy to help lower the budget deficit and encourage conservation.</p>

        <p>Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen suggested today that the Clinton Administration would propose a tax on all forms of energy to help lower the budget deficit and encourage conservation.</p>
        <p>In a television interview, Mr. Bentsen, whom President Clinton has made the Administration's chief spokesman on economic matters, also indicated that a tax cut for the middle class was not in the offing. In addition, he did not take issue with a questioner who asserted that an energy tax would fall most heavily on the middle class.</p>
        <p>On the NBC News program "Meet the Press," on which Mr. Bentsen was interviewed, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who is the chairman of the Finance Committee and thus one of the most important voices in Congress on tax legislation, said he would support an energy tax. 'Some Tough Choices'</p>
        <p>Mr. Bentsen's statements amounted to a concession by the new Administration that the only way to bring down the budget deficit is to take the politically difficult steps of raising the taxes of ordinary Americans and cutting Government programs.</p>
        <p>"Some tough choices will have to be made that haven't been faced up to in the past," the Treasury Secretary said. He said that spending reductions would provide a large part of what the Administration hoped to cut from the deficit by 1997.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bentsen seemed to rule out a tax on gasoline alone and spoke of the benefits of a "broad-based" energy tax. Broad-based normally refers to a tax on all forms of energy, including petroleum, natural gas, coal, hydroelectricity and nuclear power. Impact on Many Products</p>
        <p>For a family spending $100 a month in utility bills and $60 for gasoline, a 5 percent increase in fuel costs would total $8 each month. In addition, the prices of many products and services, like air travel, would rise as the higher cost of fuel was passed along to consumers.</p>
        <p>In his campaign, Mr. Clinton had maintained that lowering the deficit could be accomplished rather painlessly by raising the taxes of wealthy individuals and foreign companies and by improving the way Government programs were managed. He promised a tax cut for the middle class.</p>
        <p>But since the election, he has begun to talk of the need for some bitter medicine to get the deficit under control. "It will not be easy," he declared in his Inaugural Address last week. "It will require sacrifice."</p>
        <p>Mr. Bentsen said the main reason for the change in attitude was that the budget deficit in the middle of this decade had been projected to be much higher than was estimated six months ago. That is because the economy is expected to be weaker, the cost of Government medical programs is rising faster than expected and the timetable for spending for the savings and loan bailout has changed.  Falling Behind Schedule</p>
        <p>Other officials who have been working on the economic package said that the deficit-cutting measures offered during the campaign were always insufficient and that the difficulty in reducing the deficit had been underestimated.</p>
        <p>Before the election, Mr. Clinton had promised that he would present an economic plan to Congress on Inauguration Day. Officials now say that the plan will not be ready until the middle of next month and that a complete budget will not be submitted until March.</p>
        <p>"Four years from now or three weeks from now, people are going to judge President Clinton on the effectiveness of his program and not on whether it was presented a few weeks late," Mr. Bentsen said in a brief telephone conversation on Friday.</p>
        <p>On television today, he said that the economics team was working on the matter night and day and that material was sent to him at home as late as 10:30 Saturday night. He noted that Ronald Reagan, the last President to take office determined to turn the Government's economic policies around, did not announce his plans until Feb. 18, 1981, almost a month after his inauguration. Awaiting Political Decisions</p>
        <p>The biggest decisions to be made, officials said, are not so much economic judgments as political ones that can be made only by President Clinton himself. "What it all boils down to is who's going to take the hit," a Presidential adviser said.</p>
        <p>In other words, who is going to end up paying higher taxes? Who is going to have their benefits reduced? Which claimants for new Government money will be rejected? Which politicians will be denied projects for their constituents?</p>
        <p>During the campaign and the transition and his first few days in office, Mr. Clinton has avoided making those judgments, at least publicly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bentsen argued that Americans were willing to pay the price to cut the deficit and strengthen the economy. "The American people are ready for it," he said, "as long as they think those sacrifices are equally shared and the investment is in our future for the increase in the standard of living of our people." 'Our Budget Deficit Now'</p>
        <p>Senator Moynihan said the Democrats in Congress would support unpopular measures. "Look, it is our budget deficit now," he said. "We were partners in creating it. It wasn't our idea, but it's our deficit. And it will paralyze our Administration and our country if we don't get it out of the way."</p>
        <p>As for Republicans, they favor consumption taxes like energy taxes over taxes on income or wealth.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bentsen emphasized that the plan was still being developed. He avoided most questions about its contents and did not say specifically that the Administration favored an energy tax. But the positive way he responded to a question about such a tax left little doubt about where the Administration stood.</p>
        <p>"A broad-based energy tax is certainly one of those that is on the table as an option to be considered, because it does a couple of things," he said. "One, it raises revenue. On the other point, it helps lead to some environmental objectives that we're trying to bring about by conservation of the use of energy. See, at the present time, we're importing almost a billion dollars a week of oil, and that certainly adds to our trade deficit." Emphasis on One Promise</p>
        <p>The imported oil, he went on to say, often comes from "unstable political areas."</p>
        <p>Mr. Bentsen also suggested that the Administration might favor higher taxes on alcohol and tobacco and restated the Clinton campaign pledge for higher income taxes on families with incomes of more than $200,000 a year. He said that if additional deficit spending was proposed for this year to stimulate the economy, the stimulus would be smaller than the $50 billion that some economists have recommended.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore said last week that he supported an energy tax. Energy Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary said in her confirmation hearing that she opposed new energy taxes, but that is probably evidence that she is not a central figure in overall economic policy-making within the Administration.</p>
        <p>Middle-class Americans would bear the brunt of an energy tax because they pay a much larger portion of their incomes for fuel than do the rich. Congress would probably provide some form of rebate for the poor to offset the additional cost of essential fuel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bentsen said a gasoline tax would affect some regions of the country much more severely than others. Senator Moynihan said he agreed with that judgment, even though westerners, who drive longer distances, would be affected much more by a gasoline tax than New Yorkers.</p>
        <p>An energy tax could be based on the cost of fuel consumed, on units produced like barrels of oil or tons of coal or on the heat content as measured by British thermal units. Some economists favor a tax based on carbon dioxide emissions, but that does not seem to be what the Administration has in mind. Energy Tax May Have Support</p>
        <p>A broad-based energy tax could be collected by retailers like power companies or filling stations or it could be imposed at an earlier stage of the distribution process.</p>
        <p>The Congressional Budget Office has calculated that a 5 percent tax on energy consumption would raise $18 billion a year.</p>
        <p>An energy tax might be more politically palatable than other taxes that would raise a similar amount of revenue. All regions of the country would be affected more or less evenly. And one form of energy would not be favored over another, meaning that important lobbies might be held at bay. In addition, it would have the strong support of environmentalists.</p>
        <p>The public might be sold by the arguments that fuel prices have not risen as fast as other prices in recent years and that Americans generally pay less for energy than do people in Europe and Japan.</p>
        <p>The biggest price difference is in gasoline, which is much more heavily taxed abroad than it is here. In the United States, the Federal gasoline tax is 14.1 cents a gallon, while state and local taxes add 10 cents to 20 cents a gallon. France, by contrast, places a tax of about $2.80 a gallon on gasoline. In Italy the tax is more than $3.50 a gallon, and in Japan it is about $1.70.</p>
