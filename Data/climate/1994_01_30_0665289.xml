        <p>WITH the "Seventh International Exhibition of Botanical Art and Illustration," Wave Hill in Riverdale declares an end to winter and in the same breath draws attention to the Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.</p>
        <p>Since its founding in 1960, the institute has recorded, by way of its prestigious annuals, more than 650 botanical artists who follow in their various 20th-century ways the example set by 18th-century masters like Pierre-Joseph Redoute and Georg Dionysius Ehret. Though an abridged version of the annual, which first appeared at the institute in 1992, the Wave Hill show comes with the original catalogue documenting nearly 90 artists.</p>

        <p>WITH the "Seventh International Exhibition of Botanical Art and Illustration," Wave Hill in Riverdale declares an end to winter and in the same breath draws attention to the Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.</p>
        <p>Since its founding in 1960, the institute has recorded, by way of its prestigious annuals, more than 650 botanical artists who follow in their various 20th-century ways the example set by 18th-century masters like Pierre-Joseph Redoute and Georg Dionysius Ehret. Though an abridged version of the annual, which first appeared at the institute in 1992, the Wave Hill show comes with the original catalogue documenting nearly 90 artists.</p>
        <p>Naturally, the production is aimed at specialists, which means that viewers who can tell, for example, Eurhynchium striatum from Rhytidiadelphus loreus will do better than those who cannot. Many plants are identified, however, by their common names. Besides, no matter how obscure or unprepossessing the subject, a good drawing of it can be pretty seductive, and there are many such drawings in the selection.</p>
        <p>Those who have lived with an amaryllis and fancied they can hear its buds squeaking as they open should appreciate the muscular-looking specimen drawn in color pencil by Leslie Carol Berge. The stem, with its pink and green buds, is unusually short while, protruding from the naked bulb, is the start of a second plant. To this eye, the amaryllis always seems part flesh and blood and part the work of a mad scientist, and the artist's stark image captures both characteristics.</p>
        <p>As portrayed in browns by Thakur Ganga Singh, a Sikh who lived from 1895 to 1970 and was for many years senior artist at the Forest Research Institute in Dehra Dun, India, Bombax malabaricum (kapok) is another weird growth. Sprouting from the same stem are a flower with multiple stamens and leathery-looking petals curling outward, together with shapes like nuts that evidently metamorphose into pods similar to cotton bolls.</p>
        <p>Mr. Singh is one of several Asian-born artists; Jaggu Prasad is another, also from India. His contribution is photorealist apples painted in gouache. There are other departures, like Richard Bolingbroke's "Lilies of the Field," a serigraph, and James Alvin Eder's giant cactus, presumably a saguaro. This sizable acrylic painting focuses on the junction of the plant's body with four writhing arms instead of its general anatomy.</p>
        <p>Such deviations are distracting, for they suggest shortcuts taken in the name of individualism and, as such, seem inappropriate. After all, botanical art is first a discipline and only second (if at all) a vehicle for conscious self-expression.</p>
        <p>Its greatest exponents can be recognized, not by the effort to beat the system, but rather from the variations they introduce. These can be anything from an emphasis on caterpillars, birds and butterflies to the inclusion of habitat. In any case, a botanical drawing that does not define the subject's anatomy is not really a botanical drawing.</p>
        <p>Although photography has left its mark on the genre -- the dramatic angle of Amy C. Storey's "Pickerill Weed" is another example -- the more memorable artists seem to rely on their own remarkable powers of observation. They include Damodar Lal Gurjar, also from India, with dwarf pines and the Canadian Sheila Siegerman, who shows a beautiful orchid-like plant named amber glow.</p>
        <p>Then there is Sue Herbert who, with a disintegrating leaf that makes her less a botanist than a disciple of Andrew Wyeth. Equally faithful to nature but unconcerned with fooling the eye is Francesca Anderson, whose pen drawing of a globe cabbage has the intensity of a Durer engraving.</p>
        <p>Alexander Viazmensky, a Russian artist, achieves a Salvator Rosa-style bravura by suspending mushrooms and toadstools in white space along with dead leaves and bits of straw. A surreal effort that is not included in the show is Hiroki Yoshizawa's pair of dandelions caught in the act of seeding. Compared with this, "Dandelion, Taraxacum officinale" by Pat Marvenko Smith is a Kate Greenaway image, notwithstanding its airbrushed color.</p>
        <p>In addition to the United States, Europe, Africa and the countries already mentioned, many of the artists come from England, where industrial blight began but where, supposedly, everyone is forever puttering in gardens brimming with roses and hollyhocks.</p>
        <p>What made the visit to Wave Hill especially exhilarating for me was not only the art, on view in the Glyndor House, but also its propinquity to a sunroom filled with palms and banana trees and blessed with a view of the estate, then blanketed under snow and ice.</p>
        <p>This calmative spectacle continues through May 15. The number to call for information is (718) 549-3200.  ART</p>
