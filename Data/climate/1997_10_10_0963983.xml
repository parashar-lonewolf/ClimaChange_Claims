        <p>To the dismay of environmentalists seeking swift action to toughen the international treaty on climate change, President Clinton's senior economic and environmental advisers are urging him to delay until the year 2010 and beyond the time when the United States and other industrial nations must achieve deep new reductions in the pollution that may cause global warming.</p>
        <p>Assuming that international negotiations produce such a treaty this year to help control climate change, Mr. Clinton's advisers are warning him not to present it for the Senate's approval unless developing countries first agree, in a separate pact negotiated within the next few years, to control their own emission of greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>The advisers' recommendations were described by leaders of several environmental organizations who said they had been briefed on the proposals. White House officials involved in the discussions today refused to discuss their recommendations, which are in an options paper that they expect to give the President as early as Friday.</p>
        <p>The options were pieced together after strenuous debate between environmental advisers and economic advisers, who expressed reservations about the potential cost of controlling emissions too quickly.</p>
        <p>Among the staff who put together the policy options are Gene Sperling, the President's economic policy assistant; Kathleen McGinty, the head of the Council on Environmental Quality; Todd Stern, a senior aide who is coordinating the policy discussions; and Lawrence Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary.</p>
        <p>Outside environmental advocates, including leaders of the Environmental Defense Fund, the Union of Concerned Scientists, the Sierra Club, and the Environmental Information Center, responded to what they heard by warning the White House that they would actively oppose any agreement along the lines that were being recommended.</p>
        <p>''It's clear that the President's men have blinked,'' said Carl Pope, the executive director of the Sierra Club. ''It remains to be seen if the President will blink.''</p>
        <p>Phil Clapp, executive director of the Environmental Information Center, said that for President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore to accept long delays after campaigning against global warming for years would ''create severe credibility problems for them on almost any environmental issue.''</p>
        <p>On the other hand, powerful industry groups have long urged the Clinton Administration to defer action, saying that not enough is yet known about how the climate might change to justify the potential costs in money and jobs that they contend an all out commitment to reduce emissions would require.</p>
        <p>For their part, the President's advisers say they are determined to offer a plan that is realistic politically and economically, not just attractive on the environmental merits.</p>
        <p>The most aggressive option before the President would call on industrial nations to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases by 2010, without requiring further reductions. Other options would take even longer to stabilize emissions.</p>
        <p>In a treaty signed five years ago in Rio de Janeiro, the United States and other industrial nations said they would try to get emissions reduced, back to the level that existed in 1990, by the year 2000. Most now acknowledge they will not meet that deadline. The United States' emissions are now projected to be 13 percent above 1990 levels by 2000.</p>
        <p>Recognizing that the Rio goals were not sufficient to end the rapid accumulation of greenhouse gases that many scientists say threatens to significantly change the earth's climate in the coming century, the nations that signed that treaty have been trying for two years to negotiate a tougher pact that would set new, binding targets and timetables. The negotiations resume in Bonn on Oct. 20 and are supposed to be completed in Kyoto, Japan, in December.</p>
        <p>The recommendations to President Clinton come a few days after Japan proposed a schedule that would cut emissions 5 percent below 1990 levels by 2010. The European nations have called for reductions of 15 percent below 1990 levels by that time, and some nations have sought even deeper emissions.</p>
        <p>The White House has said it wanted to pursue reductions that would be binding, politically realistic and technically achievable. But so far it has not spelled out specific goals.</p>
        <p>One global warming expert who is close to the Administration said there are three main options on the table: one to stabilize emissions at 1990 levels by 2010, one to do so by 2015 or 2020, and one to gradually reduce the growth rate of emissions and to freeze them some day.</p>
        <p>But the environmental groups said these options do not represent a binding commitment, because they include an escape mechanism that would limit the amount of money American companies would have to spend to meet any emission targets.</p>
        <p>The Administration favors allowing companies to buy and sell emission permits for carbon dioxide, an approach that advocates say would effectively create a marketplace for pollution control ideas and help keep compliance costs down. Companies that come up with cheap controls could sell their permits for a profit.</p>
        <p>But out of fear that emissions controls would be prohibitively expensive, the Administration now is considering putting a cap on the price of the permits and guaranteeing to sell additional permits at that price.</p>
        <p>''This would spoil the market mechanism and remove the incentives to produce innovations,'' said Fred Krupp of the Environmental Defense Fund, who favors trading in emissions permits but joined other environmentalists in denouncing the White House's latest options.</p>
        <p>''That's absolutely bananas,'' retorted Raymond Kopp, an analyst at Resources for the Future, an environmental policy center that supports capping the prices of the permits. ''It is a way of capping the upper limit on the cost of any policy you might come up with.''</p>
        <p>Environmental groups who have been calling for steeper reductions on a faster timetable said that they were ''increasingly concerned'' by reports that the President's aides were recommending further delays.</p>
        <p>''Such policies would be totally inconsistent with the gravity and urgency of the global warming threat,'' said the leaders of 17 environmental organizations in a letter to Mr. Clinton written Wednesday, after White House aides informed them of the options under consideration.</p>
        <p>They said they would be ''compelled to oppose'' a policy that ''simply seeks to freeze emissions at 1990 levels by 2010 or later, or that includes a treaty-busting escape clause.''</p>
