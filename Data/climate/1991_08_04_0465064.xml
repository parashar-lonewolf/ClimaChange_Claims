        <p>The California economy has proved remarkably resistant to five years of drought, but the state's slow and short-sighted response may have inflicted irreversible damage on the environment.</p>
        <p>That is a central conclusion of a broad study, made public on Thursday, of the economic and environmental effects of the severe drought that has gripped the West. The study was conducted by the Pacific Institute for Studies in Development, Environment and Security, a nonpartisan research organization based in Berkeley, and was requested by the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health and the Environment, which held a hearing on the subject Thursday in Washington.</p>

        <p>The California economy has proved remarkably resistant to five years of drought, but the state's slow and short-sighted response may have inflicted irreversible damage on the environment.</p>
        <p>That is a central conclusion of a broad study, made public on Thursday, of the economic and environmental effects of the severe drought that has gripped the West. The study was conducted by the Pacific Institute for Studies in Development, Environment and Security, a nonpartisan research organization based in Berkeley, and was requested by the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health and the Environment, which held a hearing on the subject Thursday in Washington.</p>
        <p>The authors charged that state leaders had been unwilling to recognize that the drought might persist for several years and had continued to support wasteful uses of water by drawing reservoirs down to dangerously low levels for the first four years of the drought. From this, the report drew a pessimistic lesson about how the region might respond to the possibility of permanent climate change. "The experience of the drought suggests that California will not address climatic changes with specific policies until long after the impacts are being felt." Damage to Ecosystems</p>
        <p>The report found that while the effects varied, farming and ranching had survived well by switching crops, pumping more water from under the ground and making more efficient use of irrigation water. Strong demand for California products meant that gross agricultural receipts reached a record high last year, although not so high as they might have been with more precipitation. But the study predicted that the longer-term costs to agriculture could be far higher if the drought persists another year.</p>
        <p>The state's fragile natural ecosystems, many already weakened by human activities, have fared much worse, according to the study, which was financed by the Environmental Protection Agency. While other factors contributed, the study cited these direct effects of the drought:</p>
        <p>*The winter-run chinook salmon, already listed as a threatened species, is facing extinction because of low river flows. And the catch of coho and chinook salmon off the coast has plummeted, to 4.4 million pounds in 1990, a 70 percent drop in two years.</p>
        <p>*The number of striped bass in the Sacramento Delta and in San Francisco Bay has dropped steadily since 1987.</p>
        <p>*The herring fishery in Tomales Bay, north of San Francisco, has been destroyed because the reduced flow of fresh water has made the bay too salty; the fish may never recover.</p>
        <p>*The decline in the number of water fowl has been quickened as wetland habitats shrink and deteriorate.</p>
        <p>*Large patches of trees in the Sierra Nevada have died from lack of water and pest infestation.</p>
        <p>In addition, the report said the drought posed added danger to numerous endangered and threatened animal and plant species, including bald eagles, the giant garter snake, 9 types of butterflies and 10 herbs. Hydroelectric Power Loss</p>
        <p>Peter H. Gleick and Linda Nash, who wrote the report, said a a chief economic cost was the massive loss of hydroelectric power. In normal years such power accounts for 20 percent of the state's total electric supply, but it dropped to 12 percent last year. This meant that utilities had to replace it by burning fossil fuels, at an additional cost of $2.4 billion and increased air pollution.</p>
        <p>While the overall economy appeared to be resilient to drought, the report said certain industries showed large losses, including skiing, boating and tourism.</p>
        <p>The authors said the drought had a positive effect of forcing California to re-examine its water policies, but they found the short-term resiliency of the economy to be deceptive. Up to now, they said, well water and reservoir storage have been used as a buffer against more severe impacts, but those supplies would eventually be depleted if the drought persisted.</p>
