        <p>Breaking a political impasse that had pitted the Middle West against the Northeast for more than 10 years, House and Senate negotiators rewriting the Clean Air Act reached agreement today on new regulations to reduce environmental damage caused by acid rain.</p>
        <p>The new rules are intended to allow lakes, streams and forests polluted by the corrosive rain to repair themselves naturally by cutting by about half the amount of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide that can be poured from smokestacks into the atmosphere. Both compounds have been identified by scientists as important components of acid precipitation.</p>
        <p>The rules affect virtually every electric utility in the United States that burns coal or oil as well as hundreds of factories. Congressional experts estimated that the cost of complying with the regulations could reach $2 billion to $4 billion annually.</p>
        <p>In reaching the agreement on acid rain before dawn today, the conference committee settled the last of the major differences on the clean air legislation and set the stage for approving the entire package on Monday. Lawmakers from both parties said today that the breakthrough on the rules for limiting acid rain could not have occurred without the intervention of President Bush.</p>
        <p>In June 1989, Mr. Bush proposed changes in the 20-year-old Clean Air Act that became the template for new rules agreed to today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's proposal marked a break with the policy of the Reagan Administration, which for eight years essentially opposed all efforts to impose pollution requirements on industry. At the time Mr. Bush's proposals led to expectations that the Congressional deadlock over revisions of the Clean Air Act would end, and today leading members of Congress predicted that the President would sign it.</p>
        <p>But a White House spokeswoman said today that the President was waiting to see the entire package and had not decided whether to sign the bill.</p>
        <p>Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan and leader of the House delegation to the conference, called the acid rain provisions an important achievement. "It resolves a major controversy," said Mr. Dingell. "I think the President will sign it. He'll make a prodigious mistake if he decides not to."</p>
        <p>The conferees agreed to follow the plan for reducing acid rain that was passed in May by the Senate. That plan calls for a two-step process to cut pollution from sulfur dioxide 12 million to 14 million tons annually by the year 2000.</p>
        <p>Half of the total sulfur dioxide reductions would be required by Jan. 1, 1995, when the 111 largest sulfur-emitting electric utility plants in 22 states would have to meet stricter standards for sulfur emissions. Most of the plants are in the Middle West. Stiff Fines Are Provided</p>
        <p>Nitrogen oxide emissions would be reduced by requiring utilities to meet the first specific limits on the pollutant ever approved by Congress. The first limits for nitrogen oxide would go into effect 18 months after the bill is approved. Additional limits could be established in 1997. The conferees sought a reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions that total 2 million to 4 million tons a year by the end of the decade.</p>
        <p>The conferees also agreed to rules requiring stiff fines for utilities and industries that fail to meet the new standards. Lawmakers said they wanted to make the fines so expensive that utilities that broke the rules would not incorporate the penalties into the routine cost of doing business.</p>
        <p>"It's the best blend for a strong bill that we could have reached agreement on," said Representative Dennis E. Eckart, a Democrat of Ohio and a member of the House delegation. "Clearly New England, which is at the receiving end of acid rain deposition from the Ohio Valley, will see a reduction. How long it will take to solve what is a very complex problem, I can't say."</p>
        <p>A representative of the utility industry said today that some power plants have already installed pollution control equipment and switched to coal with less sulfur to meet the requirements of the proposed regulations. Other plants may need to spend $100 million or more on environmental equipment to avoid fines and penalties. Utilities Already Changing</p>
        <p>"We switched to low-sulfur coal and are already meeting the standards," said Gay H. Friedman, director of Federal Government affairs for the Northern States Power Company, a utility based in Minneapolis that serves 1.6 million customers in five states. "But there are a number of other companies in which compliance will be much more difficult."</p>
        <p>Still to be resolved by the negotiators is a proposal by the House to establish a $250 million fund to compensate workers who could lose their jobs as a result of a new law and differing proposals to eliminate air pollution in national parks.</p>
        <p>When Congress last agreed on amendments to the Clean Air Act in 1977, it was generally assumed by lawmakers, environmentalists and business executives that Congress would routinely update the law as understanding increased of the effects of air pollution on the environment and public health.</p>
        <p>But until the breakthrough this year, attempts to amend the law were foiled by regional disagreements over the sources of acid rain, the extent of the damage it caused and the cost of limiting or halting sulfur and nitrogen emissions. Ravaged Lakes and Forests</p>
        <p>Lawmakers from Kentucky, West Virginia, Ohio and other coal mining states argued that thousands of jobs would be lost if utilities switched to coal mined in the West that contains less sulfur. Utilities in the Middle West complained that switching fuel and installing pollution control equipment on smokestacks at their generating stations would be prohibitively expensive.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, scientific evidence of environmental problems caused by the acid precipitation was mounting. The number of lakes turned into aquatic death traps grew across New York, New England and the South. Stretches of forest along the Appalachian spine from Georgia to Maine, once lush and teeming with wildlife, were filling with dead and dying trees.</p>
        <p>In a comprehensive report early this year the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program found six areas of the country where the problem requires special attention: the southwestern Adirondacks, New England, the Atlantic coastal plain, contiguous part of northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, the Appalachians as far south as North Carolina and the northern Florida highlands. The report said the six areas accounted for almost all the lakes and streams acidified by acid rain.  Other Emissions Cited</p>
        <p>Scientists have said in a number of studies that sulfur and nitrogen emissions from power plants is an important source of acidic rain, but not the sole cause. Emissions from motor vehicles, factories, small businesses and other polluters, they said, are also factors, particularly in regions near metropolitan centers.</p>
        <p>The conferees previously approved regulations designed to reduce emissions from these sources, and lawmakers said today that the entire package should sharply reduce the contaminants that form acid rain and help wild areas to heal.</p>
        <p>"I feel like I've given birth after a seven-year pregnancy," said Representative Gerry Sikorski, a Democrat of Minnesota and a member of the House delegation. "Acid rain has been the engine for amending this legislation this year and the brake. The regional animosities always came in to hold it back. Now we're going to be able to recover the lakes in Adirondacks and the spruce forests in the South."</p>
