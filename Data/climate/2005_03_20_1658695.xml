        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>This hearing on steroid use in baseball was a huge waste of our Congressional representatives' time and our money. If these representatives were concerned about saving lives, they would not have supported the war in Iraq. If they were serious about saving lives, they would be outlawing guns in this society.</p>

        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>This hearing on steroid use in baseball was a huge waste of our Congressional representatives' time and our money. If these representatives were concerned about saving lives, they would not have supported the war in Iraq. If they were serious about saving lives, they would be outlawing guns in this society.</p>
        <p>If they were really concerned about saving lives, they would be addressing the problems of population growth, poverty, H.I.V., AIDS and a multitude of other infectious diseases. If they were serious about saving lives, they would be working on renewable energy with the hope of heading off the disastrous effects -- global warming and environmental degradation -- of our addiction to fossil fuels. The ignorance and hypocrisy of these representatives is, in general, a far greater problem than the use of steroids by a few professional athletes.</p>
