        <p>The Bush administration appears to be on the verge of reversing a Clinton-era ban on snowmobiles that was to go into effect in two years here in the nation's oldest national park.</p>
        <p>For several weeks, the Departments of Interior and Justice have been negotiating the settlement of a suit brought by snowmobile makers seeking ways to avoid the ban and allow the motorized sleds to keep using the park's well-groomed roads.</p>
        <p>Those close to the negotiations said they expected that the administration would allow a limited number of snowmobiles in Yellowstone a day and require that they be equipped with new technology engines that the industry says are cleaner and quieter. A decision favorable to the industry is expected shortly.</p>
        <p>''We don't want unreasonable access to the park,'' said Ed Klim, president of the International Snowmobile Manufacturers Association, which brought the suit. ''But we think being able to ride on the same roads that you'd drive your car on, with controls, for 12 weeks a year, is reasonable.''</p>
        <p>Such a decision would come over the objections of the National Park Service, whose rangers here say the ban would limit pollution, noise and congestion in the park and protect wildlife. It was the park service that suggested banning snowmobiles and replacing them with snow coaches --  15-passenger buses outfitted with special tires and skilike runners that glide over the snow.</p>
        <p>In the winter, the lineup of snowmobilers buying park passes turns the ticket booths into what Bob Seibert, a ranger here, calls a ''tunnel of fumes.'' Working here, Mr. Seibert said, ''is like being in a bar -- you're dizzy, nauseous, your throat is burning and your eyes are burning.''</p>
        <p>The ban was imposed at the end of the Clinton presidency after three years of discussion that included two dozen public hearings and 46,500 written public comments, about half of which favored a ban while half opposed it.</p>
        <p>Lifting the snowmobile ban would represent only the latest in a series of President Bush's reversals of his predecessor's environmental policies. The administration announced on Wednesday that it was abandoning a Clinton administration plan to reintroduce grizzly bears in the West. In addition, Mr. Bush has spurned the international treaty on climate change, is reviewing new standards for arsenic in drinking water and intends to scale back a plan to bar development in about one-third of the national forests.</p>
        <p>It is possible that a decision on snowmobiles could be stalled by the weight of public opinion that appears to be building against Mr. Bush on environmental matters. Members of his own party dealt him a political blow on Thursday when the House rejected his plan to drill for oil off the coast of Florida or in areas designated as national monuments. And polls show that Americans give Mr. Bush his weakest marks on environmental issues. The most recent New York Times/CBS News poll showed that 46 percent of people disapproved of Mr. Bush's handling of the environment, while 39 percent approved.</p>
        <p>If the Bush presidency has dismayed environmentalists, it has given new voice to those who believe that the Clinton administration was guided by environmental extremists whose zeal in protecting the parks led to closing off too much public land to taxpayers.</p>
        <p>In the waning days of the Clinton administration, several groups, responding to a frontier independence and antiregulatory fervor, formed a coalition to reclaim what they call ''access,'' particularly to national parks. The groups include makers of snowmobiles, Jet Skis, motorcycles, off-road vehicles and recreational campers. Keeping snowmobiles in Yellowstone is their immediate priority, both because it is a high-profile symbol of their cause and because they worry that if they lose in Yellowstone, they will lose elsewhere.</p>
        <p>In the three decades that snowmobiles have been allowed in Yellowstone, the park has developed a reputation, aided by the marketing efforts of snowmobile rental agencies,  as providing one of the nation's premiere snowmobiling experiences.</p>
        <p>Brad Schmier, who helps run a family business here called Yellowstone Adventures, said Yellowstone was viewed as the apex of snowmobiling. ''In the national forests, it's a bunch of trees, but in the park, the scenery is unique -- the geyser activity, the wildlife,'' said Mr. Schmier, whose business rents snowmobiles to park visitors. ''A snowmobile lets you be at one with the elements on your own little vehicle. The majority of people who come here like that independence, being able to go at their own schedules -- that will be a hard thing to take away from us Americans.''</p>
        <p>In the three-month snowmobile season that just ended -- notable for its lack of snow -- 83,548 people (an average of 928 a day) zoomed into Yellowstone on snowmobiles, while 43,036 drove in in cars. Cars are banned in the winter from the west entrance here, but cars are allowed in elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Mr. Klim, of the snowmobile manufacturers group, said the negotiations appeared to be leading toward a limit of perhaps 800 snowmobiles a day on a first-come, first-serve basis.</p>
        <p>Kevin Collins, director of park recreation and use for the National Parks Conservation Association, an environmental group focused on protecting the parks, said he believed the administration would favor the industry, regardless of public opinion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Collins said he expected the administration to justify lifting the ban by ordering a new environmental impact statement that would find that newer snowmobiles were cleaner and quieter.</p>
        <p>''They will probably put a cap on the numbers or have guided trips,'' Mr. Collins said, adding that he expected ''they will allow some level of recreational snowmobiling back in the park.''</p>
        <p>As for snow coaches, environmentalists hope they will prove less destructive to the park's legendary bison, who, in fleeing the noisy snowmobiles, are forced farther into deeper snow where it is harder to find food. They also hope that snow coaches can help pave the way for a mass transit system here like those in Yosemite and Zion national parks.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Schmier, the snowmobile rental agent, has no use for snow coaches.</p>
        <p>''Do I want to climb in a coach with 10 other people and somebody's whiny kid and sit there shoulder to shoulder with everybody and climb in and out when the driver decides we're going to stop?'' Mr. Schmier asked. ''It doesn't sound like fun to me.''</p>
