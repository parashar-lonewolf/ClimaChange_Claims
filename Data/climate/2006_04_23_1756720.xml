        <p>WINDSWEPT</p>
        <p>The Story of Wind and Weather.</p>
        <p>By Marq de Villiers.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 344 pp.</p>

        <p>IF raging storms have a sensitive dependence on initial conditions, in the words of the chaos theorists, so -- it would seem -- does Marq de Villiers, a co-author of ''Sahara: The Extraordinary History of the World's Largest Desert.'' Early in ''Windswept'' he writes, ''In the grip of the gale, the child skidded across the grass until he landed with a crack against the metal railings that were all that prevented him from being hurled into the ocean. . . . It was there that my mother came, and fetched me away, and tried to still my terror with her beating heart.'' A fear of big wind has never left him (it doesn't help that he's practically a magnet for hurricanes), but luckily for us, it's driven him to investigate how bad weather starts, and why.</p>
        <p>To dramatize the search for answers, de Villiers unfurls and magnifies the story of Hurricane Ivan, a peculiarly malevolent storm in 2004 that lasted nearly three weeks, killed scores of people, turned out the lights in more than a million homes and spawned some 111 tornadoes in five states. Like many Atlantic storms, Ivan began as an updraft in the southern Sahara. How it intensified (or became ''better organized,'' in the parlance of meteorologists), raged and eventually split in two, with one track whipping across de Villiers's Nova Scotia beach, makes a compelling ticktock and vividly illustrates that science knows a great deal about the how and when of storm formation, but not so much about the why. The same initial conditions that cause hurricanes can also beget nothing.</p>
        <p>''Windswept'' moves breezily through the meaning of wind -- what it represented for the ancients, and how it was personified as arbitrary and angry -- to a history of our understanding of it, from early measurements of air pressure to the discovery that storms travel, and then on to the science of accurate measurement, the art of prediction and the appearance, on Jan. 11, 1954, of the first TV forecast. ''Well-coiffed weather people have been with us ever since,'' the author writes. Some of the liveliest bits cover how wind smashes up structures and how it has been used for sailing, flying, cooling, grinding corn and generating power. Throughout, de Villiers stresses that winds are important agents of planetary self-government, and as such make life on earth possible. Winds, both gentle and giant, redistribute air, moisture and heat vertically and latitudinally, they scrub the air of pollutants, and they accelerate the movement of the great ocean currents that keep our planet stable.</p>
        <p>It's a sunny picture, one that leads de Villiers to marvel at our cosmic connection to the planetary whole, which he briefly likens to a drafty dance hall. But on further rumination, ''this was not as comfortable a feeling as you might expect, because there is a practical downside as well as a philosophical upside to interconnectedness.'' You can hear the other shoe drop: ''We're all shut-ins in this great global ballroom,'' and we're poisoning it with the byproducts of coal-combustion, with aerosols, ozone, organic pollutants and heavy metals. The amount of transported African dust, laden with fungal spores and bacterial cysts, has risen steadily over the past 25 years, along with the mortality rates of Caribbean coral and sea fans -- ''an object lesson in the interconnectedness of life.'' And he hasn't even gotten to the ways that higher global temperatures will affect the wind, the weather and the climate.</p>
        <p>Early on, de Villiers warns that winds are ''horribly intricate in their local behavior.'' The reader sighs, knowing the author's going to make a stab at explaining that behavior. Soon enough, there is a slog through intertropical convergence zones, tropical cyclone bogussing schemes and a lot of drawings with arrows. De Villiers admits this isn't always simple, and that's a comfort. His clarity and sense of humor help, too: part of the ionosphere, he writes, has a frequency that reflects medium-wave radio transmissions, ''thereby allowing Midwestern country-and-western stations to be heard over the horizon in, say, Maine, to the great benefit of listeners there pining for hurtin' music.''</p>
        <p>If you can get through the tough parts -- which, let's face it, are mandatory in this sort of book -- there's ample reward. Bad weather almost always makes good copy, and those who study wind and weather can be counted on to do all sorts of neat things, like flying planes into howling hurricanes, building massive wind tunnels and modeling the topography and breezes around the 11th green and 12th tee of Augusta National Golf Course, which have been known to wreak havoc with ''the pocketbooks of a handful of very wealthy men.'' After firing a current through a copper wire coated with titanium tetrachloride (representing the ball's trajectory), filming the smoke and plotting its path on digital video with ''stereoscopic particle imaging velocimetry,'' researchers determined that, yes, the wind was a little screwy around the Amen Corner, and it's all because of the trees. Was Augusta going to remove them? No way.</p>
        <p>The pace of ''Windswept'' falters toward the end, but develops a rush of moral certitude when the author visits various wind farms (at one, the tips of enormous blades spin well in excess of 100 miles per hour in a fresh breeze) and contemplates a future without oil. De Villiers is realistic about the benefits, the hype and the true price of wind power (the wind industry, he says, has an ''inbuilt propensity to exaggerate and lie''), but ultimately he comes down in its favor. His arguments, coming after a gloomy section on global warming, ring loud and clear. ''Nature has given us the perpetual motion machine we call wind. We can put it to work to make things better.''</p>
