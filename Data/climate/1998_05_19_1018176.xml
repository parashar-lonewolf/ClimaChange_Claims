        <p>HE task facing food scientists at Cornell University here is formidable: devising tasty, appealing, nutritious dishes for consumption on the Moon, Mars, Jupiter -- anywhere that astronauts might set up long-term housekeeping -- using only about two dozen foods from crops that can be grown hydroponically in space.</p>
        <p>Not only that, but the ingredients and the dishes made from them must be relatively easy to prepare by people whose primary training is in space, not kitchen, science. And the whole creative process has to be cheaper than shipping ready-made supplies from Earth, which could take months to years.</p>
        <p>Planners have already rejected the shriveled freeze-dried concoctions or pureed foods squeezed from toothpaste tubes, foods that astronauts routinely dump the way schoolchildren discard unwanted contents of their lunch boxes. To maintain their health and energy for many months or years at a time, astronauts will have to eat everything on their plates, so their food must be appetizing. Unlike astronauts free-floating in space who were forced to eat from containers, those in land-based space stations would have enough gravity to hold their food on plates, which broadens the options but also demands that the foods have eye appeal.</p>
        <p>Besides, as Dr. Jean Hunter, a principal investigator on the space food project, put it, ''When people are living in a closed system for a long time, food becomes larger than life.'' Dr. Hunter said that Jack Stuster, a specialist on isolation and confined environments who wrote ''Bold Endeavors'' (U.S. Naval Institute Press, 1996), had showed that ''food assumes a much larger importance when other sources of sensory input and variety are limited, as when people are living in confined quarters like a space station, where they can't really get out much, they don't see anyone except other members of the team, they look at the same walls, floors and ceilings every day, and they're very far from home.''</p>
        <p>The researchers here have been at work for a year now, under a three-year, $507,000 grant from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which is working toward eventually establishing a colony on Mars. So far the researchers say they are thrilled with what they have managed to create from the limited list of ingredients, none of which come from animals.</p>
        <p>Animals in a space station would compete with the astronauts for oxygen, food and territory and add to the already onerous task of recycling digestive waste. Plants, on the other hand, cleanse the air of carbon dioxide and release much-needed oxygen and water. In addition, they flourish on the liquids and nutrient-rich fertilizer from sanitized human waste. In every way possible, the environment in a remote space station must be self-sustaining, constantly recycling materials and regenerating basic resources.</p>
        <p>Among the more winning plant-based dishes devised by Adriana Rovers, herself a longtime vegetarian and cooking teacher, are cream of red pepper soup (creamed with soy milk), vegetarian fajitas (with seitan, a protein product extracted from wheat flour, fashioned to simulate meat or chicken) served on whole wheat tortillas and topped with tomato salsa and tofu sour cream and, for dessert, sweet potato pie.</p>
        <p>To put the Cornell creations to the supreme test, two dozen carnivorous volunteers (few astronauts are vegetarian) 30 to 50 years old have been recruited to taste-test the vegan dishes that Ms. Rovers prepares, some of which are derived from recipes gleaned from a dozen vegetarian cookbooks. Among the dishes the tasters have evaluated so far are an Italian menu of lentil loaf, focaccia, field peas with kale and sweet potatoes; a salad dressed with a creamy tarragon vinaigrette and biscotti, and a Thai menu of pad thai noodles with peanut sauce, fresh cucumber salad, fried rice, spring rolls and yams.</p>
        <p>''We're looking internationally to produce a culturally varied cuisine,'' said Rupert Spies, a chef and lecturer at Cornell's School of Hotel Administration. ''After all, space stations are not likely to be staffed only by American explorers.''</p>
        <p>Ammar Olabi, a graduate student in food science from Lebanon whose job includes analyzing the score cards, said that so far most of the dishes the tasters rated had passed a test, devised by the Army, for ''hedonic value'' or gustatory appeal. A broccoli and mushroom dish commanded the highest overall acceptance score of 7.7 on a 9-point scale in which 1 means ''dislike extremely'' and 9 means ''like extremely.'' A sandwich of oven-roasted vegetables seasoned with Balsamic vinegar on whole wheat bread came in a close second, with a rating of 7.3. The vinegar would have to be supplied from Earth, but a bread machine would be standard equipment in space.</p>
        <p>The tasters rejected chocolate soy milk and soy nog, giving them the lowest ratings to date of 5.2 and 5.3, below the Army's cutoff for acceptability, which is 6. Because natural sources of sweeteners like sugar cane, sorghum and honey (which requires bees), are not adaptable to space station horticulture, desserts in general have been a problem.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spies blames the ''made-in-space'' sweetener that NASA has been using: amazake, made from rice that has been fermented by a fungus and then combined with wheat starch. The rice, a product called koji that is used to make sake, contains fungal enzymes that break down the wheat starch to form a sweet paste. But amazake has a distinct flavor as well as texture, and lacks the intense sweetness of sugar that is desirable in a dessert.</p>
        <p>''For desserts, we may have to resort to using a concentrated sugar substitute brought from home,'' Mr. Spies said. But Dr. Hunter maintained that ''amazake is really great in bread,'' and added, ''Its sweetness gives the yeast something to chew on and it enhances the moistness and shelf life of the loaf.''</p>
        <p>In developing her recipes, Ms. Rovers must keep in mind that only 10 percent to 15 percent of calories will be supplied by ingredients imported from Earth. That includes occasional earthly treats like steak, ice cream and chocolate that NASA plans to send in space for ''celebration meals,'' Dr. Hunter said. Thus far, on average, only 5 percent of the calories in Ms. Rovers's dishes would come from imported foods, mainly seasonings and flavorings.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hunter, an agricultural and biological engineer at Cornell's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and College of Engineering, directs the project with Dr. David Levitsky, a professor of nutritional science and psychology who oversees the nutritional value of the diet. His job will include getting astronauts familiar with the unusual foods and giving them a sense of mastery and pride in preparing dishes that are attractive and tasty.</p>
        <p>''The astronauts' diet has to meet minimum requirements and be nutritionally balanced over a period of weeks, but it can't be in excess of requirements because it's very costly in time and energy to grow the food in space,'' Dr. Levitsky said. ''And because the cost of producing energy is so high, these diets will be low in fat -- about 15 percent of calories from fat, I would guess. Will this decrease the absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Olabi said there were special nutritional requirements for astronauts. Since astronauts lose bone mass under weightless conditions, they need more calcium and vitamin D than earthbound people. Astronauts also need less iron and, because sodium increases bone loss and results in urine too salty for the plants, they must consume less salt.</p>
        <p>Further challenging Ms. Rovers's creativity with seasonings, Mr. Olabi said, is the fact that ''in space there's a fluid shift toward the upper part of the body, causing sino-nasal passages to swell and impairing the astronauts' ability to smell and taste.''</p>
        <p>Another challenge involves the production of edible oils in space. Dr. Hunter is starting with single-cell oil production using a yeast called Cryptococcus curvatus, which accumulates oil when grown in a nitrogen-poor environment. Although 35 percent of the yeast's dry weight is oil, researchers thus far have gleaned only one-tenth of a gram that could be used in cooking.</p>
        <p>''We're looking to make the process more efficient,'' Dr. Hunter said. Another approach, producing peanut oil in space, does not look promising. She said peanuts do not grow efficiently in hydroponic culture, and extracting their oil causes considerable waste.</p>
        <p>The yeast method, however, uses wheat straw, already an agricultural waste product from space-grown wheat. The engineering process resembles what happens naturally in a cow's stomach. Lignin, an indigestible fiber in straw, is digested to form cellulose, and enzymes turn the cellulose into glucose, which is used to feed the yeast.</p>
        <p>The ultimate goal, of course, would be to develop a fully automated system that would work in space to produce ingredients like oil and seitan, the protein from wheat. Ms. Rovers said Cornell's food science engineers were already at work developing a seitan machine that would mix wheat flour and water to form clumps of dough, then gently wash them to separate the wheat starch from the protein-rich gluten, creating seitan.</p>
        <p>The project's overall goal ''is not just to develop recipes,'' Dr. Hunter said, adding: ''It's to help NASA make decisions about food supplies for long-distance missions. That involves arriving at cost estimates for all the ingredients for all the foods to give us a relative price on food in space terms. Instead of just considering nutritional requirements, we will also consider esthetics and variety.''</p>
        <p>The researchers have to compare the cost of preparing different foods from the same ingredient and factor in the value of variety. A plain baked potato may have the same food value as a fancy potato dish that is much more costly in labor and equipment, but is also more appealing and more likely to be eaten.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spies also sees the project's potential value on Earth. ''It could help us mainstream vegetarian foods,'' he said. ''About 20 percent of people who go to restaurants look for vegetarian dishes, even if they're not vegetarians, and about 15 percent of college students choose vegetarian alternatives.''</p>
        <p>The potential carry-over to earthlings was also cited by Dr. Levitsky, who said, ''This project should help us learn how to get people to eat different diets that would improve their health.''</p>
        <p>SEITAN FAJITAS</p>
        <p>Developed by Adriana Rovers at Cornell University, for use in a space colony.</p>
        <p>8 ounces seitan (a protein product made from wheat)</p>
        <p>1 medium green bell pepper</p>
        <p>1 medium red bell pepper</p>
        <p>1 medium onion</p>
        <p>1/2 tablespoon minced garlic</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon oil, divided</p>
        <p>1 1/2 cups salsa</p>
        <p>1 cup soy sour cream (recipe below)</p>
        <p>shredded lettuce</p>
        <p>2  tomatoes, chopped</p>
        <p>whole wheat tortillas (recipe</p>
        <p>below).</p>
        <p>Drain seitan and saute it with garlic in  1/2 tablespoon of oil. Transfer ingredients to a dish, stir in cumin and set aside. In remaining oil, saute green and red bell peppers and onion for three to five minutes. Return seitan mixture to the pan and warm through. Fill center of a warmed tortilla with the seitan mixture. Top with salsa, lettuce, tomato and sour cream. Roll up and secure with a toothpick.</p>
        <p>WHOLE WHEAT TORTILLAS</p>
        <p>1 cup whole wheat bread flour</p>
        <p>2 cups unbleached white flour</p>
        <p>3/4 teaspoon salt</p>
        <p>1/3 cup oil</p>
        <p>1 cup warm water.</p>
        <p>Place flour and salt in bowl of food processor or bread mixer. Add oil and process about two minutes. Add water slowly to form a dough ball. Transfer dough to a work surface and knead dough until it is smooth and elastic, sprinkling in a little extra flour, if necessary. Let dough rest in a bowl, covered with plastic wrap, for at least 30 minutes before baking. Divide dough into 12 to 15 balls, each about 1 inch in diameter. With a rolling pin, roll each ball into a 6-inch circle about  1/8 inch thick. Cook quickly on both sides in a hot nonstick skillet. Or, starting with the 1-inch balls, cook the tortillas one at a time in a very hot tortilla press.</p>
        <p>TOFU SOUR CREAM</p>
        <p>3/4 cup (6 ounces) firm silken tofu, drained</p>
        <p>1/4 cup soy milk (unsweetened)</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon salt</p>
        <p>Chopped chives for garnish.</p>
        <p>Place all ingredients except chives into a food processor or blender and process until smooth and creamy. Garnish with chives.</p>
        <p>CROPS IN SPACE</p>
        <p>Hydroponically grown crops will be almost the entire source of ingredients for the foods astronauts will consume on remote space stations in decades to come. The list of crops, which must supply nearly all the astronauts' protein as well as vitamins, minerals, fiber and culinary variety, includes plants well-adapted to growing in nutrient-enriched water and short enough to fit in the troughs that will be available in space.</p>
        <p>Wheat</p>
        <p>Potatoes</p>
        <p>Sweet potatoes</p>
        <p>Soybeans</p>
        <p>Peanuts</p>
        <p>Common beans (kidney, lentils, etc.)</p>
        <p>Rice</p>
        <p>Chard</p>
        <p>Quinoa</p>
        <p>Lettuce</p>
        <p>Tomatoes</p>
        <p>Cucumbers</p>

        <p>Bell peppers</p>
        <p>Chili peppers</p>
        <p>Watercress</p>
