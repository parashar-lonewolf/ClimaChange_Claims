        <p>How, at a stroke, can America trim oil imports, cut the trade deficit, reduce smog and help avert global warming? By inducing Detroit to make more fuel-efficient cars. Last week, in a notable reversal of Reagan Administration policy, Washington took one of the necessary steps: Secretary of Transportation Samuel Skinner told the protesting auto industry that its 1990 model cars must average 27.5 miles per gallon. But to wean consumers from gas guzzlers, a more profound change is necessary - a hefty increase in the gas tax.</p>
        <p>Under a law passed after the 1974 oil crisis, the fuel efficiency required of new cars rose from 14.2 to a target of 27.5 miles per gallon in 1985. Each mile-per-gallon increase saves 420,000 barrels of oil a day. Yet this program offended the anti-regulatory attitudes of the Reagan Administration.</p>
        <p>In 1986, Vice President Bush, as chairman of the Task Force on Regulatory Relief, proposed abolishing the fuel-efficiency standards. Secretary of Transportation James Burnley derided them as a ''dinosaur that should be extinct.'' Under pleading from General Motors and Ford, whose fleets are tilted toward heavier cars, the Reagan Administration let the fuel standards from 1986 onward drop as low as 26 miles per gallon.</p>
        <p>That's one reason foreign oil imports have now again topped eight million barrels a day. Oil imports account for one-third of America's trade deficit and increase dependency on the Persian Gulf. The new Administration, more pragmatic than its predecessor, has recognized the value of fuel economy and refused to continue waiving the standards. But there's no reason to stop at 27.5. Engineers at Chrysler, which has not supported a waiver, believe the auto makers can improve mileage by about half a mile per gallon every year. Even a target of 45 miles per gallon by 2000 seems attainable.</p>
        <p>Such efficiency gains would sharply reduce air pollution and also carbon dioxide that helps trap the sun's heat. Though it's too early to be sure the earth's climate will heat up, it's soon enough to reduce all avoidable sources of carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>The auto industry as a whole opposes further improvements in fuel efficiency on the ground that the law discriminates against domestic manufacturers, which prefer making larger cars. Congress could put right that defect by requiring all manufacturers, domestic and foreign, to make the same percentage improvement in their fleets' efficiency.</p>
        <p>Another argument is that more fuel-efficient cars are lighter and more dangerous in an accident. But with better design, like air bags and anti-lock brakes, cars can be made safer as well as more fuel-efficient.</p>
        <p>Some economists frown on fuel-efficiency standards as a clumsy device compared with a higher gas tax, which would achieve the same goal better. They're right. There's no reason to limit fuel-efficiency gains to buyers of new cars. A sharply increased gasoline tax would encourage shrewd conservation by everyone. But the President opposes new taxes and while that remains true, there's every reason to press for both remedies: more efficient cars and more affected drivers.</p>
