        <p>BECAUSE they are both lightweight and strong, graphite tennis racquets have in the last decade eclipsed those made of wood or aluminum. But the graphite frames tend to vibrate more than those of other materials and therefore, some think, aggravate such afflictions as tennis elbow.</p>

        <p>BECAUSE they are both lightweight and strong, graphite tennis racquets have in the last decade eclipsed those made of wood or aluminum. But the graphite frames tend to vibrate more than those of other materials and therefore, some think, aggravate such afflictions as tennis elbow.</p>
        <p>Brett P. Bothwell, an architectural designer in Manhattan who sometimes creates graphite furniture and also works as a tennis pro, said he had invented  a way to reduce a racquet's vibration by using air pressure to tighten its strings.</p>
        <p>The hoop, or head, of Mr. Bothwell's racquet has an outside frame and an inside frame between which he has fitted two air bladders resembling bicycle tire tubes.</p>
        <p>"As the bladders fill with air, the outer frame is pushed away from the inner frame, thereby stretching the strings," Mr. Bothwell said. "This air system gives the racquet an enlarged sweet spot -- that place where you feel no vibration, just a clean, strong hit."</p>
        <p>A hand-held carbon dioxide cartridge inserted into the racquet handle inflates the bladders. The string tension can be adjusted by adding or releasing some carbon dioxide. "I've designed the racquet so that you can use the same cartridges used to inflate Reebok's Instapump athletic sneakers," Mr. Bothwell said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bothwell received patent 5,458,331.</p>
        <p>A Toothbrush For Dentures</p>
        <p>Washing dentures can be a tricky task for those with arthritis or other physical limitations. "If you drop and break them not only do you have the expense of replacing them but you also have the social difficulty of being without teeth," said Martin Lewkowicz, a former dentist, who has designed a special toothbrush that he said a user can grip firmly in any position.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lewkowicz's invention is shorter and fatter than the average toothbrush and is curvy and clad in a non-slip rubber. At its head it sprouts two sets of brushes that meet at a slightly obtuse angle.</p>
        <p>"Most of the other brushes on the market have thin, flat handles, which makes them difficult to hold," Dr. Lewkowicz said. "Because of the contours and the rubber panels on this one, you can grip it even if your hands are wet and slippery."</p>
        <p>Dr. Lewkowicz is executive vice president of the Ranir/DCP Corporation of Orange, N.J., a company that makes generic dental products sold under the names of chain stores and pharmacies. The company has shipped 250,000 brushes under its own name and store labels since Labor Day, he said.</p>
        <p>The brush has other uses. "It makes a fine utility brush and is super for cleaning golf balls," Dr. Lewkowicz said.</p>
        <p>Patent 5,465,449 was assigned to Ranir/DCP.</p>
        <p>Keyboards For Kids</p>
        <p>Computer keyboards for children these days come in all shapes and colors. "There are a lot out there," said Richard Kuhlenschmidt, a former art dealer who has just patented a keyboard. "But they are either adult keyboards with color randomly added or they are proprietary to a certain game and can't be used for anything else."</p>
        <p>His keyboard is the same size and layout as most adult keyboards but the keys themselves are 50 percent larger and the letters and numbers are written in a big bold typeface that fills much of the surface of a given key. Letter keys are bright yellow, number keys red, function keys green, and all other keys blue.</p>
        <p>"I picked the colors so there would be as much contrast as possible so kids could distinguish between different types of keys," Mr. Kuhlenschmidt said. "The larger surface area of the keys makes it easier for a child to hit the right one."</p>
        <p>Mr. Kuhlenschmidt has replaced the number pad of the keyboard with an enlarged, square cursor pad split into four triangles, each with an arrow pointing in the appropriate direction.</p>
        <p>"Most cursor keys are just not intuitive, and this is," he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kuhlenschmidt, who is trying to license his invention, received patent 5,452,960.</p>
        <p>Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and Trademark Office,  Washington, D.C. 20231.</p>
