        <p>I never thought I would travel  for snow  especially since I don't ski -- but after a brown December and a run of January days in the uncanny 60's, I fled the city for this state where winter comes with a money-back guarantee. By now the temperature in New York has finally dipped below freezing, but that's hardly a proper, hood-up cold wave. And 10 months without a flurry makes the very pavement seem doleful.</p>
        <p>I can't take solace in memories of last winter's accumulation, which was so meager that I never even got to wear my L. L. Bean boots. They sat in the closet like a totem of some long extinguished culture, practically a work of folk art, evoking the sadness I associate with global warming. It's a feeling that can't be grasped except in small things: odd funguses on familiar trees, celestial colors that rightly belong in Adobe Photoshop, and a permanently stuffed nose in winter -- my allergy clock gone haywire. Worse than the serial sneezing is the chronic sensation that the world I know is missing from the world I see.</p>

        <p>I never thought I would travel  for snow  especially since I don't ski -- but after a brown December and a run of January days in the uncanny 60's, I fled the city for this state where winter comes with a money-back guarantee. By now the temperature in New York has finally dipped below freezing, but that's hardly a proper, hood-up cold wave. And 10 months without a flurry makes the very pavement seem doleful.</p>
        <p>I can't take solace in memories of last winter's accumulation, which was so meager that I never even got to wear my L. L. Bean boots. They sat in the closet like a totem of some long extinguished culture, practically a work of folk art, evoking the sadness I associate with global warming. It's a feeling that can't be grasped except in small things: odd funguses on familiar trees, celestial colors that rightly belong in Adobe Photoshop, and a permanently stuffed nose in winter -- my allergy clock gone haywire. Worse than the serial sneezing is the chronic sensation that the world I know is missing from the world I see.</p>
        <p>I realize it will snow eventually. This has been a dry winter; others will be moist enough for ''snain,'' at least. But 8 of the 10 warmest years on record have occurred in the past decade. At this rate, the white Christmas could become a figment of Fifth Avenue shop windows and holiday specials with Kathie Lee. Winter in New York may well become a season of wan sun and tepid rain, broken only rarely by what was once a common sight: huge yurts of snow piled in the middle of empty streets and turned into siege towers by kids like me.</p>
        <p>I understand why some suburbanites now pay dearly to have faux snow blown on their lawns. It's not just conspicuous consumption, but the need for continuity -- the same joy in the seasons that keeps me tethered to the Northeast when winter blossoms beckon from the South and West. Soon that ever-pink experience will be possible in New Jersey (the next Magnolia State, I fear). And in New York, where stands of sycamore delighted me as a boy, I dread the thought of kudzu.</p>
        <p>Don't console me with assurances that the climate is always changing -- I know Prospect Park was once a Popsicle. But these shifts are not supposed to occur in the blink of a lifetime. Weather is the constant that allows urban instability to seem normal. The roil of technics, the rude awakenings of style, the death of wool sweaters and their resurrection as pop-bottle fleece: all these explosions of capitalized will are made bearable by heat, cold and the inevitability that one will succeed the other, leading to a day when snow stops everything and we address each other in blizzardspeak, that special tone of awe and empathy. Without great snows, what must we do to produce this feeling of connection: watch TV?</p>
        <p>So I came to Vermont, not expecting a slalom experience; just a deep drift glinting in the moonlight would do. Yet even here in the whiteout state, I found the woods russet -- more Rothko than Grandma Moses -- and the temperature expected to break 50! I'll have to settle for the accouterments of snow. There's an Indian pudding waiting for me at an olde bed and breakfast here run by a couple from Brooklyn. I can shop till the cow tchotchkes come home, load up on grog lite and doze by a wax-log fire, dreaming of blizzards past and (if the right fronts collide over a sympathetic dew point) yet to come.</p>
        <p>Next year in Labrador.</p>
