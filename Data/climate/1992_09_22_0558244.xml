        <p>A STUDY of the flow of the ice off Antarctica's western region supports the theory that at certain times there has been sporadic, perhaps chaotic discharge of that great ice sheet, but suggests that this is unlikely to occur as a quick response to global warming.</p>
        <p>A number of analyses have indicated that in the warm period between the last two ice ages, 120,000 years ago, the oceans were 20 feet higher than they are today, and many scientists believe this was chiefly caused by the discharge of ice from west Antarctica. The new study seems to show that the ice sheet has collapsed, then reformed several times in the past million years.</p>

        <p>A STUDY of the flow of the ice off Antarctica's western region supports the theory that at certain times there has been sporadic, perhaps chaotic discharge of that great ice sheet, but suggests that this is unlikely to occur as a quick response to global warming.</p>
        <p>A number of analyses have indicated that in the warm period between the last two ice ages, 120,000 years ago, the oceans were 20 feet higher than they are today, and many scientists believe this was chiefly caused by the discharge of ice from west Antarctica. The new study seems to show that the ice sheet has collapsed, then reformed several times in the past million years.</p>
        <p>Fossils of microscopic marine life have been found beneath the west Antarctic ice 220 miles inland from where that ice becomes waterborne. Dr. Douglas R. MacAyeal of the University of Chicago, author of the study, said those oceanic organisms evolved less than a million years ago. Ice 1,000 Feet Thick</p>
        <p>The implication is that at times during that period the seas reached at least that far inland, as would occur if the ice sheet went to sea. Today the ice flows primarily into the Ross Sea, south of the Pacific Ocean, first forming a giant shelf of floating ice about 1,000 feet thick.</p>
        <p>The analysis by Dr. MacAyeal was published in the Sept. 3 issue of the British journal Nature. Much of his attention has been focused on the ice streams, or rivers of fast-flowing ice, that drain west Antarctica and feed the Ross Ice Shelf.</p>
        <p>The most important factor affecting that flow, he believes, is the nature of the glacial rubble, or till, beneath the ice. The base of the ice does not slide across the till, he says. Instead the till deforms in response to the flowing ice. He assumes that the till, filled with water and 15 to 30 feet thick, responds like a fluid to drag by the ice above it.</p>
        <p>Swift discharge of ice occurs when the till becomes easily deformable over a large area. This is not related to current climate, he said. Because the till is isolated from the atmosphere, conditions there are affected by long-term climate trends as well as the vagaries of ice-sheet history.</p>
