        <p>LEAD: The United States is prepared to quicken the tempo of negotiations for an international agreement on how to deal with global warming, the nation's chief environmental official said today.</p>
        <p>The United States is prepared to quicken the tempo of negotiations for an international agreement on how to deal with global warming, the nation's chief environmental official said today.</p>
        <p>The official, William K. Reilly, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that if other countries were ''prepared to commit to an earlier schedule, we would welcome that.''</p>
        <p>His remarks were viewed by environmental groups as a change in tone by the United States on the issue. As it now stands, negotiations on a global warming agreement are not scheduled to begin for more than a year. Several European nations have pressed for immediate action.</p>
        <p>Scientists believe that emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases lead to a gradual warming of the atmosphere by trapping solar radiation.</p>
        <p>The Bush Administration has resisted specific commitments to stabilize or reduce emissions of carbon dioxide until more is known about the effect.</p>
        <p>The Bush Administration has been criticized by some members of Congress and environmental groups for moving too slowly on global warming. Holding a Statement Down</p>
        <p>The attacks reached a peak two weeks ago after American representatives exerted pressure on other countries to water down a communique of environmental ministers that would have committed the United States to stabilizing emissions of carbon dioxide by 2000. Mr. Reilly said today that the United States was still committed to following a United Nations-sponsored panel on climate change. That group is not expected to begin talks on a global climate agreement until the end of 1990, at the earliest. But if participants gathering next February in Washington for a major meeting of the group agree to quicker action, the United States would join in, he said. No Change, He Says</p>
        <p>Later, Mr. Reilly said in an interview that his comments to the committee did not represent a change in United States policy. But representatives of environmental groups said the remarks suggested for the first time an American willingness to move more quickly.</p>
        <p>''It's a change in slant from putting on the brakes to saying maybe we should start doing something about it,'' said Peter Miller, an energy analyst for the Environmental Defense Fund.</p>
        <p>During questioning by the committee chairman, Senator Claiborne Pell, Democrat of Rhode Island, Mr. Reilly also publicly confirmed that there had been disagreement in the White House about whether he should have attended the environmental ministers conference on climate change in the Netherlands two weeks ago. Timetables and Commitment</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly said concern had been voiced about early drafts of the conference communique that would have committed the United States to timetables for stabilization and reduction of carbon dioxide levels. Mr. Reilly said Administration officials had considered sending a lower-level delegation to the talks to send a message that the United States would not accept such commitments.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly reportedly favored a greater commitment than the Administration was willing to offer. Eventually, he said, the United States accepted a provision stating that stabilization of carbon dioxide emissions should be achieved ''as soon as possible.'' Mr. Reilly said today that language represented a ''new commitment.''</p>
