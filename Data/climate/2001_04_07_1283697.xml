        <p>Under fire for a Bush administration seen as hostile to the environment, Christie Whitman, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, issued a plea for patience today, saying critics had been too quick to denounce early decisions.</p>
        <p>On global warming and arsenic in drinking water, the two areas in which reversals by the White House have attracted the most criticism, Mrs. Whitman said the administration was working hard to develop better, more balanced policies than those that had been set aside.</p>
        <p>But in her first address to a major environmental organization, Mrs. Whitman met with considerable skepticism. After she left the podium, the head of the National Wildlife Federation, which has a bipartisan, middle-of-the-road reputation, appealed to her ''to call a truce in what is beginning to look like a war on the environment.''</p>
        <p>''We can't stand idly by and watch what is beginning to look like a cascade of efforts to roll back progress on the environment,'' said Mark Van Putten, the president of the wildlife federation, which had not joined other environmental groups in their criticism of the administration.</p>
        <p>The tense exchange at a hotel here came as the administration was facing sharper criticism from other environmental groups, one of which has already called for Mrs. Whitman's resignation, and from Congressional Democrats who have urged the White House to reconsider many of its early environmental actions.</p>
        <p>The environmental group that has called for Mrs. Whitman's resignation is Friends of the Earth, which endorsed former Vice President Al Gore last fall. The organization said Mrs. Whitman's defense of the administration positions cost her any credibility as a moderate.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman, the former New Jersey governor, had advised the White House against its decision to come out against the Kyoto treaty on global warming. But in her address today, and in comments to reporters afterward, she assumed the role of a committed loyalist, saying she ''obviously'' did not agree with Mr. Van Putten's characterization and offering the most extensive defense to date of the administration's environmental policy making.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman told reporters that critics had been exaggerating the impact of ''one or two decisions that people might disagree with'' while minimizing others generally seen as more favorable to the environment. One of those decisions left in place a Clinton administration rule forcing drastic reductions in emissions of pollutants by buses and big trucks, even though that action had been opposed by the oil industry.</p>
        <p>On arsenic, on which the Bush administration abandoned a strict drinking-water standard approved by the Clinton administration, Mrs. Whitman said for the first time that ''there's a very good likelihood'' that  a review now under way might result in a recommendation of an even tougher standard.</p>
        <p>On global warming, Mrs. Whitman elaborated on earlier defenses of the administration's decisions to set aside the Kyoto treaty and to reverse a campaign promise to regulate power plants' emissions of carbon dioxide. Both actions have been criticized within the United States and abroad.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman said President Bush ''wants to be proactive on the issue; he wants to move forward.''</p>
        <p>''But I think you'll agree,'' she said, ''that we are better off moving forward than fighting battles we may have already lost.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman's comment was an allusion to the strong sentiment against the Kyoto accord that the Senate expressed in 1997, even before the treaty was signed.</p>
        <p>In place of the treaty's approach, which would have required the United States and other industrialized countries to meet strict standards for reductions of emissions of heat-trapping gases, Mrs. Whitman said the administration was seeking to develop an alternative that would emphasize ''technology, market-based incentives and other innovative approaches.''</p>
        <p>Outside the room where Mrs. Whitman spoke, the National Wildlife Federation had posted signs calling the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska ''too wild to drill,'' a rallying cry in opposition to another administration policy.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman did not explicitly defend the administration's effort to win Congressional approval for oil drilling in the refuge. But she did express frustration at the difficulty the administration faced in coming up with new supplies of energy.</p>
        <p>''Nobody wants to drill for oil because of what that might do to the environment,'' Mrs. Whitman told reporters. ''No one wants oil transmission pipelines because they blow up. No one want to talk about nuclear energy. And even windmills kill birds because they're in the flyway.''</p>
        <p>The administration is facing deadlines that could force decisions on other environmental issues.</p>
        <p>By April 17, it must decide whether to leave in place a Clinton administration rule that would sharply lower the threshold for companies that must make public details about their emissions of lead, which can cause severe health problems.</p>
        <p>Other policies under review include a reassessment of regulations on dioxin and a plan, approved but not put into effect by the Clinton administration, to regulate emissions of mercury from power plants.</p>
