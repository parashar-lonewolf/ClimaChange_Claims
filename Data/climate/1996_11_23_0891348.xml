        <p>With Secret Service counter-assault teams poised to stave off stray sharks, President Clinton plunged into the sparkling blue-green waters of the Great Barrier Reef today, snorkeling his way past legions of iridescent fish, marveling at a giant clam and emerging unscathed.</p>
        <p>With his wife, Hillary, Mr. Clinton spent about an hour inspecting the  giant coral reef, then climbed onto a diving platform anchored in the Coral Sea to pronounce the experience an ''unforgettable day,'' a White House aide said later.</p>
        <p>Wearing blue and green bathing trunks and white T-shirt, and wielding an underwater Instamatic camera, Mr. Clinton bobbed around the Agincourt Reef, conducting what amounted to a personal tour of the ecosystem he had celebrated hours earlier on shore. In a brief speech he pleaded for greater protection of endangered reefs worldwide.</p>
        <p>Reporters were kept well away from the President's 148-foot high-speed wave-piercing catamaran, the Quicksilver VIII, and he declined to comment as he docked tonight. But White House aides who were aboard, along with a delegation of Australian officials, described Mr. Clinton as ebullient, and painted a slightly surreal scene of the Commander in Chief ringed by masked and finned bodyguards and protected by an Australian naval vessel.</p>
        <p>In honor of Mr. Clinton's visit, the Australian authorities announced that they were renaming a section of the reef, No. 15092, in honor of the pioneering American environmentalist Rachel Carson. For his part, Mr. Clinton pledged continued support for the International Coral Reef Initiative, founded in 1994 by Australia, the United States and six other nations to foster preservation of reefs endangered by pollution, over-fishing and other unsound uses.</p>
        <p>Coral reefs around the world are deteriorating rapidly, and some experts estimate that as many as 10 percent may have already been degraded beyond recovery. The Great Barrier Reef stretches 240 miles along the Queensland coast.</p>
        <p>''We are citizens not only of individual nations but of this small and fragile planet,'' Mr. Clinton told a crowd in Rex Smeal Park here. He cited a range of environmental threats, from depletion of the ozone layer and global warming caused by auto emissions and other pollution.</p>
        <p>The President offered no specific proposals, and his remarks were intended fully as much for United States consumption as for here.</p>
        <p>But at the summit conference of 18 Asian-Pacific nations he is to attend in Manila this weekend, one of Washington's goals will be encouraging greater agreement among nations on ways to protect the Pacific Ocean.</p>
