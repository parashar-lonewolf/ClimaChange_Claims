        <p>Planting a tree may seem like a simple act, but can often be much more, especially in the Katrina and Rita-torn Gulf region.</p>

        <p>PLANTING a tree may seem like a simple act, but its benefits are complex.</p>
        <p>Beyond the usual effects -- providing shade, reducing erosion and the like -- replacing trees destroyed by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita along the Gulf Coast will have another, less tangible impact, said Joe Baucum, the volunteer president of the Louisiana Urban Forest Council and a retired health administrator.</p>
        <p>''When people came back, they were devastated by the loss of landmarks and familiar landscapes,'' he said. ''Planting will bring a semblance of normality, a sense of harmony and home and security. I expect it'll have a major impact on the psychology of the area.''</p>
        <p>The New Orleans-area organization Friends of Jefferson the Beautiful, which is also led by Mr. Baucum, expects to work with public agencies to plant some 1,300 oaks, red swamp maple, crepe myrtle and other species this fall on public property in Jefferson Parish, west of the city. The group had to wait a year for the debris to be cleared and for consensus on where to plant first.</p>
        <p>Their efforts were supported, in part, by a $15,000 grant from American Forests (americanforests.org), which also awarded grants to three other groups working on restoring Gulf Coast trees. American Forests, founded in 1875 and based in Washington, is committed to planting trees both for general environmental purposes and after natural disasters, whether floods, hurricanes or wildfires.</p>
        <p>The group funnels about $3 million in grants yearly to organizations planting trees on public lands in the United States, and spends about 10 percent of its budget on international projects. American Forests has 25,000 members, who provide a third of its financial support; the rest comes from corporate donations and foundation and government sources.</p>
        <p>The combined momentum of the national beautification program undertaken in the 1960s and the modern environmental movement of the early 1970s helped create local and regional organizations responsible for planting -- and just as important, maintaining -- trees. Several Web sites, including treelink.org and actrees.org, list groups active around the country.</p>
        <p>One of the oldest and most innovative groups, TreePeople (treepeople.org), was founded more than 30 years ago in Los Angeles and has planted two million trees on school campuses, street medians and in the mountains above the city.</p>
        <p>Other groups built on similar principles include Casey Trees in Washington; the Cross Timbers Urban Forestry Council in Fort Worth; Neighborwoods in Rochester, Minn.; and the Massachusetts Urban Forestry Council in Boston.</p>
        <p>Andy Lipkis, founder of TreePeople, emphasized that planting trees in densely populated areas could be a waste of resources unless they receive follow-up attention, which also requires financial support. ''Every time the money goes away, trees we've planted die,'' he said. ''Trees planted in cities tend not to live by themselves. People need to determine whether their local group has a maintenance program.''</p>
        <p>Some local tree-planting organizations have taken on special missions. The Fruit Tree Planting Foundation (ftpf.org), started in Mill Valley, Calif., in 2002 by the raw food advocate and author David Wolfe, is dedicated to planting orchards in places where they can serve poor populations, either as a food source or as a catalyst for educational programs or both.</p>
        <p>The foundation has financed projects in India, in Pennsylvania (at an animal sanctuary) and in Southern California (at drug rehabilitation centers and an American Indian reservation). Two months ago, the group planted 32 trees, including orange, lemon, peach, guava and mulberry, adjacent to two elementary schools in the National School District in National City, Calif., just north of the Mexican border.</p>
        <p>Clint Taylor, who coordinates before- and after-school programs for the district, said the children were being taught to care for the three-year-old trees, which will begin to bear fruit in a couple of years. He said the district planned to incorporate the orchard into a nutritional program to help the school's primarily Hispanic students develop better eating habits.</p>
        <p>''These are urban children who live in an extremely poor area and don't get exposed to gardening or fruit trees,'' Mr. Taylor said. ''They'll have an opportunity to harvest the fruit, donate it to food banks or homeless shelters or use it for in-school fund-raising.''</p>
        <p>The actual price tag of planting a tree can vary greatly depending on its location and continuing needs. A donation of as little as $1 can cover the cost of a seedling in a bulk planting in wilder areas, said American Forests' executive director, Deborah Gangloff.</p>
        <p>American Forests helps pay for that kind of planting annually in the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge in southern Texas. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service supervises the reforestation of cleared farmland bought by the federal government to increase the amount of protected land along the river.</p>
        <p>In late October, 800 volunteers helped refuge staff members plant 14,000 ebony, mesquite and other seedlings on a 50-acre field in southwestern Hidalgo County. More than 130,000 seedlings have been planted in the refuge over the last 15 years. The wooded areas provide a vital habitat for native birds and wildcats like the ocelot.</p>
        <p>Humberto Rodriguez, the park ranger who coordinated this year's planting, said the former private landowners who sold to the government often stayed in residence to help nurse the seedlings through the first year. ''Then we let Mother Nature take its course,'' Mr. Rodriguez said. ''We've had a tremendous survival rate.''</p>
        <p>As for the other end of the cost spectrum, Mr. Lipkis cautioned that the true cost of planting a tree in an urban setting can easily run to more than $100, including its early care. Trees planted in cities must be more mature than in natural areas, with thicker trunks -- the general rule is a 1 1/2- inch minimum diameter at the base -- so it can thrive in harsher conditions posed by impure air, water and soil. But, he said, ''You get a lot of climate change bang for your buck with an urban tree.''</p>
        <p>Corporate support for tree-planting organizations has increased in recent years, administrators say. Ikea and Coleman Natural Foods are among several companies working with American Forests, while Home Depot is one of TreePeople's partners.</p>
        <p>But the groups still rely heavily on individual donors, and build campaigns to appeal to them. TreePeople runs an annual holiday dedication program in which contributors can plant a single tree for $25 or a grove of five trees for $100 in honor of a loved one. American Forests sells trees descended from pin oaks and weeping willows at Elvis Presley's estate at Graceland, and ginkgos grown from cuttings taken from a tree that stood in front of Frank Lloyd Wright's historic home in Oak Park, Ill. The organization also sponsors tree-planting projects intended to protect tigers in Siberia and monarch butterflies in Mexico.</p>
        <p>''We often joke that trees don't have eyeballs, but the species they support do,'' Ms. Gangloff said. ''We want to help everyone relate to trees.''</p>
