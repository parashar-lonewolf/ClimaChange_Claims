        <p>ALARMED by exploding rates of skin cancer and especially of deadly melanomas, a coalition of health, environmental and consumer organizations has taken its message about sun protection to the movies.

        <p>The coalition, called Partners for Sun Protection Awareness, worked with the National Weather Service to introduce the UV Index on an experimental basis last summer. The service has declared the index a success and this year expanded its distribution to 160 cities, where daily predictions about ultraviolet exposure accompany the weather report in newspapers and on radio and television.

        <p>Ultraviolet, or UV, light is one of many things in life that are best taken in small doses. A little UV helps the body make vitamin D; too much can cause painful sunburn and skin damage and eventually result in skin cancers, premature aging and wrinkling of the skin and cataracts.</p>

        <p>ALARMED by exploding rates of skin cancer and especially of deadly melanomas, a coalition of health, environmental and consumer organizations has taken its message about sun protection to the movies. Along with movie trailers and sales pitches for popcorn, candy and soft drinks, many viewers of feature films this summer will see a 40-second spot teaching them about the "UV Index" and how to prevent hazardous overexposure to the sun.</p>
        <p>The coalition, called Partners for Sun Protection Awareness, worked with the National Weather Service to introduce the UV Index on an experimental basis last summer. The service has declared the index a success and this year expanded its distribution to 160 cities, where daily predictions about ultraviolet exposure accompany the weather report in newspapers and on radio and television. Schering-Plough HealthCare Products Inc., the maker of Coppertone sunscreens, has teamed up with the Orbital Sciences Corporation, a private weather forecasting company, to bring daily UV Index reports to 527 more cities, towns and resorts nationwide. What Is the UV Index?</p>
        <p>Ultraviolet, or UV, light is one of many things in life that are best taken in small doses. A little UV helps the body make vitamin D; too much can cause painful sunburn and skin damage and eventually result in skin cancers, premature aging and wrinkling of the skin and cataracts.</p>
        <p>Ultraviolet radiation, the short, invisible rays from the sun, reaches the earth's surface in varying amounts, depending on the time of year, distance from the Equator, altitude, time of day and extent of cloud cover. In recent years, another factor has entered the picture: thinning of the ozone layer, the layer of gas in the stratosphere that blocks much of the UV light, keeping it from hitting the earth's surface.</p>
        <p>There are three bands of UV radiation. UVA, which penetrates deeply into the skin's layers, contributes to premature aging and wrinkling of the skin, as well as to sunburn and skin cancer. It is not absorbed by ozone and reaches the earth at a relatively constant intensity all year. UVB radiation, which is stronger than UVA, is more intense in summer, at high altitudes and near the Equator. It is the most common cause of sunburn and a cause of cataracts and also contributes to all the problems associated with UVA. The third type, UVC, is the strongest and most dangerous but normally does not reach the earth's surface because it is filtered out by ozone.</p>
        <p>Ultraviolet radiation is most intense in the middle of a summer day when skies are clear. It is more intense near the Equator and at high altitudes. While heavy cloud cover on an overcast day blocks much of the radiation, a light cloud layer does little to reduce it. People are exposed not only to ultraviolet radiation coming directly from the sun but also to indirect rays reflected from sand, sidewalks and road surfaces, water, ice and snow. The more rays reaching the skin directly, for instance when a person is lying down rather than standing, the greater the damage.</p>
        <p>The National Weather Service, in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, created the UV Index, a daily computerized forecast of UV exposure based on location and cloud cover predictions, for cities throughout the country. Readings are generally valid for a radius of about 30 miles around each city.</p>
        <p>The index is calculated to reflect how long it would take a typical fair-skinned American (the type who sometimes tans but usually burns) to get sunburned during an unprotected stint in the noonday sun. The index also suggests what protection is needed to prevent burning -- from sunglasses and sunscreen (not less than SPF 15) for days when the UV level is minimal or low to sunglasses, sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher), protective clothing and a wide-brimmed hat and shade when the UV level is high or very high.</p>
        <p>But the coalition is quick to point out that darker-skinned people are also at risk of developing UV-related health problems (it just takes a longer time for them to get into trouble) and urges everyone, even blacks, to follow the UV Index guidelines for sun protection. Despite its long association with a "healthy" look, tanning represents skin damage, even for those who always tan and never burn.</p>
        <p>Although UV exposure is most intense when the sun is shining in the middle of the day (in summer, from 10:30 A.M. to 3:30 P.M.), UV radiation reaches the ground all day long, and 80 percent of it can penetrate a light cloud cover. Do not be fooled by cool air temperature or a refreshing breeze; they do nothing to reduce the UV. And while you may never bask in the sun, experts estimate that 80 percent of UV exposure is incidental, acquired while walking around, working or playing outdoors. Protecting Yourself</p>
        <p>To prevent sun damage, start with your eyes. Everyone should wear sunglasses, even children. Look for products that have been coated to absorb 99 to 100 percent of both UVA and UVB rays as well as most blue light. Wraparound styles give the best protection. While polarizing lenses can reduce glare, they do not necessarily block UV rays adequately. Wearing sunglasses that lack UV protection is worse than wearing none at all, since dark glasses make the pupils dilate, and even more UV can enter the eye.</p>
        <p>When it comes to skin, of greatest concern are body parts that are unprotected by clothing -- face, ears, the "V" and back of the neck, bald spot on the head, back of the hands, and, on those hot summer days, arms, legs and shoulders. Dermatologists now believe that everyone should use sunscreen on exposed skin every day, even on cloudy days.</p>
        <p>Choose a product labeled "broad spectrum," one that blocks both UVA and UVB rays. Apply the sunscreen about 20 minutes before going out, reapply it every two hours and, even if the product is labeled "waterproof," reapply it after swimming or sweating heavily.</p>
        <p>Children especially need sun protection; 80 percent of life's sun exposure is said to occur by the age of 18. Babies under 6 months should never be exposed to direct sunlight, and other children should always be protected by a waterproof sunscreen with a high SPF.</p>
        <p>Covering up with clothing is helpful, though not always as effective as many think, especially if the fabric is loosely woven. If you are fair-skinned, consider wearing specially made sun-protective clothing made of a nylon-based fabric called Solumbra, which has an SPF of more than 30.</p>
        <p>Wear a wide-brimmed hat to help protect your eyes, face and neck. Staying in the shade or under a beach or deck umbrella also helps, but neither shade nor a hat is fully protective if the surface you are on reflects a fair amount of UV rays. Also, try to schedule outdoor activities in the early morning or late afternoon, when UV radiation is much less intense. Further Information</p>
        <p>The Solumbra clothing line, produced by Sun Precautions Inc. of Everett, Wash., is quite costly, but if it saves you from skin cancer, consider it a bargain. The number to obtain a catalogue or to place an order is (800) 882-7860.</p>
