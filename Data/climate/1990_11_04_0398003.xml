      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>I suggest that these blocks be used to build a number of offshore islands.  Miami Beach contains a number of man-made islands. To construct these islands, a perimeter outline was first laid down, made water-tight with cement and then filled in with earth or rocks. Why can't we construct a number of islands several miles offshore using recycled ash construction blocks? We might even consider backing up these ash blocks with nonbiodegradable garbage. We could use the interiors as garbage landfills. After an island is filled in, it can be covered with several inches of top soil. Seeds can then be sown so that trees and plants will grow.</p>
        <p>By creating these offshore islands, we can achieve several objectives.  First: We can create as many garbage landfill sites as we need, including a place to dump nonbiodegradable garbage. Second: Trees and plants purify the air by converting carbon dioxide into oxygen. This could be of help if the islands were located around large cities which contain a high percentage of impure air. Third: These islands might be used as sites on which to locate tanks of toxic chemicals.  MORRIS GOTTLIEB Forest Hills</p>
