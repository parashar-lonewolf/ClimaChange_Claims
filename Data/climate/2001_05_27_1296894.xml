        <p>Sunday Q &amp; A appears in this section weekly. Readers are invited to send in questions about national or international affairs; those selected will be answered by Times correspondents who specialize in those issues. Information about submitting questions appears below.</p>
        <p>Rising Gasoline Prices</p>
        <p>Q. Will gasoline prices hit $3 a gallon this summer?</p>
        <p>A. Neela Banerjee, a business reporter who covers the energy industry, responds:</p>
        <p>Somewhere in the United States, on some holiday when people drive a lot, some of them buying  high-octane, cleaner-burning gasoline may pay $3 a gallon. But industry analysts say that most consumers will probably be spared.</p>
        <p>Prices at the pump, after rising steeply over the last few months, seem to have eased a bit in the last two weeks. Yet those same high prices have helped attract greater supplies of fuel to the market. Refineries, which are running close to capacity, usually manage to turn about 53 percent of crude oil into gasoline. Eager to cash in on the high prices, refiners now eke out even more gasoline from each barrel of crude, and those incremental gains have added to the overall supply and helped dampen prices.</p>
        <p>Overseas refiners are eager to get a piece of the action, too, and exports to the United States of petroleum products have increased. Anecdotal evidence suggests that people may be curtailing their driving a little, as they did last summer when gasoline prices rose steeply.</p>
        <p>The country's inventories of cleaner-burning, so-called reformulated, gasoline are distressingly low. Different states require that refiners use different recipes for reformulated gasoline to reduce specific air quality problems, and this  makes it harder for an area to replenish low supplies with gasoline from another region.</p>
        <p>If gasoline does hit $3 a gallon, it could well be in places like California or the upper Midwest, where fuels are probably the hardest to replace. But even if the price of gasoline bumps against that jarring mental boundary of $3 a gallon in isolated places, most industry analysts think it will probably tumble quickly.</p>
        <p>Interracial Dating in South Africa</p>
        <p>Q. Is there more interracial dating in the new South Africa?</p>
        <p>A. Rachel Swarns, the Johannesburg bureau chief, responds:</p>
        <p>For decades, under the apartheid government, love across the color line was strictly forbidden. Interracial marriages were banned in 1949, a year after the first Afrikaner government came to power. And in 1957, Section 16 of the Immorality Act was introduced, forbidding sexual relationships between whites and nonwhites.</p>
        <p>In 1985, the ban on interracial dating was lifted, although mixed couples were still harassed because the law required blacks and whites to live in separate areas. The government reported 1,393 interracial marriages in 1987, about two percent of all marriages that year.</p>
        <p>Now, seven years after the end of apartheid, the races are mingling more than ever before.</p>
        <p>The government no longer collects statistics on the number of interracial marriages, but blacks and whites increasingly share office cubicles, suburban neighborhoods and books in integrated classrooms. Some prominent blacks like Tokyo Sexwale, the political prisoner turned businessman, and Tumi Makgabo, a local news anchor who now works for CNN, are married to whites. And ''Isidingo,'' one of the country's popular local soap operas, features an interracial couple.</p>
        <p>But with most blacks and whites still living in separate communities, even interracial friendships remain quite uncommon. And while interracial couples are no longer head-turning oddities in big cities, they are rarely visible in restaurants, shopping malls or movie theaters.</p>
        <p>It would be among students at Sandringham High School in Johannesburg, which is 30 percent black and 70 percent white, that one might expect interracial relationships to develop. But when a group of white and black girls was asked by The Times whether they knew of any interracial couples at school, they all shook their heads, startled by the question. They said such relationships -- particularly public relationships -- were still unimaginable.</p>
        <p>Global Warming and Rising Seas</p>
        <p>Q. If global warming causes the seas to rise, which parts of the United States would be most affected?</p>
        <p>A. Cornelia Dean, science editor of The Times, responds:</p>
        <p>If the earth is warming, and most scientists believe it is, sea level will rise, first because warm  water occupies more space than cold water and second because melting water from inland glaciers and ice sheets will flow to the seas. But the resulting inundation -- what geologists call relative sea level rise -- will be different on the West, East and Gulf Coasts.</p>
        <p>On the West Coast, the Pacific plate is sliding under the North American plate, pushing it up slightly, reducing the relative sea level rise somewhat.</p>
        <p>Land in the Northeast bounced up slightly after glaciers retreated about 12,000 years ago; now it is sinking again. This sinking increases the relative sea level rise there.</p>
        <p>Much of the Gulf Coast is built of river sediments, which consolidate and subside over time, increasing the relative sea level rise. Drilling for oil, gas and even water has increased this subsidence.</p>
        <p>Geologists estimate that 70 to 90 percent of the East, West and Gulf Coasts is already eroding. As sea level rises, this erosion can only get worse.</p>
