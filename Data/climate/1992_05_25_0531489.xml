        <p>TUESDAY, MAY 26, 1992 The Economy</p>
        <p>The Bush Administration is promoting enterprise zones as the centerpiece of its plan to revive inner cities, but the zones that have sprouted under state programs have made only a slight dent in urban blight. Still, after a decade of criticizing the White House for neglecting the cities, many state and local officials and urban experts applaud the Administration's proposal, saying every little bit will help.

        <p>TUESDAY, MAY 26, 1992 The Economy</p>
        <p>The Bush Administration is promoting enterprise zones as the centerpiece of its plan to revive inner cities, but the zones that have sprouted under state programs have made only a slight dent in urban blight. Still, after a decade of criticizing the White House for neglecting the cities, many state and local officials and urban experts applaud the Administration's proposal, saying every little bit will help.

        <p>Orders for U.S. machine tools fell 9.4 percent in April as orders from foreign customers sagged, according to the monthly report of an industry trade association. But orders rose from a year earlier, leading some analysts and executives to predict increased spending to modernize factories.  [ 35. ]</p>
        <p>A web of zealously guarded beliefs and policies sets the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers apart from other unions. Critics say the U.E. is a relic, but admirers see it as a model for reinvigorating the labor movement by hewing to old-time principles under which workers fared better than they do today.

        <p>Just as New York was about to exhaust the last of its available transportation money, the state will soon begin receiving almost $16 billion in transportation funds. A tough political fight is breaking out in Albany over how to spend it.  [ 21. ]</p>
        <p>Columbia University has suffered many uncomfortable moments in this year of hard times. At commencement, a flyer given out by angry students protested the adminstration's moves to limit student financial aid and make other cuts to help close a $50 million budget shortfall.

        <p>The scientists who will gather next month in Rio de Janeiro at the United Nations Earth Summit say action is needed now to limit global warming. Their science may be right, but their timing could not be worse. Burning less fuel to cut carbon emissions will be extremely difficult because fuel prices are now so low.  [ 35. ]</p>
        <p>China's economic revolution may be dotting the countryside with new factories and electricity plants, but it is also having an unintended effect: China is contributing to global warming faster than any other large country, and there seems to be little awareness of the problem.

        <p>The French Government named a new chairman for Renault, selecting the managing director, Louis Schweitzer, to succeed Raymond Levy as head of the state-controlled auto maker. Mr. Levy will turn 65 next month, the mandatory retirement age.  [ 35. ] The Media Business</p>
        <p>Turner Broadcasting has created the Checkout Channel, a network of supermarket television monitors that display snippets of news, fashion tips, weather reports and advertisements to shoppers waiting to pay for their groceries. NBC, ABC and Whittle Communications are exploring similar ventures. These ventures are expected to give The National Enquirer serious competition for the attention of waiting grocery shoppers.

        <p>Growth came steadily over the last decade to Mendoza, Dillon &amp; Asociados, the nation's largest Hispanic advertising agency. But now it and other Hispanic agencies are confronting a problem born of their own success: there are no longer many new big clients that are not already advertising in Spanish.  [ 37. ]</p>
        <p>Genre and Out are trying to prove that gay publications can succeed without the sexually explicit ads that have repelled many major advertisers. But The Advocate, the oldest and largest gay magazine, will keep personal ads in a saddle-stitched section that must be pulled out of the magazine to be read. Advertisers are also reacting favorably to The Advocate's redesign, particularly its switch from newsprint to glossy paper. Deirdre Carmody: Magazine Notes.  [ 37. ]</p>
        <p>Thousands of bookstore owners, managers and sales people are attending the annual American Booksellers Association convention in Anaheim, Calif., where they are previewing the books that will be published this fall and next year.  [ 37. ]</p>
