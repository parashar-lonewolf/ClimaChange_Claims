        <p>LEAD: DOTTED with monuments from a 19th century rubber boom, this Amazonian river capital eagerly looks forward to a new boom: ecological tourism.</p>
        <p>DOTTED with monuments from a 19th century rubber boom, this Amazonian river capital eagerly looks forward to a new boom: ecological tourism.</p>
        <p>Worldwide concern over the Amazon rain forest is reaching this remote city, bringing waves of American and European tourists and fueling $150 million of new hotel construction.</p>
        <p>''In the 1990's, tourism will emerge as the largest single source of income in Amazonas state,'' Romulo Jose de Paula Nunes, president of the state tourism agency, predicted in a recent interview here.</p>
        <p>Gaining popularity among Americans and Europeans, ''ecotourism'' gives third world countries economic returns for preserving nature. Birding, Hiking, Sightseeing</p>
        <p>''Ecotourism is protecting the natural resources by stressing the tourism value of those resources over their exploitation or other development,'' said John Kusler, American coordinator of the Ecotourism and Resource Conservation Project.</p>
        <p>Ecological tourism includes birding, hiking, sightseeing and visits to cultural sights. Several examples from third world countries were cited at a workshop held by the Ecotourism Project last April in Mexico.</p>
        <p>In Belize, Central America concern for tourism prompted the government to create aquatic parks along coral reefs and to set aside a forest park to protect black panthers. New hotels in the interior are often of rustic design, resembling native villages.</p>
        <p>In Africa, Kenya recently proposed a complete halt to world trade in ivory. Some Kenyans have profited from ivory sales, but officials evidently calculated that elephants are worth more alive than dead. In the last two years, tourism jumped ahead of coffee and tea to become the largest source of foreign exchange for the East African nation. Business Is Booming</p>
        <p>''Many of these countries considered environmental considerations a luxury of rich nations,'' said Arthur Heyman, of the development office of the Organization of American States. ''Now they can't afford not to be conscientious about protecting their environment. If that goes, then tourism follows.''</p>
        <p>It is not known how many ''ecotourists'' travel every year. But tour operators say business is booming.</p>
        <p>''Trips that used to sell out at the last minute now sell out months in the advance,'' said Victor Emanuel of Victor Emanuel Tours of Austin, Texas. ''More often than not, we have to organize a second group.''</p>
        <p>In Brazil, tourism is creating a local economic lobby in favor of protecting the Amazon, the world's largest rain forest.</p>
        <p>On a recent morning, a Manaus tour boat, the Uruna, nosed through the silt-laden waters of an Amazonian tributary. Watching the lush riverbank foliage slip by, Dionisio Borghi, the boat owner, spoke of the growing economic argument in favor of greenery. 'You Hear Chainsaws'</p>
        <p>''You take tourists up a new part of the river, and all of a sudden you hear two chainsaws around the bend,'' he said ''The tourists see the trees cut down and then they turn to me and say, 'Why are you taking me here?' Eventually, there is going to be a conflict. Both the tour operator and the lumberman have to survive.''</p>
        <p>In June, the governor of Amazonas state announced that he would resume a controversial policy of distributing free chainsaws to jungle settlers. The state accounts for one third of the 1.9-million-square-mile area that Brazilians call ''legal Amazonia.''</p>
        <p>Although still small, Amazonian tourism runs counter to chainsaw development.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the growing worldwide interest in ecological tourism may be most visible in Manaus, a state capital of one million people reachable by a five-hour airplane flight from Miami.</p>
        <p>The number of foreign tourists arriving in Manaus increased to 70,000 in 1988, from 12,000 in 1983. In a decade, the number should hit 200,000, Mr. Nunes of the state tourism agency, said. Jungle Tours</p>
        <p>A recent edition of the city's bilingual Portuguese-English tourist guide listed 13 companies offering tours of the surrounding jungle, including Amazon Odyssey Tours, Amazon Safari Camp, Amazon Village and Jungle Trips.</p>
        <p>Fears about global warming seem to be prompting some tourists to visit the Amazon.</p>
        <p>''It's almost paradoxical,'' Senator Dale Bumpers, an Arkansas Democrat, said after a recent two-day Congressional fact-finding visit here. ''The more the greenhouse effect makes the front page, the more tourism increases.'' Deforestation of the Amazon, among other things, is thought to increase carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and accelerate global warming.</p>
        <p>''In Amazonas state, hotels are now getting the tax incentives that 10 years ago went to cattle ranches,'' said Thomas Lovejoy, an American ecologist with more than 20 years' experience in the Amazon.</p>
        <p>Long the preserve of jungle lodges slung with hammocks and of rustic riverboats in the style of the African Queen, Amazonian tourism is expanding into large-scale luxury operations run by multinational corporations.</p>
        <p>During the 1988-1989 winter season, 21 Caribbean cruise ships anchored here, up from one in the 1982-1983 season. Eying the projected tripling of luxury hotel rooms here, Eastern Airlines, a subsidiary of the Texas Air Corporation, recently acquired rights to serve Manaus from the United States. A 330-Room Hotel</p>
        <p>The Sheraton Coroporation, a subsidiary of the I.T.T. Corporation,in conjunction with a local Brazilian partner, is building a 330-room hotel here. Hilton Hotels Corporation has also shown interest in building here, Mr. Nunes said.</p>
        <p>Henry Maksoud, the owner of one of Sao Paulo's most opulent hotels, the Maksoud Plaza, explained in a recent interview why he decided to build his second hotel in Manaus.</p>
        <p>''The idea is to show the world that there is nothing in the world like the Amazon,'' he said of the 350-room Maksoud Manaus which is to open in 1992. ''There is nothing like the size of those rivers, those forests. This is the last frontier of tourism.'' 'It May Get Out of Hand'</p>
        <p>Advocates of ecological tourism caution that too much tourist development can be counterproductive. In Manaus, two large hotels with inadequate sewage treatment have fouled a swimming beach on the Rio Negro.</p>
        <p>''If you begin to open up areas based on the ecotourism argument, it may get out of hand and you might end up destroying what you are trying to preserve,'' said Mr. Kusler of the Ecotourism Project. ''You may end up killing the goose that lays the golden egg.'' Training for Guides</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the successful melding of tourism and environmental protection depends on enlisting the support of local populations. Priority for employment should be given to local inhabitants, especially for training as guides.</p>
        <p>In Manaus, the National Institute for Amazonian Research, a government study center here, has agreed to train guides for ecological tours. The guides will learn how to bring tourists to an area without disturbing it.</p>
        <p>''Most of the time areas are ruined by people who don't know any better,'' said William Wendt of the United States National Park Service who often works with foreign park officials. ''Destruction is rarely malicious or intentional.''</p>
        <p>''Ideally, tourists leave footprints and money and only take photographs out,'' Mr. Wendt said.</p>
