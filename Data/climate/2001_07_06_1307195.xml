        <p>Thousands of acres of marshy islands in Jamaica Bay, which provide nesting and feeding areas for vast populations of birds and other wildlife, are rapidly, mysteriously vanishing.</p>
        <p>According to scientists who met recently to study the problem, the marshes, which are crucial to wildlife and to the bay's ecology, will disappear in less than 20 years if a solution is not found. But at this point, scientists, who called the disappearing marshlands an emergency, do not know what is causing such rapid erosion, which seems to be unknown elsewhere in the New York metropolitan region and rare anyplace.</p>
        <p>''We started noticing that the marshes were deteriorating and receding five or six years ago,'' said Dan Mundy, a retiree who is president of a local environmental group for Jamaica Bay. ''The second year, we came back and thought it would be better, but it was worse. The third year, it was even worse.''</p>
        <p>Jamaica Bay, whose 10,000 acres include beaches, woods and wetlands off the Brooklyn and Queens coast, is home to one of the largest and most varied collections of fish and both migrating and nesting birds on the Eastern Seaboard. It attracts thousands of binoculars-carrying visitors and hikers each year. Within it are Gateway National Recreation Area, one of the country's few urban national parks, and Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge, a shelter for rare and endangered birds.</p>
        <p>''It's like a water theme park for wildlife,'' said Marc A. Matsil, head of the Natural Resources Group of the city's Parks and Recreation Department. ''It's remarkably diverse.''</p>
        <p>For New Yorkers, it is a huge and precious parcel of wilderness within the city limits, so close it is accessible by subway. ''It's the only marsh of any size adjacent to such a large metropolitan area,'' said Dr. Denise Reed, a geomorphologist at the University of New Orleans and member of the scientific panel that studied the disappearing marshes. ''In other cities, you're lucky if you get a couple of acres.''</p>
        <p>The marshy islands, covering 3,400 acres, are, in the words of one scientist, ''the crux of the Jamaica Bay ecosystem.'' The marshes provide habitat and food for birds, fish and shellfish. They filter and clean the water. They provide a buffer for the winds and waves and protect communities like Broad Channel from flooding. Like wetlands across the country, the marshes have been gradually diminishing in the past 100 years, according to scientists.</p>
        <p>But lately, the Jamaica Bay island marshes have been disappearing much more quickly, and the rate seems to be increasing each year. The tall grasses and vegetation have been dying, along with the ribbed mussels and fiddler crabs that help hold the marshes together. The peat foundations have been eroding into sediment. Marsh loss like this ''sets off alarm bells,'' Dr. Reed said. ''When we see it, we go 'Wow' and investigate.''</p>
        <p>Len Houston, an environmentalist with the Army Corps of Engineers, said: ''We don't know why they're disappearing. We don't know why it's accelerating or if it's part of a bigger cycle happening around the harbor. We need a cause before we can do anything.''</p>
        <p>For 50 years, until 1974, 10 of the islands' acres were lost each year. Between 1974 and 1995, the rate of loss more than doubled, to 26 acres a year. From 1994 to 1999, the rate nearly doubled again, with an average of 44 acres lost each year.</p>
        <p>''At this rate, within 20 years nearly all the marshes will disappear,'' said David Franz, a biology professor at Brooklyn College.</p>
        <p>What makes this especially confusing is Jamaica Bay's otherwise glowing state of health. In the 1950's and 60's, development and abuse had turned much of the bay into ''a smelly swamp,'' with diminishing numbers of birds and fish, said Arthur Gordon, an oceanography professor at Columbia University. Now, he said, thanks to stricter environmental regulations -- and despite the highways, sewage treatment plants and businesses lining the bay -- the bay is in its best condition in decades. The birds and fish are thriving, and water is being flushed out by the open ocean more efficiently than scientists once thought.</p>
        <p>''It's a vibrant and healthy biological system,'' Dr. Gordon said.</p>
        <p>The disappearance of Jamaica Bay's marshes was first noticed around 1995 by local fishermen and bird-watchers. The erosion around the edges was easy to see, but the deterioration from the inside was hidden. Among the first signs were the huge heaps of dead mussels on the marshland edges. Mussels, along with spartina grass and fiddler crabs, are essential to salt wetlands ecosystems; they filter the water and help bind the grass and peat. In recent years, they have become especially numerous.</p>
        <p>''Every place there were dead mussels, there were dead marshes,'' Mr. Mundy said. ''Where the mussels were living, the marsh was living, too.''</p>
        <p>It could be that the mussels are dying because the marshes that support them are being killed for some reason. Or it could be that both the mussels and vegetation could be dying of the same, unknown cause. Or that the piles of dead mussels might be smothering the marshes, Professor Franz said.</p>
        <p>''Their populations build up, baby mussels on top of existing mussels,'' he said. ''There are so many that it may be creating a dam effect.'' The stagnant water, he said, could be killing the grass and peat. The nutrient-loaded water from wastewater treatment plants along Jamaica Bay could be causing the mussels' explosive growth, he said.</p>
        <p>Some damage could be caused by rising sea levels, he said. But wetlands in nearby Long Island, where the sea level rises are similar, have been disappearing much more slowly, or not at all, he said.</p>
        <p>The marshland damage could also be caused by many environmental stresses created by dense development along Jamaica Bay. That includes Kennedy International Airport, and wastewater treatment plants that dump 250 million gallons a day into Jamaica Bay. That amount of wastewater, said Mr. Matsil, is ''huge, enormous -- a mega-burden of nutrients into a closed system.'' Jamaica Bay, he added, ''is like Wild Kingdom meets Dante's rings of hell.''</p>
        <p>Some of the most potentially damaging problems are huge underwater dredges, or pits, dug between 1900 and 1950 to widen the channel. The dredges trap sediment flowing in with the tides. Ordinarily, Dr. Reed said, sediment ''washes around and finds its way to the surface of the marshes.'' The fine sediment builds up the marshes and counteracts routine erosion caused, for instance, by sea level rise. ''A marsh builds up soil to keep its head above water,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Not only do the underwater pits trap sediment, they also contribute to the erosion of the bay's floor. The result is a deeper water level and higher waves, which cause further erosion by flowing over the marshes.</p>
        <p>''The plants were already not doing well,'' Dr. Reed said. ''The progressive effects of the dredging has them hanging by their fingernails. Add in the dams of mussels, and perhaps the higher waves, and it could push them over the edge.''</p>
        <p>The marshes could also be dying from pollutants: highway and asphalt runoff soaked with motor oil and diesel fuel; toxins leaching from three inactive hazardous-waste landfills; and raw sewage overflowing from wastewater treatment plants.</p>
        <p>The government is planning experiments to try to find out what is killing the marshlands, said John T. Tanecredi, chief of natural resources at Gateway National Recreation Area. It will probably try adding sediment to the islands and restoring a small marsh area. But the National Park Service has only about $150,000 to spend on the project right now, he said.</p>
        <p>''Even demonstrations cost millions,'' he said. And an ecological emergency moves more slowly than, for instance, a medical or law-enforcement one. It will probably take three to five years to uncover the problem and decide on solutions, he said.</p>
        <p>''What we can't do,'' said Paul Mankiewicz, a biophysicist at the Gaia Institute in the Bronx, an environmental organization, ''is sit back and study this for 10 years. At this rate of loss, we'd be losing the marshes soon.''</p>
