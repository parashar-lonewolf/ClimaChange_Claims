        <p>Global warming poses an uncommon threat to life on the planet, but what can ordinary people do about it? Plant a tree. This requires a shovel, a stake - in the ground and the future - and a seedling. If people live in an urban hardscape, they may want to follow the advice of Andy Lipkis, founder of a growing California organization called TreePeople, who has prompted the planting of a million trees in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Plant a tree by your apartment building, shop or school. Better yet, consider becoming a citizen forester - volunteers trained in the art of arboreal skills like getting city permits, breaking concrete and protecting young trees from vandals.</p>
        <p>In 1970, when he was 15, Andy Lipkis watched the trees in his summer camp in the San Bernardino mountains die from the smog of Los Angeles. He and a dozen other campers tore up a parking lot and created a meadow. The planting of smog-resistant trees gave his life new meaning. He obtained seedlings from the California Forestry Division and private nurseries and organized volunteers to plant and adopt trees.</p>
        <p>Planting a tree is not, ultimately, so simple, says this bearded latter-day Johnny Appleseed. Nurturing, watering and pruning require a commitment of years. President Bush has joined the effort. He talks about planting a billion trees a year, but there is no long-term commitment to maintain them.</p>
        <p>He and other politicians would be wise to note what has happened in the Olympic Forest in Los Angeles. Trees from all over the world were planted by local government with political fanfare, but little community involvement. Now many have withered.</p>
        <p>Nurturing a relationship between people and trees is the central message of TreePeople. Without people, trees die. Without trees, so will people.</p>
