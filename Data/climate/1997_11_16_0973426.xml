        <p>THOMAS R. CASTEN has been rising before the sun, the ideas flowing even before his head leaves the pillow. Position papers, a book, all are taking shape under headings like ''The Environmental Benefits of Electric Company Restructuring'' and ''Combining Production of Heat and Power.''</p>
        <p>For 20 years, the 6-foot-1 Mr. Casten, a former Marine who served in Vietnam, said he has been waiting for someone of national importance to heed his message: power plants can become doubly efficient and in the process dramatically reduce their emission of greenhouse gases by capturing waste heat and turning it into steam for heating office buildings and houses.</p>
        <p>One of the most effective and economical ways to help the environment, he said, is for electric companies to compete with one another on the open market instead of being hampered by outmoded regulations.</p>
        <p>Now, at last, someone is paying attention to what Mr. Casten has to say. That someone is the President of the United States.</p>
        <p>Mr. Casten, president of Trigen Energy Corporation here, was one of the industry leaders who gathered for a daylong White House conference on climate change held recently at Georgetown University in Washington. President Clinton engaged in intense discussion with a panel of experts, including Mr. Casten, in preparation for a 150-country meeting on global warming to be held next month in Kyoto, Japan. Negotiations for an international treaty to limit emissions of carbon dioxide are expected to culminate at the meeting, which is viewed as a first step in reducing the rate of increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Mr. Casten has shown his energy and determination in groups as diverse as the Boy Scouts, which, for his lifetime of service, named him the Distinguished Eagle Scout in Westchester and Putnam Counties this year, and the Westchester Philharmonic, which he helped start in 1983.</p>
        <p>Scientists have painted a dire picture of what will happen on earth if heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions, produced by the burning of fossil fuels, are not curtailed.</p>
        <p>''My message today is simple,'' the 55-year-old Mr. Casten told Mr. Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and other members of the audience. ''You can unleash market forces that will lower greenhouse gas emissions and reduce energy costs by opening electric markets to retail competition. America's entrepreneurs will eliminate energy waste, if given a chance to compete.'' Then he added: ''When you go to Kyoto, play to our strengths. Tell the other nations that we will unleash our entrepreneurial strength to improve power plants worldwide.''</p>
        <p>A few weeks later, at the National Geographic Society in Washington, when he heard President Clinton's address on global warming, Mr. Casten said he was gratified to hear the following: ''Here at home, we must move forward by unleashing the full power of free markets and technological innovations to meet the challenge of climate change.'' The President later presented a plan to reach the 1990 greenhouse emissions level by 2008 to 2012 with a $5 billion program of tax cuts and research and development for new technologies, incentives for companies that cut emissions early and an international-market-based emissions trading system.</p>
        <p>Never mind that the President did not quite endorse deregulation and critics contend that the Government is moving too slowly to curtail greenhouse gases, Mr. Casten said. The ball, though still on the one-yard line at the wrong end of the field, he said, is at least in motion.</p>
        <p>Trigen, a company founded by Mr. Casten and several partners in 1980, aims to cut fuel use and pollution in half by using the heat normally wasted in generating a product like electricity. The company, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, operates with a system called combined heat and power to produce electricity, steam and chilled water for cooling from one source. Trigen -- the term trigeneration, which the company coined, refers to the generation of the three products -- serves customers like the Coors brewery in Golden, Colo., the John Hancock Building in Boston, the Nassau Community College and public buildings in Nassau County and government offices and other buildings in Philadelphia, Baltimore and St. Louis, among other cities.</p>
        <p>The company, which had total revenues of $250 million last year, claims 70 percent efficiency for its fuel compared with 30 percent efficiency for most of the larger power plants in the country. What bothers Mr. Casten is that utility companies are not permitted to use the strategies and maneuvers that enable other businesses to grow and be innovative. Under current laws, utility companies lack the incentive for improvement, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Casten said he believes that market forces are the answer to the global catastrophe -- at least where the United States is concerned. He approached addressing the President like an actor who has been studying his role for a long time: he was raring to go. ''I wasn't nervous,'' Mr. Casten said in a recent interview in his office. ''I've never been so prepared for anything in my life.''</p>
        <p>Before the Georgetown conference took place, President Clinton referred to Trigen and to Mr. Casten by name in discussing efficient energy production with a group of weather forecasters. After the conference, his picture appeared in The Washington Post with Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore, and magazine editorials repeated phrases nearly verbatim from his speech. To those who know the Colorado native, his effective use of the limelight came as no surprise. He was the founding chairman of the Westchester Philharmonic, and many credit the orchestra's continued success to his firm guidance in its early years.</p>
        <p>But because recycled energy is not a widely familiar concept, Mr. Casten was not able to use his gifts for communication and persuasion in his own arena until recently, when the coming Kyoto conference forced a thorough study of the global warming issue. Now that he has the President's ear, Mr. Casten said, he is keeping a steady flow of information headed toward Washington about the benefits of deregulation. Opponents include members of the utilities industry as well as some environmentalists, who fear increased pollution if coal plants in the Middle West are allowed to make power for the Northeast.</p>
        <p>''Markets don't work that way,'' Mr. Casten said. ''Typically, an environmentalist is not somebody that really understands markets.''</p>
        <p>He referred to the dissension within the Administration about suggestions like taxing carbon -- a strategy Mr. Casten vehemently opposes -- and compared deregulating electricity with opening trade with China: it took a Republican, Richard M. Nixon, to do the latter, and it may take a Democrat, operating within a traditional Republican domain, to do the former. ''This is not a popular political issue,'' Mr. Casten said. ''This is Clinton thinking about his legacy. It is his fate to have been the President of the most powerful nation in the world when we found out, almost for the first time, that human activities had reached a scale where we were affecting the globe.''</p>
