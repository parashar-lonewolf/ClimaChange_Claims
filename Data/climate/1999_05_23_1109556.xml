        <p>MOST of this oceanfront community vanished underwater in the 1980's and 90's when harsh storms washed away 190 homes,  along with the narrow strip of sand on which they were precariously perched.</p>
        <p>But now the beach has been artificially restored with 4.5 million cubic yards of sand. Like a Lost City of Atlantis in reverse, the village is coming back. The building boom hums all along Dune Road with trucks, backhoes and pile drivers. Surveyors, work crews, architects, brokers and prospective buyers scurry around the rising frames of this Levittown for the well-to-do.</p>
        <p>With unintended irony, the signs sprouting on the lots bear names like Sea and Surf Realty and Wave Crest Builders.</p>
        <p>''We're seeing building not seen anywhere since the Gold Rush days,'' said the Mayor, Gary Vegliante. The village has 331 residential lots, and about 80 homes have been constructed since 1996. ''Within the next three years,'' he predicted, ''we'll be pretty much at a saturated level.''</p>
        <p>The Mayor spearheaded a long lawsuit to recreate the community, contending that it had suffered erosion because rock groins installed to the east blocked the normal flow of sand. Federal, state and local governments settled the case, agreeing to pay nearly $20 million for beach restoration for three decades. ''We're the only beach on the East Coast,'' he boasted, ''with a guarantee to be here for 30 years.''</p>
        <p>Some critics are horrified.</p>
        <p>''It's a disgrace, it's a moonscape there -- God, you couldn't give me that property,'' said Lorna Salzman, an environmental advocate from East Quogue. ''Eventually the houses will wash away. It has nothing to do with science. It's all totally politics, just too many people with too much money. There should be no building on the barrier islands. If houses are damaged, they should be bought or condemned. There should be no Federal flood insurance. Westhampton Dunes has collected 10 times what they paid in, to rebuild in the same place.''</p>
        <p>Ah, the Hamptons. People come here to enjoy the deceptive tranquillity of the beach, soothed as they watch the gentle waves roll in and splash a frothy kiss across the sand.</p>
        <p>But in reality the beach is a fierce combat zone, starting with its geological origins and endlessly shifting sands. Civilization introduced new contests with nature. Development pushes daringly to the water's edge. Vast sums are spent trying to hold the beach in place by dredging sand and moving boulders. And people armed with money and laws fight over who owns the beach, who is allowed to visit and what they may or may not do here.</p>
        <p>''We've lost our potato fields, and traffic is 10 times worse, but we still love it -- it's the sea and sky, and it's beautiful,'' said Gail Leddy Guillemin, a muralist from Hampton Bays who took two friends to Tiana Beach one recent weekend. ''We try to come every weekend. But this is disappearing. People continue to build, even though the houses are in danger.''</p>
        <p>Powerful natural forces created and continue to alter the slender strands along the South Shore. The beaches are formed of sand torn from Long Island's eastern tip and steadily swept westward by the currents. ''It's the slo-mo battle,'' said East Hampton Town's natural-resources director, Larry Penny. Sporadically, violent bursts of hurricanes and northeasters radically gouge and shift the shoreline.</p>
        <p>Experts debate whether humans should try to ''manage'' natural forces on the coast, and if so, how. Some people advocate pumping sand to rebuild beaches, dredging inlets and building protective groins and jetties. Others say that such measures are follies that throw money into the sea.</p>
        <p>In the struggle over development, conflicting town and village regulations allow building on some stretches of beach, but not on others. Some places allow owners to reinforce their vulnerable oceanfront property with stone, steel, concrete or wood bulkheads. Other communities forbid such intervention.</p>
        <p>''Yes, there's a war going on,'' Mr. Penny wrote in The East Hampton Star after viewing the encroaching development during a helicopter flight last month. ''It's going to engulf us all.''</p>
        <p>Another battle is over access to the beaches for outsiders who do not live here and are not on the A or even B invitation list. History and laws have drawn invisible lines in the sand, dividing ownership among New York State, Suffolk County, the towns, the villages, beach clubs and other private owners. Some beaches are open to everyone, some are for local residents and some are restricted by parking rules.</p>
        <p>''No parking anytime,'' say many signs on the narrow roads to the beaches. Small pockets of parking near beach entrances are generally posted ''Parking by permit only,'' often without a clue about which town or village issues the permit. Some residents say they have heard of early birds snaring spots early in the day, then turning them over to latecomers for $20 tips, suggesting a new acronym coinage: To Insure Parking Space.</p>
        <p>Intrepid bathers and sun worshipers who actually get to a beach often face bewildering regulations. Local officials debate and rule on which activities are allowed at which beach, in which seasons and at what times. Swimming, surfing, windsurfing, boat launching, fishing, scuba diving, snorkeling, camping, beach vehicles and fires are among the things permitted at some places at some times under certain circumstances, but not at others.</p>
        <p>Camping, for example, is allowed at a few sites -- but only in campers, not tents. Many beaches close at night, except the spots that allow campers or surf-casting in the dark. Special vehicles with permits are allowed on some beaches, but usually not when bathers are present.</p>
        <p>One baffling sign at the Napeague Lane entrance to Beach Hampton, near Amagansett, warns: ''May 15-Sept. 15, 10 A.M.-6 P.M., Dogs permitted only beyond 300 feet in either direction.'' So how are dogs supposed to get to 300 feet beyond the entrance?</p>
        <p>The beaches stir so much controversy because they are, after all, what draw people here. ''The Hamptons,'' Mr. Penny said, ''would be nothing without the beaches.''</p>
        <p>So many people are flocking to the Hamptons that the ever worsening traffic jams are provoking extreme responses. Southampton's latest master plan proposes erecting toll gates for eastbound vehicles -- and no charge for those leaving. And for those who can afford it, Gabriel Aviation offers 35-minute Manhattan-Hamptons helicopter commuting at a season rate of $5,975 for 15 weekends, about $199 each way. (Hampton Jitney's best deal works out to $17.90 each way.)</p>
        <p>The resort era began evolving in the mid- and late 1800's with the advent of the Long Island Rail Road. Boarding houses and hotels sprang up. Artists from the Tile Club in Greenwich Village, whose members included Augustus Saint-Gaudens and Winslow Homer, began visiting the East End.</p>
        <p>Today the Hamptons is a world-class playground of the rich, powerful and famous. Although summer is still the peak, more people are turning their summer houses into second homes, year-round residences and retirement homes.</p>
        <p>''There was always a summer colony here for artists and rich people that shut down for the winter, but that's not East Hampton anymore,'' said the village administrator, Larry Cantwell.</p>
        <p>The owner of Lenhart Cottages at Montauk, Ronald Weiss, said: ''The season is lengthening on both ends. People are more mobile and flexible, with faxes, modems, E-mail and everything.''</p>
        <p>The Hamptons is where Steven Spielberg makes one of his homes -- topped by a Jurassic Park-inspired weather vane in the form of a dinosaur. Last summer he was a host of the most notable event of the season: a sold-out fund-raiser for President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton, who stayed overnight.</p>
        <p>Neatly pruned hedges towering 10 or 12 feet hide many homes from curiosity seekers. But everyone knows that Wall Street moguls, Hollywood stars, artists, authors, fashion designers and other celebrities all gravitate here: Calvin Klein, Leo Castelli, Jerry Seinfeld, Paul Simon, Kathleen Turner, Richard Avedon and Donna Karan, to name but a few.</p>
        <p>They do not always get along. Martha Stewart, the perfectionist of domestic arts, has been feuding over her East Hampton boundary with the developer Harry Macklowe. Neighbors of the columnist Cindy Adams complained about her Bridgehampton home's expansion; a building inspector has issued summonses.</p>
        <p>And the construction of a huge new home for the investor Ira Rennert -- a 78,000-square-foot complex of five buildings with 25 bedrooms and 39 bathrooms -- has so infuriated his neighbors in Sagaponack that some are circulating a petition to create their own new village.</p>
        <p>The East End real estate market is flying as high as the Dow Jones average these days.</p>
        <p>''It's been a banner year, one of the best, for both sales and rentals,'' said Maureen A. Lawrence, a broker at First Hampton Realty. Sales have apparently not been hurt by a 2 percent tax that took effect April 1 on sales of homes over $250,000 and vacant land over $100,000 to finance the preservation of 25,000 acres of open space.</p>
        <p>Beach proximity is the paramount factor in prices. A small ranch on an interior road can sell for as little as $250,000. But in Southampton, a three-story home with a 1,000-foot driveway and 200 feet of oceanfront is listed at $15 million. In rentals, a four-bedroom house on four acres in Westhampton with a pool and tennis court lists at $52,000 for the season. But a bigger, better house -- and in the Hamptons there is always something bigger and better -- with eight bedrooms, marble floors, a pool, tennis court and the all-important ocean frontage, is offered at $365,000 for the summer. Just a locker at a beach club can run $2,000.</p>
        <p>For wealthy bargain hunters, there are handyman specials. ''Someone might spend $8 million for a house that needs a lot of work,'' said Mr. Cantwell, ''then spend $8 million to renovate and expand it or tear it down and build a new house.''</p>
        <p>If the stock market has been kind to the Hamptons of late, so has mother nature. The winter storm season passed without widespread damage. Southampton's Town Supervisor, Vincent J. Cannuscio, said, ''The beach is more beautiful than ever.''</p>
        <p>But there are troubling exceptions. East Hampton's village beach is relatively flat and vulnerable, Mr. Cantwell said. East Hampton's Town Supervisor, Catherine H. Lester, worries about persistent erosion of beaches at Ditch Plains and west of the Lake Montauk inlet, where ''there are houses ready to fall in.''</p>
        <p>Erosion at the Montauk bluffs has speeded up from one foot a year to two feet or more, said Mr. Penny, the natural-resources director. He suspects the causes are the rising sea level, changing weather patterns and development, including the effect of septic tanks. He said, ''We have spots, where Dick Cavett lives, for example, where it's eroding at maybe three feet a year now.''</p>
        <p>Mild winters can lull people into complacency. Experts warn that Long Islanders are long overdue for another storm like the 1938 hurricane, which inflicted widespread havoc even though the population and development were modest.</p>
        <p>''We're sitting ducks,'' Mr. Penny said. ''The '38 storm wiped out 50-foot dunes in just two or three waves. All these modern houses are built on pilings, and a big storm is going to take them down. They're probably living on borrowed time. But they don't seem to mind; they have the money.''</p>
        <p>An expensive lesson about living on the edge was impressed on the Manhattan real estate magnate William Rudin last year. To save his beach house near Mecox Bay, he first built a steel cofferdam, then tried piling sandbags 20 feet high at a cost estimated at more than $1 million. A storm promptly destroyed the defenses and damaged the house. ''After that,'' Supervisor Cannuscio said, ''he bought inland.''</p>
        <p>Other owners are undeterred. ''Mort Zuckerman, he's typical,'' Mr. Penny said of the developer and publisher of The Daily News. ''He's got every type of armament in front of his place.'' Critics fear that such devices cause more erosion to nearby beaches, and there have even been complaints of sabotage.</p>
        <p>Seeking to protect its 110 miles of coastline, East Hampton is completing a decade-long effort to adopt new regulations, coordinated with 75 government agencies. One part, imposed this year, bars waste discharges from boats. Coastal property will be restricted on septic system discharges, pesticides and fertilizers, Supervisor Lester said. The plan will also clarify where new construction is banned, whether washed-out buildings can be rebuilt and where to permit bulkheads.</p>
        <p>''We're not looking to increase structures,'' Ms. Lester said. ''We're looking to keep our coastline open and free.'' Supervisor Cannuscio said that when he started in town government in 1991, ''one of the first things I had to wrestle with was applications from landowners on Dune Road'' for bulkheads, and ''those applications are still pending.''</p>
        <p>Programs to build groins and jetties are defended by their sponsor, the Army Corps of Engineers. ''There is that argument that you can retreat and say don't fight mother nature,'' said the district project manager for coastal civil works, Clifford S. Jones. ''But we do have an obligation to protect the coastal community, especially when that coast is protecting the mainland.'' His agency is drafting a master plan, due in 2002, for the beaches from Fire Island to Montauk.</p>
        <p>Critics contend that while barrier beaches protect the mainland, natural forces only move the beach, and do not destroy it and expose the mainland to ocean waves and storms. ''That's another one of the big lies,'' said Mrs. Salzman, the environmental advocate. ''What they did to justify the cost was pretend there would be damage to the mainland. That's the biggest lie of all.''</p>
        <p>To the outsider, the Hamptons mystique can be daunting: the wealth, the celebrities, the picture-perfect homes that look like something out of a magazine and probably are. Homes here have names, like The Landmark and Three Waters. Styles range from sedate shingled traditionals to the startling moderns with their rakish angles. Gates and statues guard the entrances to some.</p>
        <p>Street names have their own cachet: Further Lane, Lily Pond Lane, Gin Lane, Highway Behind the Pond and the ever popular Private Road Do Not Enter. Minivans may reign at plebeian Jones Beach, but here the roads are a parade of sport cars, antique automobiles, limousines and other luxury transports.</p>
        <p>Although the no-parking signs at many local beaches discourage the uninitiated, visitors can get to the East End shore. One secret: go off season, when there are no crowds and scant enforcement.</p>
        <p>''It gets too expensive during prime time, so we come in the off season,'' said Kenneth Sattler of Wantagh, who was biking along the Montauk bluffs last month. His wife, Doris, said: ''We enjoy the view of the ocean and the quietness. We don't want to see it developed with shopping malls and everything.''</p>
        <p>Suffolk County's Cupsogue Beach is a good choice for the public, at least until its 1,500-car parking lot fills. With a $20 three-year Green Key pass, Suffolk residents can go free. Otherwise they pay $5 a day for parking. Nonresidents pay $8. Another option is the county park at Shinnecock, but it has no lifeguards.</p>
        <p>Rules vary more among the many town and village beaches. A guide, ''The Hamptons Book'' by Suzi Forbes Chase (Berkshire House, 1999), lists 29 beaches, and even that is not complete.</p>
        <p>''What we need is more beaches open to the general public, but we don't have that,'' Mayor Vegliante said. ''We're pretty well packed here. We couldn't safely get another person on that beach without degrading environmental quality.''</p>
        <p>Supervisor Lester of East Hampton voiced the conflict. ''Because we're a tourist-oriented economy, we don't want to exclude the people who come here. But we don't want to take a natural habitat and destroy it because there are too many people. Now the village has closed beach parking to nonresidents on weekends, and that's putting more pressure on our already overcrowded town beach. The more the population grows, the more that's going to happen.''</p>
        <p>While humans continue squabbling over the beach, they are cooperating to help two endangered species stage a tentative comeback: the least tern and the piping plover. Metal stakes with strings and bright ribbons mark nesting areas, with warning signs to keep primates out.</p>
        <p>''The birds are setting up nesting right now when there aren't many people, then on Memorial Day and the Fourth of July, the people come in droves,'' said Susan Antenen, the science director for the Nature Conservancy on Long Island. ''There has been a tremendous amount of progress in figuring out ways to protect the wildlife while allowing people to use the beach, allowing wildlife and people to coexist here.''</p>
