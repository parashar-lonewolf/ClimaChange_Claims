        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Finally, an editorial has noted a fact of extreme importance when discussing the Kyoto Protocol, heretofore ignored so far as I can recall.</p>
        <p>''America's Shame in Montreal''(editorial, Dec. 13), while denouncing the United States, also states: ''It's certainly true that without the developing nations on board, any effort to keep greenhouse gases at manageable levels will be for naught. China, for example, is building coal-fired power plants at a rapid clip and is expected to overtake the United States as the biggest producer of greenhouse gases in 20 years.''</p>
        <p>China is now the second-largest user of fossil fuel, having replaced Japan in that category. A Dec. 5 front-page article reported that ''India's middle class has grown to an estimated 250 million in the past decade'' and that ''India has become one of the world's fastest-growing car markets.''</p>
        <p>The countries that have signed the Kyoto treaty do not want to irritate China and India because of the tremendous selling opportunities those two countries provide, reminding one of Lenin's comment, ''The capitalists will sell us the rope with which we will hang them.''</p>
        <p>If China and India were to join the Kyoto Protocol, the United States would be without a legitimate argument in defense of its current position opposing mandatory emission reductions.</p>
