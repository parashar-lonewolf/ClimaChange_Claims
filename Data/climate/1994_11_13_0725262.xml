        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re " 'Emperors of Garbage' " (Op-Ed, Nov. 5): "India's plagues are self-inflicted," reads the subheadline on Inderjit Badhwar's article, which blames Government neglect for India's epidemics. Social inequities and widespread wastes provide the setting. But there is another aspect: worldwide climate changes also contributed to the plague.</p>
        <p>Last summer India's temperatures reached 124 degrees Fahrenheit, and animal carcasses were scattered across the plains. Houses, abandoned after the Maharashtra earthquake the year before, became furnaces in blasting heat; stuffed with stored grains, they generated clouds of fleas. Pneumonic plague was first reported in Beed district of Maharashtra state last August.</p>
        <p>Terrestrial heating occurs six times faster than oceanic, and hot-air columns rise, leaving low-pressure systems that draw in moisture-laden maritime air. (Southern Europe's recent deluge followed a record-breaking summer heat wave, the impact in Italy compounded by local deforestation.) This year Indian southwesterly driven monsoons lasted almost three months.</p>
        <p>Surat's Tapti river rose 12 feet above normal, it submerged houses and, in receding, left rotting animals, rubbish and rats strewn across the city. The people entering Surat in September included those from Beed, and they concentrated in the remaining dry fields during a festival. The next morning pneumonic plague broke out.</p>
        <p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, infectious diseases are emerging and resurging globally at an accelerating rate. While poverty and ecological changes create vulnerability to the outbreak and spread of disease, climate contributes to the vector redistribution, and weather anomalies afford new breeding sites and bursts of new activity for pests.</p>
        <p>Aedes aegypti mosquitoes (associated with dengue and yellow fever), once limited to 1,000 meters in altitude by temperature restrictions, have been reported in India (and Colombia) above 2,200 meters. Similar changes are occurring in Central America and in East Africa, paralleling plant movement to higher altitudes in the Alps, Alaska and Asia.</p>
        <p>These shifts may be seen as biological indicators of climate trends, as warming in the deep oceans indicates protracted heat uptake from the atmosphere. (Columbia University scientists report we are in the 50th month -- and project we will have a fifth consecutive year -- of warming in the Western Pacific. Such stagnation, warming and even expansion of the oceans is projected to generate a wet and windy winter.)</p>
        <p>Changing patterns of variability are part of climate change and suggest increasing instability in the climate system. Greenland ice cores demonstrate that instability in past eras has been associated with rapid jumps in climate.</p>
        <p>Such climate changes are testing the resilience of societies; meanwhile, they are releasing opportunistic, highly competitive pests and pathogens from ecological controls and predation in urban and rural settings. These biological side effects of global change carry enormous implications for tourism, trade and transport. To address this, we must coordinate expanded disease surveillance with other efforts to monitor the global environment.</p>
        <p>Inderjit Badhwar's call to address deteriorating social conditions is poignant, and many emerging diseases, particularly those spread person to person, directly reflect declining social conditions (witness the former Soviet Union).</p>
        <p>But anticipatory social adjustments take on greater urgency as we confront an uncertain future in our life-support systems -- systems threatened by development practices that exhaust stored carbon and living resources, and generate wastes beyond the capacity of biological systems to recycle them.</p>
        <p>Rodents and insects carry no passports. PAUL R. EPSTEIN, M.D. Cambridge, Mass., Nov. 8, 1994 The writer is a member of the Harvard School of Public Health's working group on new disease.</p>
