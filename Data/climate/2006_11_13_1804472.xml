        <p>THERE is the familiar sort of philanthropy in which the check is signed, dinner attended, building named, ribbon cut. And then there is the kind favored by Gary C. Comer until his death last month at the age of 78.</p>
        <p>Mr. Comer, a Chicago businessman who became a billionaire upon selling his Lands' End catalog business to Sears in 2002, did his share of straightforward giving, including $80 million that he and his wife, Francie, donated to the University of Chicago to help build the Comer Children's Hospital, and more than $6 million to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution on Cape Cod.</p>
        <p>But in his final four years, as he struggled with prostate cancer, Mr. Comer single-handedly energized an arcane, but important, scientific nook -- studying past instances when the earth's climate jolted abruptly, and exploring whether it could do so again in a human-warmed world.</p>
        <p>He became so involved in the work, organizing expeditions using his own planes and yacht, that last year he was listed as one of four authors on a much-cited paper, ''The Role of Seasonality in Abrupt Climate Change,'' published in 2005 in the journal Quaternary Science Reviews.</p>
        <p>The paper documented evidence that the authors found in eastern Greenland in 2003 hinting that a significant, but temporary, cooling of the Northern Hemisphere around 13,000 years ago, called the Younger Dryas, had been mainly driven by sharp temperature drops in winter, with summers hardly changing at all.</p>
        <p>That pattern strongly implied that spreading winter sea ice -- by preventing heat from escaping into the frigid air from the warmer ocean below -- was the factor responsible for the intensity of the widespread cooling.</p>
        <p>Mr. Comer's co-authors, who are veteran climate and polar experts, said there was nothing honorary about his inclusion.</p>
        <p>''He was in there working with us all the way,'' said one of the paper's authors, Wallace S. Broecker, the Newberry Professor of Geology at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University.</p>
        <p>''I may even have graduated from Glaciers 101,'' Mr. Comer said in an e-mail message shortly after the 2003 trip.</p>
        <p>Mr. Comer's focus on climate grew out of his love of the sea, particularly ice-clogged Arctic waters. He often explored the far north on Turmoil, his 151-foot trawler-style motor yacht.</p>
        <p>On a cruise in the Canadian Arctic in 2001, he pushed through the normally ice-choked Northwest Passage to the Pacific. He became concerned about the lack of ice and the warming in the region, as well as climate research projecting that a buildup of heat-trapping smokestack and tailpipe gases in the atmosphere could contribute to an Arctic meltdown of epic proportions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Comer did not have a college degree but did, family and friends say, have a gift for finding the right expert to attack a particular puzzle, whether it was inventory management or climate change.</p>
        <p>In this case, he assembled a network of more than 30 leading atmospheric and climate experts, including Dr. Broecker and F. Sherwood Rowland, a chemistry professor at the University of California at Irvine and a winner of the 1995 Nobel Prize in chemistry (for work linking synthetic chemicals to the erosion of the atmosphere's protective veil of ozone).</p>
        <p>Altogether, the Comers committed about $6 million through 2008 so that the researchers could recruit and support a small army of more than 60 Comer Fellows, young recent Ph.D. recipients studying climate change.</p>
        <p>With his newfound climate focus, Mr. Comer ferried glaciologists to remote parts of Greenland several times. His yacht essentially became the University of Turmoil, said his longtime friend Philip Conkling, president of the Island Institute in Rockport, Me.. Some reports and photographs from those trips are posted at csande.org.</p>
        <p>Mr. Comer went along for the ride, physically and intellectually. He joined the researchers in grueling inspections of geological features left behind by Greenland glaciers. He also took part in flights that took days, doing aerial surveys over hundreds of square miles of remote parts of central Canada in one of his two planes.</p>
        <p>The airborne surveys were seeking hints of a great flood of fresh water that scientists theorize could have set off the Younger Dryas cooling. The flood is thought to have emanated from Lake Agassiz, a temporary water body -- comparable in size to the Great Lakes -- that was left behind in northern North America after the last ice age ended.</p>
        <p>A surge of fresh water from the emptying lake could have blocked heat-toting currents in the Atlantic Ocean, setting off a 1,300-year-long return to ice-age-like conditions. The flights by Mr. Comer and his team found no evidence for such a supposed flood, leaving that question, for the moment, unresolved.</p>
        <p>On the flights and expeditions amid the glacial ice and barren eastern Greenland, Mr. Comer was a deeply involved participant, said George H. Denton, a professor of earth sciences at the University of Maine in Orono, who was on the flights and several other field trips organized by Mr. Comer.</p>
        <p>''He wore me out,'' said Dr. Denton, a veteran of 30 seasons in Antarctica and other grueling fieldwork. On the flights in Canada, he said, ''I was sick as a dog, bouncing all over, and Gary was camped out for two days in the back taking pictures.''</p>
        <p>In an interview published in February in the journal Science, Mr. Comer explained that his goal was to help spur scientific advances in a vital area that was treated as a backwater. But he also said that he hoped that the federal government would take over when his grants expired.</p>
        <p>''Who needs to go to the Moon?'' he told the magazine. ''Take care of Earth.''</p>
