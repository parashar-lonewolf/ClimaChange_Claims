        <p>LEAD: The White House's Council on Environmental Quality says the progress of the last two decades shows that the nation can have both economic growth and environmental quality.</p>
        <p>The White House's Council on Environmental Quality says the progress of the last two decades shows that the nation can have both economic growth and environmental quality.</p>
        <p>Michael R. Deland, chairman of the council, said in his introduction to the council's annual report, issued Tuesday: ''Over the past two decades the presumed linkage between economic growth and environmental degradation has been broken. We know now that a growing economy and a clean environment go hand in hand.'' The council is the executive branch's environmental coordinating group.</p>
        <p>The acknowledgment that environmental protection and economic progress are compatible and even mutually reinforcing is a significant departure from the views of Ronald Reagan's Administration, which frequently opposed environmental regulation on the ground that it had a dampening effect on business expansion.</p>
        <p>Criticism Comes Quickly</p>
        <p>But the report of the council, which mainly praised the nation's anti-pollution efforts, was quickly criticized by environmental groups. They complained that it inadequately conveyed the urgency of the environmental problems facing the nation and the world.</p>
        <p>''They have virtually ignored the most pressing environmental problems of the day: global warming and the depletion of the ozone layer,'' said Ruth Caplan, executive director of Environmental Action, a group formed 20 years ago to promote the first Earth Day.</p>
        <p>''It seems to me,'' she said, ''that this is just another example of the council's failure to serve as the environmental conscience of the Administration. America needs to be challenged, not patted on the back.''</p>
        <p>The council was created in 1970 by the National Environmental Policy Act to oversee the executive branch's environmental activities. In that same year, Congress passed the Clean Air Act and President Richard M. Nixon issued an executive order creating the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Reagan the staff of the Council on Environmental Quality was reduced. But the council is being revived and expanded by President Bush and Mr. Deland.</p>
        <p>''There can be little doubt that 1970 was the single most important year in this country's history,'' the council noted in its 494-page annual report.</p>
        <p>Much of the report is devoted to describing the successes achieved by the nation in reducing pollution and protecting public health. While the report points to some ''mixed results'' in areas like protecting wetlands and coastal areas, it emphasizes improvements in the quality of the nation's air, water and soil during a period of substantial economic growth.</p>
        <p>Noting that the population of the United States rose 22 percent over the 20-year period and that the economy grew by 75 percent, the report noted that the country had made substantial progress in reducing the pollutants singled out by the Clean Air Act.</p>
        <p>Paul Allen, a spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, said the report ''has a bland quality about it that gives little indication of the seriousness of the problems we face.''</p>
        <p>In response to a question, Mr. Deland said the report was not intended to be self-congratulatory. He said ''we have without question a long way to go'' in reducing waste, conserving energy and curbing pollution.</p>
