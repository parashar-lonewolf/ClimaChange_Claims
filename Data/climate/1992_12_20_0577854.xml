        <p>CHLORINE ranks number 17 on the periodic table of chemical elements, but it has recently become the No. 1 target of some environmentalists. That's because a long list of organic compounds, from PCB's to dioxins, contain chlorine and they all pose health and environmental risks.</p>
        <p>Chlorine has something of a checkered career, including use in World War I as a choking gas and as part of the more lethal mustard and phosgene gases. Yet it is widely used to purify the water supply in many American cities.</p>
        <p>Greenpeace is calling for the phasing out of chlorine's use. When pressed, officials of the environmental group concede the impracticality of trying to eliminate one of nature's basic elements. It is, after all, a component even of table salt.</p>
        <p>But the group says that many of the chlorinated organic chemicals should be sharply restricted because so many have turned out to be both toxic and environmentally persistent. Its public relations approach has been bold. One leaflet begins with the headline: "What Do Famine, Sterility and Disease Have in Common? Chlorine."</p>
        <p>Greenpeace's call to curtail the use of chlorine is gaining support across the broad political spectrum that characterizes the environmental movement.</p>
        <p>"We have to ask ourselves if we really need these chemicals any more," said Ellen Silbergeld, a senior scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund. "We know they will be persistent if they get into the environment. They are soluble, so they will build up in the fat of fish, birds and people."</p>
        <p>Environmental groups say that banning use is often not enough. For instance, despite the domestic restriction, some American companies continue to manufacture chlorinated pesticides for export overseas. The pesticide residue actually returns to Americans in imported fruit and produce -- what environmentalists call "the circle of poison."</p>
        <p>On the other side of the debate is the chemical industry, which argues that chlorine is vital to commercial chemistry and that a whole category shouldn't be banned simply just because some compounds are toxic. Industry executives point out that municipal water supplies -- not to mention swimming pools -- are disinfected by chlorination. Environmentalists, however, contend that replacement technologies, like treating water with ozone, are available.</p>
        <p>"There are six chlorinated organics that have been found to be persistent and toxic and they have been phased out of use," said Joseph L. Walker, a spokesman for the Chlorine Institute, an industry trade group. "But that does not mean that all the others act the same way. The science does not support that."</p>
        <p>The discovery of the buildup of DDT in the flesh of eagles and other birds, causing severe reproductive damage, led to the ban of that once widely used pesticide nearly two decades ago. Similarly, because of the presence of PCB's in the Great Lakes, many states in that region recommend that people limit their consumption of fish from those waters, particularly larger predators.</p>
        <p>The Federal Environmental Protection Agency is also reassessing the health hazard posed by dioxins, a group of toxic chemicals formed when materials containing chlorine are burned or processed at high temperature. By the end of the century, chlorofluorocarbons, a chlorine compound harmful to the Earth's protective ozone layer, are expected to be banned worldwide.</p>
        <p>Scientists at the International Joint Commission, a United States-Canadian agency that is the environmental watchdog for the Great Lakes, said changes in the area's wildlife prompted that agency last April to call for the phasing out of the industrial use of chlorine compounds. They said such chemicals have been identified as the culprits in a variety of ailments affecting wildlife, including reproductive problems, arrested development, unusual tumors and sex changes.</p>
        <p>"About half the chemicals identified in the lakes are chlorinated organic substances," said Martin Bratzel, a scientist in the commission's office in Windsor, Ontario. "We know some of them are bad, and some of the others probably will be. Why not stop the input to prevent things from getting worse?"</p>
        <p>The commission suggested that timetables be developed in consultation with industry to stop the use of the chemicals. The Chlorine Institute has challenged the commission's recommendations.</p>
        <p>One area where the use of chlorine appears to be in retreat is in pulp and paper. Chlorine and its compounds have been traditionally used to bleach wood pulp for bright white paper. But the water that the plants discharge is often polluted and foul smelling.</p>
        <p>As a result, some paper companies are phasing out such bleaches in favor of alternatives, and chemical industry executives say they expect the trend to continue. When the Union Camp Corporation announced in October it would begin operating a non-chlorine pulp bleaching plant at its mill in Franklin, Va., it described the development as a "major environmental advance."</p>
