      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The state's highest court today upheld a July ruling that the Pataki administration had acted illegally in racing to install so-called minipower plants around New York City without conducting environmental reviews.</p>
        <p>The ruling means the plants must undergo time-consuming reviews or risk being shut down. More important, it sided with environmentalists who demanded the plants meet a much stronger standard for particulate pollution than one enforced by the state.</p>
        <p>The judges upheld an Appellate Division ruling that ordered the New York Power Authority to study, by Jan. 31, the environmental and health effects of the plants, or risk having them shut down. In a one-sentence notice issued today, the Court of Appeals denied the power authority's motion to appeal the earlier decision.</p>
        <p>The decision could have far-reaching consequences. Currently, the state's Environmental Quality Review Act requires that environmental impact studies look at the potential health risks of pollution from any project, and requires that serious problems be addressed by reducing the pollution.</p>
        <p>The state has long included soot particles as small as 10 microns in diameter -- about one-tenth the width of a human hair -- in the list of pollutants that must be studied and controlled.</p>
        <p>But a growing body of research shows that particles as small as 2.5 microns across pose a great danger of respiratory diseases like asthma.</p>
        <p>And the Appellate Division ruled that, in light of such studies, the state must control bits of soot as small as 2.5 microns, which environmentalists hailed as a huge improvement in the control of particulate pollution. They said that until now, no state had imposed controls on such fine particles.</p>
        <p>The ruling ''is a huge precedent,'' said Lisa Garcia, an environmental lawyer who was one of those who argued the case for the New York Public Interest Research Group.</p>
        <p>''This means the state now has to look at and control PM 2.5 for every power plant, every factory, every building, every project with traffic impacts,'' Ms. Garcia said.</p>
        <p>The trade group for power plant owners, Independent Power Producers of New York, contends that while the rulings apply to most industrial projects, the many large power plants that have been proposed across the region might be exempt. (The power authority's mini-plants were a different matter because of their size.) Environmentalists and lawmakers who helped write the relevant state laws dismiss that argument, however, as a desperation ploy by companies that did not want to put tougher pollution controls on their power plants.</p>
        <p>Glenn D. Haake, general counsel for the power producers' group, said meeting the tougher standard could be prohibitively expensive. ''If this court case is deemed to apply to all facilities, that could definitely delay and impede the ability of these projects to be developed,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The federal Environmental Protection Agency has said it plans to set nationwide standards for soot as small as 2.5 microns. But that step is probably still years away.</p>
        <p>Because the Court of Appeals was upholding a lower-court decision, the case did not carry the force of law across the entire state. It applied, instead, only in the region covered by the Appellate Division, Second Department. But that region -- Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, Long Island and much of the Hudson Valley -- includes half the state's population and most of its proposed power plants.</p>
        <p>Lawyers on both sides say that the July ruling will be a guide to courts around the state, however. Having been allowed today by the Court of Appeals to stand, they said, it would likely become the law statewide over time. A case testing the same issues on particulate matter is pending before the Appellate Division that has jurisdiction over Manhattan and the Bronx.</p>
        <p>''As a practical matter, 2.5 now becomes the state standard, including for power plants,'' said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, Democrat of Westchester and chairman of the Environmental Conservation Committee, which supported the lawsuit. ''It's unfortunate that we had to get there through the courts, rather than by the administration taking the lead.''</p>
        <p>The case grew out of the Pataki administration's fears of a power shortage in the metropolitan area, where demand had risen sharply in recent years but supply had not, and where major new plants are not expected to be completed until 2003.</p>
        <p>Late last year, the power authority set out to boost the region's power supply by about 400 megawatts, about the output of a medium-sized power plant, by buying 11 natural gas-fired turbines and installing them at seven sites, six in the city and one on Long Island. The authority pursued the $500 million expansion with little public notice or input, determined to have the turbines running by summer. It insisted that it did not have to draft environmental impact statements, which can take months.</p>
        <p>The mini-plants are among the cleanest power-generating technologies available, but like anything that burns fossil fuels, they produce pollution. As opponents were quick to note, they were all installed in low-income, mostly minority neighborhoods that already had air pollution problems caused by heavy concentrations of industrial plants.</p>
        <p>The power authority pledged to put pollution controls on nearby sources like bus depots and factories, so that there would be no net increase in emissions. Michael Petralia, a spokesman for the agency, said it was still deciding which such projects to pursue.</p>
        <p>As it turned out, the turbines helped get the region through a summer that shattered records for demand and strained the power grid almost to the breaking point.</p>
        <p>''These generators played a critical role in keeping the lights on in New York City and Long Island,'' Mr. Petralia said. ''We will comply with the court order, and we have already begun to prepare an environmental impact statement. We believe that when the environmental analysis is done, it will find that we operated without adverse environmental impacts.''</p>
