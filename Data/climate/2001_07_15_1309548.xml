        <p>WHEN the six blind men of Indostan approached the elephant of the Hindu fable, their perceptions were colored by where they stood. Certainly, if you grasped the tail of the beast, you might think you held a rope; the ear could indeed be mistaken for a fan; and the trunk was very like a snake. But each man missed the big picture. In its totality, the elephant, with its versatility and cargo capacity, its voracious appetite and its high center of gravity -- not to mention its natural-hide upholstery -- quite resembled a sport utility vehicle.</p>
        <p>What, then, is one to make of the 2002 Cadillac Escalade, which may be like the elephant in its bulk and its thirst, but is far more comfortable, quite a lot faster and much more pleasing to the nose? That depends mostly on where you stand -- not in physical relation to it, but on a spectrum of social, political and economic issues.</p>
        <p>Laissez-faire capitalists may see this behemoth as an example of free markets at work. Clearly, there is demand for luxurious mega-utilities, and General Motors is just one of several companies offering a supply.</p>
        <p>Social critics might point out that public policy is skewed in favor of large trucks, of which the Escalade is one, even if it is mostly used as a car. As a truck, the Escalade is subject to less stringent rules on safety, emissions and fuel economy.</p>
        <p>Libertarians might answer that government has no business regulating private enterprise, while environmentalists would say that the Escalade, which gulps a gallon of unleaded premium every 12 to 15 miles, is a crime against nature.</p>
        <p>Safety researchers might point out that the nearly three-ton Escalade can potentially ride over cars' bumpers and frames. Others could say that the Cadillac makes sense from a passenger's perspective, since those inside S.U.V.'s tend to fare well in crashes.</p>
        <p>There are those who are drawn to the Escalade simply because it is so far over the top. You see them pulling up to McMansions in the suburbs and to hip-hop clubs downtown, making a statement before the truck comes to a halt. On the flip side, it is not hard to find people who are appalled, sometimes with fanatical fervor, by what the Escalade represents. Glaring from subcompacts or crosswalks, they seem to hold this hulk of metal responsible for global warming and dolphins in tuna nets.</p>
        <p>How, then, can a car enthusiast judge the redesigned Escalade, which at $47,990 to $52,535 is now the most expensive production vehicle from G.M. (not counting the even more ostentatious Hummer)?</p>
        <p>Frankly, if you give the big thing half a chance, you may be seduced. Even if you do not care for big sport utilities -- and I don't, usually -- you may have to concede that they don't get much better than this.</p>
        <p>Start with the underlying architecture, based on the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups and shared with a bevy of large S.U.V.'s. This is an exceptionally strong and refined platform, a jewel from a company that uses discounts and rebates to bribe customers into its cars, yet enjoys robust demand for its big, capable trucks.</p>
        <p>The previous Escalade, which made a hasty debut in 1998 as a '99 model, was closeout merchandise, rushed to market to counter the unexpectedly successful Lincoln Navigator. The new Escalade is based on the new Chevy Tahoe, itself a standout among full-size S.U.V.'s, and it now has some features to justify its $10,000 to $20,000 premium over the Chevy (and $4,000 over the GMC Yukon Denali, its closest kin).</p>
        <p>All-wheel-drive Escalades, for instance, have a 6-liter V-8 that makes 345 horsepower and 380 foot-pounds of torque, the most power of any S.U.V. (The Denali has 320 horses and the Tahoe LT, like the rear-drive Escalade, has 285; the Navigator has 300.)</p>
        <p>While the Escalade comes in a rear-drive version, many buyers in the snowy Northeast -- and in the sandy Middle East, where G.M. sees a market among oil-rich sheiks -- will opt for the full-time all-wheel drive. It ordinarily sends 62 percent of the power to the rear wheels, but continuously adjusts the flow depending on conditions.</p>
        <p>The Escalade also has Cadillac's stability control, which uses electronic sensors, the antilock brakes and the traction control to keep the truck going in the intended direction. Such systems are just starting to show up in top-heavy S.U.V.'s, where they are most needed to help prevent rollovers.</p>
        <p>Alone among G.M.'s big utilities, the Escalade has an electronic road-sensing suspension. Cadillac also provides a rear parking sensor to let you know if you are about to back into the broad side of your barn, and premium services from the OnStar help line, including Personal Calling, which makes hands-free phone calls. There is also a six-disc in-dash CD changer, which plays through an 11-speaker Bose audio system.</p>
        <p>All Escalades have a third-row seat that accommodates, in theory, three passengers and brings total capacity to eight people. The double center-opening ''barn doors'' of the previous model are gone, replaced by a huge swing-up liftgate that is, fortunately, made of lightweight aluminum. The third seat is split, and each half, which weighs just 37 pounds, can be removed separately.</p>
        <p>The interior leather is called Nuance, and it is as soft and fragrant as anything this side of England. There is rich wood on the doors and part of the steering wheel, though a plastic facsimile is pasted to the dash and console. The instrument panel is similar to those in a million G.M. trucks, though the gauges have classy bright trim and sporty lettering. In all, the cabin is a mishmash of truck parts and Cadillac glitz, but the pieces are pulled together nicely -- if you overlook the yawning gaps between panels.</p>
        <p>G.M.'s interior quality seems to be getting better. The test Escalade's console didn't wobble like jelly -- for a long time, jiggling the console was a good way to determine whether you were sitting in a G.M. vehicle.</p>
        <p>But why can't this giant company come up with window switches that respond the first time, every time, when you touch a button? Or that both lower and raise the windows -- all of them -- with one touch? This is a small thing, but it is the kind of detail that German and Japanese luxury models delivered long ago, and is now common in Volkswagens and Nissans.</p>
        <p>The new Escalade gets enhanced air-conditioning and an automatic climate control, though one with only two zones (front seat and rear). The much cheaper Olds Bravada has a three-zone system with climate settings for the driver, passenger and back seat. Further, while the Escalade heats both the front and second rows, the Bravada's front seats have separate controls for the bottom and rear cushions, and more settings.</p>
        <p>Amenities aside, the Escalade's appeal is likely to lie largely in its presence. To see this Cadillac's front end filling your rear-view mirror is to know the meaning of intimidation. The huge grille, shaped like the cowcatcher on an old locomotive, has three beefy horizontal bars capped with a chrome strip (though the grille, fashioned of wimpy plastic, has more bark than bite). The stacked headlamps form exclamation points on each side, punctuated by foglights in the bumper. Coupled with puddle lights under the power-folding outside mirrors, there is a lot of illumination activity going on.</p>
        <p>The sharp lines of the Escalade's face and rump are harbingers of the crisply techno look that all Cadillacs will eventually wear. Alas, the angular front end doesn't mesh with the softly flowing body sides inherited from the Tahoe.</p>
        <p>But no one will mistake the Escalade for a Chevy, given that it shouts its geneology with emblems the size of dinner plates on the grille and liftgate. These are Cadillac's new, updated wreath-and-crest insignias -- the famous ducks no longer roost there -- and this is their first appearance on a production vehicle.</p>
        <p>There is some justification for this self-conscious pride, for the Escalade is quite competent, with excellent driving dynamics for a big S.U.V. So long as the pavement is good, the Cadillac is smooth and stable, and the electronic damping keeps body movements under control. Further, the Escalade handles corners far better than the Navigator, its floaty, mattress-soft rival.</p>
        <p>The steering is quite light, but direct and responsive, without the nervousness of the Navigator and some other big S.U.V.'s.</p>
        <p>The power is not just impressive -- Car and Driver magazine recorded a zero to 60 m.p.h. time of 7.8 seconds -- it is delivered with finesse. The throttle response is nicely modulated, so that the Escalade surges with authority but without jerking.</p>
        <p>And the Escalade is commendably quiet for what is, in effect, a big box pummeling the air.</p>
        <p>The Cadillac's full-time all-wheel drive requires no thought from the driver, but it can't keep up with the heavy-duty four-wheel-drive systems of a Range Rover or a Lexus LX 470. Susan Docherty, the Escalade brand manager, isn't worried. An ''infinitesimal number'' of Escalade owners will ever go off road, she says, and few will ever tow anything. Tongue firmly in cheek, she calls her truck ''a mall-terrain vehicle.''</p>
        <p>If the Escalade is more at home on Rodeo Drive than on the Rubicon Trail, it is only fitting. Like great Cadillacs of the distant past, it is huge, powerful, opulent and excessive, a truck that athletes, movie stars and musicians might desire.</p>
        <p>Whitney Houston is said to have walked into a New Jersey dealer to get one. Other famous customers, Cadillac says, include the singers Natalie Cole and Tyrese; the actors Bruce Willis and Calista Flockhart; the basketball stars Ray Allen, Shaquille O'Neal and Gary Payton; and N.B.A. draft picks like Eddy Curry and Jason Richardson.</p>
        <p>The big truck has sold briskly even in a year of spiking gasoline prices, and is on track to meet projections of 25,000 sales this year. More important, it is revitalizing Cadillac's geriatric demographics. The average buyer is 51, compared with 62 for Cadillacs in general, and buyers have an average household income of $160,000. Forty percent of Escalade customers are women, and nearly 20 percent are black.</p>
        <p>''Finally there's a buzz for Cadillac,'' said Ms. Docherty, the brand manager. ''It's been a long time.''</p>
