        <p>What's big, yellow and has a radical agenda? Now it can be told: It's Big Bird. Grown fat and happy off your tax dollars, he's the one to blame for a wide variety of urban ills.</p>
        <p>Laurence Jarvik, a scholar at the conservative Heritage Foundation, was the first to see the vulture in that mass of feathers. In an interview in this newspaper last month, he charged that " 'Sesame Street' is just another kid's show, no better than 'Underdog' or 'The Flintstones.' " No better certainly, and potentially a serious threat, as Mr. Jarvik goes on to prove. "What did the taxpayers get for their investment in 'Sesame Street?' A generation of kids who spray graffiti on the walls of New York City. If 'Sesame Street' was so effective, why do we have such a literacy problem?"</p>

        <p>What's big, yellow and has a radical agenda? Now it can be told: It's Big Bird. Grown fat and happy off your tax dollars, he's the one to blame for a wide variety of urban ills.</p>
        <p>Laurence Jarvik, a scholar at the conservative Heritage Foundation, was the first to see the vulture in that mass of feathers. In an interview in this newspaper last month, he charged that " 'Sesame Street' is just another kid's show, no better than 'Underdog' or 'The Flintstones.' " No better certainly, and potentially a serious threat, as Mr. Jarvik goes on to prove. "What did the taxpayers get for their investment in 'Sesame Street?' A generation of kids who spray graffiti on the walls of New York City. If 'Sesame Street' was so effective, why do we have such a literacy problem?"</p>
        <p>Why, indeed? Suddenly the scales drop from our eyes. If it weren't for the insidious doings of the Children's Television Workshop, we'd be way ahead of the Japanese. Until the Heritage Foundation came along, most of us failed to see the links between Bert, Ernie and declining S.A.T. scores.</p>
        <p>Sadly, it doesn't stop there. New evidence also shows that the public television gang is behind global warming, short skirts, the House banking scam and Pat Buchanan's candidacy. One thing is certain: The muppets didn't act alone. Somebody gave them a hand.</p>
        <p>There's already an all-points bulletin out on a goofy looking guy whose tastes run to baggy cardigans. A real cool customer, he speaks in measured tones, does everything nice and slow and ties his shoelaces pretty as you please. Goes by the name of Rogers. Street name: "Mister." From the looks of him, butter wouldn't melt in his mouth. But he's wanted for taking generations of innocent youths on a magic trolley ride to a neighborhood of make believe riddled with fairies, elves and welfare queens.</p>
        <p>For adults only, they have another con man, a real smoothie who speaks a mean BBC and has a way with a plot summary. Off camera, though, Alistair is strictly veneer, Naugahyde and a well-thumbed collection of Cliffs Notes. Every Sunday, "Cookie" works the same crowd, the easy marks with the big bucks, the good teeth and the Volvos. Before they know what's hit them, they've missed the latest Valerie Bertinelli flick and are hooked on a grueling, 12-part Evelyn Waugh masterpiece.</p>
        <p>Who laid the foundation for all this? Most whisper it's the master carpenter himself. Norm appears out of nowhere, restoring this old house, then that old house, undermining the family structure as he goes. Children adore him. As a result, their Sheetrock-impaired dads slink away, take to hard liquor and eventually apply for public assistance. There's also Norm's effect on the economy. And what of the eggheads who clog our emergency rooms, all because Norm convinced them that being historically correct means handling easy-to-use power tools?</p>
        <p>But before we join Mr. Jarvik in his cry for "Underdog," maybe we should take a closer look at his heroes. True, "Underdog" never took a dime of Federal funds, but something about his name sounds vaguely Democratic. In a certain light, he looks a lot like Paul Tsongas, and then there's the matter of his relationship with Polly "Sweet Polly" Purebread, and those secret energy pills he kept popping.</p>
        <p>With Fred and Barney, though, you've got basic American values. Both were conservative Republicans, Goldwater men. They drank beer, bowled and worked at the quarry, while Wilma and Betty stayed home and made the Brontoburgers. You know what? This country could use a few more characters just like them. But until Congress reins in PBS -- they're expected to consider doing so this week -- we'll continue to watch in horror as our children count aloud from one to 10 and spray-paint tags like "Grover" and "Kermit" all over town.</p>
