        <p>Making fun of the president is not ideological. Not making fun of the president, on the other hand, is.</p>
        <p>And that's what distinguishes ''The  1/2 Hour News Hour,'' a Fox News version of ''The Daily Show With Jon Stewart,'' from most other satirical shows. Comedians like Mr. Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Jay Leno and David Letterman ridicule whoever is in power, be it Bill Clinton or President Bush, John McCain or Nancy Pelosi.</p>

        <p>Making fun of the president is not ideological. Not making fun of the president, on the other hand, is.</p>
        <p>And that's what distinguishes ''The  1/2 Hour News Hour,'' a Fox News version of ''The Daily Show With Jon Stewart,'' from most other satirical shows. Comedians like Mr. Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Jay Leno and David Letterman ridicule whoever is in power, be it Bill Clinton or President Bush, John McCain or Nancy Pelosi.</p>
        <p>The Fox News comedy only leans on the left.</p>
        <p>On a mock news program much like ''Weekend Update'' on ''Saturday Night Live,'' the targets are Hillary Rodham Clinton, Barack Obama, global warming, Hollywood liberals, politically correct children's books (''Harry Potter and the Alternative Lifestyle'') and the American Civil Liberties Union. A few riffs by the fake anchors, Kurt McNally (Kurt Long) and Jennifer Lange (Jennifer Robertson), are funny, yet others fall flat. But strangely, given the current wealth of material, there are no jokes about Mr. Bush, Dick Cheney or I. Lewis Libby Jr.</p>
        <p>Sometimes the humor is so heavy-handed that it seems almost like self-parody. The premiere tomorrow opens with Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter in a skit set in January 2009. Mr. Limbaugh is the newly elected commander in chief, and he tells his fellow Americans that his Democratic opponent, Howard Dean, is ''finally getting the medical attention he has so desperately needed for so long,'' which is a strange joke for Mr. Limbaugh to make, given his history of pain killers and prescription fraud.</p>
        <p>Any notion that Mr. Limbaugh is trying to be slyly self-deprecating is quickly deflated by the earnest indignation fueling this comedy show.</p>
        <p>Almost 30 years after the Reagan revolution, conservatives have to tilt pretty far to portray themselves as marginalized and downtrodden. Republicans controlled the House and the Senate until only recently, and they still run the White House, but the impulse to paint themselves as a persecuted minority leading a cultural war against the Hollywood-led liberal media dies hard.</p>
        <p>It's a strange new comic order when the actor and environmentalist Ed Begley Jr. and his hybrid cars loom larger than the Iraq war, the deficit or White House leaks.</p>
        <p>It's not surprising that a Fox News comedy show would share the same bunker sensibility as the rest of the network. That 24-hour cable news channel was created as a conservative antidote to mainstream news organizations. The us-against-them empire keeps growing. Rupert Murdoch announced that his latest venture, the Fox Business Channel, would be ''more business-friendly than CNBC.'' (If nothing else, that is perhaps a sign that Mr. Murdoch does have a sense of humor.)</p>
        <p>''The  1/2 Hour News Hour'' is not even the first comedy show on Fox News. ''Red Eye,'' a loose and slightly naughty late-night talk show, has a conservative but flippant bent. The host, Greg Gutfeld, says his show is ''like Anderson Cooper without the poppers.'' But the panelists are young and try to be hip, so they mostly talk off the cuff about sex, stupid news items and celebrities.</p>
        <p>'' 1/2 Hour'' is more tightly wound. Some of the writing is clever. ''After months of being criticized for hosting a Holocaust denial conference in December,'' Mr. McNally says, ''the Iranian government is now denying that the conference ever took place.'' He adds, ''Or if it did, that attendance figures were greatly exaggerated by a Zionist-controlled media.''</p>
        <p>But most of the punch lines are silly, and the material too skimpy and narrow in range. It has been a long time since anyone laughed at jokes about Representative Dennis J. Kucinich, Democrat of Ohio.</p>
        <p>There is nothing wrong with Fox News adding a comedy show to its roster, and in some ways it's quite fitting. Humor is by definition unfair and unbalanced, but it is most effective when it is more evenly and broadly spread.</p>
        <p>The  1/2 Hour News Hour</p>
        <p>Fox News, tomorrow night at 10, Eastern and Pacific times; 9, Central time.</p>
        <p>Joel Surnow and Manny Coto, executive producers; Ned Rice and Sandy Frank, writers; Michael Dimich, director; K C Warnke, producer; Joe Revello and Michael Binkow, co-executive producers; developed for television by Mr. Surnow, Mr. Coto and Mr. Rice. A Milaca Productions presentation.</p>
        <p>WITH: Kurt Long (Kurt McNally) and Jennifer Robertson (Jennifer Lange).</p>
