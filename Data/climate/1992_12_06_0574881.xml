        <p>A wiry, chain-smoking, Sanskrit-quoting genius by the name of J.

        <p>A wiry, chain-smoking, Sanskrit-quoting genius by the name of J. Robert Oppenheimer traipsed through the snow atop a densely forested mesa in northern New Mexico to found the Los Alamos lab, the birthplace of the atomic bomb and spiritual home of what grew into a maze of 20 or so nuclear sites around the country. That complex, which today, some 50 years later, has some 100,000 employees and an annual budget of $11 billion, is scrambling to reinvent itself amid celebrations marking the birth of the nuclear era. The soul-searching, which began at the cold war's end, is accelerating because of Bill Clinton, who has pledged his presidency to domestic renewal. The question of the moment is how far, and how fast, the nuclear complex can move beyond the bomb.</p>
        <p>"It's the most radical change we've ever faced," Dr. Siegfried S. Hecker, director of Los Alamos, said Thursday. "There still are defense jobs we need to do, but we have to be more responsive to helping solve the nation's economic problems."</p>
        <p>The 9,000-person lab, with an annual budget of more than $1 billion, has no nuclear arms under development for the first time in its history, officials say. The situation is similar to Ford or General Motors producing no cars, and pondering whether to get into a new business.</p>
        <p>Today the push throughout the nuclear complex is to aid industry, chiefly by sharing exotic skills and technologies. Los Alamos, for instance, claims global preeminence in supercomputing. But the red tape around such jewels is often thick and intimidating.</p>
        <p>About 3 percent of the Los Alamos budget goes to joint ventures with private industry. Bill Clinton has called for up to 20 percent to go into such partnerships, saying the Federal labs are slumbering giants of industrial might.</p>
        <p>"We have these incredible resources," Mr. Clinton said of the labs during the campaign, adding that "we have but only scratched the surface of their potential."</p>
        <p>Perhaps. The atomic breakthroughs of World War II fed the popular notion that scientific wizards and Federal funds could team up to achieve almost anything. The Apollo moon program did nothing to diminish that idea, although the marriage of money and brains produced countless flops like synthetic fuels, breeder reactors and Star Wars. Painful Rebirth</p>
        <p>A spiritual rebirth for the bomb makers, the founders of the Federal-science paradigm, may be quite painful not only because of the inherent difficulty of making bold advances outside their field, but also because they succeeded at their military job for so long. Their institutional habits, and obsessions with secrecy, are now a half century old.</p>
        <p>The hunt for what would become Los Alamos predated the celebrated test of the world's first reactor in Chicago on Dec. 2, 1942, which showed that sustained nuclear fission was possible and likely to lead to a bomb. Impatient for success, Oppenheimer, a 38-year-old physicist chosen to direct the bomb designers, led Army officials visiting New Mexico on Nov. 16 to a high mesa with stunning views of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. A light snow was falling. He wanted the site for its beauty, sure it would inspire his team. The military liked its isolation. By the time scientists starting arriving in March 1943, Army crews were erecting a small city of barracks and Quonset huts and lab buildings, all ringed by barbed wire.</p>
        <p>Other sites followed -- Argonne outside Chicago to advance reactor studies, Hanford in Washington State to produce plutonium for bombs, Oak Ridge in Tennessee to enrich uranium and fashion it into arms. After the atomic bombing of Japan and the start of the cold war, the network grew: Sandia in Albuquerque to make firing and safety circuits, Livermore in California to design more bombs, Pantex in Texas to perfect mass assembly.</p>
        <p>Herbert S. Marks, general counsel of the Atomic Energy Commission, once remarked that the bomb enterprise bore no relation to the industrial or social life of the nation. "It was a separate state, with its own airplanes and its own factories and its thousands of secrets," he said. "It had a peculiar sovereignty, one that could bring about the end, peacefully or violently, or all other sovereignties."</p>
        <p>Today the complex itself is torn by change. Warhead production has been thrown into reverse, with disassembly and storage now in the fore. Some facilities are being mothballed. The biggest challenges, and hopes, center on the science labs of Sandia, Livermore and Los Alamos, which are seen as treasure troves of intellectual riches.</p>
        <p>"We are living in a world where brain power will determine the lives of all our people," Mr. Clinton told Sandia workers during the campaign. "I want to make sure that each of you has a chance to contribute your full potential."</p>
        <p>Los Alamos is already shifting gears, Dr. Hecker says. In two years it has signed 31 cooperative agreements with industry, and has 40 pending. It has teamed with Motorola to cut the use of chlorofluorocarbons, which work wonders in cleaning electronic circuit boards but are also destroying the Earth's ozone layer. In another joint venture, Los Alamos is working with Life Technologies to develop an innovative technology aimed at speeding the quest to map the human gene.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hecker said Los Alamos is also pioneering technologies on its own that the Government might ordain for wide civilian use, such as high-speed supercomputer networks similar to the national "information superhighways" advocated by Vice-President-elect Albert Gore. Hiding Old Loves?</p>
        <p>The lab is also devoting much energy to what Dr. Hecker called the "nuclear draw-down," dismantling arms, cleaning up the weapons complex and developing ways to limit the bomb's spread around the world. "The country needs the smarts to deal with whatever nuclear weapons are left and their legacy," he said. "That's the core of what we do. But I'm optimistic we can also aid the domestic agenda."</p>
        <p>Critics say the new industrial drive could simply provide a cloak for old loves. "The labs are not only looking for new ideas in nuclear weapons," said William M. Arkin, military research director for Greenpeace, "but are doing so in a manner that is increasingly secretive."</p>
        <p>John Stroud, an official with Concerned Citizens for Nuclear Safety, based in Santa Fe, said Los Alamos was expanding its bomb work as other centers were retired. "They pay lip service to industrial partnerships," he said, "but are unwilling to take any risks that would commit the lab to an alternative course."</p>
        <p>Dr. Hecker said some nuclear work at Los Alamos was indeed growing but would only "help to slow the decline." And with scientific caution, he added that the industrial push, while promising, offered no guarantee of a surge in national innovation.</p>
        <p>"I'm optimistic because the private sector is taking a significant interest in us," he said. "But now we have to demonstrate that we can actually do some good."</p>
