        <p>He is a popular incumbent and a shrewd strategist, a prodigious fund-raiser and a moderate whose appeal crosses regional and ideological bounds.</p>
        <p>But as Gov. George E. Pataki looks toward a probable bid for a third term next year, the path to re-election is pocked with hazards. A Republican, he reigns over a state that leans heavily Democratic and that gave Al Gore a 25 percent margin last year, and he is likely to face a well-known, well-financed opponent. The rollicking economy has stalled, and critics are warning that an electric power shortage may be just over the horizon.</p>
        <p>This shapes up as a very tough race for Mr. Pataki, his advisers and other political strategists agree. Public opinion polls have said as much, showing that while the governor enjoys high approval ratings, he leads either of his potential Democratic challengers, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall and Andrew M. Cuomo, the former United States housing secretary, by about 10 points -- not the kind of commanding lead incumbents usually enjoy a year and a half before the election, nor the 30-point lead he had the last time around.</p>
        <p>A hard-fought primary could hurt the eventual Democratic nominee, but the early start of the campaigns by two heavyweight Democratic contenders means that New Yorkers are in for 18 months of noisy Pataki-bashing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki is already ardently courting minority voters and organized labor, hoping to make inroads into those historically Democratic blocs. He has strengthened his identification with causes like gun control, abortion rights and environmental protection that are very popular in New York.</p>
        <p>''In this state, you begin as a Republican by being a million votes down,'' said Representative John E. Sweeney, a former deputy chief of staff to Mr. Pataki who remains one of his closest allies. ''This one is not going to be easy. But the governor has an advantage that he's a known commodity with a strong record of accomplishment. And don't forget, he's good at this.''</p>
        <p>The governor has made a career out of being underestimated. Behind his smiling, regular-guy demeanor is a fierce, smart competitor who has never lost an election and has won every office he ever held by toppling an incumbent. He raised a formidable $20 million for his 1998 re-election campaign, $6 million more than the amount spent during his 1994 campaign. He is almost certain not only to surpass that figure this time, but to raise substantially more than any challenger.</p>
        <p>He declined to be interviewed for this article, but his advisers say he sees the challenge ahead as clearly as anyone. He has been appearing around the state, announcing grants and attending groundbreakings, at nearly a campaign-style pace, and raising money at events from Puerto Rico to California.</p>
        <p>The biggest question is which Democrat he will face. Nearly all analysts say it is too early to tell who would make the tougher opponent, but it is something the governor's strategists are already thinking about, considering ways they might tilt the Democratic field in favor of one candidate or the other.</p>
        <p>''People who make guesses at this point about who he'd rather face are doing just that, guessing,'' one Pataki adviser said. ''I change my mind at least once a week.''</p>
        <p>The Pataki camp -- like nearly everyone else in state politics -- sees Mr. Cuomo as a more driven, sharp-elbowed competitor than Mr. McCall, but they say that by the same token, he risks seeming humorless, even mean. Because of his father, former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Mr. Cuomo has enviable name recognition that could help him with Democratic voters, but Mr. Pataki's team is confident that it would be a drawback with independents and Republicans. Mr. McCall is widely liked, but some Republicans and Democrats question whether he has the intensity for a full-scale campaign.</p>
        <p>Some Republican strategists would rather see Mr. Cuomo win the primary, calculating that in defeating Mr. McCall, who is black, Mr. Cuomo would alienate black voters, a core Democratic group. Others discount the advantage in that.</p>
        <p>''Whoever wins the Democratic primary, the best thing for the governor would be for that primary to remain contested and close right up to the end, so that the other guy is likely to emerge bruised, and maybe even short on money,'' said a Pataki adviser.</p>
        <p>Whoever his opponent is, the governor will be in a race unlike any he has faced before. In 1994, he was a little-known state senator, running against Mr. Cuomo the elder, in an election that was a referendum on an increasingly unpopular incumbent. In 1998, the strongest potential challengers declined to take on Mr. Pataki, and he faced the weakest Democratic gubernatorial candidate in decades, Peter F. Vallone, the New York City Council speaker. The outcome was never in doubt.</p>
        <p>With a strong Democrat, the race next year is likely to be largely about Mr. Pataki -- his record, his promises, his ethics and his friends.</p>
        <p>On one of those fronts, Mr. McCall and Mr. Cuomo are already busy reminding audiences of the governor's links to President Bush, who is deeply unpopular in New York, a state where he won just 35 percent of the vote. The governor has already distanced himself on several issues, like rules on carbon dioxide emissions at power plants, from the man he campaigned for and called his friend, his aides drawing reporters' attention to the effort each time.</p>
        <p>People close to the governor talk, as Republican strategists have for decades, of winning over minority voters, particularly Hispanics, who, they contend, are essentially conservative.</p>
        <p>''One of the priorities we have is outreach to groups that aren't traditionally aligned with Republicans -- Hispanics and Asians and African-Americans and the gay community,'' said Alexander F. Treadwell, chairman of the Republican State Committee and a friend of Mr. Pataki's. Mr. Pataki took 25 percent of the Hispanic vote in 1998, according to exit polls, and his camp has high hopes of improving on that showing. They are less optimistic about surpassing the 15 percent of the black vote he won in that race -- particularly if Mr. McCall is the Democratic nominee. But they say it is important for the governor to appeal to blacks, if only so that they are not motivated to turn out in large numbers against him.</p>
        <p>Over the past two months, the governor has intensely wooed minority voters, making repeated appearances in heavily black, Hispanic and immigrant neighborhoods in and around New York City, often accompanied by minority political figures.</p>
        <p>In particular, the governor has become a vocal opponent of the Navy's bombing of the Puerto Rican island of Vieques, a subject he rarely mentioned before this year. His actions on the issue, including lobbying the Bush administration, have attracted heavy, mostly positive coverage in New York City's Spanish-language news media.</p>
        <p>At an East Harlem rally last month, Mr. Pataki shouted, ''No ms bombas!'' and announced that he would go to Vieques, which he did the following week. On that trip to Puerto Rico, and again last week in New York City, he held news conferences with Gov. Sila M. Calder n of Puerto Rico, whom he embraced and kissed, and a raft of other Hispanic politicians to denounce the bombing. Just this week, he appeared with Denise Qui. Daniels was the first black person to hold that position in more than 20 years. When the governor swore in Mr. Daniels, the sort of thing that is usually done quietly, the ceremony was staged at the Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building in Harlem.</p>
        <p>The governor has also stepped up his courtship of organized labor, beginning with Dennis Rivera, leader of the hospital workers' union, 1199, and one of the state's most prominent Hispanic political figures. In March, the state A.F.L.-C.I.O. held a fund-raiser for the governor, a first.</p>
        <p>A few issues could prove difficult for Mr. Pataki in the coming months. If the state's energy problems turn into a full-fledged crisis, he is likely to be blamed, rightly or not, as the man who led the charge for deregulation, and Democrats are already working to pin those troubles on him. Recent revelations about State University of New York contracts going to people with ties to the governor could return to haunt him. And how Mr. Pataki, who has benefited from a healthy economy in past elections, might fare if the situation weakens significantly remains unclear.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki's biggest challenge is New York, itself, where Republicans seem as much the underdogs as ever.</p>
        <p>''He's a good fit for the state because he's a moderate, and he's been a good governor, but when in doubt, the state wants to go Democratic, so there's not a lot of margin of error for him,'' said Mike Murphy, the political consultant who handled Representative Rick A. Lazio's failed Senate bid last year.</p>
        <p>The Democrats' advantage over Republicans among registered voters has grown in recent years, and now stands at 5 million to 3.1 million, and Republicans have fared poorly in recent elections. In 1998, Charles E. Schumer unseated Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato and Eliot L. Spitzer knocked off Attorney General Dennis C. Vacco, leaving the governor as the only Republican elected to statewide office. Last year, not only did Mr. Gore swamp Mr. Bush in New York but Hillary Rodham Clinton also won by 12 percent. And Democrats have made gains in recent legislative and local elections.</p>
        <p>Most encouraging to the Democrats, in upstate New York, long a Republican redoubt, Mr. Schumer took 45 percent of the vote, and Mrs. Clinton 47 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki's advisers and allies play down many of those specifics as isolated cases, but even they acknowledge that, in all, New York has become unfriendly turf for Republicans.</p>
        <p>''The ground rules have changed in New York,'' said Representative Peter T. King, a Long Island Republican. ''Upstate isn't guaranteed Republican territory any more, the suburbs are changing. New York is becoming a more Democratic state.''</p>
