        <p>When the heads of most of the world's biggest oil companies were recently invited to the home of the Saudi Ambassador to the United States in McLean, Va., each of the seven tried valiantly to put his best foot forward. They had come, after all, to discuss a tantalizing opportunity -- helping Saudi Arabia develop its vast energy reserves.</p>
        <p>Up first was Lee R. Raymond, Exxon's chairman, who delivered a trim, concise speech. He recited, from memory, statistics on Saudi natural gas reserves and suggested some specific ways Exxon might be able to help.</p>
        <p>Five other executives followed, each making low-key, carefully worded pitches. Finally, it was the turn of Lucio A. Noto, Mobil's chairman, who, characteristically, started off with a joke.</p>
        <p>Little had changed, he said, since Mobil had been the smallest partner in Aramco, the four-company partnership the Saudis nationalized in the 1970's and still maintain to run their oil industry. Now, once again, he was the last in line.</p>
        <p>That shattered the meeting's icy atmosphere, allowing Mr. Noto to go into a lengthy discourse on the Saudi political landscape, ground he was familiar with because he knew some Saudi princes when he was a young Mobil executive in their country two decades before.</p>
        <p>The bosses at Exxon and Mobil, in short, have markedly different styles, making their proposed alliance seem an odd match indeed.</p>
        <p>Not that it would be a marriage of equals, though. It is Mr. Raymond who would put a far bigger stamp on the combined company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Raymond, 60, has always been clear and focused. He grew up in tiny Watertown, S.D., and, in 1963, armed with a doctorate in chemical engineering from the University of Minnesota, he joined Exxon as a production research engineer. In his methodical rise at Exxon, he never flinched from tough assignments, including overseeing the cleanup of the Exxon Valdez oil spill and the legal settlements that followed. He gained a reputation of being reserved and analytical, of investing Exxon's huge cash flow with great care. So it surprised no one when he was named chairman and chief executive in 1993.</p>
        <p>Mr. Noto, also 60, has a far quirkier resume. The son of Italian immigrants, he once pushed clothing-filled carts in New York in the summer. Persistent and gregarious, he was able, soon after he getting his M.B.A. at Cornell and starting his climb at Mobil, to impress the powerful with a savvy sense of political and economic trends. He was a dark horse when the top spot opened up in 1994, and even he was surprised when he was named chairman, president and chief executive.</p>
        <p>And in many ways, each man does reflect the company he leads.</p>
        <p>Mobil, which spends millions to run opinion-laden advertisements and sponsor ''Masterpiece Theater,'' has long been aggressive in courting public opinion. Run by strong executives who are given a lot of leeway to take risks, the company found ways to make deals to move into Russia and Kazakhstan. And it is quick to apply new technology, leading the way, for instance, in credit card systems that allow pay-at-the-pump gasoline sales. Before Mr. Noto came  on the scene, though, Mobil's return on equity was far from stellar.</p>
        <p>Exxon, by contrast, run under the tight grip of Mr. Raymond and a small group of top executives, tries to avoid the limelight even when news is good. It excels at squeezing the most return from the resources it has, but balks at taking political risks. And while its exploration skills are first rate and its refineries and network of service stations are run with clockwork efficiency, it likes to limit its risk. For example, it let Royal Dutch/Shell show that oil and natural gas could be profitably recovered from fields thousands of feet below the ocean surface before taking the big plunge itself.</p>
        <p>And the merged company, with Mr. Raymond in charge, would be likely to mirror the Exxon model, with the devotion to cost-cutting and engineering prowess that has made Exxon by far the most profitable of the oil majors. In an era of $11-a-barrel oil, energy diplomacy and power politics -- Mobil's specialties -- may have to take a back seat for now.</p>
        <p>Not that Mobil, and its distinctive style, would be entirely swallowed up. As in any marriage of opposites, analysts say, the beginning may be rocky.</p>
        <p>''They are both so independent that they like to do things their way,'' said Fred Leuffer, an oil analyst at Bear, Stearns. ''That makes it almost impossible to get together in any amicable way.''</p>
        <p>Yet each may find that his partner has strengths that will shore up each company's weaknesses.</p>
        <p>In an interview yesterday afternoon in Manhattan, Mr. Noto, sitting next to Mr. Raymond, acknowledged that the two had different styles, but said, ''You don't run a company based on style.''</p>
        <p>He added that he was ''quite comfortable'' working for Mr. Raymond, a rival he has butted heads with many a time. ''I can adapt myself to this,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mathieu Zajdela, a managing director of the Petroleum Finance Company, a consulting group based in Washington, who has worked with Mobil in Europe over the years, foresees difficulties, however, because Exxon is so much bigger.</p>
        <p>The danger, analysts say, is that Mr. Raymond, so used to thinking of Exxon as a paragon of efficiency and profitability, could ride roughshod over Mobil. And the merger could, in fact, leave Mr. Noto playing a very limited role as vice chairman of a 19-member board that would include just 6 directors from Mobil.</p>
        <p>Mr. Raymond plans to take all the top positions -- chairman, chief executive and president. And the headquarters of the new Exxon Mobil would be in Irving, Tex., the Dallas suburb that is Exxon's home, far from Mobil's home base in Fairfax, Va., which would house the company's management for refining and marketing.</p>
        <p>Not that Mr. Noto would be surprised at his secondary role. The plunging crude oil prices that have put pressure on the whole industry have hit Mobil especially hard because it is smaller. Earlier this year, Mr. Noto began looking for a merger partner, approaching British Petroleum, Amoco and Conoco. In August, though, when British Petroleum announced its $48 billion takeover of Amoco, his options narrowed considerably. And talks with Conoco were called off when it became clear that it would not be a good fit.</p>
        <p>And Exxon was surely even tougher for Mr. Noto to crack because of its size and because Mr. Raymond had always been wary of the uncertainties of a merger.</p>
        <p>Mr. Noto, however, is known for his persuasive powers. Two years ago, he put together a joint marketing and refining venture with British Petroleum that has led to the shedding of thousands of jobs and the saving of about $500 million a year in costs, a move that prompted other oil majors to form similar ventures.</p>
        <p>The idea of a merger was born, Mr. Raymond said in the interview yesterday, during lower-level talks earlier this year about combining refining operations in Japan. When he and Mr. Noto attended a meeting together in June, Mr. Raymond brought up those talks and said, ''Maybe we should talk about that.''</p>
        <p>To which Mr. Noto responded, ''That and other things.'' Within three weeks, the two were talking about far closer ties.</p>
        <p>The two companies, Mr. Noto stressed, have many things in common, including not basing ''our strategy on what is popular today.''</p>
        <p>As soon as he took charge at Mobil, Mr. Noto made it clear that even though Mobil had already eliminated 15,000 jobs the previous five years, the belt-tightening had just begun. ''The challenge is how do you run the company the way you think it should be run and still have enough of an eye on the short-term considerations, like the shareholders?'' he said in an interview shortly before he took over.</p>
        <p>He was determined to make Mobil more profitable and make shareholders happy, a goal analysts say he achieved. He set out to cut another 15,000 jobs and to pass down more power to middle management to shake Mobil out of its doldrums.</p>
        <p>But simply cutting jobs would not be enough for Mobil or Exxon, which has also seen significant job cuts. Both Mr. Noto and Mr. Raymond faced the daunting task of finding huge new fields of oil and natural gas to replace dwindling reserves. Both pinned high hopes on the opening of Russia and other former Soviet-bloc countries, but economic and political realities soon derailed those dreams.</p>
        <p>That left even a strong company like Exxon, which has been slow to replace reserves, wondering where it would strike oil next.</p>
        <p>Further complicating the industry's future has been the impact of global warming -- an issue that Mr. Raymond has not been afraid to tackle. He has insisted, for example, that the phenomenon had not been proved scientifically. And recently, when he was chairman of the American Petroleum Institute, the industry trade group, he was the point man in trying to head off attempts to limit emissions of carbon dioxide, which would almost surely force industries to cut down on oil consumption.</p>
        <p>And he has not been afraid to be blunt about it, causing an uproar with his views at a meeting of the World Petroleum Congress last year.</p>
        <p>''Some people seemed astonished that someone would actually stand up in public and point out some of the scientific uncertainties and damaging economic consequences of the proposals under discussion,'' he said at last year's meeting of the American Petroleum Institute.</p>
        <p>In dealing with the varied groups claiming damages from the Exxon Valdez spill off Alaska in 1989, he has often taken a tough line to keep claims down. He was also willing to take the heat for having Exxon go through the continuing long and costly appeal of a $5 billion jury award in the case, even though many people say Exxon should simply pay it.</p>
        <p>As for today's challenges, Mr. Noto and Mr. Raymond might be the ideal team. Mr. Noto was in Saudi Arabia from 1977 to 1985, making friends with some current Saudi leaders, and  Mr. Raymond has the resources and skills to put projects together. Between them, they may find a way back into the country that by far has the largest oil reserves in the world.</p>
