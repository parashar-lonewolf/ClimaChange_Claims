        <p>LEAD: Scientists seeking to mine the huge trove of data gathered at great risk and expense in 30 years of space flight have found that much of it is so badly labeled or stored that extracting useful information can require years of ingenious detective work.</p>
        <p>Scientists seeking to mine the huge trove of data gathered at great risk and expense in 30 years of space flight have found that much of it is so badly labeled or stored that extracting useful information can require years of ingenious detective work.</p>
        <p>The results can be well worth the effort. For example, scientists working with 10-year-old data recently constructed the clearest picture yet of the biggest volcano on Mars. And scientists planning future lunar missions are sifting through data recorded in the mid-1960's to produce detailed pictures of the dark side of the Moon.</p>
        <p>But it can take the frustrated researchers months and even years to pry useful information from the hundreds of thousands of magnetic tapes on which it is stored. Many of the tapes are uncatalogued. Some have been damaged by heat or floods.</p>
        <p>Even tapes in good condition may be missing the documents needed to decode them. Others are so old that computer experts no longer understand how they were programmed. Still others can be processed only on machinery so outdated that little of the necessary hardware remains.</p>
        <p>Even the tapes that were properly stored contain so much information that scientists are only beginning to catalogue it and put it on modern computer tapes and more advanced storage systems.</p>
        <p>But even as they work their way through this enormous amount of material, much more lies ahead. The new ''Mission to Planet Earth'' program of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is expected to generate more data in a day than has been generated by the entire previous history of the space program.</p>
        <p>''These data are a national treasure,'' said Arthur I. Zygielbaum, manager of the Science Information Systems Office at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory here. ''Our goal should be to save everything. Without tomorrow's context we don't know what is valuable today.'' The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, he said, is cataloguing its primary collection of about 200,000 space mission tapes, which are wound on 12-inch reels and stored in airtight metal cannisters. The tapes contain information on long-term trends like global climate change, tropical deforestation and the thinning of the atmospheric ozone layer, Mr. Zygielbaum said, as well as nuggets of information about the Moon and planets.</p>
        <p>But the tapes' greatest value, researchers say, may lie in the light they can shed on scientific questions that have not yet been posed. For example, NASA scientists ignored ozone data gathered on space flights in the 1970's because the readings were so low they thought they were erroneous, Mr. Zygielbaum said. In the 1980's, after British scientists suggested that a dangerous thinning of the ozone layer was under way, NASA scientists were able to confirm the observation from the old data.</p>
        <p>Similarly, in light of new theories about life originating in a medium of clay and water, a scientist recently went looking for evidence of clay on Mars and found it in old data.</p>
        <p>Fifty years from now a scientist might come up with a theory about gravity waves and go looking for them in old Voyager data, said Edward Ng of the laboratory's information systems office. In science, he said, ''one man's noise is another man's signal.''</p>
        <p>But sorting out what's on the tapes and putting it into usable form is a daunting enterprise. Two years ago, for example, Eric Eliason of the United States Geological Survey learned that more than 3,000 images from the Viking mission to Mars, obtained in the late 1970's, had never been processed from the master data record, the unprocessed data transmitted from the spacecraft.</p>
        <p>Data Tapes as Puzzles</p>
        <p>After tracking down the data, Mr. Eliason looked up the NASA documents that described how theywere entered. ''It was written in technical jargon,'' he said. ''Maybe it was clear to the person who wrote it but it was not clear to me 20 years later.''</p>
        <p>There were copies of some old computer programs used to turn the raw data into pictures, he said, but the source codes the computer needed to run the programs could not be found and the computers themselves no longer existed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Eliason then approached the data tapes as if they were encrypted puzzles. ''I tried to make sense of the raw data but in the first image I processed, all the pixels were backwards,'' said Mr. Eliason, referring to the tiny squares on a grid that make up a photographic image.</p>
        <p>''I knew the images were in there somewhere,'' Mr. Eliason continued, ''so I talked to the old guys'' who designed the camera and other instruments. In this way Mr. Eliason learned that the Viking tape recorder ran forward and backward, so that data was encoded forward and backward as well. ''It took me months to learn all the intricacies of the data,'' he said.</p>
        <p>After a year, Mr. Eliason succeded in writing a computer program that can extract the missing images of Mars. And last year, more than a decade after the Viking cameras collected data, he found the highest resolution image ever taken of Mons Olympus, the most signficant feature on Mars and the largest volcano in the solar system.</p>
        <p>In planning new missions to the Moon, scientists hope to reprocess lunar orbiter photographs taken in the mid-1960's, said Nancy Evans, a spokeswoman for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. But the photographs, developed on board the spacecraft, had been transmitted to Earth in a high-density format used by a model of Ampex Corporation tape reader that has not been manufactured for 25 years. At the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's request, Ampex began searching for one of them.</p>
        <p>Searching Computer Junkyards</p>
        <p>After hunting for more than a year, the company found a machine at Eglin Air Force Base, Fla., Ms. Evans said. Last month it was shipped to the laboratory. Technicians there are still looking in computer junkyards for one missing part but if they cannot find it they will rebuild them from scratch. The goal is to read the tapes and transform their data into a modern digital signal so that the high-resolution Moon images can be manipulated in modern computers into three-dimensional images and moving pictures. NASA scientists often grab data and put it aside, intending to process it later, Mr. Eliason said. But sometimes the mission financing runs out and the processing never gets finished.</p>
        <p>Despite the recent effort to preserve tapes at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA officials have not been taking proper care of the bulk of their magnetic tape holdings gleaned from more than 260 scientific missions, according to a recent audit by the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress. Hundreds of thousands of the agency's 1.2 million tapes are currently kept under ''deplorable conditions'' at various NASA facilties, said Ronald W. Beers, assistant manager of the accounting office's information management and technology division. NASA has not performed an agency-wide inventory of its magnetic tapes, he said, and does not know what data are retained and what may have been lost.</p>
        <p>Stored properly, magnetic tapes can last indefinitely, said Mr. Beers. But at several NASA storage facilities, including a warehouse recently used by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, tapes were found stacked on pallets, strapped down with steel bands and left in rooms where the temperature reached 100 degrees. Under those conditions, said Mr. Beers, tapes might not last 10 years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zygielbaum agreed that some tapes had been kept in substandard storage. Last summer, he said, 135,000 tapes were moved to a new location where they are being sorted and evaluated for archiving. Only two of the tapes were physically damaged, he said, so it appears that ''virtually no data from past J.P.L. planetary misssions have been lost.''</p>
        <p>The laboratory is in the process of archiving these tapes, which contain the data from about two dozen missions, said Michael Sanders, a scientist involved in the effort. It is also developing advanced technologies to distribute the data to scientists, including information about the scientific instruments flown, computer programs run, and a host of other factors used to analyze the data, so the tapes will be preserved in their full context.</p>
        <p>Easy-to-Store Disks</p>
        <p>To begin the project, four researchers are poring over 135,000 old magnetic tapes saved from lunar and planetary missions throughout the 1960's and 1970's. Another 50,000 tapes from the more recent Voyager missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are in the process of being transferred onto special laser disks that are easy to store and copy and are virtually indestructable.</p>
        <p>The older tapes are being sorted into data sets, with each set representing a separate space flight, said Amy Hochstettler, the researcher in charge. Some of the earliest missions produced only one tape, she said, whereas later sets have at least 50,000 tapes.</p>
        <p>Special Programs Needed</p>
        <p>Once full data sets of each mission have been compiled, Ms. Hochstettler said, the researchers will transfer the old data, bit by bit, onto new tape. This is a tricky business, she said. Older tapes are in a seven-track format and cannot be run on modern nine-track machines. So researchers must write special computer programs to copy the data onto modern tapes.</p>
        <p>But the biggest problem, said Ms. Hochstettler, is that some of the original tapes are so fragile that the layer of oxidized fiber that contains the data flakes off as the tape is read. These tapes are destroyed in the copying process and if something goes wrong the data they contain are lost forever.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the laboratory hopes to have a collection of 10,000 to 15,000 tapes representing the core of its planetary missions, said Mr. Sanders. But, he said, the tapes will not be useful to future scientists without vast amounts of ancillary data. This includes computer instructions for running the programs to process the data, spacecraft specifications and a great many details about the instruments flown on each mission. Sometimes, Mr. Sanders said, researchers must find the people who built each instrument, if they are still alive, to learn the details of their design.</p>
        <p>Finally, scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory are developing new technologies to make better use of archived data. More data are being made available to scientists on compact disks as well as through a special computer network associated with six universities. Without new tools, Mr. Sanders said, NASA scientists will not be able to cope with the flood of data.</p>
