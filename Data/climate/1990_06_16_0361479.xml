        <p>LEAD: Reef rangers prowl the depths here, armed with grease pencils, plastic slates and scuba tanks, ticketing any who abuse the fragile coral heads that make up the third largest barrier reef in the world and the only one in the continental United States.</p>
        <p>Reef rangers prowl the depths here, armed with grease pencils, plastic slates and scuba tanks, ticketing any who abuse the fragile coral heads that make up the third largest barrier reef in the world and the only one in the continental United States.</p>
        <p>But the rangers' battle is proving to be a tough one.</p>
        <p>Here on a 220-mile-long stretch of open sea, oceangoing vessels plow into the 7,000-year-old reef several miles off the coast, their hulls pulverizing acres of lush coral growth, reducing a living reef to stark whiteness.</p>
        <p>Skin divers cut the coral for souvenirs. Boats drop and drag anchors, breaking off coral branches and toppling heads of coral, huge clumps that have taken hundreds of years to grow.</p>
        <p>The once-teeming reefs have been overfished, and the Florida spiny lobster is less abundant. Many scientists say pollution, global warming and rising sea levels are combining to retard coral growth, which is normally slow, Other natural curses, like black band disease and the loss of the long-spined urchins that once cleaned the coral of algae, have dealt further blows to the reef track of 6,000 small barrier reefs extending from Miami south along the Florida Keys to Dry Tortugas.</p>
        <p>Ban on Oil Drilling Sought</p>
        <p>Scientists and reef rangers believe reducing the impact of humans on the reef might give the coral a better chance for regrowth. Along with stepped-up enforcement of existing laws, ecologists are pressing President Bush for a permanant ban on oil drilling off Florida's coast. A decision is expected in the next few weeks.</p>
        <p>At the same time, environmentalists are urging Congress to create a 150-mile buffer zone around the Florida reef to force large ships farther out to sea. As many as 5,000 oil tankers pass along Florida's coast each year, and southbound ships tend to hug the coastline close to the reef as they try to avoid strong northerly currents.</p>
        <p>Those who make their living from the reef realize that more regulations may be in store to give hard-hit areas of coral a chance to recover. Paul Caputo, a dive shop and charter boat operator here, said he applauded the the rangers' efforts.</p>
        <p>''They've had the laws for years but never enforced them,'' he said. ''There are too many of us living here, too much development on the Keys. And there are so many divers they have an impact. That's where you need more education.''</p>
        <p>Divers who touch coral are instructed to surface by rangers with messages written on slates with grease pencils. Once above water, the divers usually receive $25 tickets.</p>
        <p>Rangers say more drastic measures, like fencing off coral areas, are unrealistic because of the size of the reef and because they would defeat the purpose of having the coral in parks - to encourage divers to enjoy the reef's beauty, though at a distance. Responsible divers are compared by rangers to hikers in a woodland.</p>
        <p>Not Enough Controls</p>
        <p>Less than 18 percent of the reef ecosystem, which includes mangroves and seagrass banks and which is larger than the state of Delaware, is under the control of government agencies as part of the national sanctuary program or the national or state parks systems. Many officials say having the entire area under government control would make it easier to manage and regulate.</p>
        <p>Lieut. Michael W. White, manager of the Key Largo National Marine Sanctuary, said he had a wish list for better management of the reef. ''I would like to see some kind of boat operators' license and education; a very basic knowledge of reading charts and learning the rules of the road,'' he said. ''Boat groundings are a main problem. Some of these people cannot recognize shallow water. Some don't know where they are most of the time.''</p>
        <p>Around the popular diving areas are permanent mooring buoys, allowing people to tie their boats to moorings rather than drop anchors. Lieutenant White would welcome regulations that allowed only the buoy moorings; this would limit the numbers of visitors to an area and let damaged areas to recover undisturbed.</p>
        <p>Billy Causey, manager of the Looe Key National Marine Sanctuary, stressed the importance of education above and below sea level, saying, ''People are prone to be unaware of the damage they can do particularly when they stand up in a very fragile area on coral branches, causing damage in some cases that is irreparable.''</p>
        <p>Conditions for Survival</p>
        <p>All this may come as too little too late. Coral reefs thrive in a very small range of temperatures and depths. The reefs are on the most northerly edge of the Caribbean range. At times, the winter water temperatures are too cold and, in the summer months, the water is too hot, killing certain species.</p>
        <p>All this slows the growth of the coral polyp, the basic building block of the coral reef. The polyp is a brainless, eyeless, immobile animal about the size of an aspirin whose hard exterior skeleton forms the coral colony, building atop the skeletons of hundreds of the polyp's ancestors, ancestors that in the case of the Florida reef died 150,000 years ago. Massive coral heads of polyps grow four to five millimeters a year. These heads have been growing for 7,000 years atop the old reef.</p>
        <p>Marine biologists have had some success with repairing these heads after they have been broken in ship groundings. The coral die within a few days but if divers can get there soon enough to cement the pieces together, the colony will survive.</p>
        <p>But the task of repairing just one coral head is daunting. It means joining broken pieces of coral that weigh hundreds of pounds under water.</p>
        <p>''It's like trying to replant all the trees after a tornado,'' said Mark Eakin, a doctoral candidate at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science.</p>
