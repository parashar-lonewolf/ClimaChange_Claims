        <p>There is a fad among young people on the Paris club scene of wearing T-shirts with L.E.D. displays across the chest, which blare messages like ''Hot Lips.'' You might as well say: ''Look at me. I'm lame.'' In a city that is becoming increasingly neon, pitch-dark little boutiques with names like Boutique HO! and Uranium Jeans have popped up, selling battery-operated novelty belts, hats and underwear, all of which seems an incredibly wasteful affront to the environment.</p>
        <p>Technology has changed the way designers approach fashion, but none of them are so utterly unconscious or nihilistic as to endorse such polluting nonsense. The recent work of Hussein Chalayan has become more and more pointed about the functional possibilities of ''smart'' designer clothes, and in the subtly nuanced collection he showed on Wednesday, Mr. Chalayan offered metaphors about climate change and fears of global warming. Crystal dresses powered by microchips displayed a video of the changing seasons; a woven wool samurai-style coat sprouted a black bubble hood; and a bodysuit mechanically blossomed into a printed ball-gown skirt. He is a bit like the Al Gore of fashion: it took a while for people to get his message.</p>

        <p>Technology has changed the way designers approach fashion, but none of them are so utterly unconscious or nihilistic as to endorse such polluting nonsense. The recent work of Hussein Chalayan has become more and more pointed about the functional possibilities of ''smart'' designer clothes, and in the subtly nuanced collection he showed on Wednesday, Mr. Chalayan offered metaphors about climate change and fears of global warming. Crystal dresses powered by microchips displayed a video of the changing seasons; a woven wool samurai-style coat sprouted a black bubble hood; and a bodysuit mechanically blossomed into a printed ball-gown skirt. He is a bit like the Al Gore of fashion: it took a while for people to get his message.</p>
        <p>The news of the Paris shows has centered most conspicuously on voluminous coats, many in big bell shapes, which were well suited to the playful romp at Stella McCartney. She opened her show with a series of topiary shag coats made of tufted yarn with little strips buzzed away. Then she sent out models practically in pajamas under an oversize man's coat and in boyfriend sweaters with angular dropped shoulders. An adult onesie with a Nordic pattern of polar bears and snowflakes veered toward cutesy, but Ms. McCartney's eye for creating a frenetic feminine line underneath volume has grown more astute, most notably in an abbreviated black tuxedo jacket, which gamboled over a curvy black dress with a ruffled hem.</p>
        <p>Giambattista Valli, who is becoming an important name, designed coats that were voluminous and nicely tailored with draped panels, which billowed away from the body. His suits, worn with bulbous pilgrim hats, were long and lean down to the knees and then wide at the ankles, making a creepily beautiful outline that would be at home in a Tim Burton film. And Mr. Valli made interesting work of ruffles in deceptively simple blouses, as in a black silk number with ruffles trailing down the spine.</p>
        <p>Christian Lacroix veered way off course with shrink-wrapped gowns on models wearing bizarre antennae, which bounced along as they stomped down his garish blue runway. An Op Art suit with a bib of scraggly goat fur made Natasha Poly look like a bearded lady. Absolutely Fatuous.</p>
        <p>In another oddity, the program notes for Peter Dundas's show for Emanuel Ungaro read like a personals ad: ''I have always loved nightclubbing.'' Really? Me too! But not in any blind-me-with-crystals sexpot dress with electric blue tiger stripes, hot lips.</p>
