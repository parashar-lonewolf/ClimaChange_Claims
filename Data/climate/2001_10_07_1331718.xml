        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''Priorities in the Wake of a Shattered Taboo'' (Economic View,  Sept. 23) Louis Uchitelle observed that the events of Sept. 11 would  almost certainly shatter a nearly quarter-century of de-emphasis of government spending.</p>
        <p>I agree with him that child care would be one good beneficiary of increased public spending, but I would also propose a national rail system. If recent events did not do enough to highlight the airlines' vulnerability, the necessity of increased security will certainly put a significant drag on any rebound they have.</p>
        <p>If we created a national system of tracks and licensed private companies to operate on it (with government operating or subsidizing less profitable runs), our transportation situation would be vastly improved.  Other countries have high-speed passenger trains; why can't we?</p>
        <p>The railroads were once an engine of American economic growth. In an era when we must deal with declining oil supplies, global warming and  issues of national security, there is no reason that railroads can't assume that role again.</p>
