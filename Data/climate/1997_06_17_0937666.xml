        <p>FIVE years ago, in the largest gathering of its kind in history, world leaders meeting at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro signed binding treaties designed to prevent dangerous human interference with the earth's climate system and to protect living species. They also adopted a nonbinding blueprint to guide countries in protecting a deteriorating global environment while at the same time promoting economic well-being.</p>
        <p>Next Monday, 70 heads of state or government will gather at the United Nations to take stock of progress since Rio and to discuss where to go from here. But United Nations reports prepared for the meeting have already rendered a judgment: with some important exceptions, environmental trends have changed little since the Rio gathering.</p>
        <p>The most notable exception, interestingly, is in an area not dealt with at Rio: population growth. Thanks to factors like contraception, education and the enhanced status of women, fertility rates are declining more rapidly than had been expected in all regions of the world. The latest United Nations projections show that the populations of many countries, including some developing ones, will stabilize within the next generation or two. But other countries still face high growth rates that will strain their resources, and the world population as a whole is expected to reach 11 billion before stabilizing some time in the 21st century. It now totals about 6 billion.</p>
        <p>At the same time, according to the United Nations assessment, food production continues to rise, and most people are living longer and healthier lives. These gains are threatened, however, by a growing scarcity of fresh water and a loss of topsoil and productive farmland. According to the United Nations accounting, a third of the world's people do not have an adequate supply of clean water, and two-thirds will be deprived of it by 2010 unless action is taken. Some 3.7 billion acres of farmland -- nearly 30 percent of the world's vegetated surface -- are now degraded to some degree.</p>
        <p>Air and water quality is generally improving in rich countries. But despite substantial reforestation in those countries and a recent slowing of deforestation globally, forest loss continues worldwide. Each year, according to the United Nations, an area the size of Nepal is cut or burned. Ocean pollution threatens the health and livelihood of the two-thirds of humanity living near coastlines, and about 60 percent of commercial fisheries are overfished or fully fished and in danger of depletion. Toxic chemicals still pose significant threats.</p>
        <p>Under the two binding treaties signed at Rio, substantive progress has been scant.  The Convention on Biodiversity has been ratified by 161 countries (not including the United States). This treaty obligates governments to take action to protect plant and animal species, but species are being extinguished and their habitats are being destroyed at what the United Nations calls an ''unprecedented'' rate.</p>
        <p>The climate treaty has been ratified by 166 countries, including the United States.  But few developed countries, also including the United States, are expected to meet the treaty's initial goal of capping emissions of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide at 1990 levels by 2000. Despite that, talks are under way on even stronger steps that would further reduce emissions of the gases.  Two more sessions of the talks are scheduled in Bonn before a final session in Kyoto, Japan, in December.</p>
        <p>As the negotiations proceed, atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide continue to grow, and mainstream scientists say that if they are not reduced the world can expect a warmer climate and widespread climatic disruption in the next century.</p>
        <p>On this page are snapshots of some major aspects of the global environmental picture.</p>
