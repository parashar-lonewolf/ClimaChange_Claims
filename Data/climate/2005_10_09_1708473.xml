        <p>To commemorate its 35th year, Foreign Policy magazine asked 16 well-known thinkers to ''speculate on the ideas, values and institutions the world takes for granted that may disappear in the next 35 years.''</p>
        <p>One decisive response came from Peter Singer, the Princeton philosopher, who wrote that ''the traditional view of the sanctity of human life will collapse under pressure from scientific, technological and demographic developments.''</p>

        <p>To commemorate its 35th year, Foreign Policy magazine asked 16 well-known thinkers to ''speculate on the ideas, values and institutions the world takes for granted that may disappear in the next 35 years.''</p>
        <p>One decisive response came from Peter Singer, the Princeton philosopher, who wrote that ''the traditional view of the sanctity of human life will collapse under pressure from scientific, technological and demographic developments.''</p>
        <p>Richard N. Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, was almost as pessimistic about the future of national sovereignty:</p>
        <p>Nation-states will not disappear, but they will share power with  corporations, nongovernmental organizations, terrorists groups, drug cartels, regional and global institutions and banks and private equity funds. Sovereignty will fall victim to the powerful and accelerating flow of people, ideas, greenhouse gases, goods, dollars, drugs, viruses, e-mails and weapons within and across borders. All of this traffic challenges one of the fundamentals of sovereignty: the ability to control what crosses borders. Sovereign states will increasingly measure their vulnerability not to one another but to forces of globalization beyond their control.</p>
        <p>Implicit in all this is the notion that sovereignty is conditional, even contractual, rather than absolute. If a state sponsors terrorism, develops weapons of mass destruction or conducts genocide, then it forfeits the normal benefits of sovereignty and opens itself up to attack, removal or occupation.</p>
        <p>No-Go Carts</p>
        <p>Why won't shopping carts go where shoppers point them? Matt Palmquist explains in the September-October issue of Chow magazine.</p>
        <p>Most U.S. shopping carts are equipped with front caster wheels, not unlike those on a desk chair, which can swivel in any direction. Sometimes all four of the wheels are swiveling casters, which makes the cart almost too maneuverable and hard to push around corners. More often, a cart's back wheels are fixed to roll straight. But because carts see such high traffic, are pushed over hazardous floors and are frequently the victims of aisle rage, it's easy for the metal base of the cart to become bent. When that happens to a fixed-rear-wheel vehicle, the driver's own force has to make up for the cart's wayward path. Proper weight distribution will help you steer: load the heaviest items in the back, above the rear-wheel axis.</p>
        <p>Dating vs. Love</p>
        <p>The fall issue of the magazine N+1 contains an unsigned essay called ''Dating,'' which suggests that the mating ritual is a hopeless but unavoidable activity.</p>
        <p>Dating presents itself as an education in human relationships. In fact, it's an anti-education. You could invent no worse preparation for love, for marriage, than the tireless pursuit of the perfect partners. Keep Looking, says dating. You're Not Done Yet. What About That One? And That One? Dating, like the tyrant, seeks perfections (within a certain price range).</p>
        <p>Whereas the heart, like the eye, can only cling to imperfections: her funny stride, and the way her voice breaks, child-like, on the phone. And so the dater, self-baffling, seeks what the heart cannot understand.</p>
        <p>More Lawyers=More Jokes  The Times Literary Supplement reviews ''Lowering the Bar: Lawyer Jokes and Legal Culture,'' by Marc Galanter, which examines why, as seen in their jokes, Americans hate lawyers. The review, by E.S. Turner, is available at www.the-tls.co.uk/this--week/story.aspx?story--id=2112044.</p>
        <p>A favorite American riddle runs: ''What do you call 600 lawyers at the bottom of the sea?'' The answer is ''A good start.''</p>
        <p>In Galanter's words, the American public had chosen lawyers as a screen on which to project their animosities. But why?</p>
        <p>It was no surprise that the expansion of prejudice coincided with the huge increases in lawyer numbers over recent decades. The reason for the rise in numbers Galanter attributes to ''the increasing legalization of society'' expressed in ''a decentralized legal regime in which any activity is subject to multiple bodies of regulation ''</p>
        <p>Was there ever a better specification for a lawyers' paradise? Americans tolerate this system, it appears, because they ''rely more on law (and correspondingly less on government) as a vehicle of justice.''</p>
