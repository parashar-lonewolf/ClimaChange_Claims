        <p>VERYONE knows that cars contribute to smog. But what if you had one that actually reduced pollution as you drove?

        <p>VERYONE knows that cars contribute to smog. But what if you had one that actually reduced pollution as you drove? For five years, that has been the tantalizing promise of a technology developed by the Engelhard Corporation. Now, after some initial disappointments, Engelhard's ''smog-eating radiator'' is finding its way into new cars.</p>
        <p>The technology will be used at first in all Volvo S80 sedans and V70 wagons for the 2000 model year. It will also appear on this year's ultra-low-emission Nissan Sentra CA (for Clean Air), sold only in California.</p>
        <p>Engelhard, based in Iselin, N.J., calls its development PremAir. It is a coating applied to standard automotive radiators. Its manufacturer, which supplies catalytic converters to many carmakers, says that a radiator coated with the PremAir catalyst can capture as much as 75 percent of the ground-level ozone, the main component in smog, that passes through it, converting it to ordinary oxygen.</p>
        <p>The company declines to identify the composition of its coating, but says it includes a nonprecious-metal catalyst that acts in much the same way as the precious metals in catalytic converters to force a chemical reaction and neutralize pollution.</p>
        <p>PremAir has its share of skeptics. Roland Hwang, a transportation analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists in Berkeley, Calif., said results would vary widely depending on whether there was any ozone present to be broken down.</p>
        <p>''We see the Engelhard catalyst as a bit of a gimmick,'' he said. ''It's something the auto companies will use to try and gain some environmental points.''</p>
        <p>PremAir was first announced in 1995, and quickly drew attention from the Ford Motor Company, which spent a year helping to develop an earlier version of the coating. Engelhard initially contended that widespread use of PremAir in Los Angeles would do more for the city's air quality than the combined benefits of electric cars, reformulated gasoline and reduced driving, and its stock soared 66 percent over the next three months.</p>
        <p>Engelhard later said testing had shown that the catalyst's environmental benefits were ''less than originally projected'' and the stock dropped.</p>
        <p>Ford abandoned its involvement in PremAir in 1996. ''Our analysis showed that it was a pretty expensive way to get a small benefit,'' Terry Bresnihan, a spokesman for Ford, said.</p>
        <p>PremAir's promise was further clouded at that time by a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of some Engelhard executives who had sold $19 million worth of company stock in 1995 before the share price dropped. The S.E.C. issued subpoenas for some company documents and conducted interviews with staff members during 1996, but no charges were filed.</p>
        <p>One reason PremAir appears to have bounced back is that the system's costs have fallen sharply, from what the company estimated to be $500 a car in 1995 to less than $50 today.</p>
        <p>The main reason for this, said Mark Dresner, vice president of communications at Engelhard, is that earlier versions of PremAir used platinum, which is very expensive, as the catalytic agent. A platinum catalyst would have also allowed PremAir to convert carbon monoxide in the air to carbon dioxide, he added.</p>
        <p>Another reason for renewed interest in PremAir is that installation of the technology can help carmakers meet strict clean air standards in California and other states, including New York and Massachusetts, that follow California's lead.</p>
        <p>Richard Varenchik, a spokesman for the California Air Resources Board, said a 1998 addition to the board's rules granted low-emission-vehicle credits to auto manufacturers able to demonstrate that the PremAir system works effectively; those credits can be applied to a particular model to improve its overall treatment under C.A.R.B. guidelines.</p>
        <p>But the California rules require on-board monitoring of emissions-control equipment, which is lacking in Volvo's current version of the system. ''We haven't seen it up and running on a car,'' Mr. Varenchik said. ''C.A.R.B. doesn't know how effective the system will be, or how much ozone it will destroy. The carmakers have to demonstrate to us that it works, and they have to guarantee it for seven years or 70,000 miles.''</p>
        <p>Volvo, a division of Ford, has been investigating and testing the system for three years, said Peter Halling, the company's New Jersey-based director of regulatory compliance and environmental affairs.</p>
        <p>''From our tests, we concluded that this technology works very well, and we decided to put it on our cars now,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Volvo estimates that on particularly hot, smoggy days, PremAir could actually consume more ozone than the car generates. PremAir will appear on S80 and V70 models being shipped worldwide, he said, and the company is considering whether to use the catalyst in its new, compact V40 wagon and S40 sedan.</p>
        <p>Ford is also reconsidering the system it rejected five years ago. Mr. Bresnihan says that ''the technology is better now, and Ford is being asked to go after smaller and smaller increments of pollution.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Terence C. Poles, Engelhard's director of new ventures, said PremAir could also be deployed with any automotive air-conditioning system, so its use was not limited to cars with internal-combustion engines. ''If you put it on an electric car, the result would be a negative-pollution vehicle,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Like many environmental groups, the Union of Concerned Scientists favors pollution prevention over solutions that occur after the pollution has come out of the tailpipe.</p>
        <p>''Driving around to clean up the air is not our favorite approach,'' Mr. Hwang said.</p>
        <p>Correction:  February 10, 2000, Thursday  An article in the Automobiles section on Jan. 14 about a Volvo car radiator that is said to reduce pollution misattributed a statement by a company executive. It was William Shapiro, director of regulatory compliance and environmental affairs for Volvo Cars of North America, who said the company had been investigating and testing the technology for three years. It was not Petter Halling, who works in environmental communication for Volvo in Sweden. Mr. Shapiro reported the error on Jan. 17, but his letter was misdirected at The Times.</p>
