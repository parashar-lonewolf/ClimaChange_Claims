        <p>LEAD: Objections by the United States, Japan and the Soviet Union at an international conference here thwarted endorsement today of a specific timetable for curbs on emissions of carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>Objections by the United States, Japan and the Soviet Union at an international conference here thwarted endorsement today of a specific timetable for curbs on emissions of carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>The dissidents among the 68 nations participating agreed, however, that stabilizing carbon dioxide emissions in industrialized countries would have to be enforced at some point. William K. Reilly, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, who led the Amer=ican delegation, said it was the first time the United States had embraced the principle.</p>
        <p>Excess carbon dioxide, produced largely by burning coal, petroleum and natural gas, is responsible for at least half the atmospheric pollution that traps solar heat like a greenhouse and contributes to atmospheric warming. Issue of Climate Change</p>
        <p>The conference, bringing together environment officials for two days of non-binding discussions, was called to consider the problem of climate change. Western European nations had hoped for a final declaration that would commit the participants to limiting carbon dioxide emissions to an agreed level by the year 2000. Most countries wanted to set the level at the carbon dioxide produced in the industrial world in 1988, and many wanted consideration of cuts of up to 20 percent in the agreed level by 2005.</p>
        <p>In Washington, President Bush was sharply criticized by members of Congress from both parties, including the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell, Democrat of Maine, and Senator John Heinz, Republican of Pennsylvania, for resisting the action on global warming that other countries wanted. The President said today in a news conference that the United States cannot be driven by ''the extremes'' of a policy that calls for a carbon dioxide stabilization or reduction timetable.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly made clear yesterday that the Bush Administration's policy was to avoid specifics at least until the United Nations-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change makes its final report next November.</p>
        <p>In the debate about carbon dioxide levels, Japan has generally sided with the United States in calling for further study before decisive action. The Soviet Union and other East European nations have opposed limits on the grounds that they do not have the money to spend on meeting them.</p>
        <p>In the United States, the adoption of carbon dioxide limits would probably mean laws requiring more fuel-efficient automobiles, use of fluorescent rather than incandescent light bulbs and extensive tree planting. Later, new methods would have to be developed to produce power without coal or oil.</p>
        <p>Most of the debate was over one paragraph stating the conference's view on curbing carbon dioxide emissions in industrialized countries. In the end the declaration stated that stabilization should be achieved at levels to be considered at the meeting next November.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists attending as observers said they were ''very disappointed'' by the declaration. ''Less than six months ago in Paris, President Bush talked of the urgent need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions,'' said Brooks Yeager of the National Audubon Society. ''Now the White House has sabotaged the first international effort to make good on the President's words. This is not the way to lead the world.''</p>
