      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Re ''Must Speed Process of Meeting Energy Needs'' [letter, Aug. 25]: the writer correctly points out that newer, gas-fired combined-cycle power projects are more efficient and environmentally preferable. But his assertion that Long Island needs more power plants is wrong. What should be done first is to refit Long Island's oldest and dirtiest power plants with improved technology.</p>
        <p>The inner components of old, polluting power plants would be replaced with newer combined-cycle technology. The facility's shell remains the same, but emissions of the dirtiest pollutants are reduced and efficiency and output are increased. A LIPA study analyzing the repowering of a unit at the Port Jefferson and Northport plants indicated nearly a doubling of power output while emission reductions of sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide exceeded 90 percent and carbon dioxide emissions were reduced 40 percent. A study by the Center for Management Analysis at Long Island University shows that the cost of repowering is less than that to build a similar plant elsewhere.</p>

        <p>Repowering saves money in the long term, reduces pollutants and increases output, eliminating the need for new power plants. Cleaning up our oldest and dirtiest generators must be our top priority. Repowering is a solution that makes sense for Long Island's energy future.</p>
