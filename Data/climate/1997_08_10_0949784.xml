        <p>As the New York State Legislature sleepily stumbled to the close of its 220th session at 3:40 P.M. on Aug. 4, party leaders in both houses rose to give valedictories expressing their abiding affection for their staffs, their colleagues, even their opponents.</p>
        <p>What they failed to mention were the nerve-jangling confrontations, the harsh invective and the simmering distrust that had been the session's real trademarks. This was not merely one of the Legislature's longest sessions ever -- 210 days, or seven months -- but also among its most contentious and least productive in recent years.</p>
        <p>The year began with a bruising fight over a proposal to amend the State Constitution to allow casino gambling in places other than Indian reservations. The measure had the support of Gov. George E. Pataki and the State Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno. But opposition from religious leaders, environmental groups and Donald Trump, the New Jersey casino owner, killed the measure in the Senate.</p>
        <p>The defining battle was over laws that limit rent increases on more than one million apartments in and around New York City. The laws were scheduled to expire on June 15, and Mr. Bruno, supported by landlord groups, had vowed to let the laws lapse unless Democrats agreed to scale back many tenant protections. After months of intense public relations campaigns by both sides, Mr. Pataki and the legislative leaders reached agreement shortly after midnight on June 16 to extend the laws, but with changes allowing landlords to charge significantly higher rents on vacant units.</p>
        <p>The Assembly passed 1,498 of the roughly 8,000 bills introduced into that house. The State Senate passed 1,418 of 5,793 bills. A total of 749 bills passed both houses. Of those, the Governor has signed 255 and vetoed 30. The remaining 464 bills are awaiting Mr. Pataki's decision on whether to sign them into law.</p>
        <p>The following were the major actions of the session.</p>
        <p>The Budget</p>
        <p>This year's budget was the latest in history, enacted 126 days after the April 1 start of the fiscal year, and it contained none of the austerity that was seen in Mr. Pataki's first two years in office or in the spending plan he proposed in January.</p>
        <p>Despite the tardiness, the budget was negotiated this year with considerably less rancor than in the previous two years; the fighting that delayed it was primarily over the state's rent regulations and the new welfare laws.</p>
        <p>The process was made easier by an extraordinary influx of cash, largely generated by the stock market boom, that led to a significant increase in spending.</p>
        <p>Overall spending, which includes Federal aid for programs like welfare and Medicaid, rose 4.2 percent, to $67.4 billion. The state-funds portion of the budget, financed by taxes, fees and tuition, rose 2.5 percent, to $45.1 billion. And spending from the state general fund, financed just by state taxes, rose 5.2 percent, to $34.6 billion, after declining slightly for two consecutive years.</p>
        <p>Most of the general fund increase was in aid to local school districts, which rose 7.3 percent, to $11 billion, the largest percentage increase since the 1980's.</p>
        <p>The Governor and the Legislature also locked the state into a series of school aid increases for prekindergarten education, smaller elementary class sizes, and other measures, that will, by 2001, cost an additional $1.5 billion a year.</p>
        <p>They also placed a $2.4 billion bond measure on the November ballot to build new schools and rehabilitate old ones.</p>
        <p>Lawmakers enacted a broad range of tax cuts, which will be worth $4.8 billion a year when fully implemented in 2001, but most of them will not take effect in this fiscal year.</p>
        <p>For the third straight year, the Legislature largely rejected Mr. Pataki's attempts to make deep cuts in Medicaid spending, the single biggest portion of the budget; indeed, when it became clear how much income tax revenue was pouring into the state's coffers, the Governor, himself, abandoned the proposed cuts.</p>
        <p>The Legislature also turned back the Governor's proposals for a $400-a-year increase in public college tuition and deep cuts in tuition aid to poor students.</p>
        <p>On welfare, the parameters were largely set by the Federal Government, which last year mandated a five-year lifetime limit on aid to families with children and required that the states place half of all recipients of Federal aid into work programs or work-related activities, like job training.</p>
        <p>The Legislature rejected Mr. Pataki's proposed cuts in Federal benefits. The Governor wanted to eliminate the state's cash assistance program for people who do not qualify for Federal aid, and replace it with a system of vouchers for basic needs. Instead, the changes enacted limited cash assistance to two years, followed by a combination of vouchers and cash.</p>
        <p>Taxes</p>
        <p>LEGISLATION ENACTED</p>
        <p>Lowers residential property taxes to support school systems by about 30 percent -- an average of about $500 a year for each homeowner, a total of $2.2 billion -- by 2001.</p>
        <p>Lowers the New York City income tax by 10 percent, or $62 a year for a person earning $36,000, by 2001.</p>
        <p>Extends for two years a 12.5 percent surcharge on the New York City income tax that has been used to pay for policing, which costs $78 a year for a person earning $36,000.</p>
        <p>Eliminates the gross receipts tax on hospitals, nursing homes and home care providers, saving $530 million a year by 2001.</p>
        <p>Lowers the gross receipts tax on utility bills by 30 percent, or $440 million a year, by 2001.</p>
        <p>Reduces estate taxes by a total of $440 million a year by 2001.</p>
        <p>Eliminates the 4 percent state sales tax on clothing, except shoes, up to $100 per article in 1999, for a total of $430 million a year.</p>
        <p>Increases the child care tax credit in 1999, primarily for low-  and middle-income families, raising the maximum credit to $536 a year from $211 a year for a two-income family earning $25,000 a year.</p>
        <p>Allows a family to exempt from personal income taxes money invested in a state-run fund for a child's college education. A family can invest up to $5,000 a year, up to a maximum of $100,000, in an investment account managed by the State Comptroller.</p>
        <p>Eliminates a 1-cent tax on drink bottles and cans.</p>
        <p>Eliminates the sales tax on coin-operated devices like vending machines, car washes and copying machines.</p>
        <p>LEGISLATION FAILED</p>

        <p>Places a measure on the November ballot that would authorize the state to spend $2.4 billion on repairing schools and constructing new ones.</p>
        <p>LEGISLATION FAILED</p>
        <p>Would have allowed parents, teachers and community groups to create small schools that are financed by taxpayers but independent of local school boards.</p>
        <p>Would have curbed state spending on special education by eliminating incentives that encourage schools to send children with mild problems to expensive and segregated classes.</p>
