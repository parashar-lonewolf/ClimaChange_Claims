        <p>Ancient Global Warming</p>
        <p>Global warming is often thought of as a product of the 20th century, the result of industrialization that has released more carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere. But in fact, the world has often gone through warm periods throughout its history. Now, there is new evidence to confirm one such warming spell -- more than 90,000 centuries ago.</p>
        <p>Researchers from the University of Rochester, digging in fossil beds in the Canadian Arctic that date back 90 million years, have discovered fish and turtles and, most important, the bones of several champsosaurs, a crocodile-like dinosaur.</p>
        <p>The champsosaur needed extended periods of warmth to survive and reproduce. Judging by the number and size of the specimens found, the researchers, writing in a recent issue of Science, estimate that the ancient Arctic must have been downright balmy, with summer temperatures in the 80's and 90's Fahrenheit, and winters that were rarely below freezing.</p>
        <p>The fossils date from a time that followed hard on the heels of a period of intense, worldwide volcanic activity that released huge amounts of carbon dioxide. Scientists had long thought that this period must have produced warmer temperatures, and the fossil find suggests that they are right.</p>
        <p>Perceptive Fish</p>
        <p>Most creatures judge distance by taking sensory readings of an object from different angles. The readings can be simultaneous from two or more sensory organs (a human's two, slightly separated, eyes, for example) or over time from a sole organ (like receptors on certain insects) as the creature moves.</p>
        <p>But biologists from Germany, France and Uruguay have discovered that a type of electric fish can judge distance with only one reading from a single group of receptors. It would be as if a human had great depth perception with one eye closed.</p>
        <p>The fish, a freshwater, nocturnal species found in Africa and South America, produces a weak electric field around it. Nearby objects distort the field, and the distortions are detected by electroreceptors on the fish's skin. In this way, the fish can ''see'' in complete darkness.</p>
        <p>The problem is, how does the fish determine if a slight distortion, say, is caused by an object that is close by, or by a larger object that is farther away?</p>
        <p>The solution, as determined by the researchers, is best envisioned by thinking of the distorted electric field as a shadow cast on the fish. In this model, an object that is close by  produces a shadow with sharply defined edges. An object that is farther away might produce the same size shadow, but the edges will be fuzzier. The fish is able to process these two qualities -- size of the distortion, plus how quickly the distortion changes at its edges -- to determine distance.</p>
        <p>New Import: Polluted Air</p>
        <p>Air pollution is the latest import from Asia, say scientists at the University of Washington who have tracked small but measurable amounts of carbon monoxide and other pollutants reaching the West Coast.</p>
        <p>Ordinarily, air coming from Asia is cleansed as it crosses the Pacific. But the researchers found that pollutants can make it directly across, particularly when there is a stable zone of low-pressure air over the Aleutians coupled with a high-pressure zone over Hawaii. The two air masses act like rollers in a conveyor belt, pulling the dirty air across the ocean in as few as four days.</p>
        <p>The researchers cannot yet pinpoint the source of the pollution within Asia. And they note that the imports pale in significance compared with pollution that is Made in the U.S.A. But they warn that the dirty air from Asia could increase with rapid industrial growth in the region.</p>
        <p>Honoring Dr. Chandra</p>
        <p>NASA is naming its new orbiting X-ray telescope after Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, the University of Chicago astrophysicist and Nobel laureate whose work on the evolution of stars pointed to the existence of black holes.</p>
        <p>Dr. Chandrasekhar, who died in 1995 at the age of 84, was known as Chandra to his colleagues. The Chandra Observatory is scheduled to be launched in April.</p>
