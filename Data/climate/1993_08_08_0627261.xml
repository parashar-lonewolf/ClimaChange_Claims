        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I greatly appreciate "Natural Limits" by Lester R. Brown, president of the Worldwatch Institute environmental research group (Op-Ed, July 24), concerning his organization's reports on declining food production rates. Certainly, this problem and population growth, its corollary, portend a frightening global problem.</p>
        <p>Such overviews, however, seldom emphasize the problem's relationship to petroleum supply. The disparity between grain production and population growth is compounded by the fact that our food production and distribution systems run largely on petroleum. We lack the technology to run these systems without it.</p>
        <p>Geological constraints and petroleum field discovery and production histories indicate that the global petroleum production rate is likely to reach its maximum and begin its permanent decline around the year 2020, just as United States petroleum production did in 1970.</p>
        <p>Even with startling new food-producing technology, it is difficult to envision how we could continue to increase world food production rates indefinitely as we come closer to depletion of the fuel necessary to run our food production and distribution systems. The food production and population explosions of the last century coincided with the explosion in burning of fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown surely is correct to suggest that the problem cannot be solved without population control. Unless human population declines by voluntary control to a size sustainable without the fossil fuel conflagration of recent decades, declining petroleum production rates could impose involuntary population decline by famine.
