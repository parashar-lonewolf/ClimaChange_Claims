        <p>Following are excerpts from part of the debate among the Democratic presidential candidates last night dealing with jobs and trade agreements, as transcribed by the Federal Document Clearing House:</p>
        <p>John Kerry</p>
        <p>Perhaps three or four years ago, I began talking about how it is critical that in any trade agreement, we now need to negotiate labor and trade, labor and environment standards. I will order a 120-day review of all of our trade agreements. We're going to see what's working, what isn't. I will not sign a trade agreement like the Central American Free Trade Agreement or the Free Trade of Americas Act that does not now embrace enforceable labor and environment standards. And we need to be creating more jobs here in the United States of America. I have a $50 billion package that I'll make available for manufacturing incentives and for relief for the states in order to help create the jobs we need in America, as well as a $4,000 tuition tax credit for kids to be able to go to college. We're going to refocus on science and technology on the United States. We're going to do the stem cell research and all of the other kinds of commitments to science that will advance the creation of jobs here at home.</p>

        <p>Howard Dean</p>
        <p>We've globalized the rights of big corporations to do business anywhere in the world. We did not globalize human rights, labor rights and environmental rights, and we need to do that. Now, with all due respect, I'm the only person up here who's ever balanced a budget, who's ever had the kind of agreements that we create jobs. Here's what we need to do: one, we've got to balance the budget. People do not invest in countries that don't balance their budgets. Two, we've got to do something to help small businesses and self-employed people. Small businesses and self-employed people create 70 percent of all the new jobs in America. We do virtually nothing for them. They need help with capital. They need help with health insurance. They need help with less paperwork. If you want jobs in America, instead of giving $3 trillion tax cuts to the wealthiest people in this country, what we ought to be doing is investing in mass transit, in schools, in renewable energy, and things that create jobs now and build infrastructure so we can have more jobs later on.</p>
        <p>Dennis J. Kucinich</p>
        <p>I'm the only one up here so far who's been willing to say that I'll cancel Nafta and the W.T.O. That's specific action that will regain real power for the American workers and for workers everywhere and to give the American people the ability to buy American-made goods. I mean, let's face it. It's either we buy America or it's bye-bye America. And I'm insisting that we have to provide a manufacturing base in this country so that people can have American-made goods to buy. They'll buy it if we make it here.</p>
        <p>Al Sharpton</p>
        <p>And the argument used that if you protect American workers it's protectionism, but if you protect American corporations it's patriotism -- I think it's patriotism to protect American workers. And I think that it is some kind of jaded proposition to say, Should Americans want to pay more to not get products at a Kmart from cheap labor, or even in some cases, slave labor abroad? That's, to me, as a descendant of slaves, like saying, Well, let's not end slavery because the product will be where we can afford it better. It is immoral; it is against our interests; it is outright indecent to work people around the world at those wages to justify Kmart prices.</p>
        <p>John Edwards</p>
        <p>The truth is, some of these jobs are gone. We are not going to get them back. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't change what we're doing. It doesn't mean the trade policy we are using now is working. These environmental and labor standards in the text of the agreement, not in a side agreement, in the text of the agreement that can be enforced, really matter. That'll have an enormous impact on the flow that we are seeing now. Changing our tax policy -- the very idea that we give tax breaks to American companies who are leaving and going overseas and taking jobs with them is absolutely crazy when we are losing millions of jobs.</p>
