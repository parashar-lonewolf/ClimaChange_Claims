        <p>When Bill Clinton became the first Democrat in a dozen years to move into the White House, the party's cognoscenti saw the treatment of Stuart E. Eizenstat as a sign of the young Administration's disdain for the political skills of the old crowd of former top aides to Jimmy Carter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Eizenstat, who had been President Carter's chief policy maker for his domestic agenda and then spent the Reagan and Bush years on the sidelines at a large law firm, was sent by President Clinton to Brussels, where he had the relatively obscure post of ambassador to the European Union.</p>

        <p>When Bill Clinton became the first Democrat in a dozen years to move into the White House, the party's cognoscenti saw the treatment of Stuart E. Eizenstat as a sign of the young Administration's disdain for the political skills of the old crowd of former top aides to Jimmy Carter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Eizenstat, who had been President Carter's chief policy maker for his domestic agenda and then spent the Reagan and Bush years on the sidelines at a large law firm, was sent by President Clinton to Brussels, where he had the relatively obscure post of ambassador to the European Union.</p>
        <p>Slowly, Mr. Eizenstat demonstrated to the President that he could be trusted to handle sensitive assignments, and after tackling many of the most difficult trade issues as a high-ranking official at both the State Department and Commerce Department, it was hardly surprising that Mr. Clinton would turn to him today to become the next Deputy Treasury Secretary, one of the most important economic policy jobs in Washington.</p>
        <p>Mr. Eizenstat was praised by aides and friends for having a mind for the mind-numbing minutiae of trade policy but who can also see the bigger picture. His assignments from Mr. Clinton have included negotiating with the Swiss Government and banks over reparations for Holocaust victims, dealing with the Europeans over threatened trade sanctions for foreign companies doing business with Cuba, leading the American delegation to the global warming conference in Kyoto, Japan, and resolving a difficult shipping dispute with Japan.</p>
        <p>''Stu has handled many of our nation's most difficult missions over the last six years, from our successful efforts to lift food and medicine sanctions on trading partners -- or nontrading partners -- to the struggle for justice in compensation on behalf of the victims of the Holocaust, an endeavor he will continue,'' President Clinton said today in a ceremony in the Rose Garden. ''With his legendary grasp of policy and the art of practical government, his long experience, his stamina and his steady judgment, he will be a vital, full member of our economic team.''</p>
        <p>Stuart Elliott Eizenstat was born in Chicago on Jan. 15, 1943. After graduating from the University of North Carolina and Harvard Law School, he landed a job as a junior aide to President Lyndon Johnson in 1967 and worked the next year as research director for the unsuccessful presidential campaign of Hubert H. Humphrey.</p>
        <p>Before joining the Carter Administration, he became a partner in the Washington office of Powell, Goldstein, Frazer &amp; Murphy, a large Atlanta law firm, and his clients included several large American and foreign companies with trade issues pending in Washington.</p>
        <p>Away from work, Mr. Eizenstat is known for dedication to religion and religious causes. A practicing Jew who leaves his office early enough on Fridays to observe the Sabbath, he once had President Carter to his home for a Passover seder. He also took his own china to Belgium and raised tens of thousands of dollars in private donations to refurbish the kitchen of the American Embassy in Brussels to make it kosher.</p>
        <p>One question that emerges from today's appointment will be how Mr. Eizenstat, who had his share of turf fights during both the Carter and Clinton Administrations, will get along with Lawrence H. Summers, who was nominated as the next Treasury Secretary. Explaining Mr. Eizenstat's success both in government and in private practice, Simon Lazarus 3d, a close friend and former law partner, said, ''He is relentless in trying to prevail.''</p>
        <p>''He is so determined that he finds it physically painful to lose,'' Mr. Lazarus said. Mr. Summers is known to be similarly strong-willed, leading some officials to wonder today how the two men would work together.</p>
