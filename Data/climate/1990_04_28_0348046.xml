        <p>LEAD: Perrier's natural spring came to life in New York City yesterday - but not exactly the way planned in the company's $25 million reintroduction campaign. One of four delivery trucks bearing the first shipment overheated on the way from the Bronx to Greenwich Village and its radiator spurted like a geyser, sending the 1979 GMC truck wheezing down Ninth Avenue.</p>
        <p>Perrier's natural spring came to life in New York City yesterday - but not exactly the way planned in the company's $25 million reintroduction campaign. One of four delivery trucks bearing the first shipment overheated on the way from the Bronx to Greenwich Village and its radiator spurted like a geyser, sending the 1979 GMC truck wheezing down Ninth Avenue.</p>
        <p>''It's got to be Perrier,'' said Luis Jerez, who had stopped to stare on his way to work.</p>
        <p>It didn't matter that the truck's side panels sported an advertisement for the Seven-Up Company, whose New York division distributes Perrier. It didn't matter that the Perrier's optimistic advertisements have jammed local radio and television, or that free samples of the water were being passed out at that moment throughout Manhattan. The mobile geyser was the only fitting conclusion for the 1990 Perrier tragifarce.</p>
        <p>Company That Couldn't Shoot Straight</p>
        <p>Since Perrier was recalled three months ago, the company that sells the pear-shaped green bottles has sometimes seemed like The Conglomerate That Couldn't Shoot Straight. When a trace of benzene was detected in a few of its bottles, Perrier aimed for a corporate response as pure as the image of its product. But forces of nature, society and government kept getting in the way.</p>
        <p>''Stand back,' yelled Jimmy Cahill, the driver, as he jumped from the cab and flung open the hood. ''No comment,'' he told a reporter as radiator water spewed. But his shoulders shook with supressed laughter and he muttered: ''Do you believe this? Today? I've had truck trouble maybe four times driving this route for 10 years. I do not believe this.'' Four or five onlookers believed it. Although the orginal contamination was not health-threatening, Source Perrier voluntarily recalled all of its water. But then the company misidentified the problem.</p>
        <p>''The source is not tainted,'' the company assured the public about the primordial spring that bubbles up in much of Perrier's advertising. A week later the company said that although the water contained no benzene, the natural carbon dioxide injected to give the water its sparkle does contain the contaminant and someone had neglected to clean the filters that usually remove it.</p>
        <p>Humans Are Imperfect</p>
        <p>''It was a human error,'' the company said. ''Unlike our spring in Verges, France, humans are imperfect.''</p>
        <p>But that admission showed that the spring didn't live up to its advertised image in America. Rather than being naturally carbonated, the bubbles were added by imperfect humans. And as shipments of the new Perrier began arriving in America, the Federal Food and Drug Administration questioned whether it merited a ''Naturally Sparkling'' label. Perrier agreed to change its label by July.</p>
        <p>Plans for the reintroduction continued. ''Save us a place,'' said one ad. ''Worth waiting for,'' said another.</p>
        <p>On and Off and On the Trucks</p>
        <p>A week ago Wednesday the company loaded the first cases in a Bronx warehouse, only to learn that New York State had not recertified the product. One sample tested too high in sodium to be legally labeled ''salt free.''</p>
        <p>The cases were loaded and unloaded daily for a week. At 10:30 Wednesday night (after a story in The Wall Street Journal about the elevated sodium content) the ''state said their test was faulty and gave us the go-ahead,'' said Kim Jeffery, senior vice president of The Perrier Group of America in Greenwich, Conn.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jeffery told his team of 60 reintroduction workers to proceed. They set up six ersatz sidewalk cafes and on Thursday began handing out 15,000 free bottles of water a day.</p>
        <p>The Water That Saved Perrier</p>
        <p>Some customers accepted them with looks that said: ''I didn't really miss you, but I'm glad you didn't really go away.''</p>
        <p>By 9 A.M. yesterday Mr. Jeffrey's troops were studying customer response and talking nervously into their cellular cafe phones. Mr. Cahill was calling a mechanic. Within 30 minutes his radiator had been replaced and he had refilled it with the water that, yesterday, saved Perrier - generic distilled, in half-gallon plastic jugs, from a corner greengrocer.</p>
