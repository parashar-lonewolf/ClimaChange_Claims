        <p>Bonnie Raitt probably does not agree with Kermit the Frog's contention that it's not easy being green. Indeed, for her, being green is not just simple, it's economical -- and proof once more of what she calls ''the timeless Quaker philosophy -- that you can do good at the same time you are doing well.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Raitt, a nine-time Grammy winner, is now well into a 38-city tour that originated in Birmingham, Ala., on July 26 and is scheduled to end in Los Angeles on Sept. 23. Powering the lights and sound systems in all those cities uses a lot of electricity. And the utility companies that generate those kilowatts generally wind up spitting out a lot of carbon dioxide, which has been associated with global warming.</p>

        <p>Bonnie Raitt probably does not agree with Kermit the Frog's contention that it's not easy being green.

        <p>Ms. Raitt, a nine-time Grammy winner, is now well into a 38-city tour that originated in Birmingham, Ala., on July 26 and is scheduled to end in Los Angeles on Sept. 23. Powering the lights and sound systems in all those cities uses a lot of electricity. And the utility companies that generate those kilowatts generally wind up spitting out a lot of carbon dioxide, which has been associated with global warming.</p>
        <p>So Ms. Raitt, an outspoken environmentalist, signed up the Green Mountain Energy Company as a co-sponsor of her tour. The gimmick: Green Mountain calculates how much ''dirty'' electricity she uses per show, and donates an equal amount of ''clean'' electricity to the local power grid. It pledges that its electricity is generated by wind power.</p>
