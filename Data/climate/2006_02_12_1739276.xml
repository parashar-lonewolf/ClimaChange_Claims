        <p>There are only five Danish athletes at the Winter Olympics, all of them curlers. No lugers, skiers, halfpipers or skaters, just five female curlers representing their country. That is not, in itself, remarkable; 35 other nations have sent five or fewer athletes here.</p>
        <p>But rather than be seen, as they prefer, as contenders for Denmark's second Winter Olympics medal (the first was a silver in 1998, also in women's curling), they are viewed as representatives of a nation under political siege, asked to comment on issues they have nothing to do with.</p>
        <p>Denmark has been the target of angry protests by Muslims who are outraged by cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad in Jyllands-Posten, the country's largest daily newspaper.</p>
        <p>Denmark's foreign ministry temporarily withdrew its ambassadors from Syria, Iran and Indonesia on Saturday because of safety concerns. Early this month, the building that houses the Danish embassy in Damascus, Syria, was set afire by protesters. And on Friday, the editor who decided to publish the cartoons went on an indefinite leave, citing the stress of the situation.</p>
        <p>Saturday at the Palaghiaccio, the 3,000-seat arena that is home to curling in the Turin Games, the Danish team practiced side by side with the women's teams from the United States, Norway and Sweden. The five Danish curlers seemed unperturbed by the controversy as they pushed 42-pound stones along one of four ice sheets toward concentric circles on the other end.</p>
        <p>They were advised by team officials not to discuss the matter with the news media, and only one, Dorthe Holm, spoke briefly to reporters under the condition that she not be asked about the political conflagration. Holm was part of the 1998 silver-medal team and came out of retirement to compete in Turin.</p>
        <p>''Our main priority is to make sure that they concentrate on the sport,'' Jesper Frigast Larsen, the team's chef de mission, said during the practice.</p>
        <p>''We want to make sure they enjoy being at the Olympics. It's such a huge thing that we don't want outside matters to distract them.''</p>
        <p>Niels Larsen, the president of the Danish Curling Association, who is not related to Jesper, said: ''It's not a problem for curling. It's a problem for Denmark. We have to live with it, and we will as long as we feel security is sufficient.''</p>
        <p>Security for the team has been increased, Danish officials said, but no uniformed officers were evident during its 80-minute practice.</p>
        <p>The protective stance taken by the Danish team stood in contrast to the light tone projected by the American women, who are growing accustomed to the attention paid to them by the news media, a consequence of the sport's sudden bump in popularity during the Salt Lake City Games in 2002.</p>
        <p>They animatedly discussed the quality of the ice, the different brooms (synthetic or horsehair) they use to vigorously sweep the ice to direct the stone and the silly questions they are asked. (''Do you sweep at home?'' is one of them.) They were preparing to surprise their teammate Jamie Johnson with a visit by her fianc√©, a trip financed by Bank of America, a sponsor.</p>
        <p>Jamie's sister, Cassie, is the leader, or skip, of the team, which won the silver medal in the world championships.</p>
        <p>A medal by American curlers, men or women, would certainly be one of many. If the Danes win, it will be enormous news, akin to the reaction to the silver medal in 1998, which propelled that team's skip, Helena Blach, to stardom in her country of 5.4 million, where curling was not well known.</p>
        <p>She became recognizable and used her fame to cajole the mayor of Hvidovre, a suburb of Copenhagen, to build a curling arena. Quickly, the number of curlers in Denmark doubled to 1,000. (Canada has the most, 1.2 million; the United States only 16,000.) Among those Blach converted to curling were Maria Poulsen and Denise Dupont, members of the 2006 team.</p>
        <p>''If they win, curling fever will recur,'' said Soren-Mikael Hansen, sports editor of the Danish newspaper Politiken. Curling grew popular enough, he said, for it to inspire songs and to be played at bachelor parties.</p>
        <p>Hansen said that being a celebrity in Denmark, which Blach was, and which Holm will probably become if her team wins a medal here, was not the outsized phenomenon it is elsewhere.</p>
        <p>''It's on a much quieter level, even if it's becoming slightly more and more American,'' he said. ''You still have a respect for privacy much more here than in the U.S. or England.''</p>
        <p>Still, a curler, however celebrated, is not as likely to be as well known to Danes as Lars Ulrich, Metallica's drummer, or the actor Ulrich Thomsen.</p>
        <p>And certainly not as famous as a Danish royal, one of whom, Princess Benedikte, was at the arena to visit the curlers, but not to speak to reporters.</p>
