        <p>A multimillion dollar experiment to show that toxic PCB's can be removed from the bottom of the Hudson River by using river bacteria is under way here, about 190 miles north of New York City.</p>
        <p>Scientists from the General Electric Company began the experiment on Aug. 9, a few miles south of the company's two manufacturing plants that caused the problem by dumping PCB's in the river from 1946 to 1976, when they were banned. The bacteria breakdown of PCB's, or polychlorinated biphenyls, is intended as an alternative to dredging.</p>
        <p>The scientists said the bacteria -- anaerobic organisms, which do not require oxygen, and aerobic organisms, which do -- have been naturally cleaning the river by destroying the PCB's and producing carbon dioxide, water and chlorides no more dangerous than salt water. To help speed the process, the General Electric scientists will feed the aerobic organisms in the river, as well as place more aerobic organisms there.</p>
        <p>"We have evidence that the river is improving," said Dr. Daniel A. Abramowicz, the manager of the company's environmental technology program in Schenectady. "We think it is because of the natural biodegradation of the PCB's by the bacteria in the river."  Ban on Striped Bass</p>
        <p>Dr. Abramowicz said that the anaerobic organisms break apart heavily chlorinated PCB's, while the aerobic organisms break apart lightly chlorinated PCB's.</p>
        <p>For 15 years, government officials have been wrestling with how to rid the river of PCB's, which were used in coolants and lubricants and have been classified as carcinogenic because of research showing that they cause tumors in rats. No direct tie to human health has been demonstrated.</p>
        <p>As a precautionary measure, the state has placed a ban in the Hudson on most commercial fishing of striped bass, which show relatively high levels of PCB's in their livers and fat, and has warned people not to eat fish caught there.</p>
        <p>In addition, state and Federal agencies are again studying proposals to clean up the river.</p>
        <p>The Federal Environmental Protection Agency, which decided in 1984 that the company had to remove PCB's from the land but not the water, is studying other possible solutions.</p>
        <p>The first phase of its study is due next month. If the Federal agency decides that the river must be cleaned by dredging, it could allocate the costs, estimated at $280 million, to General Electric.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the State Department of Environmental Conservation is preparing a new dredging plan to replace one rejected in 1989. John Dergosits, that agency's project manager, said it hoped to recommend by early 1992 a new site to contain the contaminated materials.</p>
        <p>In the past, the state's dredging proposals have been supported by environmental groups but opposed by local residents, who are against dumping toxic chemicals near where they live.</p>
        <p>"We still support removing most of the contaminated sediments from the river," said Cara Lee, environmental director of Scenic Hudson, a major environmental organization. "We are skeptical about the G.E. approach."</p>
        <p>General Electric, which has spent more than $25 million so far on PCB-related research, has said that based on early reports, dredging is not needed because the river is cleaning itself.</p>
        <p>Dr. Abramowicz said that because the upper Hudson River contains a large concentration of lightly chlorinated PCB's, the experiments at Fort Edward are concentrating on using aerobic microrganisms.</p>
        <p>The question now, Dr. Abramowicz said, is whether they will work better and faster in the river if they are given additional oxygen and other nutrients.</p>
        <p>To find out, General Electric scientists have installed six small caissons into PCB-contaminated sediments on the river bottom. Two of the caissons are controls, with nothing added. In the others, varying amounts of oxygen, phosphorus and nitrogen, as well as aerobic organisms, are added to see whether the destruction of PCB's can be hastened.</p>
