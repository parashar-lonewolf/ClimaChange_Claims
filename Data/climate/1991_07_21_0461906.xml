        <p>Air Pollution in Mexico City</p>
        <p>Q.</p>
        <p>I expect to be in Mexico City around Christmas. In spite of how bad the air pollution is there, are there precautions one can take? Are some sections worse than others? -- John Ponciano, Holland, Mich.</p>
        <p>A.  Mexico City's air is considered by many the most polluted in the world. You are likely to experience the effect of the pollution, as it is generally at its worst in December into March, when air inversions often keep bad air trapped over the city. This year there were thermal inversions every day in January, 27 days in February and 28 days in March. Pollution is usually at its worst at midday, but when there is an inversion, early morning is worst. Generally the southwestern part of the city, which includes Coyoacan and San Angel, popular with tourists, is highest in ozone. Carbon monoxide and lead are heaviest downtown with its concentration of traffic, and sulfur is heaviest in the industrial northern section.</p>
        <p>One way to keep up to date on air conditions is to look at The Mexico City News, an English-language daily paper, which publishes a daily air quality index. The index divides the city into five sectors, telling, for the previous day, levels of ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and carbon dioxide in each, on a scale of zero to 500, with 100 being the highest acceptable level for each substance. (Zero to 100 is satisfactory, 101 to 200 is unsatisfactory, 201 to 300 is dangerous and 301 to 500 is very dangerous.) Suspended particles -- namely, dust, fecal matter and other substances -- are not rated. Another information source is the English-language FM radio station, Radio VIP, 88.1 on the dial. At 7:15 each morning, a pollution expert discusses the outlook for the day.</p>
        <p>The most common reaction to the bad air is a runny nose, cough and irritated eyes; eye moistening drops and throat lozenges may provide some relief. Those who wear contact lenses should take glasses, as the lenses often become irritating. Beyond those problems, the chief risk is of respiratory system infections, such as bronchitis or sinusitis, according to Dr. Richard F. Thompson, director of the travel clinic of the Sunnyvale Medical Clinic, in Sunnyvale, Calif.  Dr. Thompson recommends that concerned travelers, especially those with a history of respiratory problems, check with a doctor before they go to Mexico City, and ask about medications to take along in case of problems. Travelers should drink plenty of fluids, which can help move irritating particles out of breathing tubes, he suggests. Dr. Daniel Libby, a pulmonary specialist at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in New York, also cites the risk for anyone with a history of asthma. He suggests considering a filtering mask.</p>
        <p>Here are some precautions that many Mexico City residents take when pollution is highest: Stay indoors when pollution is at its daily peak, and avoid walking around congested areas during rush hour. Avoid gas stations, whose fumes may aggravate eyes and lungs. Indoors, keep windows closed, and use air-conditioning. Do not exercise outdoors when pollution is at dangerous levels.  Working Farms With Guests</p>
        <p>Q. Are there working farms in driving distance of New York to which families can go? -- Barbara Feldman, Spring Valley, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A.  A working farm about 120 miles north of New York is Merrill's Farm, R.D. 1, Roscoe, New York 12776; (607) 498-4212. The owners raise beef cattle on their 450 acres farm, which borders the Catskill Forest Preserve. There are four rooms for guests, each with two beds. The cost is $40 a bed a night, including all meals.</p>
        <p>The greatest concentration of such places in driving distance of New York is near Lancaster, Pa., about three and a half hours away.</p>
        <p>One is Cedar Hill Farm, 305 Longenecker Road, Mount Joy, Pa. 17552; (717) 653-4655. The farm raises chickens and grows corn and soybeans. Guests stay in an 1817 farmhouse at $55 for two in a room with private bath, including breakfast.</p>
        <p>Jonde Lane Farm, 1103 Auction Road, Manheim, Pa. 17545, (717) 665-4231, eight miles northwest of Lancaster, has four guest rooms in a 1859 house. The 100-acre farm has 30 cows and 70,000 broiler chickens, plus kittens, puppies, a pet lamb and a pony. The rate is $40 for two adults plus $5 a child, including breakfast. All rooms have shared bath.</p>
        <p>Country Pines Farm and Cottage, 1101 Auction Road, Manheim, Pa. 17545, (717) 665-5478, is a dairy farm with guest rooms in a cottage converted from a smokehouse and in the main house, which was built in the early 19th century. Rates are $40 for two people; $5 per child and $10 for each additional adult in a room. Breakfast is $2.50; free for children. Hut-to-Hut Colorado Hiking</p>
        <p>Q.</p>
        <p>I am interested in hut-to-hut backpacking in the Colorado Rockies. Can you provide information? -- Michael Solomon, Millburn, N.J.</p>
        <p>A.  Eleven huts along the 10th Mountain Trail in Colorado, used previously only in winter for cross-country skiers, have been opened this summer for hikers. The huts are in the central Colorado Rockies in an area roughly bounded by Aspen on the southwest, Leadville on the southeast, Vail Pass on the east and Vail on the north. The huts are at altitudes ranging from 10,300 to 11,700 feet.  Each sleeps 16 and is furnished with mattresses and pillows on sleeping platforms, propane cooking stoves, wood stoves for heating and kitchen utensils. Hiking along the trail is of intermediate difficulty, the trail association says, and off-trail hiking is intermediate to difficult.</p>
        <p>The huts are designated for hikers, mountain bikers and horseback riders; a four-wheel drive vehicle may be allowed, but only if necessary to take supplies. (The huts are near the Holy Cross and Hunter Frying Pan wilderness areas, which do not allow mountain bikes.) The fee is $20 a person a night, and reservations are vital, available from the 10th Mountain Trail Association, 1280 Ute Avenue, Aspen, Colo. 81611; (303) 925-5775. The association also books space in three private lodges along the trail, at $20 to $27 a person a night. Radio City Christmas Show</p>
        <p>Q.</p>
        <p>What will be the dates of the Radio City Christmas show in 1991? How does one get advance tickets? -- Sallie Pryor, Winston-Salem, N.C.</p>
        <p>A.  The upcoming Christmas Spectacular at Radio City Music Hall will take place Nov. 15 this year to Jan. 7, 1992. Tickets, which will go on sale Aug. 28, will be $22 to $37, depending on date and seat location. Tickets are sold at the Radio City box office, at 50th Street and Avenue of the Americas. in New York, or from Ticketmaster outlets anywhere in the country.</p>
