        <p>The death of a 12-year-old boy who was experimenting with gunpowder has been ruled accidental, the authorities said yesterday. The boy, Justin Szuba, was playing alone on Saturday when he decided to pack gunpowder into a carbon dioxide cartridge that he had found in his family's garage. The cartridge exploded when he lit it, driving shrapnel into his heart. SUSAN JO KELLER</p>
