        <p>How achingly alive they are, these people who insist that they have never really lived. The marvel of Ian Rickson's rapturous interpretation of Anton Chekhov's ''Seagull,'' which opened last week at the Royal Court Theater and quickly became a must-have and largely unhaveable ticket, is how seamlessly it captures the vital paradox that so often escapes productions of this masterwork: the bursting theatrical fullness to be found in its unfulfilled lives.</p>
        <p>Using an agile new adaptation by Christopher Hampton, ''The Seagull'' is Mr. Rickson's swan song as the artistic director of the Royal Court. Critics were prepared to carp at the selection of a century-old classic as a valedictory offering from the head of a theater devoted principally to new work. But such objections have been stifled by the production's in-the-moment immediacy.</p>
        <p>In a season plump with notable revivals of landmark plays, including Ibsen's ''Ghosts'' and Beckett's ''Happy Days'' (with the brilliant Fiona Shaw), this ''Seagull'' flies higher than any of them through unconditional trust in its author's original voice. What makes this version, which features Kristin Scott Thomas in expert form as an actress in flight from advancing age, so startlingly fresh is how intently those involved seem to have listened to Chekhov, rather than talking over him. This show moves to the ineffably true-to-life rhythms that you sense when you read Chekhov's plays but seldom hear when they are translated to the stage.</p>
        <p>Over the years I have seen Chekhov updated, postmodernized and deconstructed into splinters. Some of these productions included glittering individual performances, by stars like Ian McKellen, Simon Russell Beale and Meryl Streep. But I have never seen an entire cast walk so gracefully through the slippery ground of contradictions that is Chekhov -- between comedy and tragedy, the everyday and the eternal, the hopelessness of human solitude and of being oppressively linked to others.</p>
        <p>This heightened double edge is honed by an illusion of absolute simplicity. Hildegard Bechtler's evocation of a Russian country estate in the late 19th century is as minimal as it can be while remaining true to place and period. The space is defined by how the characters inhabit it: the family of the invalid councilman Sorin (Peter Wight) and his sister, Arkadina (Ms. Scott Thomas), and their friends and servants, a group efficiently summed up by the philosophizing doctor Dorn (the excellent Art Malik), who observes irritably, ''Everyone's so neurotic, so neurotic.''</p>
        <p>Yet the neuroses and eccentricities are mercifully (and uncommonly) underplayed, in ways that subtly encourage you to see these familiar souls with virgin eyes. As Konstantin, Arkadina's terminally conflicted and rebellious son, the hollow-eyed Mackenzie Crook substitutes a slow-burning intensity for the expected Oedipal pyrotechnics, an intellectual detachment that never anesthetizes or quite conceals an abiding pain.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wight's Sorin, instead of being the traditional petulant curmudgeon, brims with a childlike hunger for the worldly pleasures he has never known. Chiwetel Ejiofor's Trigorin, the famous writer, is less the standard aesthete-poseur than a man of natural instincts trapped in an artificial life he both despises and needs. And Katherine Parkinson's magnificent Masha becomes a brooding alcoholic, given to clumsy, unedited outbursts of truth and temper.</p>
        <p>The two professional actresses among the characters in ''The Seagull'' -- the imperious Arkadina and the young Nina (Carey Mulligan) -- are revealed to be sisters of sorts under their different skins. Ms. Scott Thomas never lets us forget the calculating, defensive intelligence behind the ravenous vanity and angular theatrical gestures that summon the age of Duse and Bernhardt.</p>
        <p>Similarly Ms. Mulligan's Nina locates a core of hard ambition beneath the surface fragility and dewiness. Even in her climactic breakdown scene you sense a steeliness that will allow this Nina to endure, as she says she will. (''Ah, Chekhov knew his actresses, didn't he?'' said my date for ''The Seagull,'' a writer with long experience of actresses.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Rickson's staging makes it clear that conversation among these self-involved people rarely involves real connection. When the characters slip into soliloquy, stepping into melting pools of light (the work of Peter Mumford), it for once seems totally unforced. Mr. Rickson daringly lets silences linger, and they are among the production's most resonant moments, replete with buzzing egos and futile desires.</p>
        <p>If ''The Seagull'' judiciously takes its time in letting personalities develop organically, the Gate Theater production of Ibsen's ''Ghosts'' sends its characters sprinting in a relentless dash for the finish line. The Gate, a tiny theater in the Notting Hill district, has acquired a reputation for reinvigorating difficult classics, including O'Neill's ''Emperor Jones'' and Büchner's ''Woyzeck.''</p>
        <p>The company's approach to ''Ghosts,'' the 1881 drama of sexual hypocrisy that famously shocked and disgusted its early audiences and critics, has been to condense it into a kind of thematic boullion cube. As adapted by Amelia Bullmore and directed by Anna Mackmin, this production takes place in under 90 intermissionless minutes, set in a revolving claustrophobic wooden box, designed by Lez Brotherston.</p>
        <p>The show doesn't miss a single plot point or expository speech. But it's like watching a plant grow in time-lapse photography. The ghosts of the title, the outmoded conventions and pieties that suffocate life, are allowed no natural space to unfold and haunt. This is a shame, since there's a promising poetry in Niamh Cusack's take on the guilt-crippled Mrs. Alving, played in a beguiling spirit of thwarted girlishness, and Finbar Lynch's repressed Pastor Manders.</p>
        <p>By contrast Deborah Warner's production of Samuel Beckett's ''Happy Days'' stretches out of its source's traditional tightness. This great comedy of existential bleakness from 1960, in which a woman named Winnie (Ms. Shaw) tries to find the bright side of life while buried in a hill of dirt, has been scaled up to match the dimensions of the capacious Lyttelton space at the National Theater.</p>
        <p>Winnie's imprisoning mound of earth is now part of a vast blasted landscape (designed by Tom Pye) that might have been created by nuclear explosion. Jean Kalman's lighting has a solar cruelty that suggests that the ozone layer is a thing of the past. And Ms. Shaw's Winnie is larger of gesture and broader of intonation, both comic and despairing, than any I have seen.</p>
        <p>But unlike many symphonic productions of chamber plays, this ''Happy Days'' doesn't shrink in impact in growing bigger physically. Anyone who has seen Ms. Warner's earlier collaborations with Ms. Shaw, including first-rate interpretations of T. S. Eliot's ''Waste Land'' and Euripides' ''Medea,'' is aware of their emotional fierceness, integrity and specificity.</p>
        <p>Ms. Shaw, accordingly, refuses to play Winnie as only a metaphor, instead turning in an outsize but naturalistic performance, adorned with contemporary flourishes. Several London critics objected to this transformation of a cosmic heroine into the sort of middle-class housewife you might bump into in the grocery store.</p>
        <p>Yet the poignant essence of Winnie -- of her chipper, make-do stoicism in the face of decrepitude and death -- remains intact. Ms. Shaw brings a harrowing physiological dimension to the part, as if the rising dirt is gradually cutting off her air supply, which makes her fluttery social affectations seem all the more valiant.</p>
        <p>The warmth and implicit topicality of this ''Happy Days'' may well make it accessible to a new generation of theatergoers. Ms. Warner's ''Happy Days'' is unmistakably a product of its time. Productions like Mr. Rickson's ''Seagull,'' which seem to belong to no time and all time, are such rarities that it hardly seems fair to measure others against them.</p>
