        <p>SCIENTISTS in Canada have traced pollutants that contribute to the Arctic equivalent of smog to industrial sources in Western Europe.</p>
        <p>The pollution, known as Arctic haze, covers much of the area. Since the blue-gray haze was noticed in the 1950's, it has steadily worsened, and at times during the winter and spring it rivals pollution levels in large cities.</p>
        <p>The study, which appears in the current issue of the journal Nature, supports a widely held belief that industrial pollutants in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly from Europe and Asia, are funneled by weather patterns into the Arctic. Previous studies have traced particles in the haze to industrial areas in the Soviet Union; 75 percent of the land above the Arctic Circle is in the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>In the latest study, researchers at the National Water Research Institute and the Atmospheric Environment Service in Canada found that the composition of sulfur particles, a primary pollutant in the haze, matches those in Scandinavia, not those in southern Canada.</p>
        <p>The isotopes of sulfur, a byproduct of smelting or the burning of fossil fuels, vary according to the source, giving researchers a signature to trace, said Dr. Jerome O. Nriagu, the principal author of the report.</p>
        <p>"The signature of the isotopes convinces us that it has to be from Europe and not North America," Dr. Nriagu said.</p>
        <p>"People think of the Arctic as being clean and unspoiled," he said. "It is not really pristine anymore. It has become highly contaminated."</p>
