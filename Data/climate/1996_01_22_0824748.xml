        <p>By this afternoon, Jerome and Greg Carr were back at home, watching firefighters pump water from their basement and trying to start two waterlogged  cars parked in the yard.</p>
        <p>While the first-floor apartment that the family rents was not damaged by flooding, water filled the basement, where many of their belongings were stored. But things looked better in the daylight of today than they had as Saturday dawned.</p>
        <p>By 5:45 A.M. Saturday, Jerome Carr had decided it was time to leave. "The electric meter in the basement was under water and making a loud buzzing noise,  and the water was up to the rafters," he said. "It was time to get the wife and  kids and get out."</p>
        <p>A municipal sanitation truck was parked in front of his house waiting to help residents flee the rising waters of the nearby Millstone River. But the difficult part for Mr. Carr, a father of three who is legally blind, would be getting his family across the icy river of water that stood more than three feet deep between his front porch and the roadway where the sanitation truck was parked.</p>
        <p>With his son, Greg, 17, at his side, Mr. Carr waded into the yard, using a mop handle to chop his way through the ice. "Sheets of ice were floating all around us," he recalled today, standing in his front yard, with much of the water having receded back to the river. "I can't believe how cold the water was."</p>
        <p>Mr. Carr's daughter Jenee, 8, was the first one he attempted to carry to the  truck. "She was terrified," he said. "At the halfway point she was trying to get off my back and yelling, 'Daddy, I don't want to go.' I thought I'd lose her, but my son came over and grabbed her and took her to the truck." They repeated the trip several times, carrying out Mr. Carr's 4-year-old daughter, and then his wife.</p>
        <p>"I lost a lot of stuff," Mr. Carr said. "But I tell you, I'm really proud of  my son."</p>
        <p>A group of friends gathered around the open hood of one of their cars today,  tinkering and staring at the lifeless engine. Mr. Carr's landlord, Ruthann Ingram, arrived, and navigated her way across the ice-covered lawn to peer into  the cellar. Muddy water covered up to the top stair. "We've owned this house for 15 years, and we've never seen anything like this," Mrs. Ingram said. "We've never made a claim on the flood insurance, but I guess we will now."</p>
