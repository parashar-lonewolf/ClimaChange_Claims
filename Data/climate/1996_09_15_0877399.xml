        <p>CHOOSING home insulation is not a complicated task once you are aware of the materials available and have some understanding of how they are put together. Insulating materials can be grouped into three categories: materials made from living or natural resources, materials made from mineral resources and materials made from chemical synthesis.</p>
        <p>Materials made from living resources include cellulose (made from recycled paper), wood-wool and cotton fiber (a recent addition to the list of insulation materials). These organic materials are less expensive than the mineral or chemical products, but they are more susceptible to damage from moisture and insect or rodent infestation. In addition these materials are flammable and they should not be used unless they are treated with a fire-retardant chemical, like boric acid or aluminum sulfite powder.</p>

        <p>CHOOSING home insulation is not a complicated task once you are aware of the materials available and have some understanding of how they are put together. Insulating materials can be grouped into three categories: materials made from living or natural resources, materials made from mineral resources and materials made from chemical synthesis.</p>
        <p>Materials made from living resources include cellulose (made from recycled paper), wood-wool and cotton fiber (a recent addition to the list of insulation materials). These organic materials are less expensive than the mineral or chemical products, but they are more susceptible to damage from moisture and insect or rodent infestation. In addition these materials are flammable and they should not be used unless they are treated with a fire-retardant chemical, like boric acid or aluminum sulfite powder.</p>
        <p>Mineral wool (often known by the trade name Rock-wool), expanded mica (vermiculite or perlite) and glass fiber (a common trade name is Fiberglas) are common mineral products. These materials are a little more expensive than the organics, but they are relatively non-flammable.</p>
        <p>Polystyrene (also called Styrofoam), polyurethane (also called urethane), urea formaldehyde, urea-tripolymer and isocyanurate are all products of chemical synthesis that have excellent insulation properties. Unfortunately these products have some serious drawbacks. Polystyrene, polyurethane, urea formaldehyde and isocyanurate are all flammable. They give off toxic fumes when burning (for this reason urea formaldehyde has been banned by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission and urethane is banned by some local building codes).</p>
        <p>Urea-tripolymer has a low fire-hazard rating, but some environmentalists are concerned that it could release formaldehyde gas into the house over time. They also point out that all these plastic materials might damage the earth's ozone layer by releasing chlorofluorocarbons into the atmosphere. Manufacturers point out that at present there has not been enough research to substantiate these claims.</p>
        <p>Not all chemical synthetics have these problems. A relatively new foam, trade name Air-Krete, is an environmentally safe product that will not burn. It can be injected into closed wall cavities, but this is not a job for the do-it-yourselfer since it has to be carefully formulated on the job site.</p>
        <p>Chemical synthetics have a slightly higher R-value (the ability of the material to resist heat flow) than either the natural or mineral products. But in addition to the material, the structure and form are also important. Insulation material is designed to trap air in a network of minute, closed pockets. The trapped air is really the insulator, because it blocks heat losses that normally occur from convection.</p>
        <p>Insulation designers use two different methods to trap air: with a cluster of fibers in the form of loose-fill or batt insulation, or with tiny bubbles in the form of rigid or injected foam.</p>
        <p>Glass fiber, mineral wool and cotton fiber can be spun into blankets or bats. Blankets are rolls of fiber, 16 or 24 inches wide and up to 64 feet long. Thicknesses are usually 3, 6 and 9 inches; although thinner, 1-inch rolls are available for sill insulation and pipe wrap. Bats are simply blankets cut into manageable lengths of 4 or 8 feet.</p>
        <p>Some people experience allergic reactions to glass fiber. It's best then to don a respirator, goggles, gloves and wear long sleeves when working with it.</p>
        <p>Mineral wool, expanded mica, glass fiber, cellulose, wood-wool and cotton fibers are used for loose fill particles. These particles are not compressed or spun into any fixed shape. Instead the loose material, available in large bags, is poured into spaces between joists or pumped into wall cavities. Loose fill tends to settle with time, and become more compact. More loose fill must then be added to compensate for the loss in insulation value. Do-it-yourselfers can easily pour loose fill into the gaps between joists. Pumping it into wall cavities requires more skill, because the air pressure and blower speed of the pump can affect how the material settles in place.</p>
        <p>Polystyrene, urethane and glass fiber can be compressed or molded into rigid boards. They are available in 8-foot lengths, and widths of 16, 24 and 48 inches. Polystyrene and urethane have excellent insulation properties, but they are flammable and should be covered with gypsum wall board. These plastic boards are not waterproof and excessive moisture can penetrate and cause them to lose up to half their R-value. An extruded form of polystyrene, commonly called ''blueboard'' for its color, and glass fiber boards are impermeable to moisture.</p>
        <p>Foam in the form of urea formaldehyde, urethane and Air-Krete can be pumped from tanks into the wall cavities. As the foam cures it shrinks and loses some of its insulating effectiveness. This shrinkage will be minimal (less than 5 percent) if the foam is formulated correctly and injected when the ambient temperature is moderate (ideally between 50 and 80 degrees). Obviously this is a job for a professional contractor.</p>
        <p>Insulation can help to cut heat losses in a house, but it can also create additional problems when it traps the moisture-laden air. When this air hits the cold sheathing on the other side of the insulation, the moisture condenses and collects in the framing cavities. This can result in ruined insulation and wood rot. An effective way to prevent this is by installing a vapor barrier. Some forms of insulation, like blankets, bats and rigid panels are available with vapor barriers.</p>
