        <p>LEAD: LAST Christmas, merchants in Gregory, S.D., subsidized low-interest loans for shoppers at local lending institutions, provided the money was spent with Gregory merchants. To make sure that it was, the lenders issued ''Gregory Bucks,'' redeemable only with participating merchants in the town of 1,500.</p>
        <p>LAST Christmas, merchants in Gregory, S.D., subsidized low-interest loans for shoppers at local lending institutions, provided the money was spent with Gregory merchants. To make sure that it was, the lenders issued ''Gregory Bucks,'' redeemable only with participating merchants in the town of 1,500.</p>
        <p>''It's been very successful,'' said Joseph Duling, vice president of the First Fidelity Bank's branch in Gregory. ''It increased sales and brought new business here.''</p>
        <p>The Gregory experiment fits into the broad area known as import substitution: replacing imported goods and services with local or regional ones. The idea, essentially, is to cross-pollinate the local economy and keep local dollars at home.</p>
        <p>In northern Minnesota's depressed Iron Range, development specialists are trying to match regional needs with local services and products. The Arrowhead Regional Development Commission, which covers a seven-county region around Duluth, set up a non-profit affiliate, the Northspan Group Inc., to be a matchmaker between local suppliers and producers that had been shopping elsewhere. The group has already made three matches that will provide dozens of jobs.</p>
        <p>In one instance, R.E.H. Engineering Inc., a company in Cohasset, Minn., had been buying equipment from suppliers in Chicago and Detroit. Arrowhead put the company in touch with Kramer &amp; Moen Machine Company Inc. in Duluth, which agreed to supply the same equipment for $90,000 instead of $130,000.</p>
        <p>''Our field brokers contact businesses that are making purchases,'' said David Martin, Arrowhead's executive director. ''Then they find someone locally who currently produces the needed product or who might be able to produce it.''</p>
        <p>Energy conservation is a way to avoid imports of fossil fuels (whether from Texas or Saudi Arabia is beside the point) - providing more dollars that can be spent at home. Many towns have embarked on conservation programs to prevent local funds from flowing outward.</p>
        <p>Even food has become a major import in rural areas. To counter that trend, many states, including Texas and Massachusetts, have set up programs that promote local agriculture. Some fast-food chains, like Arby's, are buying from local farmers. In Freeport, Me., the State O' Maine Bar &amp; Grill &amp; Bar uses local produce for its salad bar along with indigenous lobster and fish. Said Margaret Lee, a marketer for the company, ''It costs more but it's fresher.''  WHAT'S NEW IN REVIVING RURAL AMERICA</p>
