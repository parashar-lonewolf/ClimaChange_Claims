        <p>''Penguins of the Antarctic,'' on PBS tomorrow, appears to have been made by a very mellow person, of vast patience, with the slowed heartbeat almost of a mammal in hibernation. This is not to say it's boring, though it is. But it's also slow in that morally instructive way, the way that's a painstaking reproof to our bad, speedy, planet-polluting selves: slow as in slow food and slow down and in-Europe-they-have-siestas.</p>
        <p>Canon is one of the major sponsors of this Xanaxed production, which if it's pushing anything -- aside from the miracle of penguin life, which will come as news to no one who saw last year's glorious megahit ''March of the Penguins'' -- it's pushing panoramic photography.

        <p>''Penguins of the Antarctic,'' on PBS tomorrow, appears to have been made by a very mellow person, of vast patience, with the slowed heartbeat almost of a mammal in hibernation. This is not to say it's boring, though it is. But it's also slow in that morally instructive way, the way that's a painstaking reproof to our bad, speedy, planet-polluting selves: slow as in slow food and slow down and in-Europe-they-have-siestas.</p>
        <p>Canon is one of the major sponsors of this Xanaxed production, which if it's pushing anything -- aside from the miracle of penguin life, which will come as news to no one who saw last year's glorious megahit ''March of the Penguins'' -- it's pushing panoramic photography. Beautiful pictures are now in reach of everyone, apparently, with the nifty Canon color-amplifying cameras and their chemical-free digital development process, which is a snap on the average laptop.</p>
        <p>Come to think of it, in our digital age spectacular nature photography is much, much easier and quicker than it used to be. Which is not to say that easy and quick are worthy goals. Not at all. Slow, slow, slow.</p>
        <p>Penguins certainly have to take it slow. All the 60-mile walks and monthslong separations between mates, and the sheltering of eggs while food is procured -- there's so much time-biding in penguinland that the birds would be well served by some hobbies apart from reproduction. I do like the way the males, stuck in freezing temperatures with the new eggs while the females go diving for food, huddle together, taking turns on the periphery of the crowd. The arrangement -- how they each recognize that some guys have to be temporarily cold for the general warmth of the group -- seems very fair and collectivist.</p>
        <p>Absent from ''Penguins of the Antarctic'' is the mean old alpha-male system -- that handy and horrible model for American corporate culture -- that is commonly on display in nature programming these days. Once again, this film is clearly meant as a corrective to all that jockeying and jerkiness: it's nice, on some level, that PBS is still issuing warnings to market capitalists to cool it.</p>
        <p>But when the subject turns to global warming -- as we know it must -- and the scrambling of penguins to adapt to melting icecaps, it takes a certain kind of orgiastic self-loathing (''We shortsighted humans!'') or at least self-exemption (''But I drive a Prius!'') to appreciate the show.</p>
        <p>On this point, maybe we should look to the heroic birds of the ice for exoneration. Surely penguins would also have driven high-emission cars and burned fossil fuels on their 60-mile treks if they'd been smart enough to dream them up; would they have happily given up their toasty Subarus, and gone back to the tedious tottering over ice? No.</p>
        <p>Every creature adapts to do things more efficiently, and sometimes wrecks the lives of other creatures in the process. Figuring out how to minimize the damage -- if for no other reason than to have penguins around to photograph with Canon cameras -- is just yet another stage in our evolution. And, if it's going to happen, we won't be bullied into it, even by didactic and beautiful films like this one, a feel-bad movie passing as low-key entertainment.</p>
