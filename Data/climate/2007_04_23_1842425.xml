        <p>Saying America must be weaned from its reliance on foreign oil, Senator John McCain of Arizona is renewing his call for a cap on emissions of greenhouse gases as a way to fight global warming.</p>
        <p>In the text of a speech he is scheduled to deliver today in Washington, Mr. McCain said: ''The problem isn't a Hollywood invention nor is doing something about it a vanity of Cassandra-like hysterics. It is a serious and urgent economic, environmental and national security challenge.''</p>
        <p>Members of his campaign staff released excerpts of the speech yesterday, the last of three major addresses by Mr. McCain before the formal start later this week of his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. The first speech focused on why he continued to support sending more troops to Iraq, and the second involved his economic proposals.</p>
        <p>''The world is already feeling the powerful effects of global warming,'' the text of the speech set for today said, ''and far more dire consequences are predicted if we let the growing deluge of greenhouse gas emissions continue, and wreak havoc with God's creation.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain describes energy independence as a pressing national security issue. He warns that selling oil props up Iran, which he describes as ''the No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism.'' He says President Hugo Ch√°vez of Venezuela is ''using his country's oil revenues to establish a dictatorship, bully his neighbors and succeed Castro as Latin America's leading antagonist of the United States.''</p>
        <p>In one excerpt from the speech, he said, ''National security depends on energy security, which we cannot achieve if we remain dependent on imported oil from Middle Eastern governments who support, or foment by their own inattention and inequities, the rise of terrorists, or on swaggering demagogues and would-be dictators in our hemisphere.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain, who has introduced legislation to lower carbon emissions, said that as president he would set ''reasonable caps'' on carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions, and would allow companies that reduced their emissions to earn credits that they could trade for a profit.</p>
        <p>''As it always does,'' Mr. McCain said, ''the profit motive will attract the transformational power of venture capital, and unleash the market to move clean alternative fuels and advanced energy technologies from the margins into the mainstream.''</p>
