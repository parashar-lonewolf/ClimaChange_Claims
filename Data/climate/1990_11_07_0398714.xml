        <p>ALASKA</p>
        <p>In the three-way race for the Governor's mansion, candidates squared off on what restrictions should be placed on development of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the best way to deal with the impact of a projected decline in oil revenues.</p>
        <p>All three candidates have lengthy political records. The Republican candidate, Arliss Sturgulewski, spent 12 years in the State Senate and ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1986. Wally Hickel, who served as Alaska's Governor from 1966 to 1968, differentiated himself from Mrs. Sturgulewski on abortion, which he opposes.</p>
        <p>The Democratic candidate, Tony Knowles, 47, made his first bid for governor by emphasizing his role as Mayor of Anchorage. Gov. Steve Cowper did not seek re-election.</p>
        <p>Personality upstaged policy in the race for Alaska's sole seat in the House of Representatives. The Republican candidate, Don Young squared off against a former Mayor of Valdez, John S. Devens. ARIZONA</p>
        <p>Notable among the state's Congressional races was the Second District's. The Democratic incumbent, Morris K. Udall, head of the House Interior Committee, defeated Joseph D. Sweeney, a law school administrator. Mr. Udall, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, said in May that he planned to retire in 1993.</p>
        <p>J. Fife Symington, a Republican and a developer, and Terry Goddard, a Democrat and former Mayor of Phoenix, ran a hotly fought race for Governor.</p>
        <p>In winning the Republican nomination, Mr. Symington beat out Evan Mecham, who was impeached and removed as Governor in 1988.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goddard, the son of a former Governor, resigned as Mayor to run for the post, after serving as the head of the National League of Cities.  COLORADO</p>
        <p>In the most hotly contested race in Colorado, Republican Representative Hank Brown won the Senate seat left open by the retirement of William L. Armstrong. Mr. Brown, who raised a large campaign treasury, defeated Josie Heath, a former Boulder County Commissioner who expended nearly all her campaign funds to win a rough primary race.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown's run at the Senate left open his Fourth District seat. The Republican candidate there was State Senator Wayne Allard, a veterinarian who managed Mr. Brown's re-election campaigns in 1984 and 1986. His opponent, State Representative Dick Bond, is a professional biologist and former president of the University of Northern Colorado.</p>
        <p>The Governor, Roy Romer, is a popular Democrat who never faced any serious competition. He easily defeated the Republican candidate, John Andrews.  CALIFORNIA</p>
        <p>Two former Mayors, Dianne Feinstein and Pete Wilson, fought a tough race for governor.  Ms. Feinstein is a Democrat and a former Mayor of San Francisco; Mr.  Wilson is a Republican, a former mayor of San Diego and currently a United States Senator.</p>
        <p>Gov. George Deukmejian, a Republican, did not run for re-election.</p>
        <p>In three major Congressional races, incumbents faced strong challenges: Charles Pashayan, a Republican, from the Democratic candi date, Calvin Dooley; George E. Brown Jr., a Democrat, from the Republican candidate, Bob Hammock, and Alfred A. McCandless, a Republican, from the Democratic candidate, Ralph Waite.</p>
        <p>There were 28 ballot issues. "Big Green," as one environmental proposition was called, was defeated, as was another proposition to limit terms of state officials.  HAWAII</p>
        <p>Senator Daniel K. Akaka, a Democrat appointed to the seat after the death in April of Spark M. Matsunaga, defeated Representative Patricia Saiki, a Republican in her second term in the House. Republicans had seen this state as perhaps their best chance to pick up a seat in the Senate, as they hoped Ms. Saiki could make inroads into the customary support Democrats enjoy among Hawaiians of Japanese descent.</p>
        <p>State Senator Neil Abercrombie, a Democrat, beat Mike Liu, leader of the Republicans in the State House, for one Congressional seat. Former Representative Patsy Mink, a Democrat who was appointed to Mr. Akaka's seat when he was named to the Senate, defeated former State Representative Andy Poepoe for the other seat. Gov. John Waihee, a Democrat, won re-election.  IDAHO</p>
        <p>The incumbent Governor, Cecil D. Andrus, a 59-year-old Democrat, defeated Roger Fairchild, a Republican and former majority leader of the State Senate.</p>
        <p>He served as Governor from 1971 to 1977 and as President Jimmy Carter's Interior Secretary from 1977 to 1981 before becoming Governor again.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the year he vetoed what would have been a highly restrictive state abortion law. For his part, Mr. Fairchild was a declared foe of abortion before winning the Republican gubernatorial nomination.</p>
        <p>With incumbent Republican Senator James A. McClure, 65, retiring, the race for his seat was between Representative Larry E. Craig, a Republican, and Ron Twilegar, a Democrat and former state legislator. The victor was Mr. Craig.</p>
        <p>Competing for Mr. Craig's Congressional seat were Larry LaRocco, a Democrat and stockbroker, and State Senator C. A. Smyser, a Republican.  MONTANA</p>
        <p>Senator Max Baucus, a Democrat, won a third term after shunning the complacency of his former colleague, Senator John Melcher. Mr. Melcher, a Democrat, ignored his campaign until the summer of 1988 and was defeated by Conrad Burns, a little known Republican.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baucus spent more than a year barnstorming the state and raised more than $2 million in his campaign against Lieut. Gov. Allen C. Kolstad, his Republican opponent. Mr. Kolstad evoked criticism last July by calling threats of acid rain and global warming "scare tactics."</p>
        <p>Representative Pat Williams, a six-term Democrat who was co-author of a compromise measure that continued Federal funding for the National Endowment for the Arts while leaving decisions on obscenity to the courts, was re-elected in the First District race by Brad Johnson, a former state party official. Mr. Johnson accused Mr. Williams of supporting pornography.  NEVADA</p>
        <p>Bob Miller, the Democrat who stepped into the Governor's office two years ago when the incumbent, Richard H. Bryan, was elected to the Senate, sought his own gubernatorial victory to run one of the country's fastest-growing states. He got it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller, the 45-year-old former two-term District Attorney from Las Vegas, stressed improving education and diversifying the state's economy.</p>
        <p>He won easily over Jim Gallaway, a 50-year-old lawyer and former Marine who achieved considerable financial success with his own telecommunications companies.</p>
        <p>In the Second District, four-term Representative Barbara F. Vucanovich, a Republican, defeated Jane Wisdom, a State Assemblywoman. NEW MEXICO</p>
        <p>With the incumbent Governor, Garrey Carruthers, ineligible to try for re-election, former Gov. Bruce King was the Democratic candidate for the post.</p>
        <p>In an energetic race, he beat former State Representative Frank Bond, the Republican candidate.</p>
        <p>The 66-year-old Mr. King, a rancher and businessman, was Governor from 1971 to 974 and again from 1979 to 1982. In this year's campaign, he stressed education, the environment and economic development. To spur economic development, he called for steps to create more growth in the state's private business sector.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bond, a 47-year-old lawyer and rancher with land interests, also stressed economic policies, calling for various measures to promote diversfied development and create additonal jobs in the state.</p>
        <p>Senator Pete V. Domenici, a third-term Republican, crushed his challenger, Democratic State Senator Tom R. Benavides.  OREGON</p>
        <p>After four terms in the Senate, Mark O. Hatfield, the Republican once best known as a dove on defense issues, defeated Harry Lonsdale, a wealthy Democratic businessman with environmental credentials. But Mr. Lonsdale's appeal forced Mr. Hatfield into an aggressive and uncharacteristically negative campaign.</p>
        <p>In the race for governor, Attorney General David Frohnmayer, a Republican, went into the campaign a favorite to succeed Gov. Neil Goldschmidt, a Democrat who is retiring. But by the end of the campaign, Secretary of State Barbara Roberts, a Democrat, came on strong.</p>
        <p>Support for Mr. Frohnmayer was partly eroded by a third candidate, Al Mobley, a conservative-independent who emphasized his opposition to abortion.</p>
        <p>In the northwest corner of the state, Mike Kopetski, a Democrat, mounted another strong campaign against Representative Denny Smith, a Republican. Mr. Kopetski fell just 707 votes short of Mr. Smith two years ago. This time, Mr. Smith was hurt by a combination of bad publicity over his links to the savings and loan industry, a heavy-handed radio advertisement that featured sound of a Hitler rally as Mr. Smith accused Mr. Kopetski of "appeasement," and Mr. Smith's support of the timber industry.</p>
        <p>Democrats currently control both the House and Senate, but the loss of only two House seats would cost them control there and give the Republicans a chance to influence redistricting next year.  UTAH</p>
        <p>Representative Wayne Owens of Salt Lake City, who has been the only Democrat in Utah's delegation, defeated a challenge from Genevieve Atwood, a 44-year old Republican who is a former state representative and former state geologist.</p>
        <p>Another Democrat, Bill Orton, will join the delegation, in the Provo seat left open by Representative Howard C. Nielson, a Republican who is retiring. Mr. Orton, a tax lawyer and first-time candidate, won a battle for the traditionally Republican seat by defeating former State Senator Karl Snow, a professor and administrator at Brigham Young University, who was the subject of a Provo Herald investigation into his ownership of certain stocks and his business association with a convicted felon.  WASHINGTON</p>
        <p>Two spirited House contests and ballot refer endums on tax limita tions and the environ ment confronted the voters.</p>
        <p>From the moment that Representative Jolene Unsoeld was elected to Congress in 1988 by only 618 votes, she became a leading target of the Republicans. Her opponent was Bob Williams, a former State Representative. He accused Mrs.Unsoeld of being a typical "tax and spend liberal." She said Mr. Williams was anti-environment and conservative.</p>
        <p>In another contest, Representative John Miller, a conservative Republican in his third term representing the First Congressional District in northern Seattle, was challenged by Cynthia Sullivan, a member of the King County Council. She said Mr. Miller had neglected local problems, including traffic congestion, and voted wrong on environmental issues. But his endorsement by the Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters deflated that issue.</p>
        <p>The ballot included proposals to limit property taxes to 1 percent of the true value of property and to give preferred treatment to properties that complied with safety and health standards or had low-income housing.  WYOMING</p>
        <p>Wyoming Democrats conceded they never had much chance of defeating Senator Alan K. Simpson, a national figure who is the second most powerful Republican in the Senate. The best candidate they could come up with was Kathy Helling, a 32-year-old sociology major at the University of Wyoming who defeated five other equally unknown primary candidates.</p>
        <p>It was a lopsided contest. Mrs. Helling spent about $6,000 on her losing campaign, compared with more than $1 million raised by Mr. Simpson.</p>
        <p>In Wyoming's sole Congressional district, Craig Thomas, a Republican who was chosen in a special election last year to replace Dick Cheney when he was named Secretary of Defense, ran against Peter Maxfield, a Democratic lawyer.</p>
        <p>Gov. Michael Sullivan, a Democrat, won re-election, defeating Mary Mead.</p>

        <p>He won easily over Jim Gallaway, a 50-year-old lawyer and former Marine who achieved considerable financial success with his own telecommunications companies.</p>
        <p>In the Second District, four-term Representative Barbara F. Vucanovich, a Republican, defeated Jane Wisdom, a State Assemblywoman. NEW MEXICO</p>
        <p>With the incumbent Governor, Garrey Carruthers, ineligible to try for re-election, former Gov. Bruce King was the Democratic candidate for the post.</p>
        <p>In an energetic race, he beat former State Representative Frank Bond, the Republican candidate.</p>
        <p>The 66-year-old Mr. King, a rancher and businessman, was Governor from 1971 to 974 and again from 1979 to 1982. In this year's campaign, he stressed education, the environment and economic development. To spur economic development, he called for steps to create more growth in the state's private business sector.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bond, a 47-year-old lawyer and rancher with land interests, also stressed economic policies, calling for various measures to promote diversfied development and create additonal jobs in the state.</p>
        <p>Senator Pete V. Domenici, a third-term Republican, crushed his challenger, Democratic State Senator Tom R. Benavides.  OREGON</p>
        <p>After four terms in the Senate, Mark O. Hatfield, the Republican once best known as a dove on defense issues, defeated Harry Lonsdale, a wealthy Democratic businessman with environmental credentials. But Mr. Lonsdale's appeal forced Mr. Hatfield into an aggressive and uncharacteristically negative campaign.</p>
        <p>In the race for governor, Attorney General David Frohnmayer, a Republican, went into the campaign a favorite to succeed Gov. Neil Goldschmidt, a Democrat who is retiring. But by the end of the campaign, Secretary of State Barbara Roberts, a Democrat, came on strong.</p>
        <p>Support for Mr. Frohnmayer was partly eroded by a third candidate, Al Mobley, a conservative-independent who emphasized his opposition to abortion.</p>
        <p>In the northwest corner of the state, Mike Kopetski, a Democrat, mounted another strong campaign against Representative Denny Smith, a Republican. Mr. Kopetski fell just 707 votes short of Mr. Smith two years ago. This time, Mr. Smith was hurt by a combination of bad publicity over his links to the savings and loan industry, a heavy-handed radio advertisement that featured sound of a Hitler rally as Mr. Smith accused Mr. Kopetski of "appeasement," and Mr. Smith's support of the timber industry.</p>
        <p>Democrats currently control both the House and Senate, but the loss of only two House seats would cost them control there and give the Republicans a chance to influence redistricting next year.  UTAH</p>
        <p>Representative Wayne Owens of Salt Lake City, who has been the only Democrat in Utah's delegation, defeated a challenge from Genevieve Atwood, a 44-year old Republican who is a former state representative and former state geologist.</p>
        <p>Another Democrat, Bill Orton, will join the delegation, in the Provo seat left open by Representative Howard C. Nielson, a Republican who is retiring. Mr. Orton, a tax lawyer and first-time candidate, won a battle for the traditionally Republican seat by defeating former State Senator Karl Snow, a professor and administrator at Brigham Young University, who was the subject of a Provo Herald investigation into his ownership of certain stocks and his business association with a convicted felon.  WASHINGTON</p>
        <p>Two spirited House contests and ballot refer endums on tax limita tions and the environ ment confronted the voters.</p>
        <p>From the moment that Representative Jolene Unsoeld was elected to Congress in 1988 by only 618 votes, she became a leading target of the Republicans. Her opponent was Bob Williams, a former State Representative. He accused Mrs.Unsoeld of being a typical "tax and spend liberal." She said Mr. Williams was anti-environment and conservative.</p>
        <p>In another contest, Representative John Miller, a conservative Republican in his third term representing the First Congressional District in northern Seattle, was challenged by Cynthia Sullivan, a member of the King County Council. She said Mr. Miller had neglected local problems, including traffic congestion, and voted wrong on environmental issues. But his endorsement by the Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters deflated that issue.</p>
        <p>The ballot included proposals to limit property taxes to 1 percent of the true value of property and to give preferred treatment to properties that complied with safety and health standards or had low-income housing.  WYOMING</p>
        <p>Wyoming Democrats conceded they never had much chance of defeating Senator Alan K. Simpson, a national figure who is the second most powerful Republican in the Senate. The best candidate they could come up with was Kathy Helling, a 32-year-old sociology major at the University of Wyoming who defeated five other equally unknown primary candidates.</p>
        <p>It was a lopsided contest. Mrs. Helling spent about $6,000 on her losing campaign, compared with more than $1 million raised by Mr. Simpson.</p>
        <p>In Wyoming's sole Congressional district, Craig Thomas, a Republican who was chosen in a special election last year to replace Dick Cheney when he was named Secretary of Defense, ran against Peter Maxfield, a Democratic lawyer.</p>
        <p>Gov. Michael Sullivan, a Democrat, won re-election, defeating Mary Mead.</p>
