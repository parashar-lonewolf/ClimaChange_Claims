        <p>Several studies have concluded that tens of thousands of deaths are being caused in the United States each year by a form of air pollution that for the most part falls within current legal limits: tiny particles of soot that are inhaled.</p>
        <p>Rough calculations emerging from studies at the Environmental Protection Agency and the Harvard School of Public Health suggest that 50,000 to 60,000 deaths a year are caused by the particle pollution, a far larger number than any other form of pollution and one that rivals the death toll from some cancers.</p>
        <p>The deaths occur mostly among children with respiratory problems, people of all ages with asthma and the elderly with illnesses like bronchitis, emphysema and pneumonia. Sources of Particles</p>
        <p>The new findings, disclosed gradually over the last two and a half years, will require environmental scientists and industries to re-evaluate their approaches to air pollution, and will probably require the Federal Government to rewrite its standard for particle pollution. The troublesome particles are mainly thrown into the air by industrial plants, with a small proportion coming from the exhausts of diesel vehicles.</p>
        <p>Paul Portney, vice president of Resources for the Future, a not-for-profit environmental research group, said that of the $35 billion a year the nation spends for all its scrubbers, catalytic converters and other air-pollution control efforts, only a fraction is directed toward the small particles, which are 10 microns or smaller in diameter. (By comparison, a human hair is about 75 microns in diameter.)</p>
        <p>Only one-third of all air pollution expenditures go to remove particles, and most of that goes to decades-old efforts like devices on power plants that catch only particles larger than 10 microns in diameter. Need to Review Standard</p>
        <p>Regulatory effort has been focused more on other types of pollution, like ozone and sulphur dioxide, that have been shown to damage health; it is uncertain whether they cause death. It is believed that indoor air pollution like second-hand cigarette smoke and radon cause the greatest health damage among pollutants, apart from the particles. Each is estimated to cause 5,000 or more cancers a year.</p>
        <p>Representative Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat who heads the House Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment, said: "The E.P.A. must now undertake a thorough review of the particle standard. The agency under the Bush Administration never even got started with the legal requirements that this standard be reviewed. By law it should have been finished last year."</p>
        <p>Ronald H. White, director of environmental health for the American Lung Association, said the evidence for deaths due to particle pollution was now great enough that the association would soon sue the E.P.A. in hope of getting the agency to revise its standard and begin stricter enforcement of it.</p>
        <p>But some scientists say the evidence is not yet good enough to make policy decisions. The evidence is based on epidemiological studies, which cannot conclusively establish a cause-and-effect relation between a substance and its health effect; for that, detailed biological studies of the effect of substances on the tissues themselves are needed.</p>
        <p>Dr. Jonathan Samet of the University of New Mexico said: "What is missing is understanding the biological basis of the effect they are describing. We shouldn't make major policy decisions about causes of death based on the kind of evidence we have so far.</p>
        <p>"The effects are not massive, not like the London fog of 1952 in which thousands of people died, but are more subtle. Before we make the big decision to control particles more, with the costs of doing that, we need to fill out the story more. We need to do actual exposure studies with people to see how particles affect them."</p>
        <p>Dr. Samet said he believed that there still might be other ways of explaining the deaths linked to pollution -- for example, combinations of factors like respiratory illness, coming with a heat wave, at the same time as a pollution episode. 'Need for More Data'</p>
        <p>Rob D. Brenner, chief of policy in the E.P.A.'s air pollution office, said: "We have a real concern about the new data. If it turns out that recent analyses show that particles are the much more significant problem than they seemed to be, our efforts to control particles and our acid rain initiatives will not be enough. We will have to do more." But he added that there was now a debate within the agency about what to do.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. missed last year's deadline to review and update the particle standard. It appears that unless a significant policy change occurs soon, the delay will continue for some time.</p>
        <p>"One of the things we feel on the research side very strongly is the need for more data," said Dr. Peter W. Preuss, the E.P.A.'s director of policy for the Office of Research and Development. But because of limited manpower in agency laboratories, he said, "I'm not sure we are going to do any of that research soon."</p>
        <p>In early budget estimates, the E.P.A. has not set aside money to review the particle standard for the next fiscal year, but the agency is planning to spend $10 million to revise the ozone standard.</p>
        <p>Particles have been among the most obvious and longest-known forms of pollution. During times of stagnant air, the particles make a haze or fog that blankets cities or rural valleys. Such pollution has been recorded as early as the 17th century in England. Among the most famous episodes was the London pea soup of 1952 that killed 4,000 people in a few days. Difficult to Study</p>
        <p>But particle pollution has been relatively neglected and difficult to study. Particles of all kinds are in air, so the polluted substance that must be studied is "urban air," a hodgepodge with clumps that vary in size and chemical makeup and that change from one location to another and from day to day.</p>
        <p>This makes for a messy experiment when researchers try to expose animals to "urban air" in a laboratory. In addition, it has been difficult to separate the components of air pollution because sulfur dioxide, ozone and soot all tend to be pumped into the air together and are present when samples are taken.</p>
        <p>Thus, until now, particle pollution has been relatively neglected while other types of pollution like ozone and sulfur dioxide have been much scrutinized.</p>
        <p>The discovery that particles are the worst type of air pollution was eventually made because of several coincidences.</p>
        <p>There is believed to be only one place in the United States that has a very large amount of pollution that is made up almost entirely of particles, while being low in ozone and sulfur dioxide. In this place, Utah Valley, there is only one large source of pollution, a steel mill, which was operated continuously for years, then shut down for a year because of a strike, and then turned on again.</p>
        <p>Because the area has long had hospital admission records and others computerized, the Utah Valley has become sort of an experiment designed specifically to discover the effect of particle pollution.</p>
        <p>Into this ready-made experiment came Dr. C. Arden Pope 3d, an environmental economist at Texas A &amp; M University who moved to Provo, Utah, a few years ago. Brown Cloud in the Sky</p>
        <p>"It was clear that Utah Valley had a pollution problem," Dr. Pope said. "I could see it in the air: in the winter time there is a combination fog and smog, sort of a brown cloud hanging in the air."</p>
        <p>Dr. Pope checked hospital admissions before, during and after the steel mill strike, and compared those to the level of small particles in the air. This kind of pollution is the most worrisome because it can be breathed into the lungs; it consists of particles 10 microns or smaller in diameter.</p>
        <p>He saw that the admissions to the hospital for respiratory-related illnesses like pneumonia and asthma jumped 50 percent to 90 percent during the times the particle pollution was above 50 micrograms of breathable particles for each cubic meter of air, and dropped when the plant was closed and fewer particles were in the air. The Federal Government's standard does not consider air hazardous until it reaches 150 micrograms of such particles per cubic meter.</p>
        <p>At the E.P.A., Dr. Joel Schwartz, the lone epidemiologist among scores of toxicologists, noticed the report, which was published in The American Journal of Public Health.</p>
        <p>Dr. Schwartz also found that another scientist, Dr. Douglas W. Dockery of the Harvard School of Public Health, had carried out studies of daily pollution levels in six Eastern cities. There, the particle pollution had been measured every day, an unusually good record since the Federal Government requires only one measurement a week.</p>
        <p>Soon the three scientists were working together, carrying out their own studies in Utah; Steubenville, Ohio, and Philadelphia, as well as digging up data from other cities. Decline in Lung Capacity</p>
        <p>In Utah, further studies found that children's breathing, as measured by a spirometer, was reduced when particle measurements were high: they lost about 6 percent of capacity if the pollution went up to the legal limit of 150 micrograms. They found a decline of about 3 percent in lung capacity of adults for each 100 micrograms measured in the air.</p>
        <p>The three scientists also found that the death rate in Utah rose in proportion to particles in the air, on a steady slope in which each 100 micrograms of particle pollution increased the death rate 16 percent.</p>
        <p>The pollution during this period was steadily below the legal limit, and averaged 47 micrograms, less than a third of the Federal standard.</p>
        <p>They also found that particles were directly linked to health effects and the increasing or decreasing of ozone or sulfur dioxide were not. Steady Rise in Deaths</p>
        <p>The scientists also noted that the effects of high particle levels were noted immediately, on the first day of high levels, and trailed off after several days of lower levels.</p>
        <p>In Steubenville, from 1974 to 1984, they found a steady rise in deaths of 4 percent for every 100 micrograms of particle pollution, at the same time no association was found with ozone pollution.</p>
        <p>In St. Louis, deaths increased 16 percent for each 100 micrograms of particles, and in a study in East Tennessee, deaths increased 17 percent for each 100 micrograms. In both these studies, death rates were increased somewhat in association with sulfur dioxide and ozone, but at levels far smaller than the association with particles.</p>
        <p>One of the largest studies, looking at particle pollution and deaths between 1973 and 1980 in Philadelphia, found that deaths increased about 7 percent for each 100 micrograms of particles, and 5 percent with each 100 micrograms of sulfur dioxide.</p>
        <p>All of the studies were designed to take into account other factors that might have explained lung problems, including other pollutants, smoking, and extremely hot or cold weather.</p>
        <p>Despite the apparent large threat of particle pollution, Dr. Schwartz said he was optimistic that the E.P.A. could reduce the pollution with relatively small economic damage to the country.</p>
        <p>"If we consider how much protection we can get for our money, we can do a lot with a relatively small investment," Dr. Schwartz said. He said that taking particles out of smoke stack emissions was relatively cheap, and some newer devices like "bag houses," filter-lined bags like vacuum cleaner bags, now can draw as much as 99 percent of particles out of the air without companies having to expend great sums on catalytic converters.</p>
