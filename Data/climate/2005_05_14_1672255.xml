        <p>Pentagon Proposes Closing Nearly 180 Military Bases.  The Pentagon recommended closing nearly 180 installations and offices from Hawaii to Maine, in the first major restructuring of the nation's vast military network in a decade.</p>
        <p>Ranging from tiny Army Reserve centers to giant Air Force bases that have been the economic anchors of their communities, the proposed closings, consolidations or reductions of some 800 military facilities and the loss of 26,000 military and civilian jobs sent shock waves across all 50 states. [Page A1.]</p>
        <p>Testimony on After-Hours Trading  At the trial of a former Bank of America broker, the investor Edward J. Stern testified that he had considered his ability to trade after hours a ''nice insurance'' against losses. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Heart Study of Taser Finds No Harm  An independent academic study of Taser electric stun weapons has found that they do not cause heart rhythm disturbances when used for short periods on healthy adults. The report is the first to monitor directly the effects of Tasers on human heart rhythm. It appears to confirm earlier studies performed on pigs that show that Tasers are unlikely to cause ventricular fibrillation -- a lethal heart disturbance -- when they are used for less than five seconds on healthy adults. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Product Ties for Microsoft and Sun  Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, and his counterpart and onetime archenemy at Sun Microsystems, Scott McNealy, took the stage in California to report on efforts to make their software programs communicate. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Microsoft and Toshiba have signed an agreement to cross-license their patents on computer software and digital consumer electronics, the two companies said. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Biotech Drugs Gain Against Cancer  New drugs using the tools of biotechnology are helping to prevent relapses among cancer patients and prolonging some lives, cancer specialists said. [A9.]</p>
        <p>Source of Severed Finger Found  The severed finger that a woman claimed to have found in a bowl of Wendy's chili in March belongs to an associate of the woman's husband, the police in California said. [A9.]</p>
        <p>Another Play for Allied Domecq  The Constellation Group, the world's largest wine producer, turned up the heat in the takeover battle for Allied Domecq, making a preliminary offer that executives involved in the talks said was worth about $14.3 billion. [C3.]</p>
        <p>Italian Utility to Be Acquired  Électricité de France and a Milan utility agreed to buy Edison, Italy's second-biggest electricity company. [C3.]</p>
        <p>Mayors Join on Global Warming  In an implicit rejection of White House policy, 132 mayors across the country have joined a bipartisan coalition to carry out the Kyoto Protocol on global warming. [A9.]</p>
        <p>Blue Chips Fall; Tech Shares Rise  The Dow Jones industrial average fell 49.36 points, to close at 10,140.12. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index dipped 5.31 points, to end at 1,154.05. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 12.92 points, to finish at 1,976.80. Only the Nasdaq finished higher for the week. The Dow was down almost 2 percent for the week. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Inventories Increased in March  American businesses increased inventories by 0.4 percent in March. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index showed a larger-than-expected drop in confidence. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Delphi Posts a Quarterly Loss  Delphi, the auto parts supplier, posted a quarterly loss, citing production cuts at General Motors, a major customer. [C4.]</p>
