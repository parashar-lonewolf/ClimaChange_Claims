        <p>It came, quite literally, as a bolt out of the blue. Scientists thought they understood lightning until they stumbled upon a whole new class of the displays that flash upward from thunderheads to heights as great as 60 miles above the earth, their wispy tendrils playing along the fringes of outer space. The bizarre flashes are visually stunning, their bodies pink, blood red and dark blue, their tendrils red, bluish and purple.</p>
        <p>Scientists, led by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, are now scurrying around the globe to study the phenomenon and its implications. The high-altitude flashes, they say, might affect the ozone layer in unknown ways and present dangers to spy planes arcing unusually high through the sky or space shuttles streaking toward earth for a landing.</p>

        <p>Scientists, led by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, are now scurrying around the globe to study the phenomenon and its implications. The high-altitude flashes, they say, might affect the ozone layer in unknown ways and present dangers to spy planes arcing unusually high through the sky or space shuttles streaking toward earth for a landing.</p>
        <p>Hidden for ages, the baffling flashes were first photographed in 1989 by accident. That finding touched off a global hunt by ground observers, aircraft and spacecraft, whose combined efforts have now managed to glimpse and photograph the ephemeral dance of the unfamiliar lightning hundreds of times. At least two new varieties have emerged: red sprites and blue jets. Excited researchers say there may be others. WILLIAM J. BROAD</p>
