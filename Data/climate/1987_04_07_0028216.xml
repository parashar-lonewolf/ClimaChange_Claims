        <p>LEAD: HURRICANES 40 to 50 percent more destructive could be a byproduct of the gradual warming of the earth expected over the next half-century, according to new calculations by a climate modeler at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
        <p>HURRICANES 40 to 50 percent more destructive could be a byproduct of the gradual warming of the earth expected over the next half-century, according to new calculations by a climate modeler at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
        <p>Powerful tropical storms would be among the most costly results of the greenhouse effect, the trapping of heat in the atmosphere by increased levels of carbon dioxide and manmade gases. The calculations predict that warmer ocean surfaces would feed the storms, raising wind speeds to new extremes.</p>
        <p>Hurricanes draw their strength from the heat of the oceans and convert that heat into mechanical energy in the form of strong winds. A computer model by Dr. Kerry A. Emanuel, the study's author, suggests that predicted increases of 4 or 5 degrees Fahrenheit in ocean temperatures would lead to great increases in destructive force.</p>
        <p>Dr. Emanuel acknowledged that the prediction depended on many uncertain estimates. Neither the amount of warming over the next decades nor the effect of warmer oceans on the dynamics of storms can be reliably assessed. Computer models of the physical processes remain ''quite crude,'' Dr. Emanuel noted.</p>
        <p>Commenting on the study, which was reported in the journal Nature, Richard Anthes, director of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., said the projections were quite plausible. ''Long-range planning should take into account these things,'' he said. ''I think it's probably a real effect.''  SCIENCE WATCH</p>
