        <p>Editorial contends that if UN is to recover from its recent serial batterings, bold reforms are needed right away; says Sec Gen Kofi Annan has begun that process by calling on member states to approve wide range of reforms at special General Assembly meeting; endorses Annan's agenda, especially his call for developed countries to establish timetables for living up to their promises to commit 0.7 percent of their gross national incomes to development aid by 2015 and for poor countries to come up with strategies for putting this aid to effective use; urges Pres Bush to be more cooperative with UN</p>

        <p>Large organizations like the United Nations are notoriously resistant to change. But if the U.N. is to recover from its recent serial batterings and start promoting economic and social development, fighting nuclear proliferation and nurturing democracy, bold reforms are needed right away.</p>
        <p>Secretary General Kofi Annan has begun that process by calling on member states to approve a wide range of reforms at a special General Assembly meeting this September. We strongly endorse Mr. Annan's agenda, especially his call for developed countries to establish timetables for living up to their promises to commit 0.7 percent of their gross national incomes to development aid by 2015 (the United States now contributes 0.18 percent) and for poor countries to come up with strategies for putting this aid to effective use. His proposals also take on the crucial issue of climate change, asking for a broad framework to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions after the Kyoto Protocol expires in 2012. This new agreement would include rich and poor countries, thus meeting one of Washington's major objections to the Kyoto approach.</p>

        <p>Large organizations like the United Nations are notoriously resistant to change. But if the U.N. is to recover from its recent serial batterings and start promoting economic and social development, fighting nuclear proliferation and nurturing democracy, bold reforms are needed right away.</p>
        <p>Secretary General Kofi Annan has begun that process by calling on member states to approve a wide range of reforms at a special General Assembly meeting this September. We strongly endorse Mr. Annan's agenda, especially his call for developed countries to establish timetables for living up to their promises to commit 0.7 percent of their gross national incomes to development aid by 2015 (the United States now contributes 0.18 percent) and for poor countries to come up with strategies for putting this aid to effective use. His proposals also take on the crucial issue of climate change, asking for a broad framework to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions after the Kyoto Protocol expires in 2012. This new agreement would include rich and poor countries, thus meeting one of Washington's major objections to the Kyoto approach.</p>
        <p>Mr. Annan made useful recommendations addressing nuclear weapons proliferation, including a treaty to cut off production of fissile nuclear materials and strengthened inspections under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The treaty needs not just tougher inspections, but also new language tightening restrictions on uranium and plutonium processing plants that can be used to make bomb fuel.</p>
        <p>On the organizational side, the proposals aim at eliminating one of the United Nations' great embarrassments, a Human Rights Commission whose seats have been filled by regional rotation, letting egregious violators of human rights like Cuba, Libya and Sudan sit in judgment of other countries' performance. In place of this, Mr. Annan proposes a more credible and authoritative human rights council chosen by a two-thirds vote of all member states. He also wants this to be the year the Security Council adds new members to better reflect the realities of today's world. The current lineup, particularly the five veto-wielding permanent members -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- emerged from the geopolitics of 1945, the year the U.N. was founded. Unfortunately, most specific plans for enlargement have problems of their own, with regional rivalries over who can best represent Africa, South Asia or Latin America.</p>
        <p>Many of the problems that have tarnished the U.N.'s reputation in recent years have been self-inflicted, including the scandalous maladministration of the oil-for-food program and the sexual assaults committed by U.N. peacekeepers in Congo. But the overriding problem has been Washington's virtually unremitting hostility. The United Nations simply cannot function effectively when it is being cold-shouldered by its most powerful member and largest financial contributor. Not all of Mr. Annan's specific suggestions will be popular in Washington. But by helping to negotiate a strong international consensus behind a meaningful set of reform proposals, President Bush can give substance to his repeated vows to work more cooperatively with other nations in his second term.</p>
