        <p>TENS of thousands of babies born prematurely every year struggle in intensive care, often in incubators, until they are strong enough to survive on their own. But many infants born between four and six months of pregnancy, the second trimester, do not survive for even a few minutes because their lungs are so undeveloped they cannot breathe.</p>
        <p>Believing that those born this early can be saved, a Philadelphia obstetrician has patented an artificial uterus that would suspend a fetus in a liquid environment until its lungs matured.</p>
        <p>"At approximately 10 weeks, all the major organ systems are developed to where the baby could survive in an intensive-care-unit environment -- except the lungs," said Dr. William Cooper, head of the Christian Fertility Institute in Easton, Pa. At that point, a fetus is still dependent on the mother for oxygen and nutrients..</p>
        <p>Dr. Cooper's invention is a small chamber divided into upper and lower sections. The lower half would be filled with synthetic amniotic fluid, imitating the natural liquid that surrounds a fetus in the womb.</p>
        <p>When a woman goes into premature labor, doctors will use drugs to try to stop delivery. If that fails, Dr. Cooper believes that very premature fetuses could be removed by emergency Caesarean surgery, with the umbilical cord and placenta intact, and placed in the artificial uterus. The fetus would float in the liquid solution of the uterus's lower half. Its umbilical cord would reach through to the upper part, where the placenta would be spread over the horizontal shelf dividing the two areas.</p>
        <p>"The placenta would need to be bathed with a solution containing high oxygen and nutrients" to feed the developing fetus, Dr. Cooper said. "It would in return carry off carbon dioxide and waste products. It would essentially be a mechanical placenta.</p>
        <p>"At 24 weeks, a baby has very little chance of surviving, while at 28 weeks it has a 90 percent chance," he said. "If we can just hold it for that period, it would be time enough for its lungs to mature." Doctors would confirm that by checking for chemicals the lungs produce. The invention must be tested on large mammals like primates, Dr. Cooper said.</p>
        <p>He received patent 5,218,958. Seat Belts for Use During Pregnancy</p>
        <p>Statistics show persuasively that safety restraints save lives in auto accidents. But the lap-belt portion of seat belts can be so dangerous to pregnant women that doctors have long debated whether expectant mothers should wear them at all.</p>
        <p>Trying to reconcile the need for belts with the risk of potentially injuring a fetus, Dr. Ethel Grene has patented a safety restraint that straps around a woman's thighs and chest.</p>
        <p>"It's a question of preventing the lap belt from riding up and injuring the bulge," Dr. Grene, an emergency-room physician at hospitalsin northern Indiana, said. In accidents and sudden stops, "the prime concern is rupturing the uterus, or direct trauma to the fetus like skull injuries, or ruptured spleen or liver."</p>
        <p>Her invention would be purchased separately from the car and could be used in any vehicle. The lower straps would attach to the base of a car seat and restrain the woman's thighs. The upper straps would fit around the seat back and her chest. Dr. Grene's patent is No. 5,215,345. Flood Levees From Old Tires</p>
        <p>Some of the levees that have given way along the Mississippi River in the last couple of weeks failed because the water forced breaches in the barriers, which then kept widening. An engineer in Tacoma, Wash., says that an underwater construction system, one using old car tires like a chain-link fence, could have helped to control the flooding.</p>
        <p>Robert Hamilton, a civilian Army engineer, did not set out to patent levees. What he wanted was to find a good use for the millions of tires discarded in this country each year. So he designed a construction system using tires as molds for concrete.</p>
        <p>"You drill holes in the tires and put metal rods through the holes, so they stick out the sides," Mr. Hamilton explained.</p>
        <p>The metal rods perform the same function as reinforcing bars in ordinary construction. Another rod, perpendicular to the first, is added to each tire. Concrete is then poured into the tires, which act as a mold.</p>
        <p>With drilling done through the tread, the tires would be connected or built up in layers by linking the reinforcing rods sticking out of the hardened concrete. Mr. Hamilton's system is intended to be used for underwater construction of artificial reefs, for bridge and dock foundations, for filling swamps and for building levees.</p>
        <p>"The Army Corps of Engineers talked to me about using the system along the Mississippi and the delta area where the land keeps sinking," he said. "The Mississippi River right now is a prime example. The levees will fail if the forces get to be too great. If you had tires all joined together, they would pull as a unit."</p>
        <p>Mr. Hamilton believes that his system can also be used for railroad track beds or under airport runways to serve as foundation and stabilizer. But underwater use is his focus.</p>
        <p>"In water," Mr. Hamilton said, "building reefs and so on seemed to be the best use of the tires because they don't decompose and could be used as they are, without taking further energy to break them down." His patent is No. 5,214,896.</p>
        <p>Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.</p>
