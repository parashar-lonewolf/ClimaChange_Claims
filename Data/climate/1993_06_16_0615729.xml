        <p>Following are excerpts from President Clinton's news conference today, as recorded by the Federal News Service, a transcription company: OPENING STATEMENT</p>
        <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to make a couple of opening remarks.</p>
        <p>First, let me say that this morning I had a good talk with Judge Ginsburg, complimenting her on her very moving statement yesterday, and I assured her that we were moving ahead with this confirmation process. I spoke with Senators Biden and Thurmond and Hatch and asked them to work with me to insure the speediest possible confirmation consistent with the Senate doing its duty. At any rate, I am confident that she will be ready to assume her position on the Supreme Court when the fall term begins in October.</p>
        <p>With regard to the economy, we've had since last Friday very good reports on low inflation in terms of both producer prices and consumer prices. And in a larger sense over the last few months, we've seen a continuing reduction in long-term interest rates, which have given us a 20-year low in mortgage rates, a seven-year high in housing sales, and have mightily contributed to the introduction into this economy of 755,000 new jobs, well over 90 percent of them in the private sector.</p>
        <p>I am confident that the continuation of this trend depends on our ability to pass a strong economic program through the Congress which reduces the deficits, increases investment in our future, and is fair in terms of requiring a fair apportionment of the burden. The plan that the House passed, that the Senate Finance Committee is now dealing with -- for every $10 that the deficit is reduced, $5 comes from spending cuts, $3.75 from upper-income people, $1.25 from the middle class, and families with incomes under $30,000 are held harmless.</p>
        <p>I hope that the principles I have outlined will be honored as this program moves through the Congress. The Senate Finance Committee has some tough decisions to make. I don't expect to agree with all of them, but I think they will produce a bill. I think the Senate will produce a bill. And then we can go on to conference and see what the final shape of the economic plan that the whole Congress will vote on will be. I'm encouraged, quite upbeat, by the reports I've received from Senator Moynihan, Senator Mitchell and others about the progress being made there, and I just want to encourage the Senate to move forward.</p>
        <p>Finally, let me say that the Senate is dealing with another very difficult and very important issue now, and that's campaign-finance reform. I have believed for a long time that we can't get thorough-going economic reform in our country until we have political reform. That requires the lobby-reform legislation that is moving its way through Congress -- but very importantly campaign-finance reform to lower the cost of campaigns, reduce the influence of special interests and PAC's, and open the airwaves to more honest debate. The troubling thing, obviously, is that the Republican senators have announced that they may yet again filibuster a bill. And the thing that particularly troubles me about this one is that several Republicans voted for a bill not unlike this last year which contained public financing. If, in fact, this filibuster occurs, it will be the second time that Republican senators who voted for a piece of progressive legislation when there was a Republican in the White House have now voted against it and have filibustered it. The first was on the motor-voter bill, where eventually we were able to work out the problems and get a bill passed.</p>
        <p>But I think this is very, very important, and I very much hope that the senators will reconsider and let this bill go forward. We need to pass a strong campaign-finance reform bill this year. Political reform and economic reform, in my judgment, over the long run must go hand in hand, and the time is long since past when we should have campaign-finance reform.</p>
        <p>Now, having said that, I think I ought to give Brit his follow-up. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</p>
        <p>Q. I hope you don't mind if I follow up on another subject, sir. In the House ----</p>
        <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON. You know what I'm really upset about? You got a honeymoon and I didn't.</p>
        <p>Q. Yes, sir, but you got to end it.</p>
        <p>A. Well, I -- let's extend it, then. Go ahead.</p>
        <p>Q. The House, liberals in particular, Black Caucus, in particular, seem in a somewhat mutinous mood as they watch the deliberations in the Senate on your economic program, and I'm wondering, sir, what you say to them to assure them that the tough vote they felt they cast for your program was not in vain and that you haven't really cut the rug out from under them.</p>
        <p>A. Well, I've not cut the rug out from under them at all. I have not agreed to any provision that the Senate Finance Committee is deliberating. There has been no agreement on any issue. I have set out principles: $500 billion in deficit reduction, a deficit reduction trust fund for all the tax increases and spending cuts, at least $250 billion in spending cuts, although I would like some more cuts and some less taxes. Seventy-five percent of the burden has to fall on upper-income people, and we ought to keep the incentives for growth and for empowerment of the working poor and the incentives to move people from welfare to work. Those are the things that I want to see in the final bill.</p>
        <p>And what I have assured the Black Caucus -- and let me say I have talked to, oh, probably 15 of the members in the last week or so just in that Caucus, and many other members of the House -- is that the principles that I outlined are still there and that we'll do our best to articulate those as the Senate deals with this bill, but the real test will be what happens in the conference and what the final bill looks like that the House and the Senate will vote on. And again, I'm quite encouraged that we'll get a bill out that they'll feel good about.</p>
        <p>They made it clear to me what they felt most strongly about, and the two things above all were the earned-income tax credit for the working poor, which is an important part of our welfare reform incentive, and the empowerment zones for the depressed urban and rural areas. And there are all kinds of parliamentary issues that, as you know, the Senate has to consider in all this, but I'm confident that in the end, the bill that they vote on in the House to send to me for signature will have those things in it.</p>
        <p>Q. Mr. President, do you perceive a loss of public confidence in your Presidency because of wavering domestically and in foreign policy? And what do you plan to do about it ----</p>
        <p>A. No. . . . There is no wavering. I mean, you know, if somebody had told you at Christmas time, Helen, that by June 1 we'd have unemployment under 7 percent for the first time in a year and a half, 755,000 new jobs, a 20-year low in interest rates, a seven-year high in housing sales, that the United States would have led a global effort to support Boris Yeltsin, signed the Global Warming Treaty -- that actually happened on, I mean, the Biodiversity Treaty, that actually happened on June the 4th -- passed family leave and passed the motor-voter legislation, repealed the gag rule and the ban on fetal-tissue research to allow more science and less politics in medical research, I'd say most people would think that was a pretty decisive record -- that we would have moved this budget through the House of Representatives, sent it to the Senate -- much tougher decisions than were required in the Reagan budget in 1981, on a faster track, on a faster track. I think people would have said at Christmas time, that's a pretty good and decisive record. We haven't solved the problem in Bosnia that has plagued everybody. I concede that.  The Europeans wouldn't go along with my proposed resolution. I still think they may be compelled to do that or something very near like it if they want to get anything done over there.</p>
        <p>And I think we're going forward. I like the Supreme Court judge that I picked. I don't think it shows any wavering at all on that.</p>
        <p>Q. You don't think there is a public feeling that you're indecisive ----</p>
        <p>A. Well, all I'm telling you is ----</p>
        <p>Q. I mean, on the highly touted issues of budget, Bosnia ----</p>
        <p>A. Let me tell you something about Bosnia.  On Bosnia, I made a decision. The United Nations controls what happens in Bosnia. I cannot unilaterally lift the arms embargo. I didn't change my mind. Our allies decided that they weren't prepared to go that far at this time. They asked me to wait and they said they would not support it. I didn't change my mind.</p>
        <p>And as far as the budget, I don't -- how can you say that? No President's budget has been taken seriously in this town for a dozen years. Three-quarters of the Republicans in the House of Representatives voted against President Bush's last budget. I sent a budget up there that passed -- the budget resolution passed on time for the first time in 17 years, and we're out here fighting for these tough decisions. How could anybody say -- this is the most decisive Presidency you've had in a very long time on all the big issues that matter. And I might say all the heat we're getting from people is because of the decisions that have been made, not because of those that haven't.</p>
        <p>. . .</p>
        <p>Q. Mr. President, getting back to Judge Ginsburg for a moment, I know you -- you're familiar with her Madison lecture and her rather provocative statements about the judicial reach of Roe v. Wade. Can you tell me how comfortable you are with her challenge to the whole theoretical concept to that landmark ruling and whether you feel confident that she will, once on the court, meet what you had said during the campaign were your concerns about continuing ----</p>
        <p>A. The -- I think if you read the lecture -- she is clearly pro-choice in the sense that she believes the Government should not make that decision for the women of America. She disagrees with the rationale of the decision. I'm not sure I agree with her, as a matter of fact, on that issue, but I thought it was a very provocative and impressive argument. And she -- as a matter of fact, you know, I have always thought that Roe v. Wade was the most difficult case decided in the last 25 years because it was such a difficult issue and that the court would have -- did the best it could under the circumstances. She made a very interesting alternative suggestion, but there is no suggestion in any of her writings that she's not pro-choice, and was to me the important thing.</p>
        <p>. . .</p>
        <p>Q. In regard to Judge Ginsburg, do you have any regrets about the process that led to her nomination?</p>
        <p>A. Yeah, I have one big regret ----</p>
        <p>Q. Mr. Babbitt and Mr. Breyer's names as the front runners?</p>
        <p>A. Well, first of all, I strongly dispute that I hung them out. I regret the leaks, but it's not fair to say I hung them out. Any senator I talk to will tell you: when I called to discuss Judge Breyer, I also said I've got someone else I'm looking at. Anybody will tell you that. I told Bruce Babbitt the first day I called him: "I want to know if you agree to be considered -- I don't -- if the country can afford to lose you as Interior Secretary."</p>
        <p>. . .</p>
        <p>Q. Sir, we have not had the opportunity to ask you your reaction to the derogatory remarks about you that were reportedly made by the Air Force general in Europe. How did you feel when you heard about that, and why have you tolerated it the way you have?</p>
        <p>A. First of all, I have not tolerated it, I have simply permitted the Air Force to handle this in the ordinary course of business, as I thought was appropriate. The Air Force is dealing with this issue. I have been fully briefed on it.</p>
        <p>I had two feelings about it, frankly. For me, personally, I didn't care. People say whatever they want to say about me personally. It had no impact on me. And I thought, well, here's a guy who's served his country and, you know, so what if he doesn't like me and he doesn't know me from Adam's -- (inaudible). So, you know, he's just repeating something he's heard. But for a general officer to say that about the Commander in Chief, if that happened, is a very bad thing.</p>
