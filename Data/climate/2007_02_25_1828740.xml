        <p>THE world is supposed to contract in the winter, to shrink inside a dark shell, to tighten like a drum. The sun retracts, the light drains, the warmth leaks away. A bony carapace grows over the land, and the soul. Everything soft and green deflates, hardens to a gray, stony core.</p>
        <p>This winter, though, the wires got crossed. Fishermen gassed up their boats, golfers dug their clubs out of the corners of their garages. Runners needed nothing but T-shirts and shorts. Farmers harvested leeks in January. Perennials debated whether it was time to bloom. The annual Florida diaspora began to look like a quaint anachronism from an era before global warming. Why bother migrating south when the south had migrated north?</p>

        <p>THE world is supposed to contract in the winter, to shrink inside a dark shell, to tighten like a drum. The sun retracts, the light drains, the warmth leaks away. A bony carapace grows over the land, and the soul. Everything soft and green deflates, hardens to a gray, stony core.</p>
        <p>This winter, though, the wires got crossed. Fishermen gassed up their boats, golfers dug their clubs out of the corners of their garages. Runners needed nothing but T-shirts and shorts. Farmers harvested leeks in January. Perennials debated whether it was time to bloom. The annual Florida diaspora began to look like a quaint anachronism from an era before global warming. Why bother migrating south when the south had migrated north?</p>
        <p>A penitential blast of cold finally descended, abruptly and belatedly, in mid-January, culminating with a Valentine's Day storm that locked our region in a substance that had begun to seem endangered: ice. It was the kind of ice that we hadn't seen for a while, the kind of ice that lasted. The pond is actually frozen? Where are those skates?</p>
        <p>Shards of ice, shed by coated vehicles, littered the roads last week, as if the air itself had shattered from the sudden hammer of winter. As bleak a scene as it was, though, there was promise in it.</p>
        <p>The cold came so fast that the false spring of earlier weeks was, we can only hope, flash-frozen beneath that brittle crust. A warm, soft, green world is already growing under there, impatient to emerge. We know it, because we saw it already, when we weren't supposed to.</p>
