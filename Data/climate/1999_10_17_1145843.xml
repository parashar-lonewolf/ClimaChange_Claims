        <p>Some doomsayers these days claim that the book will soon be replaced by the computer chip. They're wrong -- but only about the kind of doom involved. What will replace the book is something else: the book tour. It's already happening.</p>
        <p>Even as the number of independent bookstores falls precipitously, and as the amount of time Americans spend reading serious books continues its long, slow decline, 367 authors have ''events'' scheduled this fall, according to the Publishers Weekly electronic listing of such things, and publishers are still making bookings. Just in the San Francisco Bay area, where I live, a recent Sunday newspaper listed 143 author events for the following week, from a group reading of new European poetry, with translations, to a chance to meet the author of ''Reaching for Reality: Seven Incredible True Stories of Alien Abduction.'' More preachers than ever are filling the pulpits while the believers ebb away. Our planet's Last Reader, fossilized in the act of turning the page by a sudden jump in global warming, will not be someone in a cozy armchair at home. It will be an author on tour, declaiming his or her own words in an empty bookstore.</p>
        <p>Many of us still writing books today feel somewhat the way a blacksmith must have felt around 1920. It's a wonderful trade, but. . . . I have to admit, however, that for me one consolation of the extended twilight of the book has been the book tour. I've never completely believed writers who say they find book tours totally wearisome. Can anything be wearisome when I'm the center of attention all day long?</p>
        <p>Also, traveling around talking about what you've written, you meet people who are connected to the story. My last book was about the conquest of the Congo by Belgium's King Leopold II; in the course of touring for it I've met a Congolese whose grandfather was worked to death as a porter, Belgians who grew up on tales of heroic missionaries and the Paris real estate agent for Mobutu Sese Seko, the country's late kleptocrat. He described how Mobutu and his entourage would inspect properties very early in the morning, so as not to attract attention. I wish I could have put these stories in my book -- an argument, incidentally, for having the book tour precede the writing of the book, a proposal I will return to in a moment.</p>
        <p>In addition, while on the road you get to discuss your book with the country's best talkers. Intelligent American radio talk shows really came into their own around the same time that the book tour did, in the 1980's, and it's been a happy marriage. It would be hard to find better-read conversationalists than talk show hosts like Christopher Lydon in Boston or Milt Rosenberg in Chicago or Michael Krasny in San Francisco. The last two are college professors who moonlight on the radio.</p>
        <p>The less highbrow interviewers have their own appeal. A well-known right-wing host in New York once interviewed me while drunk. His swaying from side to side in his chair would have caused problems on television, but did not on radio. And the most colorful was Ed Schwartz, a popular and staunch liberal in Chicago whose show at WGN-AM went on the air at midnight and who billed himself at the time as ''The World's Largest Talk Show Host.'' He weighed, he said, 550 pounds, ''slimmed down from 650,'' and he wheezed painfully with every breath: ''We have with us -- eeeeeeesss! -- tonight a man who has written a book about -- eeeeeeeesss! . . .'' He sat across the table from his guests, who were already groggy from the hour, pushing his vast bulk past tiers of dials and switches on a wheeled desk chair, rolling into unlighted corners of the room during commercial breaks and then reappearing phantasmagorically, like a shadowy mountain emerging out of the darkness.</p>
        <p>Schwartz claimed a million listeners, and the phone lines lighted up with their calls: truck drivers on the Interstate near Omaha, insomniacs in Indianapolis, night shift workers in Duluth. Did any of them read books? I doubt it. But a million of them heard my voice, from midnight until I staggered away at 2 A.M., and perhaps that counts for something.</p>
        <p>Book tours are far more civilized in Europe. There are even certain hotels where publishers traditionally put visiting writers. I discovered this inadvertently when, coming downstairs one morning in Amsterdam, I found several television crews, not on my schedule, waiting in the lobby. Ha! -- clearly an unexpected, uncontrollable surge of Dutch media interest in me. But it turned out they were waiting for a Japanese novelist. When I checked out, the desk clerk asked for a copy of my book to add to their shelves. The hotel in Paris, appropriately situated on the Rue Sainte-Beuve (can you imagine an Edmund Wilson Street in the United States?), had a similar collection.</p>
        <p>The French, in fact, were the most civilized of all. This I realized at the Paris studio of an all-news radio network. In the United States, the interviewer would glance at the press release, talk to you for five minutes, then later quickly edit the tape down to two minutes for broadcast. In Paris, a very well-spoken man in a three-piece suit introduced himself and began asking me questions. I soon noticed that he was taking very careful notes, in an almost diagram-like format -- and that he hadn't turned the tape recorder on. He stopped and explained: ''We only have two minutes. However, I don't like to cut and splice tape. Ce n'est pas elegant. I prefer a conversation. But we will plan our conversation very carefully, so you can get all your major points across.'' We spent half an hour planning. Then he turned the tape recorder on for two minutes. When he turned it off, we spent another half-hour discussing his belief that one could say a lot in a short time. I inscribed my book to him  l'homme des deux minutes.</p>
        <p>The other nice thing about the French is that they have no literary incest taboo. This publication, for example, will not knowingly assign your book to a reviewer if he or she has ever been reviewed by you, or if you have more than a passing acquaintance with each other. In Paris, by contrast, the publisher takes you to lunch with the reviewer. Who says, ''What a wonderful book, Monsieur!'' while the publisher orders another bottle of Ctes du Rhne. Incestuous? Yes -- but how many times, in reviewing a book myself, have I wanted to ask the author something: why did you include X and ignore Y? It might have made for a better review.</p>
        <p>The book tour as an art form is evolving faster than the book itself. When Knopf sent Anne Rice on the road for her ''Vampire Armand'' last year, she combined bookstore appearances with a blood drive. Stores were paired with hospitals, and people who had given blood got to the head of the book-signing line. When Ann Mariah Cook took to the road this past winter to promote her book from Algonquin, ''Running North,'' about dog sledding in Alaska, she traveled between two New Hampshire bookstores by dog sled. The huskies attended the book signings. Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York, went on book tour this summer to promote his new novel -- and simultaneously to test the waters for a Senate run. Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota, whom some people want to run for President, was on the road at the same time promoting his own book, with three bodyguards in tow. And why shouldn't we have political campaigns by book tour? A Terry Gross interview is far more revealing than a sound bite.</p>
        <p>Finally, back to the question of sequence. Once you've been on tour awhile and have described your book 30 or 40 times, you see what makes people sit up and what makes their eyelids droop, and you find better ways of telling your story. And then you regret that you didn't use these fine images and turns of phrase in the book itself. Why not, then, have the book tour precede the writing of the book? Publishers might object -- but of course when the book tour comes to replace the book itself, that will no longer be an issue.</p>
        <p>Anyone who doubts that writers will still tour even when no one reads our books anymore should consider this story from the novelist and historian JoAnn Levy, writing in the Internet magazine Spotlight: ''In San Antonio . . . a Barnes &amp; Noble store asked 23 authors from a Women Writing the West conference to sign books at their store. Employees picked us up at our hotel, had a huge horseshoe of tables, backed with 23 chairs, and 23 stacks of books next to place cards with our names in calligraphy. Plus a big spread of cookies and coffee. Not one person came! Not one. . . . After an hour we started buying each other's books and then we ate all the cookies.''</p>
