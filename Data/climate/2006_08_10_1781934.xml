        <p>The two Republicans seeking to unseat Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton clashed ferociously last night in a debate that centered far more on questions of marital infidelity, nepotism and other personal attacks than on what either candidate would do if elected.</p>
        <p>Kathleen Troia McFarland, a former official in the Reagan-era Pentagon, repeatedly hammered John Spencer, a former mayor of Yonkers, for having an extramarital affair with a city employee while he was mayor, having relatives on the city payroll, and raising property taxes. Mr. Spencer fought back, accusing her of distorting his record with ''lies and innuendos and half-truths'' while ignoring her early pledge to run a positive campaign.</p>
        <p>''She's insulted my wife, she's insulted my children, she's insulted my military record, criticized my service in Vietnam,'' Mr. Spencer complained when he was asked about the tenor of the race. ''I do not think that my personal life, or Mrs. McFarland's personal life, or problems that she may be having, are part of the dialogue that the state and the people of New York care about, or the nation.''</p>
        <p>Ms. McFarland responded that the issues her campaign raised were fair game.</p>
        <p>''You brought up your wife, and I must tell you that that's not a personal issue,'' she said. ''That's a professional issue. Because when you were mayor of Yonkers, you had an affair with your secretary while you were married to somebody else. You tripled her salary and made her your chief of staff. You were living with her. You doubled your own personal income. You got financial gain from that. And you had two children.''</p>
        <p>Their debate, at Pace University in Manhattan, was the latest flashpoint in a primary campaign that has, at times, more closely resembled reality television than a Senate race.</p>
        <p>At one point, Ms. McFarland turned to Mr. Spencer and said, ''You taxed and spent like Hillary, and you've behaved like Bill.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Spencer retorted: ''That was probably worked on for months by her staff. To say, let's get the sound bite, you know? Let's get the sound bite, let's get the headline. What nonsense.''</p>
        <p>He bristled at the onslaught, saying that the woman he had gone on to marry had not been a secretary but ''a career professional with 22 years working for three former mayors and city managers.'' He asked how Ms. McFarland, as a woman, could insult ''another woman's career and her children.''</p>
        <p>''I say to you, Mrs. McFarland: Shame on you,'' he said. ''Shame on you as a mother of children and a woman yourself to talk about my wife and my family like that when we have such a serious campaign. I am at peace with my God and my loved ones.''</p>
        <p>The Democrats exulted. ''This was more like a Tom and Jerry cartoon than a Senate debate,'' said Blake Zeff, a spokesman for the state Democratic Party.</p>
        <p>Between the heated exchanges, a few areas of policy disagreement did emerge. Ms. McFarland expressed her support for abortion rights, while Mr. Spencer said he opposed abortion unless the life -- and not just the health -- of the mother was at stake.</p>
        <p>Ms. McFarland said she would revive the upstate economy by remaking it as a center of ''renewable energy,'' while Mr. Spencer said his experience as the mayor of a troubled city would help him assist upstate mayors.</p>
        <p>In a round of yes-or-no questions, both candidates agreed that Gov. George E. Pataki, a fellow Republican, had not been an excellent governor, and said he would not be re-elected if he were running this year. Mr. Spencer, noting that he is already the Conservative nominee for governor, said he would not support Ms. McFarland if she wins the Sept. 12 Republican primary.</p>
        <p>Their race pits two wings of the state's Republican Party, Ms. McFarland representing the more moderate branch and appealing to party elites, and Mr. Spencer running as an unabashed conservative.</p>
        <p>Ms. McFarland said several times that she had worked in ''the administrations of three Republican presidents'' while Mr. Spencer said she had been a ''Washington bureaucrat 25 years ago.''</p>
        <p>After she mentioned working with Henry A. Kissinger and near Donald H. Rumsfeld during the Ford administration, and said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman was ''an old college friend of my husband's,'' Mr. Spencer said there was ''more name-dropping going on here than -- I don't know what.''</p>
        <p>The debate was televised in New York City on NY1 News and on other channels across the state. It was also broadcast on several radio stations.</p>
        <p>The campaign was bitter long before the debate.</p>
        <p>''I don't think that anyone expected this to devolve into a cross between 'Dr. Phil' and 'Days of Our Lives,' '' said Nelson Warfield, a Republican strategist working for the state's Conservative Party, which is backing Mr. Spencer.</p>
        <p>The Spencer family was not the only one drawn into the campaign. Ms. McFarland's was, too. New York magazine published a letter she wrote to her parents saying why she had cut off contact with her brother Michael, who was gay and died of an AIDS-related illness.</p>
        <p>''Have you ever wondered why I have never had anything to do with Mike and have never let my daughters see him, although we live only 15 minutes away from each other?'' the letter says. ''He has been a lifelong homosexual, most of his relationships brief, fleeting one-night stands.''</p>
        <p>The publication of the letter led Ms. McFarland to announce that she had been physically abused while growing up.</p>
        <p>But when Ms. McFarland was asked about her family issues at the debate, she declined to respond.</p>
        <p>Then came the night's one peaceful moment. Mr. Spencer had nothing to say either, except, '' I wish her well, and guess what, at night I'll say a prayer for her.''</p>
        <p>Ms. McFarland said, ''And for that I thank you.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 11, 2006, Friday  An article yesterday about the debate between the Republican candidates for United States Senate from New York, Kathleeen Troia McFarland and John Spencer, incorrectly paraphrased a point that Mr. Spencer made when he said he would not support Ms. McFarland if she won the primary in September. In explaining that decision, he noted that he is already the Conservative Party's nominee for senator; he did not say he is its nominee for governor.</p>
