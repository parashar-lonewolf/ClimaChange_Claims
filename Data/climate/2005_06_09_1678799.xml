        <p>Bush administration officials said yesterday that revisions to reports on climate change made by Philip A. Cooney, a former oil-industry lobbyist now working at the White House, were part of the normal review before publishing projects that involved many agencies.</p>
        <p>At his morning briefing for reporters, the White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, defended Mr. Cooney's participation and said the reports were ''scientifically sound.''</p>
        <p>''There are policy people and scientists who are involved in this process, in the interagency review process, and he's one of the policy people involved in that process,'' Mr. McClellan said, according to a transcript by Federal News Service Inc. ''And he's someone who's very familiar with the issues relating to climate change and the environment.''</p>
        <p>The revisions, many of which cast doubt on findings that climate scientists say are robust, prompted strong criticisms of the administration from scientists and environmental groups after they were reported yesterday in The New York Times.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cooney, 45, is chief of staff to the White House Council on Environmental Quality, which helps shape and carry out the president's environmental policies. A lawyer with no scientific training, he moved to the White House in 2001 after having worked for more than 10 years for the American Petroleum Institute, the oil-industry lobby. His last title there was climate team leader, and his focus was defeating plans to restrict heat-trapping gases.</p>
        <p>Climate scientists in and out of government said it was wrong for a person with no scientific background, and a history of fighting actions to limit warming, to change the characterizations of scientific findings on climate in government reports.</p>
        <p>In response to questions, Mr. McClellan said the documents were all approved by government scientists and by an independent panel set up by the National Academies, the leading independent scientific body. President Bush's science adviser, Dr. John H. Marburger III, also approved the reports.</p>
