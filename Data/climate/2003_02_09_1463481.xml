        <p>FIRE-EATERS and timid eaters, diners seeking exotica and those who prefer the familiar will be able to eat a satisfying meal of light Thai food at Jaiya. The new restaurant, which opened two months ago at 46 West Old Country Road in Hicksville (516-681-3400), is Long Island's largest Thai-based eating place, with 165 seats. It has a pedigree a quarter of a century old from New York City. Virachart and Wanne Pokpoonpipat, the owners, began with a restaurant in Queens and for the last decade have run one in Manhattan. Like the others, the local Jaiya (it means darling) offers terrific Thai food with some Indian and Chinese wild cards, at easy-to-take-prices.</p>
        <p>At the time of my visits, in late December, many of the tables were filled with large family groups of Chinese, Indian and Thai diners, toting their wine and beer bottles (Jaiya had no liquor license). Aside from the addition of some Thai wall art, the basic, utilitarian dining room has neutral walls, a greenhouse effect on one end, a crystal chandelier at the entrance and white tablecloths.</p>

        <p>FIRE-EATERS and timid eaters, diners seeking exotica and those who prefer the familiar will be able to eat a satisfying meal of light Thai food at Jaiya. The new restaurant, which opened two months ago at 46 West Old Country Road in Hicksville (516-681-3400), is Long Island's largest Thai-based eating place, with 165 seats. It has a pedigree a quarter of a century old from New York City. Virachart and Wanne Pokpoonpipat, the owners, began with a restaurant in Queens and for the last decade have run one in Manhattan. Like the others, the local Jaiya (it means darling) offers terrific Thai food with some Indian and Chinese wild cards, at easy-to-take-prices.</p>
        <p>At the time of my visits, in late December, many of the tables were filled with large family groups of Chinese, Indian and Thai diners, toting their wine and beer bottles (Jaiya had no liquor license). Aside from the addition of some Thai wall art, the basic, utilitarian dining room has neutral walls, a greenhouse effect on one end, a crystal chandelier at the entrance and white tablecloths.</p>
        <p>What is served at those tables are not safe, mass-produced Chinese standards but the light, subtle food of Thailand, India and the Chow Chow region of China. It's prepared by Wanne Pokpoonpipat, the chef and co-owner. She is equally adept preparing popular favorites (mee krob and pad Thai) and less-known dishes (salted cabbage and ground pork soup, omelet stuffed with tomato sauce and ground pork).</p>
        <p>Those dishes are among the many excellent choices at Jaiya. The mee krob ($9.25) starter, with its brittle, crisp fried noodles coated with caramelized meat sauce, is hauntingly sweet perfection. Pad Thai ($10), listed as Thai-style noodles, comes with shrimp, chicken or beef and packs a subtle punch. The soothing salted cabbage and ground pork soup ($9) is one of many mild possibilities that prove Thai dishes need not be spicy to be tasty and interesting. Another is the unexpected omelet ($9.25) entree, an appealing Asian version of our western one.</p>
        <p>Appetizer prices seem disproportionately high compared with main courses because most starters, including all soups, feed three or more diners, although the menu makes no mention of their size.</p>
        <p>In Thailand, dishes usually arrive at the same time. That's not the practice at Jaiya, where staccato meal service was the norm. Invariably, the last dish to reach us was lukewarm. Family-style platters without serving spoons, servers talking on cellphones rather than watching tables and sweet, but clueless waitresses (did you get your soup?) caused further delays.</p>
        <p>Yet patrons with a sense of humor and adventure will forgive and forget when they experience the galaxy of aromas, textures and flavors in Ms. Pokpoonpipat's cooking.</p>
        <p>Spicy dishes can be ordered mild, medium or hot. The last should be chosen only by diners with asbestos-lined mouths. I opted for hot in a beef with chili and onion dish ($10.25) and it nearly blew my head off. Despite that, it would be a mistake to shun every spicy choice. Just choose medium, or if you're a culinary coward, mild.</p>
        <p>Although most Thai soups are mild or lemony, the No.1 pick here was the robust, full-of-vibrant-flavor, spicy shrimp or fish soup ($10.23). It came in a circular bowl with a volcano-like flame springing from its hollow center. Other starters that displayed kick but didn't obscure admirable flavor were naked shrimp ($10.50) and barbecued flank steak ($9.25) with a moderately spicy dipping sauce on the side. The firm, naked shrimp generated chili-driven heat but with a welcome citrus edge from their lemon juice. The steak was crusty, chewy and very tasty. The tails on the shrimp, in both the soup and the starter, must be pulled off by hand, making for rather messy eating.</p>
        <p>Less than inspiring appetizers were the tough, undistinguished Chinese sausages ($9.25) and the cold, iceberg lettuce-dominated crab-meat salad ($7). The Thai salad ($6.25), a joining of that lettuce, eggs, onions and cucumbers with a tangy, peanut-based dressing, was the best of the bunch.</p>
        <p>Among the many main dishes worth ordering were the mild, Indian chicken curry ($9.75) with plenty of onions; the jumbo shrimp ($11.25) on a bed of smooth glass noodles and bean sprouts; the black mushroom-studded beef ($10.25) alive with ginger sauce; and the Jaiya special fish ($19), a whole red snapper with a crisp, highly seasoned surface. Use the rice that accompanies most dishes as the Thais do, to cut the heat quotient in spicy preparations.</p>
        <p>Before departing, sample a cooling square of pumpkin custard ($3) infused with coconut, sweet fried bananas ($6) with a jasmine ice cream counter point or perhaps a scoop of exotic durian ice cream ($3) that tastes like over-ripe Roquefort cheese.</p>
        <p>Openings</p>
        <p>Off the Wall, a 75-seat continental restaurant, is scheduled to open next month at 67 Wall Street in Huntington (no phone yet) where Trio's and Joelle's had been. Cosmo Parrella and Luigi Aloe, the owners, who also own Munday's in downtown Huntington, indicated that their new venture would feature grilled fish, steaks and chops, game specials and pastas with all entrees priced below $20. Helmer Velasquez from Munday's and a second chef, yet to be named, will preside in the kitchen. The restaurant's name derives from its blackboard menus and its Wall Street location.</p>
