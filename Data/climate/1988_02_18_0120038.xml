        <p>LEAD: Uruguay's Foreign Minister, Enrique V. Iglesias, is expected to be elected president of the Inter-American Development Bank at a special meeting of its executive board Thursday, bank officials said today.</p>
        <p>Uruguay's Foreign Minister, Enrique V. Iglesias, is expected to be elected president of the Inter-American Development Bank at a special meeting of its executive board Thursday, bank officials said today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Iglesias is backed by most Latin American countries, as well as by Canada and West Germany. But selection of the 55-year-old former Uruguayan economics professor and central banker is unlikely to end a two-year dispute between Latin countries and the Reagan Administration over the bank's lending policies.</p>
        <p>Arguing that its conditions are too lax, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d has tried to increase United States control over the 44-nation institution, which lends as much as $3 billion annually to the Latin nations. Need for Fresh Capital</p>
        <p>Mr. Baker has linked the bank's need for fresh capital with a plan to give the United States, which is the bank's largest contributor, near-veto power over the bank's loans.</p>
        <p>Latin American nations rejected the proposal at the bank's annual meeting last March in Miami, and international officials said there were no signs of compromise. ''Both sides are dug in on this one,'' said a senior official of the bank. ''It will now be unfinished business for the next Administration.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Baker, who declined to vote either for or against Mr. Yglesias, has now told Latin officials not to expect the current Administration to ask Congress for a capital increase for the bank this year. Focus on World Bank</p>
        <p>In contrast, Mr. Baker is now seeking Congressional approval for a near-doubling of the capital of the World Bank, a much bigger development lender whose policies are more attuned to Administration thinking, and whose president, former Republican Representative Barber B. Conable Jr., was selected by Mr. Baker.</p>
        <p>Traditionally, the World Bank's president is from the United States. At the Inter-American Development Bank, which became a key instrument in the Alliance for Progress of the 1960's, the president is Latin American.</p>
        <p>Thursday's election was precipitated by the December resignation of Antonio Ortiz Mena, a former Mexican finance minister who had headed the bank for 17 years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ortiz Mena quit rather than accept a Reagan Administration appointee as his No. 2. Although Mr. Ortiz Mena said only that ''the moment has arrived for me to return to Mexico, particularly at this time,'' his departure was widely seen as an indication of the degree of Latin anger over American efforts to control the bank. Timed Announcement</p>
        <p>The announcement was timed to coincide with a going-away party at the Treasury cash room for James W. Conrow, the man tapped to be No. 2 at the bank. Mr. Conrow, Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary for developing nations, had served as Mr. Baker's point man in the conflict with the Latins. Mr. Conrow is still at the Treasury.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yglesias is expected to beat out the only other declared candidate for the presidency, Jaime Garcia-Parra, a former Colombian finance minister and now head of Paz del Rio, a big Colombian steel concern.</p>
        <p>The Uruguayan, who early in his career was a professor of economic development at the University of Montevideo and director of the university's Institute of Economics, has spent many years on the international scene.</p>
        <p>For most of the last decade he was executive secretary of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, one of the five regional economic commissions of the United Nations. Skilled Negotiator</p>
        <p>In 1981 he was secretary general of the United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Energy Sources held in Nairobi, Kenya.</p>
        <p>In 1986 he made friends among senior American trade officials because of his negotiating skills as chairman of the successful Punta del Este conference that started the Uruguay Round of international trade liberalization under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</p>
        <p>A successful conclusion of the round is now one of the principal international economic policy goals of the United States.</p>
