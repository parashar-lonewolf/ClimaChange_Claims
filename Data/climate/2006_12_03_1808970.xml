        <p>STAND on West Fulton Market in Chicago at around 3 p.m. and witness an incongruous changeover. Forklifts hauling greasy pallets of sliced bacon clear out, as bright young things in stiletto heels and luxury cars roll in.</p>
        <p>This is Chicago's meatpacking district, just west of the Loop and known as the West Loop. And like its sister in New York City, the gritty, blood-soaked and sometimes rancid-smelling neighborhood is undergoing a major transformation.</p>
        <p>''We've got 100-year-old businesses selling wholesale pork rinds and bulk-size canned tomatoes next to world-class galleries selling $50,000 paintings,'' said Eric Sedler, president of the West Loop community organization. ''That's what makes this neighborhood so appealing -- it's not overly planned or fabricated. It's been growing in this organic, evolutionary way for 12, 15 years now.''</p>
        <p>The latest wave started along West Randolph Street, an industrial strip where trend-setting restaurants like Blackbird and Marché opened. But now it's pushing north, to the 19th-century warehouses, cold meat lockers and loading docks along West Fulton Market and West Lake Street.</p>
        <p>Among the pioneers is the Fulton Lounge (955 West Fulton Market, 312-942-9500, www.fultonlounge.com), a sophisticated bar and lounge with 15-foot ceilings, exposed brick walls and shag rugs. What was once a desolate street corner now bustles with parking valets and stylish young people in big sunglasses.</p>
        <p>A few doors down is Moto restaurant (945 West Fulton Market, 312-491-0058, www.motorestaurant.com), where the mad scientist-chef Homaro Cantu, a Charlie Trotter protégé, creates ''postmodern'' food using liquid nitrogen, carbon dioxide and lasers. The chili cheese nachos, for example, taste like a fruit salad, and the menu is printed on edible, panini-flavored paper (five-course tasting menu, $70).</p>
        <p>On Lake Street, boutiques and galleries are sprouting under the elevated train tracks that stripe the asphalt with shadows. Every few minutes, a train thunders past, but the fashionable newcomers don't seem to mind, not with the cheap rents.</p>
        <p>''For what we pay for this entire building, we would have gotten a tiny space in a more established district like River North,'' said Ryan Schulz, co-director of the NavtaSchulz Gallery, a new space that shows the work of emerging and established artists (1039 West Lake Street, 312-421-5506, on the Web at www.navtaschulzgallery.com).</p>
        <p>Some two dozen galleries now call the West Loop home, creating a thriving art market among the meat and produce purveyors. Among the newest are Kasia Kay Art Projects (1044 West Fulton Market, 312-492-8828, www.kasiakayartprojects.com), which showcases multimedia works, and Fifty50 Gallery (1017 West Lake Street, 312-243-3550, www.fifty50gallery.com), run by a local art student and his wife, an anthropologist.</p>
        <p>Down the street is Koros Art + Style (1019 West Lake Street, 312-738-0155, www.korosartandstyle.com), a boutique-cum-gallery in a soaring, brick-walled space that feels like a residential loft, thanks to the wrought-iron chandeliers, antique armoires and framed work by local artists. Try on organic cotton jeans by Loomstate ($174), while salespeople bring you champagne and a robe for the dressing room.</p>
        <p>After dark, ignore everything your mother ever told you about dark alleys and venture down North Sangamon Street toward the Victor Hotel (311 North Sangamon Street, 312-733-6900, on the Web at www.victorhotelchicago.com). It's not a hotel, but a former sausage factory that's been turned into a trendy restaurant and lounge.</p>
        <p>''People pass by and think we're a fleabag hotel,'' said a co-owner, Jerry Kleiner, one of Chicago's most celebrated restaurateurs. Grinning broadly, he gestured out the front door to the deserted street and the boarded-up warehouses. ''I love the mystery, the suspense, the illusion of seediness. You couldn't paint a better backdrop.''</p>
