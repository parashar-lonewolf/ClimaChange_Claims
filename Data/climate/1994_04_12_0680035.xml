        <p>The nation's teetering system of weather satellites, for years held together by luck and borrowed equipment, hopes to receive new vitality on Wednesday with the launching of the most advanced weather sentinel ever placed above Earth.</p>
        <p>The satellite, the first of a planned series of five that are to be the eyes of weather forecasters into the next century, is an ambitious attempt to create a new generation of instruments for predicting weather and averting natural disasters.</p>
        <p>The spacecraft is also a chance for NASA and the country's weather service agencies to prove that the vital program is back on track after an embarrassing period of miscalculations and foul-ups that put it years behind schedule and far over budget.  Program managers hope its launching, if successful, together with last year's orbital repair of the Hubble Space Telescope, will restore the agencies' credibility after a series of space failures and assure the public that expensive, high-technology projects can pay off.</p>
        <p>"We need this satellite," said Thomas E. McGunigal, program manager for the project with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Commerce Department agency that owns and operates the weather satellite system. "We need to get it up, we need to operate it, we need to show people what it can do."</p>
        <p>Arthur F. Obenschain, the project manager for NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., which is overseeing construction of the satellites, said engineers have overcome all major technical problems that previously plagued the program. "All of the major components are within specification and we have confidence in them," he said.</p>
        <p>The first of the next generation of spacecraft in the GOES series, an acronym for Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite, is scheduled to be launched on Wednesday from Cape Canaveral, Fla., aboard an Atlas rocket.</p>
        <p>The new weather satellites have a radically different design from their predecessors. They combine improved instruments for more detailed images and more precise scientific readings with a new way of stabilizing the spacecraft so that its eyes always stare down at Earth.</p>
        <p>GOES satellites orbit Earth 22,340 miles high at positions above the Equator. From this vantage point, the satellites' orbits match the rotation of Earth, allowing them to hover over the same position.</p>
        <p>Earlier GOES satellites were spun constantly to keep them stable, requiring special cameras that scanned the planet in small segments while looking out into space 90 percent of the time, Mr. McGunigal said. The new generation maintains a steady position using a system of spinning momentum wheels, gyroscopes and small rockets. This allows uninterrupted observations and, for the first time, the ability to focus on particular storms, tornado systems and other weather spots of interest.</p>
        <p>A second major innovation is greatly improved instrumentation for taking pictures of weather patterns and for measuring the heat and humidity of the atmosphere at various heights.  The two major instruments aboard the craft, called the imager and the sounder, have been significantly improved over previous versions, and can be operated simultaneously to provide better, more in-depth information, engineers said. On earlier GOES satellites, the instruments shared certain components that required them to be used one at a time.</p>
        <p>The sounder monitors the infrared radiation reaching the satellite from Earth's atmosphere, using this information for making heat and humidity profiles at different altitudes that give meteorologists an intimate picture of what is going on in the air below. Instead of relying on cloud patterns alone to tell them that a storm is brewing or to predict the path of a disturbance, researchers say a sounder can probe clear sky for a harvest of clues on incipient weather conditions. Discovery in 1980's</p>
        <p>Scientists discovered in the early 1980's, when the first experimental sounders were tested, that measuring different wavelengths of infrared radiation through a column of air gave them temperature and humidity readings at different levels. Different wavelengths indicate the presence and temperature of water vapor, carbon dioxide and other gases, as well as their altitude.</p>
        <p>But scientists also realized that this information signaled different atmospheric densities, which nature always tries to balance by moving air from one place to the next. Armed with these data, they learned to deduce the speed and direction of wind currents in clear air and were able to produce valuable maps of global wind flow.</p>
        <p>The sounder on the new spacecraft has been greatly improved over previous versions, examining the atmosphere through 19 infrared wavelengths instead of 12 to retrieve more and better information through different layers of air, Mr. McGunigal said. Since this instrument works best when looking through clear air, it should help forecasters better chart the invisible winds that help determine the paths of hurricanes and tornadoes.</p>
        <p>To produce pictures with better sharpness, contrast and brightness, the new imaging camera is more sensitive and simultaneously picks up more visible and infrared wavelengths of light than its predecessors.</p>
        <p>GOES-8's camera will form images much faster and get more detail about weather trouble spots. It can be programmed to look at a particular storm system every five minutes, and create an image of the contiguous 48 states every 15 minutes, compared with the hour needed by current satellites. The more frequent data updates should improve forecasters' ability to track changes in the intensity and paths of storms. Specifically, forecasters should be able to narrow the zone within which a hurricane is expected to hit land.</p>
        <p>The new GOES satellite is larger and more than four times heavier than the earlier generation craft because of its new stabilization system, improved instruments and greater communications ability with the ground. The main instruments aboard the satellite, which weighs 4,640 pounds, are housed in a seven-foot-square cube from which two long booms extend. A single-wing, two-panel solar power array extends 20 feet from one end of the spacecraft while a 10-foot cone-shaped solar sail is mounted on a 58-foot boom protruding from the other side. The sail helps stabilize the craft by balancing the pressure exerted by constant solar radiation. Failure of Satellite</p>
        <p>The United States usually maintains two weather satellites in geostationary orbits, one each over the East and West Coasts, and supplements their images and readings with data from lower-altitude satellites that circle the planet above its poles. The system began breaking down in 1989 when GOES-6 failed shortly after it reached its planned five-year life span, leaving only GOES-7, orbited in 1987, operating. A previously planned replacement satellite blew up in a launching accident in 1986. As a temporary measure, the United States last year borrowed an aging spare European satellite, Meteosat-3.</p>
        <p>The program to develop new GOES satellites, an effort begun in 1985 and dubbed GOES-NEXT, is at least three years behind schedule. Critics attribute the delay to unexpected problems in developing its instruments, and poor quality control in manufacturing and testing components. Some experts estimate that the cost of building and launching five of the new satellites by the year 2005, as planned, will total almost $2 billion, more than triple original estimates.</p>
        <p>Blame fell on Ford Aerospace, then the prime contractor, and the I.T.T. Corporation's aerospace division, a major subcontractor. In addition, NASA was faulted by Congressional critics and others for not tightly managing the program and inadequately testing system components. In 1990, the Loral Corporation bought Ford Aerospace and Loral's Space Systems group took over the troubled program and set about correcting the deficiencies. A Costly Mistake</p>
        <p>Dr. Elbert W. Friday Jr., director of the National Weather Service, said the project got into trouble because weather service agencies were persuaded by scientists not to be too conservative in designing the new system.</p>
        <p>"In retrospect, we probably should have been more hesitant at stepping out so far" into new technology, Dr. Friday said. "We had problems in manufacturing specific parts for the satellites and also pushed the state of the art of some of the sensors far past what people thought that state was."</p>
        <p>But Dr. Friday said he was now optimistic about the new series of satellites. "We have carried out testing to the extent we never had before," he said. "I am now happy with the performance I see."</p>
