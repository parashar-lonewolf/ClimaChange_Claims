        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>" 'Emperors of Garbage' " (Op-Ed, Nov. 5) suggests that exotic or disastrous events provide convenient case material to pronounce on what's good or bad for India. But why should a few claim only they see, smell or care about the problem? To proceed so would miss the efforts of those working to improve the human condition in India.</p>
        <p>The Indian Government effectively thwarted the threat of the spread of the plague in the country, and sufficient domestically produced Tetracycline and other antibiotics were available to treat the victims, thus preventing the possibility of an epidemic. Considering the density of human population in Indian cities and the biological mechanisms by which the plague is transmitted, this was no mean achievement.</p>
        <p>Foreign companies doing business in India's changed economic climate have stressed that the real story in India is one of tremendous business and investment opportunities.</p>
        <p>Comprehending the hopes, goals and complexities of a modernizing, developing country of almost 900 million is no easy task. Diatribes about garbage and filth do not clarify the situation. NIRUPAMA RAO Minister, Press, Information and Culture, Embassy of India Washington, Nov. 9, 1994</p>
