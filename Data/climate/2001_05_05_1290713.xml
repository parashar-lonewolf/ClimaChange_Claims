        <p>The Bush administration's energy policy, centered primarily on increasing the supply of oil, coal and nuclear power, is shortsighted and misaimed, focusing too much on the wrong fuels and too firmly on supply.</p>
        <p>There is no question that we need to reduce our dependency on foreign oil. Energy companies now enjoying record profits should use their newly minted resources to pursue additional exploration and to build desperately needed refining capacity. But drilling for oil need not be conducted in environmentally sensitive areas. And since oil is not a major fuel for power plants, finding more of it will do little to address an issue that demands immediate attention: providing for our growing needs for electricity.</p>
        <p>Coal is an abundant energy source. But it should not be the fuel of choice for power plants, either, as President Bush signaled it would be when he rescinded a campaign pledge to regulate carbon dioxide emissions. Vice President Dick Cheney said last week that coal would be a primary source of power generation for years to come.</p>
        <p>We are likely to need 1,000 new power plants by 2020. It is preferable that they be clean, efficient, gas-fired plants that emit few pollutants. Technological investment and changes in plants to increase energy efficiency will be curtailed if we continue on an exclusively pro-coal path.</p>
        <p>Despite current capacity and price problems, clean-burning natural gas should be recognized as America's best source of energy for supplying electricity in the future. Meeting the nation's generation demands will require that we not only find and produce 60 percent more natural gas, but deliver it to markets. We need to be aggressive in the construction of 30,000 miles of new gas transmission lines and 275,000 miles of new distribution lines. All Americans should support construction of the proposed transcontinental natural gas pipeline, following the most economical route from Alaska's North Slope to the lower 48 states.</p>
        <p>As for nuclear power, we have not yet resolved the intractable problem of where to store the thousands of metric tons of nuclear waste scattered across the country. False expectations should not be raised. We cannot build new power plants before we decide whether Yucca Mountain in Nevada is scientifically and environmentally suitable as a long-term depository. The contentious debate on its suitability should be made on the basis of science and not politics.</p>
        <p>But no matter what the fuels, supply is only one element of energy policy. And because it takes a long time to develop new sources or build new infrastructure, the supply side is necessarily the longer-term part of our planning. Energy efficiency -- investments in developing and deploying technology to increase the efficient use of our scarce energy resources -- is our best bet for meeting the nation's shorter-term energy needs.</p>
        <p>Last week's speech by Vice President Cheney cleverly showered energy efficiency and conservation solutions with faint praise. With the federal government the biggest energy consumer, the administration is right to cut its own energy consumption, if only by repeating the guidelines given last year. But much more can and must be done.</p>
        <p>Increasing the efficiency of our vehicle fleet by just three miles a  gallon would save us one million barrels of oil per day, out of the roughly 10 million barrels we import. Regrettably, Mr. Bush reduced the Energy Department's budget for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs by 30 percent. A partnership with automakers to increase mileage in vehicles to 80 miles a gallon was also significantly cut. The Bush Energy Department also caved in to the air conditioning industry to block a rule requiring residential central air conditioners to be more efficient.</p>
        <p>It is important to the nation's future that we take a bipartisan and balanced approach to energy policy. Everyone needs to recognize that energy and environmental policy are two sides of the same coin. Perhaps most important, we need to emphasize supply and demand in equal measure. In the end, this balance will be the true recipe for success.</p>
