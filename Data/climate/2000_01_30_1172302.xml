        <p>And Bear in Mind  (Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>AFTERBURN, by Colin Harrison. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $25.) Elegant prose and exact description keep this thriller flying with an overload of unlikely characters (the heroine is a mathematical genius jailed for hijacking trucks).</p>
        <p>BETWEEN FATHER AND SON: Family Letters, by V. S. Naipaul. (Knopf, $26.) An entertaining correspondence that shows the young author's vulnerability and mirrors themes of the South Asian diaspora that will appear in his fiction; sagely edited by his agent, Gillon Aitken.</p>
        <p>FASTING, FEASTING, by Anita Desai. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, paper, $13.) This wry and moving novel employs, of all things, choices about eating as rituals used to form allegiances and exert household power in India and America.</p>
        <p>GEORGIANA: Duchess of Devonshire, by Amanda Foreman. (Random House, $29.95.) The life is seamlessly merged with the times in this biography of a smart, charming woman who practiced power politics and scandalous domestic arrangements in the later 18th century.</p>
        <p>THE HOUSE OF ROTHSCHILD: The World's Banker, 1849-1999, by Niall Ferguson. (Viking, $34.95.) This second volume of an absorbing family saga about a clan matchless in the annals of moneymaking has all the grandeur and sweep of a Victorian three-decker novel.</p>
        <p>IN LOVE WITH NIGHT: The American Romance With Robert Kennedy, by Ronald Steel. (Simon &amp; Schuster, $23.) Beneath the good (liberal, compassionate) Bobby, Steel argues in this book-length revisionist essay, there was a darker Bobby (cynical, opportunistic and, above all, ruthless).</p>
        <p>ON THE REZ, by Ian Frazier. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $25.) Close observation and a keen sense for piquant juxtapositions yield an enlarged view of humanity in this report from a region that has inspired acres of cliche and condescension in the past, the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota.</p>
        <p>PARTISANS: Marriage, Politics, and Betrayal Among the New York Intellectuals, by David Laskin. (Simon &amp; Schuster, $26.) A shapely guide to the intersections and overlaps of love and career among the great pre-feminist eggheads.</p>
        <p>SEEING THROUGH PLACES: Reflections on Geography and Identity, by Mary Gordon. (Scribner, $23.) Eight essays about places she inhabited that illuminate the author's fiction, including a guilt-ridden household and an oppressive but grandly historical church.</p>
        <p>TRAPPINGS: New Poems, by Richard Howard. (Turtle Point, paper, $14.95.) Howard's 11th book of poems holds up language for examination in the strangeness of its uses while constructing a humane, inclusive, theatrical vision of the world.</p>

        <p>And Bear in Mind  (Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>AFTERBURN, by Colin Harrison. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $25.) Elegant prose and exact description keep this thriller flying with an overload of unlikely characters (the heroine is a mathematical genius jailed for hijacking trucks).</p>
        <p>BETWEEN FATHER AND SON: Family Letters, by V. S. Naipaul. (Knopf, $26.) An entertaining correspondence that shows the young author's vulnerability and mirrors themes of the South Asian diaspora that will appear in his fiction; sagely edited by his agent, Gillon Aitken.</p>
        <p>FASTING, FEASTING, by Anita Desai. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, paper, $13.) This wry and moving novel employs, of all things, choices about eating as rituals used to form allegiances and exert household power in India and America.</p>
        <p>GEORGIANA: Duchess of Devonshire, by Amanda Foreman. (Random House, $29.95.) The life is seamlessly merged with the times in this biography of a smart, charming woman who practiced power politics and scandalous domestic arrangements in the later 18th century.</p>
        <p>THE HOUSE OF ROTHSCHILD: The World's Banker, 1849-1999, by Niall Ferguson. (Viking, $34.95.) This second volume of an absorbing family saga about a clan matchless in the annals of moneymaking has all the grandeur and sweep of a Victorian three-decker novel.</p>
        <p>IN LOVE WITH NIGHT: The American Romance With Robert Kennedy, by Ronald Steel. (Simon &amp; Schuster, $23.) Beneath the good (liberal, compassionate) Bobby, Steel argues in this book-length revisionist essay, there was a darker Bobby (cynical, opportunistic and, above all, ruthless).</p>
        <p>ON THE REZ, by Ian Frazier. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $25.) Close observation and a keen sense for piquant juxtapositions yield an enlarged view of humanity in this report from a region that has inspired acres of cliche and condescension in the past, the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota.</p>
        <p>PARTISANS: Marriage, Politics, and Betrayal Among the New York Intellectuals, by David Laskin. (Simon &amp; Schuster, $26.) A shapely guide to the intersections and overlaps of love and career among the great pre-feminist eggheads.</p>
        <p>SEEING THROUGH PLACES: Reflections on Geography and Identity, by Mary Gordon. (Scribner, $23.) Eight essays about places she inhabited that illuminate the author's fiction, including a guilt-ridden household and an oppressive but grandly historical church.</p>
        <p>TRAPPINGS: New Poems, by Richard Howard. (Turtle Point, paper, $14.95.) Howard's 11th book of poems holds up language for examination in the strangeness of its uses while constructing a humane, inclusive, theatrical vision of the world.</p>
