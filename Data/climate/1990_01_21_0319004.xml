        <p>LEAD: While efforts to restore clean air to the United States have met with partial success, there is a far greater ecological disaster brewing in Eastern Europe, a report on worldwide air pollution said today.</p>
        <p>While efforts to restore clean air to the United States have met with partial success, there is a far greater ecological disaster brewing in Eastern Europe, a report on worldwide air pollution said today.</p>
        <p>The report, issued by the Worldwatch Institute, a Washington-based environmental group, warned that gains in the West are quickly being negated by the unrestricted burning of high-sulfur brown coal and diesel fuel that is blackening cities across Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>''Fishless lakes and streams, dying forests, and faceless ancient sculptures all provide sad testimony to the destruction that industrialization has wrought,'' wrote Hilary F. French, a researcher at the Worldwatch Institute and author of the report, ''Clearing the Air: A Global Agenda.'' The notion that ''pollution is the price of progress'' has become antiquated, she said.</p>
        <p>Hasty industrialization in the East after World War II, powered by the region's abundance of brown coal, has resulted in air quality reminiscent of London at its Dickensian worst, Ms. French wrote.</p>
        <p>The city of Olkosz, Poland, reports one of the highest levels of lead and cadmium in the soil in the world, the report said, and acid rain has turned the panoramic mountains along the East German and Czechoslovakian border into a vast expanse of dead trees.</p>
        <p>''The lack of market forces kept these countries from realizing the impressive gains in energy efficiency registered in the West after the oil shocks of the Seventies, and their weak economies still preclude major investments in pollution control,'' the report said.</p>
        <p>Richard Mott, director of the atmospheric-pollution program at the Environmental Law Institute in Washington, agreed that air pollution in Eastern Europe is some of the worst in the world. The problem is the price of fixing it.</p>
        <p>''The technologies are extremely expensive even by Western standards,'' Mr. Mott said in a recent interview. ''It's a technological luxury we've been able to afford. It's not realistic to think those technologies are going to spring up in the East themselves, despite the enormous need for them there.''</p>
        <p>To begin tackling pollution in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, these countries will need Western know-how as well as domestic reform, the report said. ''Now that air pollution and its damaging health and ecological effects have proliferated around the globe, crossing borders with winds, international cooperation is critical,'' it said. ''Nations that receive the bulk of their pollution from other countries have an obvious interest in sharing and financing the technical means to reduce that pollution.''</p>
        <p>While the United States has been slow to deal with air pollution on a global scale, European nations have begun to help their neighbors in the East with pollution-control devices.</p>
        <p>The report said West Germany is donating $163 million to East Germany for pollution control. Sweden announced it is spending $45 million in Poland over the next three years, mostly to cut airborne pollutants.</p>
        <p>Increasing pressure on Eastern countries to improve their air should not hinder domestic reform, argued C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington. Any investment will create jobs and orders for new products, and it can just as well be for environmentally safe ends, he added.</p>
        <p>''If you do it right, you can simultanously pursue environmental and economic objectives,'' Mr. Bergsten said. ''Starting from scratch makes it even easier to accomplish environmentally sound objectives.''</p>
        <p>Not a Simple Switch</p>
        <p>Ms. French warned that Western industrial countries must not simply transfer their pollution-control methods to the East and the third world. She argued that the ''technological Band-Aids prescribed by the regulatory intervention'' cannot deliver their promises of clean air.</p>
        <p>Instead, she said, traditional efforts need to be supported by policies that encourage energy efficiency and develop alternative sources that spew out fewer toxic wastes.</p>
