        <p>Symbiosis à Trois</p>
        <p>Olavius algarvensis is a gutless creature.</p>
        <p>Harsh words but true: O. algarvensis, an inch-long tube worm that spends its days buried in the sandy bottom of the Mediterranean, has no gut. Instead, it has two types of symbiotic bacteria living in its tissues that help to provide it with nutrients.</p>
        <p>Normally, two symbiotic species would be bad for a host, because they would compete for space and resources. Unless, of course, the symbionts did not actually compete but benefited from each other as well as the host.</p>
        <p>German and Swedish researchers, writing in the journal Nature, say that such a symbiosis à trois is just what is going on in O. algarvensis. Rather than competing, the two types of bacteria have a mutually beneficial relationship -- they recycle sulfur compounds between them, in the process providing the worm with organic carbon and consuming some of the products of its metabolism.</p>
        <p>Bacterium No. 1 reduces sulfates (by adding electrons, from hydrogen or another source), producing hydrogen sulfide. Bacterium No. 2 takes the sulfide and oxidizes it (using oxygen from the water as an electron acceptor), producing sulfates to be used by No. 1. No. 2 fixes carbon dioxide and produces organic carbon compounds for use by the worm.</p>
        <p>The sulfide-oxidizing bacteria can also get sulfide from sediments. But the fact that the oxidizing bacteria also have an internal source of sulfide from their symbionts means that they are not dependent on an external supply. This may enable the worm to colonize habitats where sediments are sulfide-poor.</p>
        <p>Early Birds and Worms</p>
        <p>Much discussion of global warming focuses, naturally, on its global effects -- rising sea levels or the large-scale effect on plants and animals. But long-term warming can have micro results as well. A case in point is in the current issue of Nature, where Dutch researchers report on how a long-distance migratory bird responds to climate change.</p>
        <p>The researchers studied pied flycatchers that winter in West Africa and return to woodlands in Holland each spring. Mean temperatures in the spring territory have increased several degrees over two decades. Higher spring temperatures mean that insects, the birds' food, reach their peak abundance earlier. That means birds that hatch earlier get more food. (The early bird, it turns out, gets the fly as well as the worm.)</p>
        <p>The researchers found that over the two decades, the pied flycatcher's mean laying date has advanced by a little more than a week, as selection has favored earlier laying. But it has not been enough, and the problem lies in the time that the birds migrate. That has not changed, the researchers say, because the birds' decision to leave their winter quarters is related to the amount of daylight, which is not affected by warming.</p>
        <p>So the birds are arriving at the same time and laying eggs earlier. But this is not keeping pace with the advancing spring. The researchers suggest that this phenomenon may be contributing to declines of other long-distance migrants.</p>
        <p>Testing Fish in a Flash</p>
        <p>Mercury contamination in fish can be a threat to human health, causing birth defects and other serious problems. Testing fish for mercury, however, is a complicated process done in a laboratory.</p>
        <p>Scientists at the Scripps Research Institute in California have now come up with a simpler testing method that can be done in the field.</p>
        <p>It requires only a small sample of fish tissue placed in an enzyme.  Once the tissue is broken down, a stick coated with a resin-containing compound that binds with the mercury is dipped into the solution. The mercury is then removed from the resin by dipping the stick in an acid solution, and the amount of mercury can be determined.</p>
        <p>Perhaps some day the method may even be used by anglers to see if the fish caught in the morning is safe to eat that night.</p>
