        <p>Legislators from the United States, Europe and Japan announced plans today to introduce parallel legislation to deal with climate change, deforestation and other threats to the environment.</p>
        <p>The legislators, members of Global Legislators Organization for a Balanced Environment, or Globe, said at a news conference here today that tough environmental legislation would be introduced into the United States Congress, the Japanese Parliament and the European Parliament. They also said they expected their initiatives to put pressure on national governments to act more decisively on threats to global ecological systems.</p>
        <p>Representative James H. Scheuer, Democrat of New York and founder and outgoing president of Globe, said that the two-year-old group was "coordinating environmental initiatives and providing common standards" to governments around the world. Less Energy Consumption</p>
        <p>At the end of their three-day meeting, the legislators agreed to back laws aimed at mitigating global warming by reducing energy consumption in their respective countries. Scientists believe the earth's surface will warm by 3 degrees Fahrenheit or more by the middle of the next century, as carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels along with other industrial gases accumulate in the atmosphere and retain heat radiated from the sun.</p>
        <p>The legislation would stress reducing dependence on fossil fuels through conservation and through developing technologies that rely on other energy sources.</p>
        <p>They also said they would try to enact legislation for protecting rapidly disappearing tropical forests. Their proposed law would require their Governments to enter negotiations on an international timber agreement. Such an accord would reduce timber cutting, improve economic returns to the the tropical countries and encourage the sustainable uses of the forests.  Help for Malaysian State</p>
        <p>The legislators urged an 80 percent reduction in cutting in the Malaysian state of Sarawak, where, according to Hemmo Muntingh, a member of the European Parliament from the Netherlands, unrestrained logging has created a desperate situation that approached "ecological suicide" for much of Sarawak. The legislators called for a moratorium on log imports from Sarawak by the industrial nations.</p>
        <p>An official in the Malaysian Embassy here said logging in Sarawak had already been reduced. The official, who would not give his name, said he would not comment on any of the other statements made by the legislators at today's news conference.</p>
        <p>They also called on the United States, Canada, Japan, and the Soviet Union to draw up a treaty for protecting the ecology of the North Pacific where, they said, marine mammals, fish, and sea bird populations were being reduced very rapdily because of excessive harvesting and pollution.</p>
        <p>Senator Albert Gore Jr., the Tennessee Democrat who is Globe's new president, said: "Whether presidents or prime ministers act in these areas or not, parliamentarians will act. The people of the world want the environment to be protected and parliaments, by their nature, are closer to the grass roots." Praises From Japan</p>
        <p>Takashi Kosugi, a representative of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in Japan, said that the common positions taken by Globe had helped overcome resistance to environmental protection measures by the Trade and Finance Ministries of his Government.</p>
        <p>The legislators agreed on a letter to Maurice Strong, the Secretary General of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, to be held in Brazil in 1992, urging that the conference take up as a primary issue "the burgeoning human population growth in the developing world." Unsustainable population growth, the letter said, threatens "public and private programs to improve health, combat poverty, raise education levels and improve the environment."</p>
        <p>The June 1992 conference, to be held in Rio de Janeiro, is expected to play a critical role in developing global programs for protecting the environment while promoting economic growth, particularly in the poorer nations of Latin America, Africa and Asia.</p>
