        <p>COULD foreign debt be the lever that moves poor countries to save their rain forests? President Bush apparently thinks so. The White House is backing a bold program to channel billions of dollars that Latin American governments owe Washington into local conservation projects.</p>
        <p>"Debt for nature" swaps are not new. Private groups are already busy raising cash to buy up foreign debt, trading the I.O.U.'s back to the financially troubled debtors in return for commitments to acquire parks and conserve environmental resources in eight countries.</p>
        <p>What is new is the possible addition of vast quantities of Government money to the pot -- and the prospect of a systematic, well-financed defense of tropical forests that serve as a natural sink for greenhouse gases and shelter the lion's share of the world's plant and animal species.</p>
        <p>William Reilly, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the program's most influential champion, believes that a successful reshuffling of some $12 billion in foreign aid loans by the United States would mobilize $100 million a year for conservation projects. The approach could also serve as a model for European and Japanese governments, which carry another $38 billion in Latin American debt.</p>
        <p>No less important is that the plan requires the participation of local environmentalists, who have often been excluded from decision-making. John Sawhill, the head of the Nature Conservancy, an active promoter of debt-for-nature swaps, argues that the resulting public-private partnerships could tilt local interests in favor of environmental protection.</p>
        <p>The big question now is whether Washington, preoccupied by war in the Persian Gulf and recession at home, is sufficiently committed to the swap idea to plow through the political and financial obstacles. Much depends on the Administration's flexibility in determining which Latin debtors are eligible. For its part, Congress will either have to allow some creative accounting on the debt shuffle or will have to add new foreign aid money to the budget.</p>
        <p>Thomas Lovejoy, an ecologist now at the Smithsonian Institution, dreamed up the idea of linking foreign debt relief to the financing of environmental projects in debtor nations in 1984. At the time, crushing foreign debts had led most poor countries to cut back on environmental protection. Why not wipe out part of the debts denominated in dollars and yen for commitments to spend cruzeiros and pesos on conservation?</p>
        <p>But it was private organizations, not governments or commercial banks, that turned theory into practice. In the very first swap in 1987, Conservation International, an American group, paid $100,000 for an uncollectible $650,000 that Bolivia owed to Citicorp . The group then agreed to wipe out Bolivia's $650,000 debt in return for its promise to protect a 3.7-million-acre buffer around the Beni Biosphere Reserve and to spend the equivalent of $250,000 in local currency to manage the reserve. Since then, 14 other debt-for-nature swaps have been carried out, reducing external debts and protecting forests in Ecuador, Costa Rica, the Philippines, Madagascar, Zambia, the Dominican Republic and Poland.</p>
        <p>Clever financing arrangements, along with the enthusiastic cooperation of environmentally sensitive governments, have magnified the effects of the $16 million investment far beyond initial expectations. But as Mr. Sawhill of the Nature Conservancy points out, dependence on charitable donations has limited the overall impact on the global environment to "peanuts." That is why environmental groups, led by the World Wildlife Fund in Washington, worked hard to make a case for Federal intervention.</p>
        <p>They struck pay dirt last June when Mr. Bush included debt-for-nature swaps in his "Enterprise for the Americas" initiative, a broad effort to pare debt, liberalize trade and stimulate investment in Latin America and the Caribbean. In October, Congress authorized swaps for some $1.7 billion in debts incurred in the sales of subsidized food. The President is expected to ask that the swaps be extended to loans made by the United States Agency for International Development, as well as Export-Import Bank and Commodity Credit Corporation loans originally used to subsidize United States exports.</p>
        <p>To be eligible, debtor countries will have to pass muster on a number of criteria -- what one environmental lobbyist calls the "flaming hoops." They must be actively working to make deals with their other big creditors, in particular the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the commercial banks. And they must open their borders to foreign investors on reasonable terms.</p>
        <p>The carrot is substantial debt relief. The Administration is targeting a 50 percent write-off. Payments forgiven by the United States Treasury would be converted to local currencies and deposited in a national environmental funds.</p>
        <p>The money could be used for anything from conservation training to restoration of the world's oceans and atmosphere. But outlays would be planned and supervised by boards that included private citizens nominated by the United States Government.</p>
        <p>Many a slip is still possible. While environmental interests played a major role in passing the legislation, "different people in the Administration have different priorities," Mr. Sawhill noted.</p>
        <p>Jamaica, Chile, Bolivia and Costa Rica all reportedly have advocates in the Administration, and will probably be the first to cut Enterprise for the Americas deals. But if the United States takes a hard line on debt arrears or foreign investment rules, environmentally critical countries like Brazil and Peru will not qualify anytime soon.  Possible Inflationary Effects</p>
        <p>Another worry is the host nations' receptivity. Debt-for-nature swaps on a large scale will require countries to reorder economic priorities. Unless governments cut back on other spending when they agree to spend more on the environment, the arrangement will be inflationary.</p>
        <p>Outright rejection of swaps as an impingement on sovereignty, the position taken by Brazil's former President, Jose Sarney, is no longer fashionable in Latin America. Indeed, Latin American politicians seem more inclined to follow the lead of Costa Rica, which has touted debt-for-nature as a way to sustain jobs in tourism and develop agricultural techniques that will allow sustainable development.</p>
        <p>It is still not clear, though, whether elected officials will buy the idea of independent boards, which could compete with established interests. "Will they really allow anybody outside the government to have guaranteed funding?" asked Lamond Godwin, a vice president at the American Express Bank who has served as an adviser on a number of private debt swaps.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most serious obstacle to swaps is the issue of how they will be treated in the Federal budget. The Administration expects to to arrange deals that maintain the level of payments to Washington that would otherwise be expected.  Issue of Budget Accounting</p>
        <p>Debtor countries would come out ahead, since they would no longer need to reschedule unpaid debts each year and would be able to liquidate their debts in a reasonable time frame. But since there would be no real loss of income to Washington, the Administration contends that there ought to be no effect on budget accounting.</p>
        <p>If, for example, a country is now paying $1 million in principle plus $4 million in interest each year on an $80 million debt, it would go on writing annual checks to the United States Treasury for $5 million. But all the $5 million would be declared repayment of principle, allowing a far faster liquidation of the debt balance. The $4 million annual interest, converted to local currency, would go into the national environment fund.</p>
        <p>This socially redeeming sleight-of-hand does not, however, sit well with the professionals who keep the books for Congress. Some want the Treasury to treat debt reduction the way a private creditor would write off a bad loan, taking a loss in the year the deal is signed. Congress would be obliged to appropriate funds to cover the paper loss, adding to the budget deficit.</p>
        <p>That is not a problem in principle: if debt-for-nature swaps are worth doing, the logic goes, they are worth paying for. But as a practical matter it would probably torpedo large-scale swaps. "If there is a single budget item less popular than foreign assistance," said one senior Administration official, "I'm not aware of it." Causes for Optimism</p>
        <p>Environmental groups are nonetheless optimistic. Many of their leaders believe that Mr. Bush is committed to their cause and is eager to offset his image as a proscrastinator on the problem of global warming. Moreover, there is no serious opposition to debt-for-nature swaps in Congress, and there probably will not be unless the plan runs afoul of the budget process.</p>
        <p>Once off the ground, they believe, the initiatives will be imitated in Europe and Japan. Debt-for-nature provisions could also be routinely integrated into the rescheduling of hundreds of billions of dollars in debts owed to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. If the optimists are right, the only practical limit on their scale will be good ideas for making conservation compatible with economic development. Alchemy of a Debt-for-Nature Swap In March 1990, the Development Trust of Puerto Rico, a charity, spent $116,400 to buy $582,000 worth of the outstanding debt of the Dominican Republic, owed to the Swiss Bank Corp-oration. The trust then donated the right to collect the debt to the Nature Conservancy in Washington The Nature Conservancy then swapped this asset to the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic for $581,000 worth of local-currency bonds. These bonds, paying 12 percent interest, are held bythe Pronatura Fund, a consortium of Dominican conservatioon groups. The interest and principle support four projects, including a national park with the world's largest population of crocodiles. Source: The Nature Conservancy</p>
