        <p>''Hey, hey, hey, hey, wake up, sleepyheads! It's Morning in America! Saturday Morning in America!''</p>
        <p>Susan Molinari's round little face is all smiley and scrunched up. The  perky pixie looks into the camera for her first live news show, sitting in her spanking new red, white and blue set in the studio at West 57th.</p>
        <p>''First of all, I want to thank the people of Staten Island and Brooklyn for the faith they put in me during my four terms in Congress. And I want to thank Andrew Heyward, the president of CBS, for the faith he put in me, transitioning me from politics to media even though some newsies with no sense of fun complained that I do not have the experience to be a news anchor person.</p>
        <p>''To those of you out there who are worried that I won't have enough objectivity and detachment to be a serious journalist, I would simply say -- Lighten up! How objective does a girl have to be to follow in Diane Sawyer's high heels? Besides, D'Amato and Pataki think that CBS on Saturday morning is the perfect positioning for me to run for the New York Senate seat against George Stephanopoulos, since he's running from ABC on Sunday morning.</p>
        <p>''Oh, my goodness, media critics have tried to turn this into some sort of watershed in the corruption of TV news. But, I mean, what did Rosie O'Donnell know about talk shows before she got one?</p>
        <p>''The only person at CBS who was really upset -- she came at me one day in the cafeteria with an icepick -- was Laura Ingraham, who thought that if Andy wanted a G.O.P. blonde with no experience to star in this show, it should be her.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to work hard to be balanced, and I've assembled a crack team to help me out. Over here on my left is my band, Trent Lott and the 'Singing Senators.' And on my right is my sidekick, Guy Molinari. I call him 'Daddy.' And in his lap is my baby, America's baby, Susan Ruby. This morning, when I got Susan Ruby up, her diaper was off, so then I had to bathe her before I fed her and that annoyed her, so she pooped on the comforter, and we haven't really recouped from that.''</p>
        <p>Susan takes a drag on a cigarette, and giggles. ''I really should quit because of Susan Ruby. But tobacco has done so much for the gross national product.</p>
        <p>''We have a very exciting show today. We'll hear from our answer to Martha Stewart, Kay Bailey Hutchison, who will show us some low-cost, nutritious menus for those moms we finally kicked off welfare. Christie Todd Whitman will take us abroad for a visit with the Beautiful Men of Sweden. We'll have our own free-for-all discussion, in which all points of view will be heard -- someone from the right will argue with someone from the far right. We'll have a review of new hip-hop releases by our rap critic, Pat Boone. We'll have an interview with Tiger Woods by our special correspondent to the U.S. Open, Dan Quayle. Dick Armey will do 'Book Notes.' And Peggy Noonan gives the first of her eloquent weekly commentaries on American values, 'Oh, It Was Ever Thus.'</p>
        <p>''But first we're going to hear from our weatherman, Bill Paxon.''</p>
        <p>''You know, Susie, you don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows. It'll be mild and seasonable in the Republican Sun Belt but there will be showers on the liberal Northeast. Global warming continues to cool, the ozone hole is doing fine and the air quality is, as always, perfect.''</p>
        <p>''Thanks, honey, and can you change the baby's diaper before you go? Now, for my very first guest, I am so thrilled and proud to have someone I really look up to. The Speaker of the House is here to talk about his new book, 'Lessons of Leadership,' which will help him pay off that stupid cost assessment for that appearance of conflict of interest. They said I couldn't bring myself to ask you the tough questions, Newt. Let's prove them wrong.''</p>
        <p>''O.K., Susie, fire away.''</p>
        <p>''O.K., Newt, what's it like to be a great man?''</p>
        <p>''Funny you should ask. That's just what my new book is about. Lesson No. 1: Surround yourself with lieutenants who are more hideous than you are, so that people will be afraid to get rid of you. Lesson No. 2: Think galactically.''</p>
        <p>''You're a genius, Newt. Well, this show flew by faster than a Bill Clinton promise. Join me next week, when my dad will talk about his proposal to crush the skulls of  doctors who perform partial-birth abortions. And that's, like, the way it is.''</p>
