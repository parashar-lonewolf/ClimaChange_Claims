        <p>WITH widening concern over the steady loss of the upper atmosphere's life-protecting ozone, scientists and policy makers are awaiting with a sense of urgency the flow of data from a scientific satellite scheduled to be launched late this week. Its mission is the first systematic study of the stratosphere, probing the causes of the vanishing ozone.</p>
        <p>The $710 million Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite is expected to operate in high orbit for at least 20 months, observing nearly all of the planet with 10 remote-sensing instruments designed specifically to investigate the ozone problem. Scientists hope to identify the physical and chemical processes of the upper atmosphere, determine how they are affected by natural and man-made disturbances and learn how these complex forces affect global climate.</p>

        <p>WITH widening concern over the steady loss of the upper atmosphere's life-protecting ozone, scientists and policy makers are awaiting with a sense of urgency the flow of data from a scientific satellite scheduled to be launched late this week. Its mission is the first systematic study of the stratosphere, probing the causes of the vanishing ozone.</p>
        <p>The $710 million Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite is expected to operate in high orbit for at least 20 months, observing nearly all of the planet with 10 remote-sensing instruments designed specifically to investigate the ozone problem. Scientists hope to identify the physical and chemical processes of the upper atmosphere, determine how they are affected by natural and man-made disturbances and learn how these complex forces affect global climate.</p>
        <p>Of most immediate interest will be the satellite's observations on the processes of ozone formation and destruction. The ozone layer at altitudes of 9 to 30 miles protects living things from the sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation. Gaping holes in the ozone have been detected over the polar regions, and now it appears that this protective shield is also thinning over the most heavily populated regions.</p>
        <p>The Environmental Protection Agency, using previous satellite data, reported last spring that at the latitudes of the United States the loss of ozone was proceeding more than twice as fast as expected.</p>
        <p>The 14,500-pound satellite will be carried into orbit by the space shuttle Discovery, scheduled for launching Thursday at 6:57 P.M., Eastern daylight time. The countdown at the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Fla., began yesterday after engineers determined that a slight helium leak should pose no problem. This will be the fifth shuttle mission this year and the 43d since the reusable vehicles were introduced a decade ago.</p>
        <p>If the flight goes as planned, the five astronauts aboard the Discovery are to release the research satellite from the cargo bay Saturday night. Project officials said it would be at least a month before all the satellite's instruments could be switched on, tested and ready to transmit data.</p>
        <p>The launching is the first major step in Mission to Planet Earth, a multi-year global research program directed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The program will use ground-based, airborne and space-based instruments over the next decade or two to study Earth's environment, focusing particularly on climate and atmospheric changes caused by human activity.</p>
        <p>Previous studies on ozone depletion have lacked the detail and sweep expected of the new satellite. Data from airplanes and balloons were necessarily limited in time and space. The Nimbus-7 weather satellite, which has monitored the ozone "holes" over Antarctica and the Arctic, is unable to show variations in the ozone at different altitudes in a single column of atmosphere.</p>
        <p>"That's where we will be able to contribute to a truly global picture," said Dr. Carl A. Reber, the project scientist at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. "We'll be putting together measurements of many parameters globally, continuously and at all altitudes. Others have looked at bits and pieces of the puzzle; we'll look at all the parts."</p>
        <p>The goal, he said, is to concentrate on gathering data through two complete winters in the Northern Hemisphere, the time of greatest atmospheric turbulence. That is why the launching schedule was recently moved from December to now. The satellite is to be traveling at an altitude of 351 miles on a course taking it as far north and south as 57 degrees latitude on each orbit. But the instruments are positioned to collect data from the atmosphere as far as the 80-degree latitudes, almost to the poles.</p>
        <p>Ozone is a molecule made up of three oxygen atoms that is produced naturally in the upper atmosphere by chemical reactions set in motion by solar radiation. Dr. F. Sherwood Rowland of the University of California at Irvine was among the first scientists to determine that the ozone is being destroyed by chlorofluorocarbons released by refrigerators, air conditioners and some aerosol sprays. As these long-lasting molecules drift higher in the stratosphere, he said, they are eventually broken up by ultraviolet rays, releasing chlorine, a single atom of which can destroy 100,000 molecules of ozone.</p>
        <p>Four of the 10 instruments were designed to measure the concentrations and distribution by altitude and latitude of gases important to ozone depletion, climate change and other atmospheric phenomena. These include nitrogen and chlorine compounds, ozone, water vapor, methane, carbon dioxide and monoxide. Determining Level of Damage</p>
        <p>Dr. John Frederick, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Chicago and member of the project's research team, plans to calculate how quickly ozone is created and destroyed at different latitudes and altitudes. Early theories predicted that most damage to the ozone layer would occur above 18 miles. Now, he said, scientists suspect that chemical reactions at lower altitudes actually cause most of the ozone loss. The satellite should settle the issue.</p>
        <p>Two other instruments should provide the first directly measured picture of horizontal winds from 6 miles to 49 miles above Earth, revealing their role in distributing chemicals in the stratosphere. Four more instruments will observe solar energy reaching Earth and its effects.</p>
        <p>A scientist involved in these solar studies, Dr. Gary Rottman of the University of Colorado, said: "There really doesn't seem to be any doubt that significant changes are occurring in stratospheric ozone levels. But only by measuring the natural variability of solar radiation can we determine how much of the changes are the result of human activity."</p>
