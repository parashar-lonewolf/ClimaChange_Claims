        <p>LEAD: For years the quest for economical solar power has centered on photovoltaic cells that turn sunlight directly into electricity. The cost of the cells is so high, however, that their use has been limited.</p>
        <p>For years the quest for economical solar power has centered on photovoltaic cells that turn sunlight directly into electricity. The cost of the cells is so high, however, that their use has been limited.</p>
        <p>But a more prosaic and less costly method of harnessing the sun, using mirrors to gather energy, is being expanded in the California desert northeast of Los Angeles. It now feeds 194 megawatts of power into Southern California Edison's distribution system, which is enough to serve 270,000 people.</p>
        <p>With tax breaks those ''solar thermal'' plants make electricity at a price that competes with that of power made from oil or gas, and the cost appears likely to be competitive soon even without a subsidy.</p>
        <p>The system, commercialized by Luz International Ltd., makes large quantities of steam by using miles of curved, movable mirrors that focus the sun's heat on pipes filled with a liquid. The liquid is heated by the sun and then pumped through pipes immersed in water. That water is boiled into steam, which is fed through a turbine that turns a generator.</p>
        <p>Only the method of generating the steam is different; the rest of the system is the same as an electric plant that gets its energy from burning oil, coal or gas or from splitting uranium atoms.</p>
        <p>But making electricity from the sun's rays has several advantages over conventional means. The use of expensive, nonrenewable fossil fuels is greatly reduced, although a backup system is required for periods without sun. And emissions of toxic gases and gases contributing to the greenhouse effect are cut back.</p>
        <p>Luz is an American company, based in Los Angeles, that has an Israeli subsidiary that makes the mirrors. It is named for the spot where Jacob dreamed he saw the angels ascending and descending a ladder. The company is already the largest generator of solar electricity in the United States.</p>
        <p>Last year the company added 60 megawatts of solar thermal capacity, compared with world shipments of photovoltaic cells with a capacity of about 35 megawatts. Both numbers are modest - a large nuclear plant can generate 1,000 megawatts - but executives at Luz think their technology is much closer than photovoltaic cells to becoming popular in the electric-utility market.</p>
        <p>The electric-utility grid is the prime use, in fact, for solar thermal stations. By contrast, photovoltaic cells are so costly that they are now practical only where grid power is not available. They were initially developed for the space program and are most familiar in pocket calculators. They have already established an important market niche at remote sites, for use in navigation buoys and mountaintop telecommunications repeater stations, for example.</p>
        <p>While photovoltaic cells are still not cost-competitive with conventional power sources for bulk power generation, engineers and scientists at laboratories around the world are trying new ingredients to lower costs.</p>
        <p>Larry L. Sherwood, director of the American Solar Energy Society, said: ''Photovoltaics clearly has the potential to come down in price. Semiconductor-type technology, just by its nature, tends to come down.''</p>
        <p>Luz officials say their solar thermal installations are already cost-competitive with the expensive sources of electricity used at peak hours, producing power for about 8 cents a kilowatt-hour. Energy analysts say both solar technologies will have applications in replacing fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>Luz has built its operations with the help of Federal and state tax credits, the last of which are scheduled to expire this year. But the company says the system will become commercially viable without subsidies. It has raised more than $750 million in capital from investors like Potomac Electric Power, Baltimore Gas and Electric and Prudential Insurance.</p>
        <p>The Luz energy collection system is based on curved mirrors about six feet high, which concentrate the sun's rays to make them 80 times more powerful. These rays are focused on a black steel pipe filled with a heat-transfer fluid.</p>
        <p>''It's no different from what you tried as a child, when you burned holes in a piece of paper with a lens,'' said Michael Lotker, a vice president of the company. It is considerably hotter, though. The heat-transfer fluid reaches 735 degrees Fahrenheit, which is about 200 degrees hotter than the water used to make steam in most nuclear plants. To hold in the heat, the pipe is surrounded in thermos bottle fashion by a glass tube and a vacuum.</p>
        <p>The plant heats up less than an hour after dawn. As the sun moves across the sky, the motorized, shaft-mounted mirrors rotate to follow, keeping within a tenth of a degree of the sun's position.</p>
        <p>Sunshine, even in the desert, is variable, but so is demand for electricity. In fact, in most of the United States the sun's heat is what determines the peak in electricity demand, because of the air-conditioning load. This allows Luz to provide power almost exactly when it is needed most.</p>
        <p>Luz has added a refinement to cope with demand on cloudy days and after nightfall. It supplements the solar heat supply with a boiler fueled by natural gas.</p>
        <p>To qualify for favorable power purchase terms under Federal law, a solar plant built by an independent power producer must get 75 percent of its heat from the sun. Luz uses natural gas for up to 25 percent, to assure steady output, but a utility that owned such a plant outright could use the natural gas portion without constraint, the company noted.</p>
        <p>In this solar-fossil hybrid, the solar collectors could be thought of as a system for saving natural gas, or fuel oil, the other fossil fuel most often used for small plants that provide electricity to meet peak demand. Each square meter of solar collector will save about a barrel of oil, or 6,000 cubic feet of gas, each year for its 30-year life, Mr. Lotker said.</p>
        <p>The fuel savings from a square meter of mirror would be about $600 over 30 years, assuming current oil prices of about $20 a barrel. One square meter gathers enough energy to light two lightbulbs of 100 watts each; an 80-megawatt plant requires 464,000 square meters, so the total fuel savings could be $278 million.</p>
        <p>Whether such an investment compares favorably with other investments depends on the future price of oil and the price of money. Many analysts are predicting increases in gas prices soon, and over time, oil prices are also likely to rise.</p>
        <p>The value of the technology may also be measured by how much importance society puts on reducing the output of carbon dioxide, the gas most linked to global warming.</p>
        <p>When the system operates in only its solar mode, no carbon dioxide is emitted. Luz officials say the hybrid system produces 0.27 pound of carbon dioxide for every kilowatt generated, compared with 1.1 pounds for plants fueled solely with natural gas, 1.7 pounds for oil and 2 pounds for coal.</p>
        <p>Nitrogen oxides, another pollutant, are 20 times lower than in a conventional gas-fired plant, the company says, and almost three times lower than in a gas plant with advanced pollution-control equipment.</p>
        <p>Luz officials say the cost of land is not a big factor in solar economics. In the desert northeast of Los Angeles where Luz has 194 megawatts in operation and 80 under construction, ''there are thousands of square kilometers serving no useful purpose,'' Mr. Lotker said.  Following the Sun  Luz solar collectors track the sun's daily path across the sky. The collectors focus sunlight onto steel pipes mounted inside vacuum tubes. The pipes contain a heat-transfer fluid that is heated to 735 degrees Fahrenheit. This fluid is pumped through a conventional heat-exchange system to create steam to generate electricity.</p>
