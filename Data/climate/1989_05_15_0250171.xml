        <p>LEAD: The world's deteriorating environment has become a top economic policy concern of the United States and other industrial nations, along with third world debt and trade.</p>
        <p>The world's deteriorating environment has become a top economic policy concern of the United States and other industrial nations, along with third world debt and trade.</p>
        <p>Officials of the Bush Administration and other countries say the environment will be high on their agenda for the annual meeting of the 24-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris scheduled for the end of this month and at the economic summit conference in Paris that President Bush will attend in July with the heads of six other industrial nations.</p>
        <p>A senior economic official in the Bush Administration said, ''We've entered a new era on the environment, and the question is how do we pay for these things.''</p>
        <p>Barring surprises, like turmoil in the exchange rates of the dollar or an eruption of oil prices, the official added: ''I think the summit is going to be dominated by environment and third world debt. It's very important to the President.'' Rising to the Agenda's Top</p>
        <p>William A. Nitze, a top environmental policy official at the State Department, said, ''This is now an issue of consequence that has risen to the top of the international agenda.''</p>
        <p>A senior French economic official said President Francois Mitterrand, the host of the summit conference, considered debt the No. 1 issue, followed by the environment, ''For us, it will be the second priority,'' he said. ''Other countries are keen to put it higher.''</p>
        <p>The heightened concern has been prompted by a torrent of scientific research in the last year, including studies on the harmful effect of chlorofluorocarbons on the earth's protective ozone shield and on the global warming trend resulting from the burning of fuels like oil and gasoline.</p>
        <p>Officials say they plan to emphasize the environment at the economic meetings because environmental abuse is driven mostly by economic phenomena and can best be averted with economic incentives.</p>
        <p>While the governments agree on the priority of the environmental issues, they are divided over what to do, how soon they have to act and what they ought to spend.</p>
        <p>The Bush Administration, for example, opposes committing itself to a convention to curb fuel burning until more work on solutions has been completed. Several Approaches</p>
        <p>The governments are considering several approaches to managing the environment, including these:</p>
        <p>* Granting developing countries breaks on their foreign debts as inducements to curb environmental abuse.</p>
        <p>* Requiring the big international lenders, like the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Inter-American Development Bank, to set tougher environmental criteria for making loans for industrial development.</p>
        <p>* Moving their governments closer to more agreements like an 80-nation accord in Helsinki this month to stop the depletion of the ozone layer by the year 2000.</p>
        <p>In putting greater economic importance on the environment, the United States and the other summit countries - Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada - are also acknowledging that they will have to assume more of the burden of curbing the deterioration of the world environment that originates in third world countries, not just at home.</p>
        <p>Administration officials say they see an opportunity to help the environment by providing tax breaks or regulatory changes that encourage greater involvement by banks in ''debt for nature'' swaps.</p>
        <p>In these arrangements, governments or environmental organizations buy loans that commercial banks have made to developing countries, at the drastically reduced market value of the loans. In return, the debtor nation might agree to exclude a natural resource, like a forest or a lake, from development.</p>
