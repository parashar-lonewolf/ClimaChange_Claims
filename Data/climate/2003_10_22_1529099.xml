        <p>LAWRENCE ANG never intended to be environmentally correct. He wanted a new car with an economical price tag, good gas mileage and looks he liked. By choosing a Ford Focus, he also got a car with tailpipe emissions so low they are often cleaner than the ambient air in smoggy urban areas.</p>
        <p>''To be honest, I never considered the low emissions, and didn't really find out about it until after I bought it,'' said Mr. Ang, 36, a computer technician who lives here. ''But it never hurts. I'm hoping it means I will have years of no trouble with smog tests.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ang is not the only person who bought a Focus this year, thinking it was no different from other cars. Most of them are no different, but the ones sold in California and some other states are partial zero emission vehicles, or P.Z.E.V.'s (as are 11 additional brands made by seven other manufacturers). Though these vehicles burn gasoline, more than 90 percent of their smog-producing emissions are removed, compared with the average new car.</p>
        <p>This is the first year that automakers have mass-produced the P.Z.E.V., and the car is not well known among consumers. Compared with the hoopla surrounding hybrids (cars powered by gas and electric motor), which are currently on the market, and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (a combination of hydrogen and water that creates electricity), which are a decade from assembly lines, its arrival on the market has been muted. (A third alternative to fossil fuel, the battery-powered engine, is regarded as too impractical for most everyday use.)</p>
        <p>''The more advanced technologies, the ones getting away from gasoline, are the sexier technologies,'' said Alan C. Lloyd, chairman of the California Air Resources Board, the regulatory agency that in 1990 required automakers to mass-produce zero-emission vehicles, or Z.E.V.'s, setting off the search for nonpolluting cars.</p>
        <p>''But in terms of breathing cleaner air,'' Dr. Lloyd added, ''it is easier for companies to come out with hundreds of thousands of P.Z.E.V.'s than the more revolutionary technologies.''</p>
        <p>Evaporative emissions from the engine and fuel tank of a P.Z.E.V. are almost nonexistent.</p>
        <p>And the price of these cars is either the same as regular models or slightly higher (about $200 at most), depending on the manufacturer. P.Z.E.V.'s range from $13,000 for a Ford Focus compact to $28,000 for a BMW 325i sedan. Horsepower is roughly the same, as is fuel efficiency. Moreover, all P.Z.E.V.'s have a 15-year or 150,000-mile warranty on the smog controls.</p>
        <p>''The beauty of the technology is that manufacturers are applying it to cars that everyday people can buy,'' said Jerry Martin, a spokesman for the California air board. ''And with the warranty, second or third owners, who are frequently lower-income, will have a car running like new.''</p>
        <p>Automakers sell P.Z.E.V.'s only where they are mandated, in California and those states that have adopted its tough air-quality standards, Massachusetts, New York and Vermont. The cars are therefore not nationally advertised, making it difficult for them to shed their obscurity. Maine, which adopted a less stringent version of the California mandate, will also get P.Z.E.V.'s from some manufacturers. About 135,000 P.Z.E.V.'s will be sold nationwide this year, 100,000 of which will go to the California market, according to the air board. By 2012, the agency estimates that the state will have 3.4 million such cars on the roads.</p>
        <p>To convert regular models, automakers have spent an average of several hundred dollars on each car.</p>
        <p>With uncertain market demand, higher production costs make manufacturers hesitant to produce more P.Z.E.V.'s, especially when their profits are being squeezed by the current competitive market. The other concern to manufacturers is the warranty, which would be harder to meet in states outside California, where gasoline formulations are not as clean.</p>
        <p>The marketing approach to these vehicles is typified by Nissan, which came out with the first P.Z.E.V., in 2000, the Sentra CA. (The company produced only a small number, limited to the California market.)</p>
        <p>''Some of the research we've done shows consumers think there is a trade-off between environmental friendliness and other attributes,'' said Ken Zapp, a Nissan executive. ''We don't downplay it, but it's not the primary selling point.'' Carmakers worry that consumers will think that P.Z.E.V.'s performances will suffer at the expense of their environmental virtues.</p>
        <p>Only Ford is breaking from the pack, having recently completed its first television advertisement highlighting the Focus's virtues. The ad, titled ''Cleaner and Meaner,'' will be broadcast in California and the Northeast.</p>
        <p>''We've got nothing to be ashamed of,'' said Rich Stoddart, the Ford Division marketing communications manager. ''We're terrifically proud of a power train that delivers environmental friendliness and more performance than you might expect.''</p>
        <p>Foreign manufacturers, especially Honda, Toyota and Nissan, led the way toward developing P.Z.E.V. technology, selling such versions of the Accord, Camry and Sentra, respectively. The other P.Z.E.V.'s are the Volvo S60 and S70, the Volkswagen Jetta, the Subaru Legacy L and Outback and versions of the BMW 325 series. Ford is currently the only American automaker producing P.Z.E.V.'s. Several foreign companies and Ford are coming out with additional models in 2004.</p>
        <p>Ron Cogan, the editor and publisher of the Green Car Journal, a magazine based in San Luis Obispo, Calif., that covers cars and the environment, thinks that Ford will spur the competition to do likewise.</p>
        <p>''Automakers haven't had the best crystal ball when it comes to environmental regulation and marketing green cars,'' Mr. Cogan said. ''But environmental benefits are going to become a competitive issue and another buying criteria.''</p>
        <p>The California air board and the other states that have adopted its standards consider the P.Z.E.V. clean enough to earn manufacturers a partial credit toward the zero emission vehicle mandate, which takes effect in 2005. But how manufacturers meet that mandate varies with the number of credits they have earned, and which technologies they have chosen to develop. Ford, for example, is putting most of its stock in its P.Z.E.V. engine, and plans to offer it as an option on all Focus cars in 2004, expecting to sell 69,000 by next year. A total of 240,000 Focuses were sold for the 2003 model year.</p>
        <p>General Motors has not committed to a P.Z.E.V. as part of its strategy to comply with California's mandate.</p>
        <p>''If we come to market with P.Z.E.V.'s, it won't be until 2005 to 2010,'' said Dave Barthmuss, a G.M. spokesman. ''Our goal is to establish the commercial viability of hydrogen fuel cells. We see that as the ultimate endgame.''</p>
        <p>The greening of the gasoline engine is a result of many small improvements and not any one significant change.</p>
        <p>Partial zero emission vehicles have better fuel combustion, extremely precise valve-control and fuel-injection systems and exhaust control that instantly eliminate cold-start emissions. Evaporative emissions are cut by tighter gaskets, hoses and fuel tanks.</p>
        <p>The next challenge for automakers is for them to adapt P.Z.E.V. technology to pickups and sport utility vehicles, a more difficult task because these engines use much larger volumes of gas and oxygen. Still, automotive engineers think that P.Z.E.V. technology will make it onto S.U.V.'s before hydrogen fuel cell cars hit the mass market. (Toyota and Ford will produce hybrid S.U.V.'s next year.)</p>
        <p>Environmentalists hail the P.Z.E.V. and California's lead in improving air quality. But they also point out that though two of the pollutants that contribute to global warming, nitrous oxide and methane, are reduced by P.Z.E.V.'s, the main culprit, carbon dioxide, is not.</p>
        <p>''The next frontier in California is tackling global warming, especially carbon dioxide emissions,'' said Roland Hwang, a senior policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council. ''We've been doing well on smog, but with global warming we've been going backwards over the past 15 years.''</p>
