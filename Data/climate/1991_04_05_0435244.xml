        <p>The ozone layer, which protects living things from the Sun's harmful ultraviolet rays, has been depleted in many areas of the globe, and at the latitudes of the United States the loss is proceeding more than twice as fast as scientists had expected, the Environmental Protection Agency announced yesterday.</p>

        <p>The ozone layer, which protects living things from the Sun's harmful ultraviolet rays, has been depleted in many areas of the globe, and at the latitudes of the United States the loss is proceeding more than twice as fast as scientists had expected, the Environmental Protection Agency announced yesterday.</p>
        <p>The agency said the declines measured in the late fall, winter and early spring amounted to 4.5 to 5 percent in the last decade.</p>
        <p>"It is stunning information," William K. Reilly, the agency's Administrator, said in a telephone interview after the announcement in Washington. "It is unexpected, it is disturbing and it possesses implications we have not yet had time to fully explore."</p>
        <p>The weakened ozone shield lets in more ultraviolet light, a cause of skin cancer. According to agency calculations based on the new ozone findings, over the next 50 years about 12 million Americans will develop skin cancer, and more than 200,000 of them will die. These would be in addition to the more than 8,000 deaths a year now caused by skin cancer. Under previous assumptions, 500,000 added cancer cases and 9,300 fatalities were forecast from ozone depletion.</p>
        <p>The data announced yesterday showed that ozone depletion extended farther south than had been thought, reaching the southernmost parts of the country, and that it lasted longer, starting in late fall and extending in some cases into May, said Dr. Michael Kurylo, the director of the space agency's upper atmosphere research program. The analysis was conducted by Dr. Richard Stolarsky, an atmospheric scientist at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. His research was supported by Dr. Kurylo's office.  Call for Policy Change</p>
        <p>The findings, Mr. Reilly said, make necessary a reappraisal of both United States and international policy on the control of the ozone-destroying chemicals, chiefly chlorofluorocarbons. These chemicals are used as the fluid that transfers heat in refrigerators and air conditioners. They have many other industrial uses, including as solvents and propellants in aerosol cans.</p>
        <p>Most of the world's nations vowed last June in London to halt production of the chemicals by the end of the century, in the case of developed countries, and by the year 2010 in the case of developing nations. That pledge, Mr. Reilly said, "may well turn out to be inadequate."</p>
        <p>Michael Deland, the chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said that neither he nor other concerned officials at the White House had yet reviewed the findings. But he said they "would not come as a great surprise," since measurement techniques are becoming more accurate, and added, "I think that before we undertake a major overhaul of U.S. or worldwide policies, we need to very carefully scrutinize this and other reports to evaluate the accuracy in a deliberative and comprehensive scientific way."</p>
        <p>The environmental agency's announcement was based on the agency's analysis of ozone measurements made by an instrument called the total ozone mapping spectrometer aboard a satellite operated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The data had been circulating in the scientific community for some time, but specialists at the environmental agency only recently completed their analysis.</p>
        <p>Earlier, less extensive ground-based measurements had suggested that ozone over the United States had been depleted in the wintertime by about 2 percent from 1969 to 1986.</p>
        <p>The new satellite measurements refer to what is called "column ozone," the amount of ozone over any given spot on the earth. According to the satellite measurements, ozone losses over the last decade occurred at the same rate throughout the Northern Hemisphere temperate zone, which includes North America, Europe, the Soviet Union and most of Asia.</p>
        <p>The world has responded in increasingly strong terms to the ozone threat. In 1987, 57 nations met in Montreal and adopted a treaty calling for a 50 percent reduction in the production of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's, and other ozone-depleting chemicals. At that time, no depletion of ozone had been observed over the United States, said Eileen Claussen, an environmental agency specialist on ozone.</p>
        <p>By the London conference last June, measurements of ultraviolet rays from preliminary satellite surveys and ground stations indicated a 1.5 percent decrease in high-level ozone over the United States.</p>
        <p>The new measurements, unlike the preliminary satellite readings, were taken over more than 11 years, thereby making it possible to account for, and filter out of the analysis, changes in ultraviolet radiation caused by the solar cycle. The measurements began in 1978 and ran until mid-1990. Massive Loss Over Antarctica</p>
        <p>Losses were progressively worse toward the pole. At the latitude of Hudson Bay and Sweden, the ozone losses exceeded 8 percent over the decade. Measurements from aircraft in 1989 placed the column ozone loss near the North Pole at about an additional 6 percent. There were no significant losses over the tropics.</p>
        <p>In the Southern Hemisphere, the picture is complicated by the huge ozone "hole" discovered over Antarctica in the mid-1980's. Inside the hole, column ozone has been depleted by as much as 50 percent in some winters since the mid-1980's. Elsewhere in the hemisphere, losses averaged roughly an additional 2 percentage points more than in the Northern Hemisphere, and the period of depletion lasted longer, Dr. Kurylo said.</p>
        <p>No average global loss was calculated on the basis of the satellite data.</p>
        <p>Scientists estimate that for every 1 percent decline in the high-altitude ozone shield, 2 percent more ultraviolet radiation reaches the earth's surface. Besides skin cancer, the harmful ultraviolet radiation can cause eye cataracts. Scientists say it also can affect the human immune system adversely; that it harms the ability of phytoplankton, tiny plants at the basis of the oceanic food chain, to reproduce, and that it can damage some crops and wild plants.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's announcement raised alarms among environmentalists. The news "is very bad," said Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, an atmospheric scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund. "It means that over the next couple of decades, the level of ozone depletion could border on the disastrous, and it underscores the need to avoid taking risks with global life support systems like the ozone layer and also like the world's climate," he said.</p>
