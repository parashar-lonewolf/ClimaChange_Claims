        <p>In DISTRACTION (Spectra/Bantam, $23.95) the estimable Bruce Sterling demonstrates why science fiction is such a difficult genre to get right. One of the inventors of cyberpunk, the stylistic and conceptual revolution that helped revitalize science fiction in the 1980's, Sterling has gone on to imagine densely layered futures inhabited by quirkily obsessive characters in novels like ''Islands in the Net,'' ''Heavy Weather'' and ''Holy Fire.'' The mid-21st-century America that forms the backdrop for ''Distraction'' is as elaborately detailed as any near-future milieu in recent science fiction. Yet the very detail that Sterling has provided undercuts the story he wants to tell and reduces the players in the drama to bloodless puppets of the authorial imagination.</p>
        <p>Oscar Valparaiso, a brilliant political operative, is ''not exactly human,'' having been birthed in a vat by a black market ''embryo mill'' that fooled around with his DNA to enhance his powers of survival. The book opens at a moment of triumph: Oscar has masterminded the election to the Senate of an idiosyncratic architect named Alcott Bambakias.</p>

        <p>In DISTRACTION (Spectra/Bantam, $23.95) the estimable Bruce Sterling demonstrates why science fiction is such a difficult genre to get right. One of the inventors of cyberpunk, the stylistic and conceptual revolution that helped revitalize science fiction in the 1980's, Sterling has gone on to imagine densely layered futures inhabited by quirkily obsessive characters in novels like ''Islands in the Net,'' ''Heavy Weather'' and ''Holy Fire.'' The mid-21st-century America that forms the backdrop for ''Distraction'' is as elaborately detailed as any near-future milieu in recent science fiction. Yet the very detail that Sterling has provided undercuts the story he wants to tell and reduces the players in the drama to bloodless puppets of the authorial imagination.</p>
        <p>Oscar Valparaiso, a brilliant political operative, is ''not exactly human,'' having been birthed in a vat by a black market ''embryo mill'' that fooled around with his DNA to enhance his powers of survival. The book opens at a moment of triumph: Oscar has masterminded the election to the Senate of an idiosyncratic architect named Alcott Bambakias.</p>
        <p>Sterling's vision of the United States in the year 2044 is challenging, to say the least. Global warming has raised sea levels worldwide, flooding low-lying coastal areas. The Chinese have bankrupted America by making ''all English-language intellectual property freely available on their satellite networks''; the Air Force, starved for funds, is shaking down motorists at highway blockades. Birth rates are plunging; death rates are soaring. There are 16 major political parties; ''Emergency Congressional committees'' and strong local politicians have seized great chunks of power from the Federal Government.</p>
        <p>The plot concerns Oscar's efforts to bring some kind of order to the ''biggest bio-research center in the world,'' a famously out-of-control facility known as the Buna National Collaboratory. But so unlikely is the next-century scenario concocted by Sterling that I found myself unable to take the actions of his characters seriously, even as satire. Ideas as counterintuitive as the bankrupting of the United States by the overnight obliteration of copyright and trademark laws cannot function as mere background for other events; they call for front-and-center treatment on their own.</p>
        <p>Sterling seems aware that readers may balk at his wilder suppositions; he pre-emptively tags his imagined America as ''weird,'' ''mad,'' ''crazy.'' Oscar's behavior, which follows no rules I could divine, raises similar objections, which are hardly laid to rest by having a colleague characterize him as ''just a very, very weird guy.''</p>
        <p>Many of Sterling's speculations, taken separately, are entertaining if only because of their thought-provoking absurdity. But strung together without regard for historical or narrative logic, they overwhelm the reader, ultimately failing to engage either the mind or the emotions.</p>
        <p>--------------------</p>
        <p>William Shatner, who once fought for universal decency as Capt. James Kirk of the Starship Enterprise, has lent his talents (or at least his name) to several series of science fiction books for young people. STEP INTO CHAOS (Harper Prism, $23) is the third novel in his ''Quest for Tomorrow'' series. I confess that I have not read the first two volumes, but Shatner has thoughtfully provided a four-and-a-half-page synopsis that is no more confusing than the novel itself. Suffice it to say that the 17-year-old Jim Endicott holds the key to the fate of the human species, not to mention at least two rival galactic empires. Getting him to shoulder his responsibilities is not easy, however, because he has been drinking too much ever since he accidentally killed the man he believed to be his father.</p>
        <p>We know that he is suffering because when his mother bursts into tears, ''guilt bloomed as a ball of nausea in his stomach.'' Saving the universe leaves precious little time for therapy, even with a shrink savvy enough to understand that Jim's experiences have left him with a severe case of ''adolescent adjustment disorder.'' Fortunately, Jim pulls himself together in time to confront some really scary stuff, like the telepathic machinations of the disembodied intelligence known as Outsider: ''The darkness seemed to breathe inside his skull. Then it subsided, leaving behind the emotional equivalent of a bathtub ring, a feeling of scum stuck to the sides of his psyche.''</p>
        <p>What makes science fiction such a remarkable genre is that in fewer than 240 pages an emotionally and stylistically challenged protagonist like Jim can end up chatting with God, resuscitating the man he called Dad and reinventing the universe. Through it all, Jim remains the same decent teen-ager he has always been. When he learns in the new and improved universe that he has killed someone -- not Dad this time but Dad's would-be assassin -- the nausea of guilt blooms on cue in his gut: ''It felt . . . it felt awful.''</p>
        <p>--------------------</p>
        <p>In contrast, all the hilarity in GODSHOME (Tor/Tom Doherty, $22.95), by Robert Sheckley, is intentional. Sheckley has long been considered one of the genre's leading humorists -- a somewhat hollow distinction since, with the exception of Douglas Adams's ''Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' series, science fiction has rarely enjoyed laughing at itself. And in fact ''Godshome'' is better described as a whimsical fantasy with scientific trappings.</p>
        <p>When Arthur Fenn, an unemployed ''Ph.D. in comparative mythology,'' receives an ancient Hebrew tome, he is slow to realize that the spells scratched on its pages give him access to the gods of earlier civilizations. These deities, who lost their jobs when their last worshipers died, live in a cosmic old-age facility called Godshome. Despite Fenn's entreaties, most prefer to remain in comfortable retirement rather than help him out of the financial jam he has stumbled into. The only gods who answer his call turn out to be mischief makers. Getting rid of them requires, in the end, the creation of a new universe.</p>
        <p>Sheckley has some fun with the grumpy old divinities, who refuse to return to the ''god eat god'' rivalries on Earth, and with the false religion started by the real gods who accept Arthur's invitation. But in places the whimsy gets as thick as week-old goulash. To enter fully into the spirit of ''Godshome,'' you have to be able to enjoy the banter of a narcissistic ''singularity'' at the center of a black hole, whose appearance varies from ''a ball of wiry black hair out of which two bright eyes peeked'' to a ''green 1938 Oldsmobile,'' and who asks Arthur during an interview, ''So how did you like my event horizon?'' Other readers may second the opinion of a minor deity named Scabber who reveals that ''if there's one thing a god finds boring it's talking to a human in a dream.''</p>
