        <p>After Al Gore ran for president in 1988 and lost, just as he turned 40, he organized a series of dinners at which he went around the room asking each person to tell him where he had gone wrong. What hadn't he known? What hadn't he done?</p>
        <p>It was excruciating, his friends said, but he insisted on hearing the bad news -- in detail -- about a campaign that had started out as an environmental crusade and ended as a New York food fight between his surrogate, Mayor Edward I. Koch, and his one friend among the other candidates, the Rev. Jesse Jackson.</p>
        <p>At dinner, he heard that he had no economic vision and that he had talked about technology and the environment in ways people could not understand. Oh, and his speaking style needed a ton of work.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore responded, as he has at every critical moment of his life, by going back to school. He put together a graduate seminar for one, complete with a syllabus and a heavy-duty reading list, and applied himself to the serious study of tax policy and business history. He brought in a mathematician to explain chaos theory. And he hired a speech consultant and a dance coach -- ''a ballet type,'' he told one friend -- to help him move more fluidly.</p>
        <p>Politicians often learn from and are even transformed by a good drubbing at the polls, but few have pursued their lessons as aggressively as Mr. Gore. No one can say that the man who will accept the Democratic Party's nomination for the presidency tonight has not diligently  readied himself.</p>
        <p>Yet all this extensive preparation has not always shown in the Gore campaign, which until recently has seemed surprisingly unfocused, at least in part because Mr. Gore has been training to govern from a young age but has always shown mixed feelings about politics.</p>
        <p>''I'm a lot more comfortable with the idea of rolling up my sleeves and making the system work than I am with the campaigning: Vote for me! vote for me!'' he says in a Spike Jonze documentary shot on his recent vacation in North Carolina.</p>
        <p>He is a student by nature -- even after Vietnam, he treated his moral hangover with a year of divinity school, saying he wanted to impose some structure on the exercise. His extraordinary willingness to learn and change has taught him a lot, but it has also left him open to the rap that he is constantly reinventing himself.</p>
        <p>Reinvention isn't all bad. In 1981, when Mr. Gore became concerned about where the cold war was headed, he turned himself into a bona fide arms-control expert in a single year by plunging into the arcana of a subject he had previously known next to nothing about. In the 1990's, he was out front in learning about issues no one else was paying much mind, like information technology and global warming.</p>
        <p>''His education is ongoing,'' said his Harvard friend Tommy Lee Jones. ''Where 20 years ago he would have made outlines with Roman numerals, now it would look like rectangles on top of each other, equally well organized but not so linear, and probably three-dimensional.''</p>
        <p>Yet this quality has been nothing but trouble in the current campaign. Much of the coverage has dwelled on Mr. Gore's small but symbolic personal alterations, like his new Palm Pilot and his switch from dark suits to earth tones. The changes themselves are insignificant, but resonate because they remind many people of his shifts on issues like gun control and abortion.</p>
        <p>It is the same story with Mr. Gore's work ethic -- something Americans profess to love. He was so determined to shoehorn extra work into his day as a senator that during weekends of back-to-back town hall meetings he would get himself booked in two places at the same time -- a trick that was possible, barely, because there are two time zones in Tennessee.</p>
        <p>He adored the illusion of time-bending, a former aide said. ''I'd tell him, 'You just missed 400 people in Knoxville because we crossed back to some backwater county to see three people.' And he'd say, 'Yeah, but we get an extra hour.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore is someone who makes all his hard work look like . . . hard work. Lacking the smooth moves of either his boss, Bill Clinton, or his Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush, Mr. Gore is a plodder, who hopes to be a tortoise to Mr. Bush's hare.</p>
        <p>But there is more going on than raw effort. Mr. Gore's intellect and the willingness to use it are probably his most important assets. His Harvard mentor, the presidential scholar Richard Neustadt, has said that compared with American presidents in the last century, probably only Theodore Roosevelt had a keener mind. Mr. Gore's friends often see him as a visionary.</p>
        <p>His oldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, said, ''He likes to ask, 'What's the assumption here? What if we subvert it?' and one of the things he could maybe do well if he wins the job is make new connections, like between the economy and the environment, and ask, 'What if we were the leading exporter of ways to clean up the environment?' ''</p>
        <p>Those are not the kind of connections that crowds thrill to, though. All Mr. Gore's intelligence and dexterity with facts do not necessarily help him sway the public with feeling -- something he knows all too well.</p>
        <p>One senior member of the Clinton administration says that the interesting thing about watching Mr. Gore in a meeting is the way he reasons deductively, rather than inductively, relying less than most other politicians on anecdotes and more on all that is known about a given topic. Again, this is both a strength and a failing. While he is able to analyze options dispassionately, he does not seem to understand fully how important human stories are in communicating about policy with the public.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore is genuinely in love with the world of ideas, loves nothing more than a good back and forth about the multiverse, and apparently sees how fractal geometry might improve our lives.</p>
        <p>He is a sucker for fun facts, too -- and always alert for openings to share them. During his campaign visits to schools, he has delivered spontaneous lectures on the ice ages, the industrial revolution and the human genome.</p>
        <p>In a recent interview in his car, while heading to a fund-raiser in the Hamptons, he started to explain how Long Island was formed, then stopped himself. At another point in the ride, he cried, ''Look at that!'' and pointed to a sign about an exhibition called ''Black Whalers.''</p>
        <p>''Do you know about the black whalers?'' he asked, very excited, and went on to tell the history of African-Americans in Sag Harbor. ''I'm hoping they can find somewhere for me to go to church here tomorrow, but my staff wants me to go to a diner instead,'' he said, making a face. ''Better pictures,'' he added, and rolled his eyes. (In the end, he went to the church.)</p>
        <p>He seems to have quite a rich emotional life -- is clearly still over the moon for Tipper Gore, his wife of 30 years, and enviably close to their four children. By all accounts, he is someone who actually listens to his friends when they have had a bad day or a family problem.</p>
        <p>He is also big on small gestures, like having a neatly pressed, beautifully boxed $5 bill delivered to a consultant, Robert Shrum, in his London hotel room last year after losing a bet about whether another top aide, Carter Eskew, was planning to propose to his girlfriend. (Mr. Gore bet against true love and lost.)</p>
        <p>Still, he struggles with the kinds of connections that most city council members find effortless.</p>
        <p>In a recent stop in New York, where he had just appeared on NBC's ''Today'' show, he was working one end of a crowd at Rockefeller Center as Al Roker, the weatherman, worked the other. It wasn't a fair matchup, because Mr. Roker had a camera crew in tow, but the crowd did seem more enthusiastic about meeting the other Al.</p>
        <p>Except for one middle-aged woman, who was jumping up and down and clearly could not wait to greet the vice president. Yet when he reached her, he not only failed to milk the moment, he raced through it -- his eyes instinctively, and much too quickly, cutting to the next person on the rope line, in search of someone who was not quite as eager to meet him.</p>
        <p>Complications and Contradictions</p>
        <p>At 52, Albert Arnold Gore is without question a complicated man. He is a native of Washington, born there on March 31, 1948. And through his father, he met the men who ran the world. Senator Albert Gore was an up-from-nothing child of the Depression whose stands for civil rights and against the war in Vietnam were out of sync with his Tennessee constituents and lost him his seat in 1970. Yet young Al Gore had something of a double life even in the capital, where he attended elite St. Alban's prep school, but dressed in a cousin's hand-me-downs. He shared a bedroom with his sister, Nancy, who was 10 years older, in a four-room hotel suite because it was owned by a relative who gave his family a break on the rent.</p>
        <p>He is also a real Tennessean, who spent summers there, working hard on the family farm, and while there made his closest friends, many of whom remain in his life.</p>
        <p>He is someone who prays over meals and quotes the Bible. But he is also devoted to science, and spends the time in the helicopter en route to Air Force Two reading magazines like Nature, Science and Discover.</p>
        <p>Some of his most deeply felt positions -- in support of both free trade and the labor unions, for example -- create political contradictions. And sometimes, he seems to be fighting himself as much as he is Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>He can be an incredibly careful man, yet sometimes has been unusually willing to make himself vulnerable, as he did in writing ''Earth in the Balance,'' a confessional  manifesto in which he ties man's mistreatment of the environment to a lack of deep connection in dysfunctional families.</p>
        <p>One knock against Mr. Gore is that he has not shown himself to be sufficiently human. But it may be that he has shown himself to be all too human, someone who does sweat the small stuff and is cursed with a level of self-awareness that does not appear to trouble Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Recently, there was a million-dollar party in the Hamptons in his honor.</p>
        <p>Fireworks were planned, but they started badly. Mr. Gore had already turned to leave when they suddenly erupted into a splendid celestial spectacle. He wandered out onto the lawn, alone, for a better look.</p>
        <p>For much of the show he stood there, his silhouette rigid and even lonely against the blazing sky. Only when the model Christie Brinkley playfully started snapping his picture did he seem to realize he was supposed to look as if he was having a good time.</p>
        <p>And from remarks he made later, it was clear that he had been thinking about his quest to become president and whether he was falling short. As he bid farewell to his hosts and guests, who had paid $10,000 each to have dinner with him, he drew a pointed analogy between the initial fizzle of the fireworks and his own trajectory.</p>
        <p>''I know that some of you were feeling momentarily disappointed with the fireworks,'' he said. ''Some of you felt let down. Some were even heartbroken. But you believed it was going to happen, and it did. And I know that during this campaign, some of you have felt like there were times when you wondered how it was going to go.''</p>
        <p>This time, the vice president pulled himself back from the brink of further reflection and promised to do better from then on.</p>
        <p>But in a life of constant movement and all-too-brief, good-to-see-you, good-to-see-you encounters, he is unusually reflective, and someone who applies the language of psychology to his understanding of the world.</p>
        <p>A decade ago, after his 6-year-old son ran into the street and was hit by a car right in front of him, Mr. Gore did what one friend called ''psychotherapy by correspondence course'' -- trying to puzzle through his life by reading and listening to personal development tapes.</p>
        <p>He passed out copies of psychological texts he had been especially struck by, including ''How People Change,'' by Allen Wheelis.</p>
        <p>In it, the author describes how he developed anxiety attacks after his cruelly demanding father made him cut their lawn with a hand razor. It is impossible to read it without thinking of the summer that Mr. Gore's father put him through an equally pointless character-building exercise, making him clear 20 hilly acres with a hand ax.</p>
        <p>The job would have taken just a few hours with a bulldozer, as Mr. Gore's high school girlfriend in Tennessee, Donna Armistead, remembers it. ''One day I stopped by and he had got in a nest of hornets. The poor guy was eaten up, but it didn't matter,'' she said bitterly. ''His dad said it had to be done.''</p>
        <p>Even now, amid the craziness of the campaign, Mr. Gore is a highly interior person, who can withdraw deep inside himself quite suddenly. He loved the dark, out-there movie ''Being John Malkovich.'' (Mr. Bush says the last movie he enjoyed in a theater was ''Forrest Gump.'') One relative describes Mr. Gore as ''very edgy'' in a business that does not award a lot of points for edge.</p>
        <p>Asked if Mr. Gore had seemed happy as a student at Harvard, where he was, after all, facing service in Vietnam, his mentor, Mr. Neustadt, said: ''I'd have called him an intellectually interested kid, a questioning, pondering kid. In social situations, he was pleasant and capable of enjoyment, but happy? There were always a lot of issues Al was concerned about morally. I wouldn't have called him happy.''</p>
        <p>Confidence in Leadership</p>
        <p>Yet he does not seem to suffer from a lack of confidence; this is a man who applied only to Harvard because it never occurred to him that he would not get in. When he became a reporter, he seems to have assumed he would follow in the footsteps of David Halberstam, a friend of his sister's, who had won a Pulitzer Prize. Mr. Gore ran for Congress at 28 and began mounting his first presidential campaign only 10 years later. Had he been elected, he would have been the youngest American president in history.</p>
        <p>It turned out that he wasn't ready, and he ended up an observer in his own campaign, watching it fall apart as Mr. Koch, waged a public feud with Mr. Jackson.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said in a recent interview about that time in his life: ''The statements made by Mayor Koch took me by surprise. I had no advance notice, was not happy about it and didn't handle it very well.''</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Gore himself had snidely knocked Mr. Jackson, saying the country was electing a president, not a preacher. Mr. Gore was soon overwhelmed with guilt, horrified in particular by the racial implications of the Koch-Jackson fight, something he should have known about before seeking an alliance with Mr. Koch. In the campaign's final days, Mr. Gore was asking Mr. Jackson's forgiveness almost every night.</p>
        <p>Why would anyone have believed he was ready for the White House at such a young age?</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore had been a virtual grown-up since he was a child, expected to perform in the company of important adults. He had seen the nation's leaders up close, and had not been daunted.</p>
        <p>In his first Senate term, he was already bored. And he simply could not wait to lead, he said, to take the country where he felt it ought to go.</p>
        <p>His father was pushing him, even playing on his emotions by saying he wanted to see his boy elected president before he died. But aides say he was at least as influenced by the simple availability of cash from the party's money men, once it became clear that neither Mario M. Cuomo nor Dale Bumpers would make the race. And his head was turned by the media -- Washington reporters who could not get enough of him.</p>
        <p>Not quite two years after he was elected to the Senate, the talk show host John McLaughlin said this in an interview: ''You've got the magical name -- Al Gore. Your father was in Congress for 32 years. You've got character, you've got no clay feet, no skeletons showing. You're intelligent. You're well-informed. You've got a Vietnam War record. You've been an investigative reporter, and you've got religious coloration, too.</p>
        <p>''For one year you were a divinity student, and you're a devout Baptist.</p>
        <p>''You're almost too good to be true. Are you too good to be true?''</p>
        <p>(Mr. Gore's answer, for the record: ''I don't know.'')</p>
        <p>The Clinton Factor</p>
        <p>Bill Clinton's impeachment and Mr. Gore's own role in the fund-raising scandals of recent years took care of that perception, of course. Mr. Gore was criticized for the fund-raising phone calls he made from the White House and his attendance at a fund-raiser at a Buddhist temple in Los Angeles in 1996.</p>
        <p>And he cannot say his mother never warned him about hooking up with Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Back in the mid-80's, James Fleming, a Nashville physician who was for a time the family doctor, remembers a conversation at the family farm in Carthage about Mr. Clinton, then the governor of Arkansas, who had just visited Nashville.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's mother, Pauline LaFon Gore, who like her husband grew up poor and put herself through law school, has often been considered the political brains in the family. And on this occasion, she was adamant. ''She said he had bad moral character,'' Dr. Fleming said. ''She said, 'Bill Clinton is not a nice person. You shouldn't associate too closely with him.' ''</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Gore went on the ticket with Mr. Clinton, he says, because he thought he could help: ''I thought I could make a difference, and maybe the difference.''</p>
        <p>And he makes it clear that he listened to his mama, whom he calls every day.</p>
        <p>''This guy's done a great job by and large and has strengths I don't,'' he said in the car the other day. ''But then, I have strengths he doesn't.''</p>
        <p>Recently, he added a line to his stump speech: ''I won't let you down.'' The subtext being, of course, that certain others had.</p>
        <p>But the phrase also reflects an important truth about Mr. Gore. He was made responsible for his parents' hopes from an early age, and was raised not to let his family down. He often talks about his work and his life in a way that suggests he defines himself as someone people are depending on.</p>
        <p>''He's trying to be a good night watchman,'' a relative of Mr. Gore's said. ''That's the kind of president he would be.''</p>
        <p>Yet because of his ambivalence about politics, in some past races he has seemed focused only in the final stages of the campaign, on deadline, like the former news reporter he is. There is typically a last-minute flurry of ''new Al Gore'' stories, detailing his metamorphosis from lackluster to ''newly energized'' campaigner. And aides certainly hope they see that beginning now, as he bonds with his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut.</p>
        <p>On Long Island the other day, Mr. Gore gave his own theory about the stories that begin, ''In yet another attempt to reinvent himself today. . . .'' He said reporters sensed that he was discarding the vice presidential voice of nearly eight years, and heard his newly presidential voice ''as trying to be something they don't think I am.''</p>
        <p>''They feel a dissonance that shows up in their interpretation of what I say, how I look, my mannerisms. What they see is very different from what they're certain I am. I'm not being dishonest, though, and neither are they.</p>
        <p>''It won't stay that way, though,'' he predicted. ''Whether people who go through it admit it or not, it's a growth experience,'' he said, referring to the wild ride of a presidential run. ''It's a transformative process.''</p>
