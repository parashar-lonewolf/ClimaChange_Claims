        <p>Detox for Killer Lakes</p>

        <p>Detox for Killer Lakes</p>
        <p>In 1986, an eruption of carbon dioxide from a lake in Cameroon killed about 1,700 villagers, suffocating them under a blanket of gas. The CO2, fed into underground springs from magma miles below the surface, had accumulated deep in the lake, dissolving in the water.</p>
        <p>That cold water stayed at the bottom of the lake, trapped by a layer of warmer water. But something -- perhaps cooling of the surface waters -- caused the two layers to mix. When the gas-laden water rose, the CO2 quickly bubbled out of it in enormous quantities.</p>
        <p>Since then, gas has continued to saturate Nyos and another Cameroonian lake, Monoun, where a 1984 eruption killed 37 people. But in the last few years, scientists have devised a way to try to de-gas the lakes in a controlled way. This involves running a vertical pipe from the surface to the bottom, which brings a small but steady flow of gas-rich water to the surface, where the CO2 bubbles off.</p>
        <p>A new analysis of the work by a team of scientists including George W. Kling of the University of Michigan and William C. Evans of the United States Geological Survey, who have studied these lakes for years, demonstrates that the method -- with one pipe in each lake -- is not working well enough.</p>
        <p>The study, published in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, shows that the gas content of the lakes has been reduced by 12 to 14 percent. The layers of water are also more stable. But as more gas is removed, the process becomes less effective. The researchers estimated that in Nyos the potential for disaster will remain for decades, and in Monoun at some point the rate at which new gas enters the lake will exceed the removal rate.</p>
        <p>The solution, the scientists say, is more pipes. By adding one pipe in Monoun and four more in Nyos, they calculate, 75 to 99 percent of the gas would be removed in five years, substantially reducing the risk of another disaster.</p>
        <p>Too Many Names</p>
        <p>The system by which new species are named has worked well since it was introduced by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. Just about any name will do as long as it follows the Linnaean style and other rules established and updated by several international commissions on nomenclature.</p>
        <p>Keeping track of all those names, however, has become a real headache, particularly in zoology, with its 1.5 million animal species described so far. With the explosion of research in recent decades and the discovery of more new species (15,000 to 20,000 animal species are named every year, for example), it is difficult for biologists to keep up.</p>
        <p>Descriptions and names for new species are published in hundreds of different journals.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the Internet can bring order out of the chaos. A group of zoologists led by Andrew Polaszek, executive secretary of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, is proposing the creation of a universal Web-based registry of animal names, to be called ZooBank.</p>
        <p>Writing in Nature, the group suggests that it be made mandatory that all new species names be entered in the registry. Eventually, existing names would be entered as well. Access would be open to all, and scientists could sign up for e-mail alerts when a new species of interest to them is named.</p>
        <p>Because the registration would be accomplished by filling in Web-based forms, the registry would also help eliminate names that do not conform to the rules, a perennial problem in biological nomenclature.</p>
        <p>Winds of Mars</p>
        <p>Mars may no longer be an active volcanic planet, but it's still a happening place. Monstrous winds can spawn huge dust storms, obscuring vast swatches of territory.</p>
        <p>The winds can also create smaller changes. The Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft, for example, has spotted fresh gullies in new images compared with ones taken several years ago. They were probably formed when deposits of frozen carbon dioxide vaporized and the wind eroded the sand underneath.</p>
        <p>The images can be seen at mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/gallery/PIA04290.html.</p>
        <p>A Devil's Garden, Tended by Ants</p>
        <p>In the song ''High Hopes,'' a lowly ant moves a rubber tree. That's absurd, of course, because anyone knows an ant can't move a rubber tree plant.</p>
        <p>But in the Peruvian Amazon, there is an ant that is a remarkable landscaper. It clears out all except a single species of tree from patches of the rain forest.</p>
        <p>That's the finding of Megan E. Frederickson, a doctoral student at Stanford, who studied what are known locally as devil's gardens, areas up to about a third of an acre that are dominated almost entirely by one type of tree, D. hirsuta.</p>
        <p>Local legend has it that the patches are the work of a forest spirit. Scientists had two theories: D. hirsuta itself might be responsible, by producing a soil chemical that is toxic to other species. Or an ant that lives in tiny cavities in the trees, M. schumanni, might do the work.</p>
        <p>Ms. Frederickson's field observations showed that the ants attacked saplings of other species, injecting the leaves with formic acid. ''Not only did it seem like the ants are responsible, but they are doing it in a really fascinating manner,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Many other ant species use this chemical to kill off parasites or attackers. But M. schumanni, Ms. Frederickson said, is the first known to use the acid as an herbicide.</p>
        <p>''They actually attack plants in the same way that other ants in this family would attack another insect,'' she said. ''They grab the tissue with their mandibles, make a hole in it, stick their abdomen in and release a couple of drops.''</p>
        <p>Her experiments, described in the journal Nature, show that the saplings lose most of their leaves within five days and die within several weeks. Ms. Frederickson said it appeared that the ants used chemical cues to determine which species to attack.</p>
        <p>The behavior benefits both the D. hirsuta and M. schumanni. With no competing species, the trees get more light, nutrients and water. And as more of the trees grow and the devil's garden expands, the ants get more places to live.</p>
        <p>M. schumanni colonies can be extremely large, with a million or more workers and as many as 15,000 queens. Colonies can exist for centuries, as Ms. Frederickson discovered when she analyzed the growth rates of the 26 plots in her study. The largest one, with 351 trees, had been tended by the same ant colony for more than 800 years.</p>
