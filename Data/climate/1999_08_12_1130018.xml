        <p>THE AMERICAS</p>
        <p>VENEZUELA: SWORN IN, AGAIN  President Hugo Chavez took an oath of office for the second time in six months after the new Constitutional Assembly, packed with his supporters, ratified him in his post. Mr. Chavez placed his job at the disposal of the assembly last week in a symbolic gesture aimed at demonstrating the assembly's power. The assembly has six months to rewrite the 1961 Constitution, which Mr. Chavez argues must be scrapped to help fight corruption.</p>

        <p>GUYANA: YOUTHFUL LEADER  Bharrat Jagdeo, a 35- year-old Moscow-educated economist, was sworn in as President of Guyana, becoming the youngest head of state in the Western Hemisphere. Mr. Jagdeo, who had been Finance Minister of South America's only English-speaking country from 1995, succeeded Janet Jagan, 78, who resigned because of poor health.  (Reuters)</p>
        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>NETHERLANDS: ARTFUL DEFENSE  The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal has cut off United Nations payments for the lawyers of seven Bosnian Croats after the defendants' supporters raised $2.36 million for them at an art auction in Mostar, Bosnia, in June. The defendants, charged with atrocities against Bosnian Muslims, had been given court-funded defense attorneys when they said they could not pay for their own.</p>
        <p>(AP)</p>
        <p>SPAIN: PINOCHET SEEKS ACCESS  Lawyers for Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator, filed a motion to defend him in the Madrid court that seeks his extradition from Britain for human rights abuses. If successful, the motion would expand General Pinochet's current access to court papers in Britain -- where he is fighting extradition -- to include those in Spain, where high courts have held that defendants can have access to court papers only if they submit to Spanish justice.</p>

        <p>SRI LANKA: BOMB KILLS 9 POLICEMEN  In yet another escalation of terrorist attacks, suspected Tamil Tiger rebels killed at least nine policemen and wounded two dozen in the eastern coastal town of Batticaloa. A roadside bomb exploded as the policemen passed in a convoy of buses.</p>

        <p>INDONESIA: SECTARIAN CONFLICT  Policemen and soldiers shot at battling mobs of Muslims and Christians in the eastern island of Ambon as street fighting between the religious groups flared for a third day, witnesses said. At least 25 people have been killed in rioting since Monday in Malaku province.</p>
        <p>(AP)</p>
        <p>PAKISTAN: RALLY ALLEGES BIAS  Hundreds of Christians rallied in the capital demanding the repeal of laws they said discriminate against the country's non-Muslim minorities. These include the the 1985 blasphemy law, which sets the death penalty for those convicted of uttering insulting remarks against the Prophet Mohammed. No one has been executed under that law, but about 50 Christians are in jail facing blasphemy charges.</p>

        <p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
        <p>IRAN: CONSERVATIVE CONTROLS  Parliament upheld the right of the conservative-dominated Council of Guardians to screen all candidates for public office. The move dealt a setback to reformist supporters of President Mohammad Khatami ahead of next spring's parliamentary elections. The Council had blocked thousands of candidates, nearly all of them moderates, from running in last February's municipal elections.</p>

        <p>ISRAEL: ARAB VILLAGES CORDONED OFF  The Israeli Army sealed off several Palestinian villages in the northern West Bank after an ambush late Tuesday of an Israeli settler near the town of Jenin. Israeli military officials said they demanded help from the Palestinian police to track down the attacker. The shooting was part of a recent increase in terrorist incidents thought to be the work of radical Palestinian groups opposed to peace with Israel.</p>

        <p>LIBERIA: SECURITY CHIEF DIES IN CRASH  A small plane carrying the chief of Liberia's national police force crashed in the forests outside Monrovia, killing all six people on board. The police director, Joe Tate, a cousin of President Charles Taylor, was a leading figure in Liberian politics for years. The cause of the crash was under investigation.</p>
        <p>(AP)</p>
        <p>SOUTH AFRICA: GUN OWNERS RALLY  Chanting ''Crime control, not gun control,'' more than 1,000 mainly white gun owners marched to the gates of Parliament to protest a planned curb on firearm ownership. By some estimates there are nine million illegal guns in this country, one for every four citizens. Proposed legislation would force every gun owner to reapply for a license and undergo a mental health check. It would also restrict gun ownership to one handgun per person.</p>

        <p>ALGERIA: MILITANTS ATTACK TROOPS  Eight soldiers were killed and seven wounded in an attack by Islamic militants on the soldiers' camp 60 miles east of Algiers overnight Monday, news media reported. Violence has flared up in Algeria recently in the run-up to a Sept. 16 referendum on a partial amnesty to militants not convicted of violent crimes.</p>
        <p>(Agence France-Presse)</p>
        <p>CAMEROON: NEW TOXIC BLAST FEARED  Scientists  have warned the Government of a dangerous buildup of toxic gases beneath Lake Nyos, where 1,800 villagers died from carbon dioxide poisoning in 1986. They called for urgent steps to siphon the gas out of its depths to avert another lethal explosion. The victims of the 1986 tragedy died when carbon dioxide bubbled up from the depths of the lake and asphyxiated those living nearby.</p>
        <p>(Reuters)</p>
        <p>UNITED NATIONS</p>
        <p>UNITED NATIONS: NEW WAR CRIMES PROSECUTOR  The Security Council approved Carla del Ponte, the Swiss Attorney General, as chief prosecutor of the United Nation's international war crimes tribunals replacing Louise Arbour. In her new position, Mrs. Del Ponte will also head up the International Tribunal for Rwanda, which is based in Tanzania. Ms. Arbour will become a judge on Canada's Supreme Court.</p>
