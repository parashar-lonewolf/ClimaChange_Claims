        <p>An Ethiopian fossil hunter has found the bones and teeth of forest-dwelling creatures who lived as much as 5.8 million years ago, a discovery that appears to challenge some assumptions of early human evolution and extend knowledge of the family tree back close to its roots.</p>
        <p>The fossils are the remains of creatures who apparently walked upright. They are more than one million years older than any other fossils definitively established as those of hominids, the group of species that includes humans, their direct ancestors and close relatives.</p>
        <p>The new find, described in today's issue of the journal Nature, is especially intriguing to paleontologists because the bones appear to be so primitive and apelike and their ages, 5.2 million to 5.8 million years old, put them close to the fateful evolutionary split between the lineage leading to modern humans and the one that produced chimpanzees. Molecular biological studies indicate that the divergence occurred 5.5 million to 6.5 million years ago.</p>
        <p>Of particular importance, experts on human origins say, is the evidence that these early hominids lived in a relatively wet and cool forest because the prevailing theory had been that hominids evolved in grasslands after forests disappeared. The forest was a hostile environment of shifting terrain, exploding volcanoes and menacing lava flows.</p>
        <p>In the journal report, the scientist -- Yohannes Haile-Selassie, a doctoral candidate in paleontology at the University of California at Berkeley -- said the state of development of the fossil teeth included strong clues that the individuals were indeed hominids. And a toe bone, he said, provided evidence that the creature was ''a biped when on the ground.''</p>
        <p>But the presence of primitive dental and bone characteristics, Mr. Haile-Selassie said, indicated that the species ''was phylogenetically close to the common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans.''</p>
        <p>Dr. C. Owen Lovejoy, a paleontologist at Kent State University in Ohio who has examined the fossils, said that he was ''in full overall agreement'' with the interpretations of Mr. Haile-Selassie and other members of the research project.</p>
        <p>Speaking of the relationship between the ancestors of humans and chimpanzees, called pongids, Dr. Lovejoy said: ''We are indeed coming very close to that point in the fossil record where we simply will not be able to distinguish ancestral hominids from ancestral pongids because they were so anatomically similar. We are now very close to the origin of hominids.''</p>
        <p>Working with Dr. Tim D. White of Berkeley, one of the most experienced hominid hunters, Mr. Haile-Selassie and colleagues found the fossils in the Middle Awash River Valley badlands of Ethiopia, about 50 miles from where the ''Lucy'' skeleton, which is 3.2 million years old, was uncovered 30 years ago. The new find includes 11 specimens, including a jawbone with teeth, hand and foot bones, fragments of arm bones and a piece of collarbone. They represent at least five individuals.</p>
        <p>Dr. White said an accurate portrayal of these creatures was not yet possible because an intact skull or limb bones had not been found. The size of the lower jaw and some bones of the skeleton suggests that one of these individuals was about the size of a modern chimpanzee.</p>
        <p>Until more diagnostic specimens are found, preferably including a skull, the fossils have been tentatively classified as a primitive subspecies, Ardipithecus ramidus kadabba. Kadabba means ''basal family ancestor'' in the local language, Afar. The ramidus species was discovered in 1994 in 4.4-million-year-old sediments, also in Ethiopia.</p>
        <p>The evidence that these creatures lived in forests, as opposed to grasslands, is especially intriguing to scientist.</p>
        <p>In a separate report on the environmental history of the discovery site, Dr. Giday WoldeGabriel, a geologist at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, and his colleagues concluded that it ''seems increasingly likely that early hominids did not frequent open habitats'' until after 4.4 million years ago. The Ardipithecus hominids at that time also appeared to live in woodlands.</p>
        <p>Dr. Stanley H. Ambrose, an anthropologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana, analyzed the chemistry of ancient soil mixed with the fossils. ''The expectation was that we would find hominids in savanna grassland sites that date back to about eight million years ago, but that hasn't happened,'' Dr. Ambrose said. ''All older hominids have been found in forested environments.''</p>
        <p>In that case, the development of upright walking, considered a definitive characteristic of hominids, presumably occurred in a wooded habitat and not as an adaptation to life on the treeless savanna, as had been supposed. Dr. WoldeGabriel's team said the new findings required ''a fundamental reassessment'' of favored theoretical models ''that invoke a significant role for global climate change and/or savanna habitat in the origin of hominids.''</p>
        <p>Calling this ''a very dramatic development in terms of our knowledge of bipedality in hominids and apes,'' Dr. Lovejoy said in an interview that the evidence tended ''to falsify many previous hypotheses that related the development of both hominids and bipedality to an occupation of savannas.''</p>
        <p>The announcement of the discovery capped a recent winning streak in hominid research. In March, Dr. Meave G. Leakey announced the discovery of a 3.5-million-year-old skull in Kenya. Named Kenyanthropus platyops, this hominid appears to be an entirely new branch of the family tree, and one more likely than the Lucy species to be a direct ancestor of humans.</p>
        <p>In February, a group led by Dr. Brigitte Senut of the National Museum of Natural History in Paris and Dr. Martin Pickford of the Collège de France reported finding fossils of a new species, Orrorin tugenensis, in Kenya. The discoverers said the fossils were six million years old and thus represented the earliest hominid. But other scientists, including researchers involved with the new Ethiopian find, want to see more evidence before accepting that assessment. Some of them question whether Orrorin is a hominid.</p>
        <p>In the journal report, Mr. Haile-Selassie noted that the Orrorin teeth were ''quite primitive.'' He added that ''the locomotor anatomy of Orrorin remains uncertain,'' meaning that its ability to walk upright has yet to be established.</p>
        <p>Consequently, until more information is available, Mr. Haile-Selassie said that Orrorin could fill any one of several places in the fossil record. It could be the last common ancestor of the hominid and chimpanzee lines, the earliest hominid, the earliest chimpanzee or an ape that eventually became extinct.</p>
        <p>Despite the controversy and uncertainty over the relationship between Orrorin and the new fossils, Dr. White said in an e-mail interview from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia: ''Less than a year ago, it was a black hole beyond 4.4 million years. Now we're nearly to 6 million. That's one giant leap for human paleontology, however these fossils ultimately end up relating to each other.''</p>
