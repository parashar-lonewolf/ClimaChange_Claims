        <p>Bess Clemens leaves the business of baseball to her son. For her, there is only one side in his coming contract negotiation. Forget luxury taxes and payroll restraints. The team that signs her youngest son, Roger, will be lucky, indeed.</p>
        <p>''She knows wherever I'm going, they're going to get a good, quality pitcher and a guy that knows what he's doing,'' Roger Clemens said today in an interview at his home. ''She knows that. Their loss is the next guy's gain, that's the way she looks at it. She knows I'm ready. She just wants to know how my body feels.''</p>
        <p>His 40-year-old body feels terrific. Just this morning, Clemens worked out here with his personal trainer and Justin Thompson, the former Detroit Tigers pitcher. The Yankees' Andy Pettitte and the Cardinals' Woody Williams will be stopping by any day.</p>
        <p>Clemens is more concerned with the health of his mother, who is 72 and has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or C.O.P.D., the umbrella term for chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Clemens has joined the United States C.O.P.D. Coalition, working to raise awareness of a disease that afflicts 16 million Americans.</p>
        <p>His career may end after this season, and Clemens will enter the Hall of Fame on the first ballot. His mother raised six children after her husband died when Roger was 9 years old, and Clemens credits her with his intensity and strong will. He wants her to make it to Cooperstown with him.</p>
        <p>''I want her to hang on through this disease that she has, this illness, and make it to that point,'' Clemens said. ''There's an urgency there of some sort.''</p>
        <p>That is the only urgency Clemens projected today, in an hourlong interview on the terrace outside the den of his home in a wooded, quiet cul-de-sac.</p>
        <p>He is a free agent after collecting a $10.3 million buyout on his Yankees contract. He is 7 victories short of 300 for his career, and the teams interested in him say they are constrained by payroll limitations. But Clemens is relaxed, unswerving in his desire to remain a top pitcher and confident he still is one.</p>
        <p>''I've played with guys on the baseball field, and they're happy making 2 or 3 million,'' Clemens said. ''There's nothing wrong with that. That's a lot of money; I've never lost sight of what's a lot of money. And that's great, but they could be a 10 or 15 guy if they really wanted to.''</p>
        <p>Clemens was 13-6 with a 4.35 earned run average last season. He still sees himself as an ace, and the Yankees treated him that way, starting him in the playoff opener.</p>
        <p>He was going to earn $10.3 million this season whether he played or not, and it was always understood he would take the money as a buyout and not a 2003 salary. His next contract will be a fresh start, and Clemens gave no indications he would accept a discount to stay with the Yankees.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't matter how much you've earned,'' Clemens said. ''There's creative ways to do things. I still find it humorous when I get a comment or two from guys in New York that I'm getting paid this year for not playing. That money's already been earned. I deferred that to help the Yankees out. Regardless of whether I play or not, that's a whole other issue. I'm not really concerned about it either way.</p>
        <p>''I know I'm going to play, I know I'm going to chase down 300, and I know whoever I'm with, we're going to be trying to win a championship. Having said that, I don't know what the Yankees' plans are. We haven't heard from the Yankees.</p>
        <p>''I'm just going to kick back and look at my options and see what they want. There are other free-agent pitchers out there, too. Whatever team I'm with, I'm going to be making a great contribution and a big impact on it.''</p>
        <p>Clemens has been a leader on a staff of established starters, and he wants to keep pitching for a team with a deep rotation.</p>
        <p>''If I move on, I want to be in a place where I'm going to win,'' he said. ''I want to have a big staff. I want to pitch with a lot of guys that have a chance to win. That's the only reason to play, is to have a chance to win.''</p>
        <p>Clemens has done that since joining the Yankees in 1999. He is 60-27 for them, with a Cy Young award and two World Series rings. At his home, the reminders are everywhere.</p>
        <p>An oil painting of Clemens in a Yankee uniform sits on an easel in his bedroom. A Yankees flag hangs near a side door. Dozens of pinstriped bobblehead dolls sit on a counter in the garage, out of their boxes and bunched together. There is a book about Babe Ruth in the bathroom, a framed photo of George Steinbrenner in the den.</p>
        <p>Clemens wants to stay with the Yankees, and though General Manager Brian Cashman wants him back, Steinbrenner, the principal owner, has ordered Cashman to cut payroll because of the taxes imposed by the new labor agreement. One baseball official has said that if Clemens wants $10 million or more, the Yankees cannot afford him.</p>
        <p>Clemens, who expects to see Steinbrenner at some point this off-season, whether or not he returns, maintains his faith in the Yankees' boss.</p>
        <p>''This new agreement is really directed at the Yankees, where the taxes are going to kill this man,'' Clemens said.</p>
        <p>''George is going to go out and find a way. Because he's a great businessman and he loves what he does, he's going to go out and find the means to make another 50 or 60 million somewhere.''</p>
        <p>Presumably, some of that extra income would go to Clemens. But there is also Pettitte, a left-hander who is 10 years younger and will become a free agent if the Yankees do not pick up his $11.5 million option -- or sign him to an extension with a lower base salary -- by Friday.</p>
        <p>Though the Yankees have four other starters under contract -- five, including Sterling Hitchcock -- Clemens said he is not concerned that the Yankees may have to choose between keeping him or Pettitte. But the two friends are curious.</p>
        <p>''I talked to him this morning, and he's kind of in the same situation that I'm in,'' Clemens said, referring to Pettitte. ''We're just waiting to hear.''</p>
        <p>While he waits, Clemens campaigns. He will be in Washington next week to formally announce his involvement with C.O.P.D., a disease characterized by a decrease in the lungs' ability to maintain oxygen and remove carbon dioxide. It is almost always caused by smoking.</p>
        <p>Bess Clemens smoked for more than 40 years until she was found to have emphysema in 1993. She quit on the spot.</p>
        <p>''I could either smoke or I could breathe,'' she said in a telephone interview today. ''Those were my two choices. I had to choose one. By the time I was diagnosed, I was well into mine. People don't realize that they have this. It creeps up on you, little by little.''</p>
        <p>At least once a month, Clemens said, he will get a call from a sister on a day he is pitching, telling him their mother has had a bad day or is in the hospital. She often needs a small oxygen tube to help her breathe and sometimes relies on a wheelchair to get around.</p>
        <p>Clemens, who hopes to spread awareness of the disease and encourage young people not to smoke, continues to draw from his mother's courage. He has always followed her example.</p>
        <p>Bess Clemens worked three jobs to raise her family, and when her youngest son was a teenager, he sometimes helped her stack items on grocery store shelves at night. He believes the work ethic he got from her is the biggest reason for his success.</p>
        <p>Clemens will be rewarded for that work when he wins his 300th game. He does not know what uniform he will be wearing; the Yankees, Texas Rangers, Houston Astros and Boston Red Sox all have payroll constraints. But he knows who will be there to see it.</p>
        <p>Good day or bad, Bess Clemens will be in the stands. ''I've always told him, 'I'll be there, Roger,' '' she said. ''There are some times you just don't let your kids down. You make that extra effort, because they want you there.''</p>
