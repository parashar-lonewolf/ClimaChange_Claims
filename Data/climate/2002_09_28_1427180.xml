        <p>The Pataki administration said yesterday that it would require the construction equipment at the World Trade Center site to adhere to strict air pollution controls -- a move that environmentalists and Democrats had called for all year.</p>
        <p>Diesel-powered construction machinery like cranes, backhoes and bulldozers put out many times more pollution, per gallon of fuel burned, than diesel trucks or, in many cases, power plants that burn diesel oil. The State Department of Environmental Conservation said yesterday that it would order government agencies and private contractors to take steps to reduce some emissions by well over 99 percent, through the use of ultralow-sulfur diesel fuel, for example, and emission controls like particle traps and catalytic converters in exhaust systems.</p>

        <p>The Pataki administration said yesterday that it would require the construction equipment at the World Trade Center site to adhere to strict air pollution controls -- a move that environmentalists and Democrats had called for all year.</p>
        <p>Diesel-powered construction machinery like cranes, backhoes and bulldozers put out many times more pollution, per gallon of fuel burned, than diesel trucks or, in many cases, power plants that burn diesel oil. The State Department of Environmental Conservation said yesterday that it would order government agencies and private contractors to take steps to reduce some emissions by well over 99 percent, through the use of ultralow-sulfur diesel fuel, for example, and emission controls like particle traps and catalytic converters in exhaust systems.</p>
        <p>''The steps that New York is committing to now are going to make the Lower Manhattan reconstruction a national model of clean construction techniques,'' said Andrew Darrell, New York regional director of Environmental Defense, one of the groups that had pushed Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, to adopt the rules. He said similar rules had been adopted for only a few other projects around the country.</p>
        <p>Sheldon Silver, the Democratic Assembly speaker, said that he and others had asked the governor to take these steps at the beginning of the year, and that an opportunity had been missed to prevent significant pollution during the digging-out phase of the recovery. ''While I am pleased that the governor has finally taken action, I cannot understand why it took him so long to take this step to protect the health of those who live, work and attend school in Lower Manhattan,'' Mr. Silver said.</p>
        <p>The fuel requirement will be phased in over a few weeks, officials said, while the emission controls are likely to take a bit longer. Some construction is under way at the trade center site, particularly on transit lines, but other activity is at a lull now.</p>
        <p>''These kinds of heavy diesels emit more fine particulate matter than cars, trucks and power plants combined,'' Mr. Darrell said.</p>
        <p>Under federal regulations, the diesel fuel sold for vehicles used mostly on roads cannot contain more than 500 parts per million of sulfur. But the fuel for construction equipment and other nonroad diesels can be as high as 5,000 parts.</p>
        <p>The Pataki administration will require that the machinery at the trade center site burn diesel with just 15 to 30 parts per million of sulfur.</p>
        <p>Sulfur is the main source of particulate pollution, or soot, that contributes to asthma and other lung diseases, and it is a major contributor to acid rain. The smokestack controls will reduce both soot and nitrogen oxides, major sources of smog and acid rain.</p>
