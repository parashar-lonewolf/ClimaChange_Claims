        <p>THE first stage in developing a full-scale wine region in Long Island was the creation of still wine. In a second stage, a handful of estates added sparkling wine to their portfolios. Now a third stage has begun to unfold: A producer is specializing exclusively in sparkling wine.</p>
        <p>Using 2004 grapes, the new producer, Sparkling Pointe, has made chardonnay and pinot noir wines from fruit bought from Mudd's Vineyard in Southold.</p>
        <p>The wines are intended for the producer's first round of sparkling wine. Having completed fermentation, they are turning clear in stainless steel vats at the Premium Wine Group in Mattituck.</p>
        <p>After being bottled and sealed temporarily, blended and unblended base wines will lie in the Premium Wine Group's chill cellar and undergo a secondary fermentation, during which carbon dioxide bubbles are created, until the winemaker decides to disgorge the dead yeast cells in preparation for release and sale.</p>
        <p>In wine industry lingo, Premium is a custom-crush winery; growers who want to produce their own wines without the cost of building and equipping a winery can contract for its services and provide their own winemaker.</p>
        <p>The owners of Sparkling Pointe are Tom and Cynthia Rosicki, both lawyers in Muttontown. They expect to start planting their 12-acre property on Route 48 in Southold in the spring, according to Gilles Martin, who is their consulting winemaker.</p>
        <p>The Rosickis have hired Steve Mudd of Mudd's Vineyard to plant chardonnay, pinot noir and pinot meunier vines on the property, which has been uprooted, plowed and fertilized. The site was formerly Akscin's Nursery.</p>
        <p>Sparkling Pointe's first bottlings (from purchased grapes) are likely to emerge in 2007 or 2008, said the French-born Mr. Martin. He is the full-time winemaker for Martha Clara in Riverhead, which makes all its wines, including sparkling wines, at the Premium Wine Group.</p>
        <p>Mr. Martin said Sparkling Pointe was estimating a first round of 1,000 12-bottle cases: at least a brut and possibly a blanc de blancs -- a white wine 100 percent made from chardonnay grapes.</p>
        <p>The creation of a cuv√©e, or blend, might start in February or March, and first-stage bottling might start in May or June. But first Mr. and Mrs. Rosicki must decide on a style of sparkling wine.</p>
        <p>''I want people I work for to have the style they want,'' Mr. Martin said. ''We have already begun tasting. I will design a couple of different styles for them.''</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Martin's nonvintage brut made from estate-grown 2000 grapes (63 percent chardonnay, 37 percent pinot noir) is sold out at Martha Clara's tasting room, it possibly yielded clues to Sparkling Pointe's opening style. It was Gallic, graceful and refreshing. I have not yet tasted the sparkling wine made from 2001 grapes.</p>
