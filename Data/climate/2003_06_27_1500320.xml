      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Gov. John Baldacci signed legislation that requires the state to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by 2010, and an additional 10 percent by 2020, making Maine the first state to pass a comprehensive law addressing global warming. The legislation is one of a number of state-level climate change initiatives that have emerged since the United States pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol. Maine officials said they were motivated partly by evidence that climate change might already be affecting the state's environment. According to the federal Environmental Protection Agency, the average temperature in Lewiston has risen by 3.4 degrees in the past century, and rainfall has fallen by up to 20 percent in many parts of the state.</p>
