        <p>DURING the holidays, why do millions of people the world over gather around dead trees to celebrate life? In nature-loving societies, the ritual seems a bit weird.</p>
        <p>From the moment the colonists first stepped ashore, America's relationship with its trees has evolved in a peculiar way: we started as mighty tree slayers and have since reverted -- in the suburbs at least -- to virtual arboreal valets, calling in the medics at the slightest sign of a cavity in the base of a noble trunk. That's quite a turnabout from the 1600's, when settlers eagerly deforested the Eastern seaboard to make way for crops. As they moved west, the pioneers mythologized tree wranglers like Paul Bunyan.

        <p>DURING the holidays, why do millions of people the world over gather around dead trees to celebrate life? In nature-loving societies, the ritual seems a bit weird.</p>
        <p>From the moment the colonists first stepped ashore, America's relationship with its trees has evolved in a peculiar way: we started as mighty tree slayers and have since reverted -- in the suburbs at least -- to virtual arboreal valets, calling in the medics at the slightest sign of a cavity in the base of a noble trunk. That's quite a turnabout from the 1600's, when settlers eagerly deforested the Eastern seaboard to make way for crops. As they moved west, the pioneers mythologized tree wranglers like Paul Bunyan. One of the most stirring moments in the movie ''Shane'' is when the pioneers take axes to a tree stump to clear a field.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the last popular vision of America as an off-with-their-branches society was when Dorothy got slapped by those trees for reaching for one of their apples. In 1939, Eden looked a lot more like the Emerald City than a forest.</p>
        <p>But now North Americans have rediscovered their inner druids, and at least for most of the year we can't get enough of trees. Central Park is a ravishing arboretum with rare species lovingly hung with identifying plaques, while in the suburbs humans insist on living closer to very large trees than is strictly advisable. We fight to save trees in South American forests and old growth stands in North America. In fact, we fight for trees just about everywhere -- except on Christmas tree farms.</p>
        <p>The Christmas tree is not only lovely, but may be an anxiety-relief valve. Homo sapiens, in its collective unconscious, has always apprehended the dark potential of xylem and phloem. Civilizations from the Egyptians to the Romans to the Vikings celebrated the winter solstice by bringing palm leaves, pine boughs and other greenery into their homes to ensure that the sun gods would recover from their illnesses and return to shine.</p>
        <p>A more recent tradition is the Yule log, which had to be the central trunk of a great tree dragged from the forest; its burning involved many obeisances or else the owner's house could be struck by lightning.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the poet William Carlos Williams recognized the fear underlying these rites when he wrote, in ''Burning the Christmas Greens'':</p>
        <p>Their time past, pulled down</p>
        <p>cracked and flung to the fire</p>
        <p>--go up in a roar</p>
        <p>All recognition lost, burnt clean</p>
        <p>clean in the flame, the green</p>
        <p>dispersed, a living red</p>
        <p>flame red, red as blood wakes</p>
        <p>on the ash.</p>
        <p>Even as trees dutifully absorb the planet's carbon dioxide and give back life-giving oxygen, there may be a primordial need, as the poet suggests, to assert control over them. Trees, after all, are extremely effective accomplices in wreaking destruction, and the urge to saw may be particularly strong this year, as the nation's trees have morphed into malefactors from coast to coast. First there was the havoc caused by Hurricane Isabel, when falling trees killed 10 people, crushed homes and cars, and caused widespread power failures. (Innocent-looking trees that suddenly keel over or drop a limb several days after a storm or fire are known as ''widow makers.'')</p>
        <p>Then Southern California was ravaged by wildfires that killed at least 13 people. During the blazes, Senator Dianne Feinstein stressed the need to address the ''wildland/urban interface,'' which is really a polite way of describing the phenomenon of humans living near Big Woods that can destroy their homes.</p>
        <p>So what to do?</p>
        <p>Pull out the chainsaw and take down the beech in the backyard with the swing hanging from it? Uproot the 100-year-old oaks in the local park? Of course not. Better to stuff a Scotch pine into our apartments and houses.</p>
        <p>Whether we chop them ourselves or by proxy, we are undeniably committing murder. Many of us feel conflicted about it, but we do it anyway.</p>
        <p>The president illuminates a giant dead tree next to his house every December, and millions gaze at the Rockefeller Center tree without evincing the slightest bit of guilt about the torture inflicted on this gargantuan beauty. In a telling euphemism, a New York tourism Web site claims that the 79-foot prize has been ''freed'' and carried to its new home above the ice rink.</p>
        <p>Freed? How about chopped down, trussed, lashed to a flatbed truck and hauled into a concrete prison for the edification of the urban multitudes. The whole spectacle echoes ancient Rome, when a victorious general would parade his new slaves in chains through the streets.</p>
        <p>As we fling wads of tinsel onto Douglas firs, not many of us would confess to the motive of enslavement. We say we are enjoying the beauty of the tree, water it dutifully and do not articulate the subconscious feeling of relief.</p>
        <p>Outdoors, the plant world's chieftains -- the enormous oaks and beeches and palms -- are ever ready to act on nature's orders and become seven-ton battering rams or tinderboxes. But inside the living room, we can take comfort from the little tree in the corner, so securely bound in its metal stand and chains of light.</p>
        <p>This is one tree that can't hurt us. Maybe that's why we love the smell of resin in the morning. It smells like victory.</p>
