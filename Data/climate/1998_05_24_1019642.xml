        <p>Jonathan Lethem has no patience for rigid genre boundaries. His recent novel ''Gun, With Occasional Music'' (1995) mixed noirish detective fiction a la Raymond Chandler with near-future science fiction to produce an entertainment of delicious irrelevance.

        <p>Jonathan Lethem has no patience for rigid genre boundaries. His recent novel ''Gun, With Occasional Music'' (1995) mixed noirish detective fiction a la Raymond Chandler with near-future science fiction to produce an entertainment of delicious irrelevance. GIRL IN LANDSCAPE (Doubleday, $22.95) marries science fiction and the western, but this time around Lethem is deadly serious.</p>
        <p>Pella Marsh, 14, is a survivor. Her mother dies just before her family moves to a distant planet inhabited by enigmatic aliens known as Archbuilders. Her father, a failed politician back home in Brooklyn, cannot adjust to the new world, leaving Pella and her two younger brothers to fend for themselves in the little unnamed settlement beneath a vast ''peach-hued'' sky.</p>
        <p>Food is no problem; edible roots, gene-engineered by the Archbuilders' ancestors, are available everywhere for the digging. The aliens, who appear content to live off the land their forebears tamed with benign ''viruses,'' are if anything too friendly; their unquenchable curiosity about everything human strikes some settlers as suspicious. The real challenge for Pella is surviving the disintegration of her family while coming of age as a woman. When she discovers the aliens' method of spying on the settlers, she cannot resist the temptation to peer behind the masks that adults wear to hide their own fears and desires.</p>
        <p>I wish I could report that Lethem handles this material with the same bracing confidence that he brought to ''Gun, With Occasional Music.'' But Pella's involvement with a macho character out of a John Wayne western seems strained, the product not of her own needs but of the author's determination to reinvent this backward-looking genre in a science fictional framework.</p>
        <p>Even so, there is much to admire in ''Girl in Landscape,'' not least the opening section in which a still-intact Marsh family goes to Coney Island for one last terrestrial outing beneath a sun turned deadly by the depletion of Earth's ozone layer.</p>
        <p>Felicitas, the 17-year-old heroine of OUTPOST (Tor/Tom Doherty, $24.95), by Scott Mackay, is a prisoner in a maximum-security prison. Like her fellow prisoners, she cannot remember what she has done to deserve incarceration in the vast stone-walled institution run by insensate machines so old they have begun to wear out. While some prisoners look for ways to escape, others seem permanently brain-deadened by their encounters with the ''dreamphones'' that descend from the ceilings of their cells every night.</p>
        <p>As Felicitas emerges from her amnesia, she realizes that the breakdown of the machines is a mixed blessing. With the mechanical guards and the dreamphones inoperative, escape now seems possible; but the food machines have also stopped functioning, and the prisoners must find a way over the walls before they starve to death.</p>
        <p>Like a few of her comrades, Felicitas experiences visions from time to time that hint at the prison's role in a far larger drama, one that involves contending camps of alien time travelers in a struggle whose outcome will determine the fate of all life in the universe.</p>
        <p>By grounding this struggle in the agonizing details of the prisoners' search for food and freedom, Mackay avoids the grandiosity that is an occupational hazard of science fiction writers who dabble in cosmic themes. The solution to the mystery of the prison is as implausible as it is provocative. If you could save entire civilizations from extinction by wiping from humanity's collective memory a single book, would you do it? And which book would you delete?</p>
        <p>The fate of the universe is also at stake in Eric S. Nylund's SIGNAL TO NOISE (Avon, $23). Jack Potter, a whiz at computer cryptography, lives in a near-future United States that has endured the loss of San Francisco and Los Angeles to an earthquake-induced tidal wave. A successful player in the dog-eat-dog society that survived this disaster, Jack discovers in seemingly random interstellar noise the unmistakable signature of an alien civilization.</p>
        <p>The aliens he gets in touch with are interested in trading information. The first trade that Jack engineers makes him and a few chosen colleagues rich and powerful beyond their dreams. It soon becomes apparent that trading with the aliens is not for the faint of heart: their version of dog-eat-dog competition involves gobbling up and spitting out entire planetary systems. Can Jack and his friends stop them? Do they want to? And who are his friends anyway?</p>
        <p>Answering these questions might have made for a refreshingly cynical take on science fiction's traditional theme of ''first contact.'' Unfortunately, Nylund seems to have borrowed his narrative strategy from the slash-and-burn video games that mesmerize adolescent boys. Each time that Jack, whose powers increasingly resemble those of comic-book superheroes, parries a threat from space, he is forced to go to another level of difficulty. By the time he has finished saving the world, virtually everyone on Earth is dead. But not to worry. Gathering a small band of survivors around him, Jack takes the long view: ''If humans were destined to trade and make deals . . . then humans belonged out there, among the stars. Where the action was.''</p>
        <p>Paul J. McAuley's CHILD OF THE RIVER (Avon, $14) is subtitled ''The First Book of Confluence.'' It tells the story of Yama, a young man of uncertain birth and vast, if unpredictable, powers. His caste-ridden world, called Confluence, harbors a strange mix of prescientific and technologically advanced elements. An established religion centered on powerful but long absent beings called the Preservers is threatened by a heretical rebellion of uncertain origin. The shrines where ''avatars of the Preservers'' once spoke to believers have fallen silent. Yama wakes one, only to hear a message about his destiny that he refuses to accept.</p>
        <p>If all this begins to sound familiar, you are probably acquainted with the work of Gene Wolfe, who made such memorable use of mixed-technology cultures and religions based on (or distorted from) a scientifically advanced past in his two major series of novels, ''The Book of the New Sun'' and ''The Book of the Long Sun.'' Why McAuley, a fine stylist in his own right, has chosen to pay so slavish a homage to Wolfe is not clear. Of course, all these narrative elements are in the public domain, and McAuley, author of acclaimed novels like ''Four Hundred Billion Stars'' and ''Red Dust,'' has certainly earned the right to put his personal stamp on them. I look forward to seeing how he and Yama fare in the next volume of this series.</p>
