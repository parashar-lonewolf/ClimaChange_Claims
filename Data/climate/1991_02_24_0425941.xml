        <p>To cope with the problem of global warming, the University of Iowa has formed an interdisciplinary Center for Global and Regional Environmental Research, encompassing 15 of its academic departments.</p>
        <p>The center's co-director, Jerald Schnorr, a professor in environmental engineering, says he believes it is the first such consortium in the nation to focus on regional climate, the level at which public policy can be enacted.</p>
        <p>Professor Schnorr, who recently edited a series of reports on the Exxon Valdez oil spill for a publication of the American Chemical Society, said an interdisciplinary approach makes sense because climate change in the Upper Midwest does not fit neatly into a single discipline.</p>
        <p>"If we don't form interdisciplinary centers like this one, we will fail to address the critical and emerging needs of society," he said.</p>
        <p>The center consists of 34 faculty members, but its flow chart does not show departmental affiliations. "Problems such as global change are hindered by our disciplinary barriers," Professor Schnorr said. "If the various disciplines aren't talking, I think they miss part of the story." Geology and Geography</p>
        <p>For some, the exchange has already paid off in new ideas and methodologies.</p>
        <p>George Baker, a geology professor, researches climate history by studying the remains of vegetation. Through the center he learned of a professor in geography who constructed computer models of climate and vegetation.</p>
        <p>By combining their work, the two scholars were able to work backward and determine what the climate was like 5,000 to 6,000 years ago. That, in turn, will help determine whether current climatic changes are part of a normal cycle or were a result of human activity.</p>
        <p>"Probably neither one of us would have thought of that on our own," Professor Baker said.</p>
        <p>A professor and hydrology engineer, Witold Krajewski, said his involvement with the center "has given me new ammunition to appeal to students to broaden their horizons beyond engineering."</p>
        <p>"It is appealing to students to see the strong connection between science and engineering," Professor Krajewski said.  'The Big Picture'</p>
        <p>The opportunity to expand beyond a single field of study has attracted some graduate students to the university. Kurt Paterson, a doctoral candidate in environmental engineering from Davenport, Iowa, who is studying regional climate change, turned down an offer from a larger institution because it asked him to narrow his research interests.</p>
        <p>"I had trouble finding one narrow topic that I felt I could really be interested in for the rest of my life," Mr. Paterson said. The chance to study outside the environmental engineering department, in fields as diverse as biology, chemistry and law, he said, gives him "a feel for the big picture."</p>
        <p>Another doctoral candidate in environmental engineering, Todd Reese of Des Moines, said he believed that interdisciplinary centers like Iowa's would become increasingly popular, in part because of the opportunities that they offer researchers. Can Attract Funds</p>
        <p>"Money's tight," Mr. Reese said. "Centers are big. They're good for young investigators who need a start and have good ideas that are difficult to fund, and they're good for the Federal Government that wants to streamline some of its operations."</p>
        <p>But Teri Camery, a general studies junior from Atlantic, Iowa, who is studying the environment, worries that the center diverts too many resources from educating students.</p>
        <p>"The center is another example of their having all this for research," she said. "Why can't they give some of it back to the students?"</p>
        <p>As vice president of the University of Iowa's Environmental Coalition, Ms. Camery undertook a campaign to establish an interdisciplinary undergraduate degree in environmental studies but she said she had found that environmental classes had been cut from the curriculum, partly because of a lack of faculty time. "The more time the teachers have to do research, the less time they have to teach," she said.</p>
        <p>Iowa offers degrees in environmental studies through its geology and geography departments, but Ms. Camery seeks an interdisciplinary degree that incorporates political science and economics. Arose From Conference</p>
        <p>"There's no way you can implement scientific solutions to environmental problems without a broad understanding of the problems that caused them," she said.</p>
        <p>The center recognizes this and so have faculty members who study public policy, like David J. Forkenbrook, director of Iowa's Public Policy Center who was a co-founder of the interdisciplinary group.</p>
        <p>The center grew out of a 1989 conference on climate change sponsored by Professors Forkenbrook and Schnorr and by Gregory R. Carmichael, a chemical-biochemical engineering professor.</p>
        <p>The same year, Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa, as head of the National Governors' Association, proposed an initiative to study the issue and its possible effect on the region's economy. A tax on utilities that was enacted last June is expected to bring the center its first financing this July, about $325,000.</p>
