        <p>INVENTORS, scientists and entrepreneurs are racing to perfect innovative ways of extinguishing the fires that have turned Kuwaiti oil fields into raging infernos.</p>
        <p>Some of the would-be firefighters are eager for lucrative pay, while others, including at least one Nobel laureate, want to stem ecological damage. All are certain that traditional methods will fail to rapidly extinguish the flames that thunder atop hundreds of wells in the worst oil conflagration of all time.</p>
        <p>The first of Kuwait's oil-well fires, a relatively small one, was extinguished yesterday with an experimental method more than five weeks after the war ended. Bigger fires may be harder to quench. Moreover, experts agree that putting out flames is only half the battle; flowing wells must then be capped.</p>
        <p>The new ideas include robots that launch flame-eating chemicals, portable factories that spew super-cold foams, air guns that cut through wreckage around wells, explosive charges that seal oil pipes and 100-ton concrete caps that snuff out flames hundreds of feet high. The last two ideas are seen as especially attractive since they would simultaneously stop the gush of uncontrolled oil.</p>
        <p>A deadly prerequisite is also being addressed: how to rapidly find and remove thousands of land mines scattered by Iraqi troops.</p>
        <p>The new firefighting ideas are being discussed at scientific meetings, in patent filings and in the back rooms of new businesses. Some are shrouded in secrecy in the expectation of colossal profits.</p>
        <p>Kuwaiti officials, eager to end the loss of millions of barrels of oil a day from what they estimate to be 520 burning wells, say they are scouring the world for innovative solutions.</p>
        <p>"We are keen to look into these ideas and translate them into strategies for the firefighters," Mustafa al-Adsani, manager of operations for the Kuwait Oil Company, said in an interview last week after attending a two-day meeting in Washington.</p>
        <p>Sponsored by the Union of Concerned Scientists, a private group based in Cambridge, Mass., the meeting brought together dozens of prominent experts to find ways to speed the firefighting, which would take two to five years if limited to the usual techniques.</p>
        <p>"We hope to truncate that," said Dr. Henry W. Kendall, a Nobel laureate in physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who helped organize the meeting.</p>
        <p>"This fire is the largest artificial one that has ever been set. It will have grave costs for health and the environment. Those clouds of acrid smoke are carcinogenic. On top of that, there's an immense financial cost, approaching $100 million a day. There's every reason to bring that in check as briskly as one can."</p>
        <p>The Federal Government is also searching for solutions. Last week in Houston, the Department of Energy sponsored a closed meeting in which oil industry experts and top scientists from around the nation exchanged firefighting ideas.</p>
        <p>Representative Curt Weldon, a Pennsylvania Republican who heads the Congressional Fire Caucus and recently returned from Kuwait, says he is trying to prod the Federal Government, including the military, into accelerated action.  Danger and Romance</p>
        <p>"You can't appreciate the immensity of the problem unless you go over there and drive through the oil fields at noon with your headlights on," he said in an interview.</p>
        <p>In Kuwait, where towering flames cast an eerie orange light and spew clouds of choking black smoke, the traditional approach to firefighting is being pursued by a handful of American companies that have built up considerable expertise and reputations. They include the Red Adair Company Inc., Wild Well Control Inc. and Boots &amp; Coots Inc., all based in Houston.</p>
        <p>The rough-and-tumble Texans exult in the danger and romance of their jobs. Mr. Adair, 78 years old, is a legendary figure who inspired the 1969 movie "Hellfighters," starring John Wayne.</p>
        <p>The usual method starts with huge volumes of water to cool the area around a burning well and the welter of pipes near its center, which in Kuwait have often been torn by explosions. The desert sand near a burning well often has melted into glass. The water not only makes the area more endurable for manned operations but also insures that none of the twisted metal wreckage will be hot enough to re-ignite oil and gas once a fire is extinguished.</p>
        <p>After a site is cooled, a firefighter driving a tractor equipped with a long arm moves in with a giant explosive charge, places it near the flame, jumps off and runs as the ensuing detonation robs the fire of oxygen.</p>
        <p>"It blows it out like a candle," said Charles L. Page, head of fire protection training at the Texas Engineering Extension Service, based at Texas A &amp; M University.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, when a fire burns deep underground, a new well will often be drilled to redirect the oil or cut it off. These so-called relief wells can take a month or more to drill. 'A Lot of Theatrics'</p>
        <p>The Texas firefighters are said by their high-tech rivals to have a general disdain for new techniques, preferring to stick with proven methods. This conservatism has been criticized by some of the field's new entrants, who also fault what they call a clear penchant for showmanship.</p>
        <p>"It's a lot of theatrics," said James R. "Skip" Markham, president of Petroleum Firefighters of Texascoei Inc., a new company in Irving, Tex. "You study the fire and study the fire. It pays to be slow, at least it has in the past."</p>
        <p>Dr. Kendall of M.I.T., who is chairman of the Union of Concerned Scientists, was more appreciative of orthodox ways. "It's clear the technologies of the Red Adairs are quite good," he said. "There's lots of very shrewd engineering. But it's a skilled art and practiced by a limited number of people. There have never been more than a few oil fires simultaneously. Now you've got 600. That group is swamped."</p>
        <p>At the scientific conference, Kuwaiti officials lauded a proposal to use a huge air cannon to clear away the mine fields that are hampering firefighting efforts. Its flexible arm, suspended on a boom, would blast a strip of desert 30 feet wide and one foot deep, detonating and flinging mines out of the way like a giant leaf blower.</p>
        <p>Dr. Stirling Colgate, a physicist from the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, suggested that the cannon might also act as an abrasive cutting tool simply by introducing sand into the flexible arm to mix with the air. The cannon could then be used to slice through concrete walls and extraneous pipes around a well's center.</p>
        <p>"Prototypes of these systems are expected to be ready for field-testing in Kuwait within a matter of days," according to a written summary of the meeting.</p>
        <p>Another idea that arose at the conference was to put explosive collars around exposed oil pipes to create precision blasts. Upon detonation, these would seal off a pipe by causing its implosion, simultaneously ending the fire and the flow of oil. Advanced methods of implosion have been used by the makers of atom bombs for decades.</p>
        <p>Ideas to aid the fight are emerging not only at scientific gatherings but across the country among experts of every stripe. Dr. Henry B. Crichlow, a consultant in Norman, Okla., who formerly headed the University of Oklahoma Petroleum and Geological Engineering School, has argued that problems with water supplies in the arid region could be solved much more readily than now planned. A long pipe is currently being built to bring water from the Persian Gulf.</p>
        <p>Far better, Dr. Crichlow said in an interview, would be to use nature's own water supplies beneath most Kuwaiti oil fields. By drilling 200 feet lower than the depth of oil producing wells, he said, the Kuwaitis could reach a huge aquifer that would provide endless amounts of water under high pressure. No pumping would be required.</p>
        <p>"New ideas and new technology have to play a role," he said.</p>
        <p>He noted that he and some associates were pioneering a new (and secret) firefighting process of their own. "We think the new technology is literally going to put these guys out of business," he said. "It's like precision-guided bombs as opposed to hand grenades."</p>
        <p>Mr. Markham of Petroleum Firefighters was slightly less secretive about the efforts of his group, saying it had developed a mix of dry chemicals, super-cold foams and wet chemicals to battle the oil fires, several of the methods having already been tested in the field. For some fires, he said, the company would deploy chemical-dispensing robots. He hinted that super-cold foams based on carbon dioxide would administer the coup de grace. Swamped by Suggestions</p>
        <p>"We expect to make quite a bit of money," he said, adding that he was flying to London this week to meet Kuwaiti officials.</p>
        <p>Some ideas are languishing for lack of adequate evaluation. Schools, businesses and Federal agencies with proven expertise in fighting oil fires say they have been swamped by so many suggestions that they find it difficult to evaluate them.</p>
        <p>Gene Pearcey, president of Earth Systems Inc., of Durango, Colo., which makes devices to form large concrete structures, said he had much trouble trying to get the established Texas firms to seriously assess his proposal, which he says has an elegant simplicity.</p>
        <p>First, his firm's construction methods would be used to create a concrete dome 40 feet across and weighing 100 tons. The dome would then be lifted by a crane over the blazing well, extinguishing the fire as the air supply was cut off.</p>
        <p>The dome could then be pulled off and re-used on nearby wells or could be left in place as a temporary cap. While not heavy enough to stop the oil flow, he said, the dome could be fitted with a pipe that could direct the rushing oil and gas into pipelines or tankers.</p>
        <p>"It's a simple principle, like snuffing out a candle," he said.</p>
        <p>Contradicting charges of close-mindedness, at least one of the traditional companies, Boots &amp; Coots, yesterday used an innovative technique in which a portable casing was fitted over a wellhead and filled with liquid nitrogen to extinguish a small fire.</p>
        <p>But an expert at Red Adair, the industry leader, expressed skepticism about new techniques, saying his firm had been inundated with thousands of bizarre tips.</p>
        <p>"It's insane," said Danny Clayton, a well-control specialist with Adair in Houston. "Ninety-nine point 999999 percent of the ideas are from people who have never seen an oil well. The ideas we've seen that are usable are the ones we've been using for years."</p>
        <p>Perhaps the traditionalists are right. After all, their methods are empirical and have clearly worked over the years while the new ideas are largely talk, with the exception of yesterday's capping. In the end, the roustabouts may have the last laugh.</p>
