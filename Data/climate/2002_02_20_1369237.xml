        <p>In one appearance after another during President Bush's 72-hour stay in Japan, his praise for Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi was so hearty that many Japanese were left with the impression of one long bearhug.</p>
        <p>During a joint news conference on Monday, Mr. Bush spoke over and over again of his confidence, faith and trust in Mr. Koizumi and his efforts at economic reform. Mr. Bush resumed that tone today before Parliament, comparing the prime minister to Ichiro Suzuki of the Seattle Mariners, the 2001 American League most valuable player.</p>
        <p>The president called Mr. Koizumi ''a close friend,'' who ''reminds me of a new American star, Ichiro -- the prime minister can hit anything you throw at him.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's unusually enthusiastic embrace comes, awkwardly, at a time when Japanese themselves have been fast losing confidence in a leader who had been extraordinarily popular. So from economic experts to stock traders to Japanese political analysts, the question many people were asking today was whether the American pep talk would do Mr. Koizumi any good.</p>
        <p>The initial response from the markets was not encouraging. The Nikkei 225 index of the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell back below the psychological 10,000 barrier, and the dollar enjoyed its biggest gain in a week, jumping about one yen to hover around 133 yen.</p>
        <p>While answering reporters' questions during the news conference, Mr. Koizumi spoke with remarkable candor at one point about Japan's string of economic reversals since the late 1980's. ''Ten years ago Japan was perhaps a little overconfident,'' he said. ''Today, Japan has lost confidence in itself.''</p>
        <p>Many Japanese political analysts say that lately it is Mr. Koizumi himself who has lost self-confidence as well as the confidence of the public. The prime minister has been battered in opinion polls recently over his firing of a popular foreign minister and is increasingly facing challenges from within his own Liberal Democratic Party.</p>
        <p>Indeed, before his vaunted economic reforms ever got off the ground, Mr. Koizumi has been under pressure to change direction and declare a new war against deflation.</p>
        <p>''The most important impact of the visit will be on Koizumi himself, because Koizumi lost his confidence,'' said Ikuo Kabashima, a political analyst at Tokyo University. ''The gesture of friendship from President Bush will give him more legitimacy within his own party. The impact on the people, though, is less certain, and in the end it may be pretty slim.''</p>
        <p>But because Mr. Bush did not offer advice to Mr. Koizumi publicly, nor did the prime minister make his persistent but vague pledges to carry out economic reforms any clearer, few analysts were willing to predict a new departure for the Japanese economy or for Mr. Koizumi's standing with the public.</p>
        <p>''Bush felt it was wise to show strong support for Koizumi rather than making critical, or even constructively critical comments,'' said Takashi Inoguchi, a specialist in international relations at Tokyo University. ''It was amazingly amicable, but without much substance. The result is that we were left with a lot of ambiguities on both sides.''</p>
        <p>On North Korea, for example, Mr. Koizumi expressed understanding for Mr. Bush's comments, including his inclusion of that country in an ''axis of evil,'' but said Japan wanted to normalize relations with North Korea. On global warming, the prime minister contradicted Mr. Bush ever so subtly, saying he saw no conflict between protecting the environment and fostering economic growth.</p>
        <p>American ambiguities were just as evident. Andrew Smithers, a British economist here, said after Mr. Bush's plane had taken off for Korea: ''I don't think there is likely to be an economic impact at all. The American attitude to Japan is caught in a bind -- they want the Japanese economy to recover, but it can only recover with a weaker yen, which they don't want.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Smithers contends that Japan can start reducing its public and private debt loads only through controlled inflation.</p>
        <p>Similarly, although Mr. Bush may have avoided criticism of Japan himself, in a recent drumbeat of statements, Bush administration officials have been more direct.</p>
        <p>Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, for example, recently spelled out this recovery recipe: ''Japan needs to counter deflation, it needs to rely on the market to revalue and revive unproductive assets, and it needs to foster more opportunity through deregulation.''</p>
        <p>Then Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said in an interview with Japanese reporters, ''There's no way Japan can export itself out of its problem without fixing the nonperforming assets and changing the monetary policy.''</p>
        <p>Japanese and American political analysts agree that beneath the smiles and complimentary talk, Washington is deeply worried about Japan, but also deeply conflicted about what it can do to help this country get its house in order.</p>
        <p>The Bush administration has seemed eager to highlight a different approach to Japan from that of the Clinton White House: more friendly support and less lecturing. But in light of this country's steadily worsening economic circumstances, many Japanese say they would welcome more American pressure.</p>
