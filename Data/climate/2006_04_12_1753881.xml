        <p>There is no reason to smirk just because Brad Pitt is the narrator of PBS's ''Rx for Survival -- The Heroes,'' a documentary about people fighting health calamities worldwide. His humanitarian streak may be a little overexposed these days, but that shouldn't matter.

        <p>There is no reason to smirk just because Brad Pitt is the narrator of PBS's ''Rx for Survival -- The Heroes,'' a documentary about people fighting health calamities worldwide. His humanitarian streak may be a little overexposed these days, but that shouldn't matter. It may not speak well of the American psyche, but celebrities do make a huge difference in causes as complicated as third world debt relief, global warming and stem cell research, and it would be foolish of PBS not to use movie stars to draw attention to a crisis.</p>
        <p>Showcasing the drug company Merck as a major sponsor of the two-hour film seems a bit much. However much the mandate of public television has changed with the times, most viewers still expect PBS to provide programs that commercial networks are reluctant to broadcast and that are free of corporate self-interest, bias or just bad taste. Merck's credit -- a gauzy opening advertisement that vaunts the company's selfless contributions to global health under the company slogan, ''Where Patients Come First'' -- suggests all three.</p>
        <p>The Merck Company Foundation inarguably does good, useful work in Africa and other stricken regions. But there is plenty of commercial time on network and cable television to make that case, and Merck has made ample use of it ever since the company got into trouble over its pain medication Vioxx. On PBS, the company's public relations agenda is all the more blatant in contrast to the more modest credit taken by the film's other main sponsor, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. That nonprofit organization merely flashed its name on the screen.</p>
        <p>PBS isn't breaking the rules; since 2004, it has allowed member stations to loosen guidelines on the content of sponsors' credits, and everything from Microsoft to Chuck E. Cheese has placed advertisements on PBS that look like the ones on commercial television. But however much the end may justify the means, the line between public service and corporate self-help on public television keeps getting blurrier.</p>
        <p>The documentary itself seems well intentioned and untainted: PBS paid for the re-editing of material taken from a six-episode special on the global health crisis that ran in November 2005 and was underwritten by the Gates Foundation and Merck. That epic was pared down to focus on eight ''heroes,'' and wisely so. The sheer enormity of the problems, from malaria and TB to SARS and avian flu, has a way of desensitizing viewers. By highlighting a few individual efforts, the film delivers signs of progress and hope within an otherwise unfathomable landscape of death and disease.</p>
        <p>The heroes include Ernest Darkoh, an African-born doctor trained in the United States, who spearheaded one of the first and most successful H.I.V. treatment programs in Botswana, an initiative partly supported by Merck. (''I think we'll lose, arguably, half the continent of Africa,'' he says, explaining his motivation.) The program also focuses on a doctor and an aid worker in Northern India who committed themselves to eradicating the last, stubborn remnants of polio through a huge vaccination program.</p>
        <p>All the projects seem realistic as well as idealistic, be it supplying motorcycles equipped with sidecar stretchers to remote African villages that have no other way of transporting sick people to clinics or distributing life-saving vitamin A drops to children in South Asia. ''Rx for Survival,'' is intended not to scare viewers straight, but to make them feel that something not only must be done but can be done.</p>
        <p>The special is inspiring, but it is mostly recycled material and could not have cost very much to produce, which makes the plug for Merck all the more unnecessary. It may seem harsh to hold PBS, politically besieged and perennially underfinanced, to such lofty standards, but those demarcation lines are among the main reasons public television still has a loyal audience. Public television obviously cannot rely solely on government funds and pledge drives that feature Yanni and the Celtic Tenors. But they should still be able to choose sponsors whose participation in a given project is entirely above second-guessing.</p>
        <p>When a drug company underwrites a documentary about health crises in which drugs, vitamins and vaccines are so obviously critical, there is a chance that viewers will wonder if there are any hidden quid pro quos. And the more those boundaries are crossed on commercial television, the more viewers crave black-and-white accountability from public stations.</p>
        <p>Pandering to celebrity worship is not the problem. Mr. Pitt's distractingly handsome face is not shown, and while his is not a particularly distinctive voice for a narrator, the images and interviews with patients, scientists and aid workers speak eloquently for themselves.</p>
        <p>It would have been even better if they could express themselves without a message from Merck.</p>
        <p>Rx for Survival  The Heroes</p>

Apsell, senior executive producer for NOVA and director of the WGBH Science Unit; for Vulcan Productions, Paul G. Allen, chairman and executive in charge; Jody Patton, president and executive in charge.</p>
