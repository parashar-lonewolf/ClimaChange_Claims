        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki said yesterday that he was likely to support a move to reduce the state tax on gasoline, but added that he planned to pressure the Legislature to adopt other measures to reduce the state's dependence on Middle Eastern oil.</p>
        <p>''I've never met a tax cut I don't like and I expect that I will be supporting this tax cut,'' Mr. Pataki said at a news conference in SoHo. ''I have to look at the actual details of the bill,'' he said, calling it a step in the right direction but adding that it was more important for the state ''to look at the broader picture and make New York the renewable energy capital of our country.''</p>

        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki said yesterday that he was likely to support a move to reduce the state tax on gasoline, but added that he planned to pressure the Legislature to adopt other measures to reduce the state's dependence on Middle Eastern oil.</p>
        <p>''I've never met a tax cut I don't like and I expect that I will be supporting this tax cut,'' Mr. Pataki said at a news conference in SoHo. ''I have to look at the actual details of the bill,'' he said, calling it a step in the right direction but adding that it was more important for the state ''to look at the broader picture and make New York the renewable energy capital of our country.''</p>
        <p>Federal, state and local taxes add an average of 67.9 cents to the price of a gallon of gas in New York State, where gasoline taxes are the highest in the nation. Legislative leaders in Albany agreed last week to cut 4 to 9 cents a gallon from the tax, even though it was unclear that it would actually lower prices.</p>
        <p>Until yesterday, Mr. Pataki had not taken a position on the measure. He said he would still urge the Legislature to do more to reduce dependence on foreign oil, like creating incentives to encourage the purchase of hybrid vehicles and increasing the availability of alternative fuels.</p>
        <p>Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has said he is against lowering the gas tax, but on another issue, he cast himself last night as a champion of the environment. In a speech he gave to the League of Conservation Voters, Mr. Bloomberg announced the creation of a task force and a new Division of Sustainability within the Mayor's Office of Operations to ensure that future developments meet certain environmental standards.</p>
