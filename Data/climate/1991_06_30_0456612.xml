        <p>THE SKY WAS BLUE, THE sand was white, and Tom Carroll, one of the best surfers in the world, was "getting tubed."

        <p>Beer and surfing have always had one thing in common: foam. More recently they joined hands for the 1990 Pipeline Masters surfing contest, known informally as Pipemasters and sponsored by Marui, a Japanese department store. But Marui and Coors were hardly the only companies buying advertising at Pipeline.

At times, it seemed as if the waves themselves were telling you in one way or another that Kilroy Was Here.</p>
        <p>As older surf devotees remember, surfing -- tied with baseball for first place in the mystical-subtext department -- was not always a commercial proposition. Whether you called it art, religion or dropping out, there was a time when people surfed strictly for love. For those who believe in origin theories, it all started in Hawaii, where, according to one ancient legend, there lived a shark woman named Mamala who surfed "where the winds blew strong and whitecaps were on waves." This may well be an early reference to the North Shore of Oahu, sacred waters for the serious surfer -- site of Sunset, hailed by Surfer Magazine as "the embodiment of Hawaiian power and challenge," and of Waimea Bay, where, as Hemingway might have put it, men ride mountains and ride them truly. And then there is . . . Pipeline.</p>
        <p>Pipeline, also known as the Banzai Pipeline, crashes in massive, perfect curls over deadly coral reef.  Even professional surfers have been carried away on stretchers after reading the wave incorrectly. It is a killer. What goes on in this consecrated curl? "It's the drop," says Phil Edwards, the first non-Hawaiian ever to surf Pipeline, referring to the near-vertical wave face and its time-bending speed. "Once you drop in," Edwards explains, "it's almost too late."</p>
        <p>Gerry Lopez, considered by many of his peers to be the King of the Pipeline, sees it differently. As he tells it, there's a very complicated tune being played inside the tube. "You're as close to a state of pure mind as you can get, short of meditation," he says. "You've done all your thinking before you get there. You just experience it. There is no thought involved. It's such a brief moment, but time seems to stretch, as it does in all situations of extreme intensity."</p>
        <p>When pressed further on the mysteries of Pipeline, Lopez dashes from the patio into his three-decker Pipeline house (it rumbles when the waves really crank) and emerges with one of those blown-up "you are there" tube photos. It shows him blissed out inside the barrel, as usual. "Stand back and look," he says, bracing the photo against a sliding door.</p>
        <p>He outlines the curl of the wave with a finger. "See this old Hawaiian?" he says, tracing the face of a Polynesian Neptune. Not really. "Come back later and take another look," he says, then slips back into the house with the photo of Pipeline the way it used to be -- big, hollow, and no product labels inside.</p>
        <p>FOR MOST AMERICANS, surfing crested in the mid-60's with the beach-blanket movies, Gidget, Jan and Dean, the Beach Boys and the documentary "The Endless Summer." Then the ancient sport seemed to float back out to sea for a few years. It checked back in for a meeting with Tom Wolfe (who predicted in "The Pump House Gang" that its hard-core practitioners would soon beach themselves), decided to drop out again, resurfaced after Vietnam and channeled a message through Robert Duvall in "Apocalypse Now" ("Charlie don't surf"), took another hike and returned a few years later in the form of Sean Penn for some fast times at Ridgemont High ("There's only two things I want out of life: some tasty waves and a righteous buzz"), then paddled back out to sea, took a nap for a decade, got another wake-up call from Hollywood, came back as "Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles" and shouted "Cowabunga!"</p>
        <p>Here's what really happened. The Beach Boys are now beach men and everybody's still surfing. In fact, so many people are ripping it up that anyone who remembers the surf of yore complains that the waves are too crowded. "I haven't surfed weekends at Malibu in years," says the legendary Lance Carson, the basis for one of the lost souls in "Big Wednesday," the 1978 John Milius film about surfing as Greek tragedy. "It's like the freeway out there." And it's not just Malibu that's crowded; it's every decent surf spot in the world, especially the North Shore of Oahu during winter, which is when the surf is supposed to be at its prime.</p>
        <p>Every winter since 1971, contestants have surfed for prize money in the Pipemasters, organized by Fred Hemmings, veteran Hawaiian big-wave man. "At that time," he says, "there were only a few Pipeline virtuosos, so it was my idea to start a masters contest with the very best invited. Then, rather than having their surfing reputations made by the editors of surfing magazines, their reputations could actually be earned by performance in the water."</p>
        <p>The longest-running professional surf contest in the country, the Pipemasters forms part of surfing's Triple Crown. Along with the Hard Rock Cafe World Cup and the Billabong Pro, also held on the North Shore, it gives a final flourish to the world tour of the Association of Surfing Professionals, a marathon (18 events this year) with prize money totaling $2 million.</p>
        <p>The scale and prosperity of the pro tour is quite a vindication for a sport that Christian missionaries tried to squelch, alarmed that the Polynesians were having too much fun in too few clothes. Today those who would spread the word now ride the board for the Lord. There are at least 10 Christian surfing associations in the United States, and an active contingent of born-again surfers, some of whom carry boards emblazoned with the slogan "Jesus Is My Sponsor."</p>
        <p>Today, top male pros can earn $100,000 a year in prize money; the top women, $30,000, on a tour with a total purse of $155,000. That doesn't include endorsement deals. For top stars, multiyear deals can run into seven figures. And there's always the "photo incentive" money -- up to about $1,000 -- that the relevant sponsor pays to surfers who make the cover or an inside spread of Surfer or Surfing Magazine. "When I think about everything I have, just because I can stand on a surfboard," one Australian pro says, "I just laugh."</p>
        <p>ACCORDING TO LOCALS, last December on the North Shore was the worst for surf in 20 years. Some blamed global warming, which reduces the intensity of the Arctic-driven storms that churn the water. Others said it might simply have been a recurring weather pattern, although not enough is known about weather of the past to say for certain. But there was widespread agreement on one issue: the 1990 Pipemasters Tournament was held in conditions that had nothing to do with Pipeline and everything to do with money.</p>
        <p>When Pipeline cranks, the waves generally run 8 to 10 feet. This year, the surf during much of the contest was in the three-to-five-foot range and sloppy -- what surfers call "garbage." The mighty Pipeline, which has been known to break boards like matchsticks, resembled a wave pool powered by a Yugo. But the show went on, resulting in poor performances by surfers who normally dominate at Pipeline and good performances by those who specialize in small surf.</p>
        <p>Gerry Lopez, for example, did not fare well. Because he was not on the circuit, he was unseeded, and had to surf through the trials. "I don't really have the contest mind-set," he says. "Surfing in a contest is more than just ability, it's attitude. Contest surfing is a lot like method acting. You have to put yourself in a serious state of mind about surf that isn't serious."</p>
        <p>Another surfer who did not do well was 20-year-old Christian Fletcher, a Southern Californian who surfs only contests that he likes, proclaiming that "all pros are yuppies." Fletcher's family could be described as a gang of well-to-do pirate surfers. Christian, his brother, Nathan, and his father, Herbie, overflow with surf sound bites, all of them provocative, some of them even half-true. Christian's blackguard style, a family tradition, impresses a lot of fans, but some surfers regard him with the contempt normally reserved for the Australians and their "make my day" demeanor. "You can't come from San Clemente," says Aaron Chang, a top surf photographer, "and be Johnny Rotten."</p>
        <p>In the past few years, Christian has brought a series of outlandish moves from the turf, where he attempts to fly on a skateboard, to the surf, where he attempts to fly on a surfboard. Few surfers are as adept as Christian at the aerial, a maneuver in which the surfer actually becomes airborne for a moment and comes back down the face of the wave. He also specializes in such other skateboarding moves as "the frontside ollie, backside ollie, stalefish and backside stalefish, which is a stalefish McTwist, which I'm hoping to rename the McFletch as soon as I do it right." As Fletcher tells it, these moves are not understood by judges and therefore are not awarded points, the reason why he does not generally score well at contests.</p>
        <p>Surfing is judged on the Olympic 10-point system. During each 20-minute heat, surfers catch up to 10 waves; their scores are a total of their best four. Five judges award points based on the number of maneuvers (tube rides, floaters, top turns, bottom turns), length of ride and execution (performing as close as possible to the breaking portion of the wave). As Bernie Baker, a Triple Crown official, points out: "Aerials fit in only when connected with a prior or subsequent maneuver. They seem to help the surfer who uses it as a final maneuver, not just as a move in and of itself. But it's all very subjective."</p>
        <p>Gerry Lopez agrees: "No two people ever see the same thing in the same way. Although the judging system that they have now is probably the most effective, it leaves unanswered questions, like why certain people lost. Judges are like everyone else. They can't always recognize new things." Of course, points out Pam Burridge, this year's female world champion, "When you win, they're all good judges."</p>
        <p>SURFING IS HARD TO judge because it's really more a dance than a sport. And as with dance, esthetics count as much as quantifiable technical moves. To add a further complication, style tends to be rooted in a philosophy of surf, which tends to reflect an approach to life. You may be able to execute a floater on a tri-finned thruster at Narrabeen, Australia, but can you noseride a longboard at San Onofre, Calif.? Translation: just because you can "shred" a wave doesn't mean you can really surf. Further explanation: there are many kinds of surfboards, but basically they are variations on two themes -- shortboards and longboards, with a board length of nine feet defining the boundary between the two, as well as certain design features. Shortboards are thinner, with pointed noses; longboards have rounded noses.</p>
        <p>Board choice reflects one's world view. In the beginning was the word and the word was longboard, according to old-school surfers, who often have long hair, and believe in going with the flow. They surf for love, an approach known as "soul surfing." Atop their "sticks," longboard demigods like Phil Edwards and Lance Carson, now middle-aged, show a grace and spiritual centeredness that make surfing not so much a balancing act as a ballet.</p>
        <p>The new breed, many of them under 30, surf for money. They tend not to pursue the soul-surf ideal of letting the wave ride you. They believe a wave is there not only to be ridden, but to be ripped, carved, shredded and "Mansoned." The best board for this type of surfing is a three-finned thruster, a shortboard that first appeared in 1981, just in time for the Reagan decade.</p>
        <p>The introduction of the three-finned thruster helped consolidate Australian domination of the pro tour during the early 80's. The board itself has come to symbolize a cocky, "aggro" attitude. Just as folkies blamed the electric guitar for corrupting their cherished music, so surfing purists blame the shortboard for the decadence of surfing. The shortboard, the argument goes, made it possible to perform flashy maneuvers on waves that in the old days were too small to rip, which is why it's so crowded out there. The shortboard is light, so anyone -- even a girl -- can carry it to the beach without too much trouble, which is why it's so crowded out there. The shortboard is the McDonald's way to surf, which is why it's so crowded out there. . . . The shortboard also insured that even garbage waves could not ruin a contest; on the contrary, small-surf specialists could clean up when the waves were trashed-out. As a result, the pro tour became a more dependable financial proposition.</p>
        <p>The division between the two surfing camps is so profound that for years Lance Carson endured the derision of shortboard wave jockeys because he decided to fight rather than switch. "I just don't like the shortboard mentality," he says. "It's generally about money and about making it look like you're doing more than what needs to be done. I was the only guy for miles with a noserider. Everybody was always yelling, 'Hey, Carson, you dinosaur!' "</p>
        <p>This is more than some curmudgeon complaining about progress. In surfing, style is everything, which is why judging it is so subjective. "Style used to be a clan thing," says Bolton Colburn, former pro and currently curator of collections at the Laguna Art Museum in Southern California. "You were given access to the secrets of the tribe by local elders." In Colburn's view, certain moves became "emblems of power and group identity." Today, he says, "indigenous flair is being toned down by a global standard" -- a Paula Abdul style of surfing that is long on technique and short on soul. "In my opinion," Colburn says, "the high point of modern surfing style coincides with the high point of American culture -- the late 50's. Cadillacs were modeled after spaceships and surfboards were made of industrial wonder materials such as foam and fiberglass."</p>
        <p>The rift between these two antagonistic camps -- longboard and shortboard, art and commerce -- has been bridged in quite dazzling fashion by the 1990 world champion, Tom Curren, the American who wrested the title from the Australians after dropping out of the circuit for a year.</p>
        <p>Curren surfs for money; he has endorsement deals with Ocean Pacific and Rip Curl. But his style is so patently born of a spiritual urge to surf that it has withstood the pressure to conform. No matter that he didn't surf well at Pipeline. The instant he paddled out, a hush fell over the beach as the crowd focused on his almost palpable energy vortex. While the rest of the pack paddled one way, Curren slipped out in the opposite direction. Then he stopped and waited as the other contestants, succumbing to the pressure of the clock, surfed in on inferior waves. Finally, he got one.</p>
        <p>Displaying none of the emptiness of corporate surfing, but still executing all the moves that judges like, he advanced up and down his board like a cat, like Nureyev on a stage. The heat was a bust, but the ride was not; Curren had caught the best wave of the day. As Derek Hynd, a surf journalist and coach, observes: "Tom Curren is the ocean. He has the power to draw waves to him. I've seen it happen. It's quite incredible, really."</p>
        <p>THE DISAPPOINTING waves at Pipemasters seemed to reflect a momentary becalming of the surfing industry. Many of the clothing companies that dropped in on the wave of surf culture in the 80's have gone broke. The companies that survive are the ones with actual ties to the surfing community. This has resulted in fewer ad pages in Surfer and Surfing, fewer sponsors for touring pros and less prize money on the '91 tour.</p>
        <p>Lest this be interpreted as a triumphant tube ride for art, consider that 19-year-old Kelly Slater signed what is rumored to be the largest endorsement deal in surfing history -- somewhere in the vicinity of $1.5 million -- with Quiksilver, the company that made Tom Carroll the first "million-dollar surfer" five years ago.</p>
        <p>Slater is regarded by many in the community as the successor to Curren, an American surfer who can continue to keep the Aussies in their place for a while, down under in the No. 2 position. He is also regarded -- at least by his manager -- as the straw that will stir the drink of commercial surfing in years to come. The recent high-school grad has movie-star looks, earned straight A's, and just says no to bad things. He's the90's answer to Corky Carroll, one of the first surfers to land an endorsement deal when Jantzen swimsuits signed him up in 1966. Carroll was everybody's favorite beach animal, an icon at a time when heroes said yes to the things you were supposed to say no to. Recently he recorded his beaches-bucks-and-babes existence in a book, "Surf-Dog Days and Bitchin' Nights."</p>
        <p>While Carroll now runs motivational seminars and hopes for a TV series, other surf pioneers can chalk one up for longboard consciousness. The venerated style is now enjoying a comeback in certain enclaves on the West Coast. Both Phil Edwards in San Juan Capistrano and Lance Carson in Malibu have returned to the business of shaping longboards, due to a recent upsurge in demand for their custom-made cruisers. And Herbie Fletcher is sponsoring a surf competition in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, next month that will include longboards.</p>
        <p>Does this mean that the surf industry has exchanged its Coors cap for one that reads "Have a Nice Day"? Or is it merely a new chapter in surf marketing? Some of the major companies sponsor "soul surfing" junkets, flying famous surfers to Fiji, Bali and other island paradises to surf for photo incentives on uncrowded waves. Seizing the opportunity, Carson is introducing a "back to basics" clothing line called Lance Carson Malibu, an antidote to the neon sunglasses, neoprene beachwear, and velcro a go-go that typified the 80's.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the ancient Hawaiian will have some answers. But a trip back to look at the cryptic Pipeline photo turns up a young Hawaiian, Johnny Boy Gomes, a local power surfer who explodes through the North Shore waves like a freight train. He may not be the ideal advertisement for beach culture, but he knows how to wait for a wave and what to do when he's inside one. What has he learned from his journeys to the center of the tube? What does he like about the trips? Basically, he's in it for the photo incentives. Photo incentives? Is that the message inside the conch shell? Gomes is a street kid from Makaha, on the west side of Oahu. Unlike other West Sides, like New York's and L.A.'s, Oahu's doesn't sell style; it</p>
        <p>is</p>
        <p>style -- pure, simple and Hawaiian. For Gomes, surfing is a way out, a route to a life that pays the rent and provides free boards and wetsuits.</p>
        <p>There are those who believe that money makes the escape act less artistic, that surfing fell from grace the day some guy with a checkbook decided to subsidize hanging ten. But according to Sam George, a columnist for Surfing Magazine, it doesn't matter: "People have tried to sterilize surfing and sell it to the masses. It won't happen. There's a defense mechanism. Surfing protects itself." SURFSPEAK: A GUIDE FOR THE CLUELESS</p>
        <p>Aggro (adj.): Aggressive. Used to describe the in-your-face, barbarians-at-the-wave surfing style of the 80's. Aloha (n): A warm, welcoming, clued-in spirit; frequently used by devotees of the Hawaiian surfer Gerry Lopez, as in, "That guy has more aloha than anyone you'll ever meet." Barney (n.): A thoughtless, clueless oaf. Someone who "drops in on" (see below) other surfers' waves, cutting them off. Big-wave men (n.): Surfers who head for locations like Waimea Bay, on Oahu's North Shore, where the waves can top 20 feet. Crank (v.): To have good surf, as in "The point is cranking." Drop in on (v.): To steal a wave after someone else is on it. Ex.: "There are three things I never do in life. I never hang out with a guy whose board says, 'Wash Me.' I never eat pork jerky before a date. And I never drop in on another guy's wave." Duke (proper n.): Duke Kahanamoku (1890-1968), the first great surfer of the modern era. Epic (adj.): Awesome. Filthy (adj.): Awesome, epic. Gel out (v.): Relax; take a chill pill. Getting tubed (v.): Surfing inside the tube, or curl, of a wave. Gnarly (adj.): Messy, sloppy. Used to describe surf that is difficult to navigate. Goofy-footer (n.): A surfer who puts his or her right foot forward on the board.  (Opposite of regular-footer.) Gun (n.): A surfboard designed for the higher speeds, bump, chop and currents common to big waves. Its longer rail line, or edge, puts more of the board in contact with the wave face. All surfers on the pro tour have one in their "quiver" (see below). Impact zone (n.): The shallow area where a wave breaks; not a good place to be. Kook (n.): An outsider who shows up on the local beach. Lineup (n.): Where you go to wait for waves. Longboard (n.): Generally speaking, any board nine feet or over. In the old days, longboards were made out of redwood and weighed a ton. As surfing evolved, "shapers" (see below) began to make them out of polyurethane foam, a development heralded in the 60's film "Cat on a Hot Foam Board," which features Phil Edwards, first surfer to make the cover of Sports Illustrated. Manson (v.): To tear apart a wave with sharp moves known as cutbacks. (n.) A surfer with a psychotically aggressive surfing style. Noserider (n.): A longboard that allows you to hang five or hang ten. Oval Office (n., archaic): The area inside a wave; the tube. (syn.: green room, crystal cathedral) Quiver (n.): A surfer's assortment of boards. Regular-footer (n.): Surfer who follows the classical style of left foot forward on the board. Rip (v.): To shred, carve or Manson a wave. Set (n.): A group of waves. Shaper (n.): One who designs and carves surfboards from foam. Critical to professional surfers, who sometimes take shapers along on the pro tour.</p>
        <p>Stoked (adj.): Excited, pumped-up. Yes, they still say it. Surfrider Foundation (prop. n.): A research and consciousness-raising organization of environmentally active surfers, including Tom Curren and fellow pro Gary Elkerton, as well as various surf companies. Surfers are often the first to see pollution in the ocean, and the first to experience the effects. Thruster (n.): A three-finned surfboard that normally ranges in length from 5 feet, 5 inches to 9 feet, 6 inches. It is now the standard board. Wave-Trak (prop. n.): Telephone number (900- 2GO-SURF) you can call to find out where the waves are around the world.
