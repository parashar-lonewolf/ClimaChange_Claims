        <p>AN earnest-looking farmer leans on his pickup in a recent print advertisement sponsored by the auto industry. ''Farming's tough enough with healthy-size pickups,'' the ad says. ''Imagine hauling feed barrels around in a subcompact.''</p>
        <p>Are pickups headed for extinction?</p>
        <p>The ad, which has appeared in several Congressional publications, is part of the auto industry's nationwide advertising and lobbying blitz against proposed increases in fuel economy standards. Environmental groups are countering with ads of their own, including one that points out that the Model T got better gas mileage than most sport utility vehicles.</p>
        <p>The Senate is scheduled to debate today whether to raise federal fuel economy standards for the first time since the 1980's or turn the matter over to the Bush administration. The recent rush of advertising has concentrated on at least a dozen states with senators that both groups perceive as on the fence, including Delaware, Georgia, Iowa, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Dakota and South Dakota.</p>
        <p>Detroit's argument is as blunt as the ''Senators, Save Our Trucks!'' plea that appeared in one industry ad in The North Dakota Bismarck Tribune. Increased standards will legislate S.U.V.'s, pickups and minivans out of existence, the lobbyists say. They will bring a financial apocalypse, including more than 100,000 job losses. And they will lead to a blood bath on the highways by increasing fatalities by the thousands, they say.</p>
        <p>''If these proposals pass, the only place you'll see a light truck is in a museum,'' said Gloria Bergquist, spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which sponsored the Congressional ads.</p>
        <p>Farmers would have to do chores with Volkswagen Beetles, according to the alliance ad. One small-business owner worried in another ad that the proposed standards would drive him out of business, though he and the farmer were actually chosen from stock photographs with testimonials provided by the auto industry.</p>
        <p>But environmental groups, some senators on both sides of the aisle and even a few officials in the auto industry say that the assertion that trucks would disappear is far-fetched. A television commercial by Franzén &amp; Company of Washington, sponsored by the National Environmental Trust, argues that automakers made many of the same assertions when fuel economy standards were first imposed in the 1970's. The ad cites a quotation from Chrysler in the 1970's that said the first wave of fuel economy regulations would bring about a world of subcompacts. That has not come to pass.</p>
        <p>''The auto industry is out there trying to shift the attention away from oil dependence, which they are primarily responsible for, and shift it onto extraneous issues which are not true,'' said Daniel F. Becker, the director of global warming at the Sierra Club.</p>
        <p>Automakers say that they would prefer that the fuel economy issue be handled by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a branch of the Transportation Department. Two of their allies, Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, and Senator Christopher S. Bond, Republican of Missouri, have jointly sponsored a bill that would turn the matter over to the traffic safety agency. Mr. Levin and auto executives have argued that the regulatory agency is better equipped to research fuel economy than Congress.</p>
        <p>A proposal jointly sponsored by Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, would increase the fuel economy of the average new automobile sold in the United States by about 50 percent by model year 2015. The Kerry-McCain measure would also require new safety standards to make trucks less dangerous to cars.</p>
        <p>Senator Kerry has pointed out that since General Motor's former top lobbyist, Andrew Card, is now President Bush's chief of staff, it would be unlikely for the administration to raise fuel standards significantly.  The industry's ads are primarily being run by two groups, the automobile alliance and the Coalition for Vehicle Choice, both financed by Detroit. ''Save the endangered S.U.V. and pickup,'' said one ad that appeared in The Manchester Union Leader in New Hampshire. The coalition, which backed the ad, did not return telephone calls to its headquarters. Another ad, which ran in Roll Call, a Congressional publication, said: ''Fuel economy is important. But safety is vital.''</p>
        <p>In a recent automobile alliance radio spot, by the Dan Rosenthal Company, an ad agency in Bethesda, Md., ''Sally'' complains to her doubting husband, ''Joe,'' that ''the government wants to take away my S.U.V.''</p>
        <p>Joe stammers, ''Well, but they say, y'know, who needs bigger vehicles?''</p>
        <p>An exasperated Sally responds that ''only builders, mechanics, families, farmers, small business, the entire tourism and travel industry, the military, park services, me, your dad. . .''</p>
        <p>Joe, defeated, concedes, ''O.K., Sally. O.K.''</p>
        <p>Environmental groups have fought back. The Model T versus S.U.V. ad, by MacWilliams, Robinson &amp; Partners of Washington, was sponsored by the Union of Concerned Scientists. It ran in Roll Call with the headline ''Darwin Would Not Be Impressed.'' A new bipartisan group, Americans for Energy Security, had a letter in Roll Call signed by politicos like Robert McFarlane, the national security adviser for President Ronald Reagan, and Harrison Ford, who played a president once in the movies.</p>
        <p>''Making vehicles more fuel efficient is the single most important step we can take to reduce our dependence on oil,'' the ad said.</p>
        <p>Most political analysts say this latest push to raise fuel standards will be as fruitless as previous ones. Not only would it face a Republican House and White House but getting it out of the Senate is expected to be difficult, despite concerns about dependence on foreign oil.</p>
        <p>But if the Kerry-McCain measure became law, would the S.U.V., the pickup and the minivan really vanish?</p>
        <p>Michael Morrissey, a G.M. spokesman, said: ''It'll be virtually impossible to meet the standards with vehicles that resemble the current offerings. We'll have to tear up our product lineup.''</p>
        <p>James Olson, chief lobbyist for Toyota, a member of the alliance who also says the Senate proposals are unrealistic, said, ''Anytime an industry engages Congress, it's always a game of poker.''</p>
        <p>''The industry tends to overstate and Congress tends to overact,'' he said. ''Hopefully, you find a middle ground somewhere down the road.''</p>
