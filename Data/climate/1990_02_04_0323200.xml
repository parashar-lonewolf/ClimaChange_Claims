        <p>LEAD: YOUNG MAN started his career as a makeup artist at a cosmetics company. He worked his way up and, with $80,000 from the sale of his house, moved to California to invent his own line. He ordered $500,000 worth of makeup and other products from an Italian concern that supplies the leading cosmetics companies, but when they arrived, the lipstick cases were smashed and the foundation bottles were shattered.</p>
        <p>YOUNG MAN started his career as a makeup artist at a cosmetics company. He worked his way up and, with $80,000 from the sale of his house, moved to California to invent his own line. He ordered $500,000 worth of makeup and other products from an Italian concern that supplies the leading cosmetics companies, but when they arrived, the lipstick cases were smashed and the foundation bottles were shattered. The young man melted and reshaped the lipsticks by holding a hair dryer to them; then, one by one, he placed them in new cases. He heated lip gloss on the kitchen stove and piped it through a pastry bag into containers. He carted his products to beauty salons to sell them. At night, he'd return to the stove, churning out a new supply for the next round of sales.</p>
        <p>He whipped up the specific colors that women asked for, starting a business in custom-made cosmetics. Nordstrom, the Seattle-based department store, learned about his makeup line and agreed to carry it in its stores. Women crowded around the counter requesting specially designed eye shadows, hand-mixed foundations and personalized lipsticks. It didn't take long before other companies noticed the activity. In August 1988, for an undisclosed fee, the young man sold his business to Revlon. He now drives a Rolls-Royce Corniche convertible to the company's offices in Beverly Hills, Calif.</p>
        <p>Roy Karrell, the founder of Visage Beaute, maker of custom-blended cosmetics, is a dreamer. The cosmetics business was built by those who dreamed - Estee Lauder, Elizabeth Arden, Helena Rubinstein - people who stirred face cream in their bathtubs, translating their grandmothers' recipes into big business. But, today, small companies can't afford to compete with the muscular few who dominate the industry. The creativity that built the business has been replaced with caution, and knockoffs outnumber fresh thinking.</p>
        <p>Mr. Karrell triumphed with a good idea: the marrying of his experience as a makeup artist with his career in the business. ''I took the service element of a beauty salon and combined it with the retail environment of the cosmetics business,'' he says. ''I see it as a service company, not a cosmetics company.'' To really succeed, though, he had to sell his company. ''There are just a few large corporations in the business now,'' he says. ''I would have been killed.''</p>
        <p>With working capital, Revlon gave Visage Beaute the opportunity to expand and run more efficiently, but still retain much of the origionality from its scrappy beginnings. The advertising and packaging are homely and amateurish, but Revlon seems to have no plans to change that. ''Down home and ugly are not necessarily out,'' says Allan G. Mottus, an industry consultant. ''It's real looking, and people believe it.'' Visage's approach to custom-blended makeup has been copied by other companies, and it is a solid, if relatively small, force in the business.</p>
        <p>Another dreamer, an Englishwoman named Anita Roddick, is shaking up the cosmetics business in profound ways. Ms. Roddick started the Body Shop in England in 1976 as a way to support her family. In her small shop in Brighton, she sold soaps, lotions, shampoos and creams based on ancient formulas - pineapple as a skin cleanser, cocoa butter as a moisturizer, Japanese azuki beans ground into washing grains. She discovered many of these elixirs on her travels as a teacher for the United Nations. These products were packaged in simple, refillable plastic bottles with hand-written labels on them. Along with honest, basic treatments, Ms. Roddick sold her messages for social change. She allowed no animal testing, and created nothing ''that made your breasts larger, your thighs thinner or took the wrinkles off your face,'' she says. ''I'm not part of that cosmetic pursuit for the Nobel prize for promise.'' Her window displays alerted people to the destruction of the rain forests and the ozone layer, her catalogue told customers about saving the whales.</p>
        <p>Her company grew, with 450 shops throughout the world. But her approach never changed. ''The cheap containers, the refill system,'' she says, ''When we became successful, we didn't change anything. That's the smartest thing we ever did.'' The company still doesn't advertise, but it places all of its stores in high-traffic areas. The shops themselves are tempting, sparkling places, with no counters separating consumers from the products; you can pull things off shelves, open bottles and sample the goods.</p>
        <p>''The Body Shop has become like the soda shop or the bookstore where people just get together,'' says Mr. Mottus. ''Department stores are like mausoleums, they're so serious. She's created a festive place.'' Ms. Roddick has also managed to produce high-quality products at relatively low prices, drawing young consumers to her store. Combining a business that's based on vanity and fluff with social responsibility may seem far-fetched, but the message is delivered with such conviction and clarity that it works. ''This woman is really going to leave a mark,'' says Mr. Mottus. ''She's revolutionizing the business with the products themselves, and the way she sells them.'' Fred Hayman is not an unknown commodity in the fragrance business.</p>
