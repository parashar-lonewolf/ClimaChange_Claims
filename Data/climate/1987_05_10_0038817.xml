        <p>LEAD: AFTER the gray skies of winter break and patches of blue burst out more frequently from whitening clouds then, in the first glorious sun-filled days of spring, the human spirit rises to greet the coming season of rebirth. The warmth and promise, so different from the chill before and the dulling heat to come, provide the most delicious time of the year.</p>
        <p>AFTER the gray skies of winter break and patches of blue burst out more frequently from whitening clouds then, in the first glorious sun-filled days of spring, the human spirit rises to greet the coming season of rebirth. The warmth and promise, so different from the chill before and the dulling heat to come, provide the most delicious time of the year.</p>
        <p>We anticipate and savor these glorious days and recognize anew how climate shapes our lives. The thought that our climate could drastically change is insupportable. We accept that weather, the day-to-day interactions of our atmosphere, continuously changes. But climate, the general feel of life's living space. the averaged shift of the seasons, this is, we expect, a sacred constant. Ask a longtime resident what August is like in New York and receive a grimace-like smile that says. ''August is what I endure to live the rich, bright days of autumn.''</p>
        <p>When science speaks out and breaks our confidence that the pattern of our climate will continue for all our days, it shocks the mind like the sound of a door slammed when dozing. That New York should bear the temperatures of Florida destroys the essence of New York. Yet that is the message the climatologists are sending. Worse yet, we are told that we are in the process of doing it to ourselves. We are the climate changers.</p>
        <p>Our use of energy, our demand for the goods of the world, is being met at a cost. Our fossil-fuel-based industrial world has reached the level of air pollution that threatens to change, not only the climate of our region, but the climate of the planet. We have taken pride in how, in some places, we have changed the landscape. We have built towers and bridges that rise defiantly from the earth. Concrete ribbons overlay the wilderness and give us access to nature's remote corners. But we know enough to treasure the natural world and leave portions of it untouched. To change the whole earth, to alter the global climate, when did we gain this power? Did we want it? Yet the facts are there. Excess carbon dioxide, the product of our energy use, is building in that blue sky we cherish. Other gases released in huge quantities by our automobiles, by our broken refrigerators and air conditioners, and by some of our manufacturing processes are, day by day, adding their invisible presence to the thermal blanket that will cause global warming. One of the agents that absorbs carbon dioxide is the forests of the world. But we are cutting these with prodigious efficiency as we also limit their ability to photosynthesize by dumping acid rain on their leaves and roots.</p>
        <p>Through all this I knew that the ''we'' was an equivocation. I was writing about myself. I have contributed my share and more to the harming of the earth I love, and every day I wake to do it again. But on the other hand, I have worked hard and saved. Have I not earned the right to my life style? If the production of my necessities and comforts sends carbon dioxide, nitrous oxides and other strange gases into the atmosphere is that my fault? If the weather becomes uncomfortably hot I will just have to turn my air-conditioner up a notch.</p>
        <p>I could, I guess, learn to cope with global warming and suffer the loss of what I had, like the time-dimmed loss of a loved one. But small friends that share this world with me could not cope. Death would come to vast numbers of animals and plants because their habitats would change too quickly for them to adapt. I cannot live with that. As a patient ill with a fatal disease would study the illness, I read and studied about the greenhouse effect.</p>
        <p>It might take 20 or 30 years but the path I - we - are traveling will lead to starvation and death for millions. Just a small deviation from our global mean temperature will cause changes in rainfall patterns that will make our best food-growing areas arid plains. Long before the increase in temperature melts the ice caps and raises the sea level to flood our coastal regions and fertile wetlands, storms and shifting ocean currents would drastically change the lives of the millions who live near or depend on the oceans.</p>
        <p>What right did I have to so alter nature's patterns that future generations will be unable to enjoy what I have had? Yet if I abstained, as best I could, from contributing to the gaseous wastes what effect would it have? What could a single person do? I had to do something. I searched and found a few others who also felt the way I do. Last January six of us decided on a simple plan. We knew that people acting together could make a difference but most were unaware of the danger ahead and the need and possibilities for action.</p>
        <p>Five of us were educators and it was natural for us to be ready to offer information. We would provide an advisory service to those interested in understanding the greenhouse effect. We would contact experts in the field, make digests of the latest scientific information and send it, without charge, to anyone who asked for it. As new information became available we would send that along, too. We found that policy advisers and some legislators were wrestling with the problem. Our network could let more people know what they were proposing. It was a good plan. It was important work. We shook hands on it.</p>
        <p>We obtained some private financing so that people who wanted information did not have the fear of being dunned for contributions. The quintessential pieces of equipment for an information network, a computer and a copy machine, were made available. Suddenly we found on our lists names from 21 states. A new member in Chicago wrote to say he had seen a note about us in a local environmental newsletter, and he had posted a notice about the network on three different computer bulletin boards. Each day brought more names from distant cities.</p>
        <p>Among the names were many who identified themselves as teachers. Some asked for information for classroom use. The requests have fathered a cooperative curriculum project. Through the network, educators nationwide will share ideas on how to bring pertinent concepts into the classrooms on all grade levels. The material will be distributed to any teacher who wants it.</p>
        <p>Rene Dubos, that wise doctor whose discovery of how to make antibiotics saved so many lives, wrote that ''trend is not destiny.'' We have the power to remake our world. We need not resign ourselves to live in the waste of our own creating and bemoan the loss of the earth we knew. The keys are knowledge and cooperation. To know an evil or a danger exists and not to do one's best to warn or protect the innocent is immoral. Now that I am part of the network I am sleeping better.</p>
