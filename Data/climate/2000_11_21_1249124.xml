        <p>Tracing Cocaine</p>
        <p>You don't need to be too much of a snob about French wine to tell a Sancerre from a Savennieres, or a St.-Estephe from a St.-Emilion. Even small taste hints -- a touch of flintiness here, some fruitiness there -- can be enough to pin down a wine's origin.</p>

        <p>Tracing Cocaine</p>
        <p>You don't need to be too much of a snob about French wine to tell a Sancerre from a Savennieres, or a St.-Estephe from a St.-Emilion. Even small taste hints -- a touch of flintiness here, some fruitiness there -- can be enough to pin down a wine's origin.</p>
        <p>Cocaine, according to new research, gives even subtler clues as to where it came from. This information should be of use, not to connoisseurs of the drug, but to law enforcement agents.</p>
        <p>Researchers from the University of Utah and the Drug Enforcement Administration, reporting in the journal Nature, say that by analyzing the chemical signature of a sample of cocaine, they can determine in what South American region the drug's raw material, coca leaves, were grown.</p>
        <p>The researchers analyzed the ratio of certain isotopes of carbon and nitrogen in the cocaine, recognizing that these ratios differ depending upon the conditions in which the coca was grown. The scientists also analyzed the trace alkaloid content of the drug. By combining the data, they were able to determine the origin of 96 percent of 200 cocaine samples.</p>
        <p>The researchers say the technique should be useful in the fight against cocaine trafficking. It can also help identify new cocaine-producing areas as they develop.</p>
        <p>Unfunny Laughing Gas</p>
        <p>They are getting a little light-headed off the west coast of India, but it is not a good thing. Researchers in the Indian city of Goa say that fertilizer runoff into the Arabian Sea may be contributing to the production of nitrous oxide, better known as laughing gas. This could have implications for climate change worldwide.</p>
        <p>In the monsoon season, the coastal waters of western India experience an upwelling, caused by a powerful current off the coastal shelf. This colder bottom water, which is naturally low in dissolved oxygen, is prevented from reaching the surface by a warmer top layer that is eutrophied, awash in plankton and algae due to the nitrogen-rich runoff. The lack of oxygen favors the formation of nitrous oxide by bacteria among decaying organic matter on the sea floor.</p>
        <p>This all occurs naturally, but in recent years the problem has gotten worse as the amount of agricultural runoff, and thus the eutrophication, has increased. The researchers, writing in Nature, say that as all the extra plankton and algae die off and fall to the bottom, they provide more organic matter for the bacteria to feed on, producing even more gas.</p>
        <p>Nitrous oxide is a powerful greenhouse gas, helping to trap the heat radiated from the earth. So this seasonal rise in production of the gas -- off India and possibly in similar oxygen-poor waters -- may affect global warming.</p>
        <p>New Whale Species</p>
        <p>Scientists say there is a new species of whale on the planet, but it is not as if some unknown behemoths were just found lurking under an iceberg somewhere. Rather, researchers from the Wildlife Conservation Society, the American Museum of Natural History and other organizations have determined that a population of right whales in the northern Pacific Ocean is genetically distinct.</p>
        <p>Until now, it had been thought that there were just two species of right whale -- one in the Southern Ocean and one found in both the Atlantic and Pacific in the north. But the morphological evidence upon which the two species were differentiated was slim -- a single bone in the skull.</p>
        <p>The new study, published in the journal Molecular Ecology, looked at the DNA from 380 whales and found that there was enough genetic variation to confirm that southern and northern are distinct species and that, among the northern whales, the Pacific whales are distinct from the Atlantic.</p>
        <p>Right whales are among the most endangered mammals in the world. Conservation efforts have mainly been directed toward northern right whales in the Atlantic; the new finding may encourage conservationists to look more closely at the Pacific population as well.</p>
