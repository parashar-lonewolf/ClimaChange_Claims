        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your July 28 editorial about recent efforts to improve the efficiency of sport utility vehicle engines states, ''The only way to reduce carbon dioxide, short of installing an engine that does not use fossil fuels, is to increase fuel efficiency.'' To this end, we should also promote the use of electric vehicles.</p>
        <p>Electric vehicles draw energy from electric plants that operate at about twice the efficiency of conventional car engines. While idling, electric automobiles neither draw power nor produce emissions. Not only would carbon dioxide emissions be reduced significantly by the use of electric vehicles, but other emissions would be similarly cut.</p>

        <p>The Postal Service recently announced plans to incorporate electric vehicles into its fleet. With enough support by industry and government, electric vehicles can have a great effect on the reduction of transportation-related pollution.</p>
