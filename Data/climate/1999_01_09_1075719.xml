        <p>The stock market is in record territory. The  economic expansion just hit its 93d month, making this the longest peacetime period of sustained growth in American history.</p>
        <p>And if President Clinton needed any more reason to be upbeat when he stepped before the Economic Club of Detroit today, he got it this morning when the Labor Department announced that the economy generated a startling total of 378,000 new jobs in December, pushing the unemployment rate down to 4.3 percent.</p>

        <p>The stock market is in record territory. The  economic expansion just hit its 93d month, making this the longest peacetime period of sustained growth in American history.</p>
        <p>And if President Clinton needed any more reason to be upbeat when he stepped before the Economic Club of Detroit today, he got it this morning when the Labor Department announced that the economy generated a startling total of 378,000 new jobs in December, pushing the unemployment rate down to 4.3 percent.</p>
        <p>As the Senate moved forward in its impeachment trial, the confluence of good economic news was just another reminder that this President remains either the most skillful overseer of the economy in decades, or the luckiest. If he escapes removal from office, it will be in no small part because of his high approval ratings, which are rooted in the nation's long run of prosperity.</p>
        <p>How much of the credit Mr. Clinton deserves is of course a matter of  debate. But he was not shy about claiming some today as he spoke to 1,500 members and guests of the Economic Club of Detroit, including hundreds of automobile industry executives and auto union leaders and most of Michigan's Democratic Congressional delegation.</p>
        <p>''We meet today at a time of an American economic renaissance,'' Mr. Clinton declared.</p>
        <p>He said the current expansion was more impressive than past ones for several reasons, among them that it had brought not only higher real incomes for most Americans but also minority unemployment rates that are at the lowest levels since the Government began keeping those  statistics in 1972.</p>
        <p>''This is a rising tide that is lifting all boats,'' Mr. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>The President spoke at Cobo Arena, site of the North American International Auto Show, the world's largest new-car exhibit, which he toured beforehand. The automobile industry is celebrating its second-best sales year ever, and the region's economy is booming.</p>
        <p>The White House, clearly recognizing how important the national economy's performance is to Mr. Clinton's survival in office, is making certain he is seen presiding over  announcements of the good news.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, he announced that the Administration expected a Federal budget surplus of at least $76 billion in the current fiscal year, the highest such figure ever in terms of absolute dollars (as opposed to percentage of the budget). And today he braved snowy runways in both Washington and Detroit to spotlight the latest favorable trends.</p>
        <p>White House aides insist that these are not events stage-managed solely to divert attention from the impeachment trial.</p>
        <p>''The President obviously understands what's going on in the Senate,'' said Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary. ''It's in the hands of the Senate. He's focusing on his agenda.''</p>
        <p>In his 35-minute address this afternoon, Mr. Clinton said that despite the steady flow of favorable developments, the Government still faced challenges in dealing with economic matters. He said the Administration must still grapple with caring for the elderly and providing an education to equip the nation's young to compete in the global high-technology economy. He said many inner cities and rural areas had yet to share in the benefits of the economic boom.</p>
        <p>He also said the huge volume and high speed of international capital flows posed a threat to the stability of nations around the world, whose problems could spread to the United States. And he noted that rapid growth posed environmental problems that, he said, must be met with new investment in energy-efficient technology and a reduced dependence on fossil fuels, which contribute to global warming.</p>
        <p>Many of the Economic Club's  members are Republicans, but they too appeared focused mostly on the economy and said they wanted the President's impeachment difficulties over as soon as possible. One big donor to Michigan Republicans, Heinz Prechter, chairman and founder of ASC Inc., a manufacturer of car sunroofs, said that while he was uncertain whether Mr. Clinton should be removed from office, he was sure that the current political furor should be brought to a quick conclusion.</p>
        <p>''I don't think that most of us in leadership positions can condone what President Clinton has done,'' Mr. Prechter said, ''but we can't have this public show go on forever.''</p>
        <p>Having finished his formal remarks, the President took several  questions from the audience, screened by his host, Dennis Archer, Mayor of Detroit and Mr. Clinton's choice to be co-chairman of the Democratic National Committee.</p>
        <p>If anyone in the audience wanted Mr. Clinton's views on the impeachment trial playing out in Washington, they were disappointed. The questions he took concerned alleged dumping of steel by Japan, Russia and Brazil (he is against it), the new Europe-wide currency, the euro (he is for it), and increased spending on the military (he is for it, to a point).</p>
        <p>The final question came from a 12-year-old, who wanted to know the person Mr. Clinton had met as President whom he most admired. Mr. Clinton named Yitzhak Rabin, the assassinated Israeli Prime Minister, and Nelson Mandela, human rights hero and President of South Africa.</p>
        <p>Outside the hall where Mr. Clinton spoke was a small congress of demonstrators.</p>
        <p>One held a sign reading, ''It's the perjury, stupid,'' a play on the slogan that gained currency within Mr. Clinton's 1992 campaign team, ''It's the economy, stupid.'' Another sign proclaimed, ''Impeach, Indict, Incarcerate.''</p>
        <p>But there were pro-Clinton demonstrators as well, one of whom held a placard reading, ''G.O.P.: Get Our President.''</p>
