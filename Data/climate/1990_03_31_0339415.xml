        <p>LEAD: It will be a tragic failure of vision and leadership if, because of the New York State budget crisis or other reasons, the single most important initiative of the Cuomo administration is permitted to founder.</p>
        <p>It will be a tragic failure of vision and leadership if, because of the New York State budget crisis or other reasons, the single most important initiative of the Cuomo administration is permitted to founder.</p>
        <p>The $1.9 billion Environmental Bond Act of 1990 was proposed earlier this year by Gov. Mario Cuomo for submission to the voters in November. Its most important provision now stands in danger of being compromised away or sabotaged altogether. For the sake of the future, this must not be allowed to hap-pen.</p>
        <p>New York State is facing an environmental emergency. Unlike global warming or ozone depletion, this is one that can be solved only by New Yorkers acting alone.</p>
        <p>This is an emergency that says: if we do not take strong action to protect and preserve the best of what is left of our environmental heritage -scenic landscapes, wild forest and wilderness areas, pristine lakes and streams, natural habitats, underground water reserves - we and our descendants will never have the opportunity again.</p>
        <p>For this reason, exactly half the bond act as the Governor originally proposed it - $950 million, to be expended over a 10-year period - is to be allocated to the state's most pressing environmental need: land acquisition.</p>
        <p>Under the Governor's plan, $175 million more was designated for municipal parks and historic preservation. The remainder was to be divided among other environmentally related activities, including $230 million for closing of landfills and recycling of solid wastes.</p>
        <p>Of those items, preservation of open land is far and away the most urgent. Every day, top-quality open space is going down in quantity and up in price.</p>
        <p>Even during a temporary economic slowdown, as at present, the continuous pressures of speculative real-estate development on such land -whether along the Hudson Valley ''greenway,'' in the pine barrens of eastern Long Island, the Finger Lakes, the Adirondacks, the Catskills or on the Ontario lake shore - are irresistible. The consequent destruction of natural values is irremediable.</p>
        <p>Because of lethargy, bureaucracy and inadequate funding, much that should have been protected for the future in these and other particularly vulnerable areas has already been lost.</p>
        <p>The state has totally exhausted its resources for direct acquisition of land. Not a dollar is left. The floating of long-term bonds is the most conservative, fiscally responsible and traditional way of funding the purchase of land or easements. New funding is essential now, while the opportunity to buy from willing sellers at relatively manageable prices still exists.</p>
        <p>The annual budget crisis provides no excuse for sabotaging the bond act, which is a long-range program that the state can well afford. It will average out in cost to the taxpayer in debt service less than $130 million annually over a 30-year term. This is peanuts in a $51 billion annual budget. There will be no cost at all next year.</p>
        <p>The $950 million allocated by Governor Cuomo to land acquisition will yield only $100 million annually, which is no more than what was spent last year. This is barely minimal, considering that at least $2.5 billion needs to be spent for such projects, to be acquired by the public for permanent protection.</p>
        <p>The strongest push for re-slicing the bond-act pie comes from politicians with their eyes on fat contracts for their constituents in the construction business. They want more than the $230 million already provided to municipalities for solid-waste management - and want to take it from land-acquisition funds.</p>
        <p>The mandatory closing of municipal landfills as well as the start-up of recycling programs and other public works indeed present municipalities with tough financial problems. But they furnish no justification for robbing the state of funds to insure the most fundamental aspect of its environmental future: the protection of sensitive natural areas.</p>
        <p>The political maneuverings over the budget and the bond act must not be allowed to shrink the present land-acquisition allotment so much that an environmentally enthusiastic public will come to look on the Environmental Quality Bond Act of 1990 as a fraud.</p>
