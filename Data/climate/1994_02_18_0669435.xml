        <p>Trees in the uncut parts of the world's tropical forests are apparently dying and being replaced more rapidly than in the past, according to a new analysis. The authors of the study said the most likely cause was a worldwide increase in carbon dioxide spewed into the atmosphere from smokestacks and vehicles.</p>
        <p>The faster turnover of trees may in turn cause a further increase in carbon dioxide, which traps heat in the atmosphere and could lead to global warming, the study reported. The authors said it might also accelerate the loss of tropical species.</p>
        <p>In a study unusual in its scope, two botanists at the Missouri Botanical Garden in St. Louis analyzed data from tree inventories conducted by many scientists over the last 40 years in Southeast Asia, Australia, Africa and Central and South America. They found a significant increase in the annual turnover rate of trees since at least 1960 in the tropics of both hemispheres, with a marked acceleration in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>The report of the botanists, Dr. Oliver L. Phillips and Dr. Alwyn H. Gentry, appears in today's issue of the journal Science. Role of Carbon Dioxide</p>
        <p>Carbon dioxide accelerates the growth and, in a mature forest, hastens the death of many plants. As trees mature faster and die sooner, Dr. Phillips said, they may be creating more gaps in the forest to be filled by light-seeking trees and woody vines, called lianas, that are adapted to disturbed areas. These, he said, grow even faster than the trees they replace, and because they are faster-growing, they are less dense. As a result, they absorb less carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than is released to it by the dead trees that are now lying on the forest floor.</p>
        <p>If that is happening, "the bottom line would be a net decrease in the carbon-sequestering ability of the worldwide tropical forest as a whole," Dr. Phillips said.</p>
        <p>Many climatologists fear that a buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could result in a serious and even catastrophic warming of the global climate some time in the next century.  Efforts to limit carbon dioxide emissions under a multinational treaty that takes effect next month are based on the assumption that tropical forests absorb more carbon dioxide than the Phillips-Gentry findings suggest.</p>
        <p>But if the forests' ability to remove carbon dioxide from the air is less than has been thought, then whatever warming occurs would presumably be worse than expected. Thus, more stringent measures to control carbon dioxide emissions would apparently be required.</p>
        <p>On the question of species loss, Dr. Phillips said it was possible that disturbance-thriving plants that succeeded the more rapidly dying tropical trees were expanding their reach and would eventually crowd out some shade-tolerant species. If this happened on a large scale, he said, it would worsen the loss of tropical species that many scientists believe is already under way because of the destruction of rain-forest habitat.</p>
        <p>Many conservation biologists are alarmed by the erosion of biological diversity in the tropics, where most of the world's species live, because they fear that it foretells a spasm of extinctions to rank with those of the remote geologic past.</p>
        <p>Today's paper is being published posthumously in the case of Dr. Gentry, one of the world's most noted field botanists, who was killed in a plane crash in Ecuador last August. "We wrote it together before he died," Dr. Phillips said. Dr. Gentry also established 7 of the 40 sample forest plots included in the study. The data from the 40 plots are the work of two generations of tropical botanists -- Filling in the Gaps</p>
        <p>The cause and effects of the more rapid turnover in tropical trees are somewhat speculative, Dr. Phillips acknowledged. But other scientists praised the data on tree turnover, the central part of the paper, as a major step forward in learning about physical links between climate and the world's plant and animal life, a highly important area about which comparatively little is known.</p>
        <p>While scientists simply do not know much about how the earth's living things affect climate and vice versa, the Phillips-Gentry paper shows "a compelling link between the two" and "brings us very much closer to understanding that linkage," said Dr. Stuart L. Pimm, an ecologist at the University of Tennessee. A commentary on the paper by Dr. Pimm and Andrew M. Sugden, the editor of Trends in Ecology and Evolution published by Elsevier Trends Journals in Cambridge, England, also appears in Science.</p>
        <p>To an ecologist, measuring the rate at which trees grow and die "is like taking the temperature" of an ecosystem, said Dr. Pimm, who described the increased turnover rate discerned by Dr. Phillips and Dr. Gentry as "the metaphorical equivalent of a fever."</p>
