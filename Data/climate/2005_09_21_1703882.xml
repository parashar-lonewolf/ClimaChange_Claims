        <p>The New York Times Company announced yesterday that it would cut its work force by 500 employees, including 45 in The Times's newsroom and 35 in the newsroom of The Boston Globe.</p>
        <p>The announcement came on the same day that Knight Ridder said it was cutting 100 editorial employees in Philadelphia: 75 from the newsroom at The Philadelphia Inquirer and 25 from The Philadelphia Daily News.</p>
        <p>The announcements by two of the biggest newspaper companies in the country reflect the uncertain outlook for newspapers as some readers and advertisers move to other media.</p>
        <p>''The climate change in the newspaper industry is going to take this kind of toll,'' said Colby Atwood, vice president of Borrell Associates, a media research firm. ''I expect to see more of this over the next 10-plus years as the newspaper industry adjusts to its smaller role in news dissemination and advertising.''</p>
        <p>The Times Company said the 500 job cuts there would begin in October and would take place over the following six to nine months.</p>
        <p>They will account for about 4 percent of the company's total work force, which was 12,300 people at the end of 2004. This represents the largest cuts for the company since 2001, when the bursting of the technology bubble prompted a 9 percent reduction of a work force of 13,750.</p>
        <p>In this round, the Times newsroom will lose 3.75 percent of its 1,200 employees, and The Boston Globe will lose about 6 percent of its newsroom staff of 550.</p>
        <p>The company said half of the 500 job cuts would come from The New York Times Media Group, which includes The Times and The International Herald Tribune. Catherine J. Mathis, a spokeswoman for the company, said she had no breakdown of how many jobs The International Herald Tribune might lose. The company's regional newspapers, television stations and corporate staff will lose about 90 jobs.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mathis did say the cuts would be made through a combination of buyouts and layoffs. The company reduced its staff by 200 jobs earlier this year, largely through buyouts.</p>
        <p>Bill Keller, executive editor of The Times, said in a statement that he hoped to achieve the 45 newsroom cuts through voluntary severance deals and attrition and by curbing the use of temporary employees, rather than through layoffs. He also announced a hiring freeze, effective immediately.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the company said it expected its third-quarter earnings to be lower than analysts predicted. It said it expected earnings of 11 cents to 14 cents a share. Analysts had predicted 25 cents a share, according to Thomson First Call. Even that was well below the 33 cents a share the company earned last year.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mathis said the analysts' estimates largely excluded the costs associated with the job cuts earlier this year. Those costs, which were $12 million to $14 million, were higher because more people took the buyouts than had been expected.</p>
        <p>The company also scaled back its estimates of revenues from advertising and circulation for the year. It said advertising revenue would increase in the low single digits; it had forecast growth in the low to mid-single digits. And it said circulation revenue would be flat to down slightly; earlier it said it would be flat.</p>
        <p>Janet L. Robinson, the company president and chief executive, said in a statement that advertising for September ''has been challenging and visibility remains limited.''</p>
        <p>''We continue to benefit from very strong double-digit advertising growth at our digital operations, particularly About.com,'' she said. ''But elsewhere, advertising is weaker than expected.''</p>
        <p>The company said that for August, advertising revenue increased 1.7 percent and total company revenue increased 0.6 percent compared with August 2004. The increases were modest because last year the company benefited from having the Republican National Convention in New York and the Democratic convention in Boston.</p>
        <p>Times Company shares closed at $32.13, and fell about 2 percent in after-hours trading.</p>
        <p>In Philadelphia, Joe Natoli, the publisher of Philadelphia Newspapers Inc., cited the loss of advertising from a large regional department store, Strawbridge's, as a factor in the company's revenue shortfall. Strawbridge's was acquired by Federated Department Stores, the largest department store company in the country, which already advertises in the Philadelphia papers. Also, Merrill Lynch says that Federated has started to shift advertising spending away from newspapers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Natoli said he hoped to achieve the savings through voluntary buyouts, but failing that, ''there will be newsroom layoffs.''</p>
        <p>The papers have taken several steps to try to avoid staff cuts, he said, but there is less money coming in this year than last year. More worrisome, he said, ''our revenues have been essentially flat for the last several years.''</p>
        <p>The Inquirer's loss of 75 jobs means a 15 percent cut in its newsroom of 506 people; The Daily News's loss of 25 jobs is a 19 percent cut in its newsroom of 130 people.</p>
        <p>''The mood here is grim,'' said Tom Ferrick Jr., a metro columnist at The Inquirer and former officer in the Newspaper Guild union.</p>
        <p>''What was a surprise was the depth of the cuts, and it's pretty obvious they won't get them all through buyouts,'' he said, adding that except for a handful of layoffs last year, he could not remember any layoffs at the paper in his 29 years there.</p>
        <p>Three years ago, he said, the paper had hired 52 young reporters as part of an expansion into the suburbs. Now, he said, those people in their 20's and 30's would be the ones laid off after older people take the buyouts. He said this would hurt the paper further because the younger employees not only were less expensive for the paper but also were an investment in the future.</p>
        <p>John Morton, a newspaper industry analyst, said that one of the many business and social trends working against newspapers was public ownership of newspaper companies.</p>
        <p>''Wall Street appreciates cost-cutting and improving margins and increased profitability,'' he said. ''Those are the things that make them dance a jig at night. They put that kind of pressure on publicly owned companies, and newspapers are no more immune to that than anybody else. These cuts and layoffs are known as dancing to Wall Street's tune.''</p>
