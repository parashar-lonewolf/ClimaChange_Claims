        <p>LEAD: The Senate failed by three votes to cut off debate today on a bill that would require car makers to improve fuel efficiency significantly. The vote in effect kills the measure in this session of Congress.</p>
        <p>The Senate failed by three votes to cut off debate today on a bill that would require car makers to improve fuel efficiency significantly. The vote in effect kills the measure in this session of Congress.</p>
        <p>It was the first legislative test of a measure intended to reduce American dependence on foreign oil since the start of the Persian Gulf crisis.</p>
        <p>The auto industry and the Bush Administration lobbied heavily against the bill, saying it would do little to clean up the environment and would exact a major financial toll on car makers.</p>
        <p>In a vote of 57 to 42, the Senate rejected a petition that the bill be brought to a vote. Sixty votes were needed to cut off debate. #40 Miles to the Gallon The legislation would require that new cars sold in this country attain a level of fuel use averaging about 40 miles to the gallon by the year 2001. Current law generally requires that auto makers sell cars that get an average of 27.5 miles to the gallon.</p>
        <p>Although the plan took on added interest because of the Middle East conflict, it was considered an effort to curb air pollution when it was introduced last year.</p>
        <p>The bill's chief sponsor, Senator Richard H. Bryan, said the Senate's action was ''a small and shortsighted victory against our struggle for a real energy conservation policy.'' Although Senate leaders said they did not plan to take up the matter again this year, Mr. Bryan vowed to introduce a similar bill when Congress returns in January.</p>
        <p>''Clearly the auto industry mounted a massive campaign against it,'' said Mr. Bryan, a Nevada Democrat. ''They need to ask themselves: What is their answer to every parent in America whose son or daughter is in the Middle East because of our oil dependence? What are they proposing to make us less vulnerable on foreign oil and vulnerable to the potential instability in the Middle East?''</p>
        <p>Environmental groups were less restrained in expressing their disappointment. ''Today the gas guzzler won and they're popping the champagne corks in Saddam Hussein's palace,'' said Daniel F. Becker, who heads the Sierra Club's energy and global warming program.</p>
        <p>'Horrendously Expensive'</p>
        <p>But the leading opponent of the bill, Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, said its passage would place a ''horrendously expensive'' burden on auto makers. He said manufacturers would have no choice but to build smaller cars, which would lead to increased traffic deaths.</p>
        <p>''The automobile industry is under a considerable amount of stress these days,'' he said. ''You can't just wave a wand and impose massive costs on a major part of the economy without weighing the implications very carefully.'' He disputed Mr. Bryan's contention that the bill was a step toward developing a national energy plan and called the plan ''a piecemeal strategy.''</p>
        <p>The bill's backers said the auto makers could meet the new fuel-use standards by altering the design of the engine combustion system to stress fuel efficiency over power or by reducing the size of the vehicles. But manufacturers argued that the proposed new standards were unrealistic and that the technology needed to meet the requirements could not be developed quickly enough to comply with the law.</p>
        <p>Even if the bill had not been stopped in the Senate, its prospects were not strong. In the House, it probably would have had difficulty getting past the Energy and Commerce Committee, headed by Representative John D. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who is a staunch backer of the auto industry.</p>
        <p>Administration Opposed It</p>
        <p>And Administration officials lobbied vigorously against the bill, threatening a Presidential veto.</p>
        <p>''We do not believe that recent events in Kuwait should cause us to rush ahead with ill-considered policies,'' Samuel K. Skinner, the Secretary of Transportation, and James D. Watkins, the Secretary of Energy, asserted in a recent letter to the Senator majority leader, George J. Mitchell, Democrat of Maine. They said their overriding concern was that highway safety would be compromised.</p>
        <p>The heavy lobbying campaign appeared to pay off. In the first test of the proposal last month, the Senate voted 68 to 28 to limit debate - 11 votes more than today.</p>
        <p>Besides raising the fuel-use standards, the bill would double penalties for repeated violations of the standards; provide a fuel economy credit for makers of small passenger cars that are equipped with airbags, and require reports to Congress on the accuracy of tests of vehicle fuel economy.</p>
