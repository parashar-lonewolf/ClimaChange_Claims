        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"Fresh Air for the Space Agency," your optimistic March 13 editorial about the nomination of Daniel Goldin to lead the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, is premature. His opinions and political abilities are largely unknown, as has been the case in other Bush nominations where commitment to a narrow point of view turned out to be the reason for the nomination. Mr. Goldin's technical experience with "Star Wars" is also not particularly apt background for NASA's problems.</p>
        <p>Our civilian space agency carries out work in human space flight, earth remote sensing and space science. Earth remote sensing is of unquestioned importance because of weather, ozone and climate change questions. Mr. Goldin's experience may be useful in deciding the mix of missions, small and large, in this area.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"Fresh Air for the Space Agency," your optimistic March 13 editorial about the nomination of Daniel Goldin to lead the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, is premature. His opinions and political abilities are largely unknown, as has been the case in other Bush nominations where commitment to a narrow point of view turned out to be the reason for the nomination. Mr. Goldin's technical experience with "Star Wars" is also not particularly apt background for NASA's problems.</p>
        <p>Our civilian space agency carries out work in human space flight, earth remote sensing and space science. Earth remote sensing is of unquestioned importance because of weather, ozone and climate change questions. Mr. Goldin's experience may be useful in deciding the mix of missions, small and large, in this area.</p>
        <p>Space science is very different. It involves probes to the planets and orbiting instruments to detect the farthest reaches of the universe. It is done for reasons of curiosity and exploration. The human mind wishes to know about the universe. It is a luxury. The people, the voters, must decide if they wish to support space science to enhance their lives.</p>
        <p>Finally, by far the most expensive part of NASA activities is human space flight. Its purpose is adventure, and nothing more. It also is a luxury.</p>
        <p>NASA is caught in a painful financial squeeze because human space flight programs, including the space station and preparations for a return to the moon, are forcing cost cutting and cancellations in space science and earth monitoring. Scientific data, representing real increases of human knowledge, are being pushed aside for purposes of high adventure.</p>
        <p>Other decisions are also being made, such as the puzzling refusal to reduce costs by purchasing Russian launch vehicles. These choices come about under direction of Vice President Quayle and the National Space Council, despite thoughtful studies (like the Augustine Report) and without national debate. Last year's Congressional vote on the space station was misconstrued by most representatives as simply a vote for or against NASA, and most, of course, voted for it. The agency has had many fine accomplishments.</p>
        <p>We need open debate about NASA's activities, and we need an administrator with broad and balanced views to carry out the agency's multiple goals. Let us hope the confirmation process will expose the choices being made. PETER J. GIERASCH Ithaca, N.Y., March 14, 1992 The writer is a professor of astronomy and director of Cornell University's Center for Radiophysics and Space Research.</p>
