        <p>The Organic Machine The Remaking of the Columbia River  By Richard White  130 pages. Hill &amp; Wang. $17.95.  Our Natural History The Lessons of Lewis and Clark  By Daniel B. Botkin  300 pages. Grosset/Putnam. $25.95.</p>
        <p>John Muir's most famous epigram has to do with the inherent value of untouched Nature, "the great fresh unblighted, unredeemed wilderness." It was a moving statement coming from a pioneering environmentalist, one whom later writers have kept in mind as they tried to figure out the proper relationship between human culture and the natural world. But for Richard White and Daniel B. Botkin, the authors of two valuable new books on the subject of man and nature, Muir's rhapsodies about wildness as the hope of the world are unrealistic as guides to action or understanding.</p>
        <p>Both writers, however, take what they portray as an unromantic, illusion-and-dogma-free approach to the environment. Their shared basic premise is not Muir's concept of a natural world that needs to be left uncontaminated by man, but Ralph Waldo Emerson's notion of nature as receptive to human transformation. Mr. White, a professor of history at the University of Washington, cites Emerson specifically. His history of the Columbia River seeks "to blur boundaries, emphasize impurity." To understand "what we have done and how we have acted in nature," we might read more Emerson and less Muir, Mr. White advises. "We might want to look for the natural in the dam and the unnatural in the salmon."</p>
        <p>Mr. White's "Organic Machine" is a compact and suggestive reflection on those questions with numerous insights and a knack for exposing unities even while exposing differences. In their ways, Indians and white men understood the river by giving it their labor. Like humans, rivers work, Mr. White writes: "For much of human history, work and energy have linked humans and rivers, humans and nature." The Indians, fearful that the salmon would stop running, banned women from the river, believing that menstrual blood offended the fish. The white men created factories where Chinese immigrants worked, banning them in effect from direct contact with the river.</p>
        <p>Throughout his narrative, Mr. White seems intent on showing that the effort to transform nature is not, as it is fashionably deemed to be in some academic circles, a "rape," an act of capitalist avarice. Farmers and dam builders, he says, even the operators of aluminum smelters, functioned within the intellectual vision of Emerson and, later, of Lewis Mumford, an acolyte of hydroelectric power, which, he believed, would purify society, freeing both human labor and nature.</p>
        <p>That is no doubt a useful view, and yet two problems affect Mr. White's otherwise commendable book. One is stylistic. Mr. White is a very good writer but he meditates too often in the realm of the vaguely poetic, leaving the reader puzzled sometimes about his purpose. Second, one can figure out his riddle about the natural in the dam and the unnatural in the salmon, but it is never clear how keeping those things in mind will help us in the future, or, indeed, exactly who with any real power or influence holds to a contrary vision.</p>
        <p>Indeed, what is most powerful in Mr. White's book is his description of the way in which the Emersonian and Mumfordian visions produced not what the two thinkers predicted, but its opposite. The Columbia River dams, Mr. White reminds us, may have been built with an emphasis on "mimicking and not conquering nature" and freeing farmers and workers from drudgery, but in the end, they helped to concentrate wealth, not to redistribute it, and they spoiled the river for the salmon. Drastically reduced in number, salmon are now created artificially, bred in hatcheries, barged down the river, schematized on computer models, all at enormous expense.</p>
        <p>This seems to be what Mr. White means by the unnatural in salmon, especially because the work of artificial breeding is being done in large part for sentimental reasons, to sustain the salmon as "a cultural talisman," when the truth is that the Columbia is now a different river, a river for carp and shad, not for chinook, sockeye and steelhead.</p>
        <p>The lesson is that human intervention of a kind of post-Emersonian type is inevitable and necessary. "To call for a return to nature is posturing," Mr. White writes, arguing against unnamed intellectual opponents who are, apparently, making that call. But he does not tell us what specifically to do. Is the lesson that we should forget about salmon on the Columbia, and be content with shad and carp? Should the dams, however well-intentioned, not have been built?</p>
        <p>Mr. Botkin strikes some of the same themes as Mr. White, especially in his call to understand man and nature "without dogma, without romanticism, without fantasy," though his book has the same fault of arguing against putative purists and moralists who remain unnamed. In "Our Natural History," Mr. Botkin addresses some specific environmental problems: how, for example, to measure the carbon-storage capacity of the forests so as to better understand possible ways of countering the greenhouse effect. At the same time, he looks for lessons in the journals of Lewis and Clark when that intrepid pair explored the newly acquired Louisiana Territory from 1804 to 1806.</p>
        <p>The "lessons" Mr. Botkin draws come from contrasting what the early explorers found about the natural world with what exists today. "What we appreciate about environment and believe to be unaffected by human beings is actually the product of long, human-induced changes in the landscape," Mr. Botkin writes. It is false, he writes, and not conducive to environmental solutions to maintain that nature, left to its own devices, represents a classic balance, and that everything will right itself if only people get out of the way.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Botkin talks about buffalo and salmon, grizzlies and wolves, his common-sense approach is persuasive. The goal, he argues, is not to restore a species to its "natural" population, because there is no such thing. A realistic goal would be figuring out what is a "minimum viable population" for each creature. In reality, he argues, "there is no single condition that is best for all of life," because nature itself is always changing, uncertain, full of hazards.</p>
        <p>Some of the lessons Mr. Botkin draws are less than dazzling. For example, after a generally interesting chapter on grizzlies, during which he uses the Lewis and Clark diaries to estimate the grizzly bear population on the eve of European settlement, he asks "what the grizzlies tell us." The answer is platitudinous: They tell us that "our knowledge remains terribly limited" and that "clear, objective, historical records can be a great help to us."</p>
        <p>Still, by taking the long view of specific problems, and trying to grasp how each issue has presented itself over time, Mr. Botkin, like Mr. Smith, introduces a welcome realism into the debate. There may be fewer people out there longing for the restoration of Muirian wildness than these writers believe, but for those who do hold to simplistic visions of nature-the-pure and man-the-sinful, these two books will be challenging antidotes.</p>
