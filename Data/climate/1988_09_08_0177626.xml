        <p>LEAD: IF the ''greenhouse effect'' pushes temperatures up and rainfall down, which way will energy stocks move? Some analysts on Wall Street believe a global rise in temperatures could attract new interest in fuels and energy technologies that produce little of the ''greenhouse gases.''</p>
        <p>IF the ''greenhouse effect'' pushes temperatures up and rainfall down, which way will energy stocks move? Some analysts on Wall Street believe a global rise in temperatures could attract new interest in fuels and energy technologies that produce little of the ''greenhouse gases.''</p>
        <p>The logical long-term prospects, analysts say, are companies that deliver natural gas, which creates fewer greenhouse-causing gases than oil or coal do, and companies that make electricity from solar or nuclear power, which produces nearly no greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>''Solar and natural gas will be the energy of choice for the next 100 years,'' said Ernest C. Kiehne of Legg Mason Wood Walker, ''but I don't know how to play solar.'' Investment opportunities in that area are thin because the commercial market is small and much of the research is done at nonprofit institutions.</p>
        <p>In natural gas, he recommends the Coastal Corporation, which is a natural gas producer and gas pipeline operator, and the USX Corporation, whose Texas Oil and Gas Corporation subsidiary is a leading driller of natural gas wells.</p>
        <p>Charles T. Maxwell of Cyrus J. Lawrence also believes that ''in the end the gas business is going to be, per dollar invested, more attractive than the oil business'' because of various pollution problems that are better-established hazards than the greenhouse effect, although he says that, too, may play a role in the longer term. In addition, he said, because natural gas is a domestic fuel, it will become more attractive as more oil is imported.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maxwell does not foresee a quick end to the present depression in natural gas prices, but he believes the long-term prospects are better.</p>
        <p>''The play is in Canada on gas; that's where the undrilled areas lie,'' he said. He said Shell of Canada, with a capable exploration department and good financing, would perform well in the next 10 years.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, however, the sun is the long-term source of energy. Most researchers are now betting on photovoltaic cells, the kind commonly found in calculators and watches. Only two publicly traded American companies now make these cells.</p>
        <p>The photovoltaic specialist is the Chronar Corporation of Princeton, N.J., which has production capacity of 5 megawatts a year and 13.2 megawatts of production capacity under construction. That includes a 10-megawatt plant it recently announced plans to build with help from the national pension fund of the Sheet Metal Workers' International Association; PG&amp;E Enterprises, a subsidiary of the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, and the Bechtel Development Company.</p>
        <p>In the solar industry, that 18.2 megawatts of production capacity is large, although the cells it could produce each year would make an electric plant big enough to supply only about 9,000 households -when the sun is shining.</p>
        <p>The company's cells are now used in such specialty applications as charging batteries for patio and walkway lights or for flashlights. The greenhouse effect has ''certainly got to be a long-term plus'' for Chronar, said Russell E. Miller, an analyst at Alex. Brown &amp; Sons of Baltimore. But he added, ''It usually takes an awful long time to turn basic energy supplies around.''</p>
        <p>Another prominent solar company is ARCO Solar of Camarillo, Calif., which describes itself as the world's leading producer of photovoltaic energy devices. But it represents only a tiny portion of the business of its corporate parent, the Atlantic Richfield Company, whose fortunes will be determined mainly by its oil and gas operations.</p>
        <p>The alternative to photovoltaics is thermal-electric solar power. It has been established on a modest scale by Luz International Ltd. It has five plants now operating, with a capacity of 160 megawatts, and two more 30-megawatt units scheduled to go into service by the end of the year. The new units cost $120 million each.</p>
        <p>Luz's plants use mirrors to concentrate the sun's light on pipes in which fluid is heated. They begin generating 45 minutes after sunrise, and use natural gas as a heat supplement in cloudy periods.</p>
        <p>Luz will go public next year or in 1990, according to Ross D. Ain, a director and a former staff member at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Current investors include the Prudential Insurance Company and corporate affiliates of the Newark-based Public Service Electric and Gas Company, Potomac Electric Power Company, Baltimore Gas and Electric Company, Virginia Electric Power Company and several smaller utilities.</p>
        <p>The other energy source that has attracted renewed interest is nuclear power, although few analysts predict that utilities, burned by cost overruns in recent years, will rush out to build more plants until they are assured of technological and regulatory improvements.</p>
        <p>''We're talking years down the line here,'' said Albert E. Turner, an analyst at Duff &amp; Phelps. ''But it would mean a lot of real business for them.''</p>
        <p>The two biggest manufacturers of reactor components in this country were the Westinghouse Electric Corporation and the General Electric Company. The nuclear divisions of both companies ''have been billion-dollar enterprises in the past,'' Mr. Turner said. ''Those segments produce nothing now in terms of profits.''</p>
        <p>If reactors make a comeback, he said, the focus is clear: ''There's a very small fraternity of companies that can build nuclear plants.''</p>
