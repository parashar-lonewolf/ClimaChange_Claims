        <p>If the world is going to reduce the quantity of greenhouse gases spewed into the atmosphere, every industry has to find ways to use energy more efficiently.

        <p>If the world is going to reduce the quantity of greenhouse gases spewed into the atmosphere, every industry has to find ways to use energy more efficiently. One of the most common-sense proposals we have heard lately comes from Sir Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic airline.</p>
        <p>As passengers on late-departing flights are only too aware, jets taxi between the gate and the runway sometimes for an hour or longer. And they do it with their giant engines burning fuel the entire time. Sir Richard proposes simply that an aircraft's engines remain off until the plane is ready for takeoff.</p>
        <p>Under his proposal, tugs would pull the airplanes from the gates to a holding area near the end of the runway. This would reduce the pollution generated by the waiting planes. Not only does that help the effort against global warming, it also benefits the health of those living nearby.</p>
        <p>Like any new system, there would be kinks to work out, such as how to power systems like air-conditioning or heating while the plane waited. The biggest hurdle of all may be bureaucratic, because of the many different companies and regulatory bodies represented at each location. But airlines should get behind the proposal because it would save fuel, which in the end would mean saving money.</p>
        <p>Virgin says it is working with London's Gatwick and Heathrow airports to try to get trial programs up and running. We hope that Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark get involved as well. An official at the Port Authority said it would embrace the opportunity, and pointed out that the authority has applied for a grant to acquire electric-powered tow vehicles. With a little cooperation, substantial reductions in airport ground pollution are within reach.</p>
        <p>When Sir Richard pledged last week to invest $3 billion over 10 years to fight global warming, some questioned whether it was one of his many publicity stunts. This new proposal should allay doubts about his commitment and seriousness. Ultimately, private enterprise must play a critical role in moving away from an economy powered by fossil fuels and toward a sustainable one run on alternative power sources. The more entrepreneurs like the brash Sir Richard get involved in green business, the faster we will end our reliance on petroleum.</p>
        <p>But the actions of private citizens and businesses do not absolve the government of responsibility to act decisively. The United States government still needs to regulate emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases. Only when there is a price associated with polluting the atmosphere with carbon dioxide will the clean-energy businesses supported by people like Sir Richard really take off.</p>
