        <p>LAST summer's heat wave and erratic rainfall patterns focused attention on the ''greenhouse effect'' that some scientists predict will happen as a result of burning fossil fuels. In response, Lisa Newton, the director of applied ethics and environmental studies programs at Fairfield University, says it is imperative that state and Federal governments design economic incentives that would make mass transportation and alternative forms of energy more attractive.</p>
        <p>''One of the most effective ways to change our environmentally destructive patterns,'' she said ''is by raising the costs of doing things in an environmentally unsound way.''</p>
        <p>Since 1986, Dr. Newton has brought together business, government, science, law and environmental experts through a series of lectures on the environment and an environmental forum held last spring at the university.</p>
        <p>In an interview at her Fairfield University office, Dr. Newton talked about how economic incentives can be used as measures to protect the environment. Here are some excerpts from the conversation:</p>
        <p>Q. Is there an overall theme or ethic to help guide us in solving our environmental problems?</p>
        <p>A. It's one thing to educate people to love nature or to conserve, that is, inculcate a land ethic, but that isn't going to change their habits. Because we continue to consume more and more of our natural resources, we're also producing more wastes.</p>
        <p>Acid rain and the greenhouse effect, which were once speculations in the ecological textbooks, are now obvious fact. Our problem now becomes not how can we cut back on pollution, but rather, how do we stop what we're doing and reverse the process, somehow restoring what we've destroyed.</p>
        <p>The first thing we have to understand is that blaming others won't get us anywhere. Environmentalists have blamed industry for the pollution, urging them to stop making plastics or pesticides rather than turning to the farmer who uses those pesticides, or the customer who uses Styrofoam. This leads to an anti-business ethic which does nobody any good. We're dealing with a free market system, therefore the blame for the production, sale and use of any product is spread equally across society.</p>
        <p>Q. What do you see as the first step toward restoring the environment?</p>
        <p>A. What we have to do is adopt a Manhattan Project approach. It must be made clear that this is a problem that has to be solved and we need a unified national effort to do it. This can't be done by shooting slings and arrows at industry. It has to be done by changing the whole nature of the market, by changing consumer demand.</p>
        <p>To do this we have to start by changing the pattern of economic incentives. Right now these incentives seem to reward certain kinds of anti-environmental behavior; we need to reform those structures.</p>
        <p>Q. How do economic incentives work?</p>
        <p>A. First, when we calculate the costs of things we have to calculate the real costs and the whole costs. For example, let's take the costs of getting to work by car versus the costs of getting to work by train. This has to include not just the price of the gas, the wear and tear on your car, but also the frustration of driving around the train station trying to find a parking spot, getting out of your car on a sleeting day in winter and running the length of the platform, then failing to catch the train just as it's pulling out. It's got to count your discomfort as you huddle waiting for the next train. Then suppose you're a heavy smoker. It's got to count the costs of going all the way to work without having a cigarette.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, when you drive your car, you've got the luxury of listening to your own music, climate control, smoking if you wish, and let's not forget cellular telephones. This has drastically reduced the cost of taking your car to work because the one major cost was the time spent in traffic jams while you were missing phone calls. Now with a car phone you've got your office in your car.</p>
        <p>Thus by Connecticut's licensing cellular telephones, it gave people more of an incentive to drive to work instead using mass transit. When Metro-North banned smoking, it took away for smokers even more of the incentive for taking the train to work. You've got to take these things into consideration if you want to get people to take mass transit. So far that hasn't been done.</p>
        <p>Q. What kinds of incentives would encourage people to take mass transit?</p>
        <p>A. One of the first steps we can take to counter the costs of driving to work is to raise the price of gasoline. That done, all of the sudden mass transit is going to look a lot more attractive. With more people taking the train, perhaps that would motivate the railroads to add more cars and improve the services such as the air conditioning and heating. Other services might also be expanded like commuter vans that pick up people at their home and take them to and from the office.</p>
        <p>In other words, if we can change the demand by making mass transit more cost effective for the consumer, then new economies will naturally be created. What we're in fact doing is changing the incentive by raising the costs of doing things in an environmentally unsound way. I have faith that when we make our bad habits too expensive to continue, we will find ways to practice good habits.</p>
        <p>Q. How could economic incentives be applied to other environmental problems?</p>
        <p>A. The other thing we have to change immediately is the energy picture. The acidification of our lakes and the accretion of the greenhouse effect should give us the incentive to find other energy sources before the next century besides that of burning fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>I think everyone would agree that solar energy is the wave of the future. Again, we must take the Manhattan Project approach by calling on experts to speed up the development of solar and other alternative forms of energy. We have the expertise to get satellites in space, which in turn would carry lasers that could beam down solar energy to run our power plants. If we can get to the point where we can use solar energy to run our power plants, we should be able to use it for other purposes, such as powering electric cars.</p>
        <p>Q. Since it will take several years to design and place this solar technology, how do you propose that we solve our energy problems in the meantime?</p>
        <p>A. Unfortunately there are a lot of dead trees out there, so we've got to stop the pollution now. Although we've had some serious problems with nuclear power, I think the move will be to use that source. We know that in France there's an almost total reliance on nuclear power. They have safe facilities run by an elite corps of engineers.  Although we've had some industrial accidents, they are nothing compared with other accidents fairly common in other industries, and if we ever compared the fatalities of nuclear accidents with coal mining accidents, we'd shut every coal mine down. Obviously we use a double standard when we talk about the safety of nuclear power. It will take a decade or so to launch solar energy. We could probably have nuclear reactors operating and producing in a year. That would save us nine years of pollutants pouring into the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Q. What incentives can we give industry to use nonpolluting technologies?</p>
        <p>A. Where industry sees that it is to their interest, they will certainly support environmental causes. Any company will put in pollution devices to control its polluting effluents into local streams or to control its emissions into the air as long as a law is passed requiring its competitors to do likewise. But it would be suicidal for a company to take on pollution measures all by itself. Companies may be obliged to install pollution control measures, but they have to ask what costs they will absorb while their competitors are not absorbing them.</p>
        <p>Q. How can we apply economic incentives to waste disposal?</p>
        <p>A. Waste disposal will be the least easy to control because you're going to have to radically change the behavior of homeowners and business owners. Basically, it comes down to separating garbage. We've got to start separating paper for recycling, and plastics and aluminum for special disposal.</p>
        <p>In some areas this has been done by issuing different colored trash cans for 50 cents apiece to separate different kinds of wastes. Right now there is no quick and easy way to get people do this. Eventually it may require strict government action, such as imposing fines to get people to comply.</p>
        <p>Q. What about using incentives to curtail commercial or residential development of our wilderness?</p>
        <p>A. Even housing seems to be remarkably susceptible to economic incentives. When the price of oil went up, the desire to own a large house went down. When the price goes down, people build larger homes.</p>
        <p>As for preserving open space, the way to protect land is to put it into private hands. I think the only approach that has any hope for the long term is the Nature Conservancy and other private land trusts. So far, they've developed some magnificent reserves.</p>
        <p>Q. How do we strike a balance between economic growth and protecting the environment?</p>
        <p>A. We won't have to sacrifice economic growth because there'll be new markets, such as the solar industry, to take the place of old ones. Trash disposal is going to be one of our major industries if you consider recycling, resource and recovery facilities, and excavating land fills. Further down the road we may see companies that would channel the organic trash of the suburban household to the town's compost heap.</p>
        <p>If our demands as consumers change, industry will respond by creating new markets. But in order for us to change our demands, we're going to have to change our behavior. For that we're going to need real live economic incentives.</p>
