        <p>A group of shareholders that includes the Connecticut treasurer's office and several religious organizations have begun a campaign to compel the largest electric utilities in the nation to publish information about liabilities they might face because of their emission of gases that contribute to global warming.</p>
        <p>Led by the State of Connecticut Plans and Trust Fund and members of the New York-based Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, the shareholder coalition has filed resolutions to be voted upon at the annual meetings later this year of American Electric Power, the Southern Company, Xcel Energy Inc., the TXU Corporation and the Cinergy Corporation.</p>
        <p>The shareholders contend that there are hidden risks at the large power companies because of their release of carbon dioxide, which is widely thought to be linked to global warming, and the pollutants sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury. They contend that companies could face risks if emissions of carbon dioxide were regulated and limited, which many environmentalists and some power companies think is inevitable. They also assert that the electric utilities may have to grapple with litigation linked to the emissions.</p>
        <p>''In American Electric Power's own disclosure to the S.E.C., they acknowledge climate change as a risk factor,'' said Denise L. Nappier, the Connecticut treasurer. ''What they haven't done, and what most utility companies haven't done, so far, is present to their shareholders a comprehensive assessment of these risks and how they plan to address them.''</p>
        <p>American Electric Power, the nation's largest utility, has filed a letter seeking no action against it from the Securities and Exchange Commission if it chooses not to include the shareholder resolution in the proxy statement for its annual meeting. A company spokeswoman said that American Electric Power already provided the kind of information the shareholders seek, and accused them of seeking to stop the burning of fossil fuels for electricity generation.</p>
        <p>But the investors contend that they seek disclosure of information rather than a radical change in business practices.</p>
