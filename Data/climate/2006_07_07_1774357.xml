        <p>A surge in wildfires in the mountains of the West since the 1980's, particularly the northern Rockies, appears to have been caused mainly by the warming climate, a new study says. Researchers from several universities, writing in the online journal Scienceexpress.org, sifted records on forest fires and climate conditions and found that human activities like timber cutting were less important than factors like a shortening snow season and rising summer temperatures, particularly in forests more than a mile high. The scientists said further warming from the buildup of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide was likely to lengthen the Western fire season.</p>
