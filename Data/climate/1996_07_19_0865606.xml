        <p>Encouraged by a United States policy shift, government ministers today urged  industrialized nations to make legally binding commitments to reduce so-called greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>A joint statement issued at a conference on climate changes said emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other heat-trapping gases must be significantly reduced before the year 2020, and legal instruments are needed to enforce the measures.</p>
        <p>The United States announced on Wednesday that it was reversing its policy of voluntary reductions and would commit itself to legally binding cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
        <p>The shift was welcomed by environmentalists as a significant step following the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, when governments first agreed to cut such emissions to 1990 levels by 2000.</p>
        <p>"Support from the United States to legally binding measures has put teeth" into the declaration, said Peter DeBrine, spokesman for the World Wide Fund for  Nature, the environmental organization known as the World Wildlife Fund in the United States and Canada.</p>
        <p>The governments also endorsed the latest scientific report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which found signs of a "discernible human influence" on the global climate.</p>
        <p>Representatives of about 150 governments are attending the two-week conference. Negotiations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions have been under way since last year. The talks are to be completed late next year.</p>
        <p>The joint declaration at the interim meeting here said increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere "will lead to dangerous interference with the climate system," including "significant, often adverse, impacts on food supply and water resources, and on human health."</p>
        <p>Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide -- produced by burning oil or coal and in agriculture -- contribute to a warming of the atmosphere by trapping the sun's heat.</p>
        <p>The United Nations report researched by more than 2,000 scientists predicted  the earth's temperature would rise by 2 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century.</p>
