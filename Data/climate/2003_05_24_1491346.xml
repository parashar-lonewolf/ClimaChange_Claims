        <p>If NASA had known immediately that the Columbia was damaged on liftoff, it might have sent the shuttle Atlantis on a rescue mission, the chairman of the board investigating the accident said today. But he would not characterize the chance of success.</p>
        <p>At the time of the Columbia's 16-day mission, which ended with its breakup on re-entry on Feb. 1, the Atlantis was in the Vehicle Assembly Building near the launching pad at the Kennedy Space Center. Workers were mating the solid rocket boosters for the Atlantis's next mission to the external tank but had not attached the orbiter.</p>
        <p>By skipping preflight checks and accelerating various processes, NASA could have launched the Atlantis and reached the Columbia before the seven astronauts suffocated, said Adm. Harold W. Gehman Jr., chairman of the investigation board.</p>
        <p>''The launch of the second shuttle and the rescue was conceivable,'' Admiral Gehman, who is retired, said in a conference call with reporters. ''It isn't easy, it's not even highly likely. But it is conceivable.''</p>
        <p>In the days after the breakup, Ron D. Dittemore, the shuttle program manager, and other NASA officials said that little could have been done to repair the shuttle during the mission even if the extent of the damage had been known. But on Feb. 28, Sean O'Keefe, the NASA administrator, said the agency would have devoted all its resources to finding a way to save the crew.</p>
        <p>NASA's postcrash analysis has found that by minimizing the astronauts' activities, they could have survived for two weeks beyond the scheduled re-entry, until late on the night of Feb. 15. By then, a crew of four volunteer astronauts, including a veteran shuttle commander and veteran spacewalkers, could have reached the Columbia, carrying extra spacesuits and extra canisters of lithium hydroxide, the chemical used to absorb carbon dioxide in flight.</p>
        <p>But Admiral Gehman cautioned that the board had told NASA to base its analysis on two assumptions: that the damage to the Columbia's left wing would have been obvious during the flight, had NASA been looking for it; and that the agency would have been willing to launch the Atlantis knowing that it was at risk for the same sort of damage.</p>
        <p>Admiral Gehman compared the astronauts to a military pilot shot down behind enemy lines, and said that there was ''an unwritten contract'' to do everything possible to rescue them.</p>
        <p>''We would have erred on the side of taking the chance and gone after them,'' he said, adding that astronauts would have been ''standing out in the hallways'' to volunteer.</p>
        <p>At the board's request, NASA also evaluated whether the Columbia's crew members could have made repairs. The astronauts could have reached the likely site of the hole, on the leading edge of the wing, without further damage to the thermal protection system, the agency told the board, and could have stuffed heat-resistant objects into the hole.</p>
        <p>''No studies have been done on the thermal characteristics of this patch,'' Admiral Gehman said. ''Whether it would hold for 30 seconds or 90 seconds or three minutes, we have no clue.''</p>
        <p>NASA would have had to choose between rescue or repair, because sending astronauts out through the air lock would have quickly depleted the air supply, he said.</p>
        <p>A rendezvous in orbit would have been difficult because, unlike a shuttle and the space station, two shuttles are not designed to dock with each other. The Atlantis would have maneuvered so that its cargo bay faced the Columbia's, and astronauts would have traveled from one to the other.</p>
        <p>Earlier this week, a subgroup of the Gehman panel presented to the full board a list of 17 factors that might have contributed to the shuttle disaster by adding ''overall uncertainty'' to NASA's operating environment. The list appears in a slide presentation obtained by The New York Times.</p>
        <p>Many of the issues on that list have been widely discussed, even before the accident. But the fact that the board is planning to make the factors an important part of the final report indicates that members are looking to take the broadest possible view of the disaster.</p>
        <p>The list includes cuts in the shuttle program budget; ''pressures to reduce space shuttle operating costs to support new space transportation initiatives'' and pay for the International Space Station; ''reductions in NASA and contractor shuttle work force''; and ''lack of experience in the remaining work force due to retirements and loss of skilled personnel.''</p>
        <p>The list also discusses ''design compromises made to gain political support while still remaining within a fixed development budget,'' and the transition of major responsibility for shuttle operations from a large community of contractors ''working with detailed NASA oversight'' to a single shuttle contractor, United Space Alliance, with less direct oversight from NASA.</p>
        <p>The contract with United Space Alliance, which is owned by the Boeing Company and the Lockheed Martin Corporation, also contains ''potential tension between incentives for cost reduction, on-time launches, and safety assurance,'' according to the presentation.</p>
        <p>Other possible problems cited in the slides include ''managerial factors'' like ''conflicting signals about the future of the shuttle program coming from top NASA managers'' and ''turmoil within the shuttle program'' as program management was shifted from Washington to Houston and back to Washington. The list also includes lack of communication about safety ''within the shuttle program and between it and those higher up in NASA'' and ''declining influence'' of the safety offices.</p>
        <p>At a press briefing on Tuesday, John Logsdon, a member of the panel and the director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said the goal in addressing the larger issues was to look beyond the precise cause of the Columbia accident, and even beyond the specific problems with NASA culture that led the agency to play down problems with foam hitting the shuttle over time. Mr. Logsdon said this perspective would help ''to frame the broader public policy debate that follows upon our report.''</p>
