        <p>WHEN he was an 18-year-old freshman at Harvard University in 1980, Bill Haney noticed that a lot of dormitory rooms had fireplaces but no firewood. "So I borrowed $1,000 and shipped two tractor-trailer loads of firewood into Harvard Yard," he recalled.</p>
        <p>He worried about the gamble, but Mr. Haney's business instincts proved sound. The wood sold out, he made a $2,000 profit and his career as an entrepreneur was launched.</p>
        <p>He started looking for bigger opportunities. He was studying the history of science, which nurtured his belief in the importance, socially and economically, of technological change. Environmental technology looked promising, and he soon became intrigued by techniques for breaking down air pollutants, like the oxides of nitrogen, into harmless nitrogen and oxygen gases.</p>
        <p>Mr. Haney borrowed $10,000 from "a friend's girlfriend's father," he says, and with technology licensed mainly from a research organization, he founded the company in 1980 that eventually became Fuel Tech Inc. N.V.</p>
        <p>He sold out seven years later, pocketing $15 million, and then went on to found two other environmental companies, Energy Biosystems Corporation in 1989 and Molten Metal Technology Inc., also in 1989.</p>
        <p>Today, at age 32, William M. Haney 3d is one of America's leading environmental entrepreneurs, and he suffers no shortage of ambition. "I want to be the leading developer of technology to handle waste streams," Mr. Haney says.</p>
        <p>Molten Metal, which has pioneered a method for using molten metal to reduce hazardous wastes to useful industrial gases, is one of the hottest environmental start-ups in recent years. The fledgling company, which sold shares to the public last year, has a current stock-market value of about $450 million. Its technology has impressed several well-known big companies, including Du Pont, Rollins Environmental Services, and L'Air Liquide S.A., which have set up alliances with Molten Metal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Haney, by all accounts, is a skilled technology-spotter and deal maker. But the question now, analysts say, is whether he can really run a business, moving Molten Metal from concept to commercial success.</p>
        <p>The company has generated plenty of enthusiasm on Wall Street and among its corporate partners, and Mr. Haney is its principal salesman. The company, based in Waltham, Mass., has not yet made any money, although it has landed a half-dozen orders for its waste-processing systems, which will cost about $25 million apiece. Molten Metal hopes to begin installing its systems next year.</p>
        <p>But Douglas Augenthaler, an analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Company, observes, "It is not operating until it operates. The big pressure on Bill is whether he can finish on time, and have it work as advertised."</p>
        <p>Mr. Haney, the chairman and chief executive of Molten Metal, is confident. "We've hit all our milestones so far," he said. "Analysts are saying we will become profitable sometime in the next year to year-and-a-half, and we are comfortable with that."</p>
        <p>Intense and glib, Mr. Haney shows up for an interview at the company's demonstration factory here wearing a sports coat over a white T-shirt and blue jeans. During discussions, he often jumps up from a conference room table and walks rapidly to an easel where he sketches charts describing the availability of capital for new ventures or complex chemical processes. Colleagues say that Mr. Haney's restless energy leads him to occasionally conduct meetings on the move, lecturing as he walks the streets near the company's offices.</p>
        <p>The son of a chemistry teacher at Portsmouth Abbey, a preparatory school in Portsmouth, R.I., Mr. Haney says that as a teen-ager his first love was sports. But injuries prompted him to channel his energy elsewhere. "I broke one shoulder playing ice hockey and the other playing lacrosse," he recalled. "I could not play those sports anymore, so I focused on business."</p>
        <p>At Harvard, Mr. Haney's entrepreneurial career slowed the pace of his studies. "I took one semester off completely," he said, "It was just getting to be too much." . Mr. Haney started with the class of 1984 but did not complete his degree requirements until 1986.</p>
        <p>Some Harvard connections linger. Benjamin T. Downs, the vice president for finance and administration at Molten Metal, was one of Mr. Haney's college roommates.</p>
        <p>The year after he graduated, Mr. Haney sold most of Fuel Tech to Nalco Chemical Company, leaving with $15 million and a wealth of hard-earned experience. When he sold Fuel Tech, the Stamford, Conn.-based company had 200 employees and, Mr. Haney says, was near profitability but not yet in the black. "I started it when I was 18 years old, and I made so many mistakes," Mr. Haney said.</p>
        <p>FINANCIALLY secure and still just 25, Mr. Haney looked beyond business. He married Anne Gilson and then traveled, worked on Al Gore's presidential campaign and attempted to set up an environmental school in Zimbabwe. (The government did not grant him a permit.)</p>
        <p>Yet he still kept looking for promising environmental technologies. He found one in a method for using microorganisms to remove sulfur from coal and oil. Sulfur is an impurity in fossil fuels that is now removed from oil at vast refineries, which consume huge amounts of energy. The microbe desulfurization process was initially developed by the Institute of Gas Technology in Chicago, and it was the basis of Energy Biosystems.</p>
        <p>The company, headquartered near Houston, is in the process of building a pilot plant to see if microbe desulfurization can work outside the laboratory. If successful, Mr. Haney says, it could alter the way fuels are refined, eventually replacing energy-intensive oil refineries. Although he led Energy Biosystems in its early years, he left its board in March to concentrate on running Molten Metal.</p>
        <p>About the same time that Mr. Haney found the microbe desulfurization technology, John T. Preston, the head of the technology licensing office at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, introduced him to Christopher J. Nagle, an M.I.T. graduate student.</p>
        <p>Before he went to M.I.T., Mr. Nagle, who is now 36, worked as as an energy manager at the U.S. Steel Company. While there he had experimented with injecting old tires into vats of molten iron as a method for adding carbon, which is needed to convert iron to steel, and as a petroleum-based source of cheap energy.</p>
        <p>The experiment wasn't a clear-cut success in as a way to improve the efficiency of steel making. Still, the effort did show Mr. Nagle that molten metal, at 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit, can be quite efficient in breaking down complex molecules into their constituent atoms. So Mr. Nagle realized that the molten-metal process could be used to reduce complex, hazardous materials, like PCB's, into useful industrial gases such as hydrogen gas and carbon monoxide.</p>
        <p>At M.I.T., Mr. Nagle sought out Mr. Preston, the licensing expert, for help in commercializing the technology. Mr. Preston put him in touch with Mr. Haney. Together they founded Molten Metal in 1989. The company's process promises a big environmental, and economic, improvement over existing methods of getting rid of hazardous waste. Unlike burying the waste or burning it, Molten Metal intends to produce useful byproducts.</p>
        <p>The company's technology could also be useful in cleaning up the vast amounts of radioactive waste left over from the nation's nuclear weapons program. Joseph M. Browne, a vice president at Molten Metal and a retired captain in the United States Navy, says that when nuclear waste is fed into the brick-lined vats holding the molten metal, the radioactive elements concentrate in the slag that forms on the top of molten pool. When cooled, the slag becomes a glassy solid, immobilizing the radioactive elements for easier disposal.</p>
        <p>At Molten Metal, which now has 160 employees, Mr. Haney has tried to put together an organization that makes up for his own lack of experience in plant operations. Many of those working for him are considerably older. "Look behind Haney and you will see a lot of people with gray hair," said Mr. Augenthaler, the Oppenheimer analyst. "Its not all blue jeans and young guys."</p>
        <p>And it is mainly Mr. Haney who sells the company to prospective recruits as well as to Wall Street. "Bill Haney has a tremendous ability to enroll people in his vision," said Hugh Holman, an analyst at Alex. Brown &amp; Sons in Baltimore. "He gets people to believe. And that seems to be how he has managed to hire senior people who can get the job done."</p>
        <p>Mr. Haney said he wants a company staffed by skilled business people who are also believers in Molten Metal. "I would never hire a person motivated by money alone, because they will leave for money," he said. "We want people with a passion for what we are doing." William M. Haney 3d</p>
