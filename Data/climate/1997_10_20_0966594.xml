        <p>Four years ago, President Clinton stood in the Rose Garden and declared that by the end of the decade his Administration would reverse the increase in the nation's emissions of pollutants that threaten to warm the planet's climate.</p>
        <p>On Oct. 17, 1993, as he issued a 50-point plan, the President said, ''Today, I reaffirm my personal, and announce our nation's, commitment to reducing our emissions of greenhouse gases to their 1990 levels by the year 2000.'' To skeptics who called the plan too weak, he promised periodic reviews and modifications to keep the reduction of emissions on track.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's detailed promise, and how the nation is breaking it, will be at the heart of the Administration's problem this week in Bonn when representatives from around the world once again meet on the climate. They will be negotiating how quickly the industrial nations must rein in the emissions of carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases that build up in the atmosphere and trap the heat of the sun.</p>
        <p>The talks are supposed to end in December in Kyoto, Japan, with a new treaty on climate change to strengthen the one most of the world's nation's agreed to in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. And while the United States has called for a binding new treaty, it is also calling for what the White House calls realistic targets and timetables for reducing emissions that cause the greenhouse effect.</p>
        <p>At the current rate of growth, the  emission of greenhouse gases by the United States will be 13 percent above the level of 1990 by the end of the decade. The Administration has indicated that it will most likely postpone until the year 2010 or beyond the goal Mr. Clinton pledged to meet by 2000. Instead of accomplishing the goal in the year Mr. Clinton leaves office, the country would have to wait until well after his successor finished a second term.</p>
        <p>The reason, many critics say, is that the Administration refused to impose mandatory measures, like requiring the fuel efficiency of automobiles to be increased, or raising energy taxes to force people to conserve fuel. Greenhouse gases come mostly form burning fossil fuels, like coal and oil, and one of the best ways to reduce their emission is to save energy.</p>
        <p>''The only thing we know for absolute certain is that voluntary programs won't work,'' said Jessica Tuchman Matthews, an environmentalist who worked for Mr. Clinton at the State Department and is president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ''And that is progress. It was probably a stage that we had to go through.''</p>
        <p>Kathleen McGinty, the top environmental aide at the White House, cited three main reasons for the failure of the 50-point plan to achieve its goals: Congressional cuts in financing for energy conservation, the unexpectedly high rate of economic growth and fuel prices that were cheaper than anticipated.</p>
        <p>Other factors, too, helped to undermine the Administration's efforts. Congress temporarily blocked the Energy Department from issuing new energy efficiency standards for household appliances, and the department itself failed to issue new efficiency standards for electrical distribution transformers on power lines, where about 7 percent of all the nation's power simply leaks away.</p>
        <p>A proposal to label car tires so that consumers could tell which ones provided the best gasoline mileage went nowhere; the same fate awaited a tax proposal to discourage employers from subsidizing parking spaces for their employees. And forestry agencies missed the goals for planting trees, which absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as they grow.</p>
        <p>Only 70 percent of the projected reductions in greenhouse gases materialized, and even these reductions were offset when the booming economy brought a growing demand for fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Clinton issued his action plan four years ago, he projected that it would reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by about 109 million tons a year by 2000. That would be enough to return emissions to their 1990 level: 1.58 billion tons of carbon, an amount that had grown only slightly to 1.59 billion tons in 1992, the year before the plan was announced.</p>
        <p>Instead, the emissions in 1995 totaled 1.67 billion tons, and when the annual report for 1996 is issued later this month, it is virtually certain to show further growth. To be sure, the growth would have been even greater without the energy-saving plan.</p>
        <p>Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, called the reductions achieved ''nothing to sneeze at.''</p>
        <p>''It is a very big achievement, that voluntary programs were able to do that well,'' he said. ''The trouble is, the legs were cut out from under the voluntary program. Volunteerism works a lot better when it is matched up with mandatory measures. Jawboning is going to be less effective unless there is a cap on emissions.''</p>
        <p>A report by the State Department in July predicted that if the present levels of spending on energy conservation programs are continued under the plan, the emission of greenhouse gases would exceed 2 billion tons by the year 2010 and 2.2 billion tons by 2020.</p>
        <p>So the Administration wants to impose a new cap on future greenhouse gases. Under its plan, companies would be given permits to emit greenhouse gases, but at a reduced level. Companies that can inexpensively reduce their emissions below the cap would be allowed to sell their excess permits to companies that have a harder time cutting emissions. This approach, advocates say, would drive down the overall cost of compliance while guaranteeing that the nation's emissions' goals would be met.</p>
        <p>But the utility industry, which did more than any other sector to slow the growth of emissions under the voluntary plan, opposes stricter measures.</p>
        <p>''We just have a basic disagreement,'' said Robert A. Beck, vice president for environmental affairs of the Edison Electric Institute. which represents electric companies, ''We believe you have not maximized the voluntary programs yet.''</p>
        <p>Hundreds of utilities signed up for a voluntary program called the Climate Challenge, and the steps they have promised to take are estimated to have cut 45 million tons from emissions of greenhouse gases that otherwise would have occurred by 2000.</p>
        <p>But despite those reductions, the total emissions from the utility companies nationwide are going up, not down, and many of the reductions came from actions like switching to natural gas from coal, which might have occurred anyway.</p>
        <p>Of the reductions utilities say they achieved, 30 percent came from nuclear power plants, which do not emit any polluting gases, notably the opening by a Texas utility of a nuclear power plant that was ordered decades before global warming appeared on the nation's agenda. Only 7 percent of the reduction came from renewable energy projects, for example solar and wind.</p>
        <p>In the transportation sector, which accounts for about a third of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions, the action plan offered almost no proposals to reduce emissions in the short term, and none were forthcoming. A series of negotiations among industry, environmentalists and Government officials, aimed at achieving 2 percent annual increases in automotive fuel efficiency, broke down in disagreement.</p>
        <p>Instead, the Administration is banking on long-term research into new technologies, expecting that in the decades ahead automobiles can go two or three times as far on a gallon of gas -- or some other fuel.</p>
        <p>Opposition in Congress to spending on energy conservation and renewable energy appears to be waning. Based on actions in Congress so far, it appears that spending on these areas at the Energy Department next year will grow 10 percent, to about $924 million.</p>
        <p>Although that is still less than the $1.1 billion spent in 1995, the Sustainable Energy Coalition, a group of business, consumer, environmental and policy organizations, said the shift ''reflects growing Congressional awareness that energy efficiency and renewable-energy programs offer a cost-effective solution to environmental pollution -- including global climate change.''</p>
        <p>The Administration's voluntary programs have helped demonstrate that big companies can easily adopt more lighting that uses less electricity and otherwise conserve energy in commercial buildings.</p>
        <p>But some of the most effective actions taken under the Clinton Administration's plan were not voluntary. Rather, they involved old-fashioned command and control regulations.</p>
        <p>The Environmental Protection Agency, for example, sets rules under the Clean Air Act that require large landfills to capture and burn their emissions of methane, a gas that contributes to the greenhouse effect. When the agency issued the rules in 1996, it acted more strictly than planned, and the latest estimates are that the emission of greenhouse gases will be reduced by 8 million tons by the year 2000. That is 60 percent more reductions than the original plan predicted.</p>
