        <p>In a rare break with the White House on national security policy, the House of Representatives approved a measure today that substantially reduces an administration request for money to begin research on new nuclear weapons.</p>
        <p>The Republican-led House, in easily passing a $27.1 billion bill covering energy and water programs, pared more than $50 million sought by the White House to lay the groundwork for a new generation of nuclear weapons capable of penetrating underground bunkers. The vote on the overall bill was 377 to 26.</p>
        <p>No effort was made on the House floor to restore the money. ''There was no support,'' an aide to the House Appropriations Committee said.</p>
        <p>The action put the House at odds with the Senate, whose energy measure fully finances the administration's nuclear approach.</p>
        <p>The White House said in a statement that it ''strongly opposes'' the reductions in the nuclear spending.</p>
        <p>''Failure to invest in these initiatives will impede our ability to transform the nation's nuclear deterrent by denying policy makers the information they need to make decisions in an informed manner,'' the Office of Management and Budget said.</p>
        <p>The House Appropriations Committee surprised the White House by turning back its request for the research financing that the House and Senate agreed to earlier this year in separate measures authorizing military programs.</p>
        <p>At the behest of Representative David L. Hobson, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the panel that wrote the measure, the spending bill eliminated $6 million to study advanced nuclear weapons concepts like smaller ''mini-nukes'' with new tactical capabilities. It also cut out $25 million to speed the process for conducting underground nuclear tests. It trimmed $12 million from a $22 million proposal for environmental studies to choose a location to build the plutonium ''triggers'' for bombs. It reduced to $5 million from $15 million spending on research on converting existing nuclear weapons into earth-penetrating devices.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hobson said the government had to address the rising costs of managing its existing nuclear stockpile and disposing of its nuclear waste and should solve those problems before moving ahead with a new nuclear program.</p>
        <p>In the Senate, where support for the weapons initiative has been stronger, an appropriations panel has already approved all of the research money. Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who oversees the energy and water measure, has strong ties to the national nuclear laboratories where the research would be conducted, and he has indicated he will work to override the House cuts.</p>
        <p>But Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California and an opponent of the research, suggested this week that she would try to strip the money from the bill when it is considered on the floor. Ms. Feinstein and other Democrats and nuclear arms control advocates have said they believe the research program could spur another arms race by giving other nations incentives to try to match the new United States weapons capability.</p>
        <p>''When the United States seeks to develop new nuclear weapons,'' Ms. Feinstein said, ''it sends exactly the wrong signal to others about the utility of nuclear weapons and thus lowers the threshold for their use.''</p>
        <p>The Bush administration has said it has no intention of moving beyond the research phase. Indeed, further Congressional action would be required to begin development and construction of new nuclear devices if the research proceeded satisfactorily. But officials at both the Pentagon and Energy Department say current restrictions on research are chilling scientific advances on nuclear weapons. They also say the nation needs to examine the effectiveness of its cold war arsenal of intercontinental nuclear missiles in an era when threats are less likely to come from superpowers than from terrorists and smaller countries.</p>
        <p>The energy measure provided $765 million next year for nuclear waste disposal, $174 million above the administration's request. An effort was defeated that would have shifted $30 million from a plan to open a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada to a renewable energy program; the vote was 251 to 153.</p>
        <p>The administration raised further concern about the measure because it failed to grant the full amount sought to develop a hydrogen-fueled car.</p>
        <p>Late Thursday, the House also adopted a $19.6 billion measure paying for Interior Department programs next year after the Republican majority defeated efforts to alter the bill's approach to federal land and wildlife policy. An effort to ban snowmobiles in Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks failed on a tie 210 to 210 vote.</p>
