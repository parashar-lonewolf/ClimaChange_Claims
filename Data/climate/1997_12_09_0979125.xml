        <p>For Gore, Climate Meeting Is a Delicate Balancing Act  Vice President Al Gore, in Kyoto, Japan, for an international meeting on global warming, found himself navigating between competing constituencies of business groups and environmentalists, all of whom he may need in his quest for the Democratic nomination in 2000.</p>

        <p>Clinton Meets China Dissident  Wei Jingsheng, the prominent dissident recently released from a Chinese prison, met with President Clinton in the White House and urged him to continue pressing Beijing to improve its record on human rights and democracy. Mr. Clinton, who had requested the meeting, declined to comment on his conversation with Mr. Wei, who had spent almost 18 years in prison for writing an essay advocating democracy.</p>

        <p>Vitriol Flies Around China Book  Doubts about the authenticity of ''The City of Light,'' a book said to be a translation of one written in the 13th century and relating the experiences of an Italian Jewish merchant in China, have blossomed into growing invective. The writer, a Briton who lives in Italy, insists he translated the book from a manuscript he was allowed to read only on condition that he not show the original or reveal the owner's identity.</p>

        <p>Case for a Global Prosecutor  Louise Arbour of Canada, the chief prosecutor for the United Nations war crimes tribunals for the Balkans and Rwanda, argued that a powerful, independent prosecutor would be crucial to the success of a permanent international criminal court. The United States fears that such a system could lead to criminal proceedings being pursued against American soldiers abroad.</p>

        <p>Swiss Sanctions May Be Eased  State and local government officials in New York and California called for temporarily easing sanctions they have imposed on Swiss banks in an effort to get the banks to turn over assets to the heirs of Holocaust victims. They also recommended a moratorium on new sanctions until at least April 1. Holocaust survivors were critical.</p>

        <p>New Welfare Tactics in Britain  Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain announced the creation of an advisory unit that will try to focus Government efforts on the poorest members of society. The move was an effort to convince doubters that pushing for spending restraints and tougher welfare standards will not mean that the disadvantaged will be ignored.</p>

        <p>Islamic Leaders Meet in Iran  Leaders representing the world's Muslims went to Iran for a conference that Iran contends is evidence that it has overcome American efforts to isolate it. The gathering, the largest in Iran since the 1979 revolution that overthrew an American ally, Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi, is expected to condemn Israel for ''reinstating an atmosphere of war'' in the Middle East.</p>

        <p>With Heroism Questioned, Remains to Be Exhumed  The widow of M. Larry Lawrence decided to have his remains exhumed from Arlington National Cemetery in the face of mounting evidence that the former ambassador to Switzerland had fabricated a heroic World War II record. In a letter to President Clinton, the widow said she had decided to bring her husband's remains ''home to San Diego for interment near friends and family who love him.'' Just hours before her letter was received at the White House, Wilbur Wright College in Chicago confirmed that Mr. Lawrence was enrolled as a full-time student there in March 1945. That was when Mr. Lawrence said he was serving in the United States merchant marine.</p>

        <p>Reno and Freeh Defy Panel  Attorney General Janet Reno and the F.B.I. Director Louis J. Freeh defied a House committee, refusing in an unusual joint letter to comply with a subpoena to turn over a memorandum written by Mr. Freeh two weeks ago that had urged her to allow an independent prosecutor to investigate campaign fund-raising. The internal memorandum reportedly contains confidential grand jury testimony about a pending inquiry.</p>

        <p>Nominee Still Has a Chance  Clinton Administration officials said that if Senate Republicans continued to block the nomination of Bill Lann Lee to head the Justice Department's civil rights division, the President would appoint him while the Senate is in recess.</p>

        <p>G.O.P. Losing Hispanic Support  The California Republican Party is losing ground among the fastest growing group in the electorate of the nation's biggest state, Hispanic voters. By 2000, Hispanic residents are expected to comprise nearly 30 percent of the voting-age population. Republicans have been burned by a backlash against Gov. Pete Wilson's strong stands against illegal immigration and affirmative action. The national implications for the party are also sobering, both because of California's electoral importance and because of growing Hispanic populations across the nation.</p>

        <p>A Debate on Mental Illness  If they present a psychiatric defense for the man accused of being the Unabomber, Theodore J. Kaczynski, his lawyers may reopen a debate over when to hold people who claim mental illness criminally responsible, some experts say. Some of the authorities say the case is already providing ammunition for people on both sides of the debate about the place of mental-illness testimony in court.</p>

        <p>Hot Line for Homeless  Expecting a colder winter than usual, the Department of Housing and Urban Development announced the creation of a toll-free telephone number to summon aid for homeless people who do not have food and shelter.  Department officials said the number would also be used to encourage more Americans to help solve problems that lead to the deaths of homeless people because of exposure. ''This is literally a matter of life and death,'' said Andrew M. Cuomo, the Housing Secretary.</p>

        <p>Governor Announces New Transit Fare Plan</p>
        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki announced a program of monthly, weekly and daily passes that will give mass transit users unlimited trips for a fixed price, in a dramatic move intended to transform the travel habits of New York City's subway and bus riders, The passes, which will cost $63 for a month, $17 for a week or $4 for a day, are priced to give the biggest breaks to people who use the system for more than just a five-day-a-week commute: workers who hold two jobs, parents who take their children to school and then go to work, people who go out at night.</p>

        <p>Board Gives Version of Crash  The National Transportation Safety Board showed video animations of  the last moments of Trans World Airlines Flight 800 and painted a picture with significantly different details from the one laid out by the C.I.A. two weeks ago. The safety board also offered more detail on why the board does not believe a missile or bomb was involved in the crash off the coast of Long Island last year, in which all 230 people on board died.</p>

        <p>Wall Still a Hazard  Part of Madison Avenue remained cordoned off as city workers carefully continued efforts to repair an office building wall that had peeled off on Sunday, rained debris and spilled a ton of bricks into a torn safety net.  Gaston Silva, the city's Commissioner of Buildings, said the wall was still unstable and would require an all-night effort to insert a steel support beam in its side.</p>

        <p>Criticism of Oxford Grows  A growing number of regulators, investors, doctors and consultants are beginning to conclude that Oxford Health Plans Inc. was too quick to blame its computer system for delays in paying doctors and hospitals hundreds of millions of dollars. Critics say that Oxford has more serious problems: a poor grasp of how much it costs to deliver the care it promises and poor crisis management.</p>
