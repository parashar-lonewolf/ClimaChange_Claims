        <p>IF Detroit and California ever made a sitcom together, it would be sort of like ''Dharma and Greg.''</p>
        <p>Detroit, the strait-laced company town, just can't figure out that wacky California. Is it the nation's biggest car market, or is it the most troublesome? Is it the land of Ronald Reagan and Lee Iacocca, or of tree hugging hippies who want every car to be electric?</p>
        <p>Yes, Arnold Schwarzenegger lives there, and he drove a Hummer before anybody else. But another resident is Gray Davis, the Democratic governor of California, who signed a controversial bill on Monday to cut greenhouse gas emissions. That, needless to say, could mean fewer Hummers.</p>
        <p>''There's more than a little concern among the car companies about how bad the relationship with California has gotten,'' one industry executive said, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>''There needs to be a stand-down, but the more we want to talk, the more radical and out of control they get,'' he added. ''You'd almost like to see a white knight come in here and arbitrate.''</p>
        <p>The state's new legislation, which will almost certainly be challenged in court, would sharply cut emissions of carbon dioxide, mostly by imposing new, yet-to-be-determined regulations on cars and trucks sold in the state by the 2008 model year. It is only the latest challenge the industry faces from California, which has regularly been aggressive in setting air-quality standards. The state has set tougher rules on emissions of smog-forming pollutants than the federal government.</p>
        <p>The industry's view of California was summed up last week in an editorial cartoon in The Detroit News. A middle-aged couple stand in their driveway, next to their sedan. They are looking quizzically at their neighbor, Mr. Jones, who is riding a galloping horse out of his garage, briefcase in hand.</p>
        <p>The Joneses, the cartoon's caption read, ''say their new, state-of-the-art low-emission vehicle meets California's C02  emissions rules.''</p>
        <p>By signing the bill, Mr. Davis put his state squarely at odds with Washington. The Bush administration has pulled the United States out of the Kyoto Protocol, a global agreement on regulating greenhouse-gas emissions. And in March, the Senate handily defeated a bill that would have significantly raised gasoline mileage requirements for the first time since the 1980's. Tailpipe emissions from cars driven in the United States constitute the world's fifth-leading source of greenhouse gas, according to the Sierra Club. The nation as a whole is the top producer of such emissions.</p>
        <p>REPEATED defeats on Capitol Hill have made California an appealing alternative battleground for frustrated environmental groups and politicians. Senators John McCain and John F. Kerry, who led a failed Senate effort to raise fuel standards, sent a joint letter to California legislators encouraging them to consider the bill. ''Big money and the special interests went to the mat to stop us,'' Mr. Kerry said earlier this month. ''I'm just glad to see they weren't able to smother a real dialogue in California.''</p>
        <p>Republican leaders, and influential Midwestern Democrats like Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, have long prevailed in their opposition to toughening federal gasoline mileage requirements. The industry's expected legal challenge to the new California legislation will likely argue that the state's authority to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions from automobiles is superseded by the federal government's fuel economy regulations, because the two issues are closely correlated.</p>
        <p>''We will see if CO2  is something different from fuel economy,'' Dieter Zetsche, chief executive of the Chrysler Group, said last Thursday.</p>
        <p>''We are clearly aware of our responsibility and that of the industry to increase fuel economy,'' he added. ''We don't think it's the best approach to force the customer into a mix of vehicles that they wouldn't buy on their own.''</p>
        <p>Companies like Chrysler have argued that California's regulations are already forcing them to produce small cars that consumers don't want and to develop costly and in some cases obsolete technologies. The most immediate threat is California's zero-emission vehicle mandate, which would force the industry to derive 10 percent of its sales from low-  and zero-emission vehicles, like battery powered cars. The plan has been delayed by a legal challenge from General Motors and DaimlerChrysler.</p>
        <p>Environmental groups counter that California's regulations have been the only real impetus to developing cleaner technologies like hybrid engines that use electricity and gasoline, or hydrogen fuel cells, a technology many automakers see as one day replacing the internal combustion engine.</p>
        <p>Detroit, for its part, says it is giving customers what they want. All one has to do is look at the sales figures. Last year, for the first time, sales of passenger cars were overtaken by less fuel-efficient pickup trucks, S.U.V.'s and minivans.</p>
        <p>While G.M. phases out Oldsmobile, the Hummer brand, based on the Humvee military transport, is rising in its place. This month, G.M. began selling the Hummer H2, a smaller vehicle that can fit in some garages. Still, at 8,600 pounds, it is so big it is not subject to the same fuel-economy rules that govern other cars. G.M. estimates the H2 gets about 13 miles per gallon, which would put one H2's carbon emissions at 3.4 metric tons in a typical year, compared to 1.9 tons from G.M.'s Chevrolet Malibu sedan.</p>
        <p>A recent magazine advertisement showed the imposing grill of the Hummer looming over an arid, treeless landscape under a pale sun.</p>
        <p>''Hummer,'' the ads copy reads. ''Like nothing else.''</p>
