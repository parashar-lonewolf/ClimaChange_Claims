        <p>GEORGE WESTPHAL'S sky-blue 1985 Nissan Sentra has braved two decades of harsh winters in Pearl River, N.Y. -- and looks it. Spots of rust litter the hood. Door hinges creak. A thick stripe of duct tape holds a cracked dashboard together.</p>
        <p>But inside, this unassuming old car holds some hidden surprises. Behind the fuel door, where a thirsty black hole used to be, is a three-pronged plug. Pop the trunk, and eight lead-acid batteries reveal themselves, aligned neatly in two rows. Where the engine used to be are two more batteries, along with a platform of wires and electronic casings. Sit behind the wheel to find an amp meter and a battery indicator in place of fuel and oil-pressure gauges. Mr. Westphal's ex-gasoline drinker has taken on a new identity. It's a purely electric car -- and he did the conversion himself.</p>
        <p>With gasoline prices soaring -- in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, they went well above $4 in some states this week -- drivers are taking a new interest in electric cars. Many have already turned to hybrid gasoline-and-electric models like the popular Toyota Prius, though the wait can be overwhelming. In the discussion forum hybridcars.com, most hybrid buyers said they had waited several weeks for their cars -- 64 weeks in one case.</p>
        <p>But anyone interested in buying an all-electric car from a major carmaker is essentially out of luck.</p>
        <p>Manufacturers have canceled work on vehicles like the Toyota RAV4-EV, the General Motors EV-1 and the Honda EV+. (According to Toyota's Web site, it discontinued its vehicle because of a lack of demand and technical problems. For now, converting a gasoline-powered car is the best -- and for most, the only -- way to get an all-electric car.</p>
        <p>Any car can be converted, from a Hummer to a Geo Metro, and parts are available from several suppliers. Most components can go in most cars, and only about a dozen or so main parts -- including an electric motor and an adapter to connect it to the transmission -- are necessary for the conversion.</p>
        <p>The needed parts are available from several suppliers and are sometimes even sold as a kit -- typically for $5,000 to $15,000. (Optional parts provide for power brakes and steering, air-conditioning and heat.) You could hire a mechanic or pay a specialty company to convert a gas-burning car to electric. Or you could buy one of the kits and dive in to do it yourself.</p>
        <p>''Converting a car is the sort of thing that any determined individual could do,'' said Ken Wells, a physics teacher at St. Mark's, a boarding school in Southborough, Mass.</p>
        <p>''The mechanics aren't that complicated because there aren't that many parts,'' agreed Carole Lemos-Wade, a senior who helped convert a bright yellow 1994 Ford Ranger pickup in a class project Mr. Wells ran for several years. ''There's little maintenance,'' she added, ''and there's an insane amount of pollution eliminated.''</p>
        <p>Of course, it does help to be someone who likes to tinker and to have a good basic knowledge of cars. Mr. Westphal, for instance, is a retired engineer who was still working full time when he converted his Nissan in his spare time. ''I just thought it would be a fun project,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He had been looking to convert a car to electric when the engine died on his wife's Sentra in 1998. The vehicle, which was bought new in 1985, gave him ready raw material.</p>
        <p>In a search online, Mr. Westphal found his parts supplier, Electric Vehicles of America in Wolfeboro, N.H. Over a couple of years, he bought about $5,000 in spare parts and did the work gradually -- eventually achieving a conversion so complete that he even scribbled over the warning, ''Unleaded fuel only'' from the area on the dashboard where the fuel gauge used to be.</p>
        <p>The biggest surprise for an interested guest invited to take a spin in Mr. Westphal's car came with the turning of the key. There was no gunning, no revving -- just the strange sound of silence. (Even after years of driving the car, Mr. Westphal has to double check to make sure the car is turned on before backing out of the driveway.) There was no exhaust, no danger of flooding the engine -- it was easy to see how a driver can be captivated by the experience.</p>
        <p>Since the 1960's, a small but devoted community of electric enthusiasts has sold conversion components, worked to increase the public's awareness of electric cars and organized clubs and events. Ron Freund, chairman of the Electric Auto Association, which has more than 30 chapters in North America, estimates that today there are around 8,500 converted vehicles in the United States, about half in California.</p>
        <p>Most of the enthusiasts see the cars as nonpolluting, though skeptics point out that the electricity used to charge the batteries may come from the burning of fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>For Electro Automotive, based in Felton, Calif., which has been supplying conversion parts since 1979, Volkswagen Rabbits and Porsche 914's are the most popular models for conversion.</p>
        <p>According to Shari Prange, who owns the company with her husband, Mike Brown, the Rabbit's boxy shape lends itself to placing rectangular batteries inside. And the Porsche? ''It just has a cult following,'' said Ms. Prange, ''and the fairly lightweight chassis is good for supporting an electric motor and a bunch of batteries.''</p>
        <p>E.V.A., Mr. Westphal's supplier, most often has requests for components for Chevy S-10 pickups. ''You can put the batteries under the bed and still use the bed,'' said Bob Batson, the company's president.</p>
        <p>BEFORE those components can go in, though, some things have to come out: the engine, fuel tank, exhaust system, radiator and cooling systems. They're replaced with a motor, an adapter to mount the motor to the transmission, a speed controller to translate accelerator pressure to power, a charger and a converter to power the lights and horn.</p>
        <p>Then, of course, there are the batteries. Most people use 6-volt, 8-volt or 12-volt lead-acid batteries. Nickel metal hydride batteries are more powerful and efficient, but these systems can run as high as $30,000. Mr. Westphal bought ten 12-volt lead-acid batteries for around $85 each.</p>
        <p>A little ingenuity helped the project along. Mr. Westphal did some machine work to fashion his own motor-to-transmission adapter plate. He built an ironing board-shape platform out of plywood for all the electronics. And he molded the battery casings out of PVC.</p>
        <p>In Southborough, Ms. Lemos-Wade and Mr. Wells's other students followed more standard methods in converting the pickup truck. When they were finished, they entered it in the Tour de Sol, a competition for vehicles that approach zero emissions and use renewable fuels. It's not a race; cars are judged on technical attributes.</p>
        <p>There are also other competitions. For the last 10 years, high school teams have entered an electric vehicle conversion competition in North Carolina called the EV Challenge. The two dozen or so converted cars involved each year are judged on factors like speed and range. The 2005 winner in the range category lasted 137 miles on a single charge -- pretty good, considering that the typical electric conversion vehicle, depending on size, weight and efficiency, gets around 30 to 60 miles per charge.</p>
        <p>That limited range is an electric car's biggest drawback, keeping it squarely in the realm of neighborhood vehicle. For some people, that's sufficient. For years, Mr. Westphal used his Sentra to commute to work. Getting back, however, was dependent on his employer's agreeing to install a dedicated outlet for him.</p>
        <p>Another drawback: electric cars don't always work well in cold weather. Mr. Westphal's Sentra becomes less efficient when the temperature dips below 40 degrees; more than once it just stopped running, and his wife had to rescue him.</p>
        <p>But for conversion enthusiasts, these are mild inconveniences. They like not having to worry about oil changes, engine problems or the rising price of gasoline. All Mr. Westphal does for maintenance is occasionally refill the batteries with water and make sure the cables are connected.</p>
        <p>The batteries are the only real expense; they must be replaced every 1,000 or so charges (for Mr. Westphal, around 30,000 miles). And the conversion system will last; it's just the body's falling apart that dictates when this car dies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Westphal said that charging his car costs only around 75 cents (though it takes around six hours) and one charge propels him about 30 miles. The same distance on a gallon of gasoline costs perhaps three times that figure. While other conversion owners get different ranges, they cite the same statistic: basically, just a few pennies a mile.</p>
        <p>Of course, for many car enthusiasts, the bottom line is performance. On a gorgeous summer day, as Mr. Westphal tooled around the tree-lined streets near his home, his Sentra exhibited all the gusto of a gasoline-powered car, yet with the quiet hum of a golf cart. Highway driving? ''No problem,'' he said, as he took the Interstate ramp and inched the speedometer up to 65 m.p.h.</p>
        <p>The only quirk, he said, was that because his car is an automatic transmission, he has to press the accelerator just a bit at a dead stop, building up pressure in the transmission for half a second before engaging the motor. ''Hear that?'' he asked as he lightly tapped the pedal and a slight whining noise indicated that the transmission was primed.</p>
        <p>''Now we're ready to go,'' he said, as the light he was stopped at turned green. ''Now we can drag race.''</p>
