        <p>With oil prices hovering near $30 a barrel, advocates of wood energy are calling on the Government to forge a national energy policy that would make wood once again an economically attractive fuel for generating electricity.</p>
        <p>Improved technologies and environmental benefits should rekindle interest in wood and other vegetable fuels called biomass, advocates say. In Vermont, which has gone from 20 percent forest to 80 percent in the last century. some developers are taking a serious look at new wood-burning projects.</p>
        <p>Environmentally, wood is attractive for several reasons. It has no sulfur, so burning it does not contribute to acid rain, said Robert Kennel, a vice president of Hadson Power Systems, who is in charge of developing wood and coal plants for the Southern California-based company.</p>
        <p>Barry Commoner, a leading environmental expert, said that theoretically wood even could be preferable to fossil fuels. "Coal, oil or natural gas would contribute to the global warming effect," he said, "A tree would not," because it would be releasing carbon dioxide that was taken out of the atmosphere when it grew, whereas the other fuels represent much older carbon.</p>
        <p>Professor Commoner, who is director of the Center for the Biology of Natural Systems at Queens College of the City University of New York, also said that emissions from wood-fueled power plants, like those from any other power plants, could be controlled through the use of electrostatic preciitators or scrubbers.</p>
        <p>"The only way I know that the environmental issue has arisen from wood-burning," he said, was when people in Vermont and New Hampshire used wood-burning stoves and furnaces. Unlike a power plant, they do not have emission controls, so smoke accumulates.</p>
        <p>Another advantage to the plants being tried in Vermont and California is that they use only waste wood from industry and agriculture, solving a waste-disposal problem, not cutting down trees to burn. Despite the environmenal advantages, the economic advantages are less clear-cut.</p>
        <p>"Rising oil prices should have a positive effect on getting people and institutions thinking about alternative energy," Mr. Kennel said.</p>
        <p>"The concern is that no one knows how long oil prices will stay high," he said. "The only thing that's going to get wood energy back into the picture is a solidly thought-out national energy policy, something we've never had in this country."</p>
        <p>Wood burning, once promising, had a boom period in the 1980's, only to slow to a near-standstill by the end of the decade after the 1986 tax law curbed tax credits for alternative energy, along with many other tax breaks.</p>
        <p>The most promising technologies would both reduce capital costs and increase the efficiency of biomass plants, said David Rinebolt, director of research for the National Wood Energy Association, a trade association of developers of wood projects.</p>
        <p>Whole-tree burning allows trees to be burned in 20-foot sections, eliminating the need for processing the wood into chips and thereby cutting costs.</p>
        <p>A technology called gasification involves "cooking," or heating, the wood in an oxygen-restricted environment and separating it into volatile gases, charcoal and tars. The gases can be fed directly into the turbines that generate electricity, eliminating the need for steam power.</p>
        <p>Vermont has proposed using the gasification process with a highly efficient gas turbine engine, developed by General Electric for use in jets.</p>
        <p>The Vermont Department of Public Service has won a commitment from the Federal Government of close to $1 million to pay for a feasibility study for a 20-megawatt wood-gasification power plant in Bennington, near the New York State line.</p>
        <p>"Southwestern Vermont has the most underutilized forest, so the forestry people like it," said George Sterzinger, commissioner of the department. "We like it because it is one of the cleanest ways to generate electricity without a net addition of carbon dioxide to the environment."</p>
        <p>In addition, the state signed an agreement with Brazil last May to explore the applications of the gasification technology for agricultural waste, specifically sugar cane.</p>
        <p>"This project would have both local economic and global environmental benefits," Mr. Sterzinger said. "It potentially leverages a small amount of Federal money to attract a large amount of private money. Everybody's just been waiting to see if somebody else could make it work."</p>
        <p>But others remain unconvinced that technology alone will bring wood back into play. Mr. Kennel argues that only national policy can do that.</p>
        <p>Vermont was a pioneer in using wood as a fuel to generate electricity for commercial sale. The McNeil Generating Station, owned by the Burlington Electric Department, went into commercial operation in 1984. It used wood, taken from nearby forests, that was chipped for burning.</p>
        <p>At 50 megawatts, it is the largest wood-fired plant in the country, capable of serving 100,000 to 150,000 people. There was trouble from the start, however, leading some detractors to write it off as a failure. But to backers of wood burning, McNeil became an object lesson for future plants.</p>
        <p>The McNeil station, conceived in the years after the oil embargo when oil prices were high and Congress was enthusiastic about renewable energy sources, was built in a populated area.</p>
        <p>Wood was plentiful, but there was poor road access. And by the time the plant, which was expensive to run, started up, oil prices had dropped. Also, it was noisy and dirty, angering its neighbors just outside the city.</p>
        <p>"I have to say the Burlington Electric Department showed some pizazz in attempting McNeil," said Mr. Kennel, whose company, Hadson Power Systems, has developed eight wood-burning plants. "It is certainly the granddaddy of wood plants. What we all learned from it is that 50 megawatts is too big. We also learned that a location with good road access is critical."</p>
        <p>Despite McNeil's problems, national interest in wood burning, spurred by Federal tax policy, grew quickly. In 1986 alone, 1,839 megawatts of electricity from wood-burning generators went into operation, more than half the 3,054 megawatts of power introduced from 1980 to 1985.</p>
        <p>Over all, Mr. Kennel estimated, there are 1,000 wood-fired plants in the country, typically ranging from 10 to 25 megawatts. A 20-megawatt plant burns 600 tons of wood a day and can serve 50,000 people, but only a third of the plants offer electricity for sale. The rest are owned and operated by the forest-products industry for its own use.</p>
        <p>Wood energy has been tried principally in New England and California, where it has been seen as an alternative to failed nuclear plants.</p>
        <p>But in 1989 Mr. Rinebolt of the wood energy association said that without the tax credits only 614 megawatts of wood-fueled electricity were brought into operation. This year, he expects the number to be even smaller: 250 to 300 megawatts; plants are under development in Vermont, Connecticut, Maine and Michigan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rinebolt said, "Coal projects are getting bid in at 3.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, while wood is at 5 cents."</p>
