        <p>LEAD: Slumped in the subway seat is a young man with vacant eyes, a fatigue jacket, and a copy of ''Catcher in the Rye,'' the familiar red cover curled in his hand. Maybe his mind is the psychological equivalent of a Salvador Dali painting. Maybe he's just a college student facing a long day's journey into a Modern American Lit exam.</p>
        <p>Slumped in the subway seat is a young man with vacant eyes, a fatigue jacket, and a copy of ''Catcher in the Rye,'' the familiar red cover curled in his hand. Maybe his mind is the psychological equivalent of a Salvador Dali painting. Maybe he's just a college student facing a long day's journey into a Modern American Lit exam. The book makes me think first one thing, then the other.</p>
        <p>The book makes me think. It's a dangerous book. It was Mark David Chapman's Bible in the weeks before he murdered John Lennon. And it gets yanked out of American schools more than almost any other title. Its perfect-pitch rendering of adolescence has spoken to millions of people and even obsessed a few. It is a true thing. ''The truth shall make you free,'' wrote the Apostle John.</p>
        <p>But the truth shall make you think, too, and it shall make you wonder, and it shall make you doubt, because that's how you get to it in the first place. And the people who believe every question has one answer hate that stuff. So they dump ''Catcher'' off curriculums every chance they get. Usually they talk about its profanity; they do not recognize its integrity.</p>
        <p>This same thing has happened to the photographs of the late Robert Mapplethorpe in Cincinnati. The arts center where they are being shown and the center's director have been indicted on obscenity charges. Some of the photographs are about sex. This is upsetting to many people. And some are about sex between men. This makes people crazy. If you don't believe me, look at the letters Newsweek got a few weeks ago after running a cover story on gay people. You could take the paint off cars with some of those letters.</p>
        <p>But the real problem is that the pictures are dangerous. The Mapplethorpe pictures make you think about sexuality, and that's threatening as hell. They may make you confront things you never wanted to confront your whole life long.</p>
        <p>So that's fine. Don't go. Take the kids to the zoo. Watch ''America's Funniest Home Videos.'' Dismiss the Mapplethorpe show as dirty pictures. Think of it in the way people thought of ''The Scarlet Letter'' in the 1850's, or Gaugin's bare-breasted brown-skinned women at the turn of the century, or ''Ulysses'' or ''The Last Temptation of Christ.''</p>
        <p>Think of it as bad stuff you don't like, but don't think of it as bad stuff I can't like. I don't like anchovies and modern architecture and Stephen King, and that's the way I live: old house, no salty fish, no ''The Shining.'' No reason you should live that way, too.</p>
        <p>No reason why I shouldn't be able to see the Mapplethorpe show while you stay home except that we have these obscenity laws that invoke community standards. Community standards confuse me. All over America we have communities where parents send their children off with popcorn money to watch Freddy Krueger carve teen-agers up with razor fingers, and then are unnerved by Holden Caulfield's ''goddamns.'' We have communities where violence against women is commonplace but love between men is considered a crime against nature.</p>
        <p>Those are not my standards. The only crimes against nature I can come up with are TV evangelism and running for political office. I hate censorship, too. There is one message in censorship: You are not to be trusted.</p>
        <p>From the Apostle John to John Donne: ''No man is an island.'' Well, maybe he should be. Maybe America should try a bit of that rugged individualism stuff again. The board of standards resides within our own skulls.</p>
        <p>You don't like Federal funding for this stuff? That's O.K.; the Stealth bomber offends my esthetic sensibilities. You say potato and I'll say pohtato. No one needs to censor my television by threatening sponsors; I'll turn the dial myself. I'll listen to records and decide which ones belong in my house, so leave the warning labels off. My kids can read - no must read ''Catcher in the Rye,'' because it's a great book, and a true one. This is my community. Those are my standards.</p>
        <p>And you can buy anchovies and do whatever you want in your house, too.</p>
        <p>Today is Earth Day. People are concerned with the American landscape. PCB's sludging around the Hudson. Dolphins drowning in tuna nets. Acid rain sunsets over landfill mountains. It's getting dirtier and dirtier. But I keep thinking about the American mind, a mind that veers away from danger into that placid land of multiple-choice questions in which there is only one right answer, in which there is one community standard for us all, in which we are afraid of our own judgment. It seems to be getting tinier, and tinier, and tinier. That's obscene.</p>
