        <p>The Senate unanimously urged the Clinton Administration today not to pursue a treaty that would limit the industrial world's emissions of greenhouse gases unless the agreement requires developing countries to control their rapidly growing emissions at the same time.</p>
        <p>While it is not binding, the Senate resolution complicates the continuing negotiations for a new treaty to prevent global warming caused by increasing levels of carbon dioxide as people burn more fossil fuel.</p>
        <p>The Senate would have to consent by a two-thirds vote to the ratification of any such treaty by the United States. The resolution criticizing the Administration's current negotiating approach passed, 95 to 0.</p>
        <p>In the debate, many senators expressed skepticism that global warming was a serious problem or that the United States, as the leading emitter of gases like carbon dioxide that trap heat from the sun, should do more than poorer nations to reverse it.</p>
        <p>But even those senators who favor a treaty voted for the resolution after its chief sponsor, Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, expressly endorsed the scientific consensus behind the global warming theory and signaled that less developed countries ought to be granted more flexibility in cutting emissions, as long as they accept the treaty commitments.</p>
        <p>The final negotiations for the treaty are to be made at a meeting in Kyoto, Japan, at the end of the year.The next round of bargaining is to begin next week in Bonn. The resolution that passed the Senate today disputes a basic premise of those talks: that the first and biggest steps ought to be taken by industrial nations like the United States.</p>
        <p>Senator Byrd, a Democrat, said the proposal offered by the Administration in the talks was ''simply unacceptable.'' That proposal would set binding limits on emissions of heat-trapping gases by industrial nations in the medium term, while deferring the time when developing nations would have to accept similar limits.</p>
        <p>Mr. Byrd's resolution is supported by energy producing and consuming industries, especially the coal industry, which sustains the West Virginia economy and is powerful in many other states. Industry lobbyists have argued that reducing such gases threatens their prosperity.</p>
        <p>Andrew Card, president of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, called the vote ''a wake-up call to the Administration to adopt a more open and realistic approach to global climate negotiations.''</p>
        <p>But Tim Wirth, the Under Secretary of State for global environmental affairs, tried to put the best light on the situation, saying after the vote that ''we support the thrust of the Byrd resolution,'' and added: ''We have been further out front than any country in pressing for developing-country commitments. The U.S. is much more aggressive than anyone else, and this strengthens our hand.''</p>
        <p>Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts, a Democrat, and John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, a Republican, joined with Mr. Byrd in a carefully scripted colloquy on the floor during which they all seemed to agree that each country should make, as Senator Byrd put it, ''unique and binding contributions of a pace and kind consistent with their industrialization.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Byrd added, ''The developing world must agree in Kyoto to adopt some manner of binding targets and commitments which would begin during the same compliance period as the developed world, in as aggressive and effective a schedule as possible.''</p>
        <p>A scripted discussion in a Senate debate is important because it provides a legislative history intended to clarify the intention of a resolution.</p>
        <p>Mr. Byrd also said his resolution ''accepts the thesis, which is still the subject of some dispute,'' that global warming is a real problem.</p>
        <p>Many scientists believe the warming of the planet could cause ocean levels to rise and would severely disrupt the earth's biological systems. Such a trend is likely, they say, because increasing levels of carbon dioxide and other gases trap heat from the sun in a process similar to what happens in a greenhouse.</p>
        <p>In the colloquy, Mr. Kerry built support for the Administration's plan to allow developing and developed nations to trade credits with one another for reducing emissions, a plan intended to reduce the costs faced by industrial nations while decreasing the pollution generated by developing nations.</p>
        <p>But the debate also highlighted strong feelings among some lawmakers against any treaty whatsoever. Senator Larry E. Craig, Republican of Idaho, accused President Clinton of using his ''bully pulpit to terrorize the American people,'' and of ''building a propaganda campaign'' to support a new treaty.</p>
