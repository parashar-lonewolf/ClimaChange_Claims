        <p>rays of hope on energy**Editorial notes Senate opponents successfully blocked final vote on 'dreadful' energy bill by denying White House and Senate majority leader Bill Frist needed 60 votes to end filibuster; says three senators who opposed bill but who missed vote should be there to vote when Frist tries again to shut down filibuster; three are Sen Ernest Hollings and Democratic presidential candidates John Kerry and John Edwards</p>

        <p>There may be a chance to defeat the dreadful energy bill after all. On Friday, in a rebuff to President Bush and the Republican leadership, Senate opponents blocked a final vote on the bill by denying the White House and Bill Frist, the majority leader, the 60 votes they need to end a filibuster. The supporters of the bill are now two votes short, with time rapidly running out in the current Congressional session.</p>
        <p>The White House has embarked on a fierce lobbying campaign to find the extra votes necessary to move the bill to Mr. Bush's desk for signature, presumably by cutting side deals with pliable senators.

        <p>There may be a chance to defeat the dreadful energy bill after all. On Friday, in a rebuff to President Bush and the Republican leadership, Senate opponents blocked a final vote on the bill by denying the White House and Bill Frist, the majority leader, the 60 votes they need to end a filibuster. The supporters of the bill are now two votes short, with time rapidly running out in the current Congressional session.</p>
        <p>The White House has embarked on a fierce lobbying campaign to find the extra votes necessary to move the bill to Mr. Bush's desk for signature, presumably by cutting side deals with pliable senators. As Arizona's John McCain, a relentless opponent of the bill, observed sardonically in reference to the goodies that are likely to be spread around, ''the store is open.''</p>
        <p>Some senators may be tempted to drop their opposition to the bill if Republican leaders agree to remove a contentious provision protecting makers of MTBE, a hazardous fuel additive, from potential lawsuits. But the bill's problems run much deeper than that. It is a pork-barrel bonanza of special favors likely to cost twice the advertised price of $31 billion. It would also do little to address the country's energy needs, including its mounting dependence on foreign oil, and even less to address the problem of global warming.</p>
        <p>Those who oppose the bill must resist the administration's blandishments and hold their ground. In addition, given the narrowness of Friday's vote, it would be useful if three senators who missed the vote -- each a sworn opponent of the bill -- would actually show up when Mr. Frist tries again to shut down the filibuster. The three are Ernest Hollings of South Carolina and two candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination, John Kerry of Massachusetts and John Edwards of North Carolina.</p>
        <p>And while it is probably asking too much, we can also hope that Friday's vote will give courage to the Midwestern Democrats like Tom Daschle, the minority leader, who continue to allow the bill's ethanol subsidies to the corn farmers to distort their judgment. A little gumption on their part would assure this bill the legislative burial it deserves.</p>
