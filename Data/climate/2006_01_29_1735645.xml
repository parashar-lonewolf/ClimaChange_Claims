        <p>Paul Martin, the prime minister of Canada, ran an attack ad during his unsuccessful campaign that said: ''A Harper victory will put a smile on George W. Bush's face. Well, at least someone will be happy, eh?''</p>
        <p>Well, Mr. Bush probably did smile. Stephen Harper -- the Conservative Party leader, free-enterprise economist, skeptic of the Kyoto climate change protocol and supporter of the American-led invasion of Iraq -- won the national elections on Monday.

        <p>Paul Martin, the prime minister of Canada, ran an attack ad during his unsuccessful campaign that said: ''A Harper victory will put a smile on George W. Bush's face. Well, at least someone will be happy, eh?''</p>
        <p>Well, Mr. Bush probably did smile. Stephen Harper -- the Conservative Party leader, free-enterprise economist, skeptic of the Kyoto climate change protocol and supporter of the American-led invasion of Iraq -- won the national elections on Monday. This might be the first time an American administration took serious notice of a Canadian election since 1988, when Brian Mulroney, a Progressive Conservative, campaigned in support of free trade with the United States and won.</p>
        <p>But how much of a difference will the change in government make to the United States? Probably, not a whole lot.</p>
        <p>Liberal Americans will still be able to point to Canada's liberal social programs. With only 124 seats out of 308 in the House of Commons, Mr. Harper won't be able to end same-sex marriage or national health insurance, even if he wanted to.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harper has already promised not to send troops to Iraq, and the basic bilateral trade and immigration arrangements will probably not change much either, although the Bush administration may help Mr. Harper by working to reduce United States tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber, which would also make building a home south of the border a bit cheaper. Mr. Harper can also be expected to boost border patrols and intelligence sharing with Washington.</p>
        <p>Even symbolic displays of warmer ties between the two countries may be off limits. In 1985, Prime Minister Mulroney and President Ronald Reagan jointly sang ''When Irish Eyes Are Smiling,'' known in Canada as the Shamrock Summit. Mr. Mulroney was widely mocked for showing too much coziness with the Americans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harper seems to have learned this lesson. When the United States ambassador to Canada, David H. Wilkins, gave a speech last December, implicitly admonishing Mr. Martin for introducing the United States into the campaign, Mr. Harper carefully kept his distance.</p>
        <p>''I don't think foreign ambassadors should be expressing their views or intervening in an election,'' he said.</p>
