        <p>As the Bush administration considers withdrawing from air pollution lawsuits against power plants in the Midwest and South, people on both sides of the dispute say the Northeast states that have also sued will be hard-pressed to pursue the cases on their own.</p>
        <p>The suits were filed under a Clean Air Act provision that the administration is reviewing and plans to overhaul. The review was originally scheduled for completion last week, but the Environmental Protection Agency announced on Tuesday that the deadline had been postponed to next month, a delay that officials said was partly due to a split within the administration.</p>
        <p>Spencer Abraham, the energy secretary, and Christie Whitman, the E.P.A. administrator, both advocate broad changes to the enforcement program, known as new source review, to give power companies more flexibility in meeting pollution limits. But administration officials say there is substantial disagreement on the details, with Mr. Abraham's approach including withdrawal from at least some of the suits while Mrs. Whitman favors preserving them.</p>
        <p>Without Washington's participation, most of the cases would be dropped because the states do not have legal standing to pursue them, according to state and federal officials, environmentalists and power companies. They add that the remaining actions would be made far more difficult without the vast resources of the E.P.A. and the Justice Department. And a federal government reversal could dissolve landmark agreements with two power companies that have accepted great reductions in the pollution from their plants.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists are also concerned that even if the new source review program survives, it will be in greatly scaled-back form. They point, among other factors, to President Bush's recent nomination of Donald Schregardus as chief enforcement officer of the E.P.A., a post from which he would play a crucial role in determining whether power plants had violated the law and, if so, how to deal with them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schregardus, as chief environmental officer for the State of Ohio, was part of an administration that strenuously opposed the filing of new source review lawsuits. The Senate has not acted on his nomination.</p>
        <p>''We will pursue these cases no matter what happens in Washington,'' said Eliot L. Spitzer, the New York State attorney general, ''but losing out on the participation and resources of E.P.A. and the Justice Department would be a substantial loss and would make our job much harder, no question.''</p>
        <p>In the Northeast, so much of the pollution arrives on the prevailing winds from the West and South that if New York City and some other areas were to stop all local emissions, they would still violate federal clean air standards. After two decades of steady improvement, the region's air quality leveled off and has even worsened a bit, abetted by hot summers two of the last three years. So far this year, monitoring stations around New York State have recorded 168 ozone readings that violate federal standards, the second-highest figure for any year in the last decade, and a sharp increase from 60 in all of last year.</p>
        <p>In pursuing new source review cases without federal help, the greatest obstacle that the Northeast states would face is geographic. To win a new source review case against a power plant, a state must establish that it has legal standing by proving that its air is measurably affected by the emissions from that plant. While lawyers for the Northeast states have built cases against plants up to 400 miles away, they believe they would be unable to act against more distant plants.</p>
        <p>The states sued 17 plants in Virginia, West Virginia, Indiana and Ohio. (Mr. Spitzer also notified the owners of seven plants in New York that he intended to sue if they did not agree to install pollution controls, and his office is in negotiations with those companies.) Northeast officials have talked with their Southern and Midwestern counterparts about filing their own suits, to broaden their reach, but so far they have found no takers.</p>
        <p>''The states haven't targeted us, and we don't think they could,'' said John Sell, a spokesman for Southern Company, a major power producer in the South that is the subject of a federal suit.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. has sued 34 plants and taken other enforcement actions under new source review against 20 others. The agency signaled last year that it intended to go after many more plants -- in talks with two power companies, it insisted on changes at 12 plants that were not named in its enforcement actions -- and officials said the number could top 100.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A.'s actions have included old coal-fired plants in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Tennessee, Kentucky, Alabama and Illinois -- plants that are beyond the grasp of the Northeastern states.</p>
        <p>''E.P.A. simply has much greater reach than we do, so there's much more they can do,'' said Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut attorney general. ''And they have vastly superior resources, which are critical against these big corporations that have indicated they will fight and delay.''</p>
        <p>Among other things, the states would have to produce sophisticated computer models showing the movement of air pollution over long distances -- the sort of work E.P.A. does already, but the states do not.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer said his office has eight lawyers working on the cases, compared with the dozens the federal government has assigned to the litigation. ''Resources are an enormous issue,'' he said. ''If Washington pulls out, I would say we would have to double the number of people dedicated to these cases.''</p>
        <p>Courts also give a certain deference to federal agencies' interpretation of relevant federal laws -- for instance, to the E.P.A.'s view of the Clean Air Act -- and lawyers on both sides say the states would not receive the same deference.</p>
        <p>A lawyer representing a company that has been sued by both the federal government and the states said, ''There's no question: if the feds go away, my job gets a lot easier.''</p>
        <p>John L. Kirkwood, chief executive  of the American Lung Association, said: ''There's much less the states can do than what the feds can do, and it's harder for them to do it. This really needs the Bush administration's participation.''</p>
        <p>Over the last three decades, federal law has imposed increasingly strict air pollution standards on new power plants. But plants built before those rules were created are exempt from federal controls.</p>
        <p>The federal and state suits charge that power companies have done such extensive work upgrading older plants, under the guise of routine maintenance, that those plants should come under new source review and meet the same standards as new plants. Power companies call that a misinterpretation of the law and say it will prevent them from doing maintenance needed at older plants, leading to more frequent breakdowns.</p>
        <p>At issue in the suits are pre-1970 coal plants that, in some cases, produce up to 10 times as much nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide -- the major contributors to smog and acid rain -- as are permitted from new plants. Power plants produce two-thirds of the nation's sulfur dioxide emissions, and about 30 percent of the nitrogen oxides.</p>
        <p>New York and the E.P.A. filed their first suits in 1999, and six other states -- Connecticut, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Vermont -- later joined in some of the suits. In New Jersey, it was the administration of Mrs. Whitman, then the governor, that sued.</p>
        <p>Last year, three power companies settled E.P.A. actions against them by agreeing to drastic emissions reductions at their plants. One of those settlements, with Tampa Electric in Florida, is final.</p>
        <p>But the two larger deals, reached late in the year with Cinergy, an Ohio utility, and Virginia Electric Power, were tentative, and neither the companies nor the Bush administration has moved to make them final. Both sides have indicated that they might seek to modify the agreements. The two settlements, covering 18 plants, would be by far the largest ever under the Clean Air Act, with each company agreeing to spend more than $1 billion.</p>
