        <p>LEAD: On the bottom of the paperboard container that McDonald's uses for its hash-brown potatoes is the three-arrow symbol that generally denotes a product made of recycled material, and the words ''Recyclable Paper.'' But McDonald's officials concede that the package is not made of recycled paper, is not being recycled and may not even be capable of being recycled because of a promotional label glued to the back.</p>
        <p>On the bottom of the paperboard container that McDonald's uses for its hash-brown potatoes is the three-arrow symbol that generally denotes a product made of recycled material, and the words ''Recyclable Paper.'' But McDonald's officials concede that the package is not made of recycled paper, is not being recycled and may not even be capable of being recycled because of a promotional label glued to the back.</p>
        <p>''It's a little embarrassing,'' said Shelby Yastrow, McDonald's senior vice president for environmental affairs. ''We're going to take the recycling logo off everything except what we are actually recycling.''</p>
        <p>Meaningless, False Claims</p>
        <p>Such labeling typifies what many environmentalists view as a flood of meaningless, irrelevant or false claims being made by corporations trying to look environmentally sensitive, or green. With the 20th anniversary of Earth Day approaching, and major environmental legislation like the clean air measure nearing passage, the number of such claims has been increasing.</p>
        <p>To be sure, many American companies have made sincere efforts in recent months to improve their environmental record. McDonald's, for example, said this week that it would spend $100 million on recycled construction materials used in building and remodeling its restaurants. Last week, the Star-Kist subsidiary of H. J. Heinz said it would stop buying tuna caught by methods that injure dolphins, and most of the industry quickly followed.</p>
        <p>But spokesmen for environmental organizations say other moves have been merely window dressing.</p>
        <p>''The nature of American business has not changed,'' said Alan Hershkowitz, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. ''Right now the environment is a marketing trend they have to respond to. Three years from now, they will be doing something else as socioeconomic issues change.''</p>
        <p>Examples of claims that are not what they seem to be abound. Some marketers of cosmetics labeled ''cruelty free'' may not have actually tested the ingredients in them on animals for toxicity. But the ingredients are often purchased from companies that did such testing, said Jacquelyn Ottman, a marketing consultant in New York.</p>
        <p>Claims that a particular brand of toilet paper is made from recycled paper may be similarly confusing, said researchers at Arthur D. Little Inc., a consulting firm. ''What the consumer may not realize is that almost all toilet paper on the market today is made from recycled fibers,'' the consulting company said in a recent report.</p>
        <p>An 'Ozone Friendly' Spray</p>
        <p>Hubert H. Humphrey 3d, the Attorney General of Minnesota, recently cited the case of a hair-care product, White Rain Styling Mousse, that was labeled ''ozone friendly,'' apparently because it had eliminated ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons as a propellant. For one thing, such CFC's are banned by Federal regulation from all but a few aerosol products. Worse, he added that the substitute, with volatile organic solvents like butane and propane, was an important contributor to smog closer to earth.</p>
        <p>Another product cited by Mr. Humphrey as making misleading claims is Arrid Extra Dry deodorant, for which some cans proclaim, ''Safe for the Ozone Layer.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Humphrey and seven other state law enforcement officers, including New York's, recently formed a group to challenge deceptive or misleading environmental claims for products.</p>
        <p>Under pressure from the group and the Federal Trade Commission, the Mobil Corporation recently said it would remove the term ''degradable'' from boxes of its Hefty plastic trash bags. The bags contain a chemical agent that promotes degradation in the presence of sunlight, but because the vast majority end up buried in landfills, the claim was misleading, the officials said. First Brands, which makes Glad Bags, took similar action.</p>
        <p>Mr. Humphrey said at a recent conference on packaging that unless false or meaningless environmental claims are curbed, ''consumers will grow as disillusioned about the environment as they are about cholesterol.''</p>
        <p>''Wrapping a product in a green package is not enough,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Caution on Claims</p>
        <p>The drive to appear green is being fueled by the rising environmental consciousness of American consumers. ''Just as the 80's saw a proliferation of 'light' products designed to meet growing health awareness, the 90's will be the decade of 'green' products,'' said Dorothy MacKenize, head of product development for the Michael Peters Group, a package design firm.</p>
        <p>But environmental advocates say claims that products are labeled ''environmentally friendly'' and ''good for the environment'' should be treated with the skepticism reserved for foods said to be ''organic'' or ''cholesterol free.''</p>
        <p>''Many of these claims are dubious at best and outright wrong at worst,'' said Jonathan Schorsch, a researcher with the Council on Economic Priorities, a consumer-oriented group.</p>
        <p>''Caveat emptor still holds,'' Mr. Schorsch said. ''Just because a polystyrene container is labeled recyclable, it does not mean much if the nearest recycling plant is hundreds of miles away.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, when Heinz announced recently that it would introduce a new type of plastic ketchup bottle that will be labeled ''recyclable,'' officials of the National Resources Defense Council said they would challenge the assertion in places where no recycling programs for such plastics are in existence.</p>
        <p>David Ruder, Heinz vice president for consumer products, said the company would use the year before the new bottle is introduced to help start recycling programs. And he said the label would help educate customers about how to recycle plastics.</p>
        <p>Labels Criticized</p>
        <p>Many other packaged-products companies are doing things like putting the three-arrows symbol on products and labeling them ''recyclable.'' But environmentalists point out that virtually everything is recyclable with enough time and effort. They say adding labels like ''recyclable'' and ''degradable'' is a cheap way of looking green without getting involved in the hard work of reducing solid waste.</p>
        <p>In the case of the McDonald's hash-brown container, Mr. Yastrow said he was unaware until recently that the recycling symbol was on the package. He said that in years past, environmental groups had urged the company to use the symbol to educate customers that paper products could be recycled.</p>
        <p>Even companies that do not do business directly with the public are stressing their concern for the environment. For example, the Chemical Manufacturers Association recently began what it calls its ''responsible care'' program. It includes assurances that the industry will pay more attention to health, safety and the environment.</p>
        <p>But even Chemical Week magazine, a trade publication that is hardly hostile to the industry, said that the program might have little practical effect because it ''imposes no timetable or quantitative standards to achieve its goals.''</p>
        <p>The conflict between image building and actual practice was highlighted at a recent exhibit in Washington called ''Earth Tech.'' At the exhibit, companies like Du Pont and USX emphasized efforts like the use of bacteria to clean up contaminated waste sites and materials conservation through recycling.</p>
        <p>Diversion Seen</p>
        <p>But some environmentalists said the exhibit was an attempt to divert attention from the pollutants these big industrial companies emit in the course of their operations each year. Peter Bahouth, director of Greenpeace U.S.A., denounced it as ''a slick opportunity for some companies to greenwash their dirt.''</p>
        <p>John McAllister, an environmental affairs official for Du Pont, agreed that the company wants to improve its image. ''We want to show technology that now and in the immediate future will contribute to sustainable development.''</p>
        <p>Some of the ''green'' assertions being made demonstrate considerable imagination. Speaking for the paper industry, John A. Luke, the chairman of the Westvaco Corporation, acknowledged that the industry pumps 250 million tons of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere each year. But, he said, trees on company-owned land absorb one billion tons of the substance each year, which he described as ''a very favorable 4-to-1 ratio.''</p>
        <p>In addition, he said, the trees emit 750 million tons of oxygen a year. These activities, Mr. Luke said, ''are superb environmental contributions which no other industry can claim.''</p>
        <p>A Westvaco spokesman had no immediate response to the observation that the trees would have absorbed the carbon dioxide and emitted the oxygen even if not owned by paper companies.</p>
        <p>Credit Sought</p>
        <p>Alan Lucier, a forestry specialist with the paper industry, said the companies deserved some environmental credit for growing trees on worn out farmland and managing them for faster growth.</p>
        <p>For consumer products companies, so-called green consumerism is becoming increasingly important as surveys indicate that customers will choose items that appear to be environmentally friendly over those that do not. One, by the Michael Peters Group, found that 78 percent of consumers said they would pay more for a product made of recycled or biodegradable materials and that 53 percent had declined to buy a product because of environmental concerns.</p>
        <p>Patrick A. Carson, a vice president of Loblaw's, Canada's largest food store chain, said, ''We are in the early stages of a green revolution'' in which buyers ''will vote at the cash register on ethical, moral and environmental issues.''</p>
        <p>He said when the company offered toilet tissue made of recycled paper, it was the chain's ''best launch in history.''</p>
