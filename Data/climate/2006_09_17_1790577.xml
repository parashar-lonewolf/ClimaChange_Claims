        <p>The start of a new school year has brought nothing but more problems for the Roosevelt school district. The district, which has been under state control for the last four years because of substandard student performance and fiscal difficulties, has uncovered more financial problems.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, when the district closed its financial books for the 2005-6 school year, its new business manager, Stanley Bronski, uncovered a deficit that was at first estimated to exceed $5 million for a budget of $67.6 million.

        <p>The start of a new school year has brought nothing but more problems for the Roosevelt school district. The district, which has been under state control for the last four years because of substandard student performance and fiscal difficulties, has uncovered more financial problems.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, when the district closed its financial books for the 2005-6 school year, its new business manager, Stanley Bronski, uncovered a deficit that was at first estimated to exceed $5 million for a budget of $67.6 million. That has since been recalculated to $4.3 million, said Tom Dunne, a spokesman for the State Education Department.</p>
        <p>How could this have happened in the only district ever taken over by the state? ''The best guess is that anticipated revenues for the year were down while expenses were up,'' Mr. Dunne said.</p>
        <p>The district is now operating on an austerity budget and was forced to cut $3.6 million in planned spending, including its full-day kindergarten program, after the community voted down the budget twice this spring.</p>
        <p>Last Monday, Ronald O. Ross, the superintendent of schools, and Edward McCormick, the president of the Board of Education, met in Albany with the state education commissioner, Richard P. Mills, who has the authority to appoint the district's board and superintendent and has veto power over district spending.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mills ''has instructed them to come up with an aggressive plan to resolve the deficit without harming any academic programs,'' Mr. Dunne said. He said that Mr. Mills also insisted that by Sept. 25, the district must hire an outside business administrator who will report directly to the commissioner.</p>
        <p>But troubles for the 2,800-student district escalated further when State Senator Charles J. Fuschillo Jr. of Merrick, whose district includes Roosevelt, also met with Mr. Mills and called for the removal of Mr. Ross. Mr. Ross has been superintendent since 2004.</p>
        <p>''My concerns over Mr. Ross's tenure date back to a year ago, when I questioned the way he was spending $6 million in academic grants from the state,'' Mr. Fuschillo said. ''With educational oversight, it is inexcusable to have a deficit of that magnitude, and it's time for the commissioner to move in a new direction, with new leadership.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ross declined to comment on the deficit or on Mr. Fuschillo's call for his dismissal.</p>
        <p>$35 Million for Center On New Energy Sources</p>
        <p>The State University at Stony Brook, the Long Island State Senate delegation and the KeySpan Corporation are collaborating on a project that will bring together energy-related research and development projects at a new technology center designed to uncover new energy sources and protect natural resources.</p>
        <p>KeySpan has donated the use of facilities in Islandia for the center's temporary home while a permanent $35 million center is built during the next three years at the old Gyrodyne property in St. James, which the state acquired in an eminent domain case.</p>
        <p>Led by Kenneth P. LaValle and Dean Skelos, the Island's Senate delegation secured the $35 million in state funds for the project. The money will enable Stony Brook University to make plans to establish the research center.</p>
        <p>At a ribbon-cutting ceremony on Sept. 8 in Islandia, more than 70 projects that are under way at Stony Brook, LIPA, KeySpan, Brookhaven National Laboratory and other local universities and research centers were displayed. The projects focus on exploring renewable energy sources, enhancing the performance of traditional fuels and employing advanced fuel cell technology.</p>
        <p>''This center will bring all of these projects together,'' said Yacov A. Shamash, the dean of the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Stony Brook. He said the goal was to develop ''alternative sources of fuel and to improve the efficiency of the current ways of using power.''</p>
        <p>Mr. LaValle said that there was a dire need for new energy sources to fulfill demand in New York State, particularly on Long Island. He said the center could ''create a more efficient and cost-effective source of energy, which will, in turn, contribute to our economic growth.''</p>
        <p>Suffolk Agrees to Monitor Composting's Health Impact</p>
        <p>Suffolk County, responding to complaints from residents who live near composting sites in eastern Long Island, has set up a program to monitor any medical impact the sites might have.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, Steve Levy, the Suffolk County executive, allocated $25,000 for a project involving the county's Health Department and Stony Brook University Medical Center in which pulmonary experts will evaluate residents who say they have respiratory problems.</p>
        <p>''Composting centers are a nuisance regarding odor, but we'd also like to know if there are health implications,'' Mr. Levy said. ''The data we collect will help us make that determination.''</p>
        <p>For many years, residents living near the Long Island Compost Corporation and other composting sites around Manorville, Yaphank and Moriches have complained of odors and have raised concerns about the respiratory effects on young children and people with breathing difficulties.</p>
