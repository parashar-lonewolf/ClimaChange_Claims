        <p>LEAD: More than 100,000 acres of wildlife refuges and historic areas, including the site of the bloodiest day of fighting of the Civil War, are to be given to the Federal Government on Tuesday in what officials believe is the largest single gift of land ever made to the nation.</p>
        <p>More than 100,000 acres of wildlife refuges and historic areas, including the site of the bloodiest day of fighting of the Civil War, are to be given to the Federal Government on Tuesday in what officials believe is the largest single gift of land ever made to the nation.</p>
        <p>The land was quietly purchased in seven Eastern and Southwestern states over the last two years for $21 million - sometimes from under the noses of eager developers - for the Richard King Mellon Foundation of Pittsburgh.</p>
        <p>The foundation's president, Seward Prosser Mellon, said in an interview at the family estate here that in some cases the lands were being threatened by growing urban centers in densely populated parts of the country.</p>
        <p>Site of 23,061 Casualties</p>
        <p>One such property is the Cornfield, a tract on the Antietam National Battlefield in Maryland where 23,061 Union and Confederate soldiers were killed, wounded or listed as missing between sunrise and sunset on Sept. 17, 1862.</p>
        <p>The largest single property is a 93,000-acre tract of wildlife wetlands at Alligator River, N.C., where conservationists hope to reintroduce the endangered red wolf. The parcel was bought with other tracts for $8.8 million.</p>
        <p>Other smaller properties are in New Mexico, Colorado, Virginia, Maine and Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>A symbolic deed to the lands will be turned over in a private ceremony on Tuesday to the Interior Secretary, Manuel Lujan Jr. Management of the lands will be taken over by the department's agencies, including the National Park Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service.</p>
        <p>''These properties I know are worth more commercially, but several owners accepted bargain prices because they want the lands to go to the Government and so be preserved in perpetuity, rather than risk acquisition by developers,'' said Mr. Lujan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mellon said the foundation, one of the country's 15 wealthiest, hoped that its gift would inspire others to buy and preserve properties, particularly in the historic areas near Washington that are threatened by the capital's expansion.</p>
        <p>Environmental preservation has attracted few foundations and only about 3 percent of their annual giving. But the Mellon, an exception, has contributed $170 million to preserve land since 1977, increasing its spending as Federal support dwindled during the Reagan years. At one point, in 1988, public spending for land acquisition dropped to $17 million. In President Bush's first year, the level rose to $205 million, and is now at $250 million, but it is still not enough to protect the thousands of wildlife and parkland sites listed by various Federal and state agencies as endangered.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mellon is not expected to attend Tuesday's ceremony, but in a rare interview here in western Pennsylvania's rolling hill country where the Mellon family maintains offices on a 10,000-acre estate, he told of how the foundation, with $860 million in assets, embarked on a two-year effort to obtain the properties.</p>
        <p>A Boyhood Memory</p>
        <p>Mr. Mellon, at 47 years old the youngest of the four children of the financier and philanthropist Richard King Mellon, said he shared his late father's appreciation for the outdoors and concern for the environment. Richard King Mellon's uncle, Andrew W. Mellon, built the family fortune through the Mellon National Bank of Pittsburgh and was Secretary of the Treasury from 1921 to 1932.</p>
        <p>Even in the seclusion and serenity of the Mellon estate, Mr. Mellon laments that development on nearby Laurel Mountain is bringing acid rain and pollution of streams where he has hunted and fished since boyhood.</p>
        <p>In part, he said, the foundation's trustees, who include a number of environmentalists, decided on their course because of the rising alarm in recent years among preservationists about unchecked encroachment on Civil War landmarks.</p>
        <p>Among the most controversial such instance was the recent purchase of land surrounding the Manassas National Battlefield in Northern Virginia where construction was begun on a shopping mall. Congress eventually intervened and halted the building, but the still unresolved question of restitution could cost the Government as much as $100 million.</p>
        <p>The uproar over the affair focused the attention of Government officials and conservationists alike on other such battle sites, and efforts then turned to protect the unspoiled rural setting surrounding the Antietam battlefield.</p>
        <p>Still under cultivation, the Cornfield attracts thousands of visitors a year. One frequent viewer, Prof. James M. McPherson of Princeton University, said, ''Walking the land makes history so vivid to my students, I've seen tears come.''</p>
        <p>'We Saw the Opportunity'</p>
        <p>The clamor to protect Antietam, as well as Gettysburg and other battlefields, worked in the foundation's favor, said Mr. Mellon. ''We lucked in because we saw the opportunity and seized it.''</p>
        <p>The six trustees agreed to devote a third of the foundation's annual budget for land acquisition and related conservation, while continuing to spend half its income for social services and other benefits in western Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>Recognizing that word of the Mellon Foundation's interest could inflate property prices, it asked the Conservation Fund, a little-known nonprofit organization in Arlington, Va., to make the acquisitions quietly. Under the direction of Patrick F. Noonan, the fund's president, the organization inspected more than 100 potential sites identified by the Department of the Interior, which recommended priorities.</p>
        <p>Though making such acquisitions sounds like a simple matter, said Mr. Mellon, the philanthropy has encountered resistance over the years from farmers, developers and special interest groups. He said such groups had lobbied members of Congress to oppose legislation required, for example, to protect land around national monuments and parklands.</p>
        <p>Concern for Future</p>
        <p>Mr. Mellon said he hoped that others in a position to aid in the preservation of such lands would persist.</p>
        <p>''If you feel you are right, you go ahead and do it, but it is never a black-or-white decision,'' he said. ''Still, in the final analysis, the most important point to remember is that this land next month or next year could be turned into a shopping mall or a trailer park. You have to keep thinking, 'Tomorrow.' ''</p>
        <p>Before the transfer of the 10 parcels, Mr. Mellon said, he plans to visit each.</p>
        <p>''The excitement for me is the warm feeling of stepping on land, floating downriver or walking through the wilderness and saying, 'We've preserved this.' ''</p>
        <p>These are the sites and the donated parcels:</p>
        <p>* Alligator River, N.C.: 93,000 acres between the Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds, for more habitat for waterfowl and wildlife.</p>
        <p>* Antietam National Battlefield, Md.: three tracts totaling 280 acres, including the Cornfield.</p>
        <p>* East Cavalry Field, Pa.: 266 acres, includes the site of a Civil War cavalry engagement.</p>
        <p>* Five Forks, Va.: 930 acres of farmland near the Petersburg National Battlefield, known as the Waterloo of the Confederacy.</p>
        <p>* Forked Lightning Ranch, N.M.: a 5,556-acre ranch, encompassing 100 Indian and Spanish archeological sites and the site of the Union's Civil War headquarters during the battle at nearby Glorieta.</p>
        <p>* Mackay Island National Wildlife Refuge, N.C.: a 130-acre area adjacent to a major migratory waterfowl refuge.</p>
        <p>* Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge, Me.: a 122-acre property on Cutts Island, for guarding the integrity of the refuge.</p>
        <p>* Rocky Mountain National Park, Colo.: two tracts totaling 468 acres, for protecting elk migration.</p>
        <p>* Shenandoah National Park, Va.: two parcels totaling 1,287 acres, for guarding the park from encroaching residential and industrial growth.</p>
        <p>* Wilderness Area of Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania Memorial Natonal Military Park, Va.: a 135-acre property near a Civil War battlefield.</p>
        <p>Besides the 10 parcels going to the Federal Government this week, other sites with a higher total value will be given to state governments in the next year, said Mason Walsh Jr., a foundation trustee. These include parcels in Maine, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Rhode Island and Montana.</p>
