        <p>LEAD: It was reported on July 24 in the New Jersey Weekly it was reported (The Environment, on July 24) that Du Pont, the only company still disposing of industrial waste at a site the 106 miles offshore, site, planned to withdraw its application for a Federal permit to continue.</p>
        <p>It was reported on July 24 in the New Jersey Weekly it was reported (The Environment, on July 24) that Du Pont, the only company still disposing of industrial waste at a site the 106 miles offshore, site, planned to withdraw its application for a Federal permit to continue.</p>
        <p>The dumped waste was ferric chloride, a byproduct of titanium dioxide extraction from ilmenite sand. Ferric chloride is also used extensively as a settling aid in municipal and industrial waste treatment. The last discharge at that site was March 1987.</p>
        <p>For the last year, the Thousand Fathom Club, an association of deep-water anglers, has conducted a nationwide boycott of Du Pont products, including fishing line, in protest over their use of the disposal site.</p>
        <p>The Ciba-Geigy Toms River chemical facility, under intense pressure from Ocean County and environmentalists, has built and put into operation a tertiary treatment plant for its industrial waste. To deal with ground-water seepage from a Superfund site on its property, it now wants to pump contaminated water from that site and treat it in its system. The Environmental Protection Agency approves the plan.</p>
        <p>Save Our Ocean, an Ocean County environmental group, planned a mock ''ocean funeral,'' contending that ''the final death knell'' ''will ring if Ciba-Geigy Corporation is allowed to dump the contamination from their Superfund site through their discharge pipeline into the ocean.''</p>
        <p>Both environmental groups are shooting well wide of the mark. The amount of ferric chloride dumped was trivial and, if anything, mixed into the same waters that now receive millions of gallons of sewage sludge, would help clarify them. As for Ciba-Geigy, the attention should be placed on cleaning up its Superfund site, not on its effluent, which will be clean enough to be potable.</p>
        <p>The state of the environment in the New York Bight and its estuaries is bad enough and substantial environmental problems numerous enough that rousing the public over meaningless issues does little more than draw attention from critical ones and undercuts the credibility of all environmental groups with an informed citizenry.</p>
        <p>Where is the hue and cry for improvements in municipal sewage treatment? According to a 1980 General Accounting Office study, 87 percent of 242 randomly selected treatment plants were in violation of their National Pollutant Discharge Elimination system permits for at least one month of the year, and 31 percent of those were considered to be in serious violation for most of the year.</p>
        <p>Because the New York City sewer system combines street runoff with household and industrial sewage, during periods of rain the total volume exceeds the treatment works' capacity to handle it. Ten percent of the city's sewage goes into surrounding waters totally raw. Add to that another eight billion gallons a year of undiluted raw waste dumped or bypassed by city treatment plants because of mechanical failures or other reasons.</p>
        <p>New Jersey's publicly owned treatment works discharge into the Raritan and adjacent waters have a similarly lamentable record. According to a 1987 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Estuary-of-the-Month symposium report on Long Island Sound, the nitrogen loading in lower New York Bay is 30 times higher than the average United States estuary.</p>
        <p>A study of industrial dischargers by the Office of Technology Assessment states that although the organic chemicals, plastics and synthetic fibers manufacturers have reduced their effluents by over 99 percent, other industrial groups, such as metal finishers and platers, have made little or no progress at all.</p>
        <p>The Clean Water Act of 1972 is now 16 years old. Where is the E.P.A.'s congressionally mandated enforcement of the cleanup directives of this law?</p>
        <p>Where is the leadership, government and private, to stir the public to demand better municipal sewage treatment, industrial compliance with pretreatment standards, the elimination of combined sewer outfalls, control of polluted and debris-laden street runoff, reduction of acid rain and development restraint near environmentally sensitive wetland areas?</p>
        <p>We must concentrate on first things first. As a 1987 environmental conference hosted by Save The Bay pointed out, environmental law and order, i.e., the strict enforcement of laws already on the books, should be a top priority of Federal, state and local officials and should be a major concern of all citizens.
