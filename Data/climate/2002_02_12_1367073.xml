        <p>At first glance, President Bush's proposed budget for the 2003 fiscal year includes a healthy increase for scientific research and development: $8.6 billion, or 8.3 percent, to a record $111.8 billion.</p>
        <p>But a closer look shows that the scientific budgets for most agencies will remain level or even decline under the president's plan.</p>
        <p>The big winners, it turns out, are in just two agencies, each with a heavy emphasis on security in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks. One, the Defense Department research budget, would receive $5.4 billion more than in 2002, a 10.9 percent increase, and the other, the National Institutes of Health, would receive $3.7 billion, or 15.7 percent, more.</p>
        <p>Of the overall $8.6 billion increase, more than $3 billion would go to antiterrorism activity like vaccines and treatments for biological attack, and to homeland security, with the health institutes and the Pentagon receiving most of that money. Most of the Pentagon's added research budget is earmarked for weapons.</p>
        <p>At a budget briefing last week, Dr. John H. Marburger III, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and Mr. Bush's science adviser, said science had done well at a time the country was engaged in a war against terrorism, financing homeland security and dealing with recession. ''This is a good budget for science,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Most of the leading departments and agencies that conduct research and development received increases for those activities, Dr. Marburger said, and the administration has proposed a balanced scientific program that meets the nation's needs.</p>
        <p>''When we talk about balance, that doesn't mean that everything will go up,'' Dr. Marburger said. ''We need to make the case for what areas of science deserve increases and give them to them.''</p>
        <p>Others were more critical. Representative Sherwood Boehlert, the New York Republican who is chairman of the House Science Committee, said he was pleased with the substantial increase in spending on health research and noted that nonmilitary research would grow 1 percent above inflation. But Mr. Boehlert added that research spending ''would remain anemic under this budget'' and that increases for scientific work related to homeland security focused too much on immediate results, as opposed to basic research not directed at a short-term outcome.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush called for increases in three multiagency science initiatives with economic effects, including a 17.3 percent increase, to $679 million, for research in nanotechnology, the science of manipulating matter on the molecular scale. The Networking and Information Technology project to advance computing and software would receive an increase of almost 3 percent, to $1.9 billion, and financing for research on global climate change would climb 5 percent, to $1.8 billion.</p>
        <p>But some agencies found that increases in their research requests meant that other programs would have to be held in check.</p>
        <p>For instance, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration would receive a 5.3 percent increase in its research budget, but just a 1.4 percent increase over all. The human space flight allotment, including money for the International Space Station and the shuttle program, would drop by 11 percent, or $700 million. NASA proposed $15 million to start a New Frontiers program for less expensive planetary missions, but canceled its outer-planets program, including the first spacecraft planned to visit Pluto.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation's budget would increase 5 percent, to $5 billion. Its research budget would rise 3.6 percent, to $3.7 billion. But more than half of the research increase comes from transferring science-related programs to the foundation from other agencies where science budgets were cut accordingly, including the National Sea Grant Program from the Commerce Department, water-science research from the Interior Department and environmental education from the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A.'s research budget would rise 6.2 percent, to $650 million. But much of that increase would come from $77.5 million designated to study homeland security.</p>
        <p>The Energy Department's research budget would fall 8 percent, to $8.5 billion, with military programs suffering the biggest cuts after big increases the previous year for counterterrorism. The agency's Office of Science, which pays for research in physics and basic energy sciences, would receive a modest increase to $3.3 billion, to cover inflation.</p>
        <p>Other significant changes in research budgets include a decline of 9.3 percent for the Agriculture Department, to $2.1 billion, and a 1.3 percent decline for the Commerce Department, to $1.1 billion. Pentagon spending on basic and applied research would generally remain flat. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency would be an exception, with a proposed increase of 19.2 percent, to $2.7 billion.</p>
        <p>The Interior Department's research budget would decline 4.8 percent, to $628 million. The department's largest science agency, the United States Geological Survey, would see its research budget fall 7 percent, to $542 million.</p>
