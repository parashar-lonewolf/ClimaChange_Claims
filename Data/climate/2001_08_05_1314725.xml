        <p>WHEN Dennis A. Tito became the first space tourist earlier this year, it reminded me that I, too, had been an amateur astronaut during my formative years before World War II in Bronxville.</p>
        <p>In fairness, I should acknowledge that I was assisted by my friends Todd (The Freak) Frohman and Morell (Beer) Coon.</p>
        <p>Our interest in rocketry and space exploration had been stimulated by Mr. Rickets, the beloved Bronxville School science teacher. He used to read to us passages from Jules Verne, and then talk about space travel as if it might really come to pass in our lifetime. We learned (and were tested on) esoteric bits of space lore like the escape velocity of the earth -- the speed a space vehicle would have to attain to break loose from the earth's gravity. It was, if memory serves, 17 miles per second.</p>
        <p>Freak Frohman, Beer Coon and I were deep into chemistry at that time, and so it was natural for us to start our experiments with rockets fueled with a pyrotechnical witch's brew.</p>
        <p>The first of our primitive space vehicles suffered from the same defect that plagued the early NASA program -- they blew up on the launching pad. The problem seemed to be that the gunpowder we used for rocket fuel burned too rapidly. In fact, it exploded.</p>
        <p>A breakthrough came about one lazy summer afternoon when Freak Frohman and I were netting crayfish in the Bronx River, and he turned to me and said, ''Maybe that stuff my father squirts in his drink could be the propulsive agent we're looking for.''</p>
        <p>It was a revolutionary idea, fundamentally changing the focus of our entire space program. It requires careful explanation.</p>
        <p>The first thing to understand is that Freak Frohman's father liked his liquor. At about 4 in the afternoon, he would proclaim, ''Well, the sun is over the yardarm.'' He was an old sailor and had been brought up to believe that the sun's descent in the heavens was an internationally recognized signal to break out the booze.</p>
        <p>Mr. Frohman liked to make his own whiskey and soda. For this, he kept a supply of small metallic cylinders filled with compressed carbon dioxide and sealed with a lead plug. He would fit this cylinder into a device attached to the top of a bottle containing water and a slug of whiskey. When he compressed a lever, a spike would puncture the lead plug and allow the carbon dioxide to blast into the drink, creating a fizzy beverage.</p>
        <p>Freak Frohman had been observing this ritual for as long as he could remember, and suddenly it occurred to him that his father's CO2  canisters might be suitable as rocket motors.</p>
        <p>When he explained all that to me, I gave him a thumbs up. Jules Verne, here we come!</p>
        <p>We began this new phase by building a launcher. This was far more sophisticated than our previous approach, in which the booster was Scotch-taped to a stick and the stick stuck in the ground. The launcher was a wooden trough made from old crates.</p>
        <p>One of us would hold the launcher at the appropriate angle for a moon landing. Another -- usually me -- would hold the point of a nail against the lead plug in the metal cylinder, slam it with a hammer and duck.</p>
        <p>Our first tests were conducted on Scout Field between the Bronx River and the railroad tracks.</p>
        <p>After a few tries, we got the hang of it. Following the hammer blow, there would be a loud hiss, and the booster would rattle up the launcher and hurl the space vehicle aloft -- held on course by tail fins.</p>
        <p>The thing would usually have expended its fuel at an altitude of 200 feet, but our space vehicle would continue climbing for another 100 feet or so like a homesick angel. Then it would level off and commence re-entry.</p>
        <p>Pretty soon, the extended range of our rockets -- it grew to almost a quarter of a mile -- made it clear we had outgrown the Scout Field. Accordingly, we shifted operations to Grassy Sprain Reservoir. But water landings created a distraction. Some 30 or 40 ducks inhabited the reservoir, and when they saw our space vehicle headed their way, they took flight. It was a spectacular sight.</p>
        <p>And that created a temptation we could not resist. We took to using our rockets to ''herd'' the ducks back and forth across the reservoir.</p>
        <p>Nature lovers strolling nearby scolded us for our cruelty and threatened to call the police, so we worked in the evening when the area was largely deserted.</p>
        <p>In all our trials at Grassy Sprain Reservoir, our rockets never murdered a single person -- or even a duck. I swear.</p>
        <p>At about that time, Beer Coon solved an important mathematical puzzle, which influenced all of our future efforts. Using his slide rule, he calculated that at the top of the arc our space vehicle traversed it was doing about 35 miles per hour.</p>
        <p>The question that posed was how many cylinders from Mr. Frohman's liquor cabinet would be required to get our space vehicle from 35 miles per hour to 17 miles per second? A million cylinders, maybe? Two million?</p>
        <p>Whatever the number, I felt confident that it wouldn't be long before Freak Frohman, Beer Coon and I would be streaking through the firmament on our way to the moon.</p>
        <p>Don't laugh. Given time that summer, we could have pushed the envelope dramatically. The main hitch was that it was already August, and we had to buy new sneakers and get ready for eighth grade.</p>
