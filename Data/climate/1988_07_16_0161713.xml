        <p>LEAD: Rich MacDonald spends most of his time collecting clouds from the top of Whiteface Mountain. Often the clouds carry part of the industrial Midwest to this scenic peak - pollution that will fall to the ground as acid rain.</p>
        <p>Rich MacDonald spends most of his time collecting clouds from the top of Whiteface Mountain. Often the clouds carry part of the industrial Midwest to this scenic peak - pollution that will fall to the ground as acid rain.</p>
        <p>''It's fairly easy to collect rain,'' said Mr. MacDonald, surveying the mountains from his laboratory 4,900 feet above sea level. ''But to collect clouds, you have to go somewhere that's a little more exposed.''</p>
        <p>Mr. MacDonald's cloud-collection work here at the Whiteface Mountain Field Station of the Atmospheric Sciences Research Center is part of an expanding effort by scientists across the country to learn whether acid precipitation - long known to be damaging lakes - harms forests, too.</p>
        <p>The field station, part of the State University of New York, is 10 miles northeast of Lake Placid; halfway down the mountain is the field station's other laboratory, housed in an old ski lodge. The field station, which opened in 1972, was one of the first to collect data on acid rain. Effects on Forests More Subtle</p>
        <p>The work of the dozen scientists at Whiteface Mountain puts them squarely at the center of the national debate over what is causing acid rain and how to combat it. The debate pits Northeastern states like New York and Vermont, which have suffered the most damage from acid rain, against industrial Midwestern states like Ohio, whose power plants and other industries are emitting much of the pollution suspected to be causing the acid rain.</p>
        <p>To many scientists, as well as longtime residents of the Adirondacks, the effects of acid precipitation on lakes and streams are already obvious. A three-year survey recently completed by New York's Department of Environmental Conservation has found that one-quarter of lakes and ponds in the region are so acidic that they are unlikely to support fish. An additional one-fifth of the lakes are so acidic they are considered ''endangered.''</p>
        <p>Lake damage ''is one of the big changes that is taking place,'' said Tim Brown, lab manager for the Whiteface Mountain Field Station. ''People can see that they fished a certain stream for 40 or 50 years and the last trout they caught was five years ago.''</p>
        <p>But the effects of acid rain on the forests so far are more subtle and still poorly understood. An apparent increase in the number of dead red spruce trees, the predominant tree throughout much of the Adirondacks, has popularized an ominous new term - red spruce ''die-back'' - and a decline in tree growth in the Adirondacks has prompted concern. In addition, some longtime Adirondack residents say they are disturbed that the hillsides have lost their blueish hue. Several Possible Causes</p>
        <p>Scientists caution, however, that they do not know if these phenomena are primarily, or even partly, the result of acid rain, or whether there are other causes, such as drought, disease or other pollutants. Hence, the dozen experiments hidden among the trees of Whiteface Mountain.</p>
        <p>In one experiment, branches are encased in clear plastic ''branch chambers,'' in which the atmosphere can be carefully controlled, to sort out the effects of different pollutants on the trees. In another experiment, called the Integrated Forest Study, scientists collect rainwater before it hits the trees, after it has dropped through the forest canopy and again after it has seeped into the ground. The study is designed to assess how chemicals in the rain interact with the trees.</p>
        <p>The aim of Mr. MacDonald's cloud-collection project, which is financed by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency at five sites in addition to Whiteface Mountain, is to determine what role cloud water may play in damaging trees. Controlling Actions Upwind</p>
        <p>Because cloud water - tiny droplets that can cohere to become rain -have a large surface area in relation to their volume, and because acids tend to form on the surface of drops, cloud water is usually several times more acidic than rain water. At the top of Whiteface Mountain, which is under cloud cover about 40 percent of the year, trees spend much of their time immersed in an acidic bath.</p>
        <p>Whenever clouds roll over the mountain, Mr. MacDonald, whose official title is program manager of the Mountain Cloud Chemistry Project, hurries up to the peak, sticks his cloud collector into the air and starts taking samples. The 2 1/2-foot-high cloud collector, which was pioneered by scientists at Whiteface, consists of Teflon strings threaded between two plates; when a cloud hits the strings, water from it condenses on the strings and drips into a tube. The water is then analyzed for acids.</p>
        <p>Measurements taken at Whiteface Mountain show that the region receives some of the dirtiest rain in the country when the wind is blowing from the Midwest. In the Adirondacks, rain from the Midwest often is more than 100 times as acidic as rain from Canada.</p>
        <p>''We can't control what's going to hit us if we can't control what's happening upwind,'' Mr. Brown said.</p>
        <p>Like most scientists, those at Whiteface Mountain are not ready to reach any conclusions until all their data have been analyzed in several years. But having watched the fish populations of the Adirondacks dwindle and, in many areas, die off, many are concerned that the forest is next.</p>
