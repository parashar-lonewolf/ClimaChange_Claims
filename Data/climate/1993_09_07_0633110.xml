        <p>RUSSIAN scientists drilling deep into the Antarctic ice sheet have reached a depth of 8,694 feet, sampling ice formed from snow that fell near the South Pole 270,000 to 280,000 years ago.

        <p>RUSSIAN scientists drilling deep into the Antarctic ice sheet have reached a depth of 8,694 feet, sampling ice formed from snow that fell near the South Pole 270,000 to 280,000 years ago. More than a half mile of ice and samples of snow, dust and atmosphere more than 500,000 years old remain before they reach bedrock.</p>
        <p>The Antarctic samples are being compared with those from two similar holes drilled to bedrock from the crest of the Greenland ice sheet by American and European teams. The deepest ice there is thought to be 250,000 years old.</p>
        <p>Progress in the Antarctic hole, at Vostok, was reported in a recent issue of the journal Nature. While the digging has mainly been done by Russians, the project is a joint effort by Russian, American and French scientists. The results were recently discussed in a telephone interview by one of the 17 authors of the Nature study, Dr. Todd Sowers of the Graduate School of Oceanography at the University of Rhode Island.</p>
        <p>The chief surprise from the Greenland drilling was evidence that the climate, while relatively stable for the 8,000 years since the last ice age, had oscillated suddenly and radically both during ice ages and in the warm periods between them. Slow Accumulation Rate</p>
        <p>Such short-term oscillations cannot be identified in the Vostok ice, said Dr. Sowers, because the accumulation rate was very slow and the annual layers are so thin that short changes cannot be identified. In Greenland the accumulation is nine inches a year, while at Vostok it is only one-tenth that much.</p>
        <p>But analysis of the Vostok ice has shown that the climate was uniformly cold during the next-to-last ice age, from 200,000 to 140,000 years ago, with less temperature variation than during the most recent ice age, the report in Nature said. The ice being sampled now dates from the previous interglacial period, more than 200,000 years ago, and indicates a period of particularly warm temperatures about 215,000 years ago.</p>
        <p>The Russians drilling at Vostok work through the frigid winter night, Dr. Sowers said, sometimes suffering stuck drills and other difficulties. They now drill about 600 feet a year. Much of the analysis has been done in French laboratories. Since the three-nation collaboration began in the southern summer of 1989-1990, most of the supplies and personnel have been flown in and the ice samples hauled out by American aircraft based at McMurdo Sound.</p>
        <p>The Antarctic ice that formed during the ice ages, like that in Greenland and in ancient Chinese glacier ice, is 5 to 20 times richer in dust than that from interglacial periods. This is thought to have been caused by extensive ice age deserts, as the continental shelves were laid bare when sea levels dropped. Strong surface winds may also have been a factor.</p>
        <p>Strontium and neodymium isotopes in dust collected by the French are characteristic of desert dust from Patagonia at the extreme south of South America, as opposed to samples from Australia and the Kalahari and Namibian deserts of Africa.</p>
