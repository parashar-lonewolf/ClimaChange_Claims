        <p>Morning Not-So-Glory?</p>
        <p>With its heart-shaped leaves and funnel-like flowers, the tall morning glory may look good on a garden trellis. But farmers take a dim view of wild Ipomoea purpurea; for them, tall morning glories are a noxious vine that can reduce crop yields. So they use chemicals, notably RoundUp, one of the most popular herbicides in the world, to keep the weeds down.</p>
        <p>Now, after decades of RoundUp use, tall morning glories are becoming tolerant to its active ingredient, glyphosphate. But a new study suggests a way to slow down this evolution of glyphosate tolerance.</p>
        <p>In the study, Regina S. Baucom and Rodney Mauricio of the University of Georgia conducted genetic analyses of tall morning glories grown from seeds from plants that had been regularly sprayed with RoundUp for nearly a decade. They found considerable genetic variation for glyphosate tolerance, indicating that the chemical can be a selective force. When the herbicide is used, variants that are more tolerant of it have an evolutionary advantage.</p>
        <p>But the study, published in the current issue of The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that the more tolerant variants had an evolutionary disadvantage as well. When glyphosate is not used, they produced far fewer seeds than less tolerant ones.</p>
        <p>The researchers say understanding the dynamics of these two evolutionary forces may help control how fast glyphosate tolerance develops. If more and more fields are sprayed with RoundUp, tolerant varieties will have the edge. But if more fields are left RoundUp-free, the less tolerant varieties will prosper.</p>
        <p>The researchers suggest that relatively simple techniques, like occasionally spraying with alternative herbicides, might be enough to give the less-tolerant plants the upper hand.</p>
        <p>A Comet's Lingering Effects</p>
        <p>Ten years ago, about two dozen fragments of the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 collided with Jupiter in one of the most spectacular events ever observed by astronomers.</p>
        <p>The comet's rock and ice vaporized, adding large amounts of nitrogen-, oxygen- and sulfur-bearing molecules to Jupiter's atmosphere at about 45 degrees south latitude. New molecules, including hydrogen cyanide, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, formed from the impacts and from later alteration by sunlight.</p>
        <p>Now, observations by an infrared spectrometer aboard the Cassini spacecraft show some of the lingering atmospheric effects in greater detail. The findings, part of a wide-ranging report on Jupiter's atmosphere by an international team of researchers, have been published online by the journal Science.</p>
        <p>The instrument measured the north-to-south distributions of hydrogen cyanide and carbon dioxide. Hydrogen cyanide is fairly stable, so it provides an indication of how much mixing occurs in the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>The Cassini observations, made in late 2000-early 2001, found that six years after the impacts, hydrogen cyanide was still most abundant at the impact latitude. It decreased smoothly northward, up to about 50 degrees north. Above that latitude, and southward of 50 degrees south, there was far less of the gas.</p>
        <p>Carbon dioxide showed a very different distribution. Most of it was found near the south pole, south of 60 degrees latitude, and above 30 degrees south, it was barely detectable, except above 70 degrees north.</p>
        <p>Something is clearly affecting the carbon dioxide distribution, perhaps a chemical reaction in the atmosphere unrelated to the impacts. But the researchers say more studies will be necessary to figure it out.</p>
        <p>A New Moon for Neptune</p>
        <p>It's official: Neptune now has 13 moons.</p>
        <p>The planet has always been something of a laggard in the moon department compared with the other gaseous planets, with the last confirmed satellites having been discovered in 1989.</p>
        <p>But five small bodies, found in 2002 and 2003 by an international team led by Matthew J. Holman of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and J.J. Kavelaars of the National Research Council of Canada, have now been added to the list. The five, from 20 to 30 miles in diameter, are in large, irregular orbits.</p>
        <p>Winemaking's Waste: A Good Thing</p>
        <p>By now it's well known that a little bit of wine can be good for you. But even the waste from winemaking can have benefits, researchers say.</p>
        <p>Scientists from two Turkish universities have found that extract of grape pomace -- the seeds, skin and stems left after the fruit is crushed to make juice -- inhibits the growth of 14 types of bacteria, including those that can spoil food or cause salmonella and other food-borne illnesses.</p>
        <p>''Grape pomace extract is a natural weapon against bacteria,'' Dr. Osman Sagdic, a professor in the food engineering department at Erciyes University and an author of a paper describing the findings in The Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture, said in an e-mail message.</p>
        <p>Dr. Osman and his colleagues used pomace from the most common red and white grapes used for winemaking in Turkey. The pomace was dried and ground, and extracts were prepared. Analyses showed that they had relatively high concentrations of phenolic compounds, the substances in wine that have antioxidant qualities.</p>
        <p>The researchers then tested the extracts, mixed with methanol in concentrations ranging from .5 to 20 percent, against a who's who of nasty bacteria, including E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacter aerogenes. E. coli O157:H7, for instance, has been responsible for several food-poisoning deaths in recent years.</p>
        <p>The researchers found that growth of 13 of the bacterial types was inhibited at concentrations of 2.5 percent or higher; while growth of the 14th, Yersinia enterocolitica, was inhibited at 5 percent.</p>
        <p>In a different kind of test involving the growth of bacterial colonies in nutrient broth, the extracts were found to work effectively against E. coli and S. aureus at concentrations as low as .5 percent.</p>
        <p>There's no shortage of pomace in the world, both from winemaking and the production of foods like vinegar. Much of it is used as animal feed, but Dr. Sagdic said the research suggested an alternative use, one that is both low-cost and all-natural. ''These extracts may be used in food formulations as preservatives,'' he wrote. ''And people prefer natural preservatives in the place of synthetic counterparts in foods.''</p>
