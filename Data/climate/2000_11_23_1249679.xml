        <p>Protests at climate-treaty talks here reached a high pitch today. Demonstrators climbed into the rafters of a central room, blockaded doorways, passed out Christmas stockings stuffed with coal and splattered the top American negotiator with a cream pie at a news conference tonight.</p>
        <p>The incident occurred halfway through the second week of contentious talks, due to wind up on Friday, in which delegates from 175 countries are debating ways to slow emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases, chiefly from burning fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>The meeting, seeking to create environmental and economic policies to carry out a treaty negotiated in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, has been the focus of a growing protests. The demonstration today centered on contentions that loopholes would prevent cuts in the use of fossil fuel.</p>
        <p>The United States under secretary of state for global affairs, Frank E. Loy, had just begun defending the American stance in the talks, which has been criticized by European officials and environmental groups as too weak, when a woman jumped from her seat and threw the pie in his face.</p>
        <p>Wiping whipped cream from his lip, Mr. Loy cut short his talk and later issued a statement that said: ''On the eve of Thanksgiving, pumpkin pie would have been a more traditional choice, but what I really want is a strong agreement to fight global warming. I'm headed back to the negotiating table right now with that aim.''</p>
        <p>Environmental groups that are lobbying delegations and observing discussions disavowed the attack. ''Many are frustrated by the slow pace of negotiations and the lack of domestic action against global warming,'' said a letter issued by several dozen environmental groups. ''However, we believe there are more constructive ways to achieve our goals of preventing dangerous climate change.''</p>
        <p>The Kyoto Protocol calls for industrialized nations to reduce their combined greenhouse-gas releases by 2012 to a level at least 5 percent below emissions in 1990.</p>
        <p>Earlier today, negotiators said, some progress had been made on several important sticking points, including the roles of nuclear power and the situation in Russia, where emissions have plunged because of economic decline. That has produced a windfall of pollution credits that Russia might eventually sell to countries that are unwilling or unable to reduce emissions.</p>
        <p>Nuclear power has been a pivotal issue for the European Union and many environmental groups, which have pressed to have it excluded from a list of technologies that wealthy countries could export to poor countries to help them avoid future emissions of carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>But Canada, China and the United States oppose such a ban. And France, despite its outward opposition, relies heavily on nuclear plants for its electricity.</p>
        <p>Tonight, it appeared that language was evolving that would give strong preference under the treaty to less controversial nonpolluting options like wind turbines, but would not explicitly banish nuclear plants.</p>
        <p>Separately, Russia proposed that any income it received from selling pollution credits would go into a ''green fund'' that would be used to pay only for energy-efficiency projects. Bill Hare, the chief representative of Greenpeace International and a longtime critic of Russia's selling its pollution credits, said the proposal was a move in the right direction. ''This looks like a positive initiative,'' he said.</p>
