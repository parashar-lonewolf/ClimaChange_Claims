        <p>THE struggle over the first national energy legislation in a decade culminated Friday when the Senate failed by three votes to cut off debate on the bill, leaving the measure -- and American energy policy -- in limbo.</p>
        <p>Supporters of the bill warned of dire consequences should it not pass. ''Failing to pass this bill will mean losing every incentive we need to maximize American energy production, to stabilize the energy market, to improve the power grid, and to create jobs,'' said Senator Peter W. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico.</p>
        <p>But the sudden stall came over what appeared to be a relatively minor issue -- the costs of a provision protecting oil companies from lawsuits filed over water contaminated with the gasoline additive MTBE. This leads to a question: If the nation were truly confronting an energy crisis, would the first energy bill in years, sought by the White House, Republican leaders and some Democrats, entailing $31 billion in eventual costs, suffer this kind of defeat?</p>
        <p>The answer, many supporters and opponents of the legislation acknowledge, is no.</p>
        <p>The 1,200-page bill was built on President Bush's 2001 National Energy Policy, which, responding in part to the power shortages that roiled California, spoke of ''our nation's energy crisis,'' and called for large investments in energy of all kinds -- old-fashioned, renewable, nuclear, alternative.</p>
        <p>But California's problems, like last summer's great blackout, were the result of flawed policies and ineffectual regulation, not a shortage of gigawatts or oil, according to the findings of government commissions and scientists.</p>
        <p>The real crises on the horizon are rising dependence on foreign oil, uncertain natural gas supplies and the climate impact of emissions from unabated burning of fossil fuels, say some energy analysts and environmentalists.</p>
        <p>To its critics, then, the stalled energy bill is merely a ''porkfolio'' of special-interest spending that, among many expensive provisions, doubles the amount of ethanol produced from corn, a process that uses far more energy than it provides, and authorizes a uranium enrichment plant in New Mexico that could cost $1 billion.</p>
        <p>In addition, there is so much money for boosting the use of coal, the fuel that scientists say contributes the most to global warming, that Jack Gerard, the president of the National Mining Association, issued a statement proclaiming, ''The grants, loans, tax incentives and research dollars for coal in this bill will give an unprecedented demand stimulus to coal-based economies.''</p>
        <p>Through the debate on the bill, Mr. Bush maintained some distance, lauding Congress's efforts to write the energy package, but not embracing the legislation itself. But late Friday, the president told reporters, ''For the sake of our national security and economic security, the Senate's got to pass this bill.''</p>
        <p>But Steven M. Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a private research group, disagrees with the administration's basic approach. The cheapest way to harvest energy, he says, is to use less of it. Indeed, he applauds the conservation measures included in the energy bill, like higher efficiency standards for refrigerators.</p>
        <p>''If this was just a bill that contained the efficiency provisions, I'd probably say it's an excellent bill,'' Mr. Nadel said.</p>
        <p>Most advocates of conservation agree, however, that the country will not move in that direction until Americans are faced with a costly energy crisis.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nadel noted that the first time Congress wrote bills combining energy conservation and alternatives to fossil fuels was 30 years ago, as Americans sat in blocks-long lines at gas stations.</p>
        <p>IN large part through measures requiring higher gas-mileage standards for cars, such legislation led to strong economic growth and simultaneous sharp drops in energy use. From 1979 to 1986, while gross domestic product grew 20 percent, Americans cut total energy use 5 percent, said Amory B. Lovins, a founder of the Rocky Mountain Institute, a private energy analysis group, and an advocate of energy efficiency.</p>
        <p>The institute has calculated that the country's biggest new source of energy since the 1970's has been energy saved through efficiency gains -- not gleaned through a new oil well or mine.</p>
        <p>Administration officials say that new production is essential. Without the new legislation, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said on Friday, ''We can't do the sorts of things that we've been talking about to transform our energy dependency into a situation in which America has abundant natural reserves of energy here at home.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nadel believes conservation as a national policy will not arrive until it costs too much to avoid it.</p>
        <p>''If we truly have an energy squeeze like we did in the 1970's, then it's possible to get a decent energy policy,'' Mr. Nadel said. ''Until then, no one wants to sacrifice their S.U.V.'s or tax breaks for the folks back home and most votes will tend to be on parochial interests rather than the big picture.''</p>
        <p>No Crisis, No Bill?  Correction:  November 30, 2003, Sunday  An article last Sunday about federal energy legislation misstated a provision for uranium enrichment projects. The bill would have streamlined regulations for a plant proposed for New Mexico and shifted responsibility for its waste to the federal government, but did not authorize any federal money for it.</p>
