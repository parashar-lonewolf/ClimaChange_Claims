        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>One hundred million people ago, when the population was 200 million, a commission proposed by President Nixon in 1969 (inspired by Daniel Patrick Moynihan) reached a very different assessment of our population numbers than the unalloyed enthusiasm of your Oct. 11 editorial ''300 Million.''</p>
        <p>The Commission on Population Growth and the American Future enacted by Congress consisted of 24 members appointed by the White House. John D. Rockefeller 3rd was the chairman. It met for two years (1970-72) to evaluate the pros and cons of future growth of America's population, based on five volumes of research commissioned by the panel. I was its executive director.</p>
        <p>The main focus of its report was the implications of continued growth for the economy, the environment, for governance and various social concerns. High levels of unwanted births (still estimated today at 14 percent of all births) and illegal immigration (trivial by today's numbers), which it opposed, were two of its concerns. Its main conclusion was that the stabilization of population would be advantageous on every count.</p>
        <p>The image that 35 years later we would be celebrating 300 million, let alone the 400 million expected in a few more decades, was never on the drawing board.</p>
        <p>Charles F. Westoff  Princeton, N.J., Oct. 11, 2006</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Dismissing current concerns about America's rapid population growth chiefly as fears of right-wing xenophobes and alarmists ignores polling data indicating that a majority of Americans, faced with increasingly crowded cities, suburban sprawl, mounting traffic jams and growing environmental concerns, do not want further population growth.</p>
        <p>While the United States benefits in certain respects from immigration and population growth, and as the United States population would still be growing even if immigration were significantly reduced, the benefits of immigration must be weighed against these concerns, which are shared by Americans of many political views and backgrounds.</p>
        <p>Christopher S. Edwards  New York, Oct. 12, 2006</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I agree wholeheartedly with your editorial criticizing Patrick Buchanan's fear-mongering regarding immigration. But your statement that ''our population issues have mysterious ways of working themselves out'' is a dangerous oversimplification.</p>
        <p>It can't be denied that many of the predictions of the 1968 book ''The Population Bomb'' have been disproved with the passage of time. Its author, Paul R. Ehrlich, certainly didn't foresee surprising developments like declining populations in some technologically advanced nations.</p>
        <p>But it is also true that most of the serious problems facing humankind are exacerbated or directly caused by exponential population growth. These range from dire environmental degradation to increased human misery from causes such as severe water shortages and, yes, famine.</p>
        <p>Immigration into the United States is a social issue that is best viewed from the perspective of the history of this nation. Global population growth, however, is taking us into distinctly uncharted territory. It is certainly premature to assume that things will ''work themselves out.''</p>
        <p>Larry Geni  Evanston, Ill., Oct. 11, 2006</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Beyond whatever celebrations may accompany the United States' population hitting 300 million, there are some facts worth pondering about this accidental milestone.</p>
        <p>Fully 35 percent of all United States births are unplanned. We still have the highest teenage pregnancy rates in the developed world. And we have laws that promote abstinence-only programs that masquerade as sex education and allow pharmacists in some states to refuse to fill birth control prescriptions.</p>
        <p>Maybe we should stow our party hats and put on our thinking caps instead to start planning for a less crowded future.</p>
        <p>John Seager  Washington, Oct. 12, 2006</p>
        <p>The writer is president of Population Connection (formerly Zero Population Growth).</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your editorial celebrating the 300 millionth American could not be more shortsighted. ''The Population Bomb'' may now be found in garage sales, but its basic premise is as valid today as it was in 1968: environmental impact = population x consumption x technology. This equation demonstrates the simple fact that each American will have far more impact on the world and its resources than will, say, the average Ethiopian.</p>
        <p>Population growth exacerbates all the problems associated with global warming. I'm afraid we will need to find something other than our ''teeming immensity'' to keep us from growing ''stale.''</p>
        <p>Christopher Wood  Cleveland Heights, Ohio  Oct. 11, 2006</p>
