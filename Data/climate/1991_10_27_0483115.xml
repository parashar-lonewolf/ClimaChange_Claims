        <p>Scientists from 25 countries had a serious message last week for lovers of the summer sun in North America, Europe and the rest of the temperate zone: The sun's summertime rays are even more hazardous than had been thought.</p>
        <p>Eighty experts convened by the United Nations said they had found, for the first time, that the earth's protective ozone shield has been significantly weakened over the mid-latitudes in summer, when harmful ultraviolet rays are strongest and therefore most dangerous. The ozone layer blocks those rays, which can cause cancer and eye cataracts and damage some plants.</p>
        <p>Concern about the ozone shield burst forth in the mid-1980's, when scientists detected a wintertime "hole" in it over the South Pole, and substantial weakness in the layer over the North Pole in winter. To blame were ozone-destroying chemicals, chiefly chlorofluorocarbons, used in refrigeration and air conditioning.</p>
        <p>And last April, the Environmental Protection Administration reported that over the previous decade, the part of the ozone layer over the temperate zones in the winter and early spring had been depleted by 4.5 to 5 percent. The E.P.A. calculated that this would cause 12 million more Americans to develop skin cancer in the next 50 years, with 200,000 fatalities, than if there were no ozone depletion. The previous forecast was for 500,000 new cancer cases with 93,000 fatalities over the same period.</p>
        <p>Now, on the basis of new data from satellites and ground stations, scientists have concluded that in the 1980's, the ozone layer over the mid-latitudes in summer was depleted by about 3 percent in the Northern Hemisphere, and by about 5 percent in the Southern. They said the higher rate -- roughly triple that of the 1970's --was expected to persist through the 1990's.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, previous advice on exposure to summer sun seems to go double: Cover up when outside. Wear a hat, long sleeves, sunglasses and sunblock. And stay in the shade when possible.</p>
