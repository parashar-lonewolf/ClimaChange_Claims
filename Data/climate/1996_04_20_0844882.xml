        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As evidenced by recent Business Day articles (April 11 and 17), consumers are facing steadily increasing gasoline prices as a result of rapidly increasing demand. This textbook supply-and-demand relationship is being worsened by omissions and commissions perpetrated in Washington that are letting energy demand soar and pushing prices up.</p>
        <p>For example, we expect legislation that was enacted last year to increase the national speed limit to result in heightened demand of seven million gallons a day, costing more than $3 billion annually and increasing oil imports by 10 percent.</p>
        <p>A new proposal to vitiate the executive branch's ability to raise Federal fuel-economy standards will, in our view, cut down the nation's most successful  oil-demand reduction effort. These standards have already saved the typical buyer of a new car an average of $3,300 at the gas pump over the life of the car and lessened the country's oil demand by three million barrels a day.</p>
        <p>Congress has refused full financing of a research effort between the Federal  Government and automakers that is intended to triple fuel efficiency performance. Meantime, the Federal budget for operating assistance for mass transit was hit: the President proposed a 37 percent cut and Congress approved a 50 percent cut.</p>
        <p>In the past year, Congress has cut the Administration's request for energy efficiency and alternative energy sources by one-third, leading to delays in bringing about new technologies and applications that will help lessen demand for gasoline, heating oil and other fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>As long as demand for gasoline and other finite energy sources keeps going up faster than supplies, price increases for drivers will stay in the fast lane.</p>
        <p>DAVID M. NEMTZOW Washington, April 17, 1996</p>
        <p>President, Alliance to Save Energy</p>
