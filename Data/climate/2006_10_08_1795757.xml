        <p>WHEN Starbucks agreed to introduce a coffee liqueur with Jim Beam last year, Pax World Funds had no choice but to sell its $23 million Starbucks stake.

        <p>WHEN Starbucks agreed to introduce a coffee liqueur with Jim Beam last year, Pax World Funds had no choice but to sell its $23 million Starbucks stake. Pax World says it engages in socially responsible investing, and its rules have barred investments in companies that derive revenue from liquor. So Pax World divested, even though it has long considered Starbucks strong on social responsibility and the Jim Beam deal was small potatoes for the coffee chain.</p>
        <p>But last month, shareholders in two funds, Pax World Growth and Pax World High-Yield, decided that it was time for the company to shed its zero-tolerance policy on alcohol and gambling. At the behest of Pax World's management, they approved more flexible guidelines that will allow fund managers to drop those traditional strict ''sin screens'' and place greater emphasis on corporate governance, climate change and other contemporary issues. The same changes were put before shareholders of the larger Pax World Balanced fund, but its balloting was extended to Oct. 26.</p>
        <p>The changes at Pax World illustrate the challenges faced by funds that say they are devoted to socially responsible investing. When the earliest of these funds began screening companies for ethical and political concerns more than 30 years ago, big issues included the war in Vietnam and apartheid in South Africa. A strong aversion to American military actions resulted in many such funds shunning not just arms makers but even Treasury securities, on the ground that money lent to Uncle Sam might well be used for armaments.</p>
        <p>Even now, for example, Pax World Balanced invests in government agency securities like bonds issued by the Student Loan Marketing Association, but not in conventional Treasury bonds. (Pax World declined to comment for this article, citing its pending proxy statement.)</p>
        <p>Whatever their focus, interest has been growing in funds that describe themselves as socially responsible. The Social Investment Forum, a trade group, says that assets in ''socially screened mutual funds and other pooled products'' reached $179 billion in 2005, up from $12 billion in 1995.</p>
        <p>Pax World isn't the only fund family of its type scrambling to keep up with changing times. The Calvert Group, for example, recently eliminated a policy barring investment in companies deriving more than 10 percent of revenue from the arms business. Calvert will still assess a company's involvement in armaments, but with more flexibility, so that a business making armor plating for peacekeeping forces, for instance, is not automatically excluded.</p>
        <p>''We have to work hard every day to keep abreast of new issues and new trends and new standards,'' said Bennett Freeman, senior vice president for social research and policy at Calvert. When Calvert's earliest funds started in 1982, global warming was not on the radar. But today, Mr. Freeman said, ''there is no single environmental issue that we work on more frequently now than climate change.''</p>
        <p>Calvert has been active, for example, in efforts to persuade corporations to disclose their annual carbon emissions.</p>
        <p>Timothy H. Smith, president of the Social Investing Forum, said some mutual funds had gone beyond merely weeding out companies in what they consider the wrong lines of business. Now, he said, their money managers are more active, pressing corporate managements on governance, diversity and climate change. They do so by meeting with managements, proposing shareholder resolutions and voting their proxies. In contrast with the old days, Mr. Smith said, ''screening is no longer the leadership activity of socially responsible investors.''</p>
        <p>For example, the Boston-based Walden Asset Management, where Mr. Smith is a senior vice president, was co-sponsor of a shareholder resolution asking Home Depot to provide a report on its record of employing women and minorities. He said the vote was 35 percent in favor, a significant proportion for a shareholder resolution. Mr. Smith says Walden plans to take up the issue again in discussions with management.</p>
        <p>''The vote is a sign that investors understand an issue like diversity can affect shareowner value,'' he said in an e-mail message.</p>
        <p>That kind of shareholder engagement is one justification for holding some less-than-perfect companies in a socially responsible portfolio. The idea is that owning shares makes it easier to press for improvements. ''There is no such thing as a pure portfolio,'' Mr. Smith said. ''That's a fantasy.''</p>
        <p>The persistence of bans on alcohol shares -- as opposed to shares in fast-food and sugary-drink companies -- underscores the difficulties for funds in selecting portfolios that will be viewed as socially responsible by a consensus of investors. Consider the Domini 400 Social Index, the standard benchmark for many funds that call themselves socially responsible.</p>
        <p>KLD Research and Analytics, which created and maintains the Domini 400, excludes tobacco companies, arms makers and casino operators, yet the index contains names that may surprise some investors.</p>
        <p>The Domini 400 excludes makers of wine or beer, but it includes McDonald's, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola, although critics of those companies contend that their products have an impact on the nation's waistline. And a brochure for the Domini Social Equity fund, which tracks the index, says the Domini 400 is underweighted in the health care sector, ''in large part because of price and safety controversies in the pharmaceutical industry.''</p>
        <p>Also included in the index are the Janus Capital Group, which in 2004 agreed to a $225 million settlement with regulators over accusations of improper trading in its funds; Microsoft, which has faced legal assault and criticism arising from antitrust questions over the years; and Hewlett-Packard, whose chairwoman, Patricia C. Dunn, resigned amid a controversy over how H.P. obtained phone records of company directors and journalists during an investigation of boardroom leaks.</p>
        <p>Karin Chamberlain, manager of indexes at KLD, and Eric Fernald, director of research, said the Domini 400 should be seen in light of its aim, which is to be socially responsible while providing a broadly diversified portfolio with low turnover. Thus, some companies in the index help provide exposure to broad market sectors. So while it's hard for a company to make the list, the index's goal of low turnover means it may also be somewhat difficult to be thrown off.</p>
        <p>Merck remains on the list despite legal troubles over its Vioxx painkiller. Ms. Chamberlain and Mr. Fernald said that Merck has a good record for social responsibility aside from the Vioxx episode, and that even in that instance Merck withdrew its own product.</p>
        <p>''There's no such thing as a perfect company,'' said Peter Kinder, president of KLD, who readily acknowledges enjoying a little bourbon now and then. ''Socially responsible investors are willing to deal in grays.''</p>
