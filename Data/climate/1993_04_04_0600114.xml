      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>As humans turned to agriculture, they converted large tracts of woodland and jungle into farmland and grazing areas. Soon trees were being harvested for fuel and building materials, and later to produce pulp for paper and other print products. Most of us, however, know little about the forests and jungles that cover 37 percent of Earth's land surface. Check your forest knowledge quotient here.</p>
        <p>(Answers on Page 12.)</p>
        <p>1. The concept of forest conservation originated in the United States in the early 20th century. True or False?</p>
        <p>2. In 1944 the United States Forest Service instituted a publicity campaign to prevent forest fires that featured what animal?</p>
        <p>3. Most forest fires are caused by humans. What is the next-largest cause of forest fires?</p>
        <p>4. What is the difference between a surface forest fire and a crown fire?</p>
        <p>5. Is it in the interest of conservation to fight all forest fires?</p>
        <p>6. During the growing season, typically spring and summer, the amount of water that evaporates from the leaves of an acre of birch and maple forest per day is (a) 250 gallons; (b) 8,000 gallons; (c) 10,000 gallons.</p>
        <p>7. What is a conifer?</p>
        <p>8. In what way do deciduous trees benefit by losing their leaves?</p>
        <p>9. The following trees, with the exception of one, belong to the same family. What is the name of the family and which tree is the exception? Redwood, cypress, oak, cedar, hemlock.</p>
        <p>10. Which of the following describe the ecological benefits of forests? (a) They absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen into the atmosphere; (b) They prevent soil erosion and subsequent flooding from unchecked runoff of rainwater; (c) Rainwater is filtered in the soil, providing a fresh source of ground water for streams, lakes and wells.</p>
        <p>11. Where are tropical rain forests found?</p>
        <p>12. Silviculture is (a) the study of forestry; (b) the study of the effects of forests on human culture; (c) tree farming.</p>
        <p>13. Describe the major differences between a jungle and a rain forest.</p>
        <p>14. What estimated percentage of Earth's plant and animal species is found in rain forests? (a) 14 percent; (b) 50 percent; (c) 75 percent.</p>
        <p>15. Match the following trees with the type of forest in which they are found: teak, oak, Douglas fir, cypress; temperate Northern Hemisphere forest, tropical rain forest, temperate deciduous broad-leafed forest, Southern coniferous forest.</p>
        <p>16. Heliotropism is (a) the storing of carbon in a tree; (b) the leaves turning color in the fall; (c) the tendency of trees to bend toward light.</p>
        <p>17. What gas is absorbed by trees and released when trees burn?</p>
        <p>18. At the present rate of logging and deforestation of tropical rain forests, scientists estimate the time it will take to destroy these forests to be: (a) 50 years; (b) 100 years; (c) 500 years.</p>
        <p>19. Match the following forests with their locations: Ouachita National Forest, Tongass National Forest, Petrified Forest, Black Forest; Alaska, Arizona, Germany, Arkansas.</p>
