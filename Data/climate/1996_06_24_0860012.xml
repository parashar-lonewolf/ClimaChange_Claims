        <p>TASTIER fruit that can be shipped greater distances is the goal of three professors of food science who have patented a system for that purpose.</p>
        <p>The problem is that peaches are chill-sensitive," Donald Schlimme, who teaches at the University of Maryland, said. "If they are kept at 32 degrees Fahrenheit more than 10 to 14 days, they become very mealy and suffer internal breakdown."</p>
        <p>"Chill sensitivity has impeded worldwide consumption of peaches for decades," Professor Schlimme said. "The per capita consumption of peaches is not increasing even though fruit consumption in general is going up every year."</p>
        <p>Other beneficiaries, he said, would be nectarines and plums.</p>
        <p>The patent covers fives steps.</p>
        <p>The first step is to pick the peaches as they approach maturity, before they  start manufacturing ethylene, which initiates the ripening process. "In peaches  as in many fruit, ripening is simultaneous to the production of ethylene," Professor Schlimme said. "Once ripening starts you can't stop it."</p>
        <p>The second step is to dip the fruits in a diluted solution of chlorine and citric acid to deter microbial growth. Most peaches sold at the supermarket have been treated similarly, Professor Schlimme said. The fruit is then stored at 32  degrees for a short time until it is ready to be shipped.</p>
        <p>The third step is to keep the peaches, while shipped, in hermetically sealed  containers with an oxygen content of about 2 percent and a carbon dioxide content of about 10 percent. The temperature of the containers is raised to about 50 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
        <p>"The low oxygen and high carbon dioxide impede the onset of ethylene production, which makes the fruit vulnerable to chill injury," Professor Schlimme said.</p>
        <p>The fourth step takes place once the peaches have arrived at their general destination. "They are removed from their containers and then gassed with ethylene from four to 24 hours," Professor Schlimme said. "This promotes ripening."</p>
        <p>Then the peaches are cooled to 32 degrees Fahrenheit until they are ready to  be sold.</p>
        <p>Professor Schlimme said that in laboratory experiments the peaches survived 10 weeks and that the system would be field-tested in August with a late harvest of peaches in California.</p>
        <p>"You get adequate peach aroma and adequate peach flavor," Professor Schlimme  said. "It's not as good as if you picked the peach ripe and ate it as you stood  under the fruit tree. This system doesn't make peaches perfect. It makes them superior to what we're getting now at the market and it enables us to ship them  worldwide."</p>
        <p>Mr. Schlimme, Christopher S. Walsh, and Luis E. Luchsinger received patent 5,516,539.</p>
        <p>3-D Sound On a Shoestring</p>
        <p>The complex structure of the human ear allows us not only to hear sounds but  to know where they are coming from. Against the noisy background buzz of a cocktail party, for example, one might hear a familiar voice and know without looking that the person it belongs to is standing near the shrimp platter.</p>
        <p>Such three-dimensional sound normally can be replicated in real time only on  computers that have expensive digital signal processors with enough horsepower to make the necessary calculations.</p>
        <p>But Louis Gehring, a pioneer in the field of computer graphics, said he has patented a technique for delivering 3-D sound inexpensively.</p>
        <p>"Where I predict the explosive use is in computer games," Mr. Gehring said. "It will be used for the predictable zaps and explosions but also for sounds like live animals moving about in the wild. Let's say you're being chased by a monster through the woods. It will sound as if the monster is right behind you."</p>
        <p>The patent covers two separate sets of algorithms. The first processes a sound file with 3-D information. Then a second set of algorithms positions the sounds in real time.</p>
        <p>"There are tricks in the industry like panning or doppler shifting or reverb, but this is the only technology that can move a sound anywhere in a 360-degree sphere without costly digital signal processing," said Paul Paray, Mr. Gehring's patent lawyer, who is based in Glen Rock, N.J.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gehring, who hopes to license his invention, received patent 5,521,981.</p>
        <p>Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and Trademark Office,  Washington, D.C. 20231.</p>
