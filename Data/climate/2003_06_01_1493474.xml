        <p>But since becoming chief executive in October 2001 and having to struggle to right a company that lost $6.4 billion in 2001 and 2002, Mr. Ford has been accused of not living up to his words.

Now several groups plan protests to coincide with Ford's centennial celebration at its annual meeting this month.</p>
        <p>''I would be lying to you if I said I wasn't kind of hurt by it, because to be singled out, when for many years I felt I was a lone voice in the wilderness, surprised me,'' Mr. Ford said at a briefing for analysts last week.</p>
        <p>''I have put a lot of myself on the line over the years for this issue and will continue to in the future,'' he said. ''But there have been some business realities I've had to judge over the last couple years where we've had to make some choices.''</p>
