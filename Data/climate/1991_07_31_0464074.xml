        <p>A GROWING number of American women are undergoing a nonsurgical procedure to destroy the lining of the uterus as an alternative to hysterectomy.</p>
        <p>The method, called endometrial ablation, also eliminates monthly periods and makes the womb inhospitable to newly fertilized eggs, and some women are using it as a form of permanent birth control, according to doctors who perform the procedure. It was developed as a nonsurgical alternative to hysterectomies in women who suffer from excessive uterine bleeding.</p>
        <p>Endometrial ablation "is catching on," said Dr. Jordan M. Phillips, chairman of the board of the American Association of Gynecological Laparoscopists in Santa Fe Springs, Calif. "Patients are hearing about it from other patients," he said. "Many doctors are doing it for women who no longer want to have periods. It's very logical."  Questions About</p>
        <p>But Dr. Alan H. DeCherney, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Yale University, warned that endometrial ablation is an untested method of birth control. "It's probably pretty good" for preventing pregnancy he said, but the long-term safety of the method has not been proven.</p>
        <p>For example, Dr. DeCherney said he worries that small "islands" of endometrial tissue might be left in the uterus. If these became cancerous, he said, the woman might not experience bleeding, which is the most reliable warning sign of uterine cancer.</p>
        <p>In addition, as many as 10 pregnancies may have occurred, according to doctors who are tracking the procedure.</p>
        <p>Each year more than a million women visit their doctors complaining of heavy, irregular menstrual periods, according to the American College of Obstretrics and Gynecology.</p>
        <p>Regular menstruation depends on the monthly development of a healthy layer of uterine tissue, called the endometrium, and cyclical production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen, released in the first half of the cycle, thickens the endometrium and readies it to nurture a fertilized egg. If conception does not take place after ovulation, progesterone is released in the second half of the cycle, thinning the endometrium and prompting it to shed.</p>
        <p>The most common cause of excessive uterine bleeding is the failure to ovulate, Dr. DeCherney said. Then the woman's body does not produce progesterone and her endometrium keeps on thickening, he said, until it bleeds spontaneously and heavily. The condition often responds to hormones that restore a natural balance between estrogen and progesterone.</p>
        <p>But hormone therapy fails to help 15 percent to 20 percent of the women, Dr. DeCherney said. Some of them have physical abnormalities inside the uterus like benign tumors called fibroids and polyps or endometriosis, a condition in which fragments of the endometrium are found in the pelvic cavity, outside of the uterus.</p>
        <p>Although endometriosis can cause excessive bleeding, Dr. DeCherney said, it is not treated with endometrial ablation because it occurs in splotches outside the uterus.</p>
        <p>Heavy bleeding that does not respond to drug therapy is routinely treated with hysterectomies, Dr. DeCherney said. In 1989, about 541,000 hysterectomies were performed, the majority of them for heavy uterine bleeding, according to A.C.O.G. As many as half of these operations may have been treatable using nonsurgical procedures, some doctors say.</p>
        <p>Three or four years ago, Dr. DeCherney said, gynecologists realized they could use an endoscope, a tubelike instrument with lenses and a light source attached, to see the insides of the uterus, determine the problem and then correct the problem without major surgery.</p>
        <p>The ultrathin instrument, called a hysteroscope, is inserted through the cervix in a procedure that does not require anesthesia and can be performed in a doctor's office. The uterus, which is normally collapsed in on itself, is inflated with a liquid or with carbon dioxide gas.</p>
        <p>"We get a panoramic view inside" the uterus, said Dr. DeCherney.</p>
        <p>If it is cancer, the uterus and possibly the ovaries are removed. If it is fibroids, drugs are given for several months to shrink the growths. Then the doctor re-enters the uterus with a hysteroscope and cutting tool and removes the fibroids. Polyps are similarly removed.</p>
        <p>If there are no growths and the woman no longer wants to bear children, the endometrium is cauterized with an electrical wire or laser beam.  No Incisions</p>
        <p>Such treatments require general anesthesia or a spinal block and must be administered in a hospital, said Dr. Benjamin Gocial, a gynecologist at the Philadelphia Fertility Clinic. But patients can go home the same day; there are no incisions and no scars.</p>
        <p>Women go back to work the next day, Dr. Gocial said. They may feel sore for one or two weeks, he added, but they are not in great pain.</p>
        <p>Recently, women who do not have bleeding problems have begun asking their doctors to perform endometrial ablations to stop their periods, Dr. Phillips said. Many are in their early 40's and do not want more children, he said.</p>
        <p>Most private doctors who perform endometrial ablations have no qualms about helping such patients, Dr. Phillips said. It is considered a "social indication" rather than a medical indication for the treatment.</p>
        <p>"We can't guarantee it will do away with periods," Dr. Phillips said. "But most of the time, there is not enough endometrium left to support a pregnancy." He said, however, that he had personally heard of about 8 to 10 pregnancies afterward.</p>
        <p>For unknown reasons the endometrium regenerates in part in a substantial number of women who have undergone the procedure, Dr. DeCherney said. A study published in a recent issue of The Lancet, a British medical journal, found that 50 percent of patients had reduced menstrual flow, 30 percent had no flow and 20 percent had no change.</p>
        <p>Many patients need to be treated more than once to eliminate their periods completely, Dr. DeCherney said.</p>
        <p>Many gynecologists have not yet learned how to use hysteroscopes, Dr. DeCherney said. "They're used to hysterectomies where the results are reproducible," he said, and see no reason to substitute a new therapy.</p>
        <p>But as women demand alternatives to hysterectomies, Dr. Phillips said, more doctors are signing up for training courses in the new techniques.</p>
