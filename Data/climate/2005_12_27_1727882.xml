        <p>Promising but With Problems</p>
        <p>As the world produces more of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, scientists are looking for ways to get rid of it. The idea is to create a ''sink,'' a means of storing the gas that will sequester it from the atmosphere permanently.</p>
        <p>While there are many proposals of how to do this (including underground or ocean storage), perhaps the most promising sink is a natural one, a tree.</p>
        <p>The idea is simple: plant large expanses of fast-growing trees, which will take in carbon dioxide and, through photosynthesis, convert it into the tissues that make trunks, branches, leaves and roots.</p>
        <p>But trees also use a lot of water and nutrients.</p>
        <p>So while they may help solve one problem, they can create others, according to a study in the current issue of the journal Science.</p>
        <p>The research, by Robert B. Jackson of Duke University and colleagues, combined field data from existing tree plantations around the world and computer modeling to gauge the effect of plantations on stream flows and soil.</p>
        <p>The study also looked at whether plantations would have enough of an effect on climate to offset any water-related problems, by producing more rainfall, for example.</p>
        <p>The researchers found that by cutting runoff, plantations reduced stream flows within several years of planting, and that the reductions generally increased with time.</p>
        <p>Plantations that were 10 to 20 years old, for example, cut flows annually by more than half. In about 13 percent of cases, streams dried up completely for a year or more. Salinity and acidification of soils increased, as well.</p>
        <p>Trees also pump a lot of water vapor into the atmosphere. Modeling the effects of large-scale tree planting on climate revealed, however, that in most areas this would not result in more rain. In some cases, the researchers found, widespread tree plantations could actually result in less rainfall, making the stream-flow problem even worse.</p>
        <p>Valve Job</p>
        <p>All the water that trees use circulates through their tissues by means of strawlike cellular structures that serve as a plumbing system. The system is different depending upon the type of tree. Angiosperms, the flowering trees, have relatively long straws, while conifers have much shorter ones.</p>
        <p>In both cases, there are valvelike structures at the ends, where the straws meet. Since conifers have so many valves, it might be expected that water would encounter more resistance and circulate less efficiently in them. Yet the tallest and longest-living trees are conifers, so obviously their water-transport system works well.</p>
        <p>A report in the current issue of Science by Jarmila Pittermann and colleagues at the University of Utah shows why. The valves in conifers, specialized structures called torus-margo pits, offer far less resistance to water than the valves in angiosperms. The lower resistance compensates for the fact that there are so many more valves than in angiosperms.</p>
        <p>One function of the valves is to keep air out of the plumbing. In angiosperms, the valves do this by having very tiny pores, so that the capillary force of water keeps the air out. The torus-margo pits in conifers, however, have a larger structure (the torus) that plugs up the valve against air.</p>
        <p>The actual pores are much larger than those in angiosperms, so they let the water through more efficiently. If conifers had valves like those of the angiosperms, their water resistance would increase 38-fold, the researchers said.</p>
        <p>A Holiday Bonus</p>
        <p>In case you haven't noticed, the earth has been slowing down of late. So much so, in fact, that the people in charge of keeping time standardized have decided to add a second on New Year's Eve.</p>
        <p>The extra second, the first in seven years, will be added just before midnight Greenwich Mean Time (7 p.m. in New York).</p>
        <p>The added time helps keep the earth in tune with the world's atomic clocks, which are far more consistent than the planet's rotation.</p>
        <p>Napoleon's Flaw: Lousy Army</p>
        <p>The 1812 invasion of Russia by Napoleon's Grand Army ranks as one of the worst military fiascoes of all time. Of half a million soldiers sent toward Moscow, only about 5 percent made it back.</p>
        <p>While some were killed at Borodino and other battles, many died of hunger, disease and exposure, especially in the cold and snow of the retreat.</p>
        <p>Because many soldiers died of fever, and because they were known to be infested with body lice (as described by Tolstoy in ''War and Peace,'' among other sources) it has long been suggested that the troops suffered from lice-borne diseases like trench fever and typhus.</p>
        <p>Now, researchers at the University of the Mediterranean in Marseille, France, have produced solid evidence that lice were the culprits. Analyzing soil and the remains of dental tissue from a mass grave of Napoleon's troops uncovered several years ago in Vilnius, Lithuania, the researchers found both remnants of body lice and DNA of the disease-causing bacteria they carry.</p>
        <p>''We were able to identify things that have the same size and appearance as louse remnants,'' said Dr. Didier Raoult, lead author of a paper describing the finding published in The Journal of Infectious Diseases. ''To show that they were really lice, we identified them genetically.''</p>
        <p>Remnants of five lice were found in about 2 1/2 pounds of soil, Dr. Raoult said, and three of them were carrying the bacteria that causes trench fever. Dental tissue from 35 soldiers was tested; seven were found to have trench fever bacteria, and three had the bacteria that cause typhus.</p>
        <p>The findings suggest that roughly one-third of the 3,000 soldiers found in the mass grave were killed by lice-borne disease. ''They were very sick and they had this in their blood,'' Dr. Raoult said. ''They weren't killed by weapons.''</p>
