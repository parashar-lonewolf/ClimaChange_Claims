        <p>WILD Atlantic salmon returning to spawn in the freshwater streams of their birth now face a startling threat: interlopers.</p>
        <p>New research shows that more than a quarter of the spawning salmon in Norwegian rivers and streams are escapees from fish farms -- fish hatched in metal tanks, vaccinated against infections and raised in sea pens artificially lighted to speed maturation. In several rivers, the ratio of escaped farm fish to wild salmon is four to one.</p>
        <p>Geneticists warn that without stiffer controls, the rapidly growing aquaculture industry in Europe and North America could wipe out what is left of the wild Atlantic salmon population.</p>
        <p>Lars Petter Hansen, a scientist at the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research who did the research, said, ''The heavy numbers of escaped farm fish make us believe that the genetic constitution of wild stocks will change so that they will be less adapted to their local habitats.''</p>
        <p>Norwegian fish farmers expect to produce 330,000 tons of salmon this year. The genes of the farm stock, after five generations of artificial selection, favor fast growth and a high fat content. By comparison, the entire catch of wild salmon in the Atlantic Ocean in 1995 was 3,800 tons, down from 14,000 tons in 1973.</p>
        <p>Norway's Atlantic salmon farmers account for half the world's production of such fish; Norway's output is more than three times as much as that of its nearest competitor, Britain. Norwegian aquaculture enthusiasts hope for continued growth, but salmon prices have already plunged, and the European Union is considering sanctions against Norway for flooding the market.</p>
        <p>An estimated 200,000 to 650,000 individual salmon escaped from Norwegian fish farms in 1995. That is less than 1 percent of the captive population but is nonetheless ''a lot of fish,'' said Rune Bildeng, a special adviser to the Ministry of Fisheries. Finding the negligent fish farmers can be a hopeless task. In the Saltdals Fjord, near the city of Bodoe, 90 percent of the salmon netted over several weeks last summer were identified as farmed fish, but the authorities failed to find the source.</p>
        <p>Most of the strays get out when storms or seals damage their floating sea pens. Other escapes are attributed to damage from boat propellers, vandalism, poor maintenance and accidents during fish transfers and sorting. In a series of storms in 1990, Mr. Bildeng said, some four million salmon burst from their pens along the Norwegian coast. Another large breakout occurred during a hurricane in 1992.</p>
        <p>In recent years, the Norwegian authorities have stepped up the regulation and inspection of the 700 fish farms in the west coast fjords. But while environmental conditions, particularly the amount of pollution generated by the farms, have improved, the number of escapees remains unacceptably high by most accounts. Fish-pen manufacturers are working on more storm-resistant designs, but indestructibility is an elusive goal. Environmentalists and sport anglers are demanding that production be cut and are threatening to boycott farmed salmon.</p>
        <p>''The unchecked growth of the salmon farming industry is a national scandal,'' Borre Pettersen, head of the Norwegian Association of Hunters and Anglers, said: ''It's a national scandal how the salmon farming industry has been allowed to grow so explosively. The wild Norwegian salmon could well be lost forever.''</p>
        <p>The fish farmers' association admits that wild salmon strains are threatened by the strays, but it insists that dams and acid rain are more serious threats.</p>
        <p>Wild salmon have an impressive homing instinct that lets them find their native streams after spending a lifetime at sea. Fish-farm strays, by contrast, seem to dart up whatever stream is nearest when the urge to spawn strikes. They are less successful at reproduction than their wild cousins, but researchers say there is little doubt that crossbreeding is taking place. Since wild Atlantic salmon are genetically different from one river to the next, the fear is that crossbreeding with strays will erase the river-specific characteristics necessary for long-term survival.</p>
        <p>In addition, plump strays that fail to leap salmon ladders often block the route for wild fish by crowding the water just downstream. The strays that do spawn get to the spawning grounds late, sometimes destroying the already established nests of natives in the commotion. They also carry parasites like sea lice, and even though they are vaccinated against many pathogenic bacteria and viruses, they can still be carriers of disease.</p>
        <p>On the other side of the ocean, wild Atlantic salmon are almost extinct in American rivers. While casual observers may rejoice at the sight of a few big fish in the rivers of eastern Maine, a disappointingly high proportion are fish-farm strays, said Chris Mantzaris, division chief for the National Marine Fisheries Service. ''The farmed fish just don't have the sleekness and sparkle that the wild fish have,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Canadian and American research into fish-farm escapes remains preliminary, but the Magaguadavic River in New Brunswick has become a sort of scientific fishbowl for studying the effects of intermingling wild and domesticated fish. The Atlantic Salmon Federation reported that  DNA studies comparing today's wild salmon in the river with specimens preserved from the 1970's showed there had been an unwelcome crossbreeding with farm strays.</p>
        <p>Various Pacific salmon species are cultivated on a large scale, but American fish farmers produce only about 19,000 tons of Atlantic salmon annually, about 6 percent of Norwegian production.</p>
