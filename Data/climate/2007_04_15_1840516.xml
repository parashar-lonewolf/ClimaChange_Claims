        <p>Around 8:30 p.m., a fat gray bus bound for Atlantic City pulls up on Division Street in Chinatown.

        <p>Around 8:30 p.m., a fat gray bus bound for Atlantic City pulls up on Division Street in Chinatown. Its doors wheeze open, and a line of riders shuffle into formation, clutching pink tickets and plastic shopping bags, and sucking a few final drags from their cigarettes before flicking them away.</p>
        <p>The ritual takes no more than 15 minutes, but it happens dozens of times a day as buses headed to Trump Plaza, Foxwoods or other casinos load and unload passengers in the V formed by the Bowery and Division Street.</p>
        <p>Now, citing pollution and noise, neighbors say they want the buses to find a new home.</p>
        <p>''You can feel a toxic film in our yard,'' said Justin Yu, vice president of the co-op board at Confucius Plaza, a 44-story complex that overlooks the site. ''It's very unhealthy.''</p>
        <p>While numerous bus companies operate out of Chinatown, Mr. Yu and his neighbors are particularly concerned about casino buses because their informal hub is a block shared by hundreds of senior citizens, an elementary school, a kindergarten and a day care center.</p>
        <p>And unlike the commuter buses that travel to and from Boston or Philadelphia, he said, they offer little public benefit.</p>
        <p>''Casino buses take money out of the community,'' Mr. Yu said, and attract an ''undesirable element.''</p>
        <p>Alice Hom, principal of Public School 124, which abuts the site, said the bus users often litter or urinate on the street. Teachers complain about fumes seeping into their classrooms.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday afternoon, fifth graders in the P.S. 124 after-school program sat in clusters on the floor, drawing pictures of buses spewing curls of Magic Marker smoke, to be displayed at a community board meeting that night.</p>
        <p>''The exhaust pollutes the air, which causes serious damage to the ozone layer,'' said Andrea Ting, a 10-year-old wearing black nail polish and polka-dot arm warmers. ''It's really a problem.''</p>
        <p>May Chow, a resident of Confucius Plaza who has operated Chinatown casino buses since 1979, sighed when she heard about the drawings. The children are ''being used,'' she said, adding, ''They're being brainwashed.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Chow, who runs eight buses a day from Division Street to Caesars Atlantic City, acknowledges that her drivers sometimes double-park but says they never idle their engines.</p>
        <p>Though she has agreed to consider alternate locations, she says she is reluctant to move from a spot her customers know and trust.</p>
        <p>Ms. Chow and 16 other casino bus operators recently formed a coalition and hired a lawyer, Steven Friedberg, who at the community board meeting described his clients as responsible citizens willing to police themselves.</p>
        <p>The audience seemed unconvinced. After speeches from neighbors and parents, Lolita Jackson, Manhattan director of the Mayor's Community Assistance Unit, announced plans for a multidepartment meeting this week on how to better regulate Chinatown transportation.</p>
        <p>Speaking last, Ms. Chow stood firm. ''I'm not going to argue with what was said in this room,'' she said. ''Nobody likes buses. But this is city life.''</p>
