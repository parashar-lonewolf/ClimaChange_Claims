        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Supercritical carbon dioxide holds the promise of creating new materials, ("Rethinking Plastics From the Ground Up," Technology, Sept. 11), but most of the environmental benefits claimed for this new technology have been with us for a while. More than 20 years ago, Union Carbide developed a proprietary process for making polyethylene, the most widely used plastic, that uses no solvents and has very low emissions, much like the process using supercritical carbon dioxide. The technology, which Union Carbide licenses, accounts for about 25 percent of all polyethylene production. This technology is also used to manufacture other plastics, like polypropylene. DAVE JAMES Bound Brook, N.J., Sept. 15 The writer is Union Carbide's vice president for technology.</p>
