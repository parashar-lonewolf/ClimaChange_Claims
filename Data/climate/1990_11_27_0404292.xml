        <p>COULD biologists, ecologists and other natural scientists have more to say about the economics of the environment than economists themselves?</p>
        <p>Researchers calling themselves ecological economists are challenging traditional economics on its own turf, accusing economists of mismeasuring development, underestimating the intangible costs of pollution and ignoring society's responsibilities to future generations.</p>
        <p>While many economists dismiss the ideas of their fellow scientists and critics as both unoriginal and loosely reasoned, these notions are finding a respectful audience in bastions of the establishment, particularly those that deal with the third world. The rebels' ideas have special application for countries that depend heavily on their natural resources.</p>
        <p>The United States Agency for International Development and the conservative Pew Charitable Trusts underwrote a conference on ecological economics last May at the World Bank, which drew some 370 participants. And the Jessie Noyes Foundation in New York is supporting one of the ecological economists' favorite projects, an effort by the United Nations to incorporate environmental factors in the basic accounts used to measure national output.</p>
        <p>If the rebels succeed in the goal set by Robert Costanza, a biologist at the University of Maryland and a founder of the five-year-old International Society of Ecological Economists, they will persuade governments to give the "sustainability" of natural "life support systems" priority over conventionally measured economic growth. That could mean radical changes in policy, sharply reducing efforts to improve living standards through investments in land-intensive agriculture and resource extraction.</p>
        <p>But succeed or fail, they will almost certainly force economists to face up to the issue that traditional analysis tends to undervalue environmental resources. And they may kindle public debate on some very uncomfortable questions, everything from the need for population control to the compensation owed by the present generation to those who will inherit radioactive reactor wastes in the year 3000.</p>
        <p>Economic science long ago filed "environment" under N for natural resources. Breathable air, mountain scenery and edible marine life were categorized as inputs of production or goods for consumption, like machine tools or wheat or copper ore. The right decision on how much to use, explains Allen Kneese, an economist at Resources for the Future in Washington, depends on the "opportunity cost," what society would lose later by consuming the resource now.</p>
        <p>Sophisticated resource economists -- among them, Mr. Kneese -- are sensitive to the practical limitations of the framework. Markets alone cannot be depended upon to weigh, say, the cost of damaging a marsh that serves as a breeding ground for birds.</p>
        <p>But "conceptually, such values are not hard to incorporate," says Robert Repetto, an economist at the World Resources Institute in Washington. A determined economist could tote up the losses associated with filling in the wetland and compare them to the benefits of the shopping mall that would replace it. All too often, though, argues Dan Dudek, an economist at the Environmental Defense Fund in New York, "economists tend to ignore such intangible benefits, effectively setting their value at zero."  Accounting for Resources</p>
        <p>Another limitation is the economists' dependence on "discount rates" to account for the dimension of time in measurements of value. Discounting works fine for showing, say, that a ton of steel delivered today is worth more than the same ton delivered a year from now; the difference is an extra year's worth of use from the products made from the steel. When economies are working efficiently, the discount rate is equal to the interest rate; a year's delay in receiving that ton of steel would make it worth about 8 percent less.</p>
        <p>But the choice of discount rates becomes increasingly problematic in the long time frame of environmental resources. A town council might decide it is worth sacrificing a grove of 300-year-old spruce to save $100,000 on road construction. But what of future town residents, whose pleasure in seeing very large, very old trees will not be considered?</p>
        <p>Mr. Repetto notes that decisions affecting many generations can be even stickier. Carbon dioxide emissions may eventually force people to live indoors, protected from perpetual desert summer by air-conditioning. But what point would there be, asks Mr. Repetto, in discounting the loss of free access to the outdoors to future generations who have never known, and thus may never miss, the pleasure?  Calculating Depreciation</p>
        <p>Mr. Repetto and his colleagues at the World Resources Institute have been widely applauded for an attempt to correct a common distortion introduced by conventional economics practices: the failure to include natural resource depletion in national income accounts.</p>
        <p>When economists measure a nation's net output, they subtract capital depreciation, the loss of machines, vehicles and buildings in the ongoing production process. But they rarely account for gains or losses of less tangible forms of capital, like human skills. Equally important, they neglect changes in reserves of natural resources, which are typically large (and negative) in poor countries.</p>
        <p>The Repetto team used the example of Indonesia to show how important this omission can be in gauging national development. Losses from soil erosion, they calculated, reduce the net value of crop production by about 40 percent. And net losses of forest resources actually exceed timber harvests. Moreover, from 1980 to 1984 depletion of oil fields reduced the value of Indonesia's reserves base by about $10 billion annually, roughly 15 percent of national income.</p>
        <p>In industrialized countries, where total output is much larger relative to natural resource depletion, similar extensions of conventional accounting methods have been used to calculate the impact of environmental degradation. Japan, Germany and France all have ambitious projects under way. And the United Nations Statistical Office is working on a general framework for environment and natural resource accounting. Seeking a New Framework</p>
        <p>But ecological economists are not ready to permit researchers like Mr. Repetto, who accept the basic tenets of modern economic theory, to be the profession's toughest critics. What economics needs, they argue, is a whole new framework, one that fits economic production into ecological systems, rather than the other way around.</p>
        <p>To Herman Daly at the World Bank, David Pearce at the University of London and Paul Ehrlich at Stanford University, the key goal is the achievement of "sustainability" -- adjusting economic activity so it does not damage the natural systems that underpin all functioning economies. Too many economists, they argue, simply assume that the biosphere can roll with any economic punch and bounce back for more.</p>
        <p>But sustainability is proving hard to define and even harder to measure. One approach, now popular among ecological economists, is to calculate energy balances on the assumption that energy supplies represent the ultimate constraint on human activity. Mr. Costanza, for example, measures the amount of energy absorbed by swampland in order to compute the swamp's value.</p>
        <p>But economists have been down this road before. Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, an eccentric Rumanian economist who is now retired, spent a career mulling the relationship between economics and the laws of thermodynamics. The amount of energy in the universe is constant, but the amount available for work in a closed (economic) system is limited and constantly in decline.</p>
        <p>Energy is indeed critical to human activity, agrees William Nordhaus, an economist at Yale University. But only a tiny fraction of the fuel consumed is actually used to sustain life. Technology for efficient processing of inputs -- among them energy -- is thus the real, long-term constraint. And ecological economists are not any better at predicting how these limits will impinge than garden-variety economists.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daly, an economist by training who long ago defected to the enemy, approaches sustainability from another angle. He constructed an "index of sustainable economic welfare," adjusting conventionally measured output for environmental damage, resource depletion, the availability of leisure, even the degree of income equality. The index suggests that Americans' sustainable welfare peaked more than a decade ago, that "economic development" as contrasted with economic growth has stopped.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nordhaus and the Nobel Prize-winning economist James Tobin put together a less ambitious "measurement of economic welfare" in the early 1970's in response to Marxists, whose claims to be creating more liveable societies were then taken seriously. The two economists found that the output omitted from regular income accounts -- like the fruits of household labor -- roughly offset the unmeasured costs, like pollution. Thus growth in economic welfare (in advanced industrialized economies, anyway) roughly tracked the growth in conventionally measured output.</p>
        <p>At the heart of the sustainability question, Mr. Nordhaus argues, is the issue of endowing future generations with at least as much productive capacity as this generation inherited. Current levels of economic activity may deplete valuable resources and degrade ecological systems in irreversible ways, he acknowledges. But this generation will also pass on precious new technologies, cures for fatal diseases, incredibly efficient means for processing information, for example. Who is to judge whether our resource-stripping, environmentally stressful ways will more than offset this technological bounty?  Technological Pessimists</p>
        <p>Robert Hahn, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, offers another way of parsing the question. Traditional economics implicitly assumes that as a practical matter no wasting asset, whether it be oil or the atmospheric ozone layer, is absolutely critical to economic growth or human welfare. Ecological economists, by constrast, are technological pessimists: if nations are not careful, they will make the planet uninhabitable.</p>
        <p>No one really knows who is right. And to Mr. Hahn, the appropriate response to uncertainty is not agnosticism. It makes sense, he argues, to err on the side of caution where the penalty in output forgone is not high. The ecological economists thus score most tellingly, Mr. Hahn suggests, in their criticism of traditional economists' live-and-let-live approach to population issues.</p>
        <p>Traditional economics, with its focus on the welfare of individuals, has generally been indifferent to the overall scale of economic activity. But for any given living standard, it is virtually certain that more people mean more damage to ecological systems, whose carrying capacities are poorly understood. Thus, it may matter critically whether the world's population stabilizes at, say, 10 billion rather than 20 billion.</p>
        <p>It is not yet clear whether the ecologists will establish a beachhead in the economists' carefully constructed intellectual empire. What they have already demonstrated, though, is that environmental economics is too important to be left by default to economists. The Real Picture? When resource depletion is accounted for, Indonesia's growth rate falls from a spectacular 7.1 percent annual rate to a more modest 4 percent. (source: World Resources Institute)</p>

        <p>Because of a production error, an article in Science Times yesterday about ecological economists omitted several words in a sentence about their impact. The affected sentence, the first in the sixth paragraph, should have read, "But succeed or fail, they will almost certainly forceeconomists to face up to the issue that traditional analysis tends to undervalue environmental resources."</p>
