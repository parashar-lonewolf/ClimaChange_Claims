        <p>President Clinton's endorsement of strengthened Federal air pollution standards yesterday came as welcome news to elected officials in New York State and the surrounding region, where efforts to reduce soot, acid rain and smog have been undercut by clouds of pollutants carried on the wind from coal-fired plants in the Midwest.</p>
        <p>The fight over the stricter Federal standards, for fine soot and  smog ingredients, had sparked regional political battles that transcended partisan lines. Only Tuesday, for example, Senator Alfonse M.

        <p>President Clinton's endorsement of strengthened Federal air pollution standards yesterday came as welcome news to elected officials in New York State and the surrounding region, where efforts to reduce soot, acid rain and smog have been undercut by clouds of pollutants carried on the wind from coal-fired plants in the Midwest.</p>
        <p>The fight over the stricter Federal standards, for fine soot and  smog ingredients, had sparked regional political battles that transcended partisan lines. Only Tuesday, for example, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, a Republican not known for championing environmental causes, told the White House that he would fight any effort to weaken the standards, proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency last November.</p>
        <p>For New York and its neighbors, the most significant result from the change in Federal pollution rules will be that many places in the Midwest will now have to meet the same stricter standards that are already in effect in parts of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Largely because of imported pollution from the Midwest, the Northeastern states until now have been nearly alone in being forced to comply with stringent Federal requirements on cleanup of ozone, a main component of smog, said Robert C. Shinn Jr., New Jersey's environmental protection commissioner, who is chairman of a national advisory committee examining the problem of drifting pollution.</p>
        <p>''It's like a big domino game,'' Mr. Shinn said. ''Pennsylvania's downwind of Ohio, and so on. By the time you get to New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, that pollution is a big part of the total problem.''</p>
        <p>As a result, Republican officials from across the Northeast lauded the Democratic President  for standing firm on the new rules despite a bruising lobbying battle by industry.</p>
        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki of New York, who had personally lobbied on behalf of the changes, was among the Republicans hailing Mr. Clinton's move.</p>
        <p>''It means cleaner air, better health, and it's going to mean more jobs,'' Mr. Pataki said in an interview. ''We have for too long been penalized by particulates and ozone being generated in other parts of the country. What we finally have is a system of fair standards.''</p>
        <p>The Governor said jobs would flow to New York once Midwestern industries had to invest equally in pollution reductions, eliminating an economic advantage that has prevailed for seven years.</p>
        <p>But some of New York's biggest corporations, which have plants across the country, parted with the Governor, their frequent ally.</p>
        <p>The Business Council of New York State, representing the state's largest industries, opposed the tighter standards on fairly fundamental grounds. Kenneth J. Pokalsky, the council's director of environmental programs, said the ozone standard was arbitrary.</p>
        <p>''Unlike standards for most other pollutants, it's not based on any measurable impact,'' Mr. Pokalsky said. ''It's regulated mainly as an irritant, not a toxic chemical. So there's no way of measuring the environmental benefits of achieving a certain standard.''</p>
        <p>And the council opposed the new regulations on fine particles of soot on the ground that more research should be done first to define more precisely which particles are a health risk.</p>
        <p>''Is it the entire universe of small particles, or some specific one?'' said Mr. Pokalsky, who added that he was not surprised that the new standards had garnered strong bipartisan support.</p>
        <p>''There seems to be a great reluctance for officials to oppose any type of new environmental requirement,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But, he said, people tend to forget the costs that pile up as industries comply with each new rule. ''The economy ends up paying for it,'' he said, ''which means everyone ends up paying for it.''</p>
        <p>Supporters of the changes said  the full effect of the new rules would take years to achieve, allowing industries time to adapt and find efficient ways to cut emissions.</p>
        <p>S. William Becker, executive director of a Washington association of state and local pollution officials, said, ''It will be almost a decade before industry is forced to reduce the first pound of pollution as a result of the new fine-particulate standard.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Becker also said the problem of imported pollution was so overwhelming in places like New York City that something had had to be done to level the playing field.</p>
        <p>''You could impose an immediate moratorium on driving and shut down most industries in the city, and still exceed the Federal standard'' for ozone, he said. ''The air pollution from interstate transport is so significant it's imperative to have upwind cooperation.''</p>
