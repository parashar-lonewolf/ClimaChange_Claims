        <p>LEAD: Indoor air pollution, now virtually unregulated, constitutes a more dangerous public health problem than outdoor air pollution, scientists and health officials told a Senate panel today.</p>
        <p>Indoor air pollution, now virtually unregulated, constitutes a more dangerous public health problem than outdoor air pollution, scientists and health officials told a Senate panel today.</p>
        <p>Awareness that indoor air pollution may constitute a serious environmental hazard has been slowly increasing in recent years among scientists, policy makers and the public. But it was the recent realization that the contamination of buildings by radon was a broad national problem that spurred increasing interest in and research into the broader issue of indoor air pollution. Radon, a naturally occurring gas formed by the decay of radium, can cause lung cancer. Federal Action Urged</p>
        <p>A series of witnesses before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee's Environmental Protection Subcommittee called for vigorous Federal action to protect people from air pollution inside homes, offices and public buildings. They urged the Federal Government, particularly the Environmental Protection Agency, to do intensive research into the extent and causes of the pollution, to set safe indoor air levels and to suggest ways to meet the problem.</p>
        <p>Other than radon, some of the more ubiquitous indoor pollutants are cigarette smoke, formaldehyde used in furniture and other products, asbestos, carbon monoxide from stoves and other combustion, household pesticides, household solvents such as paint strippers, and some biological pollutants such as viruses and bacteria, the witnesses said.</p>
        <p>A. James Barnes, Deputy Administrator of the environmental agency, agreed that growing evidence showed ''that the indoor environment may pose a more serious risk to health than previously thought.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Barnes said in his testimony that, with buildings being constructed in airtight fashion to save energy and with people spending more of their time indoors, exposure to pollution inside buildings was increasing and for some pollutants was as much as five times the outdoor exposure. 'Sick Building Syndrome'</p>
        <p>The agency has estimated that as many as 20,000 cancer deaths are caused each year by exposure to high levels of radon that collect inside homes. The agency has also estimated that 3,500 to 6,500 cancer deaths a year are caused by exposure to other indoor air pollutants.</p>
        <p>But the public health officials testified that indoor air pollution was beginning to be seen as the cause of a wide range of other health problems, including respiratory problems among children. They also cited a recently recognized phenomenon, which they call the ''sick building syndrome,'' in which air pollution inside otherwise clean office buildings caused eye irritation, respiratory infection and nausea among workers, costing the United States economy millions of workdays a year.</p>
        <p>The subcommittee's investigation of indoor air pollution problems is part of a current Congressional effort to re-examine the Clean Air Act and determine if it needs strengthening and how. While the issue of indoor air has not received the kind of attention given other issues, such as acid rain, the health officials and members of the subcommittee said it might require urgent attention. 'Coordinated Response' Sought</p>
        <p>Senator George J. Mitchell, Democrat of Maine, who is chairman of the subcommittee, said, ''I believe we have clear evidence of health problems resulting from indoor air pollution and that an effective and coordinated response to this problem must be considered by this committee and this Congress.''</p>
        <p>Dr. John D. Spengler, professor of public health at the Harvard University School of Public Health, said the health effects of only a few indoor contaminants have been documented. But he added that it was being found that concentrations of contaminants inside homes often exceed the maximum safe levels established for hazardous waste cleanup sites. ''Therefore, it is common sense that we develop a rational and consistent policy for addressing human exposures to environmental contaminants,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America, suggested some specific remedies for indoor air pollution problems, including an immediate ban on all uses of asbestos, a ban on smoking in airplanes and other public places, a ban on household chemicals that cause cancer and more aggressive action by the environmental agency to help the public deal with the radon problem. He also called for a ''national clearinghouse,'' sponsored by the government and private institutions, to provide the consumer adequate information on indoor air haazards.''</p>
        <p>In a related development, the National Clean Air Coalition, an alliance of environmental public health groups, today called for an aggressive new program to ease the continuing threat of polluted air to Americans in cities, particularly the threat of the ozone that is a major consituent of smog.</p>
        <p>Richard E. Ayers, chairman of the coalition, said that three-fourths of urban areas in the United States would fail to meet the December 31, 1987, deadline for meeting even the current, inadequate ozone standard imposed by the Clean Air Act. He put much of the blame on the environmental agency for what he said was a failure to adequately carry out the law, along with state and local regulators.</p>
