        <p>House Votes to Rescind Tax Subsidies to Big Oil  House Democrats, joined by many Republicans, easily passed legislation that would rescind $14 billion in tax breaks and subsidies for oil companies and set the money aside to support renewable energy projects and conservation. One provision is intended to correct errors in drilling leases signed by the Interior Department in the late 1990s that allowed oil companies to escape billions in royalties.</p>

        <p>Fed Chief Warns of Deficit  Warning against complacency, the Federal Reserve chairman said recent positive trends on the federal budget masked dangers posed by deficits in Social Security and Medicare.</p>
