        <p>DEAR Diary,</p>
        <p>Looking back on it now, what a surprisingly delightful season it was, the winter of 1994-1995! Hardly anything like last year's miserable New Jersey winter. And certainly far from the predictions in the Farmer's Almanac, which forecast an even more extreme winter in the Garden State than that of 1993-1994.</p>
        <p>Yes, of course, there were a few minor travails here and there. And in truth, the season did present its share of annoyances. But, Dear Diary -- here in the spring of 1995 -- how pleasant it is to review these pages and recall the bracing challenges of the winds of winter! How satisfying to look back at the months we remember so well:</p>

        <p>DEAR Diary,</p>
        <p>Looking back on it now, what a surprisingly delightful season it was, the winter of 1994-1995! Hardly anything like last year's miserable New Jersey winter. And certainly far from the predictions in the Farmer's Almanac, which forecast an even more extreme winter in the Garden State than that of 1993-1994.</p>
        <p>Yes, of course, there were a few minor travails here and there. And in truth, the season did present its share of annoyances. But, Dear Diary -- here in the spring of 1995 -- how pleasant it is to review these pages and recall the bracing challenges of the winds of winter! How satisfying to look back at the months we remember so well:</p>
        <p>NOVEMBER: Although the warm weather in early November was wonderful, Dear Diary, we're trying to be prepared! But whatever shall we do? We have just visited the 14th snow-blower store in the county, and there is not a single machine to be had. The days are getting colder, and there is the prospect of sleet (and perhaps even snow!) at any time now. Yet every single snow blower was sold out by last July.</p>
        <p>In a stroke of luck, however, we did manage to find a dealer that promised delivery of a small machine by next August: how amazingly fortunate! Most of the other manufacturers will have no supplies until next fall. Oh, well, it's high time to look at the bright side: if early November is any predictor, this could well be the winter of global warming.</p>
        <p>And if not, the whole family will just have to make do with the trusty tools in the garage: those sturdy old curved shovels and those sharp steel ice-choppers. They worked well enough last winter! I especially like the newfangled crook-handled shovel that is so gentle on the homeowner's back! I confidently believe that, snow blower or no, we're certainly ready for anything this winter can throw at us in the month of December!</p>
        <p>DECEMBER: Only six shopping days until Christmas, Dear Diary, but just how do we get out to the mall? Yes, we were able to shovel off the sidewalk quickly enough, making light work of the early December blizzard that strangled the town for five days and caused the two major power outages. Alas, the new crook-handled shovel fell apart just as we broke through the five-foot bank of snow that blocked the garage.</p>
        <p>But that minor setback is hardly the real problem! After all, the town's snow plows haven't managed to visit our street for a week now. Even if we are able to chip out one of the cars from its block of ice, we fear that we will never be able to drive to the corner, never mind the mall!</p>
        <p>JANUARY: Such a happy new year it is, Dear Diary, now that the streets are clear again and the roof has been patched up after the collapse! You might think the average roof would be able to withstand the weight of the three consecutive blizzards of late December, let alone the unexpected storm on New Year's Day.</p>
        <p>But we are thankful, indeed, that the town has such talented carpenters and roofers, who have managed to circumvent snow, ice and high wind to make the repairs in less than four days! Personally, I am not of the opinion that the storm surcharge of $10,000 they billed us for coming out to the house was unreasonable in any way. At least the work is somewhat done! And thank goodness, too, the Christmas presents, stored in the attic after being opened, were only partly destroyed!</p>
        <p>Alas, there was one fairly regrettable consequence. The melting snow from the attic did demolish the ceiling in the second-floor guest room. But, taking the long view, that pesky room has long been in need of a thorough redecoration!</p>
        <p>FEBRUARY: Things have been fairly boring this month, Dear Diary, now that I am out of traction after my back seizure during the Valentine's Day blizzard. And luckily, the frostbite was not severe enough to keep me from bouncing out to start shoveling again for the President's Day storm. (How ironic it was that President Clinton declared New Jersey a snow-disaster state on that very day!)</p>
        <p>I find it remarkable just how much snow can be moved with a good, old-fashioned child's shovel, after all the adult tools have broken or been lost in the snowdrifts! But I am human: I admit to some envy of the neighbors who had the foresight to buy snow blowers last June, avoiding the July rush!</p>
        <p>I suppose, Dear Diary, that at times I am very much like that wastrel grasshopper who fails to anticipate the hardships of winter, unlike the industrious and thrifty ant.</p>
        <p>And speaking of ants, how delightful it is that the snow and the cold have severely reduced the activity of the ant colony that thrives in our kitchen, so that we only see 5 or 10 a day!</p>
        <p>MARCH: Happily, Dear Diary, the children have greatly improved their cross-country skiing skills by now, and -- also on the plus side -- the whole family's abilities have improved dramatically in managing hypothermia. So many below-zero days!</p>
        <p>We wouldn't be New Jerseyans without a few minor complaints, however:</p>
        <p>Why, for example, was it necessary for the oil company to claim that deliveries were impossible after the St. Patrick's Day blizzard? I should think the company's stalwart drivers might be adept at navigating the icy streets by now.</p>
        <p>Mind you, I don't object to the fact that we have been without heat for a week, which is understandable. But unfortunately, the freezing cold has made our cable-television box completely inoperable, and we have missed an entire week of blizzard reports on the weather channel!</p>
        <p>Dear Diary, the truth must be faced about the season: this year, March not only came in like a lion, but went out like the King of Beasts as well! Thank goodness April lies ahead, along with the raptures of spring!</p>
        <p>APRIL: I don't know whether the town will ever get over the irony, Dear Diary, that the Blizzard of the Century happened to coincide with income-tax day, April 15! Naturally, no one in town was able to file a single return, and it may be weeks before it is possible to reach a mailbox. That's because the streets are still unplowed after more than a week.</p>
        <p>Certainly, we understand that the town has run out of money, and that the budget for snow removal was exceeded back in January. But that is hardly a proper reason to leave an entire town unplowed when our Form 1040 returns must be filed immediately!</p>
        <p>While it is true that the first of the dog-sled teams have begun to make emergency visits to our block, supplying much-needed food supplies, plowed streets would be preferable.</p>
        <p>And we worry: How will the Federal Government deal with an entire New Jersey town in tax arrears? Will we all be arrested en masse, or block by block? But perhaps things shall all be sorted out with the advent of May -- and the arrival of spring, glorious spring!</p>
        <p>MAY: How curious it was, Dear Diary, that the last snowstorm of the winter just happened to fall after the final-frost date in mid-May! Of course, the drifts melted quickly. But alas, all our tomatoes and peppers were frozen, and I fear that many of our ornamentals were damaged by cold. It is preferable, however, to look at the bright side: at least we don't live in Alaska!</p>
        <p>And so, Dear Diary, there you have it: the winter of 1994-1995. Oh, there were some trying moments, to be sure, but all of it was taken in stride! And if I may say so, this season was absolutely nothing like the real winters that I endured as a boy, back in the days when a winter was really a winter.</p>
        <p>In truth, Dear Diary, rereading all of these pages has a wonderfully energizing effect. Why, it almost makes you want to look forward to the winter of 1995-1996!</p>
