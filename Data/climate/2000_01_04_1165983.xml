        <p>In the past, presidents of the United Automobile Workers union, men like Walter Reuther and Douglas A. Fraser, were well-known national figures not just because they could shut down the world's largest companies but also because they were politically influential and frequently on television.</p>
        <p>Stephen P. Yokich, the union's president since 1995, has taken a different approach, shunning the limelight and focusing on contract issues. Believing that he can communicate most effectively with his members through local union leaders, he has said virtually nothing in public during strikes and other showdowns with auto makers. While he has visited Washington frequently to discuss issues like trade and global warming, he has favored private meetings with politicians.</p>

        <p>In the past, presidents of the United Automobile Workers union, men like Walter Reuther and Douglas A. Fraser, were well-known national figures not just because they could shut down the world's largest companies but also because they were politically influential and frequently on television.</p>
        <p>Stephen P. Yokich, the union's president since 1995, has taken a different approach, shunning the limelight and focusing on contract issues. Believing that he can communicate most effectively with his members through local union leaders, he has said virtually nothing in public during strikes and other showdowns with auto makers. While he has visited Washington frequently to discuss issues like trade and global warming, he has favored private meetings with politicians.</p>
        <p>But now Mr. Yokich is trying to rebuild the political power of the union, most notably by negotiating paid holidays for 400,000 workers at General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler on Election Day in 2000 and 2002. The prospect that more union workers might turn out to vote, hand out pamphlets and drive other Democrats to polling booths has alarmed Republicans.</p>
        <p>The tricky part for Mr. Yokich, pollsters and politicians said, will be persuading the rank and file to vote for candidates endorsed by union leaders. Earning $50,000 to $120,000 a year, the union's members are too affluent to benefit from Democratic social spending, and prosperous enough to be concerned about income tax rates. Many members are conservative on social issues.</p>
        <p>Yet the leadership has tended to support Democrats, particularly for president, perceiving them as friendlier on workers' rights.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yokich said the union must emphasize political concerns that apply to all members and transcend partisan politics. ''We support those who support us; the party doesn't matter,'' he said in an interview.</p>
        <p>Two such concerns, he said, are international trade and global warming. The problem is that neither former Senator Bill Bradley nor Vice President Al Gore has taken Mr. Yokich's positions on either issue. The union will endorse a presidential candidate next month; it had opposed the A.F.L.-C.I.O's decision to endorse Mr. Gore early, in October.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yokich advocates balancing free trade with what he calls ''fair trade,'' requiring other countries to follow rules similar to those in the United States on safety, the environment and workers' rights to form unions. He is particularly critical of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he says has destroyed more high-paying jobs than it has created, an assertion questioned by many economists.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bradley and Mr. Gore  have track records of supporting free trade. Mr. Yokich said he had been disappointed that they were not at a peaceful protest by union members at the recent meeting of the World Trade Organization in Seattle.</p>
        <p>Global warming is another difficult issue for Mr. Yokich. With each gallon of gasoline they burn, automobiles release heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, so environmentalists have begun lobbying for more stringent fuel-economy rules. But the union contends that tougher rules are unnecessary because many other industries contribute to the problem and because developing nations have not agreed to limits on their emissions of such gases. Mr. Bradley and particularly Mr. Gore have both called for tighter fuel-economy rules. While Mr. Bradley has been less outspoken than Mr. Gore, he supported a Senate resolution calling for stiffer fuel-economy rules on sport utility vehicles and other light trucks, which are allowed much worse fuel economy than cars. The measure was narrowly defeated on Sept. 15 after the union joined automakers in strenuous lobbying against it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yokich said he had expressed concerns to Mr. Gore about the Clinton administration's policies on global warming, but quickly added that he was a friend of the environment.</p>
        <p>''I talk to the Sierra Club, so you can't just say, 'he's about jobs for his members','' Mr. Yokich said. ''I belong to the Sierra Club, I belong to Ducks Unlimited.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fraser said that Mr. Yokich had to become more active politically because the most pressing issues facing the union, like international competition, environmental protections and health care, could not be settled at the bargaining table with auto makers.</p>
        <p>''The future of the members of the U.A.W. rests with Congress and the legislative process more than it ever did in the past,'' Mr. Fraser said. ''That's why you have to get more involved in the political process.''</p>
