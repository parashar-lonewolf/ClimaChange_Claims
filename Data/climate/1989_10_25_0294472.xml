        <p>LEAD: AT a benefit party tomorrow evening for the Fresh Air Fund at Roseland in Manhattan, only decaffeinated coffee will be served. Two weeks ago at a dinner for the New York Public Library, the waiters poured decaffeinated coffee exclusively for the 400 or so guests, who included Barbara Bush.</p>
        <p>AT a benefit party tomorrow evening for the Fresh Air Fund at Roseland in Manhattan, only decaffeinated coffee will be served. Two weeks ago at a dinner for the New York Public Library, the waiters poured decaffeinated coffee exclusively for the 400 or so guests, who included Barbara Bush.</p>
        <p>''We have been serving only decaffeinated coffee the past four years,'' said James Kirsch, the vice president of Abigail Kirsch Productions, the caterer for the library dinner. Ronnie Davis, the president of Washington Street Caterers, which provided the food for the Roseland benefit, estimated that when he offers both decaffeinated and regular coffee, 80 percent of the guests ask for decaffeinated.</p>
        <p>''There are so many good decaffeinated coffees now,'' Mr. Davis said. ''Sometimes we serve only decaffeinated coffee, and the regular-coffee drinkers don't know the difference.''</p>
        <p>High-quality decaffeinated coffees are proliferating. Under Federal regulations, 97 percent of the caffeine must be removed from any coffee labeled decaffeinated. Although coffee drinking has declined steadily for the last 25 years in the United States, people who still drink coffee are opting for better quality, producers say, and especially top-quality decaffeinated coffees.</p>
        <p>The changes are not restricted to stores that specialize in coffee. Supermarket shelves are now filled with decaffeinated whole beans in a wide variety of styles and roasts, and even the biggest producers, like Maxwell House and Nestle Foods, are joining in.</p>
        <p>A tasting of 28 decaffeinated coffees at The New York Times confirmed that both the blended and 100 percent Colombian varieties have come a long way since the days of the little orange packets served with cups of hot water. Along with removing caffeine, decaffeination takes away some of the flavor in coffee. But the tasting found that there are far more good decaffeinated coffees available now.</p>
        <p>The improvement comes largely because producers are using better beans for making decaffeinated coffee. Producers say they are responding to consumer demands for stronger, better-tasting coffee and concerns about caffeine's effect on health. The fact that more people are grinding their own fresh beans, which makes for a better brew, also helps.</p>
        <p>''People who buy the better specialty coffees tend to be younger and more affluent,'' said Tim Castle, the vice president of the Specialty Coffee Association of America and the owner of Castle &amp; Company, a coffee dealer in Los Angeles. ''They're also the ones more concerned about health and caffeine.''</p>
        <p>David Olsen, a vice president and the director of communications for the Starbucks Coffee Company in Seattle, said: ''People who are drinking coffee are drinking better coffee. It's not just a choice of decaf or regular, but what kind of decaf.''</p>
        <p>This improvement in quality and the explosion of new brands come at a time when coffee consumption has been declining. Only 52 percent of the American population drank coffee in any form in the winter of 1989, according to an annual survey, released yesterday and conducted for the International Coffee Organization. That compares with 55 percent in 1985 and 75 percent in 1962, when coffee consumption in the United States peaked.</p>
        <p>Decaffeinated coffee was consumed, at least sometimes, by only 4 percent of the population in 1962. Consumption had increased to 17.5 percent in 1987, and although it slipped to 15.8 percent in 1988, it rose to 16.7 percent in the winter of 1989. The survey of 7,500 people age 10 and older was conducted by telephone by Data Group Inc. of Plymouth Meeting, Pa. The margin of sampling error was not available yesterday.</p>
        <p>But the survey figures do not tell the whole story. Roasters, distributors and retailers of whole-bean and better-quality coffees report that the decaffeinated versions account for 20 to 30 percent of sales. And decaffeinated coffee constitutes up to 40 percent of coffee sales in some restaurants, especially at dinner.</p>
        <p>''I'm a specialty dealer, and at this upper end of the market decaffeinated has been growing at a greater rate than is reflected in the general market,'' said Donald N. Schoenholt, the president of the Gillies Coffee Company in Manhattan, a wholesale concern that sells nationwide.</p>
        <p>Rarely is a high-quality coffee introduced these days that is not also available in decaffeinated form. And many households now greet the morning with the penetrating whine of the coffee grinder. The Fauchon brand from Paris at Fraser-Morris in Manhattan, Starbucks seasonal Christmas blend available by mail and at Starbucks shops in the West, and the new Hunter's blend introduced this fall by the Hay Day markets in Connecticut are some examples. There are exotic varietals like Sumatra and an array of flavors, including chocolate-almond, cinnamon and amaretto.</p>
        <p>''We've been seeing steady growth of about 6 percent a year in specialty decaf,'' said Mr. Castle, the president of the Specialty Coffee Association. ''Even in the face of the decline in coffee drinking in this country, the specialty-coffee category continues to grow. That's why you're seeing the bigger companies getting into better quality.''</p>
        <p>Maxwell House has introduced two new decaffeinated brands, Rich French Roast and Private Collection Custom Blend, while Nestle Foods is test-marketing Taster's Choice Original Blend in ground, not instant form, in Phoenix and Denver. Kenneth Defren, the director of public affairs for General Foods U.S.A., said the new Maxwell House Rich French Roast, introduced in April, was proving to be ''the most successful new product in the coffee industry in the past decade.'' He refused to cite any figures. He added that the company is ''investing heavily in improving quality because that's the way the market is going.''</p>
        <p>Quality in coffee starts with the beans. The arabica variety, grown at higher altitudes, delivers better, more complex flavor than the cheaper, high-yielding robusta beans that are normally used in most supermarket blends and in instant coffees. Arabica beans normally contain about half as much caffeine as robusta.</p>
        <p>Decaffeination makes producing a good cup of coffee more difficult. In extracting the caffeine, which is done before the beans are roasted, some of the flavor and aroma components of the coffee bean are lost, resulting in a fairly one-dimensional taste.</p>
        <p>There is still considerable debate over which of five different decaffeination methods produces the best coffee. In the past the direct-contact method, in which the beans are treated with methylene chloride to extract the caffeine, was thought to be the process that best preserved the flavor. But there is confusion among consumers over safety.</p>
        <p>In July, the Food and Drug Administration banned the use of methylene chloride in hair sprays but has deferred any decision on the compound as a decaffeinating agent.</p>
        <p>''Scientific data showed that as an inhalant it could cause cancer in animals, but we have no evidence that it is a hazard in coffee,'' said Chris Leckos, a press officer for the agency. He added that the agency is currently not studying the chemical in coffee.</p>
        <p>The Federal limit on residues of the chemical in the coffee is 10 parts per million, but generally, coffees decaffeinated with it have less than half that amount. Residues are further diminished when the coffee is roasted, then brewed.</p>
        <p>General Foods recently converted its decaffeination process from methylene chloride to one using carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>Other companies extract caffeine by first soaking the beans in water, then drawing the water off and treating it with ethyl acetate, a compound found in fruit. The ethyl acetate binds with the caffeine to isolate it, and the caffein-free water is added back to the beans. This process is usually identified as ''natural'' on the label, as is Nestle's proprietary method, using coffee oil and water. Taster's Choice, MJB and Hills Brothers are Nestle brands that use this method.</p>
        <p>Many consumers prefer to buy coffee decaffeinated by the water process because they think it is safer. With the water process the beans are soaked only in hot water to remove the highly soluable caffeine. But more of the flavor components are supposedly flushed out with the water in this method. And because the caffeine is burned off and cannot be recaptured, this adds to the cost.</p>
        <p>When methods like methylene chloride or carbon dioxide are used, the caffeine can be recaptured and sold to pharmaceutical companies, reducing decaffeination's cost. Regardless of the method, decaffeinated coffee always costs more than regular because of the additional processing required. Often, before roasting, the beans must also be shipped to and from decaffeinating plants in Europe, Canada or Mexico.</p>
        <p>The water method is often called the Swiss water process because until recently, it was done only in Switzerland. In January 1988, the Coffex division of Jacobs Suchard Canada Inc. opened a water-process decaffeination plant in Vancouver, British Columbia. Donald Macdonald, the general manager of Coffex, disputed the contention that more flavor is lost using the water method. ''The process has been refined over what it was a few years ago, and now it's hard to tell the difference.''</p>
        <p>The tasting would support Mr. Macdonald's argument. All but two of the most highly rated coffees were decaffeinated using the water process.  Mail Orders NOW that most coffee producers are using vacuum-packed bags, it is easy to order coffee by mail without sacrificing freshness.</p>
        <p>The producers whose coffees were tasted offer a wide variety of them by mail. Here are the addresses and telephone numbers:  Cafe La Semeuse, P.O. Box 429, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11222; 800-242-6333.  Caravali Coffees, 1301 First Avenue, Seattle, Wash. 98101; 800-647-0647.  Community Kitchens, P.O. Box 2311, Baton Rouge, La. 70821-2311; 800-535-9901.  Elkin Coffee Company (Fairwinds brand), P.O. Box 1294, Concord, N.H. 03302-1294; 800-645-4515.  Gillies Coffee Company, 160 Bleecker Street, New York, N.Y. 10012; 212-614-0900.  Starbucks Coffee Company, 2010 Airport Way South, Seattle, Wash. 98134; 800-445-3428.  Zabar's, 2245 Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10024; 212-496-1234.  ESPRESSO AND CAPPUCCINO</p>
        <p>RECONCILING a taste for strong European after-dinner coffee and a good night's sleep is easier now that so many restaurants offer decaffeinated espresso and cappuccino in addition to decaffeinated American-style coffee. And espresso drinkers will usually find less difference between decaffeinated and regular espresso than between ordinary decaffeinated and regular coffee.</p>
        <p>The intensity of flavor in a cup of espresso can often compensate for the lack of richness and complexity usually caused by the decaffeination process. In fact, when using a standard decaffeinated blend, including some espresso-roasted beans can add body to the coffee.</p>
        <p>Espresso beans are roasted longer so they become darker. And surprisingly, even if they have not been decaffeinated, the darker roasted beans will contain less caffeine than regular beans because the additional roasting destroys a certain amount.</p>
        <p>In today's market there are more dark-roast coffees than ever, including some coffees imported from Italy and France. In some shops French roast is slightly stronger than Italian roast, but in others the reverse is true. Coffees called ''Vienna roast'' are usually a blend of regular and espresso beans.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, a label suggesting an espresso roast can be misleading. For example, Maxwell House's new Rich French Roast and MJB's European Roast, while stronger than those brands' other blends, are not richer than the blends of a number of specialty coffee companies.</p>
