        <p>THE homes at the Yellowstone Mountain Club would never be confused with the simple log cabins that once dotted the Old West.</p>
        <p>Instead of the one-room structures hastily thrown up by a miner or cowboy, the homes at the club, in Big Sky, Mont., are more likely to have 7,000 square feet, multiple mammoth rock fireplaces and infinity pools.</p>
        <p>The Yellowstone Club, 50 miles or so from Bozeman, is an unusual private development conceived by Timothy L. Blixseth, a multimillionaire ski enthusiast, where every home is within a short schuss of a chair lift and where the rich and famous find a rarefied level of exclusivity.</p>
        <p>But the Yellowstone Club and Mr. Blixseth have attracted attention of late not just because of the over-the-top homes there, but also because of the complaints by a prominent investor. Last week hearings were held on a lawsuit by Greg LeMond, the champion cyclist who is also an investor in the club, in which he accused Mr. Blixseth of borrowing hundreds of millions of dollars from the club without collateral, a charge Mr. Blixseth's lawyer has vigorously denied.</p>
        <p>However the legal case turns out, the Yellowstone Club is likely to leave a lasting impression across the mountains of southern Montana, with its massive, stylish and, some say, excessive version of good living.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blixseth, who started out in the logging industry, made news in December when he announced plans to build a Yellowstone Club home to be put up for sale. The 53,000-square-foot complex, called the Pinnacle, will have enough underground parking for 20 S.U.V.'s, a heliport and ice-skating rink and, at $155 million, could be the most expensive home for sale in the world. The groundbreaking is scheduled for June, with completion within 18 to 24 months, his son Beau Blixseth said in an interview.</p>
        <p>While the Pinnacle may be extreme, all of the homes at the Yellowstone Club are at the extreme end of things.</p>
        <p>The Yellowstone Club is the only place of its kind, a private ski and golf resort where people have come from around the world to build vacation homes. Its motto is ''Private Powder,'' and it consists of 13,600 mountainous acres in the Madison Range north of Yellowstone Park.</p>
        <p>There are 60 ski runs totaling more than 35 miles and 3,000 feet of vertical drop, and each home is built within a short distance of a run. The slopes are meticulously groomed or covered with untouched powder, and, with just 85 homes built so far, the chair lifts are often nearly empty, even in the heart of winter.</p>
        <p>''I haven't skied bump in eight years,'' said Hank Kashiwa, a former Olympic skier who is the vice president for marketing.</p>
        <p>The security staff is led by an ex-Secret Service agent, Mr. Kashiwa said, and no one gets past an imposing stone gatehouse who is not a member, a guest of a member or a prospective member.</p>
        <p>There will be 864 ''front doors'' -- condos and houses -- if the club is completely built. To date the club has 300 members and in addition to the 85 completed, another 85 homes are under construction. Land prices start at $2.25 million to $9.6 million for 1 to 2.2 acres. Custom homes start at about $4 million and condominiums at $3.2 million. There are ranches as well, but none are for sale now. Members pay a refundable $300,000 initial fee and $16,000 in annual dues.</p>
        <p>Not just anyone can buy into the club. The Yellowstone Club is more like a family than a club or resort, club officials insist. Prospective members must pass a ''sniff test'' of sorts. ''If they are rude to the staff or demanding, it's an indicator,'' Mr. Kashiwa said.</p>
        <p>Members own their land and homes, but all sales go through the Yellowstone Club brokerage and an owner cannot convey title without the club's approval.</p>
        <p>Bill Gates and Dan Quayle are members. Jack Kemp is on the board .</p>
        <p>WARREN MILLER, at 82 years old, is a kind of father figure here. Mr. Miller's claim to fame is the annual extreme-skiing films he once made and toured around the country. His legend lives on and many of the homes -- including his -- have his black-and-white photos or cartoons on the wall.</p>
        <p>Members can also visit the caviar bar, with a towering mahogany back bar, in the Warren Miller Lodge at the bottom of one of the main ski areas. There are 21 condominium units, starting at just under $6 million. Caviar starts at $120 and runs up to $350 per serving.</p>
        <p>There are four restaurants owned by the club, a sommelier and a concierge service, so members coming for Christmas can arrange for catering and staff for a party.</p>
        <p>The homes on the ski slopes are on center stage here, each placed to command a view of one of the many snow-blanketed mountains. The fact that climate change seems to be shortening the ski season here and elsewhere in the West doesn't appear to have deterred the investments.</p>
        <p>Each house is built to a grand scale. Take the River Runs Through It home, a $16 million, 10,000-square-foot house now under construction, tucked into the lodgepole forest with a drop-dead view of Cedar Mountain. Connecting the guesthouse and the main house is a room with a glass ceiling, glass walls and a glass bridge, with an enclosed and heated $80,000 ''river'' flowing beneath it.</p>
        <p>The home has six fireplaces and a two-sided infinity Jacuzzi. There's an outdoor fireplace with a built-in barbecue and a waterfall. The home is covered with ''live edge'' lap siding, which are overlapping boards sawn from a Douglas fir tree with the bark still on the bottom edge.</p>
        <p>Inside there is a stand-up Jacuzzi with another waterfall. And there are nine sleeper chairs in a home theater.</p>
        <p>The house is built of timbers reclaimed from bridge trusses and warehouses in six states. ''Homes here have to have the grand feeling,'' said Greg Dukette of Bitterroot Builders, which is building the house.</p>
        <p>One of the finished homes for sale is the 7,000-square-foot Fandango. It is done in the Old West style, but much of it is covered in 19th-century barnwood from New Hampshire. The kitchen counter is made from a three-inch-thick board from a giant tree, the stools are worn leather saddles and the footrest is from a section of rusted rail from a railroad. A giant chandelier hangs in the living room, fashioned from a tangled cluster of elk antlers. It is now on the market for $5.95 million.</p>
        <p>THEN there is the Bear Paw, a light-filled 8,000-square-foot home with a 3,000-foot deck set on a 17-acre lot, valued at $17 million. Several giant old-growth logs serve as the beams. It has stained concrete counter tops, heated stone floors, a boot drier and an indoor and outdoor fireplace. A twisted pine banister was made by a local artisan.</p>
        <p>''No one wants the perfect Lincoln Log look,'' said Craig Kinneman, of CK Design, who built this home and 13 others here. People who do use logs now want them out of round to retain the rustic charm, but for the most part, he said, log homes are passé. ''We've gotten away from logs and we're using a lot of recycled timber,'' he said. ''It's the look: post and beam, square timbers.''</p>
        <p>The dark wood floors in the Bear Paw are sawn from railroad trestles that had been partly underwater near the Great Salt Lake and have been sliced into dark reddish-brown flooring. ''Everybody's looking for a little piece of history,'' he said.</p>
        <p>One non-Western home here is the 12,000-square-foot, $7.5 million house built by Beverly and Dan Stephenson, real estate developers from Temecula, Calif. ''We travel a lot in Europe and ski a lot,'' Ms. Stephenson said, ''and we tried to bring the feel of Europe to Montana.''</p>
        <p>Each room is named after one of their favorite European ski areas, from Aviemore to Chamonix. The centerpiece, though, is a three-floor staircase modeled after one in Skibo Castle, built in the 12th century in Scotland. A game room, lined in dark maple with four PlayStations, is called the Alex after the Hotel Alex in Zermatt. The home includes a 1,342-square-foot attached guesthouse modeled after a French country cottage.</p>
        <p>The place has just been finished and Mr. Stephenson couldn't be happier to be in it. ''I've skied every major ski resort in the world and, heavens no, I've never skied anyplace like this,'' he said. ''The powder skiing here is staggering.'' And the privacy is unparalleled. ''I've always wanted to own my own ski area,'' he said. ''This is like owning your own resort without the overhead.''</p>
