        <p>LEAD: With bitter arctic cold sweeping across much of the nation, dozens of utilities and large industrial customers are scrambling to secure enough energy to avoid shortages and plant shutdowns.</p>
        <p>With bitter arctic cold sweeping across much of the nation, dozens of utilities and large industrial customers are scrambling to secure enough energy to avoid shortages and plant shutdowns.</p>
        <p>The cold wave is the first major test of the ability of the pipeline system to meet the heaviest demand for natural gas since the Reagan Administration deregulated prices five years ago.</p>
        <p>''Right now it is doing well,'' said Michael German, senior vice president of the American Gas Association, an industry trade group. ''The issue is how long the system can maintain record deliverabilities.'' Operating at Capacity</p>
        <p>Natural gas pipelines have been operating at full capacity for more than a week, and dozens of steel mills and automobile and chemical plants in many parts of the Midwest and Northeast have been forced to switch to fuel oil, propane and other power sources.</p>
        <p>Analysts said these and other industrial users represented about a third of all gas-shipment orders. Because they can burn other fuels, their supply contracts allow the pipeline companies to shut off supplies to them when cold waves cause a surge in demand. These interruptible contracts have lower rates.</p>
        <p>''There has been no curtailment of firm customers by major pipelines, and we don't expect it for the holidays,'' said R. Skip Horvath, an official of the Interstate Gas Association of America, a trade group in Washington representing large pipeline companies. He was referring to customers, including millions of homeowners, who rely solely on natural gas for heating.</p>
        <p>The National Weather Service says this month could be the coldest December of the century; the average temperature nationwide was 18 percent below normal through Dec. 16. Busy Month for Pipelines</p>
        <p>Pipeline companies say gas shipments, running 30 percent above normal levels, could set a monthly record. The American Gas Association said the highest monthly volume was 2.4 trillion cubic feet in January 1979. Mr. German estimated that shipments this month would range from 2.3 trillion to 2.5 trillion cubic feet.</p>
        <p>Industry analysts and pipeline executives said the record cold wave would probably put an end to the surplus of natural gas that gave consumers an upper hand and kept prices depressed over the last four years. It could also stimulate pipeline construction even beyond the $10 billion worth now on the drawing boards, the analysts said.</p>
        <p>Prices have soared as natural gas inventories, at a record high in mid-November, slipped below their normal early-winter level.</p>
        <p>Sub-zero temperatures are forecast for northern Texas and Oklahoma this weekend.. That would freeze water vapor in hundreds of wells, temporarily cutting gas production. Shortages: Real and Feared</p>
        <p>Energy analysts say that if bitterly cold weather again moves south to the Gulf of Mexico for periods of a week or more in coming months, shortages and serious power curtailments for much of the nation may be unavoidable. Scattered shortages of propane and home heating oil were reported last week, especially in the Northeast.</p>
        <p>''Even if we have normal weather in January, February and March, we're going to be on the ropes because of the storage runoffs that are occuring now,'' said John E. Olson, a natural-gas analyst with the First Boston Corporation in Houston.</p>
        <p>In recent days a number of utilities, industrial users and other large gas consumers have signed or entered negotiations for long-term supply contracts. Many of them were influenced by reports that public gas utilities were offering more than $3 per thousand cubic feet in the spot market, and finding few takers, to keep up with soaring demand. A month ago prices were in the $1.70 range.</p>
        <p>The spot market, which deals in natural gas for shipment in 30 days or less, has grown to account for about 75 percent of orders taken by pipeline companies since price controls ended. Placing Their Orders</p>
        <p>Sharply depleted gas inventories will keep prices from plunging in the spring when pipeline companies place orders with producers to rebuild their stocks. Prices paid to producers in recent years have ranged from $1.30 per thousand cubic feet in slack periods of spring and fall to about $2 in January, typically the month of peak demand.</p>
        <p>A shift to longer contracts and higher prices, if it is sustained, should give producers incentive to raise their drilling budgets, industry officials said.</p>
        <p>''This winter of 1989-90 is going to be a watershed'' for the industry, said Thomas A. Petrie, managing director of Petrie, Parkman &amp; Company, an energy investment firm in Denver.</p>
        <p>Rising natural gas consumption in recent years had already caused many large independent gas producers, including Burlington Resources, Enron Oil and Gas, Anadarko Petroleum and Union Texas Petroleum, to increase their drilling budgets for 1990.</p>
        <p>With economic factors pointing toward rising prices, ''the incentive to drill is increasing,'' said David N. Fleischer, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</p>
        <p>Theodore R. Eck, Amoco Inc.'s chief economist, said drilling activity would rise sharply if gas prices averaged near $2.50 per thousand cubic foot in the coming years. A Cleaner Fuel</p>
        <p>For the first eight months of this year natural gas consumption was up 14 percent over the comparable period of 1986, according to the Energy Information Administration. Growth is expected to outpace other fuels, in part because natural gas is one of the least-polluting fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>Many analysts said 30-day contracts now being negotiated would range from $2.40 to $2.60 per thousand cubic feet in January, compared with an average of about $1.70 in November and $1.90 in December. With the squeeze on inventories, natural gas prices should move into a higher trading range in 1990.</p>
        <p>''Prices won't be as important'' to pipeline executives in the weeks ahead as they search for new gas supplies this winter, said Charles M. Oglesby, executive vice president of the Coastal Natural Gas Group, operator of the nation's fourth largest pipeline system.</p>
        <p>He said pipelines near the Gulf Coast would not wait until spring to rebuild their storage reserves if temperatures moderate and prices ease in the coming weeks.</p>
