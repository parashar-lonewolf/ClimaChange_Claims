        <p>Prime Minister Tony Blair urged the international community to consider global warming a dire threat and agree on a plan of action to curb the ''alarming'' growth of greenhouse gases. The threat, he said in a speech, poses a ''challenge so far-reaching in its impact and irreversible in its destructive power that it alters radically human existence.'' With Britain assuming the rotating presidency of the Group of 8 industrialized countries next year, Mr. Blair said he would make it a priority to urge the member nations to agree on the ''basic science'' of climate change and its threat, and on the best way to try to address the problem. But he said it was also essential to reach out to other countries, including China and India.</p>
