        <p>AS ridged as crocodile skin, the marshy coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge stretches 110 miles from the Canning River in the west to Alaska's border with Canada in the east. Over a few weeks in the early Arctic autumn, the mottled green length of the plain deepens to the color of coffee grounds and rust, a dark vein between the slate Beaufort Sea and the frayed northern edge of the Brooks mountain range.</p>
        <p>The fate of this hushed span of tundra, like many other matters, may hang on the outcome of the presidential election. If Gov. George W. Bush of Texas is the new president, this plain and the oil deposits it covers may become an unlikely proving ground for the kind of company BP Amoco is and what it aspires to be: an oil company that is also a protector of the environment.</p>
        <p>From its base in London, BP Amoco, the world's third-largest oil company and arguably the most powerful player in Alaskan oil, has broken ranks with most of the petroleum industry and worked to build a reputation as an environmental pioneer, while continuing to promote oil development. Over the last three years, it has acknowledged the danger of global warming and embraced alternative fuels. To foster this image, BP Amoco unveiled a sunburst logo and a new motto: Beyond Petroleum.</p>
        <p>So far, BP, which pumps slightly more than 300,000 barrels of oil a day from Alaska, has sidestepped the question of drilling on the coastal plain of the refuge, an emotional environmental issue that gained national attention during the presidential race.</p>
        <p>Drilling proponents, including Mr. Bush, the Alaskan congressional delegation and most of the Republican Party, say the country's energy independence hinges on tapping the billions of barrels of oil that geologists suspect are below the plain's permafrost, perhaps enough to pump a million barrels a day for 20 years. For opponents of the drilling, including Vice President Al Gore, the issue is a zero-sum game: if the area is opened to development, a rare wilderness where many birds and animals bear their young would be lost.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has said unequivocally that he would open the coastal plain to oil exploration and production, though he would need Congressional support to proceed. Sir John Browne, the BP chief executive, said last week that if the area was unlocked under a Republican administration, BP would be interested in new exploration opportunities there. If it bids on leases to develop fields, which is highly probable given the demands on the company to bolster production and its stock price, BP would have a chance to show what Beyond Petroleum really means.</p>
        <p>A green oil company may seem an oxymoron, but some regulators, scientists, environmentalists and investors say they cautiously believe that the company might be trying to transform itself and an industry that has become synonymous with pollution. For the last few years, environmentalists and indigenous groups have met with BP executives and board members to try to persuade them to promise not to drill in the refuge, just as the company pledged a decade ago to stay out of Antarctica. Those who have placed some faith in BP see the Arctic Refuge, home to scarce, unique wildlife, as the crucial test of the company's environmental resolve.</p>
        <p>The BP record so far is mixed. The company's other activities in Alaska over the last few years suggest that there is a vast geographical and philosophical gulf within the company. On one side are executives in London who preach environmentalism; on the other are engineers in Anchorage who face the pressure of oil-driven local politics and their own bottom line.</p>
        <p>BP executives repeat a company-wide mantra of ''no damage'' to the environment, and its units have to meet certain environmental goals. ''We have learned a lot in 30 years,'' said F. X. O'Keefe, the head of BP's Alaska Exploration unit. ''Our record shows we can go into different areas with little to no impact.''</p>
        <p>But the company's stock price ultimately depends on how much oil it draws out of the ground and at what cost. To ensure a steady flow of oil as supplies from Alaska's North Slope decline, BP has proceeded with projects and campaigns that pose significant risks to Alaska's ecology, said many state and federal regulators, wildlife biologists, environmentalists and representatives of native peoples.</p>
        <p>''They're trying to present a new BP, but it's business as usual,'' said Francis A. Grant-Suttie, who, as director of private-sector initiatives at the World Wildlife Fund, meets regularly with BP executives. ''On the P.R. level, they have been successful at differentiating themselves from others, but by virtue of what they're doing on the coastal plain, you can see it's sheer rhetoric.''</p>
        <p>THIS year, the company agreed to a compliance order with the state of Alaska that prohibits it from drilling several months of the year at Northstar, the first offshore well in the North American Arctic. The state contends that BP would not be able to clean up an oil spill in the open waters off Northstar. BP was also placed under criminal probation  for five years and paid $7 million in civil and criminal penalties to the federal government after fumbling a case of dumping by a contractor at another Alaska site, Endicott.</p>
        <p>Although BP has said it is not an active party in the heated discussion about development in the refuge, it has donated tens of thousands of dollars to Arctic Power, a group lobbying to open the refuge to drilling, as well as to politicians who support such efforts, including Mr. Bush and the Republican Party.</p>
        <p>''Being 'beyond petroleum' isn't an impossibility, but what on the ground says they are?'' asked Theodore L. Rockwell Jr., who coordinates the Environmental Protection Agency's oil and gas program in Alaska.</p>
        <p>BP built its reputation on exploration and production, first in Iran more than 90 years ago and, over the last generation, in the North Sea and Alaska. Earlier this year, when BP bought the Atlantic Richfield Company, its main rival on the North Slope, it had to sell ARCO's Alaskan fields to Phillips Petroleum in order to receive federal approval for the deal. Phillips produces somewhat more oil, but BP, on a contract basis with other oil concerns, operates most North Slope fields, making it the dominant force in Alaskan oil.</p>
        <p>The company's makeover from a staid British energy empire to a brash maverick that embraced environmentalism is the handiwork of Sir John, the chief executive. A career company man who earned his M.B.A. in the United States and worked in Alaska in the late 1960's, Sir John, 52, has given the 154 business units within BP greater independence while demanding impressive results. He also familiarized himself with research on global warming and said  three years ago that the company should take a stand on the issue, said David Rice, chief of staff for government and public affairs at BP.</p>
        <p>Bucking industry wisdom, BP agreed with the idea that carbon dioxide emissions contribute to global warming and pledged to cut its own emissions by 10 percent by 2010. The company is among the world's largest makers of solar panels and uses solar power at many of its own facilities. It is gradually shifting the emphasis of its exploration and production from crude oil to cleaner-burning natural gas.</p>
        <p>In a letter to employees in July, Sir John wrote that BP's values ''may be manifested in different ways, but they have much in common: a respect for the individual and the diversity of mankind, a responsibility to protect the natural environment.''</p>
        <p>Shareholders take Sir John's message seriously. At the annual meeting on April, 13 percent of shareholders voted for a resolution demanding that BP terminate Northstar and stay out of the refuge, a proportion so high that it stunned company management and even those who introduced the measure.</p>
        <p>''Maybe it is painful for BP to have this degree of scrutiny, but being held accountable will help BP improve its environmental performance over the long run,'' said Simon Billenness, senior analyst at Trillium Asset Management of Boston, one of the sponsors of the resolution.</p>
        <p>The notion of drilling in the coastal plain of the refuge provokes intense debate because of what the opposing sides see at stake. Every summer, thousands of birds from as near as Washington State and as far as Antarctica alight upon the narrow strip of tundra to bear their young. About 150,000 caribou, known as the Porcupine herd, migrate almost 500 miles annually from Canada to calve on the treeless expanse.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot of people who will never go to the refuge, but I get some peace of mind knowing that there is an area of naturalness on such a scale,'' said Fran Mauer, a wildlife biologist with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and an expert on the refuge. ''Where else can you have such herds of caribou, so many bears, oxen roaming?''</p>
        <p>DRILLING proponents say there are about 16 billion barrels in the refuge. But no one knows how much oil is in the coastal plain because very little exploration has been done there. One exploratory well backed by BP and Chevron was drilled years ago on land owned by indigenous peoples within the refuge. BP said the results were a proprietary secret.</p>
        <p>Based on seismic data and information gleaned from oil wells near the refuge, the United States Geological Survey has estimated that technologically recoverable oil in the area is about 7.7 billion barrels. If the area pumped one million barrels a day, it could supply oil to the United States for two decades. In comparison, the great Prudhoe Bay field in the North Slope of Alaska, where BP staked its fortune 30 years ago, had about 9.2 billion barrels.</p>
        <p>Whatever numbers the experts settle on, Greg Gilbert worries that they will draw oil companies into the coastal plain. A member of the 7,500-member Gwich'in Indian nation that lives scattered through the boreal forests of northwest Canada and north central Alaska, Mr. Gilbert hunts caribou to feed his family of seven. Until about 50 years ago, the Gwich'in followed the Porcupine herd in its trek. Now, they live in settlements of one-story clapboard houses heated by wood stoves and often without running water.</p>
        <p>Arctic Village, a settlement outside the southern rim of the refuge, is home to Mr. Gilbert and about 250 other Gwich'in, most of them unemployed, who survive by hunting caribou. Every few hours during one fall day, young men rode down from a nearby ridge in their all-terrain vehicles and unloaded shanks and sides of caribou and moose into their cabins.</p>
        <p>Bundled in a fur hat against the biting wind one afternoon, Mr. Gilbert climbed a rickety 10-foot platform on the edge of a forest of stunted birch and pine and took out binoculars to survey for caribou.</p>
        <p>''Caribou are sensitive,'' Mr. Gilbert said. ''The oil companies want to drill in the refuge, but the elders say the caribou will disappear. They will change their route.''</p>
        <p>He climbed down from the observation platform, and his face was tight with concern. ''I think drilling will eventually happen,'' he said. ''The oil companies have the power to do it. But I worry about the future, my kids, their kids.''</p>
        <p>Opponents of drilling say the refuge could be better protected from development if President Clinton declared the area a national monument. Congress could overturn such a designation, but there is no precedent for doing so.</p>
        <p>BP contends that oil development would not harm caribou, pointing to the thriving herd in the North Slope. A range of independent wildlife biologists dispute BP's argument. Moreover, the coastal plain in the refuge is far smaller than the North Slope but has 10 times the caribou population, which would make it very hard for the animals to avoid oil infrastructure.</p>
        <p>BP says it can develop oil fields on the coastal plain with what it calls  ''minimal'' environmental impact. The acreage that its newest wells occupy, their ''footprint,'' is much smaller than that of older wells, and pipelines are built higher to let caribou pass underneath. Often, there are no roads nearby, and workers are airlifted in.</p>
        <p>Stray caribou roam near the Prudhoe Bay roads that rumble with trucks and pick-ups. Others graze sometimes under pipelines. One bright morning, near the Phillips Alpine field, a flock of geese lifted like a hand from the flat table of the tundra. ''The drive is to do no damage to the environment,'' said Mr. O'Keefe of BP's Alaska Exploration unit, echoing the ''no damage'' theme heard so often in BP offices from London to Anchorage. ''There's no conflict here. The idea runs through all levels of the company.''</p>
        <p>From the spare halls of BP's Alaska headquarters in Anchorage to the bustling company cafeteria in Deadhorse in the North Slope, green-and-yellow posters spread the new environmental gospel: ''Go, Do, Think Beyond.'' ''BP. Bold. Progressive.''</p>
        <p>BUT doubts about the company's environmental mission run deep. In London, wags say the company is Beyond Belief. In Alaska, it is said that workers on the North Slope, many of whom have weathered the harsh tundra and the industry's bad image for more than 20 years, grumble that BP looks weak for going green.</p>
        <p>BP has made sure that its interests are protected. This year, it contributed $50,000 to Arctic Power, the pro-development lobbying group. A BP executive also serves on the board of the group. BP donates to politicians who vote regularly to open the refuge. Moreover, its donations to the Republican Party this year were $613,870 out of its total of $901,796 to political action committees and party organizations, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The company contributed $34,421 to Mr. Bush this year, compared with $4,250 to Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>BP's interest in the refuge reflects its need to keep Alaska output high.  At its peak in 1988, the North Slope produced an average of 2.03 million barrels of oil a day. In 1999, daily output fell to about 1.08 million barrels, according to the state Department of Natural Resources.</p>
        <p>As the Arctic Refuge issues are worked out, BP is looking for rich new reservoirs in the National Petroleum Reserve to the west of its Prudhoe Bay fields, and offshoots of its older developments. So it embarked on Northstar, a 176-million-barrel field that, in the diminishing reservoir of the North Slope, is considered a large find.</p>
        <p>The rig sits on a square, artificial five-acre island in the ocean beyond  barrier islands. Endangered bowhead whales migrate near Northstar, and within the barrier islands two types of threatened sea ducks gather by the thousands every summer before migrating south for the winter.</p>
        <p>When the field is operating fully, 65,000 barrels of crude oil will pass to shore daily through a pipeline buried below the seabed, an engineering first. BP will start drilling this winter, and it is seeking regulatory approval for another offshore well, Liberty, farther to the east of Northstar and closer to the refuge.</p>
        <p>To be able to drill year-round at Northstar, BP must prove to Alaskan officials that it can clean up a spill in the ice-strewn water, should work at Northstar ever go awry. Since last fall, BP has held three clean-up drills, and each time it has failed. In every attempt, the broken ice in the water wrecked or disabled the equipment designed to collect oil. During a test last month, popcorn thrown on the water as a mock spill floated past the clean-up barges, silent testimony to BP's difficulties.</p>
        <p>As a result of the tests, Alaska has placed BP under a compliance order that prohibits the company from drilling at Northstar when the frozen ocean around it has thawed and broken, or from about May to November.</p>
        <p>The company, Alaska officials said, claimed in its plan that it could capture oil when up to 70 percent of the sea is covered with ice. But the state resources department contended that BP had difficulty even where there were trace amounts of ice in the water, based on what its monitors had witnessed.</p>
        <p>''When you can't clean up oil in the Arctic, should you be going in at all?'' asked one federal official who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>Northstar's pipeline is the first to run under the seabed of the Arctic Ocean. In winter, a process called ice scouring occurs in the Arctic, as ice breaks up, smashes together and plows into the sea floor. BP has installed a thick, single-wall pipeline that the company says is buried deep enough to avoid a puncture. The Joint Pipeline Office, a state and federal committee, tested and approved the pipe.</p>
        <p>But other federal officials, environmentalists and an independent expert on pipelines contended that a double-walled pipe would be significantly safer. The draft version of the environmental impact statement gave the BP pipeline about a one-in-four chance of failure. The final version put the odds at 2 to 5 percent.</p>
        <p>Ibrahim Konuk, head of the Canadian research team and a consultant for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service on the environmental impact statement for Liberty, cited concerns based on a lengthy computer modeling project conducted by Canada's Geological Survey on ice scouring and pipelines. ''There's a very good chance that single pipe will fail,'' he said.</p>
        <p>BP and the Joint Pipeline Office say a double-walled pipe would be more complicated, and therefore harder to monitor and repair. The company said it would stick with a single-walled pipe at Liberty.</p>
        <p>BP has excelled in one environmental area: as part of a plea agreement to settle a federal criminal case filed against the company late last year, BP has instituted a nationwide environmental monitoring program at its exploration, drilling and production units to improve oversight and reduce the chance of accidents and spills.</p>
        <p>In 1995, a whistleblower from BP's North Slope Endicott field reported that the contractor for which he was working, Doyon Drilling, had been illegally disposing of hazardous wastes from about 1993 to 1995. Last year, the Justice Department filed the criminal suit and a civil suit against BP. The company, which pleaded guilty to one violation of federal environmental laws, was fined $500,000 in the criminal proceeding and paid $6.5 million to settle the civil suit.</p>
        <p>FEDERAL attorneys in the criminal case against BP contended that the company knew of Doyon's activities but looked the other way -- an accusation that BP denied. In the settlement of the criminal case, BP was placed on probation for five years. The company also volunteered over that period to put into place a stringent nationwide environmental management program at a cost of about $15 million.</p>
        <p>While praising the extra step taken by BP, a federal prosecutor recognized the challenge that the company faces. ''I think folks at their highest levels are committed to environmental issues,'' said Deborah Smith, deputy chief of the environmental crimes section at the Justice Department. ''But does that reach down to their oil rig operator and change the thinking of an oil rig worker who is from an industry that hasn't always been concerned about the environment?''</p>
