        <p>If you like to ponder questions on the scale of how many Web sites can fit on the head of a pin, there is a fine collection of electron microscope images to examine at MicroAngela, an online collection (www.pbrc.hawaii  .edu/bemf/microangela). The Web site is maintained by Tina M. Carvalho, the supervisor at the Biological Electron Microscope Facility at the University of Hawaii in Manoa.</p>
        <p>She has taken the images of tiny bugs, bacteria, mold, parasites and grains of sand, and colored them.</p>
        <p>There is a description for each of the objects, which were collected from captured insects; from samples of ocean life, like tubeworms and coral; and even from mold growing on some Romano cheese in Ms. Carvalho's refrigerator.</p>
