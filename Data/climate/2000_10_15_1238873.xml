        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>You can put this into the category ''You know you're old when . . . ''</p>
        <p>While I was moving my vast record collection to another room, my 3-year-old daughter came across some Snow White records she wanted to listen to. As I pulled the record from the jacket, she exclaimed, ''Daddy, that's a giant CD!'' Steve Dorio</p>
        <p>The cost of heating oil is soaring,</p>
        <p>Icy winds will soon be roaring,</p>
        <p>Minus-20 wind-chill factors,</p>
        <p>Blowing snow on plowing tractors,</p>
        <p>Furnace HIGH to fight the storming</p>
        <p>I need some timely global warming. Bernard Jacks</p>
        <p>One day my friend Alison was responding to her 5-year-old son, Robert, who asked, ''What side of the street do we live on?''</p>
        <p>Alison explained: ''If you're coming down the hill our house is on the left side of the street. However, if you're going up the hill, our house is on the right side of the street.''</p>
        <p>Robert stared in amazement and asked, ''How does the house get from one side of the street to the other?'' Deirdre Flanagan Ward</p>
        <p>Speaking of real estate -- and goofy children's questions . . .</p>
        <p>Another young boy was riding through Franklin Lakes with his grandmother when he noticed a sign on the lawn of a large house.</p>
        <p>''Nana, what does the sign say?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>The grandmother replied, ''The sign reads: 'House for Sale.' ''</p>
        <p>''Really,'' he said. ''Then how do they get it out of the ground?''</p>
        <p>AMORE</p>
        <p>The sycamore is first to feel the fall,</p>
        <p>To shut its chlorophyll production down;</p>
        <p>First to respond to hibernation's call,</p>
        <p>Surrendering its green to brittle brown;</p>
        <p>Surrendering its leaves. Sad sycamore,</p>
        <p>'Reft of its crowning glory, standing bare,</p>
        <p>Its neighbors still in leaf, is metaphor</p>
        <p>For us who've prematurely lost our hair</p>
        <p>And when its buds return and robins sing</p>
        <p>I'm going to the Hair Club in the spring. Bob McKenty</p>
        <p>To prevent the youngsters in a preschool in Pennington from falling from their chairs, I came up with this little reminder:</p>
        <p>Back to back</p>
        <p>Seat to seat</p>
        <p>and . . .</p>
        <p>Six feet on the floor. Eileen Geoghan</p>
        <p>As I was picking up my 4-year-old son Mordechai from nursery school at our local synagogue in Bloomfield, he overheard several other parents wishing me and each other an ''easy fast'' on Yom Kippur.</p>
        <p>As we were driving home, he turned to me and with great excitement said, ''Dad, you should take the turnpike to temple for Yom Kippur.''</p>
        <p>Puzzled, since it was out of the way and completely unnecessary, I asked him why.</p>
        <p>''Because,'' he told me, ''I heard on the radio that the turnpike finally got their easy-fast lanes.''</p>
        <p>TO A JACK-O-LANTERN</p>
        <p>We limn in your skin</p>
        <p>An innocuous grin;</p>
        <p>Plant a candle inside of your head.</p>
        <p>(In a week when you're old</p>
        <p>And succumbing to mold,</p>
        <p>We will wish we had made pies instead.) Bob McKenty</p>
