        <p>In a world where the temperature can change dozens of degrees on a single day, a rise of 1.3 degrees over 100 years might seem inconsequential.

        <p>In a world where the temperature can change dozens of degrees on a single day, a rise of 1.3 degrees over 100 years might seem inconsequential. But an influential panel of earth scientists has concluded that exactly that change has measurably affected ecosystems and physical features of the planet, like alpine glaciers, most notably the vanishing ice cap atop Mt.

        <p>How can such a small change have such big effects? For mountains like Kilimanjaro, at least part of the answer appears straightforward. The altitude at which freezing conditions start has been rising 15 feet a year in the tropics, recent studies find. Sooner or later -- in the Andes, Himalayas and on solitary peaks from Tanzania to Papua New Guinea -- you run out of room for perpetual ice.</p>
        <p>When ice on land melts, the water flows to the sea, producing one of the other relatively simple consequences of a warming trend. Sea levels rise.</p>
        <p>And keep in mind that the average global temperature these days, about 58 degrees, is only 5 to 9 degrees warmer than the average 20,000 years ago, at the peak of the last ice age.</p>
        <p>Last week, the scientists' group, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said the damaging consequences of further warming will come from the extreme weather conditions -- flash floods, droughts and strong storms -- that, collectively, nudge the average toward greater warming. Humans are likely to be able to adapt, the scientists said, but not wildlife, pressed by shifting climate zones and finding escape blocked by cities, pastures and all the other elements of this increasingly human-altered earth.</p>
