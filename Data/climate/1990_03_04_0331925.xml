        <p>LEAD: FRANCIS MARION, AN American general in the Revolutionary War, bedeviled the British with his surprise attacks from the marshy areas of South Carolina. The short, sickly-looking fellow was among our earliest partisan fighters, pioneering guerrilla tactics against regular troops in skirmishes at Tearcoat Swamp and Halfway Swamp.</p>
        <p>FRANCIS MARION, AN American general in the Revolutionary War, bedeviled the British with his surprise attacks from the marshy areas of South Carolina. The short, sickly-looking fellow was among our earliest partisan fighters, pioneering guerrilla tactics against regular troops in skirmishes at Tearcoat Swamp and Halfway Swamp. Because he and his small force would strike and then disappear into seemingly impenetrable bogs, through brambles that tore the red coats of his pursuers, the elusive Marion was given the sobriquet ''the Swamp Fox.''</p>
        <p>Today he would be called the wetlands fox. Swamp is out; this soggy companion of ours for more than three centuries, perhaps from the Greek somphos, ''spongy,'' is considered unscientific and slightly pejorative; the new word put forward by environmentalists and galoshes-equipped journalists is wetlands.</p>
        <p>The Army Corps of Engineers, in chorus with the Environmental Protection Agency, begins to define wetlands as ''those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water.'' But that area must be capable of supporting ''vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions,'' which means plants ranging from cattails and bulrushes to willows and mangroves, which can grow at least part of the time in ground that lacks oxygen. These wetlands include swamps, marshes, wet meadows, wet tundra and bogs.</p>
        <p>As a longtime muckraker, I have been trying to unearth the moment when all this muck was upgraded in our vocabulary. Although wet land, as two words and even one word, has been kicking around for centuries, the first citation in the plural is in The New Scientist of June 17, 1965: ''Wetlands are defined to include marshes, bogs, swamps and any still water less than six meters deep.''</p>
        <p>Twenty years later, the plural word was being construed as both singular and plural: a wetlands is is just as accepted as the wetlands are.</p>
        <p>Last month, a New York Times headline read ''Over E.P.A. Protest, White House Alters Wetland Agreement'' (using the plural wetlands in the copy), while The Washington Post preferred the plural modifier and a zippier style: ''Wetlands Agreement Watered Down.''</p>
        <p>''Twenty years ago,'' says Jon Kusler of the Association of State Wetland [singular]  Managers, ''almost all discussion of wetlands involved waterfalls and fisheries. Now there are concerns for water quality, flood storage, food-chain support and especially birding.''</p>
        <p>How do we wade into the differentiation that will help us make a splash in synonymy? A marsh, a word that may share a root with marine, is wet land characterized by non-woody or herbaceous plants like cattails and similar tall grasses; these include an herb of the mallow family once used in preparing a confection called the marshmallow. (Hardly anybody uses real marshmallow root anymore; only a few old swamp foxes remember the taste.) A mire, from the Old Norse, is synonymous with marsh, but is used more in Europe than in the United States.</p>
        <p>Bog, from the Gaelic word for ''soft,'' is spongy ground that is acidic; that's where gardeners turn for peat moss. The British like the synonyms heath and moor.</p>
        <p>A swamp is land permanently or periodically saturated by water but featuring trees. The term subsumes marshes and bogs, but is not as moist-embracing as wetlands, which spills over to bottomland forests, pocosins, pine savannas and lands that the engineers say ''are not easily recognized, often because they are dry during part of the year or 'they just don't look very wet' from the roadside.''</p>
        <p>What's the opposite of wetlands? No, not drylands -at the E.P.A., it's uplands.</p>
        <p>In a related terminological development, the controversy over the term ground water continues. The water in the ground that supplies wells and springs is written as two words in Webster's New World Dictionary, and as one word in Merriam-Webster's Ninth New Collegiate (because, says its editor, Fred Mish, ''the preponderance of citational evidence shows it as one word'').</p>
        <p>Joe D. Winkle, in 1988 a deputy regional administrator of E.P.A. based in Dallas, sent a memo with 12 pages of attachments to his colleagues in which he complained that ''we are seeing numerous documents presenting groundwater as ground-water or ground water,'' and requested that the two-word style be adopted. This was sent to me by a whistle-blower within the agency with a disgusted notation: ''Our tax dollars at work!''</p>
        <p>Winkle style has been adopted by most bureaucrats at E.P.A., but the single word appears in the agency's news releases. ''Ground water, two words, is what is used in the name of the Office of Ground Water Protection,'' says John Kasper, press aide to chief William K. Reilly, ''but the Ninth New Collegiate uses one word. That's the style I prefer to use in press releases.'' So the ground rule is to use groundwater outside, ground water inside.</p>
        <p>Bogged down in details? Mired by memos? Swamped by work? Try explaining to your with-it boss you've been wetlanded.</p>
        <p>Greenhouse Effect</p>
        <p>PROF. GLENN T. TREWARTHA of the University of Wisconsin wrote in 1937 about ''the so-called greenhouse effect of the atmosphere.'' He was explaining why he thought the earth was growing warmer, and that is the first use of greenhouse effect cited in the Oxford English Dictionary Supplement.</p>
        <p>But note that ''so-called,'' which means that the first use of the phrase came earlier; a scientist who wants to coin a phrase says ''which I call,'' never ''so-called.'' Where, then, did the phrase originate?</p>
        <p>Responding to that query in this space, John B. Wells and Kristi Rasmussen of the Bruce Company in Washington, D.C., note that an earlier term for greenhouse is hothouse. In 1930, the meteorologist W. G. Kendrew wrote a monograph published by the Clarendon Press using this simile: ''The atmosphere may be likened . . . to the glass roof and sides of a hothouse. The glass allows the light rays of the sun to enter, but it obstructs the outward passage of the dark heat, into which the light rays are converted, from the inside that has been warmed by the sunshine.''</p>
        <p>As I get it, shortwave solar radiation penetrates the atmosphere to the earth's surface, where it is transformed into longwaves readily absorbed by carbon dioxide and other gases; that supposedly traps the heat and causes the earth's climate to warm. The theory was first expounded by the physicist John Tyndall in 1861, but he did not clothe it in the catchy greenhouse or hothouse trope.</p>
        <p>The state of the coinage search, then, is: theory by Tyndall, metaphor of the hothouse by Kendrew, change to the greenhouse synonym by Trewartha.</p>
        <p>This brings us to another environmental mystery: who coined global warming?</p>
        <p>That phrase, which became popular in the 80's, has political legs. Senator Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee may ride it to the White House, attracting the support of those who believe that unchecked industrialization could lead to climate disaster. But President Bush, in a speech to clean-air enthusiasts, deliberately avoided the controversial term.</p>
        <p>When a reporter noted that the President did ''not mention the words global warming in his speech today,'' Marlin Fitzwater, White House press secretary, jocularly responded: ''I listened to the speech, and I thought I heard it several times. How did I miss it?'' The reporter pressed that the President said '' 'climate change,' everything but'' global warming. Then came the marshmallow guidance: ''He believes there is a buildup in CO2 that contributes to a phenomenon we don't clearly understand . . . but we are working on it.''</p>
        <p>Global warming is a phrase summarizing an issue that is heating up. This is a want ad for the originator to come forward and stand in the solar radiation.</p>
