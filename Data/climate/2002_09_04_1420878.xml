        <p>UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 3 Â— A lot of countries at the United Nations are mad at the United States these days.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>A lot of countries at the United Nations are mad at the United States these days.</p>
        <p>They are worried about the ''regime change'' that the Bush administration has in mind for Iraq and frustrated that Washington balked at treaties on global warming and an international court for war criminals.</p>
        <p>But that did not stop the organization from radically changing its schedule for this year's General Assembly to accommodate New York's plans for commemorating Sept. 11.</p>
        <p>At the request of the United States, the general debate, the part of the assembly session featuring speeches by world leaders, has been moved forward by almost two weeks to Sept. 12, so that President Bush can deliver a major address one day after he participates in the Sept. 11 events.</p>
        <p>The schedule change will also allow heads of state and other senior dignitaries to join in the Sept. 11 anniversary and then move to the gathering at the United Nations.</p>
        <p>To make the new plan fit with other United Nations activities, the General Assembly also agreed to curtail the time for speech-making in the debate from the traditional 10 days over a two-week period, to 8 days over a 9-day period.</p>
        <p>Diplomats accustomed to endless tangled negotiations at the United Nations said the talks on the schedule change were pleasantly straightforward. Despite tensions over other matters, there remains a reserve of good will for the United States and New York City on issues related to the terrorist attacks last year.</p>
        <p>Joon Oh, a senior official on the staff of the General Assembly president, Han Seung Soo of South Korea, said, ''The member states of the United Nations were very understanding and supportive of the idea.''</p>
        <p>Many United Nations diplomats experienced the shock of Sept. 11 in person. Last year, the General Assembly was scheduled to begin on Sept. 11. The headquarters building on First Avenue was shut down and evacuated.</p>
        <p>The general debate, which traditionally begins two weeks after the session opens and last year was supposed to start on Sept. 25, was postponed until November.</p>
        <p>Discussions on combating terrorism dominated the assembly's deliberations for the rest of the year. Negotiations for a convention against terrorism are under way.</p>
        <p>In 2000, the general debate schedule was changed to make way for a huge millennium summit meeting. But officials and librarians here could not recall another occasion when the General Assembly's plans were shifted forward at the request of a single country.</p>
        <p>The General Assembly was not ready to make the new schedule permanent. The document approving the changes explicitly states that they do not set any precedent for the future.</p>
