        <p>Inching Toward a Climate Pact  Negotiators for more than 150 countries meeting in Kyoto, Japan, tried to come to an agreement on the reduction of heat-trapping greenhouse gases by industrialized nations. They focused on a proposal put forth by the Argentine chairman of the talks that would cut emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases 5 percent below 1990 levels for the period 2005 through 2010.</p>

        <p>New Uproar Over German Army  Defense Minister Volker Ruhe of Germany suspended the commander of an elite military academy in Hamburg after it became known that Manfred Roeder, a neo-Nazi who went to prison for his involvement in a racist attack, had given a lecture there in 1995. The information set off an uproar in the Defense and Foreign Ministries.</p>

        <p>Britain Ponders Health Reform  The Government of Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain presented to the House of Commons its proposals to overhaul the National Health Service, the country's 49-year-old system of socialized medicine. The Government allocated no new money but urged reducing red tape and giving more power to the country's 35,000 general practitioners.</p>

        <p>Branson's Balloon Goes it Alone  The huge helium balloon of Richard Branson, the British adventurer, floated away from Marrakesh, Morocco, without its three-man crew, who had hoped to become the first balloonists to fly around the world. The balloon drifted between Morocco and Algeria as Mr. Branson implored those countries' air forces to shoot the balloon down.</p>

        <p>Iranian Leader Berates U.S.  Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, told guests at a world Islamic summit in Teheran that the main threat to security in the Middle East was ''the poisonous breath'' of the United States and its presence in the Persian Gulf. His speech elicited only polite applause from the dozens of heads of state and top officials at the Organization of the Islamic Conference.</p>

        <p>Albright: West Shares Blame  In Ethiopia on the first leg of her weeklong tour of Africa, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said that the United States and other nations shared the blame for the recent genocidal atrocities in central Africa. She said the West waited too long to respond to Hutu killings of Tutsi in Rwanda in 1994 that left 500,000 people dead. Some Hutu, she said, rearmed themselves from United Nations refugee camps operated at a cost of $1 million a day.</p>

        <p>Freeh and Reno Talk But Give Few Answers  Louis J. Freeh, the F.B.I. Director, indicated to a House panel that he might agree to provide more details about a memorandum he wrote to Attorney General Janet Reno urging her to appoint an independent prosecutor to investigate campaign fund-raising. Both Mr. Freeh and Ms. Reno appeared before the committee, but they refused to answer specific questions about the substance of their disagreement over the need for an independent counsel.</p>

        <p>The American public is sharply divided over whether an independent counsel should be appointed to investigate 1996 Democratic fund-raising activities, according to a New York Times/CBS News Poll.</p>

        <p>John Doe No. 2 in Bomb Trial  Lawyers for Terry L. Nichols, left, charged with murder and conspiracy in the 1995 bombing that killed 168 people, are attempting to bring John Doe No. 2, who may not exist, and the people who say they saw him to center stage in an effort to cast doubt on the prosecution's case.</p>

        <p>New Car-Lease Protections  New Federal rules on car leasing, to take effect in 1998, will require dealers to give car buyers basic information about costs and other terms of leasing, allowing consumers to compare different leases or decide that they might be better off purchasing instead. The rules are intended to address abuses like failing to be credited by dealers for down-payments, trade-ins or rebates.</p>

        <p>Constitution and Car Chases  The Supreme Court heard arguments on whether a high-speed police chase that results in accidental -- although perhaps foreseeable -- injury or death violates the Constitution. A lawyer for a California sheriff's deputy said the deputy should be immune from a damage suit brought by the family of a 16-year-old motorcycle passenger who died in 1990 when the deputy's patrol car skidded into him after a motorcycle chase at speeds of up to 100 m.p.h.</p>

        <p>Hospitals Reject Mentally Ill  Two-thirds of the nation's private hospitals that are equipped to take mentally ill patients dump them on financially strapped public hospitals and community services, said a study to be published in the journal Health Services Research.</p>

        <p>Clue to Fraudulent Story  A clue that M. Larry Lawrence had invented his heroic World War II record lay in his State Department file in 1993, but investigators apparently overlooked it during the vetting process following his nomination to be ambassador to Switzerland. In the file was Mr. Lawrence's University of Arizona transcript, which included a notation that he had earned college credits in 1944 and '45. But Mr. Lawrence said he had been injured in March 1945, while serving on a United States merchant marine ship in the Arctic Ocean.</p>

        <p>Boeing to Change Design Because of T.W.A. Crash  In an effort to prevent explosions like the one that caused the crash of Trans World Airlines Flight 800, Boeing officials said that the design of the company's jetliners needed to be changed to guard against the build-up of flammable fumes. Although the cause of the explosion on the Boeing 747 has still not been determined, the company's statement was a clear departure from a 40-year-old principle of commercial aviation design. Boeing said that it was now researching possible ways of reducing the accumulation of dangerous vapors in fuel tanks.</p>

        <p>F.B.I. Official to Retire  James K. Kallstrom, 54, the F.B.I. official in New York who tracked down terrorists, mobsters, and swindlers but who will probably be best remembered for his criminal inquiry into the explosion that blew apart Trans World Airlines Flight 800, said he will retire from the bureau to become an executive at the MBNA Corporation, the nation's No. 2 credit card company after Citicorp. F.B.I. officials refused to comment on Mr. Kallstrom's successor.</p>
