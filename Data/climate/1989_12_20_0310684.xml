        <p>LEAD: As the 44th United Nations General Assembly moves toward a close, the American representative, Thomas R. Pickering, described the session today as ''one of the most constructive and realistic within memory'' and said it had promoted a ''nondogmatic approach'' to world problems.</p>
        <p>As the 44th United Nations General Assembly moves toward a close, the American representative, Thomas R. Pickering, described the session today as ''one of the most constructive and realistic within memory'' and said it had promoted a ''nondogmatic approach'' to world problems.</p>
        <p>At a news conference called to give the United States view, Mr. Pickering described the Bush Administration as ''pleased not only with the accomplishments of the 44th session'' but also with ''the positive signals'' it has sent about prospects for resolving world conflicts, jointly addressing problems no country can solve alone and carrying out agreed United Nations changes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pickering's assessment was broadly similar to that offered last week by Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir F. Petrovsky of the Soviet Union, who said the Assembly has ''moved beyond ideology'' into ''the post-confrontational world.'' Earlier this week, Maj. Gen. Joseph N. Garba of Nigeria, the General Assembly's President, said ''a new constructive and cooperative spirit'' is abroad in the world.</p>
        <p>All three attributed the Assembly's positive tone this year to reduced superpower tension, a recognition that many problems require cooperative solutions and the Soviet Union's new interest in the United Nations. On Drug Trafficking</p>
        <p>Summarizing what he called the session's more positive achievements, Mr. Pickering mentioned record support for Israel's membership as well as record or unanimous support for resolutions barring the Khmer Rouge from sole power in Cambodia and calling for peace in Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>He also listed the unanimous agreement on an action program against drug trafficking, the agreed ban on drift net fishing, a declaration of guiding principles for South Africa's shift away from apartheid and the likelihood that a consensus will be reached before the Assembly ends Friday on steps to protect the world from climate change On what he referred to as the negative side, Mr. Pickering listed the ''unbalanced'' resolutions adopted on the Middle East, the Arabs' attempt to get the Palestine Liberation Organization recognized as the government of a proclaimed Palestinian state and a third-world campaign to weaken human rights enforcement by increasing the size of the Human Rights Commission.</p>
        <p>Most delegates agreed that this 44th General Assembly was a turning point in United Nations history, with a sharp decline in ideological confrontation and a new search to unanimity on critical global questions. Nevertheless, many called the American assesment optimistic and said it ignored dangers of America's own making now facing the organization. British Effort Blocked</p>
        <p>A common observation, glossed over in the American assessment, is that better superpower relations have coincided with an upsurge in North-South tension in the world.</p>
        <p>At this year's Assembly, developing countries blocked a British-led effort at reorganizing the United Nations economic and social agencies. Under Chinese leadership they called for the world organization to stop criticizing governments for human rights abuses, saying this constitutes interference in internal affairs. They also fought aggressively to secure economic concessions in return for cooperating on environmental and other issues.</p>
        <p>Such resurgent North-South tensions have aroused fears that the industrialized powers might eventually tire of trying to win third world backing for environmental and other projects they favor and press ahead alone outside the United Nations framework.</p>
        <p>The upbeat American view, critics also contend, takes no account of the bitter feelings left by the Bush Administration's threat to withhold future contributions to the United Nations if the Assembly upgraded the P.L.O.'s representation, at a time when it owes the organization more than $500 million in unpaid dues. On Zionism Resolution</p>
        <p>Neither does it reflect the apprehension aroused by Vice President Dan Quayle's sudden announcement that the United States will seek to repeal a General Assembly resolution passed in 1975 that equates Zionism with racism.</p>
        <p>The Soviet Union has come out publicly against the proposal, calling it divisive. And many Western countries think repeal impossible without a breakthrough in the Middle East peace process. But they fear that Congress will engineer a confrontation with the United Nations next year by threatening to withold funds unless the Assembly cancels the Zionism resolution.</p>
        <p>This has led to bitter accusations that the United States wants to extend its Security Council veto into the General Assembly's debates by warning it may cut back funds if it does not get its way.</p>
