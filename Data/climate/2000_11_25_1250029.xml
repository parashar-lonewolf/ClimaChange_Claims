        <p>Chinese Migrants in Taiwan Seen as a Security Risk  A swelling wave of mainland Chinese are trying to sneak into Taiwan to work, even as the two governments formally refuse to speak to each other. Perhaps 40,000 mainlanders are in Taiwan illegally, and some Taiwan officials worry that they pose a threat to national security.</p>

        <p>Mideast Security Link Kept  Prime Minister Ehud Barak and the Palestinian leader, Yassir Arafat, spoke by telephone and agreed to maintain field-level security links that Israel had threatened to sever a day earlier. The unexpected conversation was engineered by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who was meeting with Mr. Arafat in Moscow in what was widely seen as the Russian leader's first serious foray into Middle Eastern peacemaking.</p>

        <p>Struggling for a Consensus  Negotiators met behind guarded doors in The Hague as they tried to reach a consensus on a global warming treaty before their meeting breaks up today. ''For the environment, it doesn't get any bigger than this,'' said Jennifer Morgan, the climate change specialist for the World Wildlife Fund.</p>

        <p>Presidential Election Battle Goes to U.S. SupremeCourt  The United States Supreme Court unexpectedly placed itself in the middle of Florida's presidential vote-counting imbroglio, ordering arguments next Friday in Gov. George W. Bush's appeal from the Florida Supreme Court's ruling that permitted manual recounts to continue beyond the state's deadline for certifying election returns.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Florida's Republican-led Legislature announced plans to join Mr. Bush's Supreme Court challenge to hand recounts, and Vice President Al Gore's campaign fought back with promises of its own lawsuits to be filed next week in the Democrats' expanding legal contest of the election.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore plans to contest the election results in Palm Beach County on the grounds that confusion over the ''butterfly'' ballot cost him thousands of votes there, senior Democratic lawyers and strategists said.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has begun an aggressive drive to rally prominent members of his party behind him, trying to ensure that his political support does not collapse as some Democrats express doubts about his extended drive for the White House.</p>

        <p>Dick Cheney went home from the hospital two days after suffering his fourth heart attack in 22 years, saying that his doctors assured him that they had found no health reasons that would prevent him from serving as vice president or president.</p>

        <p>A Symbol of Church's Tensions  A vist by Anglican bishops from South America, Africa and Australia on Sunday to a church in Rosemont, Pa., symbolizes tensions over questions of biblical interpretation, the leadership role of women and, especially, how to relate to gays in the pews that have arisen between leaders of the 2.4 million-member Episcopal Church and some of their more conservative counterparts in the global Anglican Communion.</p>

        <p>Police Having Trouble Attracting Enough Recruits  Murders in New York City have been cut by nearly two-thirds since their peak in 1990 and violent crime over all has fallen to levels not seen since the 1960's. Families are moving in to a city they regard as safe and revitalized. But despite this sensational success story, a more troubling tale is quietly unfolding within the Police Department: The number of officers leaving the force, including scores of its most senior supervisors, is surging. And the difficulty in attracting recruits for the 41,000-officer department has become acute.</p>

        <p>Brick Attack Trial Nears End  With testimony approaching an end in the trial of a man charged with smashing a woman's head with a brick, a Manhattan jury will have to weigh conflicting accounts of witnesses and decide how much to rely on two jailhouse informants who said the man had suggested to them that he was involved in the attack, which occurred on a busy Midtown sidewalk last November.</p>

        <p>An Icon Under Siege  The reputation of Winston Churchill, who never enjoyed the same unqualified adulation at home as in America, is under renewed assault, in part because of an acrimonious debate among British scholars and political figures about whether he should have tried to negotiate a compromise peace with Hitler.</p>

        <p>Shopping for Bargains  Stocks rallied in a holiday-shortened session, with the Nasdaq composite index jumping 5.4 percent while the Dow Jones industrial average climbed just 0.7 percent. Buyers appeared to jump in to pick up bargains, especially in the technology sector, after sharp selling recently. But the biggest worry for investors is the outlook for that sector, which is threatening to lead the market's major indexes toward their worst year in decades.</p>
