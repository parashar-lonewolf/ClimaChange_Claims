        <p>JAPAN often seems devoid of ideological debate in public, but deep in its bureaucracy a major ideological battleground remains: School textbooks.</p>
        <p>The country's powerful Education Ministry, which sets a uniform tone for schools across the land, never fails to stir arguments when it goes through its exhaustive screening of the content of the texts used in every Japanese schoolhouse. For decades, the ministry and academics have argued about how to depict Japan's actions in World War II -- whether, for example, to refer to the "advance" into China as an "invasion," and whether it was the "Nanjing incident" or the "Nanjing massacre." Those disagreements, more than any other, are cited by Japan's one-time enemies, especially in Asia, as evidence that the country is still unable to come to terms with its history of aggression.</p>

        <p>JAPAN often seems devoid of ideological debate in public, but deep in its bureaucracy a major ideological battleground remains: School textbooks.</p>
        <p>The country's powerful Education Ministry, which sets a uniform tone for schools across the land, never fails to stir arguments when it goes through its exhaustive screening of the content of the texts used in every Japanese schoolhouse. For decades, the ministry and academics have argued about how to depict Japan's actions in World War II -- whether, for example, to refer to the "advance" into China as an "invasion," and whether it was the "Nanjing incident" or the "Nanjing massacre." Those disagreements, more than any other, are cited by Japan's one-time enemies, especially in Asia, as evidence that the country is still unable to come to terms with its history of aggression.</p>
        <p>But the war tends to overshadow the more mundane ways in which modern-day Japanese politics influences the writing of Japanese textbooks. For decades, school textbooks have been used as an instrument for developing social consensus, and advancing the Government's view of the world. Other societies also regulate the political climate of the classroom, but in Japan the practice has been honed to an art, in which the Education Ministry offers "guidance" (sometimes subtle, sometimes not) over how to define the most delicate issues of the day.</p>
        <p>The practice has a long history. Before World War II the texts were often ultra-nationalist in content and tone. After the war, while American occupation forces ran Japan, the influence of the censors declined. But after the formation of the Liberal Democratic Party in 1955, notes Masami Yamazumi, a professor at Tokyo Metropolitan University, "textbook screening became more rigorous, a tool to endorse Government policy."</p>
        <p>Some textbooks, for example, include a Government-approved map that shows Japan as owner of four northern islands that were seized by the Soviet Union 47 years ago and that figure today in a demand that Russia return them before relations can be normalized. An Admiral Resurrected</p>
        <p>And the Education Ministry recently "suggested" that 42 historical figures be included in the textbooks to "enhance respect for Japanese culture and tradition" -- among them Adm. Heihachiro Togo, victor in the Russo-Japanese war. For the late admiral, it was quite a revival: At one time he jammed the pages of Japanese school texts, but for the last 40 years he had been all but banned, a symbol of militarism.</p>
        <p>True, the textbooks also reflect the national mood to some extent, but sometimes even this mood is invoked to political effect. With Japanese troops going abroad for the first time as members of United Nations peacekeeping teams, the textbook publishers are being directed to tell their readers about the "growing acceptance of the Self-Defense Forces" although several also refer to the continuing doubts about whether the force is constitutional. Publishers Grumble</p>
        <p>Under pressure to lift the veil of secrecy that has long surrounded textbook editing, the ministry has begun to make public its requests for "revisions." It has also greatly reduced the number of "mandatory revisions" after reviewing manuscripts. This year the most changes it sought in one book was 76, compared to 477 in the last review, in 1985.</p>
        <p>But publishers still complain. "It's just an impression that the ministry is easing off," said Hiroo Kimura of the Japan Federation of Publishers. "But textbook approval is still used to advance Government agendas."</p>
        <p>Here are some examples of how passages dealing with sensitive subjects in secondary school texts were submitted and changed, for inclusion in the new texts Japanese students will receive when their next school year begins, in April. What They Might Have Said . . . and What They Did</p>
        <p>Foreign Aid As Written: "Japan's O.D.A.  programs  [ even in Japanese-language texts, foreign aid in Japan is known as O.D.A., for Overseas Development Assistance ]  are criticized on the grounds that they lead to destruction of the environment and of people's life styles. . . .  and that they benefit the advancement of Japanese companies into the donor countries more than the donor country itself." The Ministry Suggestion: "The grasp of the problems relating to O.D.A. is one-sided." After Revision: "Japanese O.D.A. is provided to developing countries for the construction of roads, bridges, ports and other public works, and for insurance and medical services. More recently, O.D.A. has also been used for environmental protection programs and for technical assistance projects. However, compared with other developed countries, the percentage of grant aid that Japan provides to developing countries is small." -- "Japanese Society and the World," published by Shimizu Shoin. Relations With Neighbors Pre-1992 Textbook: "We must not forget that Japan caused inconvenience to neighboring Asian countries in the past." The Ministry Suggestion: After protests from China and Korea, the Government has made it clear it wants descriptions of Japan's war responsibility toughened, as Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu did in referring to "unbearable suffering" during a speech in Singapore in May 1991. Revised Textbook: "We must not forget that Japan caused unbearable suffering to neighboring nations in the past." -- "The New Social Studies," published by Tokyoshoseki. Nuclear Power As Written: "Some see nuclear power as a viable alternative energy source to oil. But there are still many unresolved issues such as safety and the problem of radioactive waste disposal, with each country now giving careful consideration to postponing or discontinuing the construction of new nuclear power plants." The Ministry Suggestion: "Take into consideration the pros and cons of nuclear power generation. . . . Point out that each country has differing policies on nuclear power plant construction." (The Government has found that public fears have made it virtually impossible to get Japanese cities and towns to agree to the construction of new nuclear power plants.) After Revision: "Nuclear power generation is seen to be an effective alternative fuel source because it does not emit carbon monoxide, considered to be a cause of the greenhouse effect. However, issues such as safety and the problem of radioactive waste disposal still remain. Although some countries are actively pursuing nuclear power policies, the number of countries which are abandoning or postponing nuclear power is increasing." -- "High School Social Studies," published by Kyoikushuppan. Social Welfare As Written: "All citizens when faced with the possibility of poverty may receive, without being questioned on the reasons for the circumstances, without discrimination, equal protection of a reasonable livelihood under the law. However, even when faced with such dire circumstances as poverty, there is such a thing as 'suitability provisions,' in other words, an assets test. The officers at the local social welfare offices demand an excessive amount of paperwork and personal investigations in order to meet the Ministry of Health and Welfare's stringent requirements. It is just one ploy to make people give up applying. In Tokyo's Arakawa ward in December of 1988, an elderly woman was forced to give up her social security benefits, and committed suicide. 'Even if I were to live again, I'd never want to be on social welfare. You told me to die, so I will,' " said the bitter protest letter she left behind." (An excerpt taken from a scholarly work, 'What Is Quality of Life?') The Ministry Suggestion: The "passage is unsuitable for textbooks because it takes a one-sided view, and there are inconsistencies in the facts behind the real story." (Japan's Health and Welfare Ministry asserts it received a letter of gratitude from the same woman.) As Published: The passage was omitted. -- "Junior High School Social Studies," published by Nihonshoseki.</p>
