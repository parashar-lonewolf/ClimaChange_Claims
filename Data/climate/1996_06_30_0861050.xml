        <p>IT would not be surprising for the first new office building to go up in mid-Manhattan in many years to incorporate a few new wrinkles. But the Durst Organization, which is scheduled to break ground this summer for a 48-story tower on Broadway between 42d and 43d Streets, is emphasizing an attribute not commonly associated with the Times Square area: environmentalism.</p>
        <p>The building, whose address will be 4 Times Square, will include energy efficient heating and cooling, increased use of natural light, internal chutes to collect materials for recycling, tightly fitted windows and extra insulation, water conservation fixtures and measures to avoid the use of materials that release toxic gases to interior air.</p>
        <p>Durst officials say the emphasis on green virtues produces a double benefit: A pleasant interior space is attractive to prospective tenants, and careful attention to conservation actually saves money, despite somewhat higher initial  costs.</p>
        <p>"Being environmentally responsible is a part of our lifestyle," said Douglas  Durst, president of the Durst Organization. "We were pleased to learn that the economics made sense as well." He said the energy costs of the building will be  25 to 30 percent below those of the office buildings built in the 1980's, and 15 to 20 percent better than the government standards currently in effect.</p>
        <p>The lower costs will be passed on to tenants to make the building more attractive, said Jonathan (Jody) Durst, the organization's chief of operations.</p>
        <p>The publishing company Conde Nast will be the anchor tenant, occupying one third of the building's 1.5 million square feet of office space. (There will be  an additional 100,000 square feet of retail space on the first three floors.) Charles H. Townsend, Conde Nast's executive in charge of the relocation, said he was drawn to the building's green benefits and planned to build its space following environmental principles.</p>
        <p>"The tenant benefits from a green building," Mr. Townsend said. "The Dursts supply us with high quality air and low noise levels. It is our intention to carry on the environmental theme in the build-out and furnishing of our space."</p>
        <p>He said the effort would focus on adhesives, paints, carpeting and wall coverings because these are the things often responsible for releasing volatile  gases that are associated with "sick building syndrome,"in which workers complain of headaches and other illnesses caused by polluted air. Even the basic layout of the space may be unconventional to promote maximum use of natural light.</p>
        <p>"We are at the expression of interest stage, but we would be highly receptive to an approach that made maximum use of outdoor light," Mr. Townsend said. In a  typical layout, executive offices ring the exterior of a floor, blocking the light for clerical workers in the interior.</p>
        <p>WITH a different layout, more workers would benefit from natural light, which is easier on the eyes than artificial lighting. Special glass will be used on the building to admit natural light but reject ultraviolet rays, which tend to drive up temperatures.</p>
        <p>Until recently, the chief proponents of green building were, not surprisingly, environmental groups. When the Natural Resources Defense Council remodeled the top four floors of 40 West 20th Street in 1988, it did so with an  eye toward energy conservation.</p>
        <p>Instruments that detect motion turn off lights in unoccupied rooms and natural light is conveyed to the interior of the structure by using glass on the top of interior partition walls. An etched glass wall on one side of the conference room there minimizes the use of artificial light, even though it is at the middle of the space, because outside light passes through the wall.</p>
        <p>"The total energy bill here is $35,000 a year," said Robert Watson, a senior  resource specialist with the group. "If it was a conventional office, it would be over $100,000."</p>
        <p>He said the conversion was more expensive than a standard approach, but attributed the extra expense mostly to the learning curve. "There was a bit of tuition, a certain cost of learning how to do it," he said. "But if we did it again, it would be no more costly." The group spent about $200,000, or about 7 percent of the $3.1 million project on energy conservation features such as motion sensors that turn light out in unoccupied rooms and low watt fluorescent  specially coated to resemble daylight.</p>
        <p>William Browning of the Rocky Mountain Institute, a research group in Colorado, said at a recent conference in New York that energy efficient building, using parts and equipment now available, should cost no more than 5 percent more to build than the standard approach.</p>
        <p>The Audubon Society achieved similar energy savings when it remodeled a 100-year-old, eight-story building at Broadway and East Fourth Street several years later.  "Our energy costs are about $86,000 to $87,000 a year," said Ken Hamilton, the building's manager. Standard industry guidelines for such a building in this climate zone predict costs of $120,000 to $140,000 a year, he said.</p>
        <p>Interest in environmentally correct buildings is growing nationally, said David Gottfried, the founder and vice chairman of the U.S. Green Buildings Council in San Francisco. "I've been into green building since 1990, but now interest seems to be heating up," he said.</p>
        <p>He said the council, which has 110 members including equipment suppliers, universities, utilities and environmental groups, is developing a rating system  for buildings. "Buildings get rated in the United Kingdom and Canada, but we've  had nothing here, Mr. Gottfried said. "When we publish our rating system, it could start to affect leasability and rental rates if the tenant community picks up on it."</p>
        <p>Mr. Townsend of Conde Nast said one of the attractions of 4 Times Square was  the air handling system, which will measure air quality as well as temperature.  The concentration of carbon dioxide in the air will be continually monitored, and when it rises above a pre-set point, more fresh air will be circulated inside.</p>
        <p>The carbon dioxide level is a proxy for all the contaminants that can foul indoor air, including emissions from office machines and solutions used in cleaning, said Barry Dimson, president of Health Properties L.L.C., a consulting company in New York.</p>
        <p>"Ninety-nine percent of the systems run on temperature alone, so there is no  way to measure as the volatile organic compounds build up," Mr. Dimson said. "By 2 P.M. the air in some of these buildings is not very good."</p>
        <p>And, he said, most buildings turn their air-conditioning systems off at night, when cleaning crews are using various chemicals as part of their work. The ones that evaporate thus stay in the air until the system is turned on again in the morning. "The eager guy who comes in at 8 A.M. gets quite a jolt," Mr. Dimson said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dimson said he expects the Durst building to stimulate interest in an environmentally better workplace. "Brokers do not like to talk about air quality but soon they will have to because their clients will ask," he said. "Already some law firms are starting to ask questions because of what they see in their own practices."</p>
        <p>The Durst building will include two chutes to promote recycling, one for wet  trash, such as the remains of a lunch, and one for the waste paper that offices  generate in vast amounts. Both chutes will lead directly to compactors, which will prepare the garbage for disposal and the paper for recycling.</p>
        <p>Collection of cans and bottles will be handled on a floor by floor basis, Jody Durst said, because the volume is much less than paper and more shafts would reduce rentable space.</p>
        <p>SAVING in energy costs and carbon dioxide levels in interior air are easy to  measure, but green building advocates say the big advantages are less easy to quantify: more productive employees.</p>
        <p>Several studies have suggested that a healthy work environment boosts productivity by about 10 percent, by reducing the number of sick days taken off  and improving people's attitudes. If the average office worker in New York costs $40,000 a year and occupies about 200 square feet of space, that means the employer's cost is about $200 per square foot per person.</p>
        <p>A 10 percent increase in productivity would produce a $20 a square foot increase in rental value.</p>
        <p>"Eighty percent of most employers' costs are for personnel," Douglas Durst said. "If you reduce absenteeism in an environmentally friendly building, it can have a big payoff."</p>
