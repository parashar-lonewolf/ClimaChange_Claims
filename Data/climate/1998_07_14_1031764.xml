        <p>The letter was handwritten on lined dime-store paper, suggesting a homespun spontaneity. ''Entire forests are dying from disease,'' a Long Island teacher wrote. ''If you press hard for acid rain legislation in this session of Congress, I may never have to teach anything more than the beauty and wonders of nature!''</p>
        <p>But the note was actually one of thousands written quite unspontaneously at the behest of environmental groups last spring. And like the paper plates bearing messages from immigrants, the postcards from people with AIDS and the phone calls from opponents of smoking, they were part of well-coordinated efforts to influence one man: Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the Long Island Republican.</p>
        <p>No stranger to the high-priced lobbying of powerful interest groups, Mr. D'Amato opens himself to less-familiar pressure groups come election time. He has been getting an earful of low-budget advocacy these days from nonprofit organizations representing immigrants, environmentalists, tenants, gay people and a bevy of other constituencies better known for their ties to New York Democrats.</p>
        <p>With phone and letter campaigns, news conferences and newsletters, the groups are training laserlike attention on Mr. D'Amato this year, hoping that election-year pressures will cause him to push harder and shout louder on issues he might have ignored or opposed were he not seeking votes. Mr. D'Amato, considered one of the Senate's most vulnerable incumbents, is seeking his fourth term this year.</p>
        <p>''Everybody who I've talked to who knows him said, 'You know, this is your best year,' '' said William Cooke, legislative director for the Citizens Campaign for the Environment, which is urging Mr. D'Amato to push acid rain legislation. ''Every six years, he's an environmentalist.''</p>
        <p>It might seem pointless for groups with traditionally liberal agendas to focus on a man who revels in labeling challengers ''hopelessly liberal.'' But such organizations have clearly reaped some benefits from their efforts. With his bloodhound's nose for populist themes, Mr. D'Amato is more moderate, and malleable, near election time than his hard-edge campaign oratory suggests, officials with several groups said.</p>
        <p>''He's much more amenable at election time,'' said a Washington lobbyist for a civil rights group, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ''People joke that in an election year, D'Amato is better than most Democrats. He'll be there, because he's seeking votes.''</p>
        <p>His ties to centrist and liberal pressure groups have also been useful to Mr. D'Amato. Such alliances have allowed him to say he is fighting against conservative Republicans for regular New Yorkers, and not just for wealthy campaign contributors or big companies.</p>
        <p>And when Mr. D'Amato has delivered, he has received the desired accolades from groups that have often criticized him or his party. Late last year, for instance, the New York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition, one of the state's largest tenants' groups, praised Mr. D'Amato for defending Federal housing subsidies for the poor. The same group had sharply attacked Mr. D'Amato earlier last year for supporting a rollback of rent protections.</p>
        <p>But his critics and Democratic rivals accuse Mr. D'Amato of nimble-footed opportunism, saying he champions liberal and centrist causes solely to court swing voters and to whitewash what they consider a distinctly conservative voting record.</p>
        <p>''He's masquerading as a new-found environmentalist,'' said Chris Ballantyne, Northeast regional director for the Sierra Club, which has run television advertisements criticizing Mr. D'Amato this year.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. D'Amato bridled at suggestions that he has shifted leftward this year, insisting that most of his current positions are not new. ''They are matters of conscience,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But he acknowledged feeling additional pressure from grass-roots lobbyists in recent months. ''Some groups become impatient,'' he said. ''They think that because there is an election, they will get you to do more or less. But I work as hard as I can all the time.''</p>
        <p>Still, pressure tactics may have influenced the Senator more than he admits. In one case, Mr. D'Amato voted in May for a Democratic amendment to raise cigarette taxes by $1.50 a pack after facing fierce lobbying from health care and consumer groups. In the past, he has voted against such tax increases.</p>
        <p>''We made a significant effort to focus on D'Amato,'' said Joan Mulhern, co-chairwoman of the Save Lives, Not Tobacco Coalition. ''Tobacco control is a big issue for some of his Democratic opponents, so we thought it was an issue he would be sensitive on.''</p>
        <p>In part because they knew he would be embroiled in a tough re-election campaign, advocates for immigrants also made Mr. D'Amato a major target this year in their fight to reinstate food stamp benefits for legal immigrants. The groups mailed hundreds of paper plates containing scribbled messages from immigrants to Mr. D'Amato -- who often supports immigrants on other issues -- hoping that the appeal of potential Hispanic and Asian voters would turn his head.</p>
        <p>Though he did not press this issue as hard as some groups hoped, Mr. D'Amato spoke in favor of the measure and joined a bipartisan group that helped break a Senate deadlock, paving the way for the bill's passage.</p>
        <p>''Around the country, people were trying to focus on D'Amato'' on the immigrant food stamp issue, said Liz Krueger, associate director of the Community Food Resources Center in New York City. ''One, because he represents New York, with a whole lot of immigrants. Two, because he is up for election and seems to be willing to do anything to get votes at home, not to be too cynical about it.''</p>
        <p>For similar reasons, patient advocates are planning to lobby Mr. D'Amato later this summer on legislation intended to increase consumer protections in managed-care plans. Though Mr. D'Amato has sponsored such legislation, he has not pushed hard enough for its passage, the groups say.</p>
        <p>The groups plan to flood his office with phone calls and letters, and will also try, they say, to shame him into action by publicizing his campaign contributions from health insurance companies.</p>
        <p>''It helps that there are three Democrats who are actively campaigning on this,'' said Richard Kirsch, executive director of Citizen Action of New York, a nonprofit government watchdog group active in health care issues.</p>
        <p>The three Democrats seeking the nomination to challenge Mr. D'Amato are Geraldine A. Ferraro, the former candidate for vice president; Mark Green, the New York City Public Advocate, and Representative Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn and Queens.</p>
        <p>For Mr. D'Amato, there are some obvious risks in advocating legislation that other Republicans strongly oppose. Success can annoy his Senate allies, while failure can disappoint and anger the grass-roots groups he is courting.</p>
        <p>For instance, at the urging of environmental groups, Mr. D'Amato and his Democratic counterpart, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, introduced legislation last year intended to curb the airborne pollutants that cause acid rain.</p>
        <p>The groups cheered him at the time, and Mr. D'Amato began broadcasting television advertisements just weeks later touting his environmentalism.</p>
        <p>But the bill has been stuck in committee, and the environmentalists have begun complaining loudly that Mr. D'Amato is doing nothing to advance it. ''We had been hoping that his campaign would make a difference,'' said John F. Sheehan, a spokesman for the Adirondack Council.</p>
        <p>Mr. D'Amato said fierce opposition to the bill from Midwestern senators has made passage all but impossible this year. But he pledged that the bill would be enacted eventually. ''You don't win every one of these battles overnight,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Some gay and lesbian groups have also harshly accused Mr. D'Amato of failing to pressure his fellow Republicans in Albany and Washington to pass anti-discrimination legislation. Mr. D'Amato contends that he has done all he could, but his critics say that he exploited the issue to win gay votes without doing any work.</p>
        <p>But other gay-rights advocates have praised Mr. D'Amato as a valued ally who has, among other things, forcefully argued for Senate confirmation of an openly gay man, James C. Hormel, to be ambassador to Luxembourg.</p>
        <p>These advocates echoed a point made by leaders from other grass-roots pressure groups: they do not care if Mr. D'Amato is motivated by the crassest of political calculations, so long as he helps their causes.</p>
        <p>''When you want to get something done, you shouldn't split political hairs over why people are doing it,'' said Winnie Stachelberg, political director of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay and lesbian political organization.</p>
