        <p>EVIDENTLY convinced that we all could use a laugh these days, public television is bringing forth a prime-time comedy series. Yes, that's right, not another documentary on the disappearing ozone layer or the latest constitutional crisis but a bit of humor, in the form of six half-hour playlets with the umbrella title of ''Trying Times.'' The first, ''A Family Tree,'' can be seen at 10 P.M. Sunday on Channel 13.  The list of talent credits for the series is certainly impressive. Phylis Geller, a public-television veteran, is the executive producer for Los Angeles station KCET. Over the years, she has been associated with an array of distinguished productions, ranging from ''The Great American Dream Machine'' to Wendy Wasserstein's ''Uncommon Women and Others'' and Tina Howe's ''Painting Churches.'' And with Jon S. Denny as creator and producer, ''Trying Times'' has recruited a stellar lineup. Among the directors: Jonathan Demme, Michael Lindsay-Hogg and Alan Arkin. Among the writers: Beth Henley, Spalding Gray, Christopher Durang and Ms. Wasserstein. Among the actors: Candice Bergen, Teri Garr, Mr. Gray, Swoosie Kurtz, Keanu Reeves, Ron Silver and Steven Wright.</p>
        <p>Promising, indeed. But, like NBC's experience with Steven Spielberg's ''Amazing Stories'' and its host of name contributors, this confrontation with original comedy turns out to be naggingly thin. I use the scruffy word playlets only in the spirit of generosity. Most of these scripts are little more than extended anecdotes. They are wisps of ideas, the kind of things that are jotted down on scraps of paper and filed away for possible future income from a project not demanding too much effort.</p>
        <p>''A Family Tree'' is typical of the series. The story is literally presented as an anecdote, with the teller sitting on a stool in some nondescript space. In this instance, she is Kara Dimly, played by Rosanna Arquette. The piece was written by Ms. Henley and Budge Threlkeld (while working on this project, Mr. Denny decided to produce the film ''Nobody's Fool,'' which also involved Ms. Arquette and Ms. Henley). The director of ''A Family Tree'' is Mr. Demme.</p>
        <p>In keeping with the series' promise to explore each week ''one of life's trying times,'' the premiere offers Kara accompanying her boyfriend Maxwell (John Stockwell) on a visit to his parents' home. She has never met the parents (Hope Lange and Robert Ridgley). They are not expecting her. Also present for the family dinner are Maxwell's belching, applejack-guzzling grandfather, Buckshot (John Steadman), and his decidedly odd brother-in-law Byron, played with deliciously ghoulish sincerity by David Byrne of Talking Heads.</p>
        <p>Kara is, of course, eager to please and, of course, her every gesture triggers a disaster, right down to her prospective father-in-law getting his hand caught in the kithen sink's automatic garbage-disposal unit. ''I'll never get over this,'' she tells him, ''making you cry on your 30th anniversary.'' Meanwhile, Mom has gotten into a lei-laden costume in anticipation of a trip to Hawaii that is about to be canceled because, as she is about to learn, her husband has lost his job after decades of loyalty and hard work. And Byron is challenging the others to ask him any question they want about poisonous snakes. The story begins and ends with the house burning down. Then the various characters come singly before the camera to explain how things worked out for the best after all.</p>
        <p>With so much solid talent involved, ''Trying Times'' is not without its inspired moments. Perhaps Ms. Geller and Mr. Denny can entice everyone back for another go-around. Practice might make, if not perfect, at least better.</p>
