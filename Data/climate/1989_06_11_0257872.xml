        <p>LEAD: AS the saying goes, Rome was not built in a day, but I doubt that Caesar tolerated destruction while under construction. So why can't one of the greatest cities in the world at the latter part of the 20th century keep the Long Island Expressway free of graffiti?</p>
        <p>AS the saying goes, Rome was not built in a day, but I doubt that Caesar tolerated destruction while under construction. So why can't one of the greatest cities in the world at the latter part of the 20th century keep the Long Island Expressway free of graffiti?</p>
        <p>Each morning, Manhattan-bound and a little bleary-eyed, a portion of my commute covers the stretch of the L.I.E. under construction between Woodhaven Boulevard and Maurice Avenue. When crews began to fell the trees and feed them into the roaring tree-eating machines, I could almost feel the oxygen lessen and the greenhouse effect worsen. (The Romans fed Christians to the lions, so I guess this is an improvement.) When construction was under way, I pitied the nearby homeowners as bulldozers on the shoulder of the road crept closer and closer to their houses.</p>
        <p>Eventually, a barrier was erected to muffle traffic noise for nearby residents. The first slab of concrete barely hardened before the testament of city dwelling was bestowed upon it. As if a large piece of canvas were freshly stretched across an easel, the still unfinished road reads like an advertisement for urban blight.</p>
        <p>A particularly sluggish rush hour offered me an opportunity to scrutinize the wall. ''Saint'' ''Ris!'' ''Nial'' ''Dek'': all of which I assume to be nicknames of the expressive youth. The word ''Duke'' appears more than once, but I doubt it has anything to do with a past presidential campaign. ''Keelow'' appears in big block letters; maybe the writers believe this to be the correct spelling for a measurement of cocaine.</p>
        <p>Unrecognizable cartoon faces and big puffy letters outlined in black but carefully filled in as if in a coloring book desecrate the concrete. In the places that are selected to scribble seem so inaccessible that one wonders what kind of determination drives these kids. Imagine if such energy and enthusiasm were harnessed for constructive purposes?</p>
        <p>I could understand if the walls were brimming with social commentary - ''Close Shoreham,'' ''Impeach Koch'' or ''Conserve Water.'' But there's nothing substantial. Maybe the ugliness of the graffiti themselves, products of a restless and misguided youth, is our message.</p>
        <p>Obviously this is not front-page crime, nor does it warrant spending valuable police time guarding miles of roadway, but it is a problem that should be addressed. Aside from esthetics, graffiti hurt real-estate value, show poor civic control over our youth and give the impression of an apathetic community.</p>
        <p>At present, such acts are considered criminal-mischief misdemeanors. According to the New York Police Public Information Office, punishment depends upon a number of variables, ranging from prior arrests to the age of the perpetrator.</p>
        <p>However, as a taxpayer and concerned citizen, I would like to see these midnight writers made directly responsible for their actions via a cleanup program and reverse the damage they've done. By turning in their can of spray paint for a scrub brush, they can return an untainted roadway to their community. Consequently, it may dissuade them for doing it in the future.</p>
        <p>I wonder what Caesar would have done with them?</p>
