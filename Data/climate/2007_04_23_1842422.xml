        <p>INTERNATIONAL A3-10</p>
        <p>Sarkozy Leads French Poll; Socialist in Second Place  Nicolas Sarkozy, the conservative, and Ségolène Royal, the Socialist, took the top spots in the first round of the presidential election. With more than 95 percent of the vote counted, Mr. Sarkozy was leading with about 30.7 percent of the vote, while Ms. Royal had about 25.2 percent.  A1</p>
        <p>Almost half of French voters over age 70 voted for the conservative candidate, Mr. Sarkozy. Almost 30 percent of those 18 to 24 favored the Socialist Party. Women supported Mr. Sarkozy and Ms. Royal equally; men were twice as likely to vote for the far-right candidate, Jean-Marie Le Pen, according to a telephone poll of registered voters. A10</p>
        <p>U.S. Knew of China Missile Test  After a Chinese interceptor smashed into a target satellite in January, Bush administration officials criticized the test. What they did not say is that as the Chinese were preparing to launch their antisatellite weapon, American intelligence agencies had issued reports about the preparations being made at the test facility in southern China.  A1</p>
        <p>Iraq Puts Stop to Work on Wall  Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki said he was ordering a halt to construction of a controversial wall that would block a Sunni neighborhood in Baghdad from other areas. The announcement appeared designed to allay mounting criticism from both Sunni Arab and Shiite parties. A6</p>
        <p>Israeli Minister Investigated  Israel's finance minister, Abraham Hirchson, said he was leaving office pending the outcome of a police investigation against him. The investigation involves suspicions that he embezzled funds before he joined the government, an Israeli police spokesman said. A10</p>
        <p>9 Dead, 40 Hurt in Afghanistan  Two bombings, one of them a suicide attack, rocked Khost, Afghanistan, killing 9 people and wounding more than 40, officials said. The suicide blast killed eight people and wounded at least 40, including several children, according to officials. The second bomb detonated in a video store, killing the owner and wounding seven. A3</p>
        <p>Somalian Plight Grows Worse  Government forces and insurgents in Somalia fought for a fifth straight day, killing scores of civilians and plunging the country deeper into chaos. United Nations officials say Somalia is headed toward its worst crisis ever. Estimates, at their most conservative, put the death toll from the past month near 1,000, with 200 people killed in the past week. A4</p>
        <p>Bangladeshi Kept From Return  Bangladesh's former prime minister, Sheik Hasina Wazed,was blocked from boarding a flight home from London after her country's military-backed interim government barred her from returning. A9</p>
        <p>NATIONAL A12-16</p>
        <p>Debate Invitations Besiege Presidential Candidates</p>
        <p>A flood of debate invitations is besieging Republican and Democratic candidates, thrusting them into a complicated political vortex as they struggle to balance their own needs with the demands of sensitive and powerful debate sponsors who candidates are eager not to offend.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Classes to Resume in Virginia  Classes are scheduled to resume at Virginia Tech today, and as the campus tries to regain a sense of normalcy, professors struggle to find a sensitive way to shift the discussion back toward course work. Meanwhile, investigators are trying to solve the mystery of the motive of the gunman, Seung-Hui Cho.</p>
        <p>A14</p>
        <p>As Korean-Americans in Centreville, Va., gathered at local churches, they embraced a time for reflection and spiritual solace after the week's jolting news that Seung-Hui Cho, who hailed from their community, had killed 32 people, and then himself, at Virginia Tech.</p>
        <p>A14</p>
        <p>Ecological Conflict Over Dams  In Klamath Falls, Ore., a conflict has arisen between PacifiCorp, a power company that owns energy producing hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River. Indian tribes, fishermen, and environmentalists who want the dams removed because they say the dams block endangered salmon from migrating.</p>
        <p>A12</p>
        <p>McCain's Emissions Proposal  John McCain is expected to call for America to be weaned from its reliance on foreign oil and for a cap on emissions of greenhouse gases as a way to fight global warming. He called global warming ''a serious and urgent economic, environmental and national security challenge.''</p>
        <p>A14</p>
        <p>Specter Critical of Gonzales  Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales's failure to step down was ''no doubt, bad for the Justice Department.'' Mr. Specter's comments reflected a continued lack of support for Mr. Gonzales among key Republicans on Capitol Hill as he faces accusations that the dismissals of eight United States attorneys were politically motivated.</p>
        <p>A15</p>
        <p>Run-In Over Climate Change  An argument broke out at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner between Karl Rove, the president's deputy chief of staff, and the singer Sheryl Crow and Laurie David, a top Democratic donor and a producer of the global warming documentary featuring Al Gore, ''An Inconvenient Truth.''</p>
        <p>A16</p>
        <p>NEW YORK/REGION  B1-6</p>
        <p>In the Face of Retirement, A Cardinal Is Evaluated  In the dusk of his half-century-long career, Cardinal Edward M. Egan, 75, remains something of a riddle. As he faces possible retirement, in accordance with church law he has submitted his resignation to the Vatican, the challenges facing the second largest archdiocese in the nation extend well beyond uncertain finances. A1</p>
        <p>Plan for a Greener New York  In a plan to create what he called ''the first environmentally sustainable 21st-century city,'' Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg proposed a sweeping vision of 127 projects, regulations and innovations for the city and surrounding region. The plan would put in place a host of environmentally sensitive measures that would reduce greenhouse gases and foster steady population growth. B1</p>
        <p>Same-Sex Marriage Bill  Gov. Eliot Spitzer will introduce a bill to legalize same-sex marriage in New York, a move that would propel the state to the forefront of one of the most contentious issues in politics. B1</p>
        <p>SPORTSMONDAY D1-8</p>
        <p>Coach Fuels Yankee's Hot Start  In the weeks after the Yankees' swift elimination from the playoffs last year, the first significant change the team made was to hire a new hitting coach, Kevin Long. Third baseman Alex Rodriguez met with Long for five days in the offseason, and armed with a better frame of mind and a sleeker physique, is off to perhaps the hottest start in baseball history.</p>
        <p>ARTS E1-8</p>
        <p>Having Words Over Handel  A panel discussion at the American Handel Festival 2007 at Princeton centered around an explosive issue: Michael Marissen's thesis that ''Messiah'' and more specifically the ''Hallelujah'' chorus -- perhaps the most sacrosanct and beloved totem in Western music -- conveys malice toward Judaism.</p>
