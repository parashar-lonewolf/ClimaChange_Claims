        <p>LEAD: ''Well,'' said STanley, ''will I see you at the Lazars' Wednesday night?'' ''I can't,'' I said, ''I have a funeral.'' ''I don't blame you,'' said Stanley. ''I don't know whether I'll go either. I love Swifty and Mary, but Spago is only so big, and after a while, you can't really talk to anybody. Besides, I'm not interested in watching the Oscar show this year.</p>

        <p>LEAD: ''Well,'' said STanley, ''will I see you at the Lazars' Wednesday night?'' ''I can't,'' I said, ''I have a funeral.'' ''I don't blame you,'' said Stanley. ''I don't know whether I'll go either. I love Swifty and Mary, but Spago is only so big, and after a while, you can't really talk to anybody. Besides, I'm not interested in watching the Oscar show this year.</p>
        <p>''Well,'' said STanley, ''will I see you at the Lazars' Wednesday night?'' ''I can't,'' I said, ''I have a funeral.'' ''I don't blame you,'' said Stanley. ''I don't know whether I'll go either. I love Swifty and Mary, but Spago is only so big, and after a while, you can't really talk to anybody. Besides, I'm not interested in watching the Oscar show this year. I mean, there's not one picture I wish I had produced.''</p>
        <p>This was another way of saying that nothing Stanley has produced in the last five years has been nominated for anything except sound recording.</p>
        <p>Stanley was in town from the Coast for two days of old-fashioned hush-hush negotiations. We hadn't gotten together for a while, but, in the meantime, there had been joshing telephone calls whenever he had a film that was about to open.</p>
        <p>He was continuing to be one of the most active ''personal'' producers in the business, every 12 to 18 months making one tasteful, big-budget picture that died at the box office, plus one or two others, at a tenth of the cost, starring that week's pop phenomenon, which paid the the bills for his beloved flops.</p>
        <p>I told Stanley that he must be proud of his son, Stanley Jr., who had produced the two biggest moneymaking films of 1987 and 1988. ''Yeah,'' he said. ''Dig in.'' We were having lunch in Stanley's pied-a-terre in Trump Tower, or what passed for lunch. Nothing that contained cholestrol, sugar, artificial flavorings or, he assured me, chemical preservatives. In fact, very little food. Just the view, the van Goghs, Perrier water and fruit salad, from which Stanley removed the five possibly toxic grapes on each plate.</p>
        <p>''Go down the list of the nominated pictures,'' said Stanley. ''There's not one made by a producer you've ever heard of. In the old days, producers were producers. They produced. They loved pictures and knew how to put them together. Where are the Hal Wallises, the Jack Warners, the Sam Goldwyns, the Darryl Zanucks, the David Selznicks?'' ''Dead?'' ''Exactly,'' said Stanley. ''Today every Tom, Dick and Harry is producing his own picture, like Jessica Lange. What can you expect?''</p>
        <p>I mentioned the nominees: ''The Accidental Tourist,'' ''Dangerous Liaisons,'' ''Mississippi Burning,'' ''Rain Man'' and ''Working Girl.'' Also that 1988 was the highest grossing year in Hollywood history.  ''Basically,'' said Stanley. ''you're right. Take 'Accidental Tourist.' That picture would have killed Harry Cohn. The star running off at the end with the featured player? And who wants to see a picture  [ ''Dangerous Liaisons'' ]  about the French Revolution without a guillotine in it? Don't these people have any sense of history? Like 'Mississippi Burning.' I'm sorry, but that picture really offended me. Call me old-fashioned if you will, but I believe in truth. And 'Rain Man'! I could have produced 'Rain Man,' but I passed on it. I don't like movies set in orphanages.'' I said that I didn't think it was set in an orphanage.'' ''The part I saw was,'' said Stanley. ''I love Dusty  [ Dustin Hoffman ]  like he was my own son, but he needs a real producer. Someone to point him in the right direction.'' Stanley sighed. ''Go tell him. 'Working Girl' at least had a few laughs, even though Jean Harlow did it 50 years ago.''</p>
        <p>''Stanley,'' I said, ''you would have given your left elbow to have produced 'Working Girl.' ''</p>
        <p>''The point is,'' he said, and smiled sort of sheepishly, ''I didn't.''</p>
        <p>I suggested that Stanley Jr. seemed to have his fingers on the pulse of moviegoing America, considering the two home runs he'd hit his first two times at bat, getting his feet wet, so to speak. ''Yeah,'' said Stanley. ''Does passion fruit come from Chile?'' Stanley spit out some greenish pulp and took a long drink of water. There was a pause while he checked his vital signs.</p>
        <p>''The thing is,'' said Stanley, ''I want to produce pictures that are about something, pictures that say something, pictures that, at the same time . . . .'' ''. . . make you feel good?'' ''Exactly,'' said Stanley. ''Which is why I've come to New York.''</p>
        <p>We had arrived at that point in the conversation where Stanley could no longer resist talking about his upcoming projects. It makes no difference that not one out of 20 comes to pass. Stanley lives on futures.  ''One of the reasons I'm here,'' he said, ''is to talk to Roy.'' ''Roy? Roy who?'' ''Well not Roy himself, but his people.'' ''Roy Disney?'' Stanley looked pained. ''Satyajit Roy, the Indian kid.''</p>
        <p>''Oh,'' I said. ''Ray. Satyajit Ray, though I'm never sure how to pronounce it.''</p>
        <p>''Roy,'' said Stanley with authority. ''I think. Or maybe Rye. It certainly is not Ray. In any case, and this is strictly between us, I think I'm close to buying the English-language remake rights to 'The Apu Trilogy.' '' ''Oh, my god,'' I said.  Stanley beamed. ''I thought that would interest you.'' ''As a musical?'' ''No,'' said Stanley, ''though there will certainly be some music in it. Spirituals, folk songs, that sort of thing. And maybe a title song by Burt or Henry or Jule. Can you picture it?'' I said I wasn't sure.  ''Set in the South, during the Depression and coming up to the present day, about blacks and whites. An American saga.'' ''It's very, very Indian, isn't it?'' ''So what,'' said Stanley. ''The story is universal, like 'Cousin, Cousine.' I ran it the other night, and I have to admit that I was bawling from the opening credits on. Six hours or whatever it is. It knocked my socks off.'' I said something feeble about pacing, about the Hindu concept of life, fate.</p>
        <p>''Well,'' said Stanley, ''it has to be re-thought. I'm not about to make a mini-series. This will be bigger than 'Roots' or 'War and Remembrance.' But shorter.'' Stanley could tell that I was not getting the picture.  ''In any case,'' he said, ''that's just one of the reasons I'm here.'' ''The other?'' ''It's public domain,'' said Stanley. ''I really can't discuss it.'' ''Come on. You know me.'' ''Well,'' said Stanley, ''it's not exactly public domain. It involves certain rights, and I think I'm in on the ground floor. But it's very topical, if you know what I mean. And controversial.''</p>
        <p>''Anything to do with Iran? A certain ayatollah? A controversial former member of the Marine Corps?''</p>
        <p>''You're not going to get it out of me,'' said Stanley, ''though you couldn't be further from the mark.''</p>
        <p>''A biopic about a certain recent President who was once an actor?''</p>
        <p>''I told you,'' said Stanley, ''I'm not opening my mouth. It has nothing to do with with Ronnie and Nancy. For the time being, they're still overexposed. Picture-wise. No, this is about the National Rifle Association.'' ''You're kidding!'' ''I couldn't be more serious. You know the sort of pictures Warners used to make about the F.B.I.? Well, this is going to be about the National Rifle Association. I told you it was controversial.'' ''Whose side will it be on?'' ''What do you mean, 'Whose side?' I don't make movies for special interest groups. In that direction lies bankruptcy. No, this is going to be a straight romantic drama about a husband and wife, their children and the National Rifle Association.''</p>
        <p>''Let's see. The Middle West. A Plains state. He's a gun lover, has been all his life. He likes to hunt, but only for the food he puts on the table. His wife hates guns on general principle, or maybe ever since her father accidentally shot the postman thinking he was a prowler.''</p>
        <p>''You see,'' said Stanley, delighted. ''You're prejudiced. I told you this would be controversial. The point is, though, not to come up with easy answers. To make people like you think, and to make people on the other side think. There are two sides to every question.'' ''Who's writing it?'' ''Several people at the moment. Each one on his own. I wish Robert Sherwood were still alive. The way I see it, it'll be a sort of 'Best Years of Our Lives' for the 1990's.'' ''Stanley,'' I said, ''you're incorrigible.'' ''I know,'' he said, very pleased.</p>
        <p>''There must be some other controversial, topical themes you're interested in. Nuclear power, the greenhouse effect?'' ''I have a script about the greenhouse effect.'' Stanley shook his head and frowned. ''I know it sounds like a great idea, very visual, what with icecaps melting, the Statue of Liberty standing up to her knees in water. But that's science fiction. When you think about it long enough, what the greenhouse effect really comes down to, today, is skin cancer, and I'm not interested in docudramas.''</p>
        <p>''What about Stanley Jr.?'' I said. ''I thought that when the time came, you two would be a partnership.''</p>
        <p>''So did I,'' said Stanley. ''I sent him to Princeton. He spent a summer at Oxford and got his M.B.A. from the Wharton School. He was even a gofer at MCA, but I'm afraid he had other plans.''</p>
        <p>There was a moment of rare silence between us. I seemed to have hit a nerve.</p>
        <p>''The thing is,'' said Stanley, ''he's a terrible producer. He's just been lucky. And I'm not saying anything that I haven't said to his face.</p>
        <p>'' 'Son,' I said, when he showed me that first picture, 'I have to be frank. This picture stinks. It stars a couple of kids nobody has ever heard of, has a leading lady whose cheekbones are down around her thighs, and has a story about a magic computer that makes no sense whatsoever. Take my advice: shelve it. It won't draw flies.''</p>
        <p>I tried to be comforting. ''I guess that's the mysterious thing about the movie business.''</p>
        <p>''I mean,'' said Stanley, who was working himself up into a froth, ''when he was trying to cast that thing, John Candy wouldn't return his calls. To give you some idea what people thought, Jim Belushi turned him down!''</p>
        <p>I asked Stanley how he explained it, the film's success, that is. He shrugged his shoulders and sniffed, as if assaulted by an unpleasant odor. We said nothing more until the espresso was served.</p>
        <p>''As you might expect,'' Stanley said at last, ''he's not easy to talk to these days. With just two pictures, he's made more money than I've made in 30 years.'' ''A chip off the old block,'' I said.  Stanley did not seem entirely displeased. ''I guess you could put it that way.''</p>
