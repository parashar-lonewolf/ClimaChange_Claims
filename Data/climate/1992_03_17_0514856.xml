        <p>FAR from being ruinously expensive, efforts to head off a feared global warming could actually save money or even turn a profit in the long run, environmentalists, government analysts and even some business leaders and economists say.</p>
        <p>The view is contrary to that of the Bush Administration, which in international talks has resisted placing limits on emissions of carbon dioxide, a heat-trapping gas. The Administration has found support from studies indicating that the costs of ultimately reducing emissions could run to tens of billions of dollars a year.</p>
        <p>But now the opposite view is being pressed with increasing insistence. Citing studies of their own, advocates argue that reducing the emissions would force the economy to use energy more efficiently and at less cost in the long run, would free up large amounts of capital for expansion if the right governmental policies were followed, and would make American business more competitive internationally.</p>
        <p>"To ignore the economic opportunities is to fail to seize the moment, to become paralyzed by exclusive focus on one side of the economic ledger," Dr. Robert N. Stavins, an economist at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, said at a recent conference on the subject at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington.</p>
        <p>A recent study by four environmental groups, coordinated by the Union of Concerned Scientists, concluded that aggressive action to lower carbon dioxide emissions by 70 percent over the next 40 years could cost the economy about $2.7 trillion. But it could also save consumers and industry $5 trillion in fuel and electricity bills, the study found, for a net saving of $2.3 trillion.</p>
        <p>And unofficial studies by Environmental Protection Agency analysts conclude that the gross national product would rise, not fall, over the next 20 years if emissions were reduced through a "carbon tax" on the extraction of coal, oil and natural gas -- and the tax revenues were "recycled" back into the economy through investment tax credits for industry, thus spurring capital investment.</p>
        <p>Competing studies consider different factors and operate on different assumptions, and no consensus on the net economic effect of reducing carbon dioxide emissions has emerged. But the economic debate has been joined, and its outcome could be critical in the attempt to deal with a global environmental concern of the first magnitude.</p>
        <p>Carbon dioxide and other gases, chiefly methane, trap heat in the atmosphere much as glass panes trap it in a greenhouse. An international panel of scientists convened by the United Nations has predicted that if current emission rates continue, the earth's average surface temperature will rise by 3 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the next century. Many scientists believe this could have a catastrophic effect on climate.</p>
        <p>Global warming and energy are inextricably linked because carbon dioxide, the most abundant and important greenhouse gas emitted by industrial society, is produced by burning fossil fuels like coal and oil. The United States, which lags behind other industrialized countries like Japan and Germany in energy efficiency, is the world's leading emitter of carbon dioxide. Thus, greater efficiency of energy use in this country is viewed as essential in trying to stabilize or reduce carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
        <p>Analysis by the Environmental Protection Agency suggests that modest energy-efficiency measures already under way will allow American per-capita emissions of carbon dioxide to stabilize at 1990 levels by the year 2000, at little or no cost to the economy. The European Community has called for overall emissions to be stabilized at 1990 levels by 2000; although the United States has opposed such a target and timetable, the E.P.A.'s analysis suggests that as a practical matter, it will be close to compliance anyway.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, an American-European impasse on emission ceilings has held up agreement on a climate treaty, which would be signed at a United Nations-sponsored summit meeting on the environment in Rio de Janeiro in June. The final round of talks will start April 30 in New York.</p>
        <p>But even if an agreement is reached, it may be only a first step. Sharp Reductions Urged</p>
        <p>Many scientists believe that sharp reductions in carbon dioxide emissions -- not just a stabilization -- will ultimately be necessary. They say that at 1990 rates of emission, atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide would still grow. And in this context, the debate on the economic effects of reducing emissions takes on even greater importance. Answers will be needed if it becomes clearer in the next few years that the threat of warming is indeed serious.</p>
        <p>One major study made public last December, commissioned by Congress and carried out by the Department of Energy, concluded that reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels would cost $95 billion a year in 2000. In general, its conclusions are consistent with those of a number of other Government and private studies.</p>
        <p>But the study is based on the assumption that the economy is already using energy in the most efficient way possible, said Alden Meyer, an energy analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists. "That assumption is flat-out false," Mr. Meyer said.</p>
        <p>He said the market contained many barriers to the adoption of more efficient practices and technologies. For instance, a landlord may have no incentive to install more energy-efficient appliances or windows because tenants pay electricity bills.  If the landlord was offered a subsidy to do so, the barrier could be overcome.  Incentives for Efficiency</p>
        <p>Electric companies in a few states are indeed paying customers to install more efficient lighting, cooling and heating systems, for example, in lieu of building new emission-producing power plants. The companies are allowed to recover the money by increasing rates. The saving to the economy comes in the form of lower electric bills for the building owner.  The restraint on emissions comes both from lower energy use and not having to build a new power plant.</p>
        <p>The study, coordinated by Mr. Meyer, found that if an aggressive policy to expand energy efficiency and switch to clean, renewable energy sources were pursued, the economy would reap a net saving of $2.3 trillion over the next 40 years and carbon dioxide emissions would be reduced by 70 percent.</p>
        <p>Participating in the study along with the Union of Concerned Scientists were the Alliance to Save Energy, the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy and the Natural Resources Defense Council, all nonprofit organizations that advocate greater efficiency of energy use.</p>
        <p>But an analyst at the Department of Energy, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that while the department favored the removal of barriers to greater efficiency, consumer behavior was more complicated than the environmentalists' study assumes. That could make the barriers more difficult to remove, he said.</p>
        <p>He said the environmentalists' study assumed that the economy would continue to shift away from manufacturing as it has in the past, which he called a questionable assumption. He said the study also assumed a lower basic growth rate for the economy: 2.5 percent a year as compared with 3 percent in the Department of Energy study. A higher growth rate means emission reductions are more difficult and costly to achieve.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meyer criticized the Administration's projected 3 percent growth rate as unrealistically high, a view that is shared by many private economists.</p>
        <p>Analysts for the Environmental Protection Agency say the Energy Department study does not reflect the ways in which, according to the unofficial study by their agency, the proceeds of a carbon tax could be recycled through the tax system to spur economic growth. The analysts found that if the tax revenues were used to reduce personal income taxes or the Federal budget deficit, this would barely offset, if at all, the negative effect of the tax.</p>
        <p>That negative impact would come when the coal and oil industries passed on the carbon tax to their customers in the form of higher prices. But if the revenue was used to encourage business investment through tax credits, they found, the effect of the carbon tax would be more than offset, producing a net gain for the national economy.</p>
        <p>A combination of investment tax credits and personal income-tax reductions -- to make the tax more acceptable to consumers -- could achieve substantial reductions in carbon emissions at no cost, according to the analysis.</p>
        <p>Market-based solutions of this sort could also make the price of American goods and services more competitive with those of the more energy-efficient economies of Europe and Japan, said Dr. Stavins.</p>
        <p>While the current anti-tax mood of the United States discourages the adoption of a carbon tax, at least for now, the European Community is seriously considering it as the centerpiece of its efforts to reduce emissions.</p>
        <p>Relatively cheap energy in the United States has made this country less efficient and therefore less competitive worldwide, Stephan Schmidheiny, a Swiss industrialist, told the Smithsonian conference. Mr. Schmidneiny is the principal adviser for business and industry to Maurice F. Strong, the secretary general of the U.N. environment meeting.</p>
        <p>Shakeouts are painful, and the move to an energy-efficient market would undoubtedly produce some transitional pain, even if the end result is a more robust economy. Coal and oil producers and their employees, for example, could be heavily hit by a carbon tax, even if other sectors benefited from the recycling of the tax. The Ultimate Cost</p>
        <p>Beyond all this, another question arises: What would be the cost of not taking action if serious global warming occurs?</p>
        <p>Few economists have addressed it.  One, Dr. William D. Nordhaus of Yale University, has published a "best guess" estimate that a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide would reduce this country's gross national product by one-fourth of 1 percent.  But Dr. Nordhaus notes that many important factors are not included in economic accounts. These include "human health, biological diversity, amenity values of everyday life and leisure, and environmental quality," he wrote in a 1990 monograph.</p>
        <p>It may be impossible to place monetary values on some of these big factors, even though they are clearly valuable. Biologists, for instance, fear that global warming will catastrophically speed a steady loss of biological species that is now occurring worldworld. They also believe that the world's forests harbor untold billions of dollars worth of biological riches that could be exploited for pharmaceuticals and other products without harming the environment. But their worth has not been gauged.</p>
        <p>The effort to do so is "low on the totem pole of what is of interest to our discipline," Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Company Inc., said recently at a debate on development and the environment held in Cambridge, Mass., under the sponsorship of Earthwatch, a Boston-based scientific research and education organization.</p>
        <p>Some scientists believe economists should refrain from even making the attempt until more is known about the biological world. The tropical forests, for example, are mostly unexplored and only a fraction of species with economic value have been identified. Pending more knowledge, Dr. E. O. Wilson, a conservation biologist at Harvard University, said at the Cambridge debate, economists "should avoid fruitless and dangerous exercises in cost-benefit analysis which is far beyond their reach and join in the ethic of saving every scrap of biological diversity possible."</p>
