        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Few economic analysts would deny that the massive increase in military spending over the last 10 years, in particular the record rise in procurement of expensive and complicated weapons systems, is partly responsible for the growing weaknesses in the United States economy - most notably for the serious underinvestment in civilian industry and the diversion of some of our best scientists and engineers from much-needed nonmilitary research. Even former senior Defense Department officials now concede that the military buildup was badly conceived and mismanaged -yet another example of how interservice rivalries and military-industrial interests can drive an irrational and wasteful procurement process.</p>
        <p>Now on the heels of this sad experience comes a report from the Defense Science Board that is so breathtaking in its disregard of recent history that it proposes the Defense Department ''take an active role in shaping national economic policies.'' Its recommendations include, among others, the formation of an industrial policy council, headed by the President's national security adviser, ''to bolster industries that support the military'' (front page, Oct. 19).</p>
        <p>Even more unsettling is the endorsement of this recommendation by several business and academic savants (''Toward a 'Pentagon Inc.' '', Business section, Oct. 23) out of a recognition, it seems, that we cannot compete in the world economy without industrial planning and that the Defense Department is the only agency available for this critical task because of its experience.</p>
        <p>Some form of national strategic planning, I agree, is needed - as the Defense Science Board implies. But faith in the Pentagon as the appropriate agency for such an important function, upon which our industrial health and standard of living depend, is badly misplaced and risks the continuing sacrifice of our economic competitiveness to weapons development.</p>
        <p>For one thing, international economic competition today places a premium on developing high-quality technology that answers a wide range of consumer and industrial needs; yet the complex military specifications that guide Pentagon research and development increasingly diverge from those required for the production of competitive civilian goods. Civilian spinoffs today are fewer in number and more costly in development. To emphasize militarily guided industrial development, as the Defense Science Board report would have us do, would be to steer industrial technology farther onto a noncompetitive path.</p>
        <p>Second, it is hard to find any evidence that the knowledge and experience needed to put together and sustain innovative and complex combinations of capital, technology and labor - the essence of successful industrial policy - are present in the Pentagon. Its recent record of weapons failures, cost overruns, waste, even corruption, should give pause to anyone considering giving the Pentagon a greater say in managing our cutting-edge industries.</p>
        <p>But most important, the purposes of national strategic planning must be far broader, and far more democratically arrived at, than anything that could possibly be conceived by the Pentagon. What does the Department of Defense know about energy conservation or about alternative energy development, which will be needed to stave off the next energy crisis? What does it know about producing competitive machine tools? Or about the employment needs of urban and rural America?</p>
        <p>To concede to the Department of Defense a bigger role in our nation's economic policy is to remove that policy farther from the very people -from labor, industry, state and local governments - whose participation and full cooperation is critical to America's economic revival. Do we really want our nation's economic priorities determined by the secret deliberations of Pentagon bureaucrats and weapons designers?</p>
        <p>Today the primary threats to the nation are economic, social and environmental in nature: declining capital and labor productivity, escalating corporate and government debt levels, a deteriorating technological and infrastructure base, global warming and ozone depletion, to mention a few.</p>
        <p>To suggest that the unelected bureaucrats of the Pentagon should have an inordinate say in formulating policy to meet these threats defies both political and economic logic. Only the next President - not the Pentagon - can initiate with Congress a process broad enough to assess competing demands openly and fairly, to reconcile inevitable trade-offs and, ultimately, to marshall public and private resources for national purposes. ARCHIBALD L. GILLIES  New York, Nov. 1, 1988  The writer is president of the World Policy Institute.</p>
