        <p>Four months after Connecticut regulators rejected a plan to build a power cable across Long Island Sound, saying it would damage oyster beds and provide little benefit to Connecticut residents, the company seeking to build the cable has come up with a new plan that seeks to limit its environmental and commercial impact.</p>

        <p>Four months after Connecticut regulators rejected a plan to build a power cable across Long Island Sound, saying it would damage oyster beds and provide little benefit to Connecticut residents, the company seeking to build the cable has come up with a new plan that seeks to limit its environmental and commercial impact.</p>
        <p>Under the latest proposal, the cable system -- which would include two high-voltage cables and one fiber-optic connection -- would be rerouted to avoid the areas of New Haven Harbor that are rich in commercially cultivated shellfish.</p>
        <p>The Cross-Sound Cable Company, a subsidiary of Trans√ânergie U.S. Ltd., submitted the new proposal yesterday afternoon to the Connecticut Siting Council, the regulatory body that rejected the previous application in March.</p>
        <p>Richard M. Kessel, the chairman of the Long Island Power Authority, said that the cable, which would be able to transmit 330 megawatts of electricity between New Haven and Shoreham, in Suffolk County, was a critical component of the utility's plan to prevent blackouts on Long Island.</p>
        <p>Under the new proposal, Mr. Kessel said, New England regulators would be able to control the flow of power through the cable.</p>
        <p>But while the company may have addressed some of its critics' concerns, others remain. Some people are skeptical of the very idea of a cable, saying that like scarves or perfume, imported energy could prove to be expensive.</p>
        <p>''The idea that Long Island's going to be able to buy a lot of cheap power during the peak summer hours doesn't make any sense,'' said Nathanael Greene, a senior policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council. ''The people up in New England are going to use the cheap power, and whatever is left for Long Island to purchase will be expensive.''</p>
        <p>Connecticut's attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, suggested that Long Island meet its energy demand by creating more supply, building more power plants on its own turf.</p>
        <p>''As long as it's sucking energy from elsewhere, it will fail to meet its own energy obligations, and it will contribute to price increases on both sides of the Sound,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As utility officials and their watchdogs debated the merits of the new cross-Sound cable proposal, the Suffolk County executive approved a law limiting the amount of carbon dioxide that its power plants could emit.</p>
        <p>According to the bill, which the Legislature passed in June and County Executive Robert J. Gaffney signed yesterday, power plants that emit more than 1,800 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour will be fined $2 for every ton above the limit. The law goes into effect next March.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, plants could buy emission credits through carbon dioxide trading markets or avoid penalties by investing in alternative energy sources.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kessel said the new law would not drive up electricity prices.</p>
        <p>''I think that this bill certainly makes a very important environmental point,'' he said. ''We are comfortable that we can comply with its provisions without facing serious economic harms that would force us to raise electric rates.''</p>
