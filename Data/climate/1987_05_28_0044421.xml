        <p>LEAD: The special prosecutor in the Michael K. Deaver case accused the Canadian Government today of ''duplicitous behavior'' intended to block the prosecution of the former White House aide on perjury charges related to Canada.</p>

        <p>LEAD: The special prosecutor in the Michael K. Deaver case accused the Canadian Government today of ''duplicitous behavior'' intended to block the prosecution of the former White House aide on perjury charges related to Canada.</p>
        <p>The special prosecutor in the Michael K. Deaver case accused the Canadian Government today of ''duplicitous behavior'' intended to block the prosecution of the former White House aide on perjury charges related to Canada.</p>
        <p>The charge by the prosecutor, Whitney North Seymour Jr., came after Canada filed a protest with the State Department over subpoenas issued to its Ambassador to the United States and his wife, ordering them to testify at Mr. Deaver's trial.</p>
        <p>In a court motion to enforce the subpoena, Mr. Seymour said the Ambassador, Allan E. Gotlieb, was a ''key prosecution witness'' who had, in effect, waived diplomatic immunity last year. Prosecutor Presses Issue</p>
        <p>The Government of Canada, the prosecutor said, ''should not be permitted to prevent Mr. Gotlieb from telling the truth.''</p>
        <p>According to both Canada and the State Department, however, the Ambassador and his wife, Sondra, are still protected by diplomatic immunity and cannot be compelled to testify at Mr. Deaver's trial.</p>
        <p>Mr. Deaver has been accused of lying to Congress and a Federal grand jury about a lobbying business he formed after resigning from the White House in 1985. One count of the five-count indictment deals specifically with his ties to Canada and Canadian-American issues.</p>
        <p>The State Department issued its own statement today supporting the Canadian protest against Mr. Seymour, who acts independently of the Reagan Administration.</p>
        <p>A senior Canadian official who asked not to be identified said the Canadian Government was disturbed by the subpoenas and viewed the situation with ''great seriousness.''</p>
        <p>''The testimony sought by the independent counsel does not relate to events external to the embassy,'' the official said. ''Rather it relates to official communications from the Government of Canada to officials in the White House.</p>
        <p>''This, of course, goes to the very heart of the concept of diplomatic immunity.''</p>
        <p>In his 10-page court motion filed in Federal District Court here, Mr. Seymour said the Ambassador had waived diplomatic immunity when the Canadian Government agreed last year to provide written answers to questions from the prosecutors.</p>
        <p>''Once the door is open,'' he wrote, ''restrictions cannot be imposed on the proper use of the information supplied.''</p>
        <p>He said the Ambassador's testimony was ''essential proof to establish Michael K. Deaver's perjury.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Seymour said Mrs. Gotlieb, a writer who is known in the capital as something of a diplomatic gadfly, had ''first-hand knowledge concerning certain of these facts'' and participated in a January 1985 luncheon with her husband and Mr. Deaver that is mentioned in the indictment. 'Duplicitous Behavior'</p>
        <p>The prosecutor said Canada's recent actions appear ''calculated to conceal the duplicitous behavior of the Canadian Government in seeking to put itself in a position where it can tell critics of Canada that it has cooperated fully with our investigation, while it has actually taken a position to block the prosecution of Mr. Deaver for perjury concerning his dealings with Canadian representatives.''</p>
        <p>Canadian officials said an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation appeared at the Canadian chancery in Washington Tuesday afternoon and indicated he had subpoenas for the Gotliebs.</p>
        <p>The chancery refused to accept the subpoenas, and the agent was turned away, the officials said. They would not say whether the Gotliebs were at the chancery at the time.</p>
        <p>In his court papers, Mr. Seymour described the scene differently, saying he had ''dispatched an agent to Mr. Gotlieb's office to inquire as to his availability and that of Mrs. Gotlieb to accept service of trial subpoenas.'' Knowledge of Contract</p>
        <p>Ambassador Gotlieb has extensive knowledge of the contract, which was signed with Mr. Deaver's lobbying firm after he left the White House and his post as deputy chief of staff.</p>
        <p>One count of the indictment charges Mr. Deaver with lying about topics involving Canada.</p>
        <p>He is accused of committing perjury when he claimed he could not remember several White House meetings involving acid rain, an issue that has long strained Canadian-American relations, and that he was not involved in the choice of a presidential envoy to negotiate an acid-rain agreement with Canada.</p>
        <p>The Canadian Government has acknowledged that the ambassador provided written statements to Mr. Seymour during the Deaver investigation.</p>
        <p>''We have cooperated to an unprecedented extent in the independent counsel's investigation in the interest of assisting everyone concerned in getting out the facts,'' a Canadian official complained. ''From the outset it was made clear we were doing this on a voluntary basis while maintaining our diplomatic immunity.''</p>
        <p>Canadian officials indicated that Mr. Seymour was breaking promises made to the Canadian Government in a June 25, 1986, letter requesting an informal interview with Mr. Gotlieb.</p>
        <p>In the letter, Mr. Seymour said he and his staff were ''prepared to commit ourselves not to quote you in any public proceeding without your prior permission.''</p>
