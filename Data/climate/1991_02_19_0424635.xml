        <p>A GLOBAL warming caused by industrial and automotive emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide could well build on itself and produce even more warming, some scientists argue.

        <p>A GLOBAL warming caused by industrial and automotive emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide could well build on itself and produce even more warming, some scientists argue. The warming, they say, would stimulate the release of more carbon dioxide from natural storage places like forests, grasslands and wetlands.</p>
        <p>The case has not been proved, but the issue has been raised once again by a provocative new study. It shows that when the production of carbon dioxide by fossil-fuel burning is discounted, global temperature and naturally occurring concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide rose and fell in tandem on many time scales between 1958 and 1988 -- with changes in temperature generally preceding changes in levels of carbon dioxide by a matter of months.</p>
        <p>While the findings do not establish that rises in temperature cause rises in atmospheric carbon dioxide, they do suggest it and are "very tantalizing," said Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, a senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, an author of the report in the current issue of the British journal Nature.</p>
        <p>If warming does stimulate the release of more carbon dioxide, he said, it means that the global warming already observed in the last decade, no matter what its cause, could in itself stimulate further warming in the years ahead even if humans stopped pouring carbon dioxide into the atmosphere now. Carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases hold heat inside the atmosphere much as panes of glass hold it inside a greenhouse.</p>
        <p>And if the industrial and automotive emissions continue, Dr. Oppenheimer said, it could mean that the warming will be even greater in the long run.</p>
        <p>Scientists say that the average surface temperature of the globe in 1990, at nearly 60 degrees Fahrenheit, was the highest since record-keeping began in the late 19th century, and that seven of the warmest years since 1880 occurred in the last 11 years. But climatologists say it is too early to know whether carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases emitted as a result of human activity caused the warming or whether it resulted from natural factors.</p>
        <p>The new study was conducted by Dr. Oppenheimer, Dr. R. M. Fujita and Dr. S. R. Gaffing ofthe Environmental Defense Fund, and Dr. J. B. Marston of Cornell University. It is "the latest bit of evidence" pointing toward the possibility that warming produces more warming by stimulating the release of carbon dioxide from natural sources, said Dr. George M. Woodwell, director of the Woods Hole Research Center in Woods Hole, Mass., one of the first to advance the idea. Some Are Skeptical</p>
        <p>Dr. Woodwell maintains that by feeding on itself, the warming could continue indefinitely unless steps are taken to slow or stop it. But he, too, said that the idea of a feedback effect between warming and the release of naturally produced carbon dioxide was unproved, and called it "one of the great uncertainties about the warming of the earth."</p>
        <p>Other scientists expressed skepticism about the proposition suggested by the latest study. "I think it's misleading to say the temperature is the primary cause of the increase in carbon dioxide," said Dr. C. D. Keeling of the Scripps Oceanographic Institution in La Jolla, Calif., who has also analyzed the relationship between temperature and carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>Dr. Keeling said that natural factors besides temperature probably influence carbon dioxide levels. These include changes in rainfall and in the upwelling of carbon from deep within the sea, each of which is a product of the natural dynamics of the climate system. It merely happens, he suggested, that "temperature shows a rise somewhat ahead of the increase in carbon dioxide."</p>
        <p>Dr. Keeling has analyzed the relationship in which temperature fluctuations precede carbon dioxide fluctuations over the course of the El Nino cycle. In that cycle, incompletely understood natural factors cause sea-surface temperatures in the eastern equatorial Pacific to warm every two to six years, touching off worldwide changes in weather. Dr. Keeling argues that these meteorological changes could be responsible for the fluctuations in carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>Other scientists say that although the temporary atmospheric warming produced by El Nino is comparable to that expected to result from human-induced global warming, the amount of carbon dioxide produced in El Nino years is trivial. Clues From Ancient Ice</p>
        <p>But, said Dr. Oppenheimer, "we've shown that there's a lot more at work here than El Nino," since the latest study shows that changes in carbon dioxide follow temperature changes over many time scales, from 1 year to 30. In this, the findings generally confirm a 1990 study by Cynthia Kuo, Craig Lindberg and David J. Thomson of A.T.&amp;T. Bell Labs.</p>
        <p>The most recent study goes beyond the 1990 report to speculate that changes in carbon dioxide may follow changes in temperature over even longer time scales. These longer periods are the ones in which any global warming brought about by human emissions of heat-trapping gases would take place, since the effect of the gases is felt only over decades.</p>
        <p>By analyzing temperature and chemical records preserved in ancient ice over the last 160,000 years, climatologists have also found a correlation between carbon dioxide and temperature over millennial time scales. But because these measurements are less precise than measurements of modern-day temperature, they do not allow scientists to say with confidence whether changes in warming precede changes in carbon dioxide or vice versa. Dr. Oppenheimer and others have argued in the past that the ancient correlation provides evidence that rises in carbon dioxide have caused temperatures to rise.</p>
        <p>That would still be true over long time scales, he said, "because it takes a long time for the greenhouse effect to take hold."</p>
        <p>Moreover, he said, cause and effect could change over time, as various forces are brought into play at different times and at different rates. "Over a shorter time scale," Dr. Oppenheimer said, "it is pretty clear that temperature precedes carbon dioxide. The reason for that is that the greenhouse effect doesn't get going over these short time scales. Over longer time scales, it does." Billions of Tons, Moving</p>
        <p>Scientists say that statistical correlations of the kind that underlie the recent studies are weak indicators unless there is also a plausible mechanism to explain the supposed relationship between temperature and carbon dioxide. Dr. Woodwell and others have identified a number of such possible mechanisms, all of them related to natural movements of carbon dioxide in and out of the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Under natural conditions, billions of tons of carbon move between the atmosphere, on one hand, and the oceans, forests, grasslands, wetlands and soils, on the other. Only a small fraction of this carbon is in the atmosphere at any one time, in the form of carbon dioxide. This, along with methane, is what traps enough heat from the sun to make life possible, scientists say.</p>
        <p>Additional carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels is not the only way in which atmospheric concentrations can grow. Dr. Woodwell says that a warmer atmosphere would cause photosynthesis in plants to increase, using up some carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>But the amount used would be small, he said, compared with the carbon dioxide that plants would pour back into the atmosphere as a result of increased respiration, the process in which energy is burned. The result would be a net increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide. More carbon dioxide would also be released as warmer temperatures speeded the decay of organic matter, he said, and more methane would be released as frozen bogs in the north began to thaw.</p>
        <p>How all of this would actually affect the course of future warming "cannot be determined until our inadvertent global warming experiment is well under way," Dr. Oppenheimer said. Possible Mechanisms for Warming Some scientists believe that global warming would unlock naturally stored carbon dioxide and methane. Thawing boge would release methane and plant decay would release carbon dioxide. Warming would stimulate photosynthesis, drawing some carbon dioxide from the air. But plant respiration would produce much more. (Source: Dr. George Woodwell)</p>
