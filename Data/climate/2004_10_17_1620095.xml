        <p>THE Times is not pro-Bush in the way that The Washington Times is pro-Bush, slamming John Kerry with Vietnam falsehoods week after week.</p>
        <p>But The Times's decorous approach to the news has often helped President Bush in three significant ways: by equating his gross deceptions with Mr. Kerry's minor lapses; by omitting or burying news of administration activities and their consequences; and by missing the deep pattern of Mr. Bush's prejudices and malfeasances.</p>
        <p>First of all, The Times's news columns are loath to call untruth untruth. (Space being short, I will skip over the nice question of when Mr. Bush is knowingly lying, when he is half-lying, when he is clumsily improvising, when he is deluding himself, and when he is asserting what a reasonable person would know to be untrue.) Stenography often substitutes for research. Look at The Times at its most pungent -- a rare roundup piece that landed on Page A19, Oct. 8, headlined: ''In His New Attacks, Bush Pushes Limit on the Facts.''</p>
        <p>The article explains that ''the White House has charted new ground with the sweep of its negative campaigning,'' taking its ''attacks to a blistering new level,'' so that, ''several analysts say, Mr. Bush pushed the limits of subjective interpretation and offered exaggerated or what some Democrats said were distorted accounts.''</p>
        <p>New level? Pushed the limits? What some Democrats said? The authors, Adam Nagourney and Richard W. Stevenson, offer evidence that President Bush exaggerated and distorted what Mr. Kerry meant by pre-emptive attacks' passing a global test. Then why mince words?</p>
        <p>The Times's generosity toward government claims about Al Qaeda-Saddam connections and Iraqi W.M.D. has been amply documented, even, belatedly, in The Times itself. But on other fronts as well, The Times cuts Mr. Bush plenty of slack. One reason is that The Times, like other top media, scants the substance of the candidates' views in favor of their tactics and strategies. But when the president is a serial obfuscator and fabricator -- not to say flip-flopper -- this inside-dopester coverage works to his advantage.</p>
        <p>Consider the disproportion between The Times's attention to Mr. Kerry's Vietnam battles and its inattention to Mr. Bush's business career of failing upward: improving his fortunes while his companies failed. How did he succeed in making big money when his oil company, Harken Energy, nearly collapsed? Too often, as the president himself might say, Mr. Bush can run, and The Times lets him hide.</p>
        <p>So can Vice President Dick Cheney. Though Mr. Cheney has denied it, Halliburton, during the years he headed it, did $73 million of business with Saddam Hussein. The Washington Post looked into the story thoroughly. Over the past four years, The Times hasn't once done so in its news pages. Would The Times have let Bill Clinton get away with trading with tyrants? Wouldn't such a story have been at least as newsworthy as the disastrous Whitewater investment that the paper examined endlessly on its front page?</p>
        <p>Indeed, The Times frequently buries revelations of administration malfeasance. Coverage of declining environmental standards is spotty, though sometimes extensive. The subject of climate change has made the front page seven times in the past two years; some will think this more than enough, but if the issues are really as grave as most scientists believe, it's the least a serious newspaper ought to do.</p>
        <p>Third, The Times leaves dots unconnected. The Republican Party doesn't incidentally or occasionally stoop to please big corporations. It does so systematically. The administration and its Congressional allies regularly permit lobbyists to write the regulations by which they themselves are to be regulated. Last May, The Denver Post reported: ''President Bush has installed more than 100 top officials who were once lobbyists, attorneys or spokespeople for the industries they oversee.'' But the infrequent Times article citing examples of such fox-henhouse cohabitation in coal, say, does not refer to examples from drug, hospital, utility, oil and gas and other sectors (as did The Post).</p>
        <p>It was refreshing, nevertheless, to see The Times last week devoting front page space to the Senate's $136 billion corporate tax cut. Where are the similar rundowns of who benefits from other government policies? True, an on-again, off-again watchdog is better than no watchdog at all. But Times readers should not have to settle for a watchdog with laryngitis.</p>
