        <p>The Thinking Apple Tree</p>
        <p>Q. Last year, there was a drought; this year, my apple tree made it up with a bumper crop. Do trees have memories?</p>
        <p>A. ''Apple trees do, in a sense, have a memory,'' said Dr. Marvin P. Pritts, professor of horticulture at the Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. ''The buds for flowers and fruit for next year are formed in late summer, so the size of next year's crop is determined already.''</p>
        <p>''Apples are notorious for biennial bearing,'' he continued, meaning big crops one year are followed by small crops the next. Growers often thin out small apples in early June, allowing the trees to grow and produce enough buds for the next year's crop, he said, ''so that it's not feast or famine but steady as she goes.''</p>
        <p>Bud formation is controlled by plant hormones and by how much carbon dioxide the leaves process in photosynthesis. ''If there is a lot of fruit,'' Dr. Pritts explained, ''less sunlight reaches the leaves'' for photosynthesis. That means the tree has less energy for making flower buds. The same holds true for other fruit trees.</p>
        <p>''To predict next year's crop, look to the preceding fall,'' Dr. Pritts said. ''Enough moisture, mild temperatures and plenty of sunshine contribute to a big crop the following year.'' A drought probably does not make a big difference to a big tree with a big root structure, he said, but a severe drought, especially in late summer, could have a severely detrimental effect on a small tree.</p>
