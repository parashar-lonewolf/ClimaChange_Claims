        <p>There should be no easier target for a satirist than the current administration in Washington. Alas, ''The View From K Street Steak,'' a new play by Walt Stepp at Altered Stages, misses with just about every shot and proves how elusive the business of getting a laugh can be.</p>
        <p>The play is billed as a political comedy, but there is nothing remotely funny in its 17 scenes, and the sole political focus seems to be the lobbying scandals spawned by Jack Abramoff more than a year ago. When it comes to political comedy, yesterday's headlines are already too old.</p>

        <p>There should be no easier target for a satirist than the current administration in Washington. Alas, ''The View From K Street Steak,'' a new play by Walt Stepp at Altered Stages, misses with just about every shot and proves how elusive the business of getting a laugh can be.</p>
        <p>The play is billed as a political comedy, but there is nothing remotely funny in its 17 scenes, and the sole political focus seems to be the lobbying scandals spawned by Jack Abramoff more than a year ago. When it comes to political comedy, yesterday's headlines are already too old.</p>
        <p>The setup for ''The View From K Street Steak,'' produced by Cinna Productions, consists of a ventriloquist act performing at a political retreat in Reno, Nev. The ventriloquist and dummy, both played by humans and neither of whom would make one pine for vaudeville, deliver patter between scenes in which lobbyists, journalists and pols wheel and deal in hotel rooms. The title, which carries the subtitle ''Capitol Puppets &amp; Breadfellows,'' refers to a restaurant back in Washington.</p>
        <p>There is one scene (No. 10 for those keeping count) that provides a spark of life. An alcoholic senator confronts a holier-than-thou televangelist at a party and gives him what-for on his denial of global warming and the hypocrisy of his opposing both abortion and day care.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately the rest of the play is simply confusing and boring. It's hard to tell from the snippets of dialogue just what or who is being bought and sold, and the text has so many dated references that the younger actors probably had to Google some of the names -- Tab Hunter, Cesar Romero, Red Skelton and Deborah Kerr, for example -- that come up in conversation. There is even mention of a mimeograph machine and a joke about airline stewardesses now being called flight attendants.</p>
        <p>Tom Herman's rather wooden direction does little to help the cause. A game cast of eight, playing 17 roles, throws a lot of effort into the exercise, but energy alone goes only so far. Bill Tatum has the best moment as the irate senator.</p>
        <p>''The View From K Street Steak'' continues through May 5 at Altered Stages, 212 West 29th Street, Chelsea; (212) 352-3101.</p>
        <p>THEATER REVIEW</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 7, 2007, Monday  A theater review on April 20 about ''The View From K Street Steak,'' at Altered Stages in Chelsea, referred incorrectly to the setting at the start of the play. While the first scene is titled ''Reno,'' the play is set, according to the program, at a political retreat at a Hilton Head spa and resort ''and similar expense-account playgrounds.'' The retreat is not in Reno, Nev.</p>
