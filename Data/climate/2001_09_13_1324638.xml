        <p>Officials have canceled or are preparing to cancel at least two major international meetings in Washington and New York that had been expected to attract heads of state and other top world leaders.</p>
        <p>The United Nations General Assembly voted today to postpone indefinitely a special session on children, which it had scheduled for Sept. 19 to Sept. 21 in New York. About 80 world leaders, including President Bush, had been expected to attend.</p>
        <p>Officials of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund also said they expected that their annual meeting, an event scheduled for Washington that was widely considered a prime target of antiglobalization protesters, would be canceled. The Bush administration said today that it had not decided whether to cancel the session, from Sept. 28 to Sept. 29.</p>
        <p>The police in Washington said it should not be held. ''I don't think it takes a brain surgeon to see that's not the best idea right now,'' Chief Charles H. Ramsey said.</p>
        <p>The bank and the I.M.F. have held  annual meetings of member governments each year since their founding shortly after World War II.</p>
        <p>Officials of the United Nations, the World Bank and the I.M.F. said they worried about holding large gatherings of world leaders because the coordinated terrorist attacks in New York and Washington had strained security forces.</p>
        <p>It is unclear whether the heightened fears of attacks will encourage leaders to forego or scale back other international gatherings that have become showpieces of globalization. Such forums are high-profile arenas for officials, business leaders, medical experts and others to share ideas and harmonize approaches to global problems.</p>
        <p>Given the Middle Eastern site and the possibility of reprisals against suspected terrorists, questions have also been raised about a trade meeting in November in Doha, Qatar. A spokesman for the World Trade Organization said there had been no change in plans for the session, where leaders hope to agree to liberalize trade rules.</p>
        <p>Even before the attacks on Tuesday, political leaders and police officials around the world have complained about the high cost of providing security for visiting dignitaries. Leaders at recent international financial meetings in Seattle, Prague, Montreal and Genoa have encountered demonstrations by protesters who oppose economic integration.</p>
        <p>Anarchist cells among the demonstrators have used violence to attract attention, often damaging property and turning urban centers into combat zones. In Genoa, the police fatally shot one demonstrator in July at a summit meeting of industrialized nations.</p>
        <p>Last week, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy asked the United Nations, which had planned a food summit meeting in early November in Rome, to find another site. He said that after the Genoa incident he felt that the food meeting would put ancient ruins at risk.</p>
        <p>A senior United Nations official who helps arrange its frequent global conferences, Shashi Tharoor, said the postponement of the New York session on children and the relocation of the Rome meetings were onetime events, not indicators that global summit meetings had become impossible. He said that if such meetings were scaled back, a vital tool for spreading economic, environmental and social policies would be lost.</p>
        <p>''These meetings have an enormously important role in crystalizing thinking, building consensus and promoting action,'' Mr. Tharoor said. ''You look at any issue like global warming, AIDS, sustainable development -- these got a major boost from global summits.''</p>
        <p>Financial meetings are perhaps the most vulnerable in the current environment. Protest threats in Washington had already forced the World Bank and the I.M.F. to shorten their annual meeting to two days from five and to prepare to cordon off a site downtown with a nine-foot-high wall.</p>
        <p>Officials at the two agencies said the threats had forced them to cancel the most open parts of their meetings, when developing countries, bankers, officials and accredited groups mingled with one another at conferences and cocktail parties.</p>
        <p>Some protest groups have celebrated in the past when financial leaders were forced to curtail meetings. But mainstream protesters say they aimed to open up such conclaves, not end them, and they expressed concern today that terrorist events might force a cancellation.</p>
        <p>''We too are handicapped in our ability to reach out to the public and get our message out'' if the meeting are canceled, said Soren Ambrose, a protest organizer with one group, 50 Years Are Enough.</p>
