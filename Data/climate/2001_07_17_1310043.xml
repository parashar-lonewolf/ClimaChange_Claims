        <p>In a setback for the Cuban exile lobby and its Congressional allies, President Bush said today that he would not activate the harshest sanction of a law that seeks to punish foreigners for investing in property in Cuba that was confiscated by the Havana government.</p>
        <p>The sanction, Title III of the Helms-Burton Act of 1996, would allow American corporations and citizens to sue foreign companies that use the expropriated properties for profit.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>In a setback for the Cuban exile lobby and its Congressional allies, President Bush said today that he would not activate the harshest sanction of a law that seeks to punish foreigners for investing in property in Cuba that was confiscated by the Havana government.</p>
        <p>The sanction, Title III of the Helms-Burton Act of 1996, would allow American corporations and citizens to sue foreign companies that use the expropriated properties for profit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said in a statement that his decision was ''necessary for the national interest of the United States and will expedite the transition to democracy in Cuba.'' It appears to be aimed in part at avoiding a battle with European countries, which are critical of his policies on missile defense and global warming and see Helms-Burton as the United States legislating beyond its borders.</p>
        <p>President Clinton waived the Title III provision throughout his second term.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's decision raises the likelihood that the full force of Helms-Burton will never take effect, Cuba experts said.</p>
        <p>''If Clinton never imposed it, and this Republican president isn't going to, it's basically a dead letter,'' said Philip Peters, vice president of the Lexington Institute, a research organization that promotes market ideology.</p>
        <p>Hard-line critics of the Cuban president, Fidel Castro, expressed dismay at the suspension, but they were quick to say Mr. Bush's approach to Cuba was preferable to Mr. Clinton's more conciliatory stance.</p>
        <p>''Certainly before anybody jumps on the president for this six-month suspension, it would be wise to consider the other salutary initiatives that the president is putting into force,'' said Senator Jesse Helms, a chief sponsor of the bill and the ranking Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee. ''The president is, in fact, taking a very tough line, which is certain to make Fidel Castro squirm.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush on Friday announced plans to strengthen the trade embargo by enforcing limits on cash payments that Cuban-Americans may send their relatives on the island and preventing American tourists from going there. He ordered officials to ''use all available means'' to overcome Havana's jamming of United States government broadcasts and promised additional support for human rights activists and dissidents.</p>
        <p>Commenting on the Title III suspension, Dennis Hays, vice president of the Cuban-American National Foundation, the largest exile lobby, said, ''We understand that the president has a bigger picture in mind, and we're prepared to accept his judgment that now is not the time.''</p>
        <p>Still, Democratic critics of Helms-Burton appeared to relish Mr. Bush's predicament. He is determined to pay back Cuban-American supporters, they said, but is worried about stirring an international furor that could haunt him in other policy arenas.</p>
