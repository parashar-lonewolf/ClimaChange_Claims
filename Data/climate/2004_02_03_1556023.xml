        <p>The budget submitted on Monday by President Bush was good news for some departments and agencies and not-so-good news for others.</p>
        <p>The Bush administration's budget for energy programs offers almost $7.2 billion in tax breaks over 10 years to promote energy production and conservation, far less than the $25 billion sought by Congress in the energy legislation now stalled on Capitol Hill.</p>
        <p>In apparent recognition that the broad bill might not succeed, the budget also emphasizes money for individual energy projects favored by the administration, including $228 million in 2005 for research into a hydrogen fuel cell, an increase of 42 percent over 2004.</p>
        <p>There is also $275 million for work on a coal-burning power plant that would capture its emissions of carbon dioxide, a global warming gas, for long-term storage, as well as its other pollutants.</p>
        <p>The spending plan assumes the administration will win approval to begin oil and gas production in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, estimating royalty payments of $2.4 billion in 2006 with about half that amount to be spent on alternative energy programs. But the Senate has repeatedly blocked opening the refuge to drilling, a position it does not seem likely to change this year.</p>
        <p>While proposals to upgrade the nation's power grid remain bogged down in the energy measure, the administration proposes to spend $91 million on efforts to modernize the power transmission infrastructure.</p>
        <p>The budget calls for spending $7.4 billion to clean up sites contaminated with radioactivity from nuclear weapons production and research and provides a $303 million increase, to $880 million, to continue development of a nuclear waste depository in Nevada.</p>
