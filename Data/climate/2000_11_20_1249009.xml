        <p>A novel legal strategy aimed at reducing smog and acid rain in the Northeast yielded a huge victory on Wednesday when the Virginia Electric Power Company agreed to spend $1.2 billion to cut harmful pollutants from eight coal-burning plants by 70 percent. This is the biggest settlement -- in dollar terms, as well as promised reduction in pollutants -- in the 30-year history of the 1970 Clean Air Act. It sets the stage for further such settlements that, over time, could lead to substantial reductions in two pollutants that are blown eastward from power plants in the border states and the Midwest -- sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain, and nitrogen oxides, which contribute to smog.</p>
        <p>The settlement flows in part from a decision last year by New York's attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, to see if an untested provision of the Clean Air Act could be used against some of the country's dirtiest power plants. In general, the act ''grandfathered'' coal-fired plants built before 1970, exempting them from the law's pollution standards in expectation that they would eventually be closed.  Most such plants are still in business, producing far more pollution than modern plants. But the act also specified that when older plants were modernized to make appreciably more energy, they had to comply with the same emission standards as new plants.</p>

        <p>A novel legal strategy aimed at reducing smog and acid rain in the Northeast yielded a huge victory on Wednesday when the Virginia Electric Power Company agreed to spend $1.2 billion to cut harmful pollutants from eight coal-burning plants by 70 percent. This is the biggest settlement -- in dollar terms, as well as promised reduction in pollutants -- in the 30-year history of the 1970 Clean Air Act. It sets the stage for further such settlements that, over time, could lead to substantial reductions in two pollutants that are blown eastward from power plants in the border states and the Midwest -- sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain, and nitrogen oxides, which contribute to smog.</p>
        <p>The settlement flows in part from a decision last year by New York's attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, to see if an untested provision of the Clean Air Act could be used against some of the country's dirtiest power plants. In general, the act ''grandfathered'' coal-fired plants built before 1970, exempting them from the law's pollution standards in expectation that they would eventually be closed.  Most such plants are still in business, producing far more pollution than modern plants. But the act also specified that when older plants were modernized to make appreciably more energy, they had to comply with the same emission standards as new plants.</p>
        <p>Last September, Mr. Spitzer announced suits against 17 plants in five states, including Virginia Electric Power, for making major modifications without installing required pollution controls. The announcement followed months of painstaking investigation into company and state records, aimed at establishing that the companies had upgraded while hiding behind the grandfather clause.</p>
        <p>Six weeks later, the federal Environmental Protection Agency filed suit against more than 100 plants across a much wider swath of the country. The E.P.A. had in fact been mulling an approach similar to New York's for several months. But Mr. Spitzer's action helped embolden an agency that was already at war on several other fronts with Congress and the power companies on clean air issues. The E.P.A. suits have also produced one settlement, an agreement by the Tampa Electric Company to spend $1 billion to switch one plant from coal to natural gas, a much cleaner fuel.</p>
        <p>The fact that Washington and New York are pursuing the same course is one more signal to utilities that own aging, coal-fired plants that they are running out of places to hide from regulators at the federal and state levels. They would be wise to accept the consequences of the law and install the pollution controls they should have built years ago.</p>
