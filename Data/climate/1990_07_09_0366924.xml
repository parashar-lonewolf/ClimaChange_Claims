        <p>LEAD: President Bush plans to tell the United States' six main industrial allies this week that he is prepared to send teams of experts to the Soviet Union to help it rebuild rail and communications networks, grain storage sites, food distribution systems and other essential services, senior White House officials said today.</p>
        <p>President Bush plans to tell the United States' six main industrial allies this week that he is prepared to send teams of experts to the Soviet Union to help it rebuild rail and communications networks, grain storage sites, food distribution systems and other essential services, senior White House officials said today.</p>
        <p>Disclosing this on the eve of the three-day economic summit meeting here of the leaders of the Group of Seven industrial countries, the White House officials emphasized that Mr. Bush continued to oppose a move for large financial aid to the Soviet Union, as proposed by West Germany and France.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's view is that the allies should agree in principle to help President Mikhail S. Gorbachev bring about economic changes in the Soviet Union, but that each should act individually.</p>
        <p>'Different Political Imperatives'</p>
        <p>''Each country has different political imperatives,'' one official said. ''The President is happy to have each one help the Soviet Union in complementary ways.''</p>
        <p>Whatever their differences, a top American official said today, the leaders were determined to avoid a shouting match over Soviet assistance. The leaders do not want to increase pressure on Mr. Gorbachev because the news from the Communist Party Congress in Moscow last week convinced them that the Soviet leader was even weaker politically than they had thought.</p>
        <p>Consequently, aid to the Soviet Union is likely to take a back seat to other matters when this first post-cold war economic summit meeting opens here on Monday, officials from the United States, Japan, Britain, West Germany, Italy, France and Canada said.</p>
        <p>Contrast With London Meeting</p>
        <p>President Bush will find himself at odds with the leaders of the industrial allies on central points involving international trade and protection of the environment, and this could set off some fireworks. As a result, the tone may be in sharp contrast with the NATO meeting in London last week, where the allied leaders basically adopted the course Mr. Bush charted for military policy and East-West relations.</p>
        <p>Here, the President seems likely to fail in what his aides describe as his primary mission - to persuade the other countries to abolish or at least limit their farm subsidies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush maintains that worldwide economic growth depends on the successful completion of the current round of trade talks and that those talks are doomed unless agriculture policies in the industrial countries are changed.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Bush is, as a Canadian diplomat here said, ''all alone'' in his reluctance to adopt an international strategy for dealing with global warming.</p>
        <p>On aid to the Soviet Union, Marlin Fitzwater, President Bush's spokesman, said Mr. Bush did plan to discuss with the other leaders the letter he received from Mr. Gorbachev last week requesting economic assistance from the allies. The letter was seen by top diplomats as underscoring Mr. Gorbachev's political difficulties.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fitzwater said the letter repeated topics raised in discussions Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev had in Washington this spring and did not ''raise any new issues or requests.''</p>
        <p>The leaders understand that they have different domestic political needs when it comes to dealing with the Soviet Union, the officials said.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Bush wants to avoid the fire from the right wing of the Republican Party that he would surely receive if he asked for money for the Soviet Union when that country was continuing to aid Cuba. On the other hand, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany, who has pledged more than $3 billion to the Soviet Union, is eager for Soviet acquiescence in a unified Germany's membership in NATO.</p>
        <p>Special Paris-Moscow Link</p>
        <p>And President Francois Mitterrand of France wants to build a special relationship between Paris and Moscow.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada opposes direct financial assistance to the Soviet Union, but he broke slightly with the United States today by saying that Canada might support some forms of credit for Moscow.</p>
        <p>Neither the agriculture nor the environment issue is likely to be settled here this week. ''Detailed and complicated negotiations cannot take place at summits,'' said Henry R. Nau, a professor at George Washington University, who was Ronald Reagan's personal representative at several summit meetings in the early 1980's.</p>
        <p>But the three days of talks will focus such attention on the disagreements that Mr. Bush, the host of the meeting, will be hard pressed to maintain the harmony of London.</p>
        <p>The leaders of the Group of Seven nations began arriving here over the weekend.</p>
        <p>Sessions With Each Leader</p>
        <p>In addition to group meetings and dinners, President Bush plans to hold one-on-one sessions with each of the leaders. He met Saturday with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan and today with Mr. Mulroney.</p>
        <p>The group has been meeting once a year since 1975, when the main topic was the explosion of worldwide oil prices. As world economic problems have changed over the years, so have the topics of the meetings.</p>
        <p>Administration officials say President Bush wants international trade to be the main emphasis of the Houston meeting. ''From the President's point of view, there is nothing more important than the Uruguay Round,'' said Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, speaking of the current trade liberalization talks that began in Punta del Este, Uruguay, in 1986 and are scheduled to wind up in December.</p>
        <p>If the industrial countries do not lift their farm subsidies, the Administration fears, many developing countries will abandon the trade talks. Agricultural products are their main contribution to the world's markets. The result, American officials say, could be a breakdown of the free trade system. The allies, according to this view, might then divide into protectionist blocs, and the consequence would be to stifle world economic growth.</p>
        <p>The European Community sets high tariffs on meat, fruits, vegetables and feed grains, subsidizes exports to make them more competitive overseas and gives generous support payments to farmers. Japan prohibits the importation of rice and keeps its domestic rice prices at many times the world market price.</p>
        <p>Potent Political Force</p>
        <p>Farmers in those countries are a potent political force. There are 10 million farmers in the European Community countries compared with two million in the United States, although the entire population in Europe is only slightly larger.</p>
        <p>The United States and Canada, where farming is the most efficient in the world, are prepared to lift their trade restrictions, officials say, if the other countries go along. But a senior official of the European Community said he did not expect any concessions on this point.</p>
        <p>Japanese Loans to China</p>
        <p>TOKYO, Monday, July 9 (Reuters) - Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Misoji Sakamoto said today that Japan would unfreeze loans to China some time after this week's summit of industrialized democracies in Houston.</p>
        <p>Kyodo News Agency quoted Mr. Sakamoto as telling a news conference here, ''I think loans to China will be resumed on Japan's own decision, in good time, after the Houston summit.''</p>
