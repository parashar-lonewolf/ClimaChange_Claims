        <p>Re ''Bush Directive Increases Sway on Regulation'' (front page, Jan. 30):</p>
        <p>While the Bush administration continues its quixotic mission to bring democracy to Iraq, it continues to find innovative ways to limit democracy here at home.</p>
        <p>Under the pretext of shedding more light on the regulations and guidance documents issued by regulatory agencies, the White House, you report, is requiring federal agencies to have ''a regulatory policy office run by a political appointee, to supervise the development of rules and documents providing guidance to regulated industries.''</p>
        <p>This effort has but one purpose: to subvert the traditional regulatory process under which ''civil servants and scientific experts'' have taken the lead in shaping rules interpreting laws passed by Congress.</p>
        <p>The Bush administration's initiative would undermine our civil service system and further politicize the administrative process, while adversely affecting the ability of regulatory agencies to protect the public.</p>
        <p>Jay N. Feldman  Port Washington, N.Y.  Jan. 30, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>President Bush's directive is simply another example of the president politicizing processes that have historically been nonpartisan. It demonstrates once again his distrust of science and empirical evidence.</p>
        <p>The statement by Jeffrey A. Rosen, the White House Office of Management and Budget's general counsel, that ''this is a classic good-government measure that will make federal agencies more open and accountable'' is pure Orwellian Newspeak.</p>
        <p>It is the opposite of good government. It is a mechanism to allow big business to avoid regulations that help the people in general but might hurt their bottom line.</p>
        <p>Gordon Nash  Oakland Gardens, Queens  Jan. 30, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>So the Bush administration has finally codified its longtime practice of politicizing the promulgation of new government regulations.</p>
        <p>No doubt the political appointees who will oversee environmental, health, safety and civil rights regulations are cost-conscious folks. So while they consider the financial impact of proposed regulations on their wealthy backers, will they also think about the health costs to all citizens of not enforcing clean air standards, the ecological costs of not protecting wetlands, or the environmental costs of not addressing global warming?</p>
        <p>I doubt it.</p>
        <p>Edward M. Pawlak  West Hartford, Conn., Jan. 30, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I don't get it. When President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia strengthens his capacity to regulate government operations, Bush administration hawks rightly question his respect for critical legislative controls. When a weakened President Bush uses similar tactics, however, these same people suggest that an authoritative executive branch is both necessary and beneficial.</p>
        <p>Is this the difference a ''democracy'' makes?</p>
        <p>Jaye Jones  Chicago, Jan. 30, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Now President Bush will require agencies to identify ''the specific market failure'' that justifies government intervention.</p>
        <p>Markets allow many good things to happen, and when a market failure can be identified, intervention is often justified. But should market failure be the only reason for government intervention?</p>
        <p>Such a rule implies that markets are not just good, but the singular ultimate goal of human society. That philosophy sounds like yet another religion that the Bush administration wants us to take on faith.</p>
        <p>Bruce Burger  Seattle, Jan. 30, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I guess we can kiss goodbye to the Republican commitment to get government off our backs.</p>
