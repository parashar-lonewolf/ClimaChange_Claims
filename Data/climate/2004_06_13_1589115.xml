        <p>IN ''The Day After Tomorrow,'' the disaster movie, millions die while politicians and scientists squabble about global warming.</p>
        <p>Real life, of course, is a bit more complicated. For more than a decade, there has been a fierce international debate over how to curb the buildup of heat-trapping greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. While the environmental results of the dispute may not be clear for years, some economic consequences are already apparent.</p>
        <p>On one side of the argument is the United States government, which opposes mandatory caps on emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. On the other are more than 100 nations, including most of the developed world, that have signed the treaty known as the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto signatories have agreed that developed nations will cut greenhouse gas emissions by 2012 to a level 5.2 percent below the total in 1990. To reach that goal, each nation is expected to establish caps on its various polluters, caps that add up to the requisite cuts.</p>
        <p>The Bush administration rejects this approach, arguing that mandatory caps and big cuts in emissions may damage the economy. Instead, it has set a more modest goal: slowing the growth rate of emissions. It proposes to do that by subsidizing new technology and by encouraging voluntary programs in private industry.</p>
        <p>The chasm between the two approaches appears to be having an unintended effect. It may be undermining the development of what all sides agree is one of the most effective available tools for reducing pollutants in the atmosphere: the trading of pollution allowances. Use of that tool, strongly advocated by the United States during the Kyoto negotiations, is embodied in the Kyoto agreement.</p>
        <p>In the United States, trading in pollution allowances has already helped reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, the main contributor to acid rain, and has helped speed up the elimination of ozone-depleting chemicals. The principle behind it is simple: if a utility, for example, finds that it would cost $1 million for equipment to meet government standards for sulfur dioxide emissions, it has two choices: buy the equipment, or buy a pollution allowance from a company that has already cut emissions by more than the standards require.</p>
        <p>The trading has helped clarify which companies can cut emissions the most for the dollars they invest, and has given efficient companies an incentive to get started.</p>
        <p>But successful trading has been confined to a handful of pollutants emitted by a relatively small number of businesses that must comply with specific emissions caps set by the government. Most policy experts are dubious that such trading can solve a global problem affecting a wide range of gases and industries, particularly if the United States, the world's largest emitter of such gases, refuses to set any caps.</p>
        <p>''From an economic view, emissions aren't a true market,'' said Peter Fusaro, chairman of Global Change Associates, an energy and environmental risk consulting service. Without regulated caps, and penalties for failure to comply, companies have no way to know what an investment in curbing them is worth, according to Mr. Fusaro and other experts.</p>
        <p>Some trading in emissions allowances for greenhouse gases has begun anyway. While the Kyoto Protocol isn't binding on its signers -- it won't become so unless Russia makes good on President Vladimir V. Putin's pledge that his nation will join -- the European Union has already adopted an emissions program that complies with the treaty's terms. In Europe, trading has started in the emissions allowances issued by European Union members, and in credits given for projects that cut emissions.</p>
        <p>In the United States, California and states in the Northeast are moving to impose regulations that may fill the void in emission caps left by the Bush administration. In the meantime, a group called the Chicago Climate Exchange has been formed to pursue a private approach to trading in emissions allowances, and the Bush administration has endorsed its efforts. Led by members like American Electric Power, DuPont, International Paper and Ford Motor, the exchange created a framework defining how to measure, report and audit emissions and credits for cutting them.</p>
        <p>Each participating company agreed to cut emissions 1 percent annually for four years, starting last year, either through its own projects or by buying credits for cuts made by others. They began trading in December. The exchange calls itself a pilot program and says its goal is to explore trading in greenhouse gases, not to set itself up as the arbiter of which cuts are needed to combat global warming.</p>
        <p>SO far, the results suggest that businesses and investors do not see the makings of a serious market in this voluntary approach. How can one tell? Even though trading is thin everywhere, prices are far higher in Europe, where government-mandated emissions caps begin taking effect next year.</p>
        <p>At the Chicago prices, the signal from the market is that only the most minimal investments make economic sense.</p>
        <p>Some environmental advocates say opposition from the Bush administration to emissions caps has heartened companies that are trying to roll back the emissions limits in Europe. In this view, prices have declined in Europe this year because of market fears that European policy makers will retreat, reducing the incentive for companies to invest in emissions cuts.</p>
        <p>This may not be a disaster, but it is hardly a recipe for reducing the risk of global warming.</p>
