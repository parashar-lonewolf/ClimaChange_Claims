        <p>WITH the price of home heating oil and gasoline near 10-year highs, President Clinton recently released 30 million gallons of oil from the nation's strategic reserve, saying he was concerned about cost and supply over the coming winter. Those developments once again prompt questions about alternatives to fossil fuels. Are we any closer to substitutes for crude oil? Has someone invented a car that runs on water?</p>
        <p>The answer, from an informal survey of the patents issued to engineers, automotive corporations and individual scientists, is not yet.</p>
        <p>Synthetic fuels exist, and automobile manufacturers are already producing electric cars and internal combustion engines that run on grain-alcohol fuels. But a quick glance at patents issued in the last several years reveals little new in the way of alternative fuels for running vehicles or heating houses.</p>
        <p>In fact, in the last two years, only one patent has been issued that describes itself as a vehicle engine powered by alternative fuel. That is hardly a definitive statement on the state of research into new engines and fuels, but it does demonstrate that new technologies are not about to make their commercial debut any time soon.</p>
        <p>The single patent was issued to Herman Anderson of Brentwood, Tenn. Mr. Anderson developed an engine that runs on hydrogen gas, a fuel that has held some promise for years. Several other inventors have won patents using hydrogen to power small engines. But the gas is also problematic.</p>
        <p>Because its mass energy density is low, hydrogen gas needs to be significantly compressed to create useful energy levels. That makes it difficult to generate enough power to run a car. And though the gas is hard to ignite when it is cool, heating it can cause premature ignition and backfiring.</p>
        <p>All of these faults are carefully described in the patent awarded last month to Mr. Anderson, his second patent for a similar technology. He says his engine overcomes the drawbacks of hydrogen with an adapter he installed between the spark plug and cylinder in an internal combustion engine. The adapter contains a plug with a grooved surface and a protruding electrode. When hydrogen is forced through the adapter, it flows over the grooves and is mixed with oxygen taken in through a carburetor. The grooves create a tornado of hydrogen and air that heads toward the engine cylinder.</p>
        <p>''The stratified hydrogen-air mixture is compressed in the compression stroke of the engine via a piston and push rod, which are standard structures in an internal combustion engine,'' Mr. Anderson wrote in his patent. He uses a spark plug modified to create a hotter spark than necessary in conventional engines, so the voltage will be great enough to light the hydrogen.</p>
        <p>He said his system would also ''provide reduced or zero emission of environmentally harmful gases.'' Mr. Anderson received patent 6,119,651.</p>
        <p>Among the dozens of recent patents for technologies related to internal combustion engines, there are inventions for fuel additives, fuel-injection systems, methods and devices that reduce fuel emissions, and for electric vehicles. But the engine that runs on water or some other renewable resource still seems elusive.</p>
        <p>Another idea for a useful alternative fuel comes from a patent awarded to William Hubbard and Reginald Spencer.</p>
        <p>Their invention makes it possible to store a spare gallon or two of fuel in a car trunk for those occasions when a driver runs out of gas. Carrying extra gasoline in that manner is illegal in many places because gas is so volatile that sparks can ignite its fumes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hubbard and Mr. Spencer, who are from Baltimore, say they have eliminated that dangerous flash point from their emergency fuel by replacing the butane and pentane in gasoline with mineral spirits.</p>
        <p>''A great many different refined mineral spirits, petroleum distillates and petrochemicals as well as oxygenated solvents and chemicals can be used if they fall within the desired flash point parameters and meet the other requirements,'' like octane levels, the inventors write in their patent.</p>
        <p>The fuel is packaged in a plastic container with a spout, and a seal that cannot be replaced, once removed, to prevent refilling the container with an inappropriate fuel. Mr. Hubbard and Mr. Spencer received patent 6,113,660.</p>
        <p>Pumping fuel into a car can be difficult for the disabled. Gasoline pumps have to be protected from the cars that drive up to them, so they are usually installed on concrete islands or partly surrounded by barriers. Three inventors from Greensboro, N.C., realized that such safety measures made it impossible for people in wheelchairs to reach the control panels of self-serve gas pumps.</p>
        <p>''Other forms of disability make it difficult or impossible to operate the fueling nozzle, read displayed instructions or values on the display screen of the gasoline dispenser or hear the voice of the attendant over an intercom,'' the inventors, John McSpadden, David Kaehler and Timothy Dickson, wrote in their patent application.</p>
        <p>They point out that while the Americans With Disabilities Act requires the removal of barriers to the handicapped, that law directly conflicts with safety regulations at gas stations. So they patented a wireless communication system that a disabled person can use to activate a gas pump.</p>
        <p>The person would carry a transponder containing data about ''the specific gasoline requirements of such individual, including, for example, the type of assistance required by the individual, payment options, fueling limitations, receipt specifications, personal identification codes, an indication that the individual is color blind, and other information normally obtained by customer interaction with fueling dispenser,'' the inventors say.</p>
        <p>The information would be transmitted to a transceiver installed next to a pump. A controlling computer would analyze the information and send instructions to the pump. The transponder could even alert station attendants that the car of a disabled person had arrived so an employee could handle the hose and nozzle if necessary. Mr. McSpadden, Mr. Kaehler and Mr. Dickson were awarded patent 6,087,954.</p>
