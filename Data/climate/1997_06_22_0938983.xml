        <p>Leaders Trying to Redefine Roles in Global Economy  President Clinton and the leaders of Russia, Japan and Western Europe plunged into the messy business of redefining their roles in the global economy, with Russia pressing for quick entry into the World Trade Organization and Europe struggling to save its drive toward a single currency. Mr. Clinton exuded optimism at the summit meeting in Denver, but his aides were skeptical that Russia and Europe were willing to make substantial economic reforms.</p>

        <p>Pol Pot Reported Captured  Appearing together, Cambodia's two Prime Ministers said the Khmer Rouge leader, Pol Pot, had been captured. They said they would ask the United Nations to help put him on trial for the bloodletting that took a million Cambodian lives. The news carried more credibility than murky reports last week.</p>

        <p>China Dissidents Lose Outlet  A modern version of the underground railway, one that has spirited upwards of 500 dissidents out of China, is shutting down with the close of British rule in Hong Kong. The colony had tolerated the escape route.</p>

        <p>Somalia Regroups  Somalians, without a government since 1991, are trying to rebuild their lives. They might succeed if the Red Sea port of Bossaso is a harbinger. Once a sleepy town of 10,000, it now has 80,000 residents, a stable government and a growing economy.</p>

        <p>Leftist Acclaimed in Mexico  Two weeks before Mexico City's first mayoral election in 70 years, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, a leftist candidate, is so far ahead that he is being seen not just like the mayor-elect but like a potential president.</p>

        <p>Major Decisions Came At End of Tobacco Talks  Many contentious issues were settled near the end of the tobacco talks as negotiators struggled to meet a self-imposed deadline for an agreement. The final hours and days involved a frenzy of activity as state officials, public-health advocates, plaintiffs' lawyers and industry representatives raced to resolve issues like punitive damages, payments, protection of whistle-blowers and disclosure of industry documents. The White House apparently played an important role.</p>
        <p>1</p>
        <p>Gore Disappoints Allies  Environmental groups, the core of Vice President Al Gore's political base, have expressed anger and frustration with Mr. Gore on two important issues: toughening air pollution standards and negotiating deep reductions in the emissions of greenhouse gases. The groups are warning Mr. Gore in extraordinarily blunt language that ''green'' voters might abandon him in the Democratic primaries in 2000 unless he comes through now on these issues.</p>

        <p>High Court Rulings Awaited  Nearly all of the Supreme Court's most important cases will be decided in the term's last few days. With its goal of concluding on Thursday, the Court plans to hand down decisions in all 16 of its remaining undecided cases; perhaps 10 cases that could produce landmark decisions.</p>
        <p>15</p>
        <p>Army Hearing Is Postponed  The military's highest court ordered the Army to explain why it had closed to the public a hearing that had been scheduled tomorrow to determine if there is enough evidence to order Gene McKinney, the Sergeant Major of the Army, to be tried on charges of sexual misconduct.</p>

        <p>A Mental Patient's Quest For a Normal Life</p>
        <p>The effort to get a mentally disabled 20-year-old a home of his own is a two-and-a-half-year odyssey through the largely unexplored borderlands of social policy, and a test case of the limits, and the limitations, of one of the great transformations of recent history: the emptying out of public institutions for the developmentally disabled.</p>

        <p>Unseen Voices in Megan Trial  The fight over whether Jesse K. Timmendequas should die for the murder of Megan Kanka was a battle of opposing caricatures drawn by the prosecution and the defense. But in their decision on Friday to impose the death penalty, the jurors rejected both, finding his childhood was not as horrific as the defense said and not as benign as the prosecution said.</p>
