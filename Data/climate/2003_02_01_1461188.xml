        <p>President Bush is cultivating a greener image with prominent mentions of clean air, healthy forests and pollution-free cars in his State of the Union speech.</p>

        <p>President Bush's prominent mentions of clean air, healthy forests and pollution-free cars in his State of the Union speech reflect what Republican strategists say is an effort to repair his image on environmental issues.</p>
        <p>It was no accident, the strategists say, that Mr. Bush made no mention of his more divisive goal to increase drilling in the Alaska wilderness or that his chief political adviser, Karl Rove, told reporters the other day that his boss was following Theodore Roosevelt's tradition of environmentalism.</p>
        <p>With the possibility of war approaching, the strategists say the president needs to shore up his standing with suburban women and other crucial swing voters who say they are fearful about what they see as an imminent war with Iraq. Those constituencies, recent opinion polls show, are more likely than other voters to say they regard environmental protections as crucial work of government.</p>
        <p>A Republican pollster, Neil Newhouse, called Mr. Bush's steps insulation and likened them to the strategy of the president's brother Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida in his re-election campaign last year, when he pushed to restore the Everglades and ban offshore oil drilling, two priorities for Florida voters.</p>
        <p>''It's an aggressive outreach effort to touch people who might not be impressed with this administration,'' Mr. Newhouse said. ''It takes an issue potentially off the table. It's smart policy and it's smart politics.''</p>
        <p>Many of the administration's moves for deregulation have been criticized as anti-environment. That includes when the administration suggested that it would allow more arsenic in drinking water, weakening the antipollution rules for old electric power plants and allowing snowmobiles to continue in Yellowstone National Park.</p>
        <p>Environmental advocates say the president's more recent proposals like the one for hybrid cars are small gestures, not backed up with financing and meant to repair political damage rather than charting a new course.</p>
        <p>John Podesta, President Bill Clinton's chief of staff who is an environmental advocate for the League of Conservation Voters, said of Mr. Bush's renewed attention to environmental issues, ''They clearly think they have a problem.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Podesta added that the president's words on the environment did not match his actions.</p>
        <p>As part of the White House push to seize on issues that will appeal to suburban environment-conscious voters and to counter Democratic attacks, the administration showcased the women who head the three environment-related agencies. The day after the State of the Union speech, Christie Whitman of the Environmental Protection Agency, Ann M. Veneman of the Agriculture Department and Gale A. Norton of the Interior Department all appeared.</p>
        <p>''Despite the fact that often times we get criticized,'' Ms. Veneman said, ''we think that we have a very strong environmental record.''</p>
        <p>The administration, which Democrats say has ignored global warming, recently announced that it would hold an Earth Observation Summit in the summer to improve monitoring of the climate. It also proposed an increase in fuel economy standards for sport utility vehicles and pickups. The proposed increase of one and a half miles a gallon was criticized by opponents as minuscule, but it was the first such proposal in six years.</p>
        <p>James L. Connaughton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said that despite negative reviews by Democrats, the administration was making progress on the environment and would promote its record in the 2004 campaign.</p>
        <p>''We're talking about concrete results that are economically rational,'' Mr. Connaughton said.</p>
        <p>Pointing to programs on wetlands and proposals on clean air, he added, ''The net improvements in terms of environmental outcomes are going to be huge.''</p>
        <p>Democrats are not likely to sit by while Mr. Bush makes a play for the environmental vote, a traditional Democratic constituency.</p>
        <p>Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Connecticut Democrat who is a presidential contender, said Mr. Bush's comments in the State of the Union address were prompted by the realization that ''public disappointment is now turning to anger about his unacceptable environmental record.''</p>
        <p>Another contender, former Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, said that in the Northeast ''it will be impossible for the president to win a single state, because of his undoing of the Clean Air Act.</p>
        <p>''And calling it Clear Skies,'' Dr. Dean said, ''just makes people madder.''</p>
        <p>Polls show that the environment issue repeatedly favors Democrats. It is one of the few issues on which voters say they trust Democrats to do a better job than Republicans.</p>
        <p>But the administration has learned a thing or two in recent years about handling environmental topics. After the outcry over its arsenic policy, when the administration suggested that it would allow more arsenic in drinking water, the administration became more sophisticated in its presentations.</p>
        <p>Its rule, issued on Dec. 23, on rights of way across federal land, is an example. The administration said the measure would simply help straighten out property disputes.</p>
        <p>Yet a statement from Mr. Lieberman said, ''This is the latest unjustifiable move in a seemingly unending campaign by the Bush administration to roll back or undercut our most basic environmental and public-health protections.''</p>
        <p>Such overheated language may be the only way for Democrats to draw attention to such issues. In the early days of the administration, environmental policy was a source of keen embarrassment to Mr. Bush. But since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, it has slid down the scale of importance.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the administration became smarter about its presentation of environmental issues, many of which are quite technical. Some experts said the Democrats went overboard in predicting that the policies would wreak disaster.</p>
        <p>Ben Lieberman, a senior policy expert at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, said: ''There are legitimate environmental concerns, but the public doesn't buy the gloom-and-doom apocalyptic rhetoric from the Democrats. It's a low-priority issue.''</p>
        <p>The most recent Gallup Poll backs that up. It says people rank the environment as the 13th most important issue of 14, ahead of only abortion. Terrorism is first.</p>
