        <p>LEAD: President Bush's much-ballyhooed clean air proposals took a beating in a House committee but he still can push his innovative acid-rain program through Congress - if he throws the full weight of his Administration and his own prestige behind it.</p>
        <p>President Bush's much-ballyhooed clean air proposals took a beating in a House committee but he still can push his innovative acid-rain program through Congress - if he throws the full weight of his Administration and his own prestige behind it.</p>
        <p>If not, his growing reputation for ''waffling'' will be furthered and his early credits as an environmentalist will be lost. Already, Mr. Bush has failed to call the White House environmental conference for this year that he promised in his campaign, and he seems reluctant to join the industrialized world in moving against global warming - perhaps because John Sununu, his chief of staff, is reported to believe the problem does not yet require action.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sununu also was ingloriously involved in one of the Administration's most embarrassing setbacks -when that House committee threw out Mr. Bush's plan requiring the automobile industry to build and sell, in the nation's nine most polluted cities, one million alternative-fuel cars by 1997. It was not just that the committee surrendered to the industry, merely requiring it to certify its capacity to build the cars; Mr. Sununu was reported to have undercut the Bush proposal, while William Reilly, the director of the Environmental Protection Agency, was supporting it.</p>
        <p>That produced charges that the Administration was ''all over the lot'' while George Bush was nowhere. Then the committee gave him the back of its hand again, stiffening far beyond his desires the proposals he had sent up for reducing pol-lutants emitted from automobile tailpipes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's acid-rain plan is still on the table, however, though it faces stiff opposition in both houses. Environmental sources believe it still can be approved, if the President and the Senate majority leader, George Mitchell, join forces in supporting it. Mr. Mitchell has every reason to do so, since his home state, Maine, is a major sufferer from acid rain and he is trying to overcome the Democrats' reputation as big spenders.</p>
        <p>The Bush plan sets a tough and permanent cap on pollutants that cause acid rain, emitted from 107 plants in 18 states. The plan requires a reduction of 10 million tons of sulfur dioxide (about half the total now spewed into the air) and two million tons of oxides of nitrogen over the next 10 years -far greater emission cuts than the affected industries wanted.</p>
        <p>They could achieve specified reductions in pollutants by any of several methods - installing smokestack scrubbers, switching to low-sulfur coal, encouraging consumer conservation of electricity, adopting new technologies, or any combination of the above. The Administration and the Environmental Defense Fund -which helped devise the plan - contend that this would be less costly than requiring the plants to install scrubbers, with Government subsidizing the expense.</p>
        <p>Costs could be further reduced by a daring ''market approach.'' If one plant cut its pollutants more than required, it could sell its overage to another plant that had not sufficiently reduced its emissions. The buying plant then could subtract that amount of pollutants from the reductions it otherwise would have to achieve. The costs to both would be lowered - to the selling plant by the proceeds of the sale, to the buyer in the reduced costs of reaching a smaller quota.</p>
        <p>That is not ''selling pollution rights,'' as some critics have called it, since the total required reduction of sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen still would have to be achieved. Nor is the whole program ''anti-growth,'' as critics also allege. To reduce the emission of pollutants is not necessarily to restrain the capacity for economic growth or plant expansion. When the benefits of an end to acid rain - which kills lakes, rivers, animal and plant life, and even damages structures - are included, the cost-benefit ratio heavily supports Mr. Bush's program.</p>
        <p>But will Congress support it? That may depend on the Senate, where action on acid rain is expected first and might well influence the House. The former majority leader, Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, a high-sulfur-coal state, leads the formidable opposition of other such states and of the Midwestern utilities most affected.</p>
        <p>That only gives George Bush the opportunity to prove two things now in doubt: his commitment to environmentalism and his resolution as a political leader.</p>
