      <abstract>
        <p>New FAA rule sets ceiling of 0.5 percent carbon dioxide in airplane cabins, compared with old ceiling of 3 percent and level of 0.03 percent that FAA says is found in outdoor air (S)</p>

        <p>Although the Department of Transportation has issued a new regulation on the quality of air in plane cabins, it will not help travelers who blame airline trips for their upper respiratory infections. The new rule reduces the level of carbon dioxide -- the stuff humans breathe out -- permitted in the cabins of new planes while in flight. The old rule allows a maximum of 3 percent carbon dioxide in cabins; the new rule, which took effect Jan. 2 for planes going into service from that date, sets a ceiling of 0.5 percent. This compares with a level of 0.03 that the Federal Aviation Administration said is found in outdoor air. But most planes, the agency said, already meet the new rule.</p>
        <p>The rule change arose from a study of air quality requested by Congress and conducted by the National Academy of Sciences.</p>
        <p>When the level of carbon dioxide in a space increases, people breathe faster and more deeply. The study found that at 3 percent carbon dioxide, there is some discomfort; beyond that, passengers may experience headache, malaise and fatigue.</p>

        <p>A lot of passenger discomfort arises from the desertlike dryness aloft. Cabin air dries out mucous membranes and may be a factor in the infections travelers pick up. Drinking plenty of water and using skin moisturizers may help.</p>
