        <p>LEAD: Incidenls like a mock slave auction at the University of Wisconsin at Madison and the broadcast of racial slurs on a University of Michigan radio station have made race relations a top issue on college campuses nationwide, interviews with about 300 students at 20 universities show.</p>
        <p>Incidenls like a mock slave auction at the University of Wisconsin at Madison and the broadcast of racial slurs on a University of Michigan radio station have made race relations a top issue on college campuses nationwide, interviews with about 300 students at 20 universities show.</p>
        <p>Other issues listed by the students interviewed were the state of the environment, abortion rights, drug and alcohol abuse, high tuition and crime.</p>
        <p>Poor race relations on campus were by far the most frequently mentioned concern of students interviewed.</p>
        <p>''Racism is a primary issue at such a large school as this,'' said Bill Sheridan, editor of The Spectrum, the student-run daily at the State University of New York at Buffalo, ''because we have a diverse population and many different races on campus.'' Too Few Minority Students</p>
        <p>Too few minority professors and students, and tuition increases that drive away minority pupils contribute to racial tensions, some students said. ''The system here is structured to cater to white students,'' said Felicia Clark, a senior in political science and a member of the Black Student Alliance at the University of Colorado at Boulder. ''The price of the school attracts white people who have probably never been around blacks and who believe all the stereotypes about them.''</p>
        <p>Quelling racial unrest will be a priority at many schools this fall, interviews with the students showed. ''There have been so many campuses where these unfortunate incidents have taken place,'' said John W. Chandler, president of the Association of American Colleges, ''that there is a determination among students and college administrators to address the issue.''</p>
        <p>In October 1988, members of the Theta Beta Tau fraternity at the University of Wisconsin at Madison conducted a mock slave auction and performed skits in black face and imitated black performers. At the University of Michigan in 1987, racial jokes were broadcast on the student radio station.</p>
        <p>Last June, the University of Wisconsin at Madison prohibited offensive and discriminatory speech or conduct. ''This was a necessity on our campus,'' said Michele Goodwin, a member of the school's Black Student Union, who fought for the rule. ''It says 'Let's cut this out.' You must respect the rights of those who go to school with you.'' Covertly Racist</p>
        <p>Wellesley College is covertly racist, says a report released by the college's Task Force on Racism, which includes faculty, staff, administration and students. Although overt acts of racism are rare, the committee concluded, subtle forms exist that people may not recognize as such.</p>
        <p>The report says that to solve this problem, Wellesley must increase the number of minorities on campus. It makes 19 recommendations for achieving this goal, among them, that each academic department, within its next three hires, choose one minority candidate.</p>
        <p>Another issue on campus is high tuition. ''Raising tuition is discriminating against people who can't afford it, especially at a state school like this,'' said Leslie Zucker, a senior at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.</p>
        <p>Drug and alcohol abuse are constant concerns. Many national fraternities have responded by banning alcohol from rush. ''There are a lot of immature people in college who try to make it seem like taking drugs and getting drunk is standard,'' said Doug Weaver, a sophomore majoring in electrical engineering at Ohio State University. Crime on Campus</p>
        <p>Campus safety and crime is on the minds of many students, even though crime at many universities is just a fraction of the crime in areas fringing the universities.</p>
        <p>''Typically the area surrounding this campus has about 50 rapes for every one we have and for every one of our auto thefts the surrounding area has about 70 or 80,'' said Capt. John R. Hartsock of the Ohio State police.</p>
        <p>Bicycle thefts remain an irritant on virtually all campuses surveyed. ''They don't take the junkers either,'' said Sgt. John Kish of the campus police force at the University of Colorado, where the value of bicycles stolen was $60,000 in 1988. ''They know exeactly what they're looking for.''</p>
        <p>The AIDS epidemic has made students more careful about sex, prompting the installation of condom machines and the distribution of brochures and posters on safe sex. Playing It Safe</p>
        <p>''People are being safer now in general,'' said Jeff L. Stricker, a sophomore at Ohio State. ''But you still know people who AIDS hasn't affected that much. They still sleep around.''</p>
        <p>Abortion rights have become a pivotal issue on many college campuses. The leaders of anti-abortion and abortion-rights groups at most campuses surveyed reported large increases in membership.</p>
        <p>Then there is the issue of parking spaces, or rather, the lack of them. ''If I have to choose between missing a class and paying $60 to $100 in towing fees I'll miss class,'' said Richard Kilstein, a first-year law student at the University of Miami.</p>
        <p>Environmental issues like the greenhouse effect, deforestation and the Exxon oil spill in Alaska are prompting much talk, but little action on campuses, the interviews with students show. ''People care about the environment, but not enough to turn off their air-conditioning units,'' said Jose Carillo, a senior majoring in public policy at Duke. Students Care Less</p>
        <p>At the University of California at Los Angeles, a student proposal to set up bins for recycling newspapers, cans and bottles failed because campus officials believed they would be too costly, unsightly and unpopular.</p>
        <p>Charles Schroeder, vice president of student development at St. Louis University, who has studied student populations for almost 25 years, said today's students are less interested in social issues than they were two decades ago. During the 1960's, freshmen surveys conducted by the Higher Education Research Institute at UCLA found that 80 percent of the students questioned believed that ''developing a philosophy of life'' and doing some social good was most important. Today, 30 percent believe that, he said.</p>
        <p>''Students are worried mostly about getting a job after school,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Marshall Smart, a first-year graduate student in chemistry at California State University at Los Angeles, said: ''Students tend to have a lack of awareness outside their own interests.'' He said he didn't know whether ''that's due to a failure to inform themselves or their lack of interest in what's going on.''</p>
        <p>Darla Short, an Ohio State senior majoring in social work, said: ''The bottom line is that students on this campus are pretty self-centered. They worry about their date on Friday night more than broad issues. If they are upset about something they complain but they don't usually act.''</p>
