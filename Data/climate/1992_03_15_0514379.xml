        <p>HANG on, all you flu-ridden and daylight-deprived. Baseball is coming. I know it is, because I have seen it with my own eyes, at spring training in Florida. Soon baseball will be in New York City just about every day from April into October, making everything all right.</p>
        <p>The nice thing about baseball is that it shares its grace with the uninitiated. Just the sound of a baseball game from a passing car radio makes a person relax, like the first warm breeze of the season.</p>

        <p>HANG on, all you flu-ridden and daylight-deprived. Baseball is coming. I know it is, because I have seen it with my own eyes, at spring training in Florida. Soon baseball will be in New York City just about every day from April into October, making everything all right.</p>
        <p>The nice thing about baseball is that it shares its grace with the uninitiated. Just the sound of a baseball game from a passing car radio makes a person relax, like the first warm breeze of the season.</p>
        <p>For the fan, baseball is positively a lifesaver. I recently talked to Jeff Torborg, the new manager of the Mets, and Bobby Bonilla, the Mets' new $6.1 million outfielder, and Nick Zito, the noted horse trainer, and they all raved about the hold baseball had on their respective childhoods around New York.</p>
        <p>As I talked to them, I remembered how baseball once saved my life, when I was around 10 years old, back when we used to have huge snowfalls in New York all winter, before global warming.</p>
        <p>It was a Saturday afternoon in mid-March, and for some reason I had been listening to a Yankees radio broadcast from spring training. I say "for some reason" because we were Dodgers fans. Back in those days, there were three teams in New York, and people actually argued over the differences.</p>
        <p>Anyway, I can remember hearing Mel Allen call the game from the Yankees' camp in St. Petersburg on the west coast of Florida. Allen was so morbidly fearful the Yankees might not win every single game on their schedule that he did not have time to paint word pictures of the scene before him.</p>
        <p>But somehow his Alabama drawl and his recitation of names like DiMaggio and Henrich made me see rickety Al Lang Stadium and the palm trees and the players once again sliding around in good honest dirt.</p>
        <p>Those visions stayed with me later that day when I was sent to the store during a veritable blizzard. It was dark and cold and the snow was piling over the roofs of the cars, or at least that's how I remember it. As I lugged the milk and bread homeward, I feared I might vanish in the snowdrifts.</p>
        <p>Conjuring up the booming echoes of Mel Allen and the images of noble Rizzuto and noble Berra, I trudged onward through the steppes of Queens County. Ever since that day, I firmly believe in baseball as an emotional St. Bernard, patrolling the treacherous mountain passes of our lives.</p>
        <p>Even though its leaders defy nature by putting in artificial turf and domed stadiums, and the pay can only be called unbelievable, baseball is the only sport in harmony with nature. It is real life. Everything else is the off-season.  A Daily Ritual</p>
        <p>The two New York teams are currently playing exhibitions in Florida, but starting in April there will be 81 home games at both Yankee Stadium and Shea Stadium, and an equal number of road games, just about all on the radio and most of them on television, for those fortunate enough to have cable.</p>
        <p>Because it is played every day, baseball becomes a familiar ritual, bringing parents and children into the same room, onto the same sofa, for an hour or more of group dynamics, in the glorious time after homework and before bedtime. How bad can that be?</p>
        <p>For the fans who follow the games daily on the tube, baseball may not seem as funny as a sitcom or as gripping as a movie, but baseball is cheap and available and resilient.</p>
        <p>You can shout at the screen ("Give it a rest, Tim!") or flick off the switch and go do something constructive ("When are the Yankees gonna get a pitching staff!"), but the next day, baseball bounces back, like the lovable Al Capp character that existed to be kicked around. 'I Can't Imagine a Better Thing'</p>
        <p>At the age of 50, Jeff Torborg grows sentimental remembering how he and his father, Bob, would settle in for the Giants' pre-game show on Channel 11, with Leo Durocher and his wife, the actress Laraine Day.</p>
        <p>"I can't imagine a better thing for a kid," Torborg said. "My father would come home with some hand-packed ice cream and a can of peanuts and we'd sit together and watch the game."</p>
        <p>"We didn't go to the city that much because we lived in New Jersey, and I played sports, of course," Torborg added. "But the last year the Giants were in New York, 1957, he made a point of taking me to the Polo Grounds late in the season. I remember Bob Rush with the Cubs pitching 16 or 18 innings all by himself."</p>
        <p>With either the Mets or Yankees home nearly every day, fans learn to pick their spots.</p>
        <p>"You've got so many sports in New York," said Bonilla, who grew up in the South Bronx and was a Yankee fan. "You've got the Jets and Giants, three hockey teams, the Knicks and Nets, and the St. John's Redmen in basketball. But baseball is No. 1."</p>
        <p>"Finances being what they were, you couldn't go all the time," Bonilla recalled. "But you'd go on bat day or cap day, and you'd follow your team every day." First Visit to the Stadium</p>
        <p>New York fans talk in hushed voices about their first game. Nick Zito, the trainer who won the Kentucky Derby last year with Strike the Gold, recently visited the Yankees' camp, as excited as the children leaning over the fence. Zito recalled his mother, Carmela, taking him to Yankee Stadium, probably when he was 9.</p>
        <p>"We took the A train all the way through Brooklyn and Manhattan and then we changed. I remember walking into the Stadium, thinking, 'Wow.' I remember Gene Woodling hitting a home run for Cleveland to beat the Yankees."</p>
        <p>Zito's professional eye watched the pitchers practice covering first base, over and over again. Soon they would be called upon to deliver that burst of speed in a real game. Baseball was getting ready to head north. For all of us. Where the Hits Will Be</p>
