        <p>LEAD: At least two people were killed and seven injured when a carbon dioxide tank exploded today at a plant that makes airplane and rocket parts.</p>
        <p>At least two people were killed and seven injured when a carbon dioxide tank exploded today at a plant that makes airplane and rocket parts.</p>
        <p>The blast at Reinhold Industries, a division of the Bairnco Corporation, occurred about 2:30 p.m., as employees were installing a high-pressure molding machine, said Fire Marshal Stan Boettcher. Several carbon dioxide cylinders were beside the building, and one or more may have been hooked up to the machine, he said.</p>
        <p>Two men were killed by the explosion, and seven were injured, said Sgt. Thomas Heller of the Sheriff's Department. Two of the injured were in serious condition, he said.</p>
        <p>The explosion of the tank, which holds gas under high pressure, did not cause a fire or chemical leak, Mr. Boettcher said.</p>
        <p>The blast sent pieces of machinery through the metal roof, and caused telephone and electrical failures in the area 15 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles.</p>
