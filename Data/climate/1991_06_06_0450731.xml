        <p>Antarctica: remote, forbidding, unspoiled and, except for some scientists, tourists and fishermen, uninhabited. Environmentalists would like to keep it that way -- forever. Others, tempted by the possibility of oil and mineral deposits, are loath to rule one-tenth of the earth's surface off limits to commercial exploitation.</p>
        <p>Two months ago in Madrid, the 26 voting members of the 30-year-old Antarctic Treaty, including the U.S., tentatively settled on a compromise. It would prohibit mining for 50 years, after which the ban could be lifted only if all present members of the treaty concurred.</p>
        <p>There is one big threat to final agreement -- the U.S. Government; forces inside the State and Interior departments oppose final ratification. They believe that the 50-year ban is too long and the requirements for lifting it too severe.</p>
        <p>That position is risky, ecologically and politically. Viewed from afar, Antarctica seems a self-contained ecosystem, so distant from the industrialized world as to be irrelevant. Yet trifling with Antarctica's fragile environment could have profound global consequences.</p>
        <p>The frigid waters of the Southern Ocean, for example, absorb carbon dioxide far more efficiently than warm waters elsewhere. Carbon dioxide is the main contributor to the so-called greenhouse effect -- the feared warming of the earth's atmosphere. Any warming of the ice cap and the adjacent waters by industrial activity would decrease the ocean's ability to act as a "sink" for carbon dioxide. A related danger is that oil spills and pollution would kill the photoplankton that play a major role in converting carbon dioxide into oxygen.</p>
        <p>Antarctica's marine system is also unusually rich in nutrients. Because the Southern Ocean is a force in establishing global tides and currents, these nutrients supply much of the food chain. Scientists concede that some of their fears are speculative. But that is reason enough to provide far more time to assess the consequences of commerce.</p>
        <p>In two separate measures last year, the House and Senate directed the Administration to work toward an "indefinite" ban on commercial activity in Antarctica. President Bush signed the measures and vowed to take a "leadership" role. For the Administration to reverse itself now would infuriate Congress, damage Mr. Bush's credibility and anger allies -- who set aside their own commercial ambitions in favor of the 50-year ban.</p>
        <p>Multinational oil and mineral companies have shown little interest in Antarctica's inhospitable terrain. Perhaps in 50 years they will. And perhaps by then ways will have been found to minimize the impact of ports, towns, storage facilities, waste disposal sites, roads, airstrips and pipelines. But even in that unlikely event, the decision to invade Antarctica ought never to be made lightly or quickly.</p>
