      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial, noting New York State's legislative session is winding down, calls on lawmakers to address issues of campaign finance reform, violent and sexually explicit video games, healthy school meals, Wicks Law that requires local governments to solicit bids for separate parts of building contracts, use of cameras in courtrooms, phantom authorities system, siting and construction of power plants and sanitation and congestion-pricing plans for New York City</p>

        <p>About this time every year, the New York Legislature starts to kick into high gear. These are the last few days of the year's official session, and often that deadline is enough to make Albany's regulars summon the final oomph needed to finish six months of business in two short weeks.</p>
        <p>Here are some of the issues that should be untangled before legislators pack up for the year:</p>
        <p>Campaign finance reform is still the biggest goal on this year's list. All parties seem too close to an agreement to let another year go by without improving one of the worst campaign financing systems in the country. And Gov. Eliot Spitzer has said that without campaign finance reform, he will not sanction pay raises for members of the Legislature.</p>

        <p>About this time every year, the New York Legislature starts to kick into high gear. These are the last few days of the year's official session, and often that deadline is enough to make Albany's regulars summon the final oomph needed to finish six months of business in two short weeks.</p>
        <p>Here are some of the issues that should be untangled before legislators pack up for the year:</p>
        <p>Campaign finance reform is still the biggest goal on this year's list. All parties seem too close to an agreement to let another year go by without improving one of the worst campaign financing systems in the country. And Gov. Eliot Spitzer has said that without campaign finance reform, he will not sanction pay raises for members of the Legislature.</p>
        <p>The real victims here are the judges. Legislators refuse to give judges a raise unless they get one. (How is that for taking hostages?) Instead, if lawmakers cannot even agree on modest campaign finance reforms, they should at least make certain that the judges get a pay raise immediately. The judiciary is growing angrier by the day, with rumblings that the judges might strike or sue the state. If Albany lets it come to that, the chaos will land on every legislator's doorstep.</p>
        <p>Congestion pricing is among Mayor Michael Bloomberg's more adventurous ideas for making New York a liveable city for years to come. On Thursday, Mr. Spitzer strongly endorsed the idea even as Washington announced that the city was one of nine finalists for a share of $1.1 billion in federal funds that could be used for the project. But this money could disappear unless the state legislature approves the Mayor's plan by August, which it absolutely must do.</p>
        <p>Violent and sexually explicit video games can be repulsive and demeaning. But banning them as Mr. Spitzer and legislators want to do probably will not pass muster in the courts. Also, the defense of such laws can be expensive -- Illinois paid out more than $1,500,000 in taxpayer funds when courts found that its effort to ban violent videos was unconstitutional.</p>
        <p>A plan to promote healthier school meals should work if it can help youngsters avoid fat, sugar and salt. That means keeping students away from the calories that come in sodas or even sports drinks, requiring low-fat or nonfat milk, and making sure Ã  la carte items like pizzas are not substitutes for a balanced lunch.</p>
        <p>The 1921 Wicks Law -- which requires local governments to solicit bids for the separate parts of a building contract, instead of hiring one general contractor -- has slowed progress in public building for over eight decades. It is time to get rid of this boondoggle, which does only one thing -- costs the taxpayers more money.</p>
        <p>The Assembly has been sitting on a bill to open courtrooms to cameras. One wonders: why this allergy to daylight?</p>
        <p>Reform of the phantom authorities system is so basic and so necessary that it should be done right away. That means giving some independent oversight, allowing the comptroller to vet contracts and making directors promise to do their duties to uphold the public mission of their authorities.</p>
        <p>The state needs a new law governing the siting and construction of power plants. There are many competing interests here -- renewable energy interests, coal interests, nuclear interests. And all want their favorite energy sources ''fast-tracked.''</p>
        <p>The Senate bill assumes, mistakenly, that all power is good power; the Assembly version and Mr. Spitzer's lean towards cleaner power, which makes sense at a time when every effort must be made to minimize greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>Besides congestion pricing, the Legislature should grant Mayor Bloomberg one more wish by approving his sanitation plan, even though a few key legislators in Manhattan are battling it. The idea was for each borough to deal with its share of trash. That has to include Manhattan.</p>
        <p>And, did we mention campaign finance reform?</p>
