        <p>Old air-conditioners, still containing Freon, are being dumped illegally in Park Slope section of Brooklyn, possibly by work crews renovating buildings; photo (M)</p>

        <p>Just west of Sixth Avenue on Garfield Place in Park Slope, Brooklyn, sat a rusted hunk of metal, wire and insulation that used to be an air-conditioner. It stood behind a metal fence where people keep their garbage, and its years as a cooling device seemed far behind it.</p>
        <p>''It's not from this building,'' said Maria Franca, a neighbor who was walking her dog down Garfield on a sunny Thursday afternoon. ''We got up one morning, and it was just sitting there.''</p>

        <p>Just west of Sixth Avenue on Garfield Place in Park Slope, Brooklyn, sat a rusted hunk of metal, wire and insulation that used to be an air-conditioner. It stood behind a metal fence where people keep their garbage, and its years as a cooling device seemed far behind it.</p>
        <p>''It's not from this building,'' said Maria Franca, a neighbor who was walking her dog down Garfield on a sunny Thursday afternoon. ''We got up one morning, and it was just sitting there.''</p>
        <p>The appliance was one of several that have been dumped on corners around the neighborhood. Half a block down sat a white Panasonic, without knobs, that Ms. Franca said had been there a week. Nobody knows where the units come from, but Ms. Franca's theory is that they are left by work crews renovating buildings farther down the Slope near Fourth Avenue.</p>
        <p>If that is the case, someone isn't following procedure. Air-conditioners contain the coolant Freon, which is harmful to the ozone layer, and people throwing them away are supposed to call the city's 311 line to arrange for special disposal. Once the Freon has been removed, crews affix an orange sticker marking the unit safe for garbage trucks to pick up.</p>
        <p>Ominously, neither of the appliances on Garfield had a sticker.</p>
        <p>''If it's outside of a residence, someone is going to get a fine,'' said Taryn Duckett, a Sanitation Department spokeswoman. ''Even though it's illegal dumping, whoever is complaining about it, notices it, whatever, they should still call 311 to pick it up.''</p>
        <p>What if no one calls?</p>
        <p>''There really aren't going to be any cases where something would just sit,'' Ms. Duckett said, ''because our supervisors go on patrol, and if they see something sitting there for X amount of time, it would be removed.''</p>
        <p>This day, three notable exceptions sat a few blocks away from Garfield, at Sixth Avenue and Fourth Street. A Fedders unit and two companion appliances rested in a neat row, their shells peeled back and their copper piping carefully snipped out. Flakes of rust surrounded them on the sidewalk.</p>
        <p>They had been there about three weeks, said Julia Waldron, who lives in a building on the corner. As it happened, Ms. Waldron had thrown out an air-conditioner of her own days earlier, but had gone through the proper channels, calling 311.</p>
        <p>''They came and got it, so I don't know why these other ones are still here,'' she mused. ''Unless the people didn't call.''</p>
