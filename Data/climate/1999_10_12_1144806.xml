        <p>BY the reckoning of no less than the United Nations, the world's population hits the six billion mark today.</p>
        <p>With all respect to international experts in such matters, that figure cannot be right. There must be many more people than that on the planet because most days there are at least six billion people traipsing through mid-Manhattan alone.</p>
        <p>That's what it feels like, anyway, much of the time; six billion people pushing and shoving their way past endless construction sites, looking faintly unhinged as they claw their way to an appointment or a lunch or a matinee. Times Square, ground zero for much of the frenzy, can make a Nine Inch Nails concert seem uncrowded and serene. The streets there, stripped to the roadbed, bring back visions of the Ho Chi Minh Trail after a B-52 strike.</p>
        <p>You may think that a patriotic New Yorker should feel thrilled with all the construction because it is a sign of boom times and of a resurgent city, bigger and better than ever.</p>
        <p>Bigger, for sure. But even someone who bleeds New York blue, white and orange has to wonder if all sense of proportion has been lost. One 40-story tower is good for a neighborhood? Well, then, several 40-story towers must be several times better. That seems to be the prevailing logic among city planners, who, if they were bakers, would probably decorate a wedding cake with dozens of little brides and grooms. More is better, no?</p>
        <p>But there are encouraging signals that City Hall has begun to get a grip. The indications include plans to change the zoning laws so that, at last, height limits are put on new skyscrapers.</p>
        <p>Had such restrictions been in place a few years ago, for example, the latest monument to Donald J. Trump's ego could not have legally been built. That's Trump World Tower, a 72-story apartment building rising on First Avenue in the 40's, a corner of the city whose populace is divided into two principal categories: the haves and the have-mores. Mr. Trump hopes to lure a third group, the have-mosts, to his building, where condominiums up in the ozone layer leave million-dollar price tags far behind.</p>
        <p>To really restore rational planning to New York civic life, an even more effective tactic than zoning laws might be to elect Mr. Trump President next year. Once he moves into the White House with the First Babe, whoever she may be, he will presumably be too busy setting the world right to tart up Manhattan with any more marble and glass odes to himself.</p>
        <p>Go ahead, laugh. But Mr. Trump insists he can win, and a National Enquirer poll backs him up. You need better proof than that?</p>
        <p>O.K., he has image problems, including the fact that he looks a little like someone who shares a barber with Slobodan Milosevic. But that shouldn't hurt him much if he runs for the Reform Party nomination against the likes of Patrick J. Buchanan, whom Mr. Trump portrays as out of goose step with mainstream America.</p>
        <p>IT may not even be necessary to wait for Mr. Trump's election for New Yorkers to feel the benefits. That could happen once he formally declares his candidacy.</p>
        <p>Given the near-impossibility of turning a corner here without seeing the name Trump plastered on one tower or another, the City Council would have reason to deem this an unfair campaign advantage and order the immediate de-Trumping of buildings. Taking down his name could be rationalized as a blow not only for political equity, but also for good taste.</p>
        <p>Of course, to avoid possible charges of bias in the race for United States senator next year, Council members might also have to redesignate the several Clinton Streets and Clinton Avenues. But that should present no hardship. Naming streets is one thing the Council does very well.</p>
        <p>Then, with Mr. Trump out of the picture, New Yorkers can focus on truly urgent development issues likely to emerge in the 21st century. There are too many to go into, but here's one:</p>
        <p>The United Nations -- let's assume it is right with that six billion figure -- projects that by 2050, a quarter of the developed world will be over 65. Think what that will mean for a city like New York, whose economy depends heavily on its thousands of restaurants.</p>
        <p>How many early-bird specials do you think those places can offer and still stay in business? Yet, with the clock ticking, not a single politician is talking about this issue. Where is leadership when you need it?</p>
