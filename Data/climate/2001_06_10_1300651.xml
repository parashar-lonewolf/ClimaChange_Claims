        <p>Last week, Condoleezza Rice, President Bush's national security adviser, defended the administration's reexamination of evidence of global warming, challenging critics to find another instance when most of a cabinet sat ''week after week after week'' through briefings by scientists on such a complicated topic.</p>
        <p>Indeed, some of the sessions -- aside from the security scans by the Secret Service and bomb-sniffing dogs -- have borne quite a resemblance to a college course in climatology. In one recent ''class'' for Vice President Dick Cheney and half a dozen cabinet secretaries at Commerce Department headquarters, Dr. Daniel L. Albritton, the director of the department's Aeronomy Laboratory in Boulder, Col., eschewed the ubiquitous PowerPoint presentation and instead used hand-drawn transparencies and an overhead projector to lay out the basics. The transparencies can be seen in their entirety online at www.oar.noaa.gov/education/.</p>

        <p>Although Dr. Albritton has spent his 34-year career as a government scientist, not a teacher, he came across like a seasoned professor, people who attended the briefing said.</p>
        <p>In crisp, quick sentences, he described the links -- some clear, some not -- between human affairs and the planet's thermostat. Dr. Albritton said he likes to draw his own slides as a way to crystallize his thoughts on an issue. ''It's like a mini-rehearsal,'' he said in an interview.
