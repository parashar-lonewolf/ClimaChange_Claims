        <p>A speeding object from outer space that struck the Earth 65 million years ago in a cataclysm that may have wiped out the dinosaurs was far larger than previously thought and produced what was perhaps the largest explosion to rock the planet since life began, a new study says.</p>
        <p>The crater left by the object's impact lies beneath the Gulf of Mexico and the northern tip of the Yucatan Peninsula. Geological processes like erosion and sedimentation have long since buried all visible signs of the vast scar, which lies a mile or so beneath the Earth's surface. That makes it hard to pin down its dimensions and cause, whether an asteroid or comet.</p>
        <p>The crater's existence has been known for several years, along with the date of its formation at the end of the Cretaceous period. That made it the leading candidate for the impact that some scientists argue ended the reign of the dinosaurs. But the explosion that would have caused such a crater seemed only barely large enough to wreak global havoc, and scientists have been searching for companion craters that might have accounted for the catastrophe.</p>
        <p>They need search no more.</p>
        <p>The new study, published in today's issue of the journal Science, increases the estimated diameter of the crater from 110 miles to 185 miles, based on a new map of variations in the area's gravitational field. The speeding object itself is now calculated to have been 5 to 10 miles across.</p>
        <p>The colossal energy released in its collision with the Earth is now estimated to be equal to the detonation of up to 300 million hydrogen bombs, each some 70 times bigger than the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.</p>
        <p>"It's hard to conceive all that energy being released, vaporizing thousands of cubic miles of Earth," the study's lead author, Dr. Virgil L. Sharpton of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, said in a telephone interview. "Clearly, this type of event is extremely rare, something on the order of once every billion years or so."</p>
        <p>Such a colossus would slice through the Earth's atmosphere and ocean, and collide with bedrock at enormous speeds, vaporizing material in a vast explosion and lofting huge amounts of rock and dust high into the stratosphere and beyond.</p>
        <p>The new study adds support to the idea that a doomsday rock from outer space brought an end to the dinosaurs and other creatures at the end of the Cretaceous period by creating a global pall of dust that blotted out the sun, as well as environmental disasters like fire storms and acid rain. That hypothesis, first proposed in 1980, has been questioned by skeptics even while gaining credibility in recent years. The new study is unlikely to end the debate.</p>
        <p>Still, by going from 110 miles to 185 miles, the Yucatan crater now becomes far and away the largest known celestial blemish to mar the Earth's surface. The two closest rivals are in Sudbury, Ontario, and Vredefort, South Africa, where eroded craters were originally thought to be some 90 miles in diameter but lately are thought to be perhaps 125 miles across. Larger Craters in Solar System</p>
        <p>The age of the Yucatan crater, previously dated at 64.98 million years, makes it exactly contemporaneous with the demise of the dinosaurs.</p>
        <p>Dr. Clark R. Chapman, a senior scientist at the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Ariz., who had no involvement in the new study, said the latest estimate of the Mexican crater's size makes it larger than any known to have formed in the past few billion years on the Earth, Moon, Mars, Venus or Mercury. "The implication," Dr. Chapman said, "is that this is the biggest thing that happened anywhere in the inner solar system since life began" in earnest a billion years ago.</p>
        <p>The closest rival is the Mead crater on Venus, named after Margaret Mead, the American anthropologist who died in 1978. The Mead crater is about 175 miles across.</p>
        <p>Larger craters exist in the inner solar system, including such well-known features as the mares, or seas, that form the man in the Moon's face. But these were formed during the early days of the solar system by speeding swarms of planetoids and their smaller cousins, asteroids. That heavy bombardment ended 3.8 billion years ago, after which life slowly began to make its appearance on Earth. Complex life forms first emerged about 600 million years ago during the Cambrian explosion.</p>
        <p>In addition to Dr. Sharpton, the new study was carried out by D. Scott Lee and Paul D. Spudis of the Lunar and Planetary Institute; Kevin Burke and Stuart A. Hall of the University of Houston; Antonio Camargo-Zanoguera and Juan Manuel Quezada-Muneton of Petroleos Mexicanos in Mexico City, and Luis E. Marin, Gerardo Suarez-Reynoso and Jaime Urrutia-Fucugauchi of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico in Mexico City.</p>
        <p>The team, Dr. Sharpton said, analyzed nearly 7,000 readings of gravitational strength that had been made over the suspect region by such groups as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Pentagon's Defense Mapping Agency and Petroleos Mexicanos. The violent impact of the cosmic object 65 million years ago churned up the deep Earth, creating new patterns of low- and high-density rock that in turn can be detected as local changes in the Earth's gravitational field. Bull's-Eye Pattern</p>
        <p>The scientists say they detected three major rings and parts of a fourth expanding in ever-increasing circles, not unlike the pattern of a bull's-eye. The spacing between the rings, they added, is similar to that found on big craters on other planets.</p>
        <p>"Earth," the authors conclude, "probably has not experienced another impact of this magnitude since the development of multi-cellular life approximately a billion years ago."</p>
        <p>They added that an event of such power would have produced environmental havoc and that its occurrence exactly at the end of the reign of the dinosaurs "argues strongly that the effects of this meteorite impact led to the concurrent mass extinction."</p>
