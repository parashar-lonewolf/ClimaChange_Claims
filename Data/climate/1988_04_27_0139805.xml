        <p>LEAD: On the eve of a visit by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, the Administration has rejected a proposal that the United States limit the flow of nitrogen oxide pollution across the border to Canada, Administration officials said today.</p>
        <p>On the eve of a visit by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, the Administration has rejected a proposal that the United States limit the flow of nitrogen oxide pollution across the border to Canada, Administration officials said today.</p>
        <p>Nitrogen oxide contributes to the formation of acid rain, an issue that is high on Canada's agenda in the talks between Mr. Mulroney and President Reagan.</p>
        <p>Acid rain crossing the border from this country into Canada has become a sore point between the two countries. During a visit to Ottawa last year, Mr. Reagan promised to consider action to limit acid rain, but Canadians, environmentalists in this country and others have asserted that he has failed to carry through with concrete actions. Administration officials counter that the problem has been considered and that the President did not pledge that he would act to reduce pollution. Position of Administration</p>
        <p>At negotiations on a protocol on nitrogen oxide pollution held in Geneva earlier this month, Canada proposed a clause that would limit the amount of such pollution permitted to cross its border from the United States.</p>
        <p>The United States contends that it has already taken steps that put it ahead of the rest of the world in reducing nitrogen oxide pollution from motor vehicles and other sources. Therefore, the Reagan Administration argues, the United States should not be required to restrain such pollution until the other industrial countries catch up.</p>
        <p>The negotiations are being conducted through the Economic Commission for Europe, a United Nations group consisting of the industrial nations of Europe, the United States and Canada. The protocol is intended to carry out a convention to reduce transboundary air pollution. An earlier protocol committed those who signed it to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions, another major component of acid rain, by 30 percent. The United States, on the ground that it had already made significant reductions in sulfur dioxide, has not signed that protocol. A Look for Flexibility</p>
        <p>At the negotiations on nitrogen oxides, the United States had proposed a clause giving itself a ''credit'' for the reductions it had already achieved, thus allowing it to increase its emissions of these pollutants.</p>
        <p>But Deputy Assistant Secretary of State William Nitze, chief American negotiator at the Geneva talks, said today that earlier this month, he told the Canadians he would try to find out if there was enough ''flexibility'' to make some accommodation to Canada.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nitze and other United States officials emphasized, however, that no commitment was made or agreement reached with the Canadians. Now, as the United States delegation is returning to Geneva, the Administration has decided that it cannot accept the Canadian proposal.</p>
        <p>He said one of the problems was differences between the United States and Canada over how nitrogen oxide pollution is measured. Appeal From New York</p>
        <p>Sheldon Meyers, acting associate administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for international activities and a member of the delegation, said that when the Americcan negotiators talked to the Canadian representatives in Geneva earlier this month ''we just wanted to hear what they wanted.''</p>
        <p>An official at the Canadian Embassy here said that there had been no agreement between the United States on a clause to limit nitrogen oxides moving across the border. What there had been, he said was an informal understanding between members of the two delegations that such a proposal would be reviewed.</p>
        <p>In one activity not directly related to the Mulroney meeting, lawyers for eight northeastern states, including Attorney General Robert Abrams of New York, argued in the United States Court of Appeals here today that the environmental agency should be ordered to reverse its decision not to order a reduction of sulfur dioxide emissions from Midwestern sources.</p>
        <p>At another news conference today David Scanlan, president of the International Maple Syrup Institute, a trade association of United States and Canadian producers, said that maple syrup production had declined by nearly 45 percent since 1981 and that ''acid rain is the prime suspect.''</p>
        <p>On Wednesday the Public Interest Research Group, a nonprofit research and advocacy group, joined by other environmental and citizen organizations, will stage a demonstration in front of the White House, with pictures of dead fish and smokestacks, to protest what they say is President Reagan's inaction on acid rain.</p>
        <p>Finally, 19 Senators, Republicans and Democrats, sent a letter to President Reagan today urging him to reach an agreement with Prime Minister Mulroney to reduce acid rain.</p>
