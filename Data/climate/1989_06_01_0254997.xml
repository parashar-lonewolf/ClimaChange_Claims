        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Yes, to increase safety and reduce environmental risks, Americans need better information. But ''Making a Risky Life Bearable'' (front page, May 9) presents biased assumptions as facts and diverts attention from environmentally induced illness and death to statistical bean-counting.</p>
        <p>It's easy to decide that ''somebody must live downwind from the garbage incinerator or within fallout range of the nuclear reactor,'' and to call these threats to health and environment ''necessary evils.'' But those whose health is threatened may find it more difficult to accept the hazard as inevitable.</p>
        <p>Nuclear reactors and garbage incinerators are certainly evil -producing radioactive waste and toxic gases and ash, respectively. But they are far from necessary, let alone justified on economic grounds. We can meet our energy needs more safely and cost-effectively with energy efficiency and renewable energy than with nuclear power. Waste reduction and recycling should be fully implemented before any more incinerators are built.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, most Americans seem to disagree with you. Public opposition, along with high costs, has stalemated the nuclear industry - no reactors have been ordered for more than 10 years. Who would buy your proposed solution of paying people to live near health hazards, a system that would trade money for health?</p>
        <p>The question of which risks in life are necessary evils involves value assumptions and policy choices that cannot be quantified and calculated by ''expert regulators.'' A policy that puts the Government's imprimatur on an acceptable death rate is not acceptable. BILL MAGAVERN  DANIEL BECKER  Washington, May 22, 1989  The writers are with, respectively, the U.S. Public Interest Research Group and the Sierra Club.</p>
