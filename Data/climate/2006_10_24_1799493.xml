        <p>Q. If scientists examined the rocks of Antarctica, could they expect to discover fossils?</p>
        <p>A. A considerable number of fossils have already been found in Antarctica, including some of dinosaurs, and scientists expect to find even more items of interest if global warming exposes rocky areas that are usually under ice.</p>
        <p>Many fossils are in the care of the British Antarctic Survey of the National Environment Research Council. Some of them are the familiar skeletons of ammonites (ancient spiraling marine invertebrates) and impressions of leaves, but some are the bones and teeth of fishes and marine reptiles.</p>
        <p>According to the survey, abundant finds of fossil leaves and wood point to the existence of extensive forestation in earlier geological periods, even to within a few degrees latitude of the South Pole itself. There are also remains of dinosaurs and marsupial mammals that later roamed across the surface.</p>
        <p>The American National Science Foundation announced major troves of dinosaur fossils in Antarctica in 1991, including the front half of a large skeleton that might have been as much as 25 feet long, as well as many smaller fragments.</p>
        <p>The fossils were from two warmer periods in the distant past, 200 million years ago and 75 million years ago.</p>
        <p>In 1969, the remains of Lystrosaurus, a 240-million-year-old mammal-like reptile, were excavated in Antarctica.</p>
