        <p>President Bush stood today in the well of Germany's reconstructed Reichstag and told Parliament that the terrorist groups the United States and its allies are hunting down constitute a ''new totalitarian threat,'' and in a clear reference to Hitler, compared the current struggle to a past generation's battle against those who ''killed in the name of racial purity.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's speech under the spectacular glass dome of the Reichstag, the symbol of a unified Germany, sought to reassure clearly skeptical Germans about his intentions as he pursues his next steps against terrorism, particularly in Iraq, and presses American interests in environmental protection and aid to developing nations. Many Europeans are also concerned about American policy in the Middle East and about American plans for NATO.</p>

        <p>President Bush stood today in the well of Germany's reconstructed Reichstag and told Parliament that the terrorist groups the United States and its allies are hunting down constitute a ''new totalitarian threat,'' and in a clear reference to Hitler, compared the current struggle to a past generation's battle against those who ''killed in the name of racial purity.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's speech under the spectacular glass dome of the Reichstag, the symbol of a unified Germany, sought to reassure clearly skeptical Germans about his intentions as he pursues his next steps against terrorism, particularly in Iraq, and presses American interests in environmental protection and aid to developing nations. Many Europeans are also concerned about American policy in the Middle East and about American plans for NATO.</p>
        <p>During a news conference with Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, he promised to consult with Germany and other allies before taking action against Iraq and its suspected weapons of mass destruction, but he made it clear that he would not back off, saying, ''We've got to deal with it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's remarks, the first by an American president in the Reichstag, were received politely. But his appearance was punctuated at one point by a demonstration by four members of a former East German Communist party who unveiled a banner that said ''Stop Your Wars.'' Mr. Bush missed a few beats of his speech, then kept speaking as a few members of Parliament walked out in protest.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush used much of the speech to celebrate Germany's achievements, and Europe's, in the 13 years since the Berlin Wall fell just feet from where he was speaking. ''Ours is the first generation in a hundred years that does not expect and does not fear the next European war,'' he said to applause that even some of his harshest critics seemed to join.</p>
        <p>Invoking the resolute declarations of Presidents Kennedy and Reagan during their visits to a divided Berlin, Mr. Bush made his case that the United States, an expanded NATO, and now Russia face a new mission: to defeat regimes that may place nuclear, chemical or biological weapons within reach of terrorists.</p>
        <p>''If these regimes and their terrorist allies were to perfect these capabilities, no inner voice of reason, no hint of conscience would prevent their use,'' he said, charging that terrorists hate ''Jews and Christians and all Muslims who disagree with them.''</p>
        <p>Turning to members of the Green Party and others in the chamber who have protested America's approach to terrorism as unilateral, extreme and a violation of international law, he said, ''Wishful thinking might bring comfort, but not security.''</p>
        <p>He appeared, at moments, to be invoking the lessons of the 1930's when efforts to appease Hitler failed, and he made it clear he did not plan to repeat the mistake. ''Call this a strategic challenge; call it, as I do, the axis of evil; call it by any name you choose, but let us speak the truth.'' He added, ''We must confront this conspiracy against our liberty and against our lives.''</p>
        <p>In the midst of his 20-hour visit here, Mr. Bush was clearly concerned about dampening expanding questions about the intelligence failures before the Sept. 11 attacks, including questions about what he knew. In his news conference, he insisted that he welcomes a Congressional investigation, but only ''in the Intelligence Committee,'' which, he said, understands ''the obligations of upholding our secrets and our sources and methods of collecting intelligence.''</p>
        <p>He deflected a question about whether he would release the Central Intelligence Agency analysis given to him on Aug. 6 that raised the possibility that Al Qaeda was trying to hijack American aircraft. But a senior administration official said in Washington that Mr. Bush would not set a precedent by turning over to Congress any copies of his classified Presidential Daily Briefing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush clearly knew he faced a skeptical audience, both in the chamber and across Europe. He seemed to adjust his tone to one of gentle persuasion rather than argument. He repeatedly thanked Germany for its contributions to the fight against the Taliban and Al Qaeda, an action that the Parliament authorized after considerable debate over the first deployment of German troops for battle since World War II.</p>
        <p>Carrying the comparisons to World War II and the cold war to the next step, the president said Sept. 11 marked a change of eras as dramatic as Pearl Harbor or the first days of the Berlin blockade, when the United States had to mount an airlift to keep the Western-controlled parts of the city fed.</p>
        <p>He carefully stepped around the most contentious subjects of disagreement, including his rejection of the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, his refusal to sign the treaty creating the International Criminal Court, and his decision to aid American steelmakers by imposing large tariffs on foreign-made steel. He started off by thanking the members of Parliament, as they sat in purple seats before jet-black desks, for coming into a special session to hear him. ''I can just imagine how my Congress would react if I called them back to hear a speech of mine when they were on vacation,'' he said to laughter.</p>
        <p>As he spoke, Mr. Bush's wife, Laura, who has been touring Europe in recent days, and members of his foreign policy team sat in the sleek glass-and-metal galleries that give the new home of Parliament an airy look inside the walls of the 108-year-old Reichstag building. Also along for the trip, which will include Russia, France and Italy, were Karen Hughes, the influential counselor who is leaving the White House this summer, and, notably, Karl Rove, his longtime policy adviser, whose presence seemed to underscore the expansion of his domestic political portfolio to global matters.</p>
        <p>Quickly, Mr. Bush and his team received a lesson in the politics of modern Europe. No sooner had they entered the chamber than Mr. Bush was both welcomed and directly challenged by the Parliament's president, Wolfgang Thierse, a member of Mr. Schröder's Social Democrats.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thierse complimented the American president for taking the time to assemble a coalition to fight terrorism, declaring, ''Your reaction to Sept. 11 proved that all those were wrong who thought a new American unilateralism was emerging.''</p>
        <p>But then Mr. Thierse warned, in comments clearly aimed at the visiting president, that the need for such coalitions extends to other arenas. ''The pursuit of unilateral interests proves short-sighted more and more frequently,'' he said, urging Mr. Bush to ''continue together on the road mapped out by the Kyoto protocol'' and to ratify the court treaty. Mr. Bush made it clear earlier in the day that he has no intention of reconsidering his opposition to the Kyoto treaty.</p>
        <p>In his whirlwind tour here, Mr. Bush did no sightseeing. His motorcade speeded through a sealed-off downtown, past both the reminders of the Nazi era and the cranes that are creating a new Berlin in the spaces left after the wall tumbled. He acknowledged at one point this morning his frustration at not seeing more, and not speaking to ordinary Germans -- the closest he came was an invitation-only crowd at a restaurant where he had dessert with Mr. Schröder on Wednesday night. But he said ''that's just life in the bubble'' of security that surrounds a president. He never mentioned another possible reason, the street protests that greeted his arrival.</p>
        <p>At the same time, he seemed attuned to the city's efforts to come to terms with its past and the historical sensitivities that still pervade the body politic here.</p>
        <p>''The history of our time is written in the life of Berlin,'' he said in his speech. ''In this building, the fires of hatred were set that swept across the world,'' he added, in an allusion to the burning of the Reichstag on Feb. 27, 1933, an act of arson that historians now view as the symbol of the death of parliamentary democracy in Germany as Hitler's National Socialists rose to power.</p>
        <p>At another point during the news conference, Mr. Bush used a line about Saddam Hussein that he frequently employs at home, calling him ''a dictator who gassed his own people.'' But it was striking in the context of Berlin: Mr. Bush spoke just a mile from the gathering point where, 60 years ago, Berlin's Jews were collected for transport to the concentration camps where many of them were gassed as well.</p>
        <p>Chancellor Schröder did not react to the comment. But at another point, the German leader, who faces a tough election fight this fall, continued to distance himself from Mr. Bush's clear willingness to use military action to unseat Mr. Hussein. With Mr. Bush standing next to him, Mr. Schröder said the world had to ''exercise a lot of political pressure'' to get international arms inspectors into Iraq. He urged that ''we not speculate'' about further action in Iraq until further consultations with the Bush administration.</p>
