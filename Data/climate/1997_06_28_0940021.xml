        <p>Tennis, anyone? Not at waterlogged Wimbledon, where, for the second consecutive day, any semblance of actual Grand Slam competition was washed away by a massive system of showers that closed overhead like a dark, gray fist and refused to move.</p>
        <p>While some 30,000 hardy, hopeful souls roamed the grounds and waited in vain for the two-hour ''bright spot'' promised by weather forecasters, the 200 players unlucky enough to find their names on today's schedule prowled the changing rooms and complained of cabin fever.</p>
        <p>Before today, Wimbledon had not been rained out for two consecutive days since 1909; the only other occasion where total washouts occurred on consecutive days was 1888, when three straight days were ruined. Even though the tournament has been able to whisk through as many as 110 matches in a single day, that day was rainless. There is not a rainless day in sight for London's SW19 until Tuesday.</p>
        <p>''There's only a certain amount of practices you can have, lunches you can have, games of backgammon you can have,'' said 14th-seeded Tim Henman, the host nation's best chance for a home-grown champion since Fred Perry won here in 1936, ''and it isn't great for us, but I do feel particularly sorry for all the people outside, because standing out in the rain is probably not what they wanted to do.''</p>
        <p>With more soggy weather predicted for the weekend, Wimbledon officials continued to ponder the prospect of opening the facility for play on the tournament's middle Sunday, a drastic measure that has been resorted to just once -- in 1991 -- in the history of this 121-year-old tournament. The high cost of staging a day of makeup matches on Sunday, estimated at more than $750,000 simply to provide services and security, became all the more daunting when meteorologists provided a preliminary forecast for Sunday. The operative word was rain.</p>
        <p>Frazzled rule makers on the All England Club's scheduling committee were also wrestling with the option of trimming the men's singles from its traditional three-of-five-set format to a two-of-three format, an arrangement sure to infuriate most Grand Slam purists. With just 94 matches completed, and with 32 more first-round encounters in limbo -- 6 on the men's side and 26 for the women -- desperate measures appeared imminent. However, after waiting until nearly 7 P.M. to abandon today's schedule, the club announced that it would not make a decision regarding its middle Sunday until 4 P.M. Saturday. The tournament is now 200 matches behind schedule.</p>
        <p>The 22-year-old Henman, who has worn the hopes of the star-starved host nation like a yoke since his quarterfinal breakthrough last year, has survived the first round. But he has found his second-round match against Jerome Golmard an experience akin to waiting for Godot. Will it ever arrive?</p>
        <p>''Like everyone has said, be patient, but I don't think that makes much difference,'' Henman said. ''I think the frustrating thing is the weather reports seem to be getting it right.'' While it was too soon to speak of Wimbledon's possibly being canceled by truculent weather for the first time, Henman said players were starting to resign themselves to a third week of play. The last time the men's singles final was played on the third Monday was 1988, when Stefan Edberg defeated Boris Becker.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't be surprised if there's play on the third Monday, and I would be delighted if I were still here on Monday,'' said Henman, who has yet to reach a Grand Slam finale, ''but I would not be so pleased if we were still in the first round.''</p>
        <p>Henman also said he would not like to see the tournament impose a two-of-three-set format on men's singles as it has already done for doubles. ''I think it would lead to quite a few upsets,'' said Henman, who would prefer to waive the second week's built-in rest days and play every day, even twice a day, rather than change the three-of-five format.</p>
        <p>''If this happened at the French, and you were playing five sets on clay, that's going to be very demanding physically,'' he said. ''Obviously, it's going to be mentally demanding, but I don't think it will be a problem on grass.''</p>
        <p>The players, many of whom have rented homes or apartments in Wimbledon village rather than suffer commuting to London, went home this evening hoping for a sea change. Venus Williams has not been able to make her Wimbledon debut on the court, but has already given a news conference in which she disclosed that she has whiled away the hours by shooting pool and playing just about every game except the one she came here for.</p>
        <p>''Right now I think it's best to stay calm and not become too anxious while I'm waiting to play,'' she said today. ''No one's had the chance to hit too much. No one is too used to English weather.''</p>
        <p>No one, that is, except for the English. Wimbledon does not give sure-fire rainchecks along with its refunds, but most of the spectators today seemed disinclined to hold a grudge against the tournament for spoiling their day.</p>
        <p>Mike Hayden and his aptly named girlfriend, Rayne Anderson, elected to cut their losses, toast each other with Wimbledon's signature drink, a Pimm's Cup, and head back to Sussex without the tennis fix they had been hoping for. After all, there's always next year.</p>
        <p>''We're having the typical English summer, what with global warming and all,'' Hayden, who had anticipated a soggy Friday, said.</p>
        <p>''You know, people here are very stoic, we're very phlegmatic; that's how we won the war,'' Hayden said of the stiff-upper-lip attitude that prevailed around the grounds. ''So we'll just have a Pimm's Cup and go along home.''</p>
