        <p>An agreement on new energy efficiency standards that would save the owner of a refrigerator about $120 during its life was announced yesterday by appliance manufacturers and the environmental group that has spearheaded the conservation effort.</p>
        <p>The United States Department of Energy was scheduled to issue energy guidelines on refrigerators in 1998. Jack Riggs, the principal deputy assistant secretary for policy at the department, said yesterday that the agreement would make it easier for the agency to "move quickly on this rule."</p>
        <p>The Natural Resources Defense Council and the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers said yesterday that their agreement eliminated the long haggling between the two groups that had accompanied the setting of past regulations on energy efficiency.</p>
        <p>"We have been able to work cooperatively on a difficult problem," David Goldstein, the energy program director for the council, an environmental group, said in an interview. "This is the first time that such a thing has happened in the energy area I can think of."</p>
        <p>To the manufacturers, the motivation was to remove some of the uncertainty about what the energy department would propose. Manufacturers can now start looking for ways to meet the new standards.</p>
        <p>Robert Holding, the president of the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, said the agreement "gives manufacturers a jump-start on research and development as well as product testing."</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, the most commonly used refrigerators will use about 500 kilowatt hours of electricity a year, compared with about 700 kilowatt hours now, a savings in power of about 30 percent.</p>
        <p>Consumers who buy refrigerators -- if the standards are adopted -- will save about $300 on their electrical bill during the lifespan of the appliance. The savings would be cut to about $120, because the new refrigerators are expected to cost more than current models, Mr. Goldstein said.</p>
        <p>Refrigerators are one of the largest users of electricity, making up about 20 percent of the consumption in a typical house. They also account for about 2 percent of the national consumption of electricity.</p>
        <p>The manufacturers have struggled to develop more efficient refrigerators and find substitutes for chlorofluorocarbon chemicals, or CFC's, used in refrigerant fluid. CFC emissions have been blamed for harming the protective ozone layer in the upper atmosphere.</p>
        <p>The Whirlpool Corporation, a manufacturer based in Benton Harbor, Mich., has cut the use of energy by about 25 percent in one line of refrigerators.</p>
        <p>The other groups that participated in the negotiations, which lasted two years, were the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, the New York State Energy Office, the California Energy Commission, and two utilities: the Pacific Gas and Electric Company and the Southern California Edison Corporation.</p>
