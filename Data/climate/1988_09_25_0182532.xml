        <p>LEAD: RICHARD T. DEWLING, for two and a half years the Commissioner of the State Department of Environmental Protection, has left office to start his own engineering company. He holds a doctorate in environmental science from Rutgers and is considered outspoken on environmental issues.</p>
        <p>RICHARD T. DEWLING, for two and a half years the Commissioner of the State Department of Environmental Protection, has left office to start his own engineering company. He holds a doctorate in environmental science from Rutgers and is considered outspoken on environmental issues.</p>
        <p>Dr. Dewling recently discussed some of the major issues he confronted during his tenure and commented on decisions that he said the state will have to make to curtail deterioration in environmental quality and to establish priorities for the future.</p>
        <p>Q. In your extensive career as an engineer and a civil servant, are there any particular achievements or disappointments that you would like to comment on?</p>
        <p>A. The reason you go into public service is because you believe you can effect change and improvement. Looking back over the years, the process has been very slow. If you look at progress in implementing the laws from where we were 10 years ago to where we are today, there's been dramatic improvement.</p>
        <p>Look at the Jersey Shore as an example. Ten years ago, along the Jersey Shore, there was 140 million gallons a day of improperly treated sewage. Today that's down to zero.</p>
        <p>Seventeen years ago, I sued the State of New Jersey and specifically some local towns, Belmar and Lavallette, working with the United States Attorney's office as a scientist. They were pumping sewage sludge a couple of hundred yards off the beach, and we stopped them from doing that. At that time when that legal action was taken, I was the villain. There was no local support for it, no state support for it. Now I look at the transition from where we were 17 years ago to today and I think it's fantastic.</p>
        <p>Q. When you took office in February 1986, you said you were impressed with the state's commitment, both financial and political, to environmental quality. You told an interviewer, ''You've got all the ingredients for success and if I fail, I'd have to blame myself.'' What are your thoughts about that statement today?</p>
        <p>A. I don't think we've failed in the sense that failure means that things are worse - things are better. The fact that we're able to garner 33 percent of the Federal budget this year says to me that we have the most aggressive hazardous-waste cleanup program. Now the hazardous-waste cleanup program is moving at a snail's pace because of the process of the law. It's slow and it's frustrating, but there is no site in New Jersey today that presents an imminent public health threat.</p>
        <p>Very seldom do you get a success that happens in six months or eight months or two years. The things in the environment didn't happen in two or three years; it's the result of 15, 20 or 40 years of insult. You've got to take corrective action and legal action. Frequently legal action doesn't lead to a rapid remediation of something. You get results by drawing the public's attention, getting the political machine involved and informing the media so you get the full reality of the problem and the process is speeded up.</p>
        <p>Q. What do you think are some of the major environmental issues in the state today?</p>
        <p>A. Solid waste. Fifty-two percent of New Jersey's garbage goes out of the state. I don't know how much longer that honeymoon is going to last. We've got garbage going to Ohio, Kentucky and Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>We haven't solved the problem. We've permitted five resource recovery facilities. Construction is underway at three of those facilities as we speak and one of them is on line, Warren County, burning garbage. We sited three new landfills in the state. We have a self-sufficiency by 1992.</p>
        <p>Garbage rates have skyrocketed. I would have thought that that would have gotten more people angry than it has. I objected to the legislative proposal to have a $250 million give-back program to the public for rate shock for garbage. Once you do that, then the problem goes away.</p>
        <p>People have to realize that the garbage problem is real. One way you get their attention, unfortunately, is that you hit them in the pocketbook.</p>
        <p>Q. Last year, homeowners were encouraged by the Environmental Protection Agency to test for naturally occurring radon. How effective has the response been?</p>
        <p>A. It's been disappointing, very disappointing, in spite of the fact that a home can be tested for $15 or $20 and you can can take corrective actions relatively cheaply. We even set up a loan program through the state, where people could apply for loans. I think we've had two or three people apply for loans at 7 or 8 percent.</p>
        <p>Q. Why is the response so ineffective?</p>
        <p>A. You can't see it, you can't feel it, you can't get mad at anybody. It's no different than the ozone. You can get people excited about the greenhouse effect. But the ozone at ground level is just as much of a public health problem, if not more. We've had more days this year of ozone violation than we've had previously, and what's the biggest source of ozone, automobile exhaust.</p>
        <p>The bottom line is that if you want continued improvement in the quality of life, there have to be some significant social changes over the next 10 years.</p>
        <p>Q. How safe are the beaches in New Jersey? What steps have been taken to prevent the problems that have been occurring on regional beaches?</p>
        <p>A. Water quality, measured from the standpoint of bacterial or chemical contamination, was excellent. If you walk into the water and you see a floatable there, whether it be a tampon applicator, a Twinkie or a piece of plastic, I don't care how the water quality is described, you will not go in that water if it looks unsightly. You've got an esthetic condition plus a condition dealing with the chemical and bacteriological quality.</p>
        <p>I had a group of scientists from Woods Hole and recognized medical schools to review last summer's incidents to find out if we could have done anything different. Basically they said that the primary reason we've had degradation in water quality along the coastal waters has been uncontrolled development.</p>
        <p>The focus is what I call non-point-source pollution. For example, the Navesink River: we controlled all of the industrial and municipal sources of pollution yet we could not utilize the shellfish in the area. Why? New Jersey has more horse farms than Kentucky. We had horse manure that runs off into the river. The horses become a major source of pollution.</p>
        <p>When we have beach closings, they're usually immediately following a rainfall. What happens after the rainfall is the runoff from the streets. In the streets are dog droppings, oil droppings, litter, connected to a pipe that runs out into Barnegat Bay or into the ocean. And that's why when we have beach closures, we usually have them following a rainstorm.</p>
        <p>Q. Ocean dumping has been the subject of much controversy over the last few years. What is the state's involvement, especially regarding the disposal of sludge?</p>
        <p>A. Since last year, we stopped ocean dumping, sludge dumping, at the 12-mile site. We stopped the wood burning off the coast during the summer months, which was a problem the previous year.</p>
        <p>Q. What about the 106-mile site?</p>
        <p>A. We're saying that New Jersey is committed to getting out of the ocean and using land-based alternatives. But remember, it's not done without environmental risk. The sludge in the ocean has to be brought back on the land and either incinerated or land-applied.</p>
        <p>Q. What is the impact of incineration on air quality?</p>
        <p>A. There's no such thing as zero risk. What I'm saying is that the decision you have to make about the environment is to choose alternatives that have the least damaging effect.</p>
        <p>If it is out in the ocean, who watches it? If it's on land, you can make midcourse corrections more rapidly and you can watch it better. We do not believe in the theory that dilution is the solution to pollution.</p>
        <p>Q. Do you feel that there are too many laws and not enough action?</p>
        <p>A. The environment, historically, has been a knee-jerk legislative reaction to solving problems as opposed to going back to the cores of the problem. The Department of Environmental Protection and Environmental Protection Agency are not action agencies, they're reaction agencies.</p>
        <p>We have come out with the necessity, with the cooperation of the Governor's office, of forming a coastal commission. Why do you need a coastal commission? To do the proper planning and to do the proper management of the coastal resources.</p>
        <p>Q. It's been over a year since Governor Kean's proposal for a 15-member Coastal Commission that would be especially sensitive to problems among the communities along the coast. What is the status of the Coastal Commission?</p>
        <p>A. It's hung up in the Legislature. The most frustrating thing I've had to deal with in the last four years is the inability to get through the Legislature a natural resources bill. Everybody agrees it's needed but can't agree on how it can be funded. It's needed to the tune of $50 million a year.</p>
        <p>Q. One last thing, a quote you made at the beginning of your tenure, ''The biggest difficulty where government has failed, I think, on some environmental issues is our ability to convince the public that the decisions we're making are based on sound science and the best public health information we have.'' Do you want to comment on that now?</p>
        <p>A. Yes. I think that's still true. One of the things I think government has failed to do is provide enough of an understanding of the issues we've done a great job of making people aware of problems, but we've done a lousy job of providing a thorough understanding of the trade-offs and the issues that have to be dealt with when decisions are made.</p>
        <p>The whole issue of hazardous waste, solid waste, we need an education program. If you don't want a landfill, then what do you want? If you don't want an incinerator, what do you want? Everybody wants it picked up; nobody wants it put down.</p>
        <p>But we have failed in my view to provide the types of balance where people can make a rational decision about the alternatives.</p>
