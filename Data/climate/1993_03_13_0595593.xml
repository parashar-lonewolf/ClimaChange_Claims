        <p>Expecting a winter storm to pound the New York region today, the authorities prepared for a blizzard posing a particular threat to areas of high elevation as well as to coastal communities.</p>
        <p>By early this morning, snow and heavy winds had begun to batter Alabama, Georgia and Florida. The storm is expected to begin a devastating swing along the Eastern seaboard early today.</p>
        <p>With one state official warning of a "hurricane with snow" for Long Island, Suffolk County officials declared a disaster emergency yesterday afternoon and ordered the evacuation of much of Fire Island.</p>
        <p>About 300 people were expected to leave the island, hoping to do so before gale-force winds made the trips too dangerous, said David Fischler, chief fire marshal of Suffolk County.</p>
        <p>"The idea was to get them moving before it was an emergency," Chief Fischler said. Entry to Fire Island Closed</p>
        <p>Last night in Robert Moses State Park, the police set up a barricade and forbade drivers to enter Fire Island. Officers said they had gone door to door, insisting that people leave, the only time the police could remember doing so.</p>
        <p>Boats had come from the island all night long, officers said, docking in the Captree Boat Basin and being met by cars from the mainland. The last ferry left at 6 P.M.</p>
        <p>"After the last storm, people are evacuating a lot easier," said Mike Bushell, a park police officer.</p>
        <p>Disaster officials in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut said the timing of the storm was fortunate. It was expected to hit hardest on the weekend, when commuter traffic would be light, but the authorities were able to prepare on a weekday, when people were available to make plans and to position emergency workers.</p>
        <p>Some airlines, including Delta and TWA, canceled almost all flights after noon today. Others, like American Airlines, decided to wait until this morning before making any blanket cancellations.</p>
        <p>Robert Young, duty manager for operations at Kennedy International Airport, said the airport would stay open as long as possible, but he encouraged passengers with departures scheduled for today to check with their airlines.</p>
        <p>Weather forecasters and emergency workers told residents to brace for the worst.</p>
        <p>"It will be one of the top storms of the century," said Dan Graf, a meteorologist with the Weather Communications Group at Penn State University. "The winds with this storm will be historic." He and others warned of serious coastal flooding.</p>
        <p>In New York, Frances Miesell, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service, said winds of 30 to 50 miles per hour were expected, with gusts up to 70. She said snow was expected to start falling in the New York metropolitan area between 3 A.M. and 5 A.M. and continue through the day, with accumulations ranging from 6 to 12 inches.</p>
        <p>The weather service issued a blizzard warning for the region and a coastal flood warning for parts of New Jersey, Long Island and New York City. Light snow and subfreezing temperatures were reported in parts of Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia. Early this morning, heavy wet flakes of snow began sticking on houses and sidewalks in Washington.</p>
        <p>The emergency broadcast system was activated yesterday in New Jersey and New York, with stations warning listeners and viewers to avoid travel.</p>
        <p>Emergency management coordinators in several states began working with the Red Cross and other agencies to plan for opening shelters today. But the New York Police Department said it had no special plans to set up emergency assistance for the homeless beyond the ordinary for a winter weekend.</p>
        <p>Utilities, like the Long Island Lighting Company and Jersey Central Power and Light, had crews standing by. Road crews were making similar preparations.</p>
        <p>New Jersey officials told motorists to expect speed reductions and a ban on trailers and motorcycles on the turnpike today. Effects of a Hurricane</p>
        <p>If the storm develops as forecasters expect, it will have all the effects of a hurricane along the Atlantic Coast and those of a major winter snowstorm inland, said Jim Wagner, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service Climate Analysis Center at Camp Springs, Md.</p>
        <p>Where those two effects would be felt depends on the storm's track, which could not be predicted with certainty, Mr. Wagner said.</p>
        <p>Computer models forecast that it would churn northeastward along a corridor through all the major metropolitan centers from Washington to New York, with the heaviest snow expected to fall west of the storm's center, he said. The strongest winds should be felt eastward.</p>
        <p>In any event, Paul G. Knight, also at the Penn State Weather Communications Group, said that when the storm arrived, it would bring atmospheric pressures "as low as they have ever been in New York City" in the wintertime. The most intense winter storm on record in New York was on March 1, 1914, he said.</p>
        <p>Forecasters were predicting hurricane-force wind gusts in some places, mainly in exposed areas of high elevation and in coastal areas. "Certainly," said Mr. Knight, "there'll be gusts over hurricane force in much of the city. On building tops, it could gust to 100 miles an hour." Still Cleaning Up</p>
        <p>Concern was high in coastal communities still cleaning up after a major storm on Dec. 11 that caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage and left many counties designated as Federal disaster areas.</p>
        <p>Eileen Powell was preparing to leave her house along the Milford, Conn., shore yesterday as her husband moved furniture upstairs and got items off the floor of the garage in anticipation of the storm. She planned to stay inland with a daughter.</p>
        <p>The Powells have lived in the house since 1986, but Mrs. Powell began spending summer vacations there as a child in 1939. In recent years, "we redid the whole house, so I am anxious about damage," she said.</p>
        <p>The Army Corps of Engineers is studying whether to undertake a major project in Milford that would raise up to 70 houses to protect them from flooding. Many homes suffered substantial damage in the Dec. 11 storm. Flakes Fell on Alabama</p>
        <p>The storm began its journey yesterday up the Eastern Seaboard. Residents of Birmingham, Ala., expecting it to hit in the afternoon, were surprised when the first flakes started falling during the morning rush hour. Schools immediately began canceling classes, and residents headed to grocery stores to stock up.</p>
        <p>Forecasters predicted 4 to 10 inches of snow in the Birmingham area, winds of up to 40 miles per hour and a wind-chill factor of 10 degrees below zero by this morning.</p>
        <p>Sea levels reportedly rose up to 20 feet in the Gulf of Mexico, and Coast Guard officials said fishing boats fled for shore. Strawberry farmers in Louisiana tried to save their ripening fruit with frost-control systems.</p>
        <p>The potential historic nature of the storm was underscored by its falling on the anniversary of the blizzard of 1888, which dumped two feet of snow on the region and severed New York from the rest of the world.</p>
