        <p>LEAD: THOUGH the ozone layer is eroding and there are signs that the global atmosphere is warming up, many leaders of third world countries have felt that environmentalism is a luxury they simply cannot afford.</p>
        <p>THOUGH the ozone layer is eroding and there are signs that the global atmosphere is warming up, many leaders of third world countries have felt that environmentalism is a luxury they simply cannot afford.</p>
        <p>It is fine, they say, for countries like the United States and Britain to become born-again environmentalists and call for a ban on chlorofluorocarbons - those useful industrial chemicals whose longevity is both their advantage and their curse. But many poorer countries are too preoccupied with getting modern products like refrigerators to their people to spend much time worrying about the atmospheric effect of the chemicals circulating through the cooling tubes.</p>
        <p>Western officials were encouraged, then, when China and India joined an international forum on the ozone problem last week in Helsinki, Finland. Because of the two countries' enormous populations, their rush to develop threatens to cancel out the environmental efforts of the industrialized world.</p>
        <p>Following the lead of Britain and the United States, the 80 countries at the conference resolved to go beyond the Montreal Protocol of 1987 and eliminate the production of chlorofluorocarbons and other chemicals eating at the ozone shield by the year 2000.</p>
        <p>Most significantly, the delegates agreed that some kind of financial aid would be necessary to help poorer countries develop environmentally sound alternatives.</p>
        <p>But it is easier to make pronouncements than to carry them out. The industrial countries balked at demands to establish an international pool of money to help less developed nations comply with the ban, preferring a more informal and economical approach. As a compromise, delegates adopted a vaguely worded resolution recognizing ''the urgent need to establish international financial and other mechanisms,'' not excluding ''the possibility'' of an international fund. And they agreed to establish an ''open-ended working group'' to figure out the details. The key word here may be ''open-ended.'' The group is not scheduled to report its findings until next year.</p>
