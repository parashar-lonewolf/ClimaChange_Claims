        <p>The Clinton Administration today said it would significantly broaden opportunities for industries to cut the costs of pollution control through a novel method that relies on free markets rather than regulations to decide where and how to clean up the environment.</p>
        <p>The proposal is one in a broad package of changes in environmental and other regulations the Administration put forth today. More than a year in the making, the package is a central part of the White House strategy for fending off a campaign by Congressional Republicans to roll back Federal rules governing health, safety and the environment.</p>
        <p>Administration officials said the changed rules would eventually save industries billions of dollars a year. The immediate political question is whether they will enable the Administration to fend off the anti-regulation onslaught in Congress.</p>
        <p>Legislation to reduce Federal regulations has passed the House and is approaching what promises to be a heated debate in the Senate. So the White House generated a blitz of publicity for its changes, which do not require new legislation and ordinarily would be considered too arcane to deserve much prominence.</p>
        <p>President Clinton traveled to a print shop in the Virginia suburbs that he said exemplified how the changes would make it easier for small businesses, which he said would face less paperwork, fewer fines, and more flexibility in complying with Federal rules.</p>
        <p>"We do need to reduce paperwork and unnecessary regulations, but I don't think we want to freeze efforts to protect our children from unsafe toys or unsafe foods," Mr. Clinton said, referring to a Republican proposal to impose a yearlong moratorium on most new Federal regulations. The House has approved the plan, which is under consideration in the Senate.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore, briefing reporters before the President outlined the new policies, called those Republican proposals "extremist and completely unacceptable."</p>
        <p>But Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, said the changes the Administration proposed were inadequate. In a written statement, Mr. Dole said the President was "trying to have it both ways" by joining the anti-regulatory crusade while condemning the Republican proposals.</p>
        <p>"Easing the burdens of compliance is a welcome first step, but misses the point that real reform means getting rid of unnecessary and overburdensome regulations," Mr. Dole said.</p>
        <p>Many of the proposals offered today deal with the mundane annoyances faced by businesses large and small, like the print shop Mr. Clinton chose as the setting for a speech today. The shop's owner must fill out 20 forms on toxic emissions that the Administration said would be replaced by a single form. The Administration also said it would waive penalties and grant grace periods for small businesses if they are trying in good faith to comply with regulations.</p>
        <p>But other changes, like several planned by the Environmental Protection Agency, could save billions of dollars each year for major industries, like the chemical industry, officials said. The most notable would be the expansion of trading in pollution credits and allowances, a novelty introduced by the Clean Air Act of 1990 and until now mainly restricted to sulfur dioxide, the pollutant that contributes to acid rain.</p>
        <p>Citing the success of the acid rain program in lowering the costs of pollution control for electric utilities and other industries, the Administration said it would now adopt the same approach in its efforts to control smog and water pollution.</p>
        <p>Under this approach, companies that surpass pollution standards can earn extra credits that they may sell as if they were commodities like soybean futures or stock options. The credits could be bought by companies that are falling short of pollution standards. If the market works efficiently, the overall level of pollution will decline, but the gains will come at the lowest possible price.</p>
        <p>The details of the trading schemes have not yet been worked out, and in some cases, especially where water pollution is involved, they will be complicated to develop, agency officials conceded.</p>
        <p>Other changes in environmental rules will alter the definitions of hazardous wastes and the regulations for disposing of them.</p>
        <p>President Clinton also told the Environmental Protection Agency to pick 50 demonstration projects, granting companies, communities and perhaps even entire industries more flexibility in deciding for themselves how to control pollution.</p>
        <p>"I think it is damn good," said Don Ritter, a former Republican Congressman who has long been critical of environmental regulatory practices and is now chairman of the National Environmental Policy Institute, which is recommending changes to the existing rules.</p>
