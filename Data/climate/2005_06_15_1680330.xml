        <p>Hoping to break a long legislative deadlock over energy issues, the Senate on Tuesday returned to a broad power proposal stuffed with the same politically combustible issues that have derailed past legislation -- including fuel consumption, industry benefits, oil and gas drilling and pollution.</p>
        <p>Now, with President Bush pressing Congress to deliver an energy bill this summer, the Senate is adding yet another contentious issue to the mix: global warming.</p>
        <p>Lawmakers say the Senate could consider as many as three competing initiatives intended to reduce emissions of gases believed to contribute to climate change, a sign of heightened Congressional interest in an issue that was largely sidestepped during the fruitless energy bill debate two years ago.</p>
        <p>Approval of any emissions plan could significantly complicate efforts to reach a compromise with the House, where architects of a bill approved in April strongly oppose new federal requirements to cut so-called greenhouse gases. But that is just one potential sticking point.</p>
        <p>Lawmakers will also have to resolve an impasse over a House-approved plan to provide manufacturers of the gasoline additive MTBE with some protection from product liability suits arising out of water pollution. The Senate, where there is deep opposition to that idea, is expected to provide no such immunity.</p>
        <p>While the ultimate fate of the measure may hinge on the ability of the House and Senate to resolve their differences, Senate authors must first steer their measure to passage.</p>
        <p>''Remember, we are in the United States Senate, where senators have a chance to work their will, where there's a myriad of ideas about how America should move through this very, very difficult time,'' said Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico and chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.</p>
        <p>After Democrats complained in 2003 that they were shut out of writing the energy legislation, Mr. Domenici took a more bipartisan approach this year. He and Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, the senior Democrat on the energy panel, produced a bill that was sent to the floor with strong backing from both parties.</p>
        <p>But Democrats say they will push to make the measure more to their liking. Trying to stake out territory on issues that often cut more along geographic lines than political lines, Democratic lawmakers intend to offer an amendment that would seek a 40 percent reduction in the nation's reliance on imported oil within 20 years.</p>
        <p>''It is time that the Senate give a message that they believe that energy independence is an important criteria,'' said Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington and a chief sponsor of the amendment.</p>
        <p>The Senate measure calls on the president to take steps to reduce United States oil consumption by one million barrels a day within 10 years, but critics say the provision is weak and unenforceable. Democrats also intend to use the energy bill to increase automotive fuel efficiency standards as a way to cut consumption, though past efforts have failed.</p>
        <p>The White House on Tuesday endorsed the Senate proposal, calling it ''largely consistent'' with Mr. Bush's own energy goals. But the administration said that it was not convinced of the need for any climate change provisions and that it would oppose a plan by Mr. Bingaman to require utilities to increase their use of renewable fuels</p>
        <p>Over all, the measure could cost up to $36 billion over 10 years if all the projects were ultimately approved. On Thursday the Senate Finance Committee is expected to consider tax provisions that would add about $16 billion to the price tag, including tax credits for energy efficiency and hybrid vehicles estimated at more than $5 billion -- 10 times the level of the House bill. The White House wants only $6.7 billion in tax incentives.</p>
        <p>Leaders of the Washington environmental lobby say that they consider the Senate bill an improvement over the House measure but that neither takes the steps necessary to solve America's energy problems while the Senate measure could open the door to a push for new nuclear power plants.</p>
        <p>Among other divisive issues is a proposal to give the federal government new power to force communities to allow terminals for the importation of liquefied natural gas, an idea opposed by many state and local officials.</p>
        <p>The Senate has dodged one issue that has vexed past energy bills -- the prospect of drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge -- by addressing the drilling through a budget bill. The Senate bill does call for an inventory of offshore oil and gas resources, and on Tuesday, Florida senators threatened to filibuster the measure if it encouraged drilling off the Gulf Coast.</p>
