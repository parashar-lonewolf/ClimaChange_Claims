        <p>TRUST IS HOT. EVEN THE MOST contrarian pundit agrees that this Presidential election will be decided on which candidate is most trusted by the voters.</p>
        <p>At an April 15 rally outside Philadelphia, Bob Dole put it this way: "If something happened along the route and you had to leave your children with Bob Dole or Bill Clinton, I think you'd probably leave your children with Bob Dole. . . . It all boils down to, Who do you trust?"</p>
        <p>In his riposte, Bill Clinton told a dinner of White House correspondents in  May: "Let's say that you were going on vacation for a couple of weeks -- who do  you trust to water your plants -- Bob Dole or Bill Clinton? . . . You go home tonight, and you decide to order a pizza -- who do you trust to select the toppings?"</p>
        <p>Because the nonpartisan rigor of this language column is a wonder to behold,  no position is here taken on the puissance of the original Dole thrust or the quality of derision in the Clinton counterthrust. This is my biennial (that's every second year; biannual is twice a year) item about the persnickety who/whom.</p>
        <p>Is it who do you trust or whom do you trust?</p>
        <p>That's easy: because who is nominative and whom is objective, and the sentence parses as you/trust/the object, then it should be you/trust/him, or whom, not he or who. Thus the correct question should be "Whom do you trust?"</p>
        <p>Say wha'? That's the sort of advice you get from a person whose icy secretary says, "Whom should I say is calling?" We are faced here with what grammarians as renowned as Henry Fowler and Otto Jespersen discussed as "the hypercorrect whom."</p>
        <p>Whom has its place in current usage. As the object of a preposition, whom not only is right but also feels right, as in "For Whom the Bell Tolls." Similarly,  "To Whom It May Concern" is natural; "To Who" would be anathema to a native speaker. Whom also feels right in "the one whom we feared," not "the one who we  fear" (unless more is added: "He is the one who we feared would win the election").</p>
        <p>But at the beginning of a sentence, whom comes across as an affectation. In politics, formality went out with neckties, and what is comfortable to the listener's ear is to be proferred in address. Whoever the coming election favors will begin his sentences with who -- despite the correctness of whomever in that instance -- and he will thank whomever he wants for pointing this out.</p>
        <p>Therefore, the time has come to provide a corollary to Safire's Law, which is "Whenever whom is correct, recast the sentence." The corollary is "Who begins a  sentence with whom will never be elected President of anything." (In that sentence, who is nominative, or substantive, or subjective -- pick one; they all mean the same -- and is right in its own right, not just because it comes at the beginning.)</p>
        <p>Who do you trust? On this, trust me, than whom there is none more contemptuous of pandering.</p>
        <p>Ish Bin Ein Punster</p>
        <p>"Labor is talking the ish," said Benjamin Netanyahu in his campaign for Prime Minister in Israel, "and we're talking the issues."</p>
        <p>That was a bilingual pun. Ish means "the man" in Hebrew; Netanyahu was saying that his opponents were turning away from the issues of the campaign to concentrate on him as an individual, as an ish.</p>
        <p>A few years ago, after making a mistake that seemed to cast scorn on a former colleague, I admitted to a Schadenfreudean slip. That was a play on the German Schadenfreude, "guiltily taking pleasure in the suffering of friends," and Freudian slip, "a mistake revealing subconscious attitudes," based on teachings of Sigmund Freud, the one-man Prozac of his day.</p>
        <p>With bilingualism on the rise, are bilingual puns increasing? Lexicographic Irregulars are urged to send examples to Punmeister, The New York Times, 1627 Eye Street NW, Washington, D.C. 20006. (Actually, it's I Street, but the I looks like the numeral 1 and everybody gets confused, causing addressees to call it Eye Street. If you're naming streets by letter, skip I.)</p>
        <p>Bumf</p>
        <p>The Economist magazine considered the impending issuance of a lengthy report by  the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and warmly welcomed it as "two thousand pages of bumf."</p>
        <p>"Is The Economist playing a little joke?" asks Marjorie Pastel Martin of Westport, Conn. "The pronunciation is very awkward."</p>
        <p>My first thought was that bumf was a recent derivation from bomfog, an Americanism meaning "bombast, bloviation, empty talk," rooted in an acronym used by reporters covering Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, who liked to use the expression "brotherhood of Man, fatherhood of God."</p>
        <p>In an 1889 dictionary of slang by Barrere and Leland, however, the word is described as schoolboys' slang and defined as "paper. . . . A bumf-hunt is a paper-chase." The Oxford English Dictionary supplement provides an up-to-date definition and a grittier etymology. Bumf, also spelled bumph, is "toilet-paper" (which Americans have euphemized to toilet tissue, and further to facial tissue; down the toilet has gone down the drain).</p>
        <p>In 1912, the novelist Virginia Woolf wrote to Lytton Strachey: "Is this letter written upon Bumf? It looks like it." The etymology is bum-fodder, with bum meaning the buttocks, and fodder, originally "leaves and stalks," now "stuffing."</p>
        <p>In current British usage, bumf is a contemptuous reference to a stack of documents, and is a useful contribution to the political lexicon.</p>
