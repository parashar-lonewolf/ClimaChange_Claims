        <p>LEAD: The bright days of spring show up the drabness that winter left behind, and one of the more visible reminders is an automobile covered with the residue of snow, sleet and neglect - a car that's crying for a wash and wax.</p>
        <p>The bright days of spring show up the drabness that winter left behind, and one of the more visible reminders is an automobile covered with the residue of snow, sleet and neglect - a car that's crying for a wash and wax.</p>
        <p>But which wax or polish do you use? And how often? Experts say there is no easy answer to the first question, since waxes, polishes and all the other patent medicines for an automobile's body vary in purpose, as well as in price and quality.</p>
        <p>''I guess we'd put products into two categories,'' said Gary Balint, an engineering supervisor in the Ford Motor Company's parts and service division. ''There are waxes, and there are polishes. Waxes would be something like the old carnauba wax: stiffer, more difficult to put on. Polishes would be abrasive, something like rubbing compound. But most of what you buy today is a combination.''</p>
        <p>No matter the product, some precautions should be taken. Jim Colyer, manager of technical services for the Pontiac division of General Motors, said his company recommends against waxing for at least six weeks after buying a new car.</p>
        <p>''We know that aging has an effect on the durability,'' he said. ''We do bake it, but new paint, coming out of a plant, is still fairly soft.''</p>
        <p>Both men say finishes on today's cars are far more durable than those of the past. Most manufacturers now apply a clear protective coat over the base color, and fading, chipping and cracking are less a problem than they used to be.  Paint Oxidized by Sunlight</p>
        <p>Still, waxing is a necessary evil, and most owners' manuals include a section on waxing. ''Washing helps,'' Mr. Colyer said, ''especially in the northern areas with snow and the stuff they put on the roads. And the wax protects the paint from that and from the sunlight.''</p>
        <p>Automatic car washes are the easiest way to get rid of the grime, but they have their drawbacks. Those with giant brushes can scratch the paint, and those with a simultaneous spray wax can leave a wax deposit on the windshield. ''It will build up on your wipers,'' Mr. Balint said, ''and you'll need to clean them with concentrated windshield washer solution.''</p>
        <p>Without regular attention, and occasionally even with it, paint will oxidize and fade under the sun's ultraviolet rays. When that happens, the layer of ''dead'' paint can be removed with rubbing compound, although Mr. Balint cautioned that base coat-clear coat finishes can be harmed by abrasives in some compounds.</p>
        <p>Acid rain is another enemy of paint. A hard rain may seem to leave a car clean and shining, but the acid remains, a result of sulfur dioxide and other pollutants in the air. The experts say it is important to wash the car as soon as possible after a storm, or at least to rinse it with clear water.</p>
        <p>Bug and tar remover can help with the acid problem. ''It's always good to get bugs or tar off right away,'' Mr. Balint said. ''That sort of thing can really hurt the paint, especially when it mixes with dew or moisture in the air and forms an acid.''  Wax Comes Off in Washing</p>
        <p>All of that means regular attention, but it must be remembered that each washing removes a bit of wax. When Consumer Reports tested car waxes, for example, it found significant differences in durability among various brands. But it noted that even the nine waxes it rated highest in durability were gone after eight washings.</p>
        <p>''If your car's finish has lost a good deal of its gleam,'' the report said, ''consider the Du Pont Rain Dance paste - it appreciably improved the gloss on dull surfaces and held up through repeated washings. Other brands shined as well but didn't last as long. If your car badly needs a shine, you might want to use a special polishing or rubbing compound to remove dead paint first.''</p>
        <p>Rain Dance is now made by Borden, using the original Du Pont formula. Turtle Wax, another popular brand, is promoted as nonabrasive, meaning that it is safe for newer cars. Simoniz, made by First Brands Corporation, is perhaps the best known of the waxes.</p>
        <p>The amount of effort required to produce a shine is another thing to consider. Liquid waxes are generally easier to apply, but don't last as long. Often they are also combined with chemicals and abrasives to help remove dirt and oxidized paint.</p>
        <p>And remember, if you apply the liquid or paste to a large area at one time, the wax will dry and be difficult to buff. Experts also caution against using regular car wax on a vinyl roof or on ''blackout'' trim. Special products are made for those finishes.</p>
        <p>Finally, the experts say, be careful when using rubbing compound. They come in different levels of abrasion, and should be used sparingly; too much zeal and the shine you see will be that of bare metal.</p>
