        <p>LEAD: For environmental and public health groups seeking to strengthen the Clean Air Act, this seemed to be the year to do it. It has been 10 years since the last major revisions were made in the antigress seemed to have several compelling reasons for making changes this year. The first is a Dec. 31 deadline by which cities must lower smog and carbon monoxide to levels deemed necessary to protect human health, as prescribed in the current law.</p>
        <p>For environmental and public health groups seeking to strengthen the Clean Air Act, this seemed to be the year to do it. It has been 10 years since the last major revisions were made in the antigress seemed to have several compelling reasons for making changes this year. The first is a Dec. 31 deadline by which cities must lower smog and carbon monoxide to levels deemed necessary to protect human health, as prescribed in the current law. As many as 60 of the cities may not meet the deadline, and many of them could face damaging economic sanctions unless the law is changed to extend the deadline.</p>
        <p>Another reason for action by Congress is that 1988 is an election year, when many representatives and senators would rather not have to cast recorded votes on sensitive environmental issues. Environmentalists assert that the law should be strengthened to protect human health from air pollution and the environment from acid rain. Prospects for Bill Appear Dim</p>
        <p>But despite these pressures, prospects for new legislation on clean air by Dec. 31, the 17th anniversary of the date President Nixon signed the Clean Air Act into law, now appear dim.</p>
        <p>Lee M. Thomas, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said Tuesday that he intended to use ''maximum flexibility'' under the law in his use of sanctions. But agency officials concede that the law requires a ban on the construction of factories and other sources of pollution in areas where cities are not making progress toward meeting the clean air rules.</p>
        <p>Representative Bill Green, Republican of Manhattan, said that Congress has proved unable so far to balance the competing regional and economic interests and the ''philosophical'' differences among those with a stake in the outcome of the debate. States in the Middle West, where power plants produce much of the pollution that returns to the earth as acid rain, are loath to install the expensive equipment that would reduce acid fallout in New York and New England. Areas that produce coal with a high content of sulfur, an ingredient in acid rain, do not want new regulations that would lead coal consumers to switch to low-sulfur coal.</p>
        <p>States without a pollution problem, particularly in the West, do not see why they should have to pay for subsidizing expensive control actions in states where there is a problem. Congressmen from areas where the automobile industry is important, including Representative John D. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, do not want to force the automobile companies to install expensive antipollution devices. Waxman Wants Stronger Law</p>
        <p>Mr. Dingell and the chairman of his committee's Subcommittee on Health and the Environment, Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, have been unable so far to reconcile differences over the clean air legislation. Mr. Waxman has been pushing for strong amendments to the clean air law.</p>
        <p>Another obstacle has been the Reagan Administration's opposition to any major changes in the clean air law, particularly to acid rain legislation.</p>
        <p>While the Energy Committee has thus far been unable to fashion a bill to change the law because of internal disagreements, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee has prepared far-reaching legislation, much of it by Senator George J. Mitchell, Democrat of Maine. Senator Mitchell's bill would extend the deadlines by varying periods, depending on the severity of pollution problems in different cities. It would also impose more stringent rules on cities unable to meet the deadline and require new pollution control equipment for vehicles.</p>
        <p>The Senate bill would also create a national program to reduce the pollution that causes acid rain by requiring controls on emissions from power plants, factories, autos and trucks. But whether the Senate bill will be voted on is still unknown. The Senate majority Leader, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, has expressed strong concern about the impact of controls on acid rain on his state's coal mining industry. 'An Institutional Embarrassment'</p>
        <p>''As 1988 approaches, the continued Congressional stalemate on clean air is an institutional embarrassment,'' said Richard E. Ayres, chairman of the National Clean Air Coalition, an alliance of environmental and health groups.</p>
        <p>Despite the lobbying by the environmental groups, it seems more likely that Congress will opt for an interim solution this year, by extending the deadlines for compliance with the current law in order to head off punitive sanctions. This solution, in theory, would give the cities a period for improvements while Congress took time for a consideration of a permanent solution.</p>
        <p>But there already is sharp debate over how long the deadline should be extended. Mr. Dingell and others want an ''adequate extension'' to allow time to resolve all the issues. Representative John P. Murtha, Democrat of Pennsylvania, proposed a two-year extension to be adopted as part of the House's continuing appropriations resolutions. Environmentalists and their allies in Congress said that such an extension would only provide an excuse for delaying action on strengthening the Clean Air Act until the next Congress. They insist that the grace period, if any, should be limited to six or eight months.</p>
