        <p>A GEOLOGIST studying plant fossils in Wyoming has found evidence of a "winter" in June 65 million years ago.

        <p>A GEOLOGIST studying plant fossils in Wyoming has found evidence of a "winter" in June 65 million years ago. The discovery provides further support for the theory that an extraterrestrial object crashed into Earth, kicking up enough debris to block out sunlight and creating a global darkness that set off mass extinctions of life.</p>
        <p>By examining fossilized leaves, Dr. Jack A. Wolfe of the United States Geological Survey in Denver said he had determined that land and aquatic plants died at about the same time. Their cell structure indicated that they died suddenly by freezing, and the stage of their arrested development showed that the freezing took place in early June.</p>
        <p>The fossils were preserved in 65-million-year-old clay sediments near Teapot Dome, Wyo. They included leaves of aquatic plants like the pond lily and lotus. Their structural deformation, Dr. Wolfe said, "can be duplicated experimentally in extant aquatic leaves by freezing."</p>
        <p>In the current issue of Nature, Dr. Wolfe reported other evidence indicating that the "impact winter" produced at least one to two months of darkness. The loss of sunlight caused temperatures around the world to drop from an average of 66 degrees Fahrenheit to a low of 14. Lakes froze and thousands of species of plants died. The landscape at Teapot Dome was denuded of vegetation, except for ferns.</p>
        <p>When the clouds of debris broke, the researcher said, dust and gases in the atmosphere produced a greenhouse effect, allowing sunlight in but trapping the Earth's heat.</p>
        <p>"The impact winter, although significant in the Northern Hemisphere, may have had less effect on the land biota than did the following, long-lasting wet greenhouse," Dr. Wolfe concluded.  SCIENCE WATCH</p>
