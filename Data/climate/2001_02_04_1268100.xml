        <p>TOO many comedians are making fun of George W. Bush's brainpower without any basis for their jibes. Why not give him a little quiz instead? O.K., Mr. President, which of the following would help the economy most?</p>
        <p>* A big tax cut skewed toward the rich.</p>
        <p>* Opening sensitive federal lands to logging and drilling.</p>
        <p>* Campaign finance reform that would curtail the role of money in politics.</p>
        <p>You don't have to be an economist to know the answer. Campaign finance reform is one of the most important things the government can do to improve the long-run economic performance of the United States.</p>
        <p>Reducing the influence of money in politics isn't usually considered an economic issue, but it is by far the best of the three choices. Most economists, after all, are justly skeptical of a huge tax cut as a timely economic stimulant, and sacrificing the environment for more cheap oil won't seem like such a good idea when the greenhouse effect turns Wilkes-Barre, Pa., into oceanfront  property.</p>
        <p>But just imagine how effectively the economy would hum along if not burdened by the dead weight of the subsidies, tax breaks and market-impeding regulations that arise from the legal influence-peddling known as campaign fund-raising.</p>
        <p>Consider how much better off we would be if American agriculture were freed of the market orders and price supports that the government has piled on over the years to the detriment of competitors and consumers. Or how much more sensible (and less costly) the tort system would be if lawyers could not speak as loudly as they do with their wallets.</p>
        <p>Another economic benefit of true campaign finance reform would be a simpler tax code, without so many special breaks for the wealthy. Not only might this make investment decisions more rational, but it could save some of the $125 billion a year that it costs for all American taxpayers to comply with the current arcane rules. That figure is from the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, which estimates that the 4.3 billion hours consumed annually by this miserable task is  equivalent to the labor of more than two million people. ''The performance of the economy is dramatically affected by the state of tax law,'' the foundation says.</p>
        <p>But why stop at campaign finance reform? Many other things could be done to bolster the economy without even mentioning a tax cut or consulting Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman.</p>
        <p>For one, we could spend more on science. There is strong evidence that research spending -- and having more scientists -- leads to greater economic productivity. Over all, federal research-and-development expenditures are just $83 billion a year. That may sound like a lot, but it is less than a single year's revenue at I.B.M. The budget of the National Institutes of Health is less than 1 percent of total federal outlays.</p>
        <p>Speaking of health, how about some kind of national health insurance? Our wasteful and inequitable system is a major drag on the economy, while leaving more than 40 million Americans with no medical insurance at all, according to the Census Bureau. Sooner or later, we will have to embrace some combination of single-buyer purchasing of drugs, market competition and mandatory coverage to keep medical costs from seriously retarding growth. Why not get it over with?</p>
        <p>Goading Americans to save more would help, too. Taxing consumption instead of income would encourage earning and investing, and we should reconsider the multiple taxes now levied on income. Corporations pay taxes on their profits, while we pay taxes on the ensuing dividends and capital gains.</p>
        <p>The rich want us to change that, but in return we should sharply limit the deductibility of home mortgage interest, which, as constituted, benefits mainly them. This deduction is responsible for America's gross overinvestment in housing; if people did not have a huge tax incentive to buy giant homes (which they are often too busy to spend any time in), their capital might find its way instead into new plant and equipment that could increase productivity and national wealth.</p>
        <p>FINALLY, in the category of ''pin the externality on the donkey,'' why not discourage dangerous cars by making sure that owners of sport utility vehicles somehow pay for the pollution and highway carnage they cause? After all, the lives we save may be economically productive ones.</p>
        <p>And Mr. President, there is a bonus. Adopt any of these measures, and maybe, just maybe, the late-night comics will ease up a little. At least the economists won't be laughing.</p>
