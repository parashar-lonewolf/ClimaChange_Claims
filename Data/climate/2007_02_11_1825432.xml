        <p>THE California Air Resources Board was created in 1967 with the mandate to research causes and solutions to the state's air pollution problems, evaluate and certify pollution control equipment and to take legal steps to clean up the air.</p>
        <p>Over the next 40 years, the board, an 11-member panel balanced with appointees from regional pollution-control agencies and scientists, issued stringent requirements for limiting harmful chemicals and solid particles from the exhaust pipes of trucks, cars and even lawn mowers as well as industrial smokestacks.</p>
        <p>Standards that the board, known as CARB, has established are generally regarded as the leading edge in antipollution efforts; several states have adopted California's strict policies in place of the less-stringent levels of the federal Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>Robert A. Lutz, vice chairman of General Motors, has said the exhaust of today's cleanest cars is cleaner than the air that enters the engine.</p>
        <p>But G.M. is one of several automakers that have filed lawsuits against the board, claiming it has overstepped its bounds, particularly in its recent push to reduce automotive emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas.</p>
        <p>In 2006, the California Legislature, with the approval of a former board critic, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, granted the board extraordinary powers to set policies, prepare regulations, lead enforcement efforts and levy fines and fees against violators to finance its operations.</p>
