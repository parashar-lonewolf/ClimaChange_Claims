        <p>To the Editor: I went from seeing the global warming documentary ''An Inconvenient Truth'' the night before to reading ''Being Cold Is the Hot Trend This Winter'' (In Transit, Dec. 17) the next morning. I could have been watching the part of the movie where animated ice blocks drop into a warming ocean. Unfortunately, I was reading about reality. People are actually paying to experience what is rapidly becoming extinct: freezing cold. This kind of energy waste only adds to global warming. The only thing missing from the article was a 21st-century Marie Antoinette-type saying ''Let them eat Popsicles.''</p>
