        <p>The halls of fashion are fraught with peril, and anyone who doesn't think so ought to catch a Chanel show at the Carrousel du Louvre. The mob trying to get into the auditorium may be stylishly dressed, but expensive hangtags don't equate with quality time spent working on one's deportment. Stampedes are the order of the day, and that is just among the civilians. Last year a mob of paparazzi set upon the late-arriving Nicole Kidman and nearly wiped out an entire front row.</p>
        <p>This year's presentation, held this morning, was the scene of an attack on Anna Wintour so outlandish that Robert Altman could not have scripted it. Ms. Wintour, the editor of Vogue, is well known for arriving at the appointed hour, a gesture the more punctilious because it flies in the face of the general acceptance of the fact that fashion shows never start on time. As she gingerly made her way through a throng forming in the room, which was once a vault beneath the Louvre, a woman appeared out of nowhere, screaming something about animal rights and carrying a plate of something that witnesses said looked like foie gras.</p>

        <p>The halls of fashion are fraught with peril, and anyone who doesn't think so ought to catch a Chanel show at the Carrousel du Louvre. The mob trying to get into the auditorium may be stylishly dressed, but expensive hangtags don't equate with quality time spent working on one's deportment. Stampedes are the order of the day, and that is just among the civilians. Last year a mob of paparazzi set upon the late-arriving Nicole Kidman and nearly wiped out an entire front row.</p>
        <p>This year's presentation, held this morning, was the scene of an attack on Anna Wintour so outlandish that Robert Altman could not have scripted it. Ms. Wintour, the editor of Vogue, is well known for arriving at the appointed hour, a gesture the more punctilious because it flies in the face of the general acceptance of the fact that fashion shows never start on time. As she gingerly made her way through a throng forming in the room, which was once a vault beneath the Louvre, a woman appeared out of nowhere, screaming something about animal rights and carrying a plate of something that witnesses said looked like foie gras.</p>
        <p>It took only about two seconds for the woman to reach Ms. Wintour and smash the plate in her face. It took somewhat longer for those around the editor to register what had just occurred. The fashion world being what it is, a certain number of people merely continued on their way to the show. The assailant, for her part, took off into the brightly lighted shopping concourse and got away. This was despite the presence of what passes for a security force.</p>
        <p>Ms. Wintour was eventually ushered backstage and helped to clean up. Then she took a seat in the auditorium, but in the relative safety of the second row. ''All in the line of duty on the fashion front lines,'' she said, evidently shaken but still grinning.</p>
        <p>''It's not the first time I've seen her,'' Ms. Wintour added, referring to the assailant. And it is not the first time the editor, who often wears fur, has been attacked, which is why she typically travels with bodyguards. ''They've been waiting all week, both here and in Milan,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Weather, let it be said, hardly ever impinges on the truly fashionable these days. The dedicatedly chic wear peignoirs in winter and pelts in summer in the belief, one assumes, that the fossil fuel that warms or else cools them exists in limitless supply.</p>
        <p>It is -- let's face facts -- a drag to have to think about global warming or contested Iraqi oil fields when checking the mirror before leaving the house. The last thing anyone wants to do is dwell on diminishing resources when dressing up. Clothing oneself is often an act of determined fantasy in these parts, or at least it is when the City of Light is not experiencing one of the snowiest winters in memory.</p>
        <p>Freezing weather and unusual levels of nightly snowfall characterized the last week and made for some equally unusual moments in the disused 19th-century markets, Balzac-era stables and medieval dungeons where designers often choose to exhibit their clothes. Backstage at the so-called Espace Éphémère Tuileries, a huge tent erected in the gardens alongside the Louvre, models for the Dior, Celine and Chloé shows blew on hands so stiff with cold that they could barely hold lighter to cigarette.</p>
        <p>At the Yohji Yamamoto show on Monday, a handful of space heaters feebly fought off the arctic chill in an area where farmers used to sell turnips back when people still took their main nourishment from food. At Ann Demeulemeester's show on Thursday, held in the same structure, there was the extraordinary sight of editors huddled together like extras from D.W. Griffith's ''Orphans of the Storm'' as snow drifted through the glass rooftop and into the space.</p>
        <p>The short story writer Grace Paley once titled a collection ''Enormous Changes at the Last Minute,'' a phrase that seems particularly apposite during Fashion Week. The lacquered surface of most fashion shows barely hints at the frenzy that goes on until the last possible second. On the evening before Alexander McQueen's latest presentation his atelier was as antic as a hive with the lid yanked off.</p>
        <p>British cutters knelt on the floor scissoring paper patterns. Italian seamstresses, imported for the occasion from the Gucci factory outside Milan, furiously stitched dresses to mold perfectly onto the forms of Estonian models built like 13-year-old boys. French beadworkers sewing crystal bugles onto sweaters pressed anyone (Mr. McQueen's licensing agent, for instance) into service who could hold a needle. Production assistants made sure the right fluted pencil skirt was matched with the correct crocodile stiletto. And Mr. McQueen wandered, oddly calm, through it all.</p>
        <p>''I've been doing this too long for nerves,'' he explained.</p>
        <p>A lot will be written in the days to come about the ideas brought to his latest collection by Mr. McQueen, one of the most gifted designers at work. Tippi Hedren, in all her pathological icebox splendor, will be mentioned. So will Marilyn Monroe.</p>
        <p>But the true inspiration behind Mr. McQueen's latest collection -- sexier and less complex than the molded leather busts and full skirts he showed in an elaborately staged chess game last year -- is a sex symbol obscure to anyone but the designer: his Aunt Renee.</p>
        <p>It was this aunt who paid Mr. McQueen's way through design school. It was she who gave him his earliest ideas about how women want to look. ''It's all about sex, isn't it, fashion?'' he said. ''I love the idea of a mature woman moving really well in a dress.''</p>
        <p>His Aunt Renee, he said, ''knows how to move, and she's still really sexy at nearly 70 years old.''</p>
