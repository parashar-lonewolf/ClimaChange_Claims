        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Finally Feeling the Heat,'' by Gregg Easterbrook (Op-Ed, May 24):</p>
        <p>So Mr. Easterbrook has finally decided to switch sides regarding global warming, ''from skeptic to convert.'' Well it's about time!</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding his claims to the contrary, clear evidence of climate change has been around for at least the past two decades. Unfortunately, self-styled ''environmental commentators'' like Mr. Easterbrook, who have publicly voiced skepticism about global warming, have succeeded in providing cover for polluters and their political allies who have resisted taking long-overdue action to address the issue.</p>
        <p>If the United States had begun grappling with climate change 20 years ago, the solutions would have been far easier and far cheaper, and recent climate-induced catastrophes such as Hurricane Katrina might have been avoided.</p>
        <p>Ken Bossong  Takoma Park, Md., May 24, 2006</p>
        <p>The writer is coordinator, Sun Day Campaign.</p>
