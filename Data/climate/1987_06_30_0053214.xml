        <p>It was the heady sense of being first, of living where no one had lived before, that drew early settlers like Kathleen and Udayan Gupta to Battery Park City, a 90-acre experiment at the mouth of the Hudson and the tip of Manhattan. Built on landfill from the construction site of the World Trade Center, this new community brimmed with promise, and the Guptas found a home there within easy reach of work, a spectacular view and a sense of peace and privacy they had never known in New York.</p>
        <p>What they did not find was a supermarket, bookstore or pharmacy.</p>
        <p>Four years later, the area is growing at a breathtaking rate, and residents no longer wonder where their next amenity is coming from. In 11 high-rise apartment buildings beside a still-unfinished complex of offices and stores, the 5,000 inhabitants of this city-within-a-city are struggling with dual desires that have long confronted other frontier settlers - rural and urban alike: the wish to expand and develop and the wish to remain the same.</p>
        <p>Battery Park City has changed dramatically since the first residents of the first apartment building, at Gateway Plaza, were forced to buy food from one store in the area - a dry cleaner that had temporarily gone into the milk and bread business.</p>
        <p>Now there is a supermarket, optometrist and bank. There is David's Cookies and Au Bon Pain. Two new cleaners have opened, and the competition has driven down the cost of cleaning and starching a shirt.</p>
        <p>Nine apartment complexes are complete, and 85 percent of the units have been sold or rented, according to the Battery Park City Authority. The prices in the three rental buildings range from $1,100 a month to more than $1,500 for a one-bedroom apartment. In the condominiums, a one-bedroom unit sells for between $150,000 and $250,000.</p>
        <p>Next year, 75 shops and restaurants are to open in 220,000 square feet of retail space throughout the four-tower World Financial Center, and residents will, for the first time, be a stone's throw from the things many New Yorkers demand from their neighborhood - gourmet coffee, fashionable stores and a place to go for dinner.</p>
        <p>As with many of her neighbors, Mrs. Gupta said she hoped the additions would not tilt the balance in the wrong direction by destroying the isolation she cherishes.</p>
        <p>''I don't think the change is going to be as drastic as some people fear it's going to be,'' she said. ''But I hope that while we get more services, we can still retain some of our privacy.'' Planning for 4 Ferries</p>
        <p>These days, most of the griping concerns not what the neighborhood lacks, but what it is about to receive.</p>
        <p>The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey wants to put in four 630-passenger ferryboats connecting the city to Hoboken, N.J., and allowing thousands of people to travel by boat to lower Manhattan.</p>
        <p>New York City says the ferry would relieve the congestion on the PATH trains and give New Jersey commuters a break. Residents of Battery Park City say the ferry would bring unwanted people trooping through their backyard at the rate of 9,000 an hour.</p>
        <p>The Gateway Plaza Tenants' Association has been meeting with representatives from the city and the Battery Park City Authority to look into what can be done. But at this point, it appears that the ferry is inevitable. The question now is where the terminal will be built, in the residential or the commercial area.</p>
        <p>''We recognize there is a need for an additional means of transportation, and we understand that this is a public area,'' said Norman Kleiman, a member of the tenants' group, which has taken the lead in opposing the ferry. ''But if you have all these people going through the residential neighborhood and the parks and the playground, you're going to destroy its character.</p>
        <p>''I live here partly because it is so nice living and walking next to the water. And I'll have to see what happens after they put this in.'' Advocates for Children</p>
        <p>In the beginning, there was no need to have a group called the Battery Park Parents' Association.</p>
        <p>In fact, there were eight children in the entire Gateway Plaza complex when the president of the association, Lois Eida, moved there in 1983.</p>
        <p>Now there are at least 150 youngsters, with more coming all the time, according to Mrs. Eida, who keeps a list. This year, the first day-care center in the area, Joy McCormack's All-Day Nursery, opened. And it is all Ms. McCormack can do to keep enough Mr. Potato Head toys on hand to satisfy her growing clientele.</p>
        <p>The children are deposited and claimed by mothers and fathers with briefcases, and in the evenings, they are taken to a new playground called Pumpkin Park, built in response to highly effective parental clamoring. Parents say the area is safe and clean and easy - perfect for little children.</p>
        <p>But the children are getting older, and the parents worry that the city will not be able to accommodate them. Plans are under way for new playing fields and other sports areas in the northern end of the city.</p>
        <p>But the fears are that they will not be built fast enough and that the present pattern - families' moving out when the children become teen-agers - will hold true.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Eida, who wants Battery Park City to be a neighborhood of families, as well as of young professionals, said, ''I worry that because of a lack of facilities, we'll keep losing the kids when they get older.'' Setting a Tone</p>
        <p>Slipping out early from work next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Jim Towers grabbed some lunch and wandered over to the Battery Park City Esplanade by the water, where the Worldwide Jazz Band was playing.</p>
        <p>It was a fine day for music. The air was warm and the sky was clear, and the Hudson, green and murky as it is, sparkled beguilingly. The Statue of Liberty looked small and splendid off to the left.</p>
        <p>Mr. Towers, stood in front of the band, tapping his feet, humming along, applauding the solos like a true afficionado. ''They're great, aren't they?'' he said.</p>
        <p>The jazz band, part of a weekly concert series this summer, was hired by the Battery Park City Authority to draw the residents together and, at the same time, to welcome outsiders. Through this and other arts and events, the authority hopes to give the neighborhood a nudge, to help the experiment become a community.</p>
        <p>There were hundreds of people in various stages of relaxation. Business people from the World Trade Center and other nearby offices doffed their ties. Residents, flouting reports of erosion in the ozone layer, slathered on greasy lotion. Construction workers without shirts reclined and ate sandwiches.</p>
        <p>Chomping on a cigar and squeezing the arm of his friend, Rosemarie Commisso, Frank D'Angelo said he remembered the esplanade when it was not the esplanade at all, but water punctuated by deteriorating piers.</p>
        <p>''I've been delivering mail here for 30 years,'' he said, recalling the United Fruit Company, whose loading dock used to be at Pier 3.</p>
        <p>The group was playing one of Mr. D'Angelo's favorites - ''It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)'' - and he began to sing. ''What?'' Ms. Commisso asked.  ''You know who sings that? Ella Fitzgerald,'' he said, spinning her around. And he looked dreamily down the esplanade, at the water, at all the people.</p>
        <p>''This is what New York is all about,'' Mr. D'Angelo said, ''if you leave here, you're going nowhere.''</p>
        <p>Nearby, an executive on a bench removed his shoes, put on his sunglasses, and tossed his newspaper into the trash.</p>
