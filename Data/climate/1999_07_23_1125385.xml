        <p>HOW green is your Volvo? Its manufacturer is happy to tell you, in its recently published Environmental Product Declaration, a cradle-to-grave look at the pollution generated by the manufacturing, use and eventual dismantling of its S80 luxury sedan.</p>
        <p>''It's our judgment that consumers have a right to this kind of information,'' said Hans-Olov Olsson, president and chief executive of Volvo Cars of North America. ''It lets people know about the environmental processes that are ongoing within the company.''</p>
        <p>Some of Volvo's categories are familiar, like exhaust emissions (the company gives itself various scores from 9 to 90 percent, depending on pollutant) and parts recyclability (50 to 100 percent). But the product declaration also looks at a process not often discussed -- the actual manufacturing of the car in Torslanda, Sweden -- and it admits there is room for improvement.</p>
        <p>Although Volvo has made big gains in cleaning up emissions from the paint shop, generally the dirtiest part of any car plant (Volvo gave itself a 91 percent score), and has little material waste (86 percent), it scolds itself for using too much energy to build the S80 (46 percent).</p>
        <p>No other auto company offers such a holistic look at the environmental impact of its operations, but all of them care about the image they project. So they promote everything from air-conditioning refrigerants free of chlorofluorocarbons to brake pedals made from recycled tires.</p>
        <p>It is not surprising, then, that there was an outcry from the car makers that scored poorly in the environmental ratings of 56 United States car plants by the Council on Economic Priorities, a nonprofit research institution in New York that advocates what it calls responsible corporate behavior. Mitsubishi came in last of eight manufacturers in the council's reckoning, with Honda next to last. The top scorer in the weighted ratings was DaimlerChrysler, followed, in descending order, by General Motors, BMW, Ford, Nissan and Toyota.</p>
        <p>Honda was particularly wounded, since it plans to introduce soon the Insight, a very clean, fuel-efficient hybrid-power car, and its president, Nobuhiko Kawamoto, said last year that the company was willing to put ''everything on the table'' to fight global warming and reduce greenhouse gases. Mitsubishi offers several cars with excellent fuel economy, and it recently successfully negotiated an end to a long-running boycott organized by the Rainforest Action Network over the company's forestry operations. It saw the bad publicity as not only unfair, but also particularly ill-timed.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the mood was more sanguine at DaimlerChrysler, the top-scoring company. James A. Carlson, director of pollution prevention and remediation, said that the results were ''a positive acknowledgment that we've been pro-active in dealing with plant environmental issues.''</p>
        <p>Both Honda and Mitsubishi questioned the process by which the Council on Economic Priorities had scored the companies. Only 70 percent of the score was derived from the companies' actual environmental performance; 10 percent was based on an evaluation of their annual environmental reports. (Only Nissan failed to publish one.) The other 20 percent came from a ranking of environmental management systems. Honda and Mitsubishi were penalized for failing to return the council's detailed questionnaire.</p>
        <p>''We fundamentally disagree with C.E.P.'s conclusions, which are, frankly, unsupportable,'' said Roger Lambert, senior manager of company communications for Honda. ''They said they downgraded us because we didn't complete their survey form, but we shared with them extensive information that showed that even as our plants in Marysville and East Liberty, Ohio, were increasing production by 30 percent from 1994 to 1997, they were also decreasing per-unit chemical emissions by 71 percent.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lambert said that starting in 1990, Honda was an ''aggressive'' participant in an Environmental Protection Agency program to reduce emissions of 33 chemicals by 50 percent over five years. The East Liberty plant, he said, was the first in the nation to switch to cleaner water-based paint, in 1989, and was the first to use returnable containers for parts delivery. Honda also pioneered the salvage of auto-body stamping scrap for use in brake and engine parts.</p>
        <p>At the Council on Economic Priorities, Romi Gottfrid, an environmental research associate who was a principal author of the report, disagreed with Honda about the data the company provided. ''They sent us nothing,'' she said. ''We didn't even get the glossy public relations handouts.''</p>
        <p>Mitsubishi accused the council of misreading toxic-emissions data that manufacturers report annually. A spokeswoman, Gael O'Brien, said: ''Mitsubishi performs all functions such as stamping, welding, painting and assembly in one facility, while most other auto makers have separate sites for these operations. And those other facilities report their emissions separately.'' She added that the council had failed to give the company full credit for recycling. ''Less than 6 percent of the emissions we generate are actually released,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Judged solely on its generation of pollutants, as measured by 1996 toxic-emissions data, the Mitsubishi plant in Normal, Ill., is unquestionably the nation's dirtiest, producing 21.6 pounds of toxic chemicals per vehicle. But E.P.A. data indicate that Mitsubishi has an 85 percent recycling and recovery rate. And the agency offers caveats about drawing conclusions from raw data.</p>
        <p>In response to Mitsubishi's complaints, Ms. Gottfrid said the council stressed reducing pollution at the source. In response to a letter from Mitsubishi, the council said, ''Controlling pollution is the old way of looking at the problem, versus the new way, which is pollution prevention.''</p>
        <p>If reports like the Council on Economic Priorities' are a stick to goad corporations into building cleaner plants, the voluntary principles outlined by another group, the Council for Environmentally Responsible Economies, are a carrot to move them forward gently. Among auto companies, only General Motors is a signatory, but corporations outside the industry, including Polaroid and the Body Shop, have signed on. The nonspecific principles call on manufacturers to, among other things, ''reduce and where possible eliminate waste through source reduction and recycling.''</p>
        <p>Does the public care about dirty auto plants? The 1999 edition of ''The Green Guide to Cars and Trucks'' by John DeCicco and Martin Thomas (American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, $8.95) notes, ''Most of the environmental impact associated with motor vehicles occurs when they are used.'' Manufacturing accounts for 9 percent of the energy eventually used by a typical car, the book says.</p>
        <p>The Council on Economic Priorities has tried to bring plant emissions to the forefront by enlisting a public relations firm and providing bulk copies of postcards that are pre-addressed to the president of Mitsubishi Motor Manufacturing, Michino Yamashita. ''Your Normal facility yields four times the toxic emissions of the best auto manufacturer in the U.S.A.,'' the cards say.</p>
        <p>Bad publicity hurts, but do cleaner companies benefit from high scores? ''Consumers aren't yet demanding environmentally friendly products, and they're definitely not prepared to pay for them,'' Mr. Olsson of Volvo acknowledged.</p>
