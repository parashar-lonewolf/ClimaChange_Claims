        <p>IT is no secret why President Clinton opted for a B.T.U. tax over alternative energy levies: The idea is to raise maximum revenue gain with minimum political pain.</p>
        <p>But his proposal to tax the heat content of fuels is generating a lot of grousing among environmentalists and economists. While none of their complaints sound like deal-breakers, they will certainly figure in the push and shove of the Congressional lawmaking.</p>
        <p>Ask any environmentalist for his favorite energy tax and you will hear an earful about carbon. "It is better to tax 'bads' than 'goods,' " argues Robert Repetto of the World Resources Institute -- and in this case, the "bad" is carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels that are warming the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>But a tax on carbon is anathema to the coal industry because coal releases about twice as much carbon per unit of energy generated as oil or natural gas. And President Clinton plainly does not want to go to war with the coal lobby's friend in high places, Robert Byrd, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.</p>
        <p>Economists are not as easy to pin down, but a goodly number are drawn to an oil or a gasoline tax. Oil, after all, is the primary source of urban air pollution -- a less overarching "bad," perhaps, than global warming, but a more tangible one.</p>
        <p>Add to that the fact that roughly half of America's oil is imported. So any tax that reduces consumption would come in part from the pockets of the sheiks and the ayatollahs: "Even a modest reduction in imports," suggests Morris Adelman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, "could disrupt the oil cartel."</p>
        <p>The catch, from the White House's perspective, is that oil, too, has an effective domestic lobby. Probably as important, an oil or gasoline tax would have a disproportionately large impact on a handful of states, and would thus be politically divisive at a time when the President can ill-afford defections from the Democratic ranks.</p>
        <p>This explains why an "ad valorum" sales tax -- a simple percentage levy on the market prices of all fuels -- was the smart-money choice in the weeks before the Clinton plan was announced. Like a B.T.U. tax, this tax would spread the pain. But Philip Verleger, a fellow at the Institute for International Economics, points to some subtle drawbacks.</p>
        <p>The tax would vary in proportion to market prices, adding to the volatility of costs to consumers. This does not bother Mr. Adelman, who has long been partial to a tax that would effectively beat OPEC to the punch in crises, skimming a portion of the inevitable windfall for the Treasury. But it upsets politicians, who are loath to pile misery upon misery when energy prices go up.</p>
        <p>Then, too, an ad valorum tax would cost families more than corporations because businesses generally buy their fuel at wholesale rates. This may not be a bad thing: In competitive markets, lower business costs are generally passed through to consumers. But try selling that idea to middle-class Americans, who spent the 1980's waiting in vain for the trickle down.</p>
        <p>That leaves the B.T.U. tax -- or rather the Clinton version, which has been modified to tax oil and hydropower more heavily than natural gas or coal in order to level the regional impact. It would do the job, raising $22 billion in 1996. And a classic study by Bruce Hannon and colleagues at the University of Illinois suggests that once the indirect effects on product prices are taken into account, it would hit all income groups equally.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Verleger still sees problems. In some cases, he notes, it takes a lot of energy to make energy. Western coal, for example, which must be transported thousands of miles to market on diesel-powered trains, would face a major competitive disadvantage with respect to Appalachian coal. Heavy California oil, which must be forced out of wells with very hot steam, would be at a disadvantage compared with lighter domestic grades and all foreign oil.</p>
        <p>Then there is enforcement. Mr. Clinton proposes to soften the blow on residential consumers by excluding heating oil from the tax in the first year. But heating oil is nearly identical to diesel and jet fuels, and monitoring compliance would not be easy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Verleger's tax of choice is a hybrid, a combination of a very modest sales tax on all fuels plus a 15-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline. This tax would come even closer than the Administration's tax to the ideal of regional neutrality. It would be relatively easy to enforce. And it would eliminate the competitive disadvantages to digging coal in the West and lifting heavy grades of oil.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Verleger is quick to concede that his best could become the enemy of the good. "If it becomes a choice of a flawed B.T.U. tax or no energy tax," he said, "I'll take the B.T.U. tax."</p>
