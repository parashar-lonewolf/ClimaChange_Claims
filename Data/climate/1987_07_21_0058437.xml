        <p>LEAD: SCIENTISTS are devising a new class of flying machines, powered by beams of pure energy.</p>
        <p>SCIENTISTS are devising a new class of flying machines, powered by beams of pure energy.</p>
        <p>An experimental airplane fueled by microwaves transmitted from earth will take off in Canada this summer; in theory, it could stay aloft for months. By the next century, spacecraft could routinely rise to orbit on engines powered by energy beams, lifting large payloads at a tiny fraction of the current cost.</p>
        <p>The general aim is to eliminate the need for on-board fuels, which limit flight time, lifting power, payload capacity and overall efficiency of airplanes and spacecraft.</p>
        <p>Far from new, the idea of beaming energy was first explored in the 19th century by Heinrich Hertz, the German physics pioneer, and Nikola Tesla, the eccentric genius whose electrical experiments shocked and delighted Thomas Edison, John Jacob Astor and Mark Twain.</p>
        <p>The ideas of Hertz and Tesla have now come of age, scientists say, paving the way for a new era of innovative transport.</p>
        <p>''Much of this will be commonplace in the 21st century,'' said William C. Brown, a researcher at the Raytheon Corporation who works with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration on the design of beam-powered vehicles for use in space.</p>
        <p>Applications are expected to abound. Canadian researchers plan to launch the beam-powered airplane, which has a wingspan of 15 feet, in the next few weeks. Their ultimate goal is the creation of inexpensive platforms for communications relay that could substitute for communications satellites.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, NASA is planning a robot plane with a 150-foot wingspan that could circle for months to monitor potentially dangerous gases high in the earth's atmosphere.</p>
        <p>NASA researchers also want to beam energy from an orbiting mother ship to power-hungry rover vehicles on the surface of Mars.</p>
        <p>And researchers at Rennselaer Polytechnic Institute are designing a small beam-powered spaceship that could rapidly carry five people into earth orbit.</p>
        <p>''It's easy because there's no fuel,'' said Leik N. Myrabo, an engineering physicist at R.P.I., in Troy, N.Y. ''The vehicle weighs six tons, about the same as a 35-foot Winnebago. You could throw in the family dog and be orbiting in three to four minutes.''</p>
        <p>The allure of beam energy is illustrated by the inefficiencies of the space shuttle. At liftoff, regular fuel for its main engines and booster rockets makes up about 85 percent of its total weight. If the shuttle could somehow get that fuel on a microwave beam, its payload capacity would jump from 30 tons to nearly 2,000.</p>
        <p>Power beaming is akin to radio operation, except that it works with higher power levels. A transmitter sends out radio frequency waves, and a distant antenna and receiver pick them up and turn them into usable energy, usually electricity.</p>
        <p>The first serious work on power beaming was done by Tesla in 1899 at Colorado Springs. With a $30,000 grant from Colonel Astor, he built a huge coil in a building topped by a 200-foot antenna. Historians have no idea whether the reclusive Tesla had much success, or over what distances his wireless power transmission was meant to work.</p>
        <p>Power beaming became more feasible after World War II with the advent of microwave transmission, in which very short radio waves can be focused into narrow beams rather than spreading out in all directions. The West's Shift in Emphasis</p>
        <p>Government agencies, including NASA and the Department of Energy, intensively studied beaming microwave power during the energy crisis of the 1970's, in hopes of creating a system in which huge orbiting satellites would turn sunlight into microwaves for conversion into electricty on earth. That idea, now under study by the Soviet Union, was dropped in the West, largely because of its expected high cost.</p>
        <p>Today's Western efforts focus on generating microwave beams on earth for powering all kinds of flying vehicles. The Canadian Government, for instance, sponsors a research program known as SHARP, for Stationary High-Altitude Relay Platform. The platform, a pilotless airplane, is to be powered by microwaves beamed from an earth-based field of magnetrons - or microwave generators - similar to those in a microwave oven. Antennae below the drone's wings will pick up the energy and turn it into direct current for an electric motor and propeller.</p>
        <p>''Sometime this summer we expect to demonstrate that a microwave-powered airplane can be built and flown,'' said Dr. Ronald E. Barrington, director of radar and communications technology at the Canadian Government's Communications Research Center in Ottawa.</p>
        <p>''We think that microwave-powered aircraft would be an excellent relay platform for radio communications, like a low-flying communications satellite,'' he continued. ''It gives you coverage on the earth's surface of an area with a 600-kilometer radius. The other application is as a mount for radar to monitor fisheries on the coast, where vessels are, and see whether they're in the wrong zone.'' Environmental Concerns</p>
        <p>He said an operational craft could stay up for about half a year.</p>
        <p>''Technically, economically, it looks very promising,'' he said. ''The part that worries me is public concern about microwaves,'' which have been cited as health and environmental hazards.</p>
        <p>In the 1970's, that concern surrounded the issue of solar-power satellites. But Dr. Barrington said operational power levels in his project's aircraft would be too low to do any harm. ''We feel the system can be made quite safe,'' he said. ''But in many of these types of new science, the mystery of it all affects people more than the facts.''</p>
        <p>In the United States, researchers assessing the energy potential of microwaves include those at Lockheed-Georgia, a division of the Lockheed Corporation. They are designing a large pilotless airplane for enviromental monitoring in a study for NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. Lockheed researchers say a ground-based antenna array measuring 100 yards by 100 yards would transmit microwave energy to a drone equipped with a 40-horsepower electric motor. The drone would fly in a figure-eight pattern at a height of 12 miles, close to the edge of space.</p>
        <p>''That's about twice as high as commercial jets and way above what you can do with a tethered balloon,'' said Donald Bouquet, head of the project at Lockheed. Staying aloft for about 90 days, the drone could carry up to 150 pounds of sensing equipment to gather continuous data on the carbon dioxide buildup in the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>''We see no technology roadblocks at all,'' he said, adding that it would be much cheaper to build than an orbiting scientific satellite. ''The cost of a couple of airplanes and a ground system would be about $30 million.'' NASA has made no final decision on whether to go ahead and build such a system. Spacecraft for Mars</p>
        <p>A space-based application of power beaming is on the drawing boards at NASA's Lewis Research Center in Cleveland. Scientists there envision a Mars mission in which a mother ship orbiting the planet would transmit microwave beams to power a remote-controlled drone.</p>
        <p>''One proposal is for an airplane with a big wingspan,'' said Jose L. Christian Jr. ''It would work with regular propellers'' in the thin Martian atmosphere, ''sort of like flying at 100,000 feet on earth. It could fly around, set down and unload a rover to explore the surface and collect samples. We figure it could cover about 40 percent of the planet's surface without refueling.'' The Lewis center has proposed an eight-year, $60 million development program that would culminate with test flights in the Martian atmosphere before the turn of the century.</p>
        <p>For use closer to earth, Dr. Brown, of the Raytheon Corporation, is designing a spacecraft powered by microwave beams transmitted from the ground. It would travel exclusively from low earth orbit, a hundred or so miles up, to the point, 22,300 miles high, where satellites are stationary in relation to the earth. The spacecraft would use electric-powered thrusters.</p>
        <p>''It turns out that the only practical place for beaming up power to those spacecraft is on the equator,'' Dr. Brown said, noting that otherwise the craft would too often be out of reach of ground-based power transmitters. ''Transmitters would be located there, and every time the ship comes over you'd give it a shot of power'' until it reached orbit more than 20,000 miles high.</p>
        <p>Because of its electric engines, Dr. Brown's craft could work only in the void of space, having little leverage in the earth's atmosphere. But other American researchers are designing microwave-powered spaceships that could start on the ground and fly into space. The Project at R.P.I.  The Apollo Lightcraft Project - under design by Dr. Myrabo, of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, with support of NASA's Lewis center and a NASA think tank, the University Space Research Association - would be an all-purpose manned craft. Its engines would at first use microwaves to heat air, which would be fired out the back of the ship to produce thrust.</p>
        <p>''With microwaves, you can climb through the clouds to about 40,000 feet,'' Dr. Myrabo said. ''But to get into orbit, you have to switch to power beaming with lasers, which have greater power density.'' Also, once the craft left the atmosphere, it would need some form of on-board material to fire out the back to produce thrust. But Dr. Myrabo said this ''fuel'' would amount to only 6 to 9 percent of the craft's overall weight.</p>
        <p>Richard M. Dickinson, a research engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., who has worked on microwave power beaming for more than a decade, said he was optimistic about the technology but uncertain about prospects for rapid large-scale development in space.</p>
        <p>''The big problem is the capital investment,'' he said. ''The technology is definitely there. The technology exists. But to do it on a commercial scale that would be a viable enterprise is the problem, even for ground-based beaming to orbit.''</p>
        <p>He said this would probably not come to pass until near-earth space had been intensively developed with conventional chemical rockets early in the next century. ''The costs and environmental impact of hauling and burning all those chemical fuels will encourage investment in power beaming,'' he said. ''It will start to look very attractive.''</p>
