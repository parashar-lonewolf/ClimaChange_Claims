        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>David Leonhardt's review of Brian Doherty's ''Radicals for Capitalism'' ( April 1) was very economical with the truth, claiming that the Cato Institute is ''struggling to persuade people that global warming -- the archetypal free-market failure -- is a hoax.''</p>
        <p>In fact, the climatologist Pat Michaels, a scholar at Cato and at the University of Virginia, acknowledges that the earth is warming and that human activity is partly responsible, but he maintains the warming is almost certainly not going to be as disastrous as has been argued by some.</p>
        <p>Leonhardts insinuation that libertarianism is partially to blame for the disaster in Iraq is bizarre, especially coming from a journalist who works for a newspaper that helped ready public opinion for the invasion. President Bush's ''free-market approach to rebuilding Iraq has proven disastrous,'' the reviewer claims. Here at Cato we are bemused that bombing, invading and occupying countries that don't threaten us could be described as a free-market approach. Certainly nothing undertaken by Paul Bremer after the invasion could be construed as free-market either.</p>
        <p>Cato scholars, like most American libertarians, opposed the invasion of Iraq, that reckless ideological joint venture between neoconservatives and liberal hawks. In 2004, The New Republic magazine noted: ''As early as December 2001, Cato Institute scholars were writing op-eds urging the administration not to go to war against Saddam Hussein; when it did, Cato was one of the first think tanks to warn that lack of postwar planning would doom the reconstuction effort.''</p>
