        <p>President Bush began a six-day trip through Latin America intended to show support for strapped democracies today, telling Brazil's Congress that it is time "to end the false distinctions between the first world and third world that have too long limited political and economic relations in the Americas."</p>
        <p>But even as Mr. Bush spoke of helping Latin America enjoy a "new dawn in the New World," a coup attempt in Argentina overshadowed the beginning of the trip, causing White House advisers to worry that President Bush might have to cancel his visit to Argentina. But they insisted all day that the Argentine President, Carlos Saul Menem, would bring things under control and that the trip was on.</p>
        <p>After his talks in Brazil with President Fernando Collor de Mello, Mr. Bush is scheduled to go to Uruguay, Argentina, Chile and Venezuela, before returning to Washington on Saturday night. Supercomputer Sale Approved</p>
        <p>The biggest substantive development in the day of meetings in Brazil was Mr. Bush's announcement that he would permit the sale of a high-performance supercomputer to Brazil's state aircraft company, Embraer.</p>
        <p>Critics have said that Brazil should be denied such sensitive technology because it can be used to design advanced nuclear weapons. Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger said that Brazilian officials renewed promises today to use the technology under safeguards.</p>
        <p>The computer at issue is manufactured by IBM. Information on the cost was not immediately available. Mr. Eagleburger said it was of "relatively high quality but not at the top of the line."</p>
        <p>Last week, Mr. Collor cleared away many American worries about his nation's nuclear program by agreeing with President Menem of Argentina to forego the development of nuclear weapons and to place their nuclear installations under bilateral safeguards. Technology Transfers Speeded</p>
        <p>As a result of Brazil's willingness to institute safeguards, the United States and Brazil agreed to set up a bilateral commission to speed the transfer of technology.</p>
        <p>Much of the day was taken up with the developments surrounding the coup. The Presidential spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said that it "seems likely" that the military uprising was meant to embarrass President Menem before Mr. Bush's visit.</p>
        <p>"The President wants to express his confidence in President Menem and his support for democracy in Argentina," Mr. Fitzwater said. "We intend to proceed on our original schedule."</p>
        <p>Mr. Eagleburger was asked this evening in a press briefing whether the uprising underscored the fact that even in the region's democratically elected leaderships, officers in the military still hold positions of authority and are prone to use force when they feel threatened.</p>
        <p>"It certainly demonstrates that the military, on occasion, or small portions of the military on occasion are prepared to use force, yes," he replied. But he warned reporters not to take the incident "out of perspective."</p>
        <p>"As far as we know, this is a small group of officers," he said. "My argument would be that, fundamentally, democracy in Argentina is working and that this will, when this is over, demonstrate that the roots of democracy in Argentina are fairly deep." Seeking Hemispheric Unity</p>
        <p>Despite the tensions over the Persian Gulf, President Bush decided to make this trip because he wanted to promote unity in the Western Hemisphere during a year when a great deal of attention has gone to the fledgling democracies in Eastern Europe.</p>
        <p>Speaking to the joint session of the Brazilian Congress, Mr. Bush inserted a few critical comments about the Iraqi President into his remarks.</p>
        <p>He said that he had been told by President Collor that "the brutality and aggression of Saddam Hussein" had cost Brazil $5 billion in higher oil prices "for your economy, struggling to move forward."</p>
        <p>Ronan Tito, the Senate leader, welcomed the American President by noting that "we have had a long, difficult change" moving away from "the military and authoritarian regimes which have been the scourge of our region since the Cuban Revolution." Foreign Debt Cited</p>
        <p>Mr. Tito urged Mr. Bush to renegotiate Brazil's foreign debt, which now totals $115 billion. "We are inviting our creditors to become our partners in development and growth, not our partners in poverty," he said.</p>
        <p>The lawmakers who spoke before Mr. Bush offered veiled criticisms of the Administration's "demeaning" conditions for renegotiating the region's debt and trading techonology, and about stereotypes in America about Latin America.</p>
        <p>Ricardo Fiuza, a Brazilian legislator, asked that the region not be viewed "only as debtors, as producers of drugs and exporters of immigrants," but as partners in commercial enterprises. Before traveling here, Mr. Bush had warned in a press interview that talks on Brazil's $115 billion foreign debt would not be a "central" issue.</p>
        <p>The United States is Brazil's largest trading partner, investor and creditor. Brazil is $8 billion in arrears on payment of its private debt and talks in New York have stalled. Nicholas Brady, the Treasury Secretary, discussed the debt issue with Zelia Cardoso de Mello, Brazil's economy minister. Emphasizing Free Trade</p>
        <p>"We recognize that the North American Government cannot lobby private banks," Foreign Minister Francisco Rezek said today of the debt talks. "But it is not in the interest of the creditor country that the debtor cannot recuperate its economic vitality."</p>
        <p>Another major American-Brazilian issue is trade. In June, Brazil abolished a list of prohibited imports and set a four-year schedule for reducing tariffs; it also announced plans to open up its computer industry to foreign investment and imports and agreed to discuss joining multilateral trade agreements that regulate services, investment and intellectual property.  In return, the United States dropped Brazil from a watch list of major trading violators.</p>
        <p>In his public addresses to Brazilian legislators and businessmen, Mr. Bush advocated his plan to create a hemispheric free-trade zone from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego.</p>
        <p>Known as the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative, the plan calls for free trade, easier access of foreign investments and reduction of Latin American countries' debts to the United States Government.</p>
        <p>American officials have also expressed concern that deforestation in the Amazon contributes to a global warming process known as the greenhouse effect.</p>
        <p>Brazil has ended Government subsidies that encouraged ranchers to cut down the rain forest and started a campaign against using fire to clear forest. In return, Brazil wants the United States to cut carbon dioxide emissions and to give financial aid for Amazon conservation projects.</p>
        <p>The last American Presidential visit was in 1982, when Ronald Reagan offended many Brazilians with a dinner toast in which he referred to Brazil as Bolivia.</p>
        <p>The reception for Mr. Bush was oddly subdued. No crowds lined the street. The modernistic chamber of the Brazilian Senate was only partly filled and many seats on the main floor and in the balcony were empty.</p>
