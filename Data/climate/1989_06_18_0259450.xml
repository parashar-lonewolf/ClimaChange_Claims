        <p>THE FIRST RUMBLINGS of momentous change in the Adirondack Park were heard in 1985 when a New Jersey millionaire named Roger Jakubowski, who had made a fortune selling fast-food at the seashore, bought the Marjorie Merriweather Post estate north of Saranac Lake for less than a million dollars. A flamboyant fellow with a bottomless appetite for publicity, Jakubowski courted the press, telling reporters far and wide that Adirondack real estate was the last nickel bargain in America and that he intended to buy up the whole goshdarn park, all six million acres of it.</p>
        <p>He bought the Post property from the State of New York, to whom Mrs. Post's heirs had given it in 1974, thinking that the state would be happy to have the 207 spectacular acres, not to mention the 45 buildings designed in Gothic log-and-twig style. Gov. Hugh L. Carey had used it a few times as a sort of north woods Camp David, but Mario Cuomo avoided the place, with its grandiose salons and haunted-house decor, and so the agency in charge put it up for auction.</p>
        <p>Jakubowski went on quite a shopping spree after that, buying whole unspoiled lakes, a ski center, radio stations in Plattsburgh and Tupper Lake, and 40-acre Crab Island in Lake Champlain, which contains the graves of perhaps 150 sailors and marines killed in the War of 1812.</p>
        <p>''Where else can you buy a historic site as important as Arlington National Cemetery for 190 G's?'' Jakubowski boasted in the Albany newspapers. ''I stole it.''</p>
        <p>It turned out that state officials had been dickering in a leisurely way for the property with its absentee owner when Jakubowski bought it out from under them. Embarrassed by his utterances in the press, the state soon moved to seize Crab Island via eminent domain. It succeeded, but not without paying the Jersey hot-dog mogul $20,000 more than he had paid for it.</p>
        <p>In the last two years alone, more than 100,000 acres of Adirondack woodlands have been sold off for private subdivision and development, with more yet to go on the block. Many of these parcels enclose pristine lakes, historic canoe routes and sensitive wildlife habitats.</p>
        <p>The big sell-off is largely a result of changing economics in the timber business. Put simply, the Adirondack woodlands have more short-term dollar value as vacation property, and the pulp and paper companies have come under increasing pressure from Wall Street to maximize their short-term profits.</p>
        <p>The chief liquidators have included the pulp and paper companies, old families with large ancestral holdings, the owners of defunct summer camps and some elderly farmers.</p>
        <p>The chief buyers have been land speculators, some mavericks like Jakubowski, but also big companies with nationwide operations, including the Patten Corporation and Properties of America, outfits which carve up raw, back-country tracts into smaller lots and resell them quickly for substantial profits. All this buying and selling within the boundaries of the Adirondack Park has called into question the state's competence to manage it, and set off a hue and cry among those who fear that the wild character of the region will be permanently spoiled.</p>
        <p>The Adirondack Park is the largest park of any kind in the United States outside of Alaska. Almost three times the size of Yellowstone, it is roughly equal in size to the entire state of Vermont. It is also unique among parks, as the term is generally understood in America, because it is a patchwork of public and private lands. Only about 40 percent of it is owned by the State of New York; the other 60 percent is now available for development.</p>
        <p>One might think that New York would have a keen interest in consolidating as much land as possible within the park boundaries. Indeed, in 1986, voters passed a $1.45 billion Environmental Quality Bond Act with $250 million earmarked for land management and acquisition. But as the race to compete with private speculators has heated up, the state agencies have blundered with such elephantine maladroitness that Governor Cuomo finally stepped in to crack the whip over all concerned - his own bureaucrats as well as the land-hungry developers - to avert what environmentalists have called the greatest threat to the Adirondack Park in its 97-year history.</p>
        <p>TECHNICALLY, IT'S STILL POSSIBLE FOR ANYONE WITH enough money to buy up parcels of Adirondack land the size of small European principalities. This was best dramatized last year in an instance when 96,000 acres belonging to an old established timber company were put up for sale and ended up in the hands of a Georgia speculator named Henry A. Lassiter who had never even been to the Adirondacks: the so-called Diamond-Lassiter deal. In 1980, the Diamond International Corporation (formerly the</p>
        <p>Diamond Match Company), one of the five biggest landholders in the Adirondacks, was gobbled up in a hostile takeover by the English corporate raider Sir James Goldsmith. Sir James sold off Diamond's mills and factories. This cleared his junk-bond debt. The remaining woodlands were pure gravy, and, having no interest in tree-farming, he moved to liquidate these holdings.</p>
        <p>Thus did 96,000 acres of woodland, scattered over the northern counties, come on the market in January 1988.</p>
        <p>The state agency in charge of buying land is the Department of Environmental Conservation (D.E.C.). The D.E.C. was only interested in 66,000 acres, and of these it only wanted to buy 15,000 acres outright. What agency offices had in mind was to buy conservation easements (the development rights) on the rest.</p>
        <p>Easements were viewed as the ideal solution to a very sticky problem. Under Article XIV of New York's Constitution, any land purchased by the state within the park boundaries has to remain ''forever wild.'' This means you can never cut a single tree on it, and this is highly undesirable because active timbering has some very beneficial effects. It provides the local citizens with employment and, managed wisely, it makes a better habitat for white-tailed deer. With easements, one party holds title, while other parties can own various ''rights'' - timbering, mining, hunting, development and recreational being the major ones.</p>
        <p>Sir James would have none of this. He didn't want to hold title to this land, he wanted to dump it - the entire 96,000 acres, not just 66,000 - take the money and run. The D.E.C. half-heartedly tried to stitch together a deal using third parties - land trusts, the Nature Conservancy, other timber companies - to buy the land they didn't want, but there was one more big hangup: they had no idea how much the property was worth.</p>
        <p>''The process they use substitutes bureaucratic bean-counting for the kind of hard-nosed decisions that you want land buyers to make about special lands,'' said Rosemary Nichols, executive director of the New York Land Institute, a private land-use policy group based in Watervliet.</p>
        <p>The negotiations between Goldsmith and the State of New York dragged on. Then in September 1988 - nine months after the Diamond lands came on the market - Henry Lassiter appeared on the scene. Lassiter had reaped millions buying and selling land around freeway interchanges in Atlanta. He had seen an advertisement for the Diamond lands in a magazine. ''It sounded too good to be true,'' he said in a telephone interview. After dispatching a trusted subordinate to check things out, Lassiter bought the entire 96,000 acres, lock, stock and barrel, just as Sir James had stipulated, sight unseen, for roughly $17 million.</p>
        <p>This immediately caused a furor within the environmental community, led by the Adirondack Council, a private watchdog group. These were vital lands! Rivers officially classified as wild and scenic! Wilderness areas possibly lost forever! The uproar prompted Governor Cuomo and D.E.C. Commissioner Thomas C. Jorling to take another look.</p>
        <p>But now the state had to deal with Henry Lassiter, renowned for working 16-hour days and driving a humble Honda to work, a regular pit bull of a negotiator, it was said. For 10 weeks during the fall and early winter of last year, Lassiter negotiated with Jorling and his people. The term eminent domain was bandied about - meaning the state now considered appropriating the vast parcel - and just in case Lassiter didn't get the message, Governor Cuomo wrote a letter to the editor of The New York Times suggesting that he might directly intervene in the matter. A few days after Christmas, the (Continued on Page 30) State of New York arrived at terms with the Georgian.</p>
        <p>It was a sweet deal for Henry Lassiter. Lands that he had bought from Diamond for $177 an acre in September, he now turned around and sold to New York for an average of $195 an acre. The D.E.C. only bought 15,000 acres outright. It purchased conservation easements on an additional 40,000 acres. Lassiter owns the underlying title and is free to log it. Moreover, he retains the hunting rights on this land for up to 30 years, rights which he could lease at a profit to sporting clubs.</p>
        <p>Finally, out of the original 96,000 acres, Lassiter kept 41,000 for himself. Before the end of January, he announced plans to open a ''timber management'' office in Potsdam.</p>
        <p>GIVEN THE RATE and scale of development elsewhere in America since World War II, it is remarkable that the Adirondacks were bypassed for so long. But the postcard beauty of the region's deep blue lakes against a backdrop of rugged peaks belies a harsh and remorseless terrain. The brief growing season and thin soil make it difficult to farm beyond marginal dairying. The region's fierce black flies and deerflies are infamous. Veterans of the Revolutionary War were offered free tracts here as a reward for their service, and not a single one accepted the gift. The mountains weren't properly surveyed until 20 years after Lewis and Clark had returned from their trek to the Pacific. The very name Adirondacks - meaning ''those who eat bark'' in Mohawk - was not officially bestowed upon the region until the 1830's.</p>
        <p>It remained a true howling wilderness until nearly the beginning of the Civil War -as remote from civilization, in the public imagination as the highlands of Bhutan might seem to us today. In 1858, Ralph Waldo Emerson, James Russell Lowell and the naturalist Louis Agassiz slept under a spruce bark lean-to at the Philosophers' Camp on Follensby Pond, lending the region celebrity cachet. In 1869, a Boston clergyman named William H. H. (Adirondack) Murray published an enormously popular book titled ''Adventures in the Wilderness, or Camp Life in the Adirondacks,'' and inspired the first major stampede of tourists.</p>
        <p>The latter half of the 19th century became the Adirondacks' classic age. Think of Winslow Homer's paintings, the noble guides with drooping mustaches, the unbelievable bonanza of speckled trout. It was the age of William West Durant's ''great camps,'' the colossal log villas built for the Vanderbilts, the Whitneys, the Rockefellers, the Guggenheims, J. P. Morgan and other titans of industry and finance. And it was the age of reckless exploitation of natural resources. Clear-cutting timber was then the rule, and whole mountains were left denuded without a thought to the results. The rivers ran brown with silt. Albany was flooded repeatedly. Spark-belching locomotives started gigantic fires in the woods. The place was getting trashed.</p>
        <p>The recognition that this was basically a bad thing led to a series of acts which created the Forest Preserve, then drew an official park boundary around the mountains (since called ''the blue line'') and culminated in the ''forever wild'' clause being inserted into the state Constitution in 1894.</p>
        <p>Except for some quarrels over dam building, the Adirondacks enjoyed a 70-year period of drowsy stability. The timber companies learned to apply principles of scientific management. A steady stream of tourists came and went with the seasons. Private ownership coexisted happily with public access. Then, in 1967, a four-lane interstate highway called the Northway opened, connecting the State Thruway at Albany with Montreal. It ran along the eastern slope of the park and cut hours off the drive from New York City. In short order, large-scale ticky-tacky vacation developments began to sprout in the back country.</p>
        <p>Remember, 60 percent of the park was private land. Eighty-nine percent of the road frontage was private. Yet in 1967, there were virtually no regulations whatsoever for private land use, except for a law banning billboards and hot-air balloons. Panic set in at the highest levels, and in 1968 Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller appointed a commission to come up with some ideas for protecting the Adirondack wilderness. The committee's report led to the creation in 1971 of the Adirondack Park Agency (A.P.A.) and a set of laws regulating growth based on a master plan.</p>
        <p>Not long afterward, the A.P.A. opened an office outside of Lake Placid and met with hostility verging on open warfare on the part of local citizens, who raided the agency's headquarters at night wearing ski masks and tried to burn the building down, dumped truckloads of horse manure in the front entranceway and greeted visiting project officers with loaded rifles. It would now be necessary to obtain a permit to build just about anything, even additions to existing homes, and these were people who didn't like being told what to do with their property.</p>
        <p>The new land-use regulations were considered stringent at the time, but the agency proved to be surprisingly weak on enforcement. In the words of Robert Glennon, the current A.P.A. director, ''The act has a big head and a puny body.'' For instance, it has only two field inspectors to travel around the entire six-million-acre park and check violations, and one of them is due to retire this year. ''We have had to rely on the good faith of the folks who receive our permits,'' said Herman (Woody) Cole, chairman of the A.P.A.</p>
        <p>The Patten Corporation, with headquarters in Stamford, Vt., has been the most active raw-land speculator in the Adirondacks - and the most controversial. Over the past year, Patten has been investigated jointly by the attorneys general of five states - New York, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine - on allegations of consumer fraud. According to Rachel Kretser, an Assistant Attorney General in Albany, Patten sold tracts containing swampland - including certified wetlands -in the Adirondacks, showing the property to customers in wintertime, when it was covered with snow. It sold ''lakefront'' property so distant from the water that barely a ripple could be seen.</p>
        <p>In the Catskills, it was charged, Patten sold lots on mountainsides too steep for cement trucks to get up and pour foundations. In Maine, the corporation sold back-country lots close to the site of a proposed government ash dump without disclosing its existence to customers. It sold lots lacking septic approvals. In some cases, according to The Maine Times, Patten ran ads that read ''For Sale By Owner,'' to give potential customers the impression that the land belonged to an old farmer.</p>
        <p>This February, Patten reached a settlement with the five states that were investigating its practices. The corporation was ordered to make restitution, estimated by New York State Attorney General Robert Abrams at $6 million, to consumers ''injured by the company's deceptive sales practices''; to pay administrative costs of $500,000 to be divided among the states, and to supply potential customers with the particulars on each patch of land that was offered for sale.</p>
        <p>THE PATTEN CORPORATION is not the only player involved in developing the Adirondacks. The Finch-Pruyn paper company of Glens Falls, N.Y., is doing its own subdivision on a heretofore pristine lake. Otterbrook Timber and Wagner Woodlands are both offering tens of thousands of acres. And there are dozens of smaller, local partnerships and individuals at work selling off back-country acreage every day, including an outfit named the Forever Wild Development Corporation, in the town of Jay.</p>
        <p>Out of the $250 million designated by the voters in 1986, the D.E.C. was to get $120 million. By the beginning of 1989, the department had spent barely 3 percent of it. Spurred by the adverse publicity that followed the Diamond-Lassiter deal, the D.E.C. quickly spent another $25 million acquiring land.</p>
        <p>''If it weren't for pressure from the environmental community, I sincerely doubt if the D.E.C. would have pursued the Diamond lands,'' said Michael G. DiNunzio, director of park protection for the Adirondack Council, an environmental group. (Oddly, the D.E.C. still had $10 million left over from a bond act passed in 1972 that allotted $44 million for land acquisition. Commissioner Jorling insisted that the money would soon be ''completely obligated.'') ''They haven't sat down and said, 'These are the lands we really want,' '' said Timothy L. Barnett, director of the Adirondack Nature Conservancy. ''Really, it comes from not having a plan.''</p>
        <p>Commissioner Jorling maintained that the D.E.C. had specific plans to compete with the developers in buying land, but that he couldn't reveal them. He pointed to the map. ''It doesn't take a genius to look at the ownership patterns that currently exist and know where the state's interests are,'' he told me at his office in the Albany suburbs, with Interstate 87 roaring outside his window. ''But we don't go public with this information be-cause it would drive up the price.''</p>
        <p>When pressed to explain why the state had spent so little of the bond act funds, Jorling contended that it was obliged to act with the greatest prudence, in order not to waste the taxpayers' money. Might this then make the D.E.C. penny-wise and pound-foolish in the long run?</p>
        <p>''By being overcautious, they're losing vast tracts,'' said Richard Beamish of the Adirondack Council. ''Consider that unspent 1972 bond-act money - what could have purchased a thousand acres in the mid-70's will only buy 300 acres today. That's an outrageous waste of the taxpayers' money and a perversion of the state's mandate.''</p>
        <p>Just about everybody, including state officials who are directly involved, is critical of the bureaucracy. ''We'll never be able to compete with the private individual who drives by a property for sale, knocks on the door, sits down at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee, and walks out signing an agreement with a deposit on the table,'' said Robert H. Bathrick, the D.E.C.'s chief of land acquisition.</p>
        <p>It probably didn't help that the vital job of Deputy Commissioner for Natural Resources was left unfilled for more than a year, while Jorling himself was overwhelmed with other hot issues, such as medical waste washing up on the Long Island beaches.</p>
        <p>''I regret that it took as long as it did,'' Jorling said. ''I consider it a poor performance on my part, but we couldn't find anyone to take the job.''</p>
        <p>The state's last resort in cases where it simply can't come to terms with a property owner over a desired piece of land is eminent domain. Under New York law, the state must pay ''just compensation'' when it takes away somebody's land, and that figure is arrived at in the Court of Claims, based on what similar land is going for.</p>
        <p>''It's the greatest power the state can wield, and great power is wielded very reluctantly,'' said Jorling. It goes against the American grain, against the sanctity of private property. From a practical point of view, it has another drawback. ''The record in the D.E.C. is that we pay 200 percent more through eminent domain than through negotiated settlements,'' the commissioner maintained. ''Do you want me to use the public power to make rich people richer?''</p>
        <p>TUPPER LAKE, IN the heart of the Adirondacks, has the sad-sack look of a chronically depressed town, its main street lined by vacant storefronts, many older houses cobbled over with scrofulous asphalt siding and other building materials not found in nature, and ''for sale'' signs everywhere. An aged plywood factory stands desolately by the lakeshore, belching steam. This is the dark side of the Adirondacks, about as far from the Ralph Lauren timberland fantasy as you could get.</p>
        <p>In the McDonald's burger emporium, three retired gentlemen were talking, over coffee and cigarettes, about the state's land acquisitions -they were against it - and I asked to join them.</p>
        <p>''The state is making this a playground for millionaires,'' said the first old gent, who didn't want to give his name. The others ruefully concurred. Why they thought this was puzzling to me, and I said so.</p>
        <p>''If the state don't buy it, it remains free domain,'' a second old gent explained, and the others heartily agreed that this was so.</p>
        <p>Of course, there is no such thing as ''free domain'' in the Adirondacks, or virtually anywhere else in the modern world where human beings wear clothing, in the sense these three old gentlemen meant of land that belongs to nobody and everybody. Someone holds title to every scrap - either the government, or a corporation, or a private individual. No doubt their misunderstanding was innocent. But there is an organized lobby, largely made up of hunters, that has done a great deal to confuse the issues with a well-financed public relations program aimed at defeating the state's purchase of any more land.</p>
        <p>Traditionally, hunting clubs have leased large tracts within the park, running to the thousands of acres, from the big pulp and paper companies. The relationship has been stable and symbiotic. The hunt club leases are a good source of income for the timber companies, helping them to defray taxes. Over the years, many of these clubs have built lodges on their leased properties, some of them very fancy. Only club members are allowed to hunt on the leased land.</p>
        <p>Were the state to buy this land, these leases could be terminated. The buildings would have to come down. The public would be free to hunt on the land, and the use of motor vehicles would be severely restricted.</p>
        <p>Assemblyman John G. A. O'Neil has been a staunch supporter of the hunting lobby and its interests, and has been very active in the fight against state purchases. In partnership with State Senator John M. McHugh, a fellow Republican, O'Neil has sponsored a bill which would force the state to prepare an ''economic impact statement'' whenever it tried to buy a piece of land, adding another layer of delay to a process that is already lengthy and laborious.</p>
        <p>Clear away all the legalistic fog on this issue, and the hunters are basically interested in three things: They want to keep their hunting shacks, they want to be able to drive wherever they please, and they want to keep the general public out.</p>
        <p>MARIO CUOMO sent Henry Lassiter a clear message that the state meant to have Lassiter's land, but the whole Diamond-Lassiter deal, with its air of panic and desperation, its giveaways, its 11th-hour resolution, seems to have made a strong impression on the Governor. In his annual state of the state speech - delivered only a few days after the deal was struck -Cuomo announced a plan of action to counter the ''unbridled land speculation and unwarranted development that threaten the unique open space and wilderness character of the region.'' The Governor said that he would propose a stiff anti-speculation tax on quick turnover land sales, much like the one in Vermont, which has been highly successful in halting the rapacious subdivision of rural lands. He proposed to strengthen the hand of the Adirondack Park Agency, particularly in regard to its feeble rules on shoreline development - the result of political deals made 20 years ago. He promised to streamline the clumsy land acquisition procedures so the state could compete better in the real-estate market. Finally, he declared that he would appoint a new study commission - along the lines of the 1968 commission that gave birth to the A.P.A. - to recommend a long-term plan for the park.</p>
        <p>The new commission is supposed to report to the Governor next April. In the meantime, environmental groups have called for a temporary moratorium on large land sales. So far, Cuomo has expressed no interest in such a proposal. Right now, as we approach 1992 - the park's centennial year - there is no mechanism in place to stop the continuing wholesale land-grab.</p>
        <p>BACK IN JANUARY, I'd been skiing a stretch of the Northville to Lake Placid Trail with Ernie LaPrairie, a fifth-generation Adirondack guide on both sides of the family. His great-grandfather, Charlie Blanchard, had frozen to death out on nearby Raquette Lake. This part of the park had once been clear-cut so relentlessly that a woodpecker would have to pack his lunch just to fly over it, as the old-timers say. Now it was grown over with balsam and mixed hardwoods. But in this winter of the global warming scare, the weather was abnormally warm, and the steady drip-drip-drip of snow melting off the firs was an ominous reminder of the uncertain future.</p>
        <p>We stopped to eat some oranges at Tirrell Pond, where another ancestor, Henry LaPrairie, had run a boarding house for loggers. The young guide, son and grandson and great-grandson of those grizzled faces who gaze at us so implacably from out of the old sepia photos of camp life in the wilderness, said: ''The day might not be too far off when you climb a mountain, and look down, and all you see is rooftops.''</p>
