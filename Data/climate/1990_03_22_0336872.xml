        <p>LEAD: Senate leaders turned back another major challenge to their agreement with the White House on clean air legislation today as the Senate defeated an amendment to strengthen the ability of the Federal Government to clean up urban smog. The vote was 53 to 46. It now appears that the Senate-Administration compromise legislation, reached after a month of intense closed door negotiations, is likely be upheld by the full Senate despite strong opposition by environmentalists and their allies.</p>

        <p>LEAD: Senate leaders turned back another major challenge to their agreement with the White House on clean air legislation today as the Senate defeated an amendment to strengthen the ability of the Federal Government to clean up urban smog. The vote was 53 to 46. It now appears that the Senate-Administration compromise legislation, reached after a month of intense closed door negotiations, is likely be upheld by the full Senate despite strong opposition by environmentalists and their allies.</p>
        <p>Senate leaders turned back another major challenge to their agreement with the White House on clean air legislation today as the Senate defeated an amendment to strengthen the ability of the Federal Government to clean up urban smog. The vote was 53 to 46. It now appears that the Senate-Administration compromise legislation, reached after a month of intense closed door negotiations, is likely be upheld by the full Senate despite strong opposition by environmentalists and their allies. On Tuesday night the chamber voted down an amendment that would have broken the agreement by requiring stricter controls on pollution from automobiles.</p>
        <p>The House Energy and Commerce Committee is drafting clean air legislation but took no action today. The House and Senate measures would have to be resolved in a conference committee.</p>
        <p>One Hurdle Remains</p>
        <p>The remaining major obstacle to Senate adoption of the compromise bill is an amendment proposed by Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia. It would provide financial aid to coal miners who lose their jobs because of provisions on acid rain in the compromise bill. The amendment is being kept from the floor while an effort is made to reach an agreement on providing relief for coal miners that is acceptable to the Senate leadership and to Senator Byrd and his allies.</p>
        <p>The amendment defeated today was introduced by Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts. It would have restored a provision of the original Clean Air Act of 1970 requiring the Federal Government to impose restrictions on activities that cause pollution in states that fail to take adequate action on their own. The compromise bill would delete this provision.</p>
        <p>Proponents of the compromise said that mandatory Federal intervention had never worked and that their bill would require the states to make yearly progress against pollution.</p>
        <p>Opposed by 2 Senate Leaders</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerry's amendment would also have eliminated a provision of the compromise that would allow states to obtain a waiver of the smog reduction rules after six years if they proved too costly. In addition, the amendment would have required the reduction of pollution from smaller factories, refineries and other sources that would not be controlled under the compromise.</p>
        <p>The Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, and the Republican leader, Bob Dole, strongly opposed the Kerry amendment, saying it was not necessary for clean air and would break the agreement with the Bush Administration.</p>
        <p>Richard E. Ayres, chairman of the National Clean Air Coalition, an alliance of environmental, public health, consumer, church and labor groups, said the defeat of the amendments Tuesday and today constituted a ''tremendous loss for clean air.''</p>
