        <p>Saying the Bush administration wants to promote renewable energy, Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton led a conference here today for dozens of manufacturers of solar, wind and geothermal energy sources who want to set up shop on federal lands.</p>
        <p>''Our shared mission is both simple and noble,'' Ms. Norton said. ''We must explore ways to better capture the sun's light, the sky's winds, the land's bounty and the earth's heat to provide energy security for America's families.''</p>
        <p>The conference was the first response to President Bush's directive in the spring as part of his energy policy that the Interior and Energy Departments examine the potential to develop renewable energy on federal lands, including national parks and military installations.</p>
        <p>The president said that he hoped that some day ''renewables will be the dominant source of energy in America.''</p>
        <p>But critics said that the session today was little more than window dressing and that administration policies still favored the extractive industries, particularly oil and coal. The critics noted that the administration sought to cut federal money for research and development into renewable energy sources by 50 percent and that most of the $34 billion in tax breaks in the House energy bill, which the administration supports, would go to the oil, coal, gas and nuclear industries.</p>
        <p>The administration continues to oppose efforts, most notably the one by Senator James M. Jeffords, the Vermont independent who is chairman of the Environment Committee, to require that electric utilities generate a certain percent of their power from renewable sources.</p>
        <p>''This administration talks the talk but doesn't walk the walk when it comes to supporting renewable energy,'' Mr. Jeffords said. His bill would require utilities to generate 20 percent of their electricity with renewable fuels by 2020. Renewable energy now accounts for 2 percent of electricity sales.</p>
        <p>Ms. Norton, surrounded by energy experts from other federal agencies, made no commitment on government action and did not discuss conservation or tax credits for renewable sources, a program that many manufacturers seek. Instead, she asked the manufacturers what the problems were in developing renewable energies on federal land.</p>
        <p>That brought a flood of complaints that obtaining permits for leases was painfully slow and littered with bureaucratic hurdles.</p>
        <p>Jonathan Weisgall, a lobbyist for the MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company and the head of a trade association for the geothermal industry, said that one company had spent 21 years going through the process and that at the end the government rejected its application.</p>
        <p>He called the conference today a pep rally and said the government needed to switch its priorities and dedicate more people to help companies procure leases.</p>
        <p>''Look at your manpower allocation for oil, gas and coal,'' Mr. Weisgall said. ''Then look at the allocation for renewables. It's a joke.''</p>
        <p>John Miller, vice president of the Calpine Corporation, a geothermal developer in San Jose, Calif., said there had been no new significant geothermal development in the United States in more than 10 years.</p>
