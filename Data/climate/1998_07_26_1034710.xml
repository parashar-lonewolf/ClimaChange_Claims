        <p>MORE than 270 million visitors pass through the gates of the national parks each year -- as if every man, woman and child in the country visited at least one park a year. The number has grown more than 10 percent in the past decade, and the boom has brought chronic headaches to the National Park Service.</p>
        <p>Despite a 62 percent increase in its budget in the past 10 years, Park Service officials and outside experts say the park system still lacks the money to deal with all those visitors. The Clinton Administration has asked Congress for $1.8 billion for the Park Service for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, an increase of almost $100 million from this year. But it appears doubtful that Congress will provide that much.</p>
        <p>To be sure, it is sometimes the parks' popularity that is their undoing. At Carlsbad Caverns National Park in southeastern New Mexico, for example, where roads, buildings and parking lots lie above parts of the underground limestone caves, there is a constant threat of damage from polluted runoff, leaks in sewage lines and disruption of the natural infiltration of water.</p>
        <p>But the parks are also finding new opportunities: more freedom to charge entrance fees and use the revenues, more support from foundations and corporations, and a rising sentiment within the agency to make preservation of resources a top priority even if that means putting less emphasis on attracting ever more visitors.</p>
        <p>Indeed, more and more people are ''visiting'' the parks in a new way: as volunteer workers, whose numbers are expected to grow to more than 100,000 annually by the year 2000. They work millions of hours and save the agency tens of millions of dollars each year. At the Golden Gate National Recreation Area in San Francisco, for example, volunteers weed out unwanted plants and plant native species, teach environmental science to schoolchildren and even give interpretive tours at the Alcatraz prison.</p>
        <p>In many parks, new approaches could significantly change the visitor's experience. Under threat of litigation from conservation groups, the Park Service has drafted a proposal to ban Jet Skis and other personal watercraft from most parks. A period of public comment will follow; in any event, the rule would not take effect nationwide this summer. (At 13 locations Jet Skis would still be allowed; decisions about a dozen other lake shores and seashores have been deferred for two years.) Conservationists object to the noise and pollution, saying they disturb other visitors as well as wildlife.</p>
        <p>Within a few years, the Park Service will rip up roads and parking lots at the Grand Canyon; under a plan announced last November, a $14 million light rail line would carry up to 4,000 riders an hour to a visitor center on the South Rim, paid for in part with park entry fees. Similar initiatives are proposed at Yosemite National Park in California and at Zion National Park in southwestern Utah.</p>
        <p>Most people seem to think changes in park priorities are overdue. In a survey conducted early this year by Colorado State University, 95 percent of 590 respondents said the Park Service should limit the number of visitors if overuse is harming park resources; 92 percent said they would be willing to ride a shuttle bus to ease traffic congestion rather than drive, and 92 percent said they would be willing to make reservations to enter popular parks to reduce crowding.</p>
        <p>A majority of 54 percent also said they believed that in 25 years the national parks would be in worse condition than they are today. (The poll, commissioned by the National Parks and Conservation Association, an independent, nonprofit advocacy group, was taken by written questionnaires, and researchers said their method provided confidence of accuracy within 5 percent.)</p>
        <p>''There are all these little, incremental threats,'' said Carol Aten, a vice president of the association. ''Each one may not seem big, but over time they erode the quality of the parks. I think the American public sees that there is a downhill slide in the parks.''</p>
        <p>And senior Park Service officials have recommended that the agency retool its approach to managing natural resources in the parks.</p>
        <p>''We must shift our focus and priorities,'' said a report circulated within the agency in May.</p>
        <p>''Preservation of resources -- the core mission of the National Park Service -- is not adequately reflected in the annual budget submission to Congress,'' the report said. ''This results in insufficient funding of natural resource management, and encourages the perception that the National Park Service is primarily interested in recreational tourism in the parks.''</p>
        <p>The increasing imposition of fees has not bothered park visitors, according to the Park Service's own polling. More than 8 out of 10 visitors questioned approved of the fees, and more than 9 out of 10 said the fees would not discourage them from visiting the parks in the future. The Park Service says the fees, imposed since 1997 under a Congressionally approved experiment, are not intended to keep people away, but to provide revenues. Fee revenues in 1998 are expected to be $135 million. Previously, admission fees charged by parks were limited by law, and the money had to be sent to a special Treasury account. Now most of the money is kept by each park and used for local projects.</p>
        <p>The money has paid for improvements in campgrounds and trails at Denali National Park and Preserve in Alaska; for renovations to an environmental educational facility for children in the Everglades, and for wildlife surveys in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming.</p>
        <p>In some parks, the fees have had unanticipated benefits, such as deterring criminals. Since Glen Canyon National Recreation Area started charging fees at the Lone Rock Campground in Utah, documented cases of assault, rape, and drunken driving dropped abruptly, according to a Park Service report, as gang activity decreased and more families began visiting.</p>
        <p>The parks are also turning to other new potential sources of revenue. Parks are often used as film locations; for example, the 400-year-old fortification known as El Morro in the San Juan National Historic Site was used in ''Amistad'' to depict a slave trading market and an ambush in ''The Last of the Mohicans'' took place on a trail near the Blue Ridge Parkway. Congress is considering legislation that would allow the Park Service to charge filmmakers to shoot on park property.</p>
        <p>And corporations are making contributions for special projects; Aurora Foods, for example, which owns the Log Cabin maple syrup brand, recently pledged to contribute up to $1 million through the National Park Foundation to help pay for restorations of some of the hundreds of log cabins in the parks that need repair.</p>
        <p>Debate About Commerce</p>
        <p>In the past, ideas like these have raised objections that the parks were becoming commercialized, and both Congress and the Administration now tend to treat them gingerly.</p>
        <p>''That is a major point of discussion -- what ultimately should be the balance between direct appropriations vis-a-vis more dependence on nonappropriated money,'' said Robert Stanton, the director of the National Park Service. ''I think it is a healthy debate.''</p>
        <p>One aspect of the debate involves what kind of park concessions -- hotels, snack bars, tours and the like -- should be favored, and on what financial terms. In June, the Senate approved without dissent a bill sponsored by Senator Craig Thomas of Wyoming (a Republican who grew up near Yellowstone) that rewrites for the first time since 1965 the Federal law governing concessionaires.</p>
        <p>The bill outlines a more competitive process for selecting concessionaires, and eliminates a preference for renewing an existing contract. The goal is to increase the Park Service's cut -- which in any event has been increasing over the years from just 3.5 percent in 1992 to about 6.7 percent in 1996. The Park Service wants the average return to reach 10 percent of gross concessionaire revenues.</p>
        <p>Preserving the Back Country</p>
        <p>Most park visitors rarely stray far from the pavement or the well-blazed trails, even in huge wilderness parks. But tens of thousands of people each year do lace their boots, hoist their packs and hike into the back country, where arguably the most precious of the parks' resources lie open to them. Protecting those places from the inevitable damage is one of the most complex tasks facing the parks. One park struggling to manage how people hike and camp is Shenandoah National Park, which lies within easy driving distance of several big cities and is traversed by the well-blazed Appalachian Trail.</p>
        <p>In 1953, fewer than 9,000 people reportedly camped overnight in the park's back country. By 1967, with big campsites along the roadways overflowing, there were 34,000 back-country visits, and by 1973 the number swelled to 121,000. New regulations were imposed requiring permits, limiting the size of parties, prohibiting campfires and keeping campsites back from streams and trails, and the number of back-country campers began to drop steadily, reaching 38,000 in 1987.</p>
        <p>But the campers are still doing harm, park rangers say. That's largely because they do not really disperse into the woods; most of them use just 700 campsites, largely situated in violation of regulations, 80 percent of them obvious to passers-by, and fully a third of them stripped of all vegetation, down to the bare soil. Campers, according to park managers, do not want to go beyond the trail, out of sight of other campers, or away from scenic views.</p>
        <p>The park is developing a complex new series of regulations for back-country campers. There might be one set of rules for designated campsites, which could have pit toilets or food lockers; another for sites in areas that get frequent use, and yet another for dispersed campsites that are infrequently used. Four areas, including the heights of Old Rag Mountain, are currently closed to camping. But the plan also calls for intensive efforts to educate campers in the modern ethic: leave no trace. Workshops, hot lines, pamphlets and video programs would preach the message.</p>
        <p>Threats on a Larger Scale</p>
        <p>The ecological damage facing the parks is far broader than mere trampling by campers. The scope of it sometimes seems overwhelming. What can be done, short of reversing global warming, about the fact that the glaciers are retreating in Glacier National Park? Haze from distant cities and factories still clouds views in major parks, especially in the East, a problem that was supposed to have been addressed years ago. Even in Acadia National Park in coastal Maine, smog levels sometimes trigger health advisories warning visitors to avoid strenuous activities, such as bicycling, hiking or jogging.</p>
        <p>By other measures, too, the parks are scarred, according to the latest strategic plan of the National Park Service, issued last year. More than 300,000 acres of disturbed land in the parks, not counting abandoned roads, need to be restored to natural condition; an estimated 1.5 million acres are infested with exotic species, like the lake trout that have been discovered in Yellowstone Lake, where they threaten native cutthroat trout. And at least 123 endangered or threatened species are found in 181 park units.</p>
        <p>At many parks, cultural or historic features are as significant as natural wonders, and these, too are imperiled. Of the more than 20,000 buildings within the National Park Service, more than a quarter are in poor condition, according to Park Service officials. Of the 7,000 historic buildings, more than 600 are vacant. The Park Service believes that if it can lease some of the vacant buildings, even at low rents, tenants would contribute to the properties' upkeep.</p>
        <p>Preservation costs are growing at historic sites all around the country. At Minute Man National Historical Park in Massachusetts, for example, $7.2 million is needed to care for 29 historic structures on the road between Lexington and Concord, and the park's main priority is preserving the reminders still tangible of the shot heard 'round the world. According to a survey of parks published last year by the Natural Resources Defense Council and the National Trust for Historic Preservation, Nathaniel Hawthorne's home, the Wayside House, lacks even a fire suppression system.</p>
        <p>''Our demands of the Park Service exceed their resources,'' said Johanna Wald, director of the land program for the N.R.D.C., a co-author of the report. ''And our demands are not just expressed in the ever-increasing number of visitors, but in the legitimate expectation that they will protect the resources that the parks were put in place to preserve. It is a tragedy and a scandal that the natural, cultural and historic resources that define us continue to be at risk.''</p>
        <p>If you go</p>
        <p>Information about the National Park System is available on the Internet at www.nps.gov. The site covers individual parks as well as volunteer opportunities in the park system. Volunteers seeking to work at a specific park should call that park for information.</p>
        <p>Telephone reservations for campgrounds within the park system may be made at (800) 365-2267. The number for Yosemite National Park reservations is (800) 436-7275. Reservation lines operate from 10 A.M. to 10 P.M. Eastern time except on Christmas and New Year's Day.</p>
        <p>The National Park Service's official index, with brief details about each park unit and telephone numbers for further information, is titled ''The National Parks: Index 1997-1999.'' It is available for $6.50 (ask for stock number 024-005-01182-0) by credit card from the Government Printing Office at (202) 512-1800.</p>
        <p>The National Parks and Conservation Association, a nonprofit advocacy group based in Washington, offers information about parks on the Internet at www.npca.org.</p>
        <p>Finding a solution to Yosemite's traffic jams</p>
        <p>To climb the spectacular trail to the lip of Vernal Fall at Yosemite, you first have to get past the traffic: on peak days, there can be 6,000 vehicles in the park, most of them gridlocked in its main valley. The National Park Service has been wrestling with the growing logjam for years. But changing the way things are done at a national park is not easy.</p>
        <p>In the latest chapter at Yosemite, the Park Service plans to issue a clarification of its Yosemite Valley Implementation Plan this summer, giving the public another chance to comment on its program to reduce  pollution and overcrowding from privately owned vehicles in the park.</p>
        <p>The plan would limit the numbers of cars allowed to enter the park and require most visitors to the valley to move about on foot, on bicycles or on shuttle buses. Published last year, it has already drawn comment from thousands of admirers and critics.</p>
        <p>Among those who have not been impressed are operators of hotels and other travel-related businesses in nearby communities. Some of them are wondering whether the plan will not just cut down on the numbers of people who drive through the park, but also discourage tourists generally, including those who stay overnight outside the park and make day trips into its spectacular valley.</p>
        <p>A group organized by the Chamber of Commerce of Eastern Madera County, which borders the park, has come up with an alternative plan, which would limit the number of visitors only on the busiest summer days. They say this would spread the number of visitors more evenly throughout the year, relieving crowding and traffic in summer  without discouraging all motorists.</p>
        <p>The Park Service has not yet responded to any of the thousands of comments it has received since the new plan was made public last year. Scott Gediman, a Yosemite spokesman, said the Park Service hoped that by issuing a clarification of the plan, it can more clearly communicate its most striking goal: to better handle the traffic of about 4.5 million annual visitors to Yosemite.</p>
        <p>Eventually, the Park Service wants to remove most private vehicles from the valley, allowing only people who plan to stay in campgrounds and lodges within the park to bring in cars. Other visitors would use a transportation system linking the park to the communities just outside it. Most would park in surrounding towns and ride shuttle buses into  Yosemite Valley, which would have its own low-pollution tourmobiles, like the shuttle buses that currently link one site to another.</p>
        <p>Although a regional group of transportation planners from surrounding communities has begun to design the feeder system, the Park Service expects it might be a few years coming. In the meantime, people driving into Yosemite would, if the proposal is adopted, have to park at an interim lot inside the valley.</p>
        <p>Some whose livelihood depends on visitors to Yosemite believe a certain number of travelers are already staying away, even though the plan has not yet been put into effect.</p>
        <p>Paul Ratchford, general manager of the Tenaya Lodge, a big luxury resort two miles from the south entrance to the park, says that he suspects park management wants to reduce the number of visitors and is using the planned reduction in vehicles as a smokescreen, something the Park Service vehemently denies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ratchford, who is also a director of the Eastern Madera County Chamber of Commerce, has been pushing that group's alternative proposal, which would reduce the number of vehicles entering the park mainly on the relatively few summer days when the number of visitors is extraordinarily high. At those times, drivers visiting the park would need day-use passes, with half available by reservation and the rest handed out on a first-come, first-served basis by local hotels and businesses.</p>
        <p>Under this alternative plan, during the off-season visitors would actually be encouraged to come with lower fees, in their own cars. Summer visitors in automobiles would pay the highest entrance fees. In addition, this group recommended, the transportation system should carry tourists only during the peak season.</p>
        <p>A recent feasibility study by consultants to the regional transportation group echoes some of the suggestions. The study, by the San Francisco firm Nelson, Nygaard, finds that a regional transportation feeder system might not be cost-effective year round, but might have to be limited to the peak season, just as the Madera Chamber suggested.</p>
        <p>But many park advocates believe that the Park Service is mainly on the right course. Brian Huse, director for the Pacific region of the National Parks and Conservation Association, calls the Park Service approach very courageous.</p>
        <p>''I think a lot of people's concerns about the plan are based simply on fear of the unknown,'' he said.</p>
