        <p>President Clinton will announce a long-term effort on Thursday to help replace coal, oil, natural gas and uranium with farm products, crop wastes and trees to make things as diverse as electricity, pharmaceuticals and car fuel and forks.</p>
        <p>In an executive order, the President will set a goal of working with various industries to triple the amount of energy generated from  such products by 2010. The order,  White House officials said, will also instruct the Secretaries of Agriculture and Energy and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to write plans to coordinate research, create markets and take other steps to nurture ''renewable technologies.''</p>
        <p>The Administration also plans to develop proposals for research grants and tax credits to promote such technologies.</p>
        <p>Administration officials predict that developing more uses for agricultural products will result in $15 billion to $20 billion in additional farm income by 2010 and less use of  imported oil.</p>
        <p>''Essentially all of society in the last 100 years has been built on petroleum as the energy and raw material,'' said a participant in the effort, Dr. Robert R. Dorsch, director of biotechnology development at Du Pont.</p>
        <p>''We need to go from black gold to green gold,'' Mr. Dorsch said.</p>
        <p>Du Pont is working on an improved polyester based on natural sugars instead of petroleum, and is hoping that with Federal research money and coordination, the price of such sugars will fall.</p>
        <p>Other companies that have been working with the Government over the last nine months contend that motor fuels, solvents and electricity can be made from natural materials, known as biomass, on a cost-effective basis, with a reduction in pollution. The discussions have included major companies in agriculture, chemicals, oil, natural gas and forestry, as well as genetic engineering and other high-tech companies.</p>
        <p>''We're looking at taking things we currently just throw away, making them profitable, fighting global warming and cleaning the environment at the same time,'' said Roger Ballentine, the deputy assistant to the President for environmental initiatives.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore, who has emphasized Federal promotion of  new technology as well as environmentalism and support for farmers, said today in a telephone interview that the initiative would ''help insure that the agricultural economy is part of the new economy.''</p>
        <p>The Vice President said that the effort did not yet involve allocating  money but that some money would be redirected from other programs, mostly in the Energy and Agriculture Departments. More Federal attention could encourage use of natural materials, he said, and would be ''a very significant step forward.''</p>
        <p>Past efforts to use natural materials have been stymied in part by falling prices for oil and natural gas. But proponents of the idea say the drive to reduce pollution and technological advances in biology and materials science will help them.</p>
        <p>Biomass now accounts for about 3 percent of national energy use, including processes as simple as home heating with wood.</p>
        <p>Some agricultural processing companies expect big markets if they can make new products that have environmental benefits, at equal cost. Cargill Inc., for example, has a venture with Dow Chemical to produce polylactic acid, a polymer that can be used instead of petroleum-based products like polystyrene in insulated cups, and polyethylene in soft drink bottles. The acid can also be used for garbage bags or for clothing fibers. Unlike plastics, it breaks down completely in a compost heap.</p>
        <p>''It could be made from any kind of organic biomass,'' said Robert R. Parmelee, president of bioscience division of Cargill.</p>
        <p>Polylactic acid is now made from  sugar from corn kernels and other high-value products, but with a few technical advances it could be made from parts of the plant with lower value or none at all, like corn stalks, Mr. Parmelee said.</p>
        <p>''Over time, if you really want to make this big, then raw material costs are going to have to come down,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Government is already involved in many biomass projects, but the participants see greater potential. For example, the Energy Department contributed $1.3 million to pay for equipment at the Northern Indiana Power Company's Bailly Generating Station in Burns Harbor to mix wood chips with the coal. The result was less nitrogen oxide, which contributes to smog, less sulfur dioxide, which makes acid rain, and less carbon dioxide, which is believed to cause climate change. But the company would like to try a different system of using wood, cooking it into a gas that can be burned at very high efficiencies in a turbine, said Arthur E. Smith, Jr., the environmental officer at Nisource, which is Northern Indiana's corporate parent.</p>
