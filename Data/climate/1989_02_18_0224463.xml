        <p>LEAD: There was no talk of blue eyeliner, beaded bolero jackets, sister-in-law rivalries or marital disharmony.

        <p>There was no talk of blue eyeliner, beaded bolero jackets, sister-in-law rivalries or marital disharmony. There was, instead, debate about greenhouse gaseous reduction, tropospheric chemistry, the ozone layer, the role of minorities in the global family and the interdisciplinary interconnectedness of innovative people.</p>
        <p>The Prince of Wales left the Princess home at the palace this week and, with the American spotlight all to himself, relished the rare chance to get out of his glamorous wife's shadow and present himself as a serious man interested in serious subjects.</p>
        <p>''Diana's name never came up,'' said Bill Richardson, a Democratic Congressman from New Mexico who attended a luncheon with Prince Charles at the British Embassy today. Mr. Richardson was one of 17 lunch guests from the worlds of politics, news media, science, and public policy who were chosen both because they are in the 40-year-old Prince's generation and because they know something about his two favorite causes, the environment and urban problems.</p>
        <p>''I think the Prince is tired of all the publicity focusing on him as Di's husband,'' Mr. Richardson said. ''He wants to demonstrate that he's got a social conscience and cares about issues.''</p>
        <p>The Prince was also here to get to know the new President and Vice President, of course. He had tea with Dan and Marilyn Quayle at the Vice-Presidential residence, down the street from the British Embassy.</p>
        <p>David Beckwith, Mr. Quayle's spokesman, said Prince Charles walked from the embassy to the Victorian Vice-Presidential residence on Massachusetts Avenue, where the Quayles served him tea and ''sandwiches with the crusts cut off.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Beckwith said the Prince and the Vice President talked about East-West relations, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, the importance of the NATO alliance, and the difference in the way the generations born before and after World War II thought about the threat of war.</p>
        <p>Mr. Quayle let Prince Charles use his helipad to take off and land for the trip to Camp David to dine with the Bushes tonight, and the Prince joked that he hoped he would not be disturbing the Quayles if he came home too late. American's Accolade to Diana</p>
        <p>After attending an evening reception at the embassy honoring American students who have won scholarships to spend time at British universities, the Prince traveled by helicopter to Camp David in Maryland. Charles had a quiet dinner at Aspen Lodge with President Bush and his wife, Barbara; Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser; Henry Catto, the Ambassador-designate to Britain, and Sir Anthony Acland, the British Ambassador, and Lady Acland.</p>
        <p>This small informal meal at the Presidential retreat was a far cry from the glamorous dinner dance at the White House, choreographed by Nancy Reagan, when the royal visitors were in Washington in 1985.</p>
        <p>On that visit, the fairy tale pair swept into town with 7,000 pounds of luggage for an array of public appearances. They quickly became the toast of Washington. Separate Business Trips</p>
        <p>The Princess made another splash on her first official visit to New York two weeks ago, both for her fetching outfits at the opera and her visits to a shelter for the homeless and to see children with AIDS at a Harlem Hospital.</p>
        <p>Time magazine reported last week that British diplomats, fretting that tongues would wag about a marital rift if the Prince and Princess arrived separately only weeks apart, had been delicately suggesting that the Prince bring Diana with him. The Prince was not amused, the magazine said, and ignored the suggestions.</p>
        <p>Today, officials at the British Embassy treated the solo visits with typical British reserve. ''They do lots of business trips separately,'' said Isabelle Ratcliffe, a spokesman in the embassy press office. ''Most married couples in America don't work in the same office, do they? Well, it's the same with the Prince and Princess. They work separately, too.''</p>
        <p>The public did not get a chance to see the Prince and the three major networks provided no coverage on the first two nights of his visit. Those who had lunch with him today pronounced him charming, substantive and concerned.</p>
        <p>''The trouble is there is no role for the heir to the throne to play,'' he once said. ''You have to make it up as you go along.'' It was in part the nature of his proper role that the Prince wanted to discuss over vegetable terrine and salmon en croute at lunch today.</p>
        <p>His guests included Mayor Kurt Schmoke of Baltimore, Michael Boskin, the President's nominee to head the Council of Economic Advisers; Representative Claudine Schneider, Republican of Rhode Island; Senator Albert Gore Jr., Democrat of Tennessee; Bryant Gumbel, the co-host of NBC's ''Today'' show; Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., deputy publisher of The New York Times; Donald Graham, publisher of The Washington Post, Ralph Neas the director of the Civil Rights Leadership Conference on Civil Rights; Rhea Seddon, an astronaut who flew on the space shuttlecraft Discovery, and Jessica Mathews, the vice president of the World Resources Institute in Washington.</p>
        <p>He told the guests he wanted to push the boundaries of speaking out, given the limits of the British constitutional system, on issues like the environment, endangered wildlife and urban decay.</p>
        <p>''His remarks were all substance, no baloney,'' said Mr. Richardson, the New Mexico Congressman. ''The standards of the luncheon were far above what is normally discussed on the floor of the House and Senate.''</p>
