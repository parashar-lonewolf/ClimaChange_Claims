        <p>A new state-by-state study suggests that governments need not sacrifice environmental quality for economic well being.</p>
        <p>In fact, the report, released last week by the nonprofit Institute for Southern Studies, a social policy research and advocacy group, shows that nearly all of the states that ranked among the top dozen using the study's environmental criteria also ranked highest using its economic criteria.</p>
        <p>Similarly, nearly all of those judged lowest on environmental standards were also at the bottom economically. Most of those states were in the South.</p>
        <p>"At a policy level, the choice is really not jobs versus the environment," said Bob Hall, research director of the institute, based in Durham, N.C. "The states that do the most to protect their natural resources also wind up with the strongest economies and best jobs."</p>
        <p>While some economists applauded the study's general view that environmental and economic health could be compatible, they said that the interaction between the two was too complicated to allow for simple testing. And not all of them agreed with the economic and environmental categories used.</p>
        <p>The study found that 9 states were among the top 12 in both environmental and economic health. They were Vermont, Hawaii, New Hampshire, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Colorado, Oregon, Massachusetts and Maryland. The 10 states at the bottom in both categories were Louisiana, West Virginia, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas, South Carolina, Indiana, Kentucky and Oklahoma.</p>
        <p>The report used 20 economic indicators, including worker health and accident statistics, unemployment rates, job growth rates, income and poverty data, educational attainment and analyses of tax fairness.</p>
        <p>The 20 environmental indicators included amounts of toxic products produced or discharged per capita, energy consumption, the ratio of pollution emissions to manufacturing jobs and the percentage of the state budget spent on the environment.</p>
        <p>The study reflected what some states have already reported. In Oregon, for example, logging restrictions have not killed the timber industry, as was feared.</p>
        <p>"The real choice is between policies that produce short-term gain for the few versus long-term strategies that improve the quality of life for the many," Mr. Hall said.</p>
        <p>The report said that the South in particular had squandered natural resources in pursuit of jobs and development, only to end up with fewer high-paying jobs, higher poverty rates and, in many pockets, lowered economic prospects.</p>
        <p>The South has long tried to attract business by offering many incentives and few restrictions. The strategy worked for a time, said Paul Templet, a political scientist at Louisiana State University and former Commissioner of the state's Department of Environmental Quality.</p>
        <p>Louisiana had initial success, he said, "but then we found that personal income dropped, poverty rose, income disparity ratio rose, all as environmental indicators declined. We thought it would bring in jobs and prosperity, but it hasn't, and we are getting more and more unattractive as a place to do business."</p>
        <p>But William Kucharski, the current Commissioner of Environmental Quality, said the state's last-place ranking in the study was a result of taking particular facts -- a high concentration of chemical plants and oil refineries and a low population -- and adding them up to paint a false picture.</p>
        <p>"There is no question that we have a great deal of poverty," he said, "but that's more associated with the businesses we don't have than with the businesses we do have."</p>
        <p>Officials in Minnesota, which was near the top in both categories, said the study vindicates aggressive environmental protection.</p>
        <p>"We learned a simple fact earlier than most states, and that is that you can't trash the natural resource forever," said Chuck Williams, the Commissioner of the state's Pollution Control Agency.</p>
        <p>Some economists warned that the study did not prove that tight environmental regulation attracted economic development. Dirty air and fouled waterways might repel potential businesses, but the things that combine to make a vibrant economy are much more complicated than the study suggests, argued Roger Dower, an economist with the World Resources Institute, an organization concerned with environmental and economic issues.</p>
        <p>In addition, Paul Portney, an economist with Resources for the Future, a research group based in Washington, argued that each new dollar spent on environmental regulation was now producing less environmental benefit while adding more to the cost of doing business.</p>
        <p>Fred Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund, said the study could reduce the polarization between conservationists and industry. He cited Federal legislation on acid rain that gave industry flexibility in reducing pollution. The legislation saved some companies from having to close plants, he said.</p>
