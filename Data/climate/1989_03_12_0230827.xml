        <p>THE automotive industry accomplished a remarkable technological feat between 1975 and 1985 by nearly doubling the number of miles that cars and light trucks were able to travel on a gallon of gasoline. But now further progress is in jeopardy. At a time when oil imports are rising, domestic oil production is decreasing and environmentalists are warning of the need to curb atmospheric pollution, car makers are lobbying for relaxed fuel efficiency standards.</p>
        <p>In 1975 Congress, alarmed at the nation's vulnerability to foreign oil suppliers, mandated that car makers achieve an improved Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency, widely known as the CAFE standard. Congress required that the prevailing average of 14 miles per gallon for cars and light trucks be raised to 27.5 miles per gallon by 1985. The auto industry, through engineering innovation as well as by making smaller cars, was able to achieve the goal.</p>
        <p>Those car makers that oppose mandated mileage requirements contend that it was largely market forces in the form of high gasoline prices that led to their production of more efficient vehicles. But Clarence M. Ditlow 3d, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a Washington-based consumer advocacy group, insisted that the Government standards were ''a spectacular success'' and were responsible for two-thirds of the improvement.</p>
        <p>During the Reagan Administration, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration responded to the industry's complaints about regulation and reduced the requirement to 26 miles per gallon for the 1986, 1987 and 1988 model years and to 26.5 miles for 1989. Without new action by the agency, the standard would go back to 27.5 miles per gallon for 1990 cars, but the highway administration is considering a petition from the two biggest automakers, General Motors and Ford, for a lower standard. While the average miles per gallon of cars has continued to rise despite relaxed standards, the improvement may be reversed as larger vehicles come onto the market.</p>
        <p>General Motors and Ford contend that satisfying a demand for bigger cars will make it very difficult to meet higher efficiency standards. William Nowack, a spokesman for General Motors, said that the efficiency standards ''restrict the production of full-size cars and that makes a buyer hang on to an older, less efficient car or maybe buy a truck or van.''</p>
        <p>The Chrysler Corporation, which in the past has backed the fuel-efficiency requirements, now wants them to go no higher. ''What we do favor,'' said Albert J. Slechter, Chrysler's Government affairs director, ''is taxing gasoline to get it to a level where energy conservation will take place as a result of pricing.'' In the meantime, environmentalists argue that strict Government controls are necessary to avoid the global warming that they believe is being caused by the greenhouse effect.</p>
