        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Fighting Mobocracy in Bulgaria'' (editorial, Sept. 5) warns of ''opposition militants'' to explain unrest in Bulgaria. ''In East Europe, Police Have Gone the Way of the Police State'' (Week in Review, Sept. 2) suggests that postrevolutionary riots are a trait, long suppressed by the police state, that again rears its head.</p>
        <p>But the demonstrations, the ransacking of the party headquarters, the protests that enveloped the sacred mausoleum of Georgi Dmitrov (father of Bulgarian Communism) were not ''outbreaks of violence.'' They were directed political protests. Such is the politics of symbolism. Stone by stone, Sofia dismantles all reminders of Communist rule. Dmitrov is cremated, Stalinist architecture set afire, the illuminated red star on the party building extinguished.</p>
        <p>The attack on such symbols reflects the frustration of the Bulgarian people. They awoke from decades of Communist rule to find environmental degradation - airborne pollutants, acid rain, fallout from Chernobyl - a land once rich sterilized, food shortages and a $16 billion foreign debt. And they find that the one cure for such devastation is more hardship and greater endurance.</p>
        <p>Bulgarians, among others, have come to realize that they are not part of the first world but of the third world. It is this - not a vicious disregard for law and order - that sparks the politics of symbolism and the fires of civil unrest.</p>
