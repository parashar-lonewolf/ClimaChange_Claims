        <p>LEAD: Its proponents call it the future. Its opponents call it global baloney, ''globaloney'' for short.</p>
        <p>Its proponents call it the future. Its opponents call it global baloney, ''globaloney'' for short.</p>
        <p>Either way, what American and Soviet negotiators call ''the fifth basket'' of East-West issues is going to make its debut on the world stage when Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, meet in Moscow on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The fifth basket, cooperative efforts to deal with environmental problems, drugs, international terrorism and missile proliferation, will take its place alongside the four traditional areas on the Soviet-American agenda: arms control, human rights, bilateral relations and regional conflicts.</p>
        <p>In the transition period between President Bush's election and his assumption of office, Mr. Baker and two advisers - Dennis Ross, his policy planning director, and Robert Zoellick, Mr. Baker's counselor - began tossing around the idea of adding this fifth basket to the agenda, to deal with issues that were clearly part of what the public perceived to be threats to its security but were not yet reflected in the fixed agenda of Soviet-American ministerial meetings. Gorbachev Offered Opening</p>
        <p>Mr. Baker broached the idea with Mr. Shevardnadze at their meeting in Vienna in March. Agreement to add it to the agenda came as little surprise; at his United Nations speech last December, the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev had called not only for cooperative efforts between Moscow and Washington on arms control, but also for healing ''aggressions against nature.''</p>
        <p>Back in Washington, however, the arms controllers, Pentagon and State Department veterans of successive Administrations, were quick to dub the fifth basket ''global baloney.'' They say it only distracts the already overstretched policymakers from the real issue at hand: reducing nuclear arms.</p>
        <p>Because fifth-basket items cut across so many agencies, one Administration official said, even the smallest proposal for a joint effort with Moscow could require ''endless hours to get through the inter-agency process.''</p>
        <p>Dimitri K. Simes, a Soviet affairs expert at the Carnegie Endowment, says there were clearly some plums in the fifth basket, along with just as many rotten apples.</p>
        <p>''As long as you are talking about issues such as terrorism or missile proliferation, I think there may be some basis for cooperation,'' said Mr. Simes. He quoted a senior Soviet diplomat as saying to him: '' 'We can propose the terrorists we think should be ostracized, you can propose yours and where there is an overlap there may be some useful cooperation.' But if we are talking about environmental issues, I don't really see what the Soviets can contribute.''</p>
        <p>If the fifth basket is ever to develop, he said, ''it is going to have to focus on those issues where the Soviets are both deeply involved and have a real potential to deliver.'' 'Test the New Thinking'</p>
        <p>Proponents counter that the fifth basket may have more of a political and security logic than first appears. The strategic logic, State Department officials say, is as a tool to ''test the seriousness of Mr. Gorbachev's new thinking.''</p>
        <p>''An arms control relationship with the Soviet Union will only work in a democracy like ours if the public has trust to enter into such agreements,'' said a top State Department official. ''If we can demonstrate that the Soviets are really ready to engage in cooperative efforts to combat terrorism, missile proliferation or acid rain, that is going to rebound in a way that will create a much better public environment for getting arms control treaties ratified.''</p>
        <p>In the era of detente, the Soviet Union and the United States engaged in talks on a variety of issues outside arms control. But then they came as a push from the top down. What is intriguing about the global issues today is that they are being pushed from the bottom up.</p>
        <p>The Roosevelt Center for American Policy Studies, a Washington-based research center, recently completed a series of studies to determine public attitudes on changing perceptions of threat. It found global environmental problems, the spread of nuclear and chemical weapons, poverty in the third world and drug trafficking far and away of greater public concern than ''the spread of communism.''</p>
        <p>''People seem to be saying to us, 'What do we care about the Russians when the air we breath is killing our kids,' '' said Richard Nuccio, who helped coordinate the research at the center. ''People feel that we are organizing against the wrong threat. There is a new agenda of threats in which the Soviets are not the problem, they are part of the solution. The public is saying, 'Let's just declare victory in the cold war and move on to these other issues.' ''  WASHINGTON TALK</p>
