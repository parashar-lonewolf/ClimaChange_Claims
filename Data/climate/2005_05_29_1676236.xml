        <p>Everyone, it seems, has a stake in the ocean, as reflected in the speakers before a state panel studying whether power-generating wind turbines should be built off the coast of New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Scuba divers, homeowners, boaters, mayors, environmental advocates, wildcat energy entrepreneurs, chambers of commerce, friends of marine mammals, porch sitters, surfers and fishermen have all spoken before the panel, contributing to a slow-moving storm front of opinion.</p>
        <p>They include those who favor clean, renewable energy, saying the nation's dependence on fossil fuel comes at too great a cost; those who feel that the sea, the state's last unpopulated vista, needs to remain wild and free of human clutter; and even those who think wind turbines should be built because, unlike other power plants, they would make poor targets for terrorists.</p>
        <p>In December, Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey declared a 15-month moratorium on financing or permits for offshore wind farms until a panel could study the issue. Since then, crowds of people have spoken at four public hearings, with more to come after the panel releases its draft report, planned for the end of the year.</p>
        <p>In an unusual turn, groups that often raise concerns about the government's impact on the environment are urging the panel to proceed more quickly with wind farms, complaining that the moratorium unnecessarily hinders progress in developing emissions-free wind power.</p>
        <p>''Listen to NJPIRG and the Environmental Federation,'' said Lawrence J. Furman, a consultant in favor of wind power who addressed the nine-member panel in Manalapan last week. ''They're always saying 'No!' Today they're saying 'Yes!' Follow their recommendations. Put standards and regulations in place so we are ready to go when the moratorium expires.''</p>
        <p>There are no wind farms yet off the coast of the United States, where winds tend to be strongest. Land-based wind turbines are now in 27 states, including California, Washington and Pennsylvania. At the end of 2003, they provided 6,374 megawatts of power, enough to supply 1.6 million average American households, according to the American Wind Energy Association. Offshore windmills in Denmark now help provide 18 percent of that country's electricity needs.</p>
        <p>In 2002, Winergy, a corporation based in Shirley, on Long Island, submitted a preliminary application to the Army Corps of Engineers to put hundreds of windmills in five sites off the Jersey Shore, near Asbury Park, Great Egg Harbor, Avalon and Cape May.</p>
        <p>Two other projects for offshore wind power generation in the Atlantic are under consideration, one in Nantucket Sound, which this month received an important permit, said Mark Rodgers, a spokesman for Cape Wind Associates. His company hopes to build 130 turbines on the shoals near Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket. Last November, the Army Corps of Engineers released a relatively favorable draft environmental impact statement regarding the project, he said, although some critics of the plan have voiced strong opposition to it.</p>
        <p>The plan awaits a review by 17 state and federal agencies.</p>
        <p>''Ironically, this offshore wind -- clean, renewable energy -- proposal is undergoing a more comprehensive, tougher review than any of New England's fossil fuel power plants ever went through to get approved,'' Mr. Rodgers said.</p>
        <p>In supporting the Nantucket Sound project, Winergy said offshore wind energy can help provide jobs to communities suffering from a decline in traditional manufacturing or in the fishing industry. The company called wind plants preferable to traditional power plants, which it said release sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions that cause 30,100 deaths nationwide each year.</p>
        <p>On Long Island, after 70 public hearings and briefings, the Long Island Power Authority is negotiating a contract with FPL Energy, based in Juno Beach, Fla., to put 39 offshore windmills southeast of Jones Beach, and it has filed a permit application with the Army Corps of Engineers.</p>
        <p>Bert Cunningham, a spokesman for the authority, said a number of local environmental groups have been supportive of the project, and some recreational fishermen support it in part because the stanchions for the windmills may provide a reef environment for fish.</p>
        <p>According to the power authority's chairman, Richard M. Kessel, ''Over a 20-year period, the offshore wind park could prevent the burning of over 13.5 million barrels of fuel oil, which will eliminate millions of tons of combustion emissions from going into our region's environment.''</p>
        <p>In New Jersey last summer, 68 percent of the respondents in a survey of 300 Long Beach Island residents were in favor of using wind energy in the state, and 30 percent were undecided because they did not know enough about it, said Mike Mercurio, the owner of Island Wind Inc. in Beach Haven. His company develops land-based wind turbines and conducted the survey.</p>
        <p>Jersey Shore residents will become more familiar with windmills soon. The Atlantic County Utilities Authority plans to operate its wastewater treatment plant in part with five land-based windmills on the grounds of the plant. The windmills, along the Intracoastal Waterway in Atlantic City, are scheduled to begin running in September and will allow the authority to buy power for a flat rate for 25 years, for 7.94 cents a kilowatt-hour, 2 cents less than it paid last year, said the authority's president, Richard Dovey.</p>
        <p>Some residents addressing the state panel were not yet convinced that windmills belong at sea.</p>
        <p>Raymond D. Bogan, representing the United Boatmen of New Jersey and New York, worried about birds flying near the windmills in foggy conditions. ''They would be sliced and diced, wiped out in massive numbers,'' he said at the hearing in Manalapan.</p>
        <p>''With the mirage effect in winter, these things are going to look like monsters,'' he added. ''People may like it, but it will not be obscured. The view of it is going to be big.''</p>
        <p>But Laura Cayford of Asbury Park, who told the panel she lives two-tenths of a mile from the ocean, said, ''I often like to go and gaze on it, and I think looking at a line of windmills would be like looking at the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge,'' which she finds beautiful. ''I don't see the big deal.''</p>
        <p>Emily Rusch, an energy advocate with the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group, voiced concerns about the noise from construction of the turbines, and how that might affect whales, but suggested that the panel approach wind power with a sense of urgency.</p>
        <p>''New Jersey really has been a leader in clean energy,'' Ms. Rusch said. ''If we say no to this, that is going to have a lot of ramifications.''</p>
