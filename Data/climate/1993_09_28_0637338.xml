        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"Scientists Confront Renewed Backlash on Global Warming" (Science Times, Sept. 14) calls attention to a small group of antagonists such as Dixy Lee Ray and Richard Lindzen and representatives of the neo-conservative Cato Institute and the George C. Marshall Institute who believe the large scientific community exaggerates the potential warming due to accumulation of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Without addressing the wisdom of neo-conservative arguments, I would highlight the warming's probable course. Throughout glacial history's nearly 200,000 years, concentrations of heat-trapping gases -- carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides -- have followed closely the changes in temperature recorded in glacial ice in the Antarctic and in Greenland.</p>
        <p>The correlation continues in the contemporary world: as temperature rises, the rate of accumulation of these gases rises; as temperatures drop, so does the rate and concentrations follow the rate. There are several factors involved in determining this feedback. One of them is the rate of metabolism of organic matter on land: warming speeds the rate of decay and the rate of emission of those gases into the atmosphere. The effect is further warming.</p>
        <p>As the effects of the 30 percent increase in carbon dioxide, plus the effects of the accumulation of other heat-trapping gases, are felt as the influence of the Philippines Mount Pinatubo's dust and aerosols diminishes, there will be a rapid increase in the release of carbon from soils and an acceleration of the accumulation in the atmosphere. Such an effect has not been incorporated into the Ingovernmental Panel on Climate Change's models or other climatic warming models. If this assumption is correct, the speed of the warming will exceed the speeds currently projected by the I.P.C.C. and by the commonly used models.</p>
        <p>One may question the extremes now projected by climatological models not because they are too high, but because they may be too low. GEORGE M. WOODWELL  Dir., Woods Hole Research Center Woods Hole, Mass., Sept. 20, 1993</p>
