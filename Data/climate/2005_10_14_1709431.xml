Des McAnuff directs (2:30). Beginning Sunday, the theater will be renamed the August Wilson Theater. Virginia Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212)239-6200.</p>
        <p>'KARLA' Previews start Thursday. Opens October 23. The Grammy-winning musician Steve Earle, who starred in the political docudrama ''The Exonerated,'' takes up the issue of the death penalty once again, but this time as a playwright in this drama about Karla Faye Tucker, the first woman in Texas since the Civil War to receive the death penalty and have it carried out (1:30). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, East Village, (212)352-3101.</p>
        <p>'MANIC FLIGHT REACTION' Previews start Thursday. Opens October 30.

        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldbergesque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Ben Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>*'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'A NAKED GIRL ON THE APPIAN WAY'  Could it be that the exhaustingly prolific Richard Greenberg has been even busier than anyone suspected? This clunky farce about the limits of liberalism, directed by Doug Hughes and starring a miscast Richard Thomas and Jill Clayburgh, suggests Mr. Greenberg has been moonlighting as a gag writer for sitcoms and is now recycling his discarded one-liners (1:45). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212)719-1300. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>*'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>*'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'CRESTFALL' Taking place in a town described by one character as ''this insidious vicinity, the savage quarter, this perpetual crestfall,'' the speeding train of a play, which features three interconnected monologues spoken by a sex addict, a frigid woman and a whore, reveals a writer who loves words almost as much as he does dirty jokes and bloody faces. Since he made his first American splash with ''Howie the Rookie'' in 2001, Mark O'Rowe, who writes likes a mix of Samuel Beckett and Martin McDonagh, has grown in confidence, if not in maturity (1:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, between Park and Madison Avenues, (212)279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'CYCLING PAST THE MATTERHORN' A grating comedy-drama by Deborah Grimberg about the fractious relationship between a mother and daughter. Shirley Knight plays Esther, a needy, needling woman who discovers she's going blind just as her daughter leaves the nest. Carrie Preston is her needy, self-absorbed daughter (1:35). Harold Clurman Theater on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200.(Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)</p>
        <p>'EINSTEIN'S GIFT'  Vern Thiessen's potentially moving play about two German-Jewish Nobel winners -- the physicist Albert Einstein and the chemist Fritz Haber -- their differing conceptions of science's role and the martial use to which their work is put, is marred by unnecessary ''Odd Couple'' exchanges and a miscast Haber, but benefits from good performances by Shawn Elliott as Einstein and Melissa Friedman as Haber's wife (2:00). Acorn Theater on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200. (Andrea Stevens)</p>
        <p>* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE GREAT AMERICAN TRAILER PARK MUSICAL' A terrific cast keeps the generator running in this bright but flimsy contraption. A few of David Nehls's dozen ditties raise a hearty chuckle, like the valedictory anthem in which the show's heroines collectively vow to ''make like a nail and press on.'' But Betsy Kelso's book all but dispenses with plot, and substitutes crude cartoons for characters (2:00). Dodger Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>*'IN THE CONTINUUM' A spirited, smart and powerful portrait of two black women whose lives are suddenly upended by an H.I.V. diagnosis. Written by and starring Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter, who both possess the strong presence and confident technique to bring out the subtle force and the potent flavoring in their writing (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, between Park and Madison Avenues, (212)279-4200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE LADIES OF THE CORRIDOR' The Peccadillo Theater Company has revived this 1953 play by Dorothy Parker and Arnaud D'Usseau. A comedy set in an East Side hotel populated by widows and divorcées, it is an unyielding and coruscating portrait of women before feminism, relieved by Parker's dead-on wit. East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212)279-4200.(Honor Moore)</p>
        <p>'LATE FRAGMENT'  Matthew, a World Trade Center employee who survived Sept. 11, and Marta are a desperate couple falling out of love in Francine Volpe's often perceptive if muddled drama named after a Raymond Carver poem. Under the direction of Michael Imperioli (Christopher from ''The Sopranos'') and Zetna Fuentes, the play has a wobbly style, building tension only to diffuse it with less-than-credible moments (1:30). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212)279-4200. (Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'MARION BRIDGE'  The Canadian playwright Daniel McIvor takes a quiet, honest look at three sisters as they face their mother's death. It is well acted and well directed, if too predictable in spots (2:20). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, (212)868-4444. (Margo Jefferson)</p>
        <p>'THE MASTER BUILDER'  A revival that succeeds mainly through a fine performance by Dan Daily as the superstar architect of the title. Mr. Daily brings the character's tangle of contradictions together in a credible performance that manages to find the hidden troll in the artistic genius (2:20). Pearl Theater, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212)598-9802.(Wilborn Hampton)</p>
        <p>'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Jefferson)</p>
        <p>'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' With a storm trooper roaming the aisles and a woman in an Obi-Wan Kenobi get-up telling theatergoers to turn off their cellphones or they will be turned into ''cosmic dust,'' Charles Ross's sprint through Episodes IV through VI strives for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention, but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but everyone else will scratch their heads (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Zinoman)</p>
        <p>*'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros,'' which was directed by Orson Welles and starred Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE PAVILION' Craig Wright's play about the speedy wheels of time's winged chariot and the dreams it grinds into dust is set at a small-town high school reunion. Brian D'Arcy James aches with longing as the cad who wants a second chance. Gracefully directed by Lucie Tiberghien (2:00). Rattlestick Theater, 224 Waverly Place, at 11th Street, West Village, (212)868-4444. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>*'SIDES: THE FEAR IS REAL' This hilarious collection of sketches may send up familiar targets -- the insecure thespian, the fraudulent acting teacher, the arrogant Juilliard grad -- but since it's performed with such specificity and comic charm by actors firing on all cylinders, you won't care a whit. Written by and starring an entirely Asian-American cast, this slight but consistently entertaining satire is a primer on what not to do in an audition room (1:15). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)307-4100. (Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'SLUT'  This overamplified musical comedy about love and promiscuity among East Village friends leans heavily on obscenities to lend it a daring edge. Instead, it swamps even its brightest moments in tawdriness (2:00). American Theater of Actors, 314 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Miriam Horn)</p>
        <p>'WALKING DOWN BROADWAY' Dawn Powell's 1931 tale of young people looking for life and love in New York is packed with smart dialogue and honest emotions. It is also well directed, well acted and smartly designed (2:30). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)315-0231. (Jefferson)</p>
        <p>Off Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'BELLY OF A DRUNKEN PIANO' In this splendidly imperfect cabaret, Stewart D'Arrietta howls and growls convincingly through Tom Waits's three-decade song catalog, backed by a snappy trio. His patter and his piano playing are variable, but Mr. D'Arrietta makes a genial tour guide through Mr. Waits's wee-hours world (1:45). Huron Club at SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212)691-1555. (Rob Kendt)</p>
        <p>Long-Running Shows</p>
        <p>'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212)307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200.(Brantley)</p>
        <p>'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>*'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212)307-4100.(Van Gelder)</p>
        <p>'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>'DEDICATION, OR THE STUFF OF DREAMS' Portraying a terminally ill, rancidly rich misanthrope in Terrence McNally's play about a small-town children's theater troupe, Marian Seldes is a snappy advertisement for the time-defying benefits of a religious devotion to theater. She is, in fact, what ''Dedication'' is all about, or intends to be, anyway. Burdened with soap-opera-ish plot turns and artificially bright dialogue, this comedy of mortality never seems able to convince itself that life and art trump death and doubt. (2:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200, closing Sunday. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE GREAT AMERICAN DESERT' Garrett Ayers, who calls his latest company the TryTryAgain Theater, says this is his third attempt at staging this short play from 1961 by Joel Oppenheimer. It's fun. It's performed with spunk. It's got cowboys. Sure, it's indecipherable, but hey, it's less than an hour long (55 minutes). 78th Street Theater Lab, 236 West 78th Street, (800)838-3006, closing Sunday.( Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>*'THE INTELLIGENT DESIGN OF JENNY CHOW' In Rolin Jones's fanciful comedy, playfully directed by Jackson Gay, a lonely young woman in California embarks on an ambitious science project to help conquer her agoraphobia and trace her origins in China. Brisk, funny and engaging, the play disappoints only in its emphasis on flights of fancy over a nuanced depiction of its heroine's emotional dilemmas (2:10). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)239-6200, closing tomorrow.(Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'ONCE AROUND THE SUN' The ''sun'' of the title could be the talent and energy of the show's impressive cast: you can warm your hands on them and on the catchy music. Unfortunately, the book fails to capitalize on these strengths, instead presenting a trite fable about a young rock singer seduced by celebrity, with cardboard characters, despite the actors' best efforts to give them dimension. Still, the performances are very entertaining (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200, closing Sunday. (Anne Midgette)</p>
        <p>*'POOR THEATER' Part homage and part anatomy, the Wooster Group's warm, witty tribute to the director Jerzy Grotowski and the choreographer William Forsythe demonstrates how imitation can be not just sincere flattery but also a hopeful attempt to crawl into someone else's skin to see how it fits. As identities and their representations morph and blur, this is not always a comfortable activity, but it is often an exhilarating one (1:30). Performing Garage, 33 Wooster Street, between Broome and Grand Streets, SoHo, (212)868-4444, closing tomorrow. (Brantley)</p>

        <p>'BEFORE THE FALL' (No rating, 110 minutes, in German) Dennis Gansel's intensely beautiful film brings us inside one of Hitler's elite schools used to indoctrinate future leaders to observe the fate of a young amateur boxer and his sensitive roommate. Though somewhat overdetermined, the film is a chilling testament to the seductiveness of groupthink and the allure of imagined superiority.(Jeannette Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'BROKEN FLOWERS' (R, 105 minutes) Sweet, funny, sad and meandering, Jim Jarmusch's new film sends Bill Murray's aging Don Juan out in search of a son he never knew he had. He finds four former lovers, including Sharon Stone and Jessica Lange, and reveals once again that he is the quietest and finest comic actor working in movies today. (A.O. Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'CAPOTE' (R, 114 minutes) Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote is a tour de force of psychological insight. Following the novelist as he works on the magazine assignment that will become ''In Cold Blood,'' the film raises intriguing questions about the ethics of writing. (Scott)</p>
        <p>*'THE CONSTANT GARDENER' (R, 129 minutes) A superior thriller with a conscience, from John le Carré's novel. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'DANDELION' (No rating, 93 minutes) Mark Milgard's debut film is an affectedly glum slice of life about a depressed teenager in rural Washington State who takes the rap for his father after a hit-and-run accident. (Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>'EVERYTHING IS ILLUMINATED' (PG-13, 104 minutes) From Jonathan Safran Foer's novel, a sentimental Holocaust tale; tender and funny in places, but also thin and soft. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE' (PG-13, 114 minutes) If you must see only one demonic-possession courtroom drama this year, wait for the next one. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'FLIGHTPLAN' (PG-13, 93 minutes) To watch Jodie Foster storm through a phony airplane as a mother in search of her missing child has its very minor pleasures, but there is nothing in this thrill-free thriller to feed the head or fray the nerves. (Manohla Dargis)</p>
        <p>*'THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN' (R, 111 minutes) A sex comedy turned romantic bliss-out, with Steve Carell, in which the sound of one prophylactic snapping is just a single sweet note in the glorious symphony of love. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>*'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is both a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism (Scott)</p>
        <p>'GOING SHOPPING' (PG-13, 106 minutes) As loquacious and scatterbrained as its female characters, this Henry Jaglom film explores women's shopping habits and fantasies. Its incomplete sketches revolve around an upscale dress shop on the verge of bankruptcy. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'THE GOSPEL' (PG, 105 minutes) Set against a lively, music-filled African-American church, ''The Gospel,'' written and directed by Rob Hardy, and with many talented real-life gospel superstars blended into the large and able cast, endeavors to be a powerful tale of faith and forgiveness, but in the end fails to capture even the slightest essence of spirituality and religious belief, or to provide any real insight into its characters' conflicts, desires and motivations.(Laura Kern)</p>
        <p>'THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED' (PG, 115 minutes) A rousing, obvious re-creation of the 1913 United States Open, in which two sons of the working classes faced off in a game still dominated, on both sides of the Atlantic, by the well-born. Aims for par and makes it. (Scott)</p>
        <p>*'GRIZZLY MAN' (R, 103 minutes) Werner Herzog's bold, enthralling documentary about one man's journey into the heart of darkness (and the belly of the beast) traces the life and strange times of the self-anointed grizzly expert Timothy Treadwell. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE' (R, 97 minutes) A masterpiece of indirection and pure visceral thrills about a seemingly average American family almost undone by cataclysmic violence, David Cronenberg's latest mindblower is the feel-good, feel-bad movie of the year. With Viggo Mortensen, Maria Bello, Ed Harris and William Hurt, all excellent. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'IN HER SHOES' (PG-13, 130 yes, 130 minutes) In his newest film, Curtis Hanson (''L. A. Confidential'') wrests a richly textured story of love from a seemingly unlikely source, Jennifer Weiner's breezy best-selling fiction about two sisters -- played by Cameron Diaz and Toni Collette -- engaged in an epic battle of the heart, a fight waged mostly against each other and their own best interests.(Dargis)</p>
        <p>'JUST LIKE HEAVEN' (PG-13, 95 minutes) Reese Witherspoon's disembodied spirit haunts Mark Ruffalo in a real estate dispute that runs into a sweet romantic comedy. Surprisingly lighthearted and brisk, considering its fairly morbid premise.(Scott)</p>
        <p>'LORD OF WAR' (R, 122 minutes) A misfire of a political satire about the international gun market from Andrew Niccol, a filmmaker whose words say no, but whose overworked visual style says lock and load, baby. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'MAGNIFICENT DESOLATION: WALKING ON THE MOON 3D' (No rating, 40 minutes) Tom Hanks narrates this Imax film that tries to give moviegoers the virtual experience of being on the lunar surface. At times it comes close. (Anita Gates)</p>
        <p>*'MARCH OF THE PENGUINS' (G, 80 minutes) This sentimental but riveting documentary follows the one-year mating cycle of emperor penguins in Antarctica when they leave the ocean and march inland to breed and lay eggs. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, the film has no qualms about playing on our emotions. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'MIRRORMASK' (PG, 101 minutes) This British film, directed by Dave McKean from a screenplay by Neil Gaiman, blends live action with computer-generated animation by the Jim Henson Company into a provocative, murky surrealism. The story follows the Freudian nightmare of a 15-year-old girl whose parents work in the circus; it's strictly for cultists. (Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'OLIVER TWIST' (PG-13, 130 minutes) Roman Polanski's take on Dickens's classic emphasizes the darkness and cruelty of Victorian society. Vigorous and precise, it is a vivid reminder of the novelist's power as both a storyteller and a social critic. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'THE PRIZE WINNER OF DEFIANCE, OHIO' (PG-13, 99 minutes) Julianne Moore is radiant as Evelyn Ryan, the real-life 1950's Ohio housewife and mother of 10 who kept her family afloat on her winnings from television jingle contests. Jane Anderson wrote and directed this tribute in a wonderfully zany, off-center style. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'ROLL BOUNCE' (PG-13, 107 minutes) A drowsy comedy from Malcolm D. Lee about a handful of kids grooving and roller skating in the summer of 1978, ''Roll Bounce'' has heart and good vibes but little else to recommend it. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'SEPARATE LIES' (R, 87 minutes) A hit-and-run accident near the country house of an imperious British lawyer (magnificently played by Tom Wilkinson) leads him into an ethical labyrinth that tests his moral mettle as well as that of his wife (Emily Watson) and her lover (Rupert Everett). (Holden)</p>
        <p>'SERENITY' (PG-13, 119 minutes) It probably isn't fair to Joss Whedon's ''Serenity'' to say that this unassuming science-fiction adventure is superior in almost every respect to George Lucas's aggressively more ambitious ''Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith.'' But who cares about fair when there is fun to be had? Scene for scene, ''Serenity'' is more engaging and certainly better written and acted than any of Mr. Lucas's recent screen entertainments. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'THE SQUID AND THE WHALE' (R, 88 minutes) Mining his own childhood, Noah Baumbach has put together an unsparing, funny portrait of a family in crisis and a young man trying to figure out his parents and himself. Superbly written and acted, especially by Laura Linney and Jeff Daniels as a pair of divorcing writers. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'TIM BURTON'S CORPSE BRIDE' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A necrophiliac animation for the whole family about a melancholic boy, the girl he hopes to marry and the bodacious cadaver that accidentally comes between them. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'TOUCH THE SOUND' (No rating, 99 minutes) As Thomas Riedelsheimer's enlightening, mystical documentary follows the deaf Scottish percussionist Evelyn Glennie around the globe, it illustrates her understanding that sound is a physical sensation experienced throughout the body, as well as an auditory one. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'TWO FOR THE MONEY' (R, 122 minutes) A turgid male weepie in which Matthew McConaughey plays a former college quarterback turned sports-betting guru under the loud tutelage of Al Pacino's odds-making kingpin. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'WALLACE &amp; GROMIT: THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT' (G, 85 minutes) The stop-motion pooch and his cheese-loving master, back again at feature length. Silly and sublime. (Scott)</p>

        <p>ATMOSPHERE, BLUEPRINT, P.O.S.

Blueprint and P.O.S. also perform. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212)777-6800; $20. (Laura Sinagra)</p>
        <p>THE BRAVERY, INTERNATIONAL NOISE CONSPIRACY (Thursday) A less downcast version of neo-new-wave, the Bravery is tougher than its contemporaries like the Killers, if not always as much fun. International Noise Conspiracy plays politically minded garage rock that's been getting less political lately. 6:30 p.m., Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212)247-0200; $23.50. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>BLUES TRAVELER (Sunday) The jam-band Blues Traveler gives its fans an occasion to twirl in their tie-dyed T-shirts while the band stretches whiny songs into jams featuring John Popper's high-speed harmonica. 8 p.m., Nokia Theater Times Square, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212)307-7171; $25. (Jon Pareles)</p>
        <p>JUNIOR BROWN, ABIGAIL WASHBURN (Tuesday) Junior Brown has his own instrument: the doublenecked ''guit-steel'' allows him to play biting electric guitar leads in one verse and suave steel guitar in the next. In most of his music he's a country traditionalist, true to honky-tonk tempos and the deadpan baritone vocal style of Ernest Tubb. Every so often he lets loose a Jimi Hendrix lick. Abigail Washburn opens. 8 p.m., B.B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>CARL COX (Tomorrow) The British D.J. Carl Cox, who has been playing the big clubs since disco, plays techno and house-based mixes more eclectic than standard trance. 10 p.m., Crobar, 530 West 28th Street, Chelsea, (212)629-9000; $30. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>BLACKEST OF THE BLACK: DANZIG AND GUESTS (Monday) The stout, muscularly macabre rocker Glen Danzig and his eponymous heavy-metal band lead a lineup of similar acts: Himsa, Mortiis, Chimaira, Behemoth and the Agony Scene. 6:30 p.m., Nokia Theater Times Square, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street; ticketmaster.com or (212)307-7171; $28.50. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>DEATH CAB FOR CUTIE (Wednesday and Thursday) This decorous diarist-rock band's sound gets added alternative-rock heft on its new album, ''Plans'' (Atlantic). The melodic Australian poppers Youth Group open both nights, with the dreamy but prickly Canadian pop band the Stars joining the bill on Thursday. 6:30 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-7740; $25.50. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>DEVENDRA BANHART (Thursday) Mr. Banhart's eerie, wavery voice and stream-of-consciousness songs reach back to the childlike surrealism of some of psychedelia's most beloved oddballs: Syd Barrett and the preglam rock of Marc Bolan. 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600;$20 in advance, $25 at the door. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>DUNGEN (Tomorrow and Sunday) This Swedish band's biker-rock combines humongous riffing with whimsical jams, conjuring black-leather aggression and the pastoral wonder of the open road. 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; $15. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>THE FIERY FURNACES (Tonight) This brother-and-sister art-rock duo's music cuts melodies with carnivalesque keyboard vamps and digressive skronk. Their latest conceptual project sets to music some recorded interviews with their grandmother about her mid-20th-century travails. 9 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212)840-2824; $20. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>FOO FIGHTERS, WEEZER, HOT HOT HEAT (Tonight) Dave Grohl, the former Nirvana drummer, has been leading the energetic alt-rock Foo Fighters for a decade, proving that cocky affability goes a long way. The nerd-pop masters Weezer continue to write textbook pop melodies, but their scruffiest album, 1996's ''Pinkerton'' (Geffen) is the favorite of a fanatical cult of emo kids. The peppy rockers Hot Hot Heat open. 7 p.m., Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J., (201)935-3900; $30.50 to $42.50. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>FRANZ FERDINAND, TV ON THE RADIO (Monday) At the vanguard of the post -- post-punk trend, the poker-faced Franz Ferdinand plays herky-jerky party music. TV on the Radio tops its jittery rhythms and paranoid guitars with the haunting vocal yelps of Tunde Adebimpe and Kyp Malone. 7:30 p.m., Theater at Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue, Manhattan; (212)465-6741; $40. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>JIMMIE DALE GILMORE (Tuesday) The Texas troubadour Jimmie Dale Gilmore has been equating wistful Western expanse with the mysteries of existence for three decades.

(Pareles)</p>
        <p>KRISTIN HERSH (Sunday) The singer-songwriter, who led the mid-90's band Throwing Muses and found underground fame giving punk rock a twist of Wiccan ethereality, continues to make unflinching music about the modern female condition, among other things. 7:30 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3132; $14. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>ILL EASE (Tonight) The drummer and singer-songwriter Elizabeth Sharp, whose thin, insistent voice recalls the Velvet Underground's Mo Tucker, repeats inspired OCD chants matter-of-factly over her entrancing rattletrap grooves and her guitarist's distorted, looping riffs. 8:30 p.m., Cake Shop, 152 Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)253-0036; $7. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>JUANA MOLINA (Thursday) The reveries of the Argentine songwriter Juana Molina are built from her acoustic guitar picking, her hushed voice, melodies with the simplicity of lullabies and rustling, rippling, melting synthesizer backdrops that fill the songs with mystery. 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212)539-8770; $15. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>JASON MRAZ, RAUL MIDON (Sunday and Monday) Jason Mraz plays countrified, roots pop in the coffeehouse vein. The vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Raul Midon has contributed his talents to the work of many Latin pop superstars. He plays his own material here. 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)875-5766; $35.50. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>MY MORNING JACKET, KATHLEEN EDWARDS (Monday) With his atmospheric take on Southern rock, My Morning Jacket's Jim James conjures a fantasy of Neil Young and Lynyrd Skynyrd jamming together, stoned, in an echo chamber. The singer-songwriter Kathleen Edwards opens. 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600; $25. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>LIZ PHAIR, MATT POND (Monday and Tuesday) One of the 90's most riveting indie-rock singer-songwriters, the smart, sexually candid Liz Phair has been angling for a radio hit for a few albums now. Her new ''Somebody's Miracle'' (Capitol) is again too quirky for MTV, but too slick-sounding for indie devotees. Opener Matt Pond writes pleasing, if forgettable, pop songs. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212)777-6800; $25. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>SON VOLT, FRUIT BATS (Wednesday) Son Volt's Jay Farrar, the gruff-voiced, country-rock half of the seminal alt-country band Uncle Tupelo, has gone in a different direction from his former bandmate, Wilco's Jeff Tweedy, preferring stolid reflection to stylistic adventurism. The ruminative folk-pop band the Fruit Bats opens. 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600; $20 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>SUPERPITCHER, ADA (Wednesday) The German producer Aksel Schaufler, aka Superpitcher, can make pure electropop as well as create a mood of glitchy claustrophobia. The singer and producer Ada recorded a stripped-down Kraftwerk-style version of the neo-punk Yeah Yeah Yeah's gem ''Maps.'' 11 p.m., Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, Chinatown, (212)941-8100; $10 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>ROB THOMAS (Tuesday and Wednesday) The singer for the popular rock group Matchbox 20 is remaking himself as a pinup boy and trying his hand at hip-hop-inflected pop songs. This incarnation has yet to be as compelling as the last, though his voice still carries a convincing mainstream angst and he rides grooves with ease. 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212)496-7070; $38.50 to $78.50. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>U2, KEANE (Tonight) After 2000's thrilling ''All That You Can't Leave Behind'' (Interscope), U2's latest album, ''How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb'' (Interscope), and its ''Vertigo'' tour focus on what humans can live without: namely, intercontinental ballistic missiles and, evidently, some of U2's more shopworn live staples. Hence the resurrection of decades-old rarities like ''Electric Co.'' Keane is a piano-drums-vocals band that piles on hooky melodic flourishes. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue, Manhattan, (212)465-6741; $54.00 to $169.50. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>JOHN VANDERSLICE, PORTASTATIC (Tonight and tomorrow) A collaborator of the Mountain Goats' clever songsmith John Darnielle, Mr. Vanderslice also writes his own less clever songs.

Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)230-0236; $12. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>KELLER WILLIAMS (Tonight) The guitarist and singer Keller Williams has been working the jam-band circuit; using loop and echo effects he turns his 10-stringed guitar into a full band. His mild voice has more than a touch of James Taylor, but his fast fingers delight the kind of fan one of his songs describes as a ''Freaker by the Speaker.'' 9 p.m., Nokia Theater Times Square, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street; ticketmaster.com or (212)307-7171; $22.50. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>WACO BROTHERS BLOODSHOT REVUE (Tonight) Jon Langford of the Mekons indulges his country side even more strongly in the Waco Brothers, where he trades off lead vocals with Dean Schlabowske and ricochets between revolution and beer-soaked self-pity while letting his electric guitar blare. The Mekons' Sally Timms joins the bill. 8 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)230-0236; $14. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>YONDER MOUNTAIN STRING BAND (Thursday) Yonder Mountain String Band, from Colorado, carries a traditionalist bluegrass lineup -- banjo, guitar, mandolin and bass, with high vocal harmonies and no drums -- onto the jam-band circuit, picking its way through songs of wanderlust and thwarted love. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212)777-6800; $25. (Pareles)</p>

        <p>*ELAINE STRITCH (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday) In a courageous and successful leap into the unknown, Ms. Stritch makes her cabaret debut at 80. Dispensing with her theatrical signature numbers, she weaves 16 songs new to her repertory into a funny running monologue of her adventures in and out of show business. 8:45 p.m., Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212)744-1600; $125 tonight and tomorrow, $105 Tuesday through Thursday, through Oct. 29 (all shows sold out).

        <p>CLAUDIA ACUÑA QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow) Ms. Acuña is a compelling vocalist equally attuned to lyricism and high drama; she performs with her longtime cohort Jason Lindner on piano, as well as Omer Avital and Tony Escapa on bass and drums. 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212)242-1063; cover, $15.

Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, Jazz at Lincoln Center, (212)258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar.(Chinen)</p>

(Chinen)</p>
        <p>BILL DIXON (Tomorrow) Mr. Dixon has devoted his career to an avant-gardism more cerebral than cathartic; here his solo trumpet improvisations work in tandem with a slide show of his pen-and-ink drawings. 8 p.m., Earl Hall, Columbia University, Broadway between 116th and 120th Streets, Morningside Heights; free. (Chinen)</p>

(Chinen)</p>
        <p>*DIZZY GILLESPIE ALUMNI ALL-STARS (Tuesday through Oct. 23) Dizzy Gillespie, the trumpeter and bebop patriarch, was among the finest talent scouts in jazz; this band features some especially gifted veterans of his employ, including the saxophonists James Moody and Paquito D'Rivera, the trombonist Slide Hampton and the bassist John Lee. Roy Hargrove, a dazzling inheritor, will take the lead on trumpet and flugelhorn. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212)475-8592; cover, $35 at tables, with a $5 minimum or $20 at the bar and a one-drink minimum.

        <p>MANHATTAN TRINITY (Through Sunday) This piano trio deserves the high-minded handle; its members are the soulful pianist Cyrus Chestnut, the erudite bassist George Mraz and the clean, crisp drummer Lewis Nash. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, Jazz at Lincoln Center, (212)258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>WYNTON MARSALIS SEXTET (Tomorrow) Mr. Marsalis's strong new album, ''Live at the House of Tribes'' (Blue Note), finds the trumpeter pursuing a sanguine and purposeful looseness; he'll seek the same here, in a group with the tenor saxophonist Walter Blanding Jr., the pianist Dan Nimmer, the bassist Carlos Enriquez, the drummer Ali Jackson and the guest singer Jennifer Sanon. 8 p.m., Prudential Hall, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888)466-5722; $20 to $56.(Chinen)</p>
        <p>PAT MARTINO (Wednesday through Oct. 22) A dazzlingly proficient guitarist, Mr. Martino favors a brand of aggressive postbop that has more than a little in common with the blistering fusion of his youth. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212)581-3080; cover, $40, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen)</p>
        <p>EIVIND OPSVIK OVERSEAS (Sunday) On his new album, ''Overseas II'' (Fresh Sound New Talent), the Norwegian bassist Eivind Opsvik plumbs a strikingly modern (and yes, vaguely Nordic) brand of fusion; his partners here are the tenor saxophonist Tony Malaby, the keyboardist Jacob Sacks and the drummer Jeff Davis. 10 p.m., Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue, at Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)218-6934; no cover. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>JEROME SABBAGH QUARTET (Tuesday) With ''North'' (Fresh Sound New Talent), Mr. Sabbagh proves himself a quietly commanding tenor saxophonist and composer in the postmodern mainstream; his sleek ensemble sound owes a lot to the guitar playing of Ben Monder. 9 and 10:30 p.m., Koze Lounge, 676 Fifth Avenue, at 20th Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)832-8282; cover, $7. (Chinen)</p>

Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, Jazz at Lincoln Center, (212)258-9595; $135. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>DR. LONNIE SMITH TRIO (Tonight and tomorrow) Under Dr. Smith's command, the Hammond B-3 organ can be subtly atmospheric or growlingly ecstatic; together with the guitarist Peter Bernstein and the drummer Alison Miller, Dr. Smith delivers a searching brand of soul-jazz. 9 and 11 p.m. and 12:30 a.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212)864-6662; cover, $25.

(Chinen)</p>
        <p>BEN WALTZER TRIO (Thursday) Mr. Waltzer, the pianist, manages a thoughtful modernism that coexists more than peaceably with a buoyant, unselfconscious sense of swing; his trio, with Matt Penman and Gerald Cleaver on bass and drums, is first-rate. 8 and 9:45 p.m., Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, Manhattan, (212)885-7119; no cover, $10 minimum.

        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>'AIDA' (Tonight, Tuesday) The Aida of the rich-voiced soprano Michèle Crider and the Amneris of the formidable mezzo-soprano Dolora Zajick are sure bets. What fans of ''Aida'' will be curious about when Sonja Frisell's production returns to the Metropolitan Opera is the Radames of the tenor Salvatore Licitra, who has yet to live up to the promise of his dramatic Met debut in 2002 as a last-minute replacement for Luciano Pavarotti. James Conlon conducts. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000, $26 to $205.(Anthony Tommasini)</p>
        <p>'ARIANE ET BARBE-BLEUE' (Tonight, Sunday) Paul Dukas's mysterious 1907 opera tells the legend of the fearsome Duke Bluebeard and his strangely disappearing wives from a woman's point of view. In its day the work was mentioned along with Debussy's ''Pelléas et Mélisande'' as a prime achievement of the post-Wagnerian French school. That this rich work has become a rarity is inexplicable. Thanks go to the New York City Opera for this new production, which is suitably Symbolist in look. It's too bad that the musical performance under the conductor Leon Botstein is so heavy-handed. Renate Behle brings Wagnerian intensity to the role of Ariane. Tonight at 8 and Sunday at 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500, $16 to $120. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>'IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA' (Tomorrow, Thursday) Hugh Russell, by all accounts a sweet-voiced baritone, makes his debut with the New York City Opera in the title role of Rossini's perennial favorite, joining Jennifer Rivera (as Rosina) and John Tessier (as Almaviva). Joseph Rescigno conducts. Tomorrow night at 8, Thursday night at 7:30, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500, $16 to $120. (Anne Midgette)</p>
        <p>'LA BOHÈME' (Tomorrow, Sunday) Pity a small opera company: it receives critical attention only when it does something unusual, yet its audiences tend to like the same fare as everyone else. Which is to say that ''La Bohème'' at the 204-seat Dicapo Opera Theater will receive few reviews, but remains a crowd favorite. Tomorrow night at 8, Sunday afternoon at 4, Dicapo Opera, 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212)288-9438, $47.50.(Midgette)</p>
        <p>'CARMEN' (Tomorrow) Though she missed her scheduled company debut because of illness, Milena Kitic is set to sing the role as planned this weekend. Ruth Ann Swenson is singing her first Micaëlas, prettily; Marco Berti is loud but untender as Don José; and Philippe Jordan brings a crisp touch as he tries to hold it all together from the pit. 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Remaining tickets: $220. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>'LA CENERENTOLA' (Monday, Thursday) Olga Borodina's mezzo-soprano is slightly dark for the title role in Rossini's Cinderella story, but she has the clarity and agility to bring this virtuosic, richly ornamental music to life. The rest of the cast -- including Barry Banks as the Prince, Simone Alberghini as Dandini and Simone Alaimo as Don Magnifico -- is well matched in this comic-book production by Cesare Lievi. Monday at 8 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000, $26 to $220. (Allan Kozinn)</p>
        <p>'FALSTAFF' (Tomorrow, Wednesday) The attention to detail that characterizes this production is truly unusual: it's well cast, well acted and well conducted by a masterly James Levine. It also features the reigning Falstaff of our day, Bryn Terfel, who is matched note for note by the fabulous Stephanie Blythe as Mistress Quickly -- she almost steals the show. Go see it. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000, $42 to $220. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>'TOSCA' (Tomorrow) Mark Lamos's 1998 production of this Puccini favorite has returned with its crisp geometric elegance intact. Carla Thelen Hanson is a respectable Tosca, and Todd Thomas is a vocally assured, larger-than-life Scarpia. But at the opening performance last week, Jorge Antonio Pita came up short as Cavaradossi, sounding underpowered and intermittently strained. John Demain conducts. 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500, $16 to $120. (Jeremy Eichler)</p>
        <p>Classical Music</p>

(Eichler)</p>
        <p>CECILIA BARTOLI (Wednesday) This great Italian mezzo-soprano promotes her new recording, ''Opera Proibita'' (Decca), with a recital of opera and oratorio arias by Scarlatti, Caldara and Handel. Orchestra La Scintilla of the Zurich Opera supports here, and will have its moment in the sun by way of Caldara and Handel overtures and a Corelli Concerto Grosso. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800, $37 to $127. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>BEAUX-ARTS TRIO (Tonight) This group, which -- at least in the person of its venerable founding pianist, Menahem Pressler -- has just turned 50, is in its second of three seasons surveying all the piano trios, violin sonatas and cello sonatas of Beethoven. In addition, it gives the American premiere of Jan Müller-Wieland's ''Schlaflied,'' or ''Lullaby.'' 8 p.m., Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212)570-3949; $50. (James R. Oestreich)</p>

        <p>CHOIR OF ST. IGNATIUS LOYOLA (Thursday) The choir's director, Kent Tritle, who founded the church's invaluable program Sacred Music in a Sacred Space, conducts a performance of Haydn's glorious and underperformed oratorio ''The Creation.'' 8 p.m., Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, Park Avenue at 84th Street, (212)288-2520; $35 and $45; $25 for students and 65+. (Oestreich)</p>
        <p>CLEVELAND ORCHESTRA (Monday) Cleveland's conductor, Franz Welser-Möst, has been getting mixed reviews at home, but the orchestra's last stint in New York showed little reason for alarm and even included some of the loveliest Schubert heard in many moons. Composers of Mr. Welser-Möst's native Austria seem to draw from him a special affection and fluency, so it's good that he arrives next week bearing Brahms (the First Symphony and the ''Academic Festival Overture'') as well as the New York premiere of a work by Chen Yi. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800, $33 to $116. (Eichler)</p>
        <p>JUILLIARD STRING QUARTET (Thursday) The premiere of Ezequiel Viñao's String Quartet No. 2 is the centerpiece of this recital by one of this country's most venerable chamber ensembles. Included as well are Mozart's Quartet in G (K. 387) and Beethoven's Quartet in C sharp minor (Op. 131). 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)769-7406; free, but tickets are required. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>BLAIR McMILLEN and STEPHEN GOSLING (Tomorrow) ''Powerhouse Pianists'' is the title that the sponsoring American Modern Ensemble has given to this joint recital. Few people who have heard these formidable young pianists, champions of contemporary music, would quibble with the billing. Their inventive program includes works by, among others, Lee Hyla, Annie Gosfield, Conlon Nancarrow and David Rakowski. 8 p.m., Tenri Cultural Institute, 43A West 13th Street, Manhattan, (212)645-2800, $15; $10 for students and 65+.

(Midgette)</p>
        <p>NEW YORK FESTIVAL OF SONG (Wednesday) This survey features the ''singable'' (Festival's term) songs of the last quarter of the 20th century, including the work of John Musto, John Corigliano, Richard Thomas and Ricky Ian Gordon. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212)501-3330, $45; $35 for 65+. (Holland)</p>
        <p>NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Tuesday, Thursday). Marin Alsop has gotten attention lately for becoming the first woman appointed music director of a major American orchestra, receiving a MacArthur Foundation grant and working on a recorded Brahms symphony cycle. She comes to the Philharmonic with the Brahms First and Midori, who joins her in Prokofiev's first violin concerto. Beginning Thursday, Gianandrea Noseda and the pianist Simon Trpceski take on Rachmaninoff's Third. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Tuesday and Thursday nights at 7:30, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500, $26 to $94. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>PAULINE OLIVEROS and IONE (Wednesday) The Mercantile Library, which boasts a second-floor reading room of an ideally intimate size for chamber music, has joined the essential Meet the Composer organization for the concert series ''MTC at the Merc.'' These 60-minute programs also offer a chance to meet the composers and performers. Here the iconoclastic and inventive composer Pauline Oliveros, who also plays the accordion, will be joined by the playwright, poet and author Ione for a performance of ''Cross Overs,'' a musical work that explores, in the phrase of the creators, the sound of words and the making of words out of sound. 6:30 p.m., Mercantile Library, 17 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212)755-6710, $15. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>ORPHEUS CHAMBER ORCHESTRA (Tuesday) Richard Goode's pianism is always thoughtful and deeply felt, so hearing him in two concertos -- Mozart's ''Jeunehomme'' in E flat and Beethoven's Third -- is a rare treat. The program also includes overtures by J.C. Bach and Cherubini. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800, $30 to $88. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>FREDERIC RZEWSKI (Thursday) In this installment of the Miller Theater's important ''Composer Portraits'' series, the pianists Ursula Oppens and Marilyn Nonken, and the percussionists Tom Kolor and Dominic Donato explore some of Mr. Rzewski's powerful, politically charged works, including his magnificent set of piano variations on ''The People United Will Never Be Defeated.'' Included as well is the New York premiere of ''Bring Them Home,'' an antiwar piece. 8 p.m., Miller Theater, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212)854-7799, $20. (Kozinn)</p>

        <p>NEW YORK BUTOH FESTIVAL: DAISUKE YOSHIMOTO AND YUMIKO YOSHIOKA (Wednesday and Thursday) Two dances celebrate metamorphosis. ''Eros and Thanatos'' makes the naked body a landscape in flux.

        <p>ANN LIV YOUNG (Opens Wednesday) Dance joins forces with words, singing and narrative in ''Michael,'' an erotically charged dance set inside a 42-foot-long trailer decorated with Victorian floral wallpaper and prim furniture. The choreographer says her production is for mature audiences only. Wednesday through Oct. 22 at 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)924-0077 or www.dtw.org; $20; students and seniors, $12. (Anderson)</p>

        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'OBSESSIVE DRAWING,' through March 19. In the museum's first ''emerging talent'' show, one of the five artists selected is 83, lives in a home for the elderly in Pennsylvania and stopped painting two years ago because of failing eyesight. Overall, the work in the exhibition is abstract and spare, giving the problematic outsider category a new spin. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Holland Cotter)</p>
        <p>COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely techy show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'être is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400.(Grace Glueck)</p>
        <p>GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'RUSSIA!,' through Jan. 11. This survey of nine centuries of Russian art ranges from 13th-century religious icons to a smattering of 21st-century works, achieving its astounding effect without resorting to a single egg, or anything else, by Fabergé. It immerses us in two enormous, endlessly fascinating narratives: the history of painting and the history of Russia, forming a remarkable tribute to the endurance of the medium and the country, and the inescapable interconnectedness of art and life. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3600. (Roberta Smith)</p>
        <p>*JAPAN SOCIETY: 'HIROSHI SUGIMOTO: HISTORY OF HISTORY,' through Feb. 19. A very personal, whimsical exhibition by this well-known Japanese photographer, who incorporates into his work artifacts that he has collected, particularly from East Asia and Japan. Mr. Sugimoto's reach is long, and his range is broad, from fossils to textiles to undersea dioramas to Japanese calligraphy to the Trylon and Perisphere (a minisculpture) that symbolized the New York World's Fair of 1939. It may not be all that enlightening, but as an artist's personal survey, it comes off. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Glueck).</p>
        <p>*JEWISH MUSEUM: 'THE JEWISH IDENTITY PROJECT: NEW AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHY,' through Jan. 29. Who's Jewish, who isn't, and by the way, what is a Jew anyway? They are not easy questions, as this intense who-are-we exploration makes clear. Ten projects by 13 artists try to help break the stereotype of American Jews as uniformly white, middle-class and of European descent. Using photography and video, they have interpreted their missions broadly, from the Korean-born Nikki S. Lee's meticulous staging of a Jewish wedding with herself as the bride to Andrea Robbins and Max Becher's look at the thriving shtetl established by Lubavitcher Hasidic Jews in the rural community of Postville, Iowa. Refugees from the Holocaust, Jews of color, those of various sexual orientations, an extended Iranian family, a convert to Judaism reared as a Roman Catholic and others are seen and heard in this lively show, which broadens the universe of Jews in this country. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street (212)423-3200. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE BISHOP JADES,' through Feb. 12. Jade has been treasured since ancient times, though the almost preposterously exquisite objects on display in the Met's reinstalled galleries for Chinese decorative arts date from the 18th century, when the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) brought Chinese jade work to a peak of virtuosity. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'THE (S) FILES/THE SELECTED FILES 05,' through Jan. 29. The definition of what ''Latino art'' means is changing in a post-identity-politics time, and this modest biennial, drawn mostly from unsolicited proposals submitted by artists in the greater New York area, is an indicator of what that change looks like. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212)831-7272. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'NEW YORK CHANGING: DOUGLAS LEVERE REVISITS BERENICE ABBOTT'S NEW YORK,' through Nov. 13. During the 1930's, the Modernist photographer Berenice Abbott photographed the architectural fabric of New York with a keen eye for contrasts of new and old. Between 1997 and 2003, Douglas Levere returned to the scenes that she photographed and photographed them again. Seeing 50 of his paired with her originals is a fascinating education in how things change. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212)534-1672. (Ken Johnson)</p>
        <p>* STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'SCRATCH: 2004-2005 ARTISTS IN RESIDENCE: WILLIAM CORDOVA, MICHAEL QUEENLAND AND MARC ANDRE ROBINSON,' through Oct. 23 . Rap, religion, Minimalism and Malcolm X all figure in this intricate, multilayered show of work by the three young residents, organized by the museum's associate curator, Christine Y. Kim. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>*WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'OSCAR BLUEMNER: A PASSION FOR COLOR,' through Feb. 12. Not exactly a well-known name today, except to devotees of American Modernism, this German-born architect-turned-painter (1867-1938) was in fact one of the major American artists of the early 20th century, right up there with the likes of Marsden Hartley, John Marin, Arthur Dove and Charles Demuth, to name a few. Most of his compositions are unpeopled landscapes depicting houses and building fragments in brilliantly stylized settings in which trees, clouds, smokestacks, telephone poles, water and snow are rendered as rhythmic and dramatic shapes that play off one another almost musically. Too, he was a superb colorist, assigning psychological properties to each color, red in particular, which he considered symbolic of power and energy. Among the best works here are his last ones, landscapes that have the magic of Expressionist theater, with houses, trees and the like assuming almost human presences. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3676. (Glueck) *WHITNEY MUSEUM: ROBERT SMITHSON, through Oct. 23. Who knows whether Smithson is the most influential American postwar artist, as this show claims. Consisting mostly of drawings, photographs and films (he didn't make many sculptures, not ones that could fit into a museum, anyway), this is the first full-scale overview of him in the country. It is consequently dry but still compelling testimony to a great exuberance cut drastically short when Smithson died at 35 in a plane crash in 1973. (See above.)(Michael Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Uptown</p>
        <p>*ADAM DANT: 'STANDING UNDER' An extraordinarily imaginative and skillful draftsman, Mr. Dant makes large pen-and-brush drawings of complex scenes populated by chunky little people, all viewed as if from below through a transparent ground or floor. Adam Baumgold, 74 East 79th Street, (212)861-7338, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>'VIETNAM: DESTINATION FOR THE NEW MILLENNIUM -THE ART OF DINH Q. LE' Born in Vietnam, Mr. Le moved to the United States at age 11 and received a master of fine arts degree from the School of Visual Arts in New York. This small exhibition presents high-concept photographic and sculptural works about the Vietnam War and its effects, as well as a pair of sleek sculptures representing communications satellites that satirize Vietnam's plans to enter the space age and the global consumerist economy. Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212)288-6400, through Jan. 15. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Galleries: 57th Street</p>
        <p>HENRY WOLF Organized by the photography critic Vince Aletti, this exhibition presents works by the suave art director, designer and photographer Henry Wolf (1925-2005). Examples of his designs for magazine covers and pictures by photographers that he commissioned are on view, but the most interesting part is the selection of Wolf's noncommercial photographs, which are compelling for their ultramodern ways with light, multiple spaces, speed and glamour. Howard Greenberg, 41 East 57th Street, (212)334-0010, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>*ROBERT BORDO A beautiful, quietistic show by a painter whose work always manages to be both grounded and ethereal, soundless and resonant, abstract and not. Mr. Bordo is at midcareer. The time for a retrospective view is at hand. Alexander and Bonin, 132 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, (212)367-7474, through Oct. 22. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>'LANDSCAPE: MYTH AND MEMORY' Miniature ruins built of tiny bricks on rocky landscapes made of clay by Charles Simmonds; large, faux antique photographs of Egyptian pyramids by Lynn Davis; an enormous, crusty book by Anselm Kiefer open to the photographic image of ancient architectural remains; and archetypal circles painted and photographed by Richard Long all add up to a nicely choreographed collective fantasy about primordial civilizations. Senior &amp; Shopmaker, 21 East 26th Street, (212)213-6767, through Nov. 23. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>NICK MAUSS This fleet, stylish show has a muffled cries-and-whispers sense of mystery. The small paintings and drawings suggest hurried sketches and half-erased images from a suppressed larger narrative. The tites of two paintings, ''Urgent'' and ''Paraphrase,'' sum up the dynamic. Daniel Reich, 537 A West 23rd Street, (212)924-4949, through Oct. 22. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>SUE WILLIAMS Few artists have combined figurative abstract painting and existential disgust as variously and effectively as Sue Williams has, and the trajectory continues in this show of new work. Here the battered body parts and de Kooning-esque swipes of the past have been distilled into a tumorous universe of genitals, anuses and noxious emissions, as the biological becomes political. 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, (212)255-1121, through Oct. 29. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Other Galleries</p>
        <p>CLAIRE FONTAINE Politically charged works by this French artist include a neon-light work that outlines the image of a hooded Iraqi prisoner and child; a neon sign in the gallery's front window that says in Arabic, ''Foreigners Everywhere''; and a tiny sculpture called ''In God We Trust'' in the form of a 25-cent coin with a fold-out box cutter secreted inside. Reena Spaulings, 371 Grand Street, SoHo, (212)477-5006, through Oct. 21. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>VIOLA FREY: 'A LASTING LEGACY' This show of the last ceramic sculptures of Viola Frey (1933-2004) is dominated by outsize figures, among them a standing man more than 10 feet tall and a goddesslike seated nude more than 6 feet high, both in white-glazed clay. Although they are untouched by color, a number of slightly earlier works blaze with her usual painterly panache, like the brilliant orange hands and tie, yellow shirt and multicolored face she gave to the large ''Seated Man, Foot Poised on World,'' who seems to kick away a globe in anger or frustration. Nancy Hoffman Gallery, 429 West Broadway, (212)431-3600, through Oct 25. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>*ANDRÉ KERTESZ From tiny, wonderfully intense pictures made in the teens in Budapest, where Kertesz was born in 1894, to formally acute views of Paris in the 20's and 30's to emotionally and metaphorically resonant images of New York, where he lived from 1936 to his death in 1985, this beautiful exhibition covers the career of a giant of 20th-century photography. International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000, through Nov. 27. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>*MACCHINE NATURALI: 'ABSTRACT COLLAGES BY JOSEPH STELLA' The largest New York show in some time of Stella's elegant, understated collages, made from dirt-stained scraps of paper, can thoroughly rearrange your grasp of his sensibility and the history of American Modernism. Peter Freeman Inc., 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo (212)966-5349, through Oct. 29. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>*Diane Arbus: 'Other Faces, Other Rooms' If you think you are sufferingfrom Diane Arbus fatigue, this exhibition of 49 photographs that have not been widely published or exhibited will surely refresh your interest. Robert Miller, 524 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)366-4774, closing tomorrow.(Johnson)</p>
        <p>*TOM BURCKHARDT: 'FULL STOP'  A painter of eclectically layered abstractions has produced a surprising environmental installation: a slightly old-fashioned, fully equipped painter's studio made of brown corrugated cardboard and black paint. Caren Golden, 539 West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212)727-8304, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>WOUTER DERUYTTER: 'CROW WARRIORS' You could almost mistake Mr. Deruytter's black-and-white, subtly erotic photographs of Crow Indian warriors in face paint, feathered headdresses and loin cloths, riding bareback horses, for 19th-century ethnographic documents. In fact, they depict contemporary American Indians gathered for an annual re-enactment of the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Briggs Robinson, 527 West 29th Street, (212)560-9075, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>*OMER FAST: 'GODVILLE' Video editing is virtuosic medium in Omer Fast's hands, and history a malleable, volatile subject composed of flickering bits and pieces, as seen in this two-channel installation shot in Colonial Williamsburg, a Revolution-era reconstruction where docents dressed in 18th-century clothes, play period roles. Postmasters, 459 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)727-3323, closing tomorrow. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>*MONIQUE PRIETO AND LYNDA BENGLIS Ms. Prieto has, in effect, boarded over her abstract paintings with rough-hewn monolithic letters quoting Samuel Pepys's diary. Both the wordiness and the klunkiness are a bit familiar, but extracting Pepys's phrases, which are all deliberately disembodied in reference, can be strangely satisfying. In ''The Graces,'' Ms. Benglis continues to evoke figures by other means, in this case three shimmering stacks of vaselike forms made of heavily textured, lavender-tinted resin. The material is perfect for the process-oriented Ms. Benglis. Cheim &amp; Read, 547 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-7727, closing tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>'RUSSIA REDUX NO.1' Organized by Elena Sorokina, this show of work by a dozen contemporary artists and artists' collectives from the former Soviet Union is a supplement and critical rejoinder to the celebratory, Putin-power national portrait presented in ''Russia!'' at the Guggenheim Museum. Schroeder Romero, 173A N. Third Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)486-8992, closing on Monday. . A second exhibition organized by Ms. Sorokina is at Momenta Art, 72 Berry St., Williamsburg, also closing on Monday. (Cotter)</p>

Samuel Beckett Theater on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200.</p>
        <p>'JERSEY BOYS' Opens Nov. 6. Straight from La Jolla Playhouse in California, this rags-to-riches musical tells the story of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, featuring hits that include ''Big Girls Don't Cry'' and ''Rag Doll.'' Des McAnuff directs (2:30). Beginning Sunday, the theater will be renamed the August Wilson Theater. Virginia Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212)239-6200.</p>
        <p>'KARLA' Previews start Thursday. Opens October 23. The Grammy-winning musician Steve Earle, who starred in the political docudrama ''The Exonerated,'' takes up the issue of the death penalty once again, but this time as a playwright in this drama about Karla Faye Tucker, the first woman in Texas since the Civil War to receive the death penalty and have it carried out (1:30). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, East Village, (212)352-3101.</p>
        <p>'MANIC FLIGHT REACTION' Previews start Thursday. Opens October 30.

It started at the Watermill Theater in England, before moving to the West End and Broadway (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200.</p>

        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldbergesque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Ben Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>*'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'A NAKED GIRL ON THE APPIAN WAY'  Could it be that the exhaustingly prolific Richard Greenberg has been even busier than anyone suspected? This clunky farce about the limits of liberalism, directed by Doug Hughes and starring a miscast Richard Thomas and Jill Clayburgh, suggests Mr. Greenberg has been moonlighting as a gag writer for sitcoms and is now recycling his discarded one-liners (1:45). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212)719-1300. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>*'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>*'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'CRESTFALL' Taking place in a town described by one character as ''this insidious vicinity, the savage quarter, this perpetual crestfall,'' the speeding train of a play, which features three interconnected monologues spoken by a sex addict, a frigid woman and a whore, reveals a writer who loves words almost as much as he does dirty jokes and bloody faces. Since he made his first American splash with ''Howie the Rookie'' in 2001, Mark O'Rowe, who writes likes a mix of Samuel Beckett and Martin McDonagh, has grown in confidence, if not in maturity (1:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, between Park and Madison Avenues, (212)279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'CYCLING PAST THE MATTERHORN' A grating comedy-drama by Deborah Grimberg about the fractious relationship between a mother and daughter. Shirley Knight plays Esther, a needy, needling woman who discovers she's going blind just as her daughter leaves the nest. Carrie Preston is her needy, self-absorbed daughter (1:35). Harold Clurman Theater on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200.(Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)</p>
        <p>'EINSTEIN'S GIFT'  Vern Thiessen's potentially moving play about two German-Jewish Nobel winners -- the physicist Albert Einstein and the chemist Fritz Haber -- their differing conceptions of science's role and the martial use to which their work is put, is marred by unnecessary ''Odd Couple'' exchanges and a miscast Haber, but benefits from good performances by Shawn Elliott as Einstein and Melissa Friedman as Haber's wife (2:00). Acorn Theater on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200. (Andrea Stevens)</p>
        <p>* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE GREAT AMERICAN TRAILER PARK MUSICAL' A terrific cast keeps the generator running in this bright but flimsy contraption. A few of David Nehls's dozen ditties raise a hearty chuckle, like the valedictory anthem in which the show's heroines collectively vow to ''make like a nail and press on.'' But Betsy Kelso's book all but dispenses with plot, and substitutes crude cartoons for characters (2:00). Dodger Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>*'IN THE CONTINUUM' A spirited, smart and powerful portrait of two black women whose lives are suddenly upended by an H.I.V. diagnosis. Written by and starring Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter, who both possess the strong presence and confident technique to bring out the subtle force and the potent flavoring in their writing (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, between Park and Madison Avenues, (212)279-4200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE LADIES OF THE CORRIDOR' The Peccadillo Theater Company has revived this 1953 play by Dorothy Parker and Arnaud D'Usseau. A comedy set in an East Side hotel populated by widows and divorcées, it is an unyielding and coruscating portrait of women before feminism, relieved by Parker's dead-on wit. East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212)279-4200.(Honor Moore)</p>
        <p>'LATE FRAGMENT'  Matthew, a World Trade Center employee who survived Sept. 11, and Marta are a desperate couple falling out of love in Francine Volpe's often perceptive if muddled drama named after a Raymond Carver poem. Under the direction of Michael Imperioli (Christopher from ''The Sopranos'') and Zetna Fuentes, the play has a wobbly style, building tension only to diffuse it with less-than-credible moments (1:30). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212)279-4200. (Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'MARION BRIDGE'  The Canadian playwright Daniel McIvor takes a quiet, honest look at three sisters as they face their mother's death. It is well acted and well directed, if too predictable in spots (2:20). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, (212)868-4444. (Margo Jefferson)</p>
        <p>'THE MASTER BUILDER'  A revival that succeeds mainly through a fine performance by Dan Daily as the superstar architect of the title. Mr. Daily brings the character's tangle of contradictions together in a credible performance that manages to find the hidden troll in the artistic genius (2:20). Pearl Theater, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212)598-9802.(Wilborn Hampton)</p>
        <p>'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Jefferson)</p>
        <p>'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' With a storm trooper roaming the aisles and a woman in an Obi-Wan Kenobi get-up telling theatergoers to turn off their cellphones or they will be turned into ''cosmic dust,'' Charles Ross's sprint through Episodes IV through VI strives for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention, but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but everyone else will scratch their heads (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Zinoman)</p>
        <p>*'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros,'' which was directed by Orson Welles and starred Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE PAVILION' Craig Wright's play about the speedy wheels of time's winged chariot and the dreams it grinds into dust is set at a small-town high school reunion. Brian D'Arcy James aches with longing as the cad who wants a second chance. Gracefully directed by Lucie Tiberghien (2:00). Rattlestick Theater, 224 Waverly Place, at 11th Street, West Village, (212)868-4444. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>*'SIDES: THE FEAR IS REAL' This hilarious collection of sketches may send up familiar targets -- the insecure thespian, the fraudulent acting teacher, the arrogant Juilliard grad -- but since it's performed with such specificity and comic charm by actors firing on all cylinders, you won't care a whit. Written by and starring an entirely Asian-American cast, this slight but consistently entertaining satire is a primer on what not to do in an audition room (1:15). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)307-4100. (Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'SLUT'  This overamplified musical comedy about love and promiscuity among East Village friends leans heavily on obscenities to lend it a daring edge. Instead, it swamps even its brightest moments in tawdriness (2:00). American Theater of Actors, 314 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Miriam Horn)</p>
        <p>'WALKING DOWN BROADWAY' Dawn Powell's 1931 tale of young people looking for life and love in New York is packed with smart dialogue and honest emotions. It is also well directed, well acted and smartly designed (2:30). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)315-0231. (Jefferson)</p>
        <p>Off Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'BELLY OF A DRUNKEN PIANO' In this splendidly imperfect cabaret, Stewart D'Arrietta howls and growls convincingly through Tom Waits's three-decade song catalog, backed by a snappy trio. His patter and his piano playing are variable, but Mr. D'Arrietta makes a genial tour guide through Mr. Waits's wee-hours world (1:45). Huron Club at SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212)691-1555. (Rob Kendt)</p>
        <p>Long-Running Shows</p>
        <p>'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212)307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200.(Brantley)</p>
        <p>'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>*'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212)307-4100.(Van Gelder)</p>
        <p>'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>'DEDICATION, OR THE STUFF OF DREAMS' Portraying a terminally ill, rancidly rich misanthrope in Terrence McNally's play about a small-town children's theater troupe, Marian Seldes is a snappy advertisement for the time-defying benefits of a religious devotion to theater. She is, in fact, what ''Dedication'' is all about, or intends to be, anyway. Burdened with soap-opera-ish plot turns and artificially bright dialogue, this comedy of mortality never seems able to convince itself that life and art trump death and doubt. (2:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200, closing Sunday. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE GREAT AMERICAN DESERT' Garrett Ayers, who calls his latest company the TryTryAgain Theater, says this is his third attempt at staging this short play from 1961 by Joel Oppenheimer. It's fun. It's performed with spunk. It's got cowboys. Sure, it's indecipherable, but hey, it's less than an hour long (55 minutes). 78th Street Theater Lab, 236 West 78th Street, (800)838-3006, closing Sunday.( Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>*'THE INTELLIGENT DESIGN OF JENNY CHOW' In Rolin Jones's fanciful comedy, playfully directed by Jackson Gay, a lonely young woman in California embarks on an ambitious science project to help conquer her agoraphobia and trace her origins in China. Brisk, funny and engaging, the play disappoints only in its emphasis on flights of fancy over a nuanced depiction of its heroine's emotional dilemmas (2:10). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)239-6200, closing tomorrow.(Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'ONCE AROUND THE SUN' The ''sun'' of the title could be the talent and energy of the show's impressive cast: you can warm your hands on them and on the catchy music. Unfortunately, the book fails to capitalize on these strengths, instead presenting a trite fable about a young rock singer seduced by celebrity, with cardboard characters, despite the actors' best efforts to give them dimension. Still, the performances are very entertaining (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200, closing Sunday. (Anne Midgette)</p>
        <p>*'POOR THEATER' Part homage and part anatomy, the Wooster Group's warm, witty tribute to the director Jerzy Grotowski and the choreographer William Forsythe demonstrates how imitation can be not just sincere flattery but also a hopeful attempt to crawl into someone else's skin to see how it fits. As identities and their representations morph and blur, this is not always a comfortable activity, but it is often an exhilarating one (1:30). Performing Garage, 33 Wooster Street, between Broome and Grand Streets, SoHo, (212)868-4444, closing tomorrow. (Brantley)</p>

        <p>Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.</p>
        <p>'BEFORE THE FALL' (No rating, 110 minutes, in German) Dennis Gansel's intensely beautiful film brings us inside one of Hitler's elite schools used to indoctrinate future leaders to observe the fate of a young amateur boxer and his sensitive roommate. Though somewhat overdetermined, the film is a chilling testament to the seductiveness of groupthink and the allure of imagined superiority.(Jeannette Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'BROKEN FLOWERS' (R, 105 minutes) Sweet, funny, sad and meandering, Jim Jarmusch's new film sends Bill Murray's aging Don Juan out in search of a son he never knew he had. He finds four former lovers, including Sharon Stone and Jessica Lange, and reveals once again that he is the quietest and finest comic actor working in movies today. (A.O. Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'CAPOTE' (R, 114 minutes) Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote is a tour de force of psychological insight. Following the novelist as he works on the magazine assignment that will become ''In Cold Blood,'' the film raises intriguing questions about the ethics of writing. (Scott)</p>
        <p>*'THE CONSTANT GARDENER' (R, 129 minutes) A superior thriller with a conscience, from John le Carré's novel. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'DANDELION' (No rating, 93 minutes) Mark Milgard's debut film is an affectedly glum slice of life about a depressed teenager in rural Washington State who takes the rap for his father after a hit-and-run accident. (Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>'EVERYTHING IS ILLUMINATED' (PG-13, 104 minutes) From Jonathan Safran Foer's novel, a sentimental Holocaust tale; tender and funny in places, but also thin and soft. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE' (PG-13, 114 minutes) If you must see only one demonic-possession courtroom drama this year, wait for the next one. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'FLIGHTPLAN' (PG-13, 93 minutes) To watch Jodie Foster storm through a phony airplane as a mother in search of her missing child has its very minor pleasures, but there is nothing in this thrill-free thriller to feed the head or fray the nerves. (Manohla Dargis)</p>
        <p>*'THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN' (R, 111 minutes) A sex comedy turned romantic bliss-out, with Steve Carell, in which the sound of one prophylactic snapping is just a single sweet note in the glorious symphony of love. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>*'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is both a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism (Scott)</p>
        <p>'GOING SHOPPING' (PG-13, 106 minutes) As loquacious and scatterbrained as its female characters, this Henry Jaglom film explores women's shopping habits and fantasies. Its incomplete sketches revolve around an upscale dress shop on the verge of bankruptcy. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'THE GOSPEL' (PG, 105 minutes) Set against a lively, music-filled African-American church, ''The Gospel,'' written and directed by Rob Hardy, and with many talented real-life gospel superstars blended into the large and able cast, endeavors to be a powerful tale of faith and forgiveness, but in the end fails to capture even the slightest essence of spirituality and religious belief, or to provide any real insight into its characters' conflicts, desires and motivations.(Laura Kern)</p>
        <p>'THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED' (PG, 115 minutes) A rousing, obvious re-creation of the 1913 United States Open, in which two sons of the working classes faced off in a game still dominated, on both sides of the Atlantic, by the well-born. Aims for par and makes it. (Scott)</p>
        <p>*'GRIZZLY MAN' (R, 103 minutes) Werner Herzog's bold, enthralling documentary about one man's journey into the heart of darkness (and the belly of the beast) traces the life and strange times of the self-anointed grizzly expert Timothy Treadwell. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE' (R, 97 minutes) A masterpiece of indirection and pure visceral thrills about a seemingly average American family almost undone by cataclysmic violence, David Cronenberg's latest mindblower is the feel-good, feel-bad movie of the year. With Viggo Mortensen, Maria Bello, Ed Harris and William Hurt, all excellent. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'IN HER SHOES' (PG-13, 130 yes, 130 minutes) In his newest film, Curtis Hanson (''L. A. Confidential'') wrests a richly textured story of love from a seemingly unlikely source, Jennifer Weiner's breezy best-selling fiction about two sisters -- played by Cameron Diaz and Toni Collette -- engaged in an epic battle of the heart, a fight waged mostly against each other and their own best interests.(Dargis)</p>
        <p>'JUST LIKE HEAVEN' (PG-13, 95 minutes) Reese Witherspoon's disembodied spirit haunts Mark Ruffalo in a real estate dispute that runs into a sweet romantic comedy. Surprisingly lighthearted and brisk, considering its fairly morbid premise.(Scott)</p>
        <p>'LORD OF WAR' (R, 122 minutes) A misfire of a political satire about the international gun market from Andrew Niccol, a filmmaker whose words say no, but whose overworked visual style says lock and load, baby. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'MAGNIFICENT DESOLATION: WALKING ON THE MOON 3D' (No rating, 40 minutes) Tom Hanks narrates this Imax film that tries to give moviegoers the virtual experience of being on the lunar surface. At times it comes close. (Anita Gates)</p>
        <p>*'MARCH OF THE PENGUINS' (G, 80 minutes) This sentimental but riveting documentary follows the one-year mating cycle of emperor penguins in Antarctica when they leave the ocean and march inland to breed and lay eggs. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, the film has no qualms about playing on our emotions. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'MIRRORMASK' (PG, 101 minutes) This British film, directed by Dave McKean from a screenplay by Neil Gaiman, blends live action with computer-generated animation by the Jim Henson Company into a provocative, murky surrealism. The story follows the Freudian nightmare of a 15-year-old girl whose parents work in the circus; it's strictly for cultists. (Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'OLIVER TWIST' (PG-13, 130 minutes) Roman Polanski's take on Dickens's classic emphasizes the darkness and cruelty of Victorian society. Vigorous and precise, it is a vivid reminder of the novelist's power as both a storyteller and a social critic. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'THE PRIZE WINNER OF DEFIANCE, OHIO' (PG-13, 99 minutes) Julianne Moore is radiant as Evelyn Ryan, the real-life 1950's Ohio housewife and mother of 10 who kept her family afloat on her winnings from television jingle contests. Jane Anderson wrote and directed this tribute in a wonderfully zany, off-center style. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'ROLL BOUNCE' (PG-13, 107 minutes) A drowsy comedy from Malcolm D. Lee about a handful of kids grooving and roller skating in the summer of 1978, ''Roll Bounce'' has heart and good vibes but little else to recommend it. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'SEPARATE LIES' (R, 87 minutes) A hit-and-run accident near the country house of an imperious British lawyer (magnificently played by Tom Wilkinson) leads him into an ethical labyrinth that tests his moral mettle as well as that of his wife (Emily Watson) and her lover (Rupert Everett). (Holden)</p>
        <p>'SERENITY' (PG-13, 119 minutes) It probably isn't fair to Joss Whedon's ''Serenity'' to say that this unassuming science-fiction adventure is superior in almost every respect to George Lucas's aggressively more ambitious ''Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith.'' But who cares about fair when there is fun to be had? Scene for scene, ''Serenity'' is more engaging and certainly better written and acted than any of Mr. Lucas's recent screen entertainments. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'THE SQUID AND THE WHALE' (R, 88 minutes) Mining his own childhood, Noah Baumbach has put together an unsparing, funny portrait of a family in crisis and a young man trying to figure out his parents and himself. Superbly written and acted, especially by Laura Linney and Jeff Daniels as a pair of divorcing writers. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'TIM BURTON'S CORPSE BRIDE' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A necrophiliac animation for the whole family about a melancholic boy, the girl he hopes to marry and the bodacious cadaver that accidentally comes between them. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'TOUCH THE SOUND' (No rating, 99 minutes) As Thomas Riedelsheimer's enlightening, mystical documentary follows the deaf Scottish percussionist Evelyn Glennie around the globe, it illustrates her understanding that sound is a physical sensation experienced throughout the body, as well as an auditory one. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'TWO FOR THE MONEY' (R, 122 minutes) A turgid male weepie in which Matthew McConaughey plays a former college quarterback turned sports-betting guru under the loud tutelage of Al Pacino's odds-making kingpin. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'WALLACE &amp; GROMIT: THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT' (G, 85 minutes) The stop-motion pooch and his cheese-loving master, back again at feature length. Silly and sublime. (Scott)</p>

        <p>ATMOSPHERE, BLUEPRINT, P.O.S.

        <p>THE BRAVERY, INTERNATIONAL NOISE CONSPIRACY (Thursday) A less downcast version of neo-new-wave, the Bravery is tougher than its contemporaries like the Killers, if not always as much fun. International Noise Conspiracy plays politically minded garage rock that's been getting less political lately. 6:30 p.m., Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212)247-0200; $23.50. (Sinagra)</p>

(Jon Pareles)</p>
        <p>JUNIOR BROWN, ABIGAIL WASHBURN (Tuesday) Junior Brown has his own instrument: the doublenecked ''guit-steel'' allows him to play biting electric guitar leads in one verse and suave steel guitar in the next. In most of his music he's a country traditionalist, true to honky-tonk tempos and the deadpan baritone vocal style of Ernest Tubb. Every so often he lets loose a Jimi Hendrix lick. Abigail Washburn opens. 8 p.m., B.B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>CARL COX (Tomorrow) The British D.J. Carl Cox, who has been playing the big clubs since disco, plays techno and house-based mixes more eclectic than standard trance. 10 p.m., Crobar, 530 West 28th Street, Chelsea, (212)629-9000; $30. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>BLACKEST OF THE BLACK: DANZIG AND GUESTS (Monday) The stout, muscularly macabre rocker Glen Danzig and his eponymous heavy-metal band lead a lineup of similar acts: Himsa, Mortiis, Chimaira, Behemoth and the Agony Scene. 6:30 p.m., Nokia Theater Times Square, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street; ticketmaster.com or (212)307-7171; $28.50. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>DEATH CAB FOR CUTIE (Wednesday and Thursday) This decorous diarist-rock band's sound gets added alternative-rock heft on its new album, ''Plans'' (Atlantic). The melodic Australian poppers Youth Group open both nights, with the dreamy but prickly Canadian pop band the Stars joining the bill on Thursday. 6:30 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-7740; $25.50. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>DEVENDRA BANHART (Thursday) Mr. Banhart's eerie, wavery voice and stream-of-consciousness songs reach back to the childlike surrealism of some of psychedelia's most beloved oddballs: Syd Barrett and the preglam rock of Marc Bolan. 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600;$20 in advance, $25 at the door. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>DUNGEN (Tomorrow and Sunday) This Swedish band's biker-rock combines humongous riffing with whimsical jams, conjuring black-leather aggression and the pastoral wonder of the open road. 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; $15. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>THE FIERY FURNACES (Tonight) This brother-and-sister art-rock duo's music cuts melodies with carnivalesque keyboard vamps and digressive skronk.

(Sinagra)</p>
        <p>FOO FIGHTERS, WEEZER, HOT HOT HEAT (Tonight) Dave Grohl, the former Nirvana drummer, has been leading the energetic alt-rock Foo Fighters for a decade, proving that cocky affability goes a long way. The nerd-pop masters Weezer continue to write textbook pop melodies, but their scruffiest album, 1996's ''Pinkerton'' (Geffen) is the favorite of a fanatical cult of emo kids. The peppy rockers Hot Hot Heat open. 7 p.m., Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J., (201)935-3900; $30.50 to $42.50. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>FRANZ FERDINAND, TV ON THE RADIO (Monday) At the vanguard of the post -- post-punk trend, the poker-faced Franz Ferdinand plays herky-jerky party music. TV on the Radio tops its jittery rhythms and paranoid guitars with the haunting vocal yelps of Tunde Adebimpe and Kyp Malone. 7:30 p.m., Theater at Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue, Manhattan; (212)465-6741; $40. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>JIMMIE DALE GILMORE (Tuesday) The Texas troubadour Jimmie Dale Gilmore has been equating wistful Western expanse with the mysteries of existence for three decades.

(Pareles)</p>
        <p>KRISTIN HERSH (Sunday) The singer-songwriter, who led the mid-90's band Throwing Muses and found underground fame giving punk rock a twist of Wiccan ethereality, continues to make unflinching music about the modern female condition, among other things. 7:30 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3132; $14. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>ILL EASE (Tonight) The drummer and singer-songwriter Elizabeth Sharp, whose thin, insistent voice recalls the Velvet Underground's Mo Tucker, repeats inspired OCD chants matter-of-factly over her entrancing rattletrap grooves and her guitarist's distorted, looping riffs. 8:30 p.m., Cake Shop, 152 Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)253-0036; $7. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>JUANA MOLINA (Thursday) The reveries of the Argentine songwriter Juana Molina are built from her acoustic guitar picking, her hushed voice, melodies with the simplicity of lullabies and rustling, rippling, melting synthesizer backdrops that fill the songs with mystery. 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212)539-8770; $15. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>JASON MRAZ, RAUL MIDON (Sunday and Monday) Jason Mraz plays countrified, roots pop in the coffeehouse vein.

He plays his own material here. 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)875-5766; $35.50. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>MY MORNING JACKET, KATHLEEN EDWARDS (Monday) With his atmospheric take on Southern rock, My Morning Jacket's Jim James conjures a fantasy of Neil Young and Lynyrd Skynyrd jamming together, stoned, in an echo chamber. The singer-songwriter Kathleen Edwards opens. 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600; $25. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>LIZ PHAIR, MATT POND (Monday and Tuesday) One of the 90's most riveting indie-rock singer-songwriters, the smart, sexually candid Liz Phair has been angling for a radio hit for a few albums now. Her new ''Somebody's Miracle'' (Capitol) is again too quirky for MTV, but too slick-sounding for indie devotees. Opener Matt Pond writes pleasing, if forgettable, pop songs. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212)777-6800; $25. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>SON VOLT, FRUIT BATS (Wednesday) Son Volt's Jay Farrar, the gruff-voiced, country-rock half of the seminal alt-country band Uncle Tupelo, has gone in a different direction from his former bandmate, Wilco's Jeff Tweedy, preferring stolid reflection to stylistic adventurism. The ruminative folk-pop band the Fruit Bats opens. 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600; $20 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>SUPERPITCHER, ADA (Wednesday) The German producer Aksel Schaufler, aka Superpitcher, can make pure electropop as well as create a mood of glitchy claustrophobia. The singer and producer Ada recorded a stripped-down Kraftwerk-style version of the neo-punk Yeah Yeah Yeah's gem ''Maps.'' 11 p.m., Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, Chinatown, (212)941-8100; $10 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>ROB THOMAS (Tuesday and Wednesday) The singer for the popular rock group Matchbox 20 is remaking himself as a pinup boy and trying his hand at hip-hop-inflected pop songs. This incarnation has yet to be as compelling as the last, though his voice still carries a convincing mainstream angst and he rides grooves with ease. 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212)496-7070; $38.50 to $78.50. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>U2, KEANE (Tonight) After 2000's thrilling ''All That You Can't Leave Behind'' (Interscope), U2's latest album, ''How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb'' (Interscope), and its ''Vertigo'' tour focus on what humans can live without: namely, intercontinental ballistic missiles and, evidently, some of U2's more shopworn live staples. Hence the resurrection of decades-old rarities like ''Electric Co.'' Keane is a piano-drums-vocals band that piles on hooky melodic flourishes. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue, Manhattan, (212)465-6741; $54.00 to $169.50. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>JOHN VANDERSLICE, PORTASTATIC (Tonight and tomorrow) A collaborator of the Mountain Goats' clever songsmith John Darnielle, Mr. Vanderslice also writes his own less clever songs.

Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)230-0236; $12. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>KELLER WILLIAMS (Tonight) The guitarist and singer Keller Williams has been working the jam-band circuit; using loop and echo effects he turns his 10-stringed guitar into a full band. His mild voice has more than a touch of James Taylor, but his fast fingers delight the kind of fan one of his songs describes as a ''Freaker by the Speaker.'' 9 p.m., Nokia Theater Times Square, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street; ticketmaster.com or (212)307-7171; $22.50. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>WACO BROTHERS BLOODSHOT REVUE (Tonight) Jon Langford of the Mekons indulges his country side even more strongly in the Waco Brothers, where he trades off lead vocals with Dean Schlabowske and ricochets between revolution and beer-soaked self-pity while letting his electric guitar blare. The Mekons' Sally Timms joins the bill. 8 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)230-0236; $14. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>YONDER MOUNTAIN STRING BAND (Thursday) Yonder Mountain String Band, from Colorado, carries a traditionalist bluegrass lineup -- banjo, guitar, mandolin and bass, with high vocal harmonies and no drums -- onto the jam-band circuit, picking its way through songs of wanderlust and thwarted love. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212)777-6800; $25. (Pareles)</p>

        <p>*ELAINE STRITCH (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday) In a courageous and successful leap into the unknown, Ms. Stritch makes her cabaret debut at 80. Dispensing with her theatrical signature numbers, she weaves 16 songs new to her repertory into a funny running monologue of her adventures in and out of show business. 8:45 p.m., Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212)744-1600; $125 tonight and tomorrow, $105 Tuesday through Thursday, through Oct. 29 (all shows sold out).

(Chinen)</p>
        <p>OLU DARA QUINTET (Tomorrow and Sunday) Before he was known as the father of the rapper Nas, Mr. Dara was a trumpeter, guitarist and singer who infused New York avant-gardism with Mississippi twang, territory he revisits in a group featuring the guitarist Kwatei Jones-Quartey. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212)475-8592; cover, $30 at tables, with a $5 minimum or $20 at the bar and a one-drink minimum.

        <p>*DIZZY GILLESPIE ALUMNI ALL-STARS (Tuesday through Oct. 23) Dizzy Gillespie, the trumpeter and bebop patriarch, was among the finest talent scouts in jazz; this band features some especially gifted veterans of his employ, including the saxophonists James Moody and Paquito D'Rivera, the trombonist Slide Hampton and the bassist John Lee. Roy Hargrove, a dazzling inheritor, will take the lead on trumpet and flugelhorn. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212)475-8592; cover, $35 at tables, with a $5 minimum or $20 at the bar and a one-drink minimum.

(Chinen)</p>
        <p>MANHATTAN TRINITY (Through Sunday) This piano trio deserves the high-minded handle; its members are the soulful pianist Cyrus Chestnut, the erudite bassist George Mraz and the clean, crisp drummer Lewis Nash. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, Jazz at Lincoln Center, (212)258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>WYNTON MARSALIS SEXTET (Tomorrow) Mr. Marsalis's strong new album, ''Live at the House of Tribes'' (Blue Note), finds the trumpeter pursuing a sanguine and purposeful looseness; he'll seek the same here, in a group with the tenor saxophonist Walter Blanding Jr., the pianist Dan Nimmer, the bassist Carlos Enriquez, the drummer Ali Jackson and the guest singer Jennifer Sanon. 8 p.m., Prudential Hall, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888)466-5722; $20 to $56.(Chinen)</p>
        <p>PAT MARTINO (Wednesday through Oct. 22) A dazzlingly proficient guitarist, Mr. Martino favors a brand of aggressive postbop that has more than a little in common with the blistering fusion of his youth. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212)581-3080; cover, $40, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>

        <p>DAVID MURRAY QUARTET/OMAR SOSA QUARTET (Sunday) Two bands that favor an earthy kind of progressivism: one led by the impressionistic Cuban pianist Omar Sosa and the other led by the blustery tenor saxophonist David Murray. 3 p.m., Victoria Theater, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888)466-5722; $42. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>EIVIND OPSVIK OVERSEAS (Sunday) On his new album, ''Overseas II'' (Fresh Sound New Talent), the Norwegian bassist Eivind Opsvik plumbs a strikingly modern (and yes, vaguely Nordic) brand of fusion; his partners here are the tenor saxophonist Tony Malaby, the keyboardist Jacob Sacks and the drummer Jeff Davis. 10 p.m., Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue, at Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)218-6934; no cover. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>JEROME SABBAGH QUARTET (Tuesday) With ''North'' (Fresh Sound New Talent), Mr. Sabbagh proves himself a quietly commanding tenor saxophonist and composer in the postmodern mainstream; his sleek ensemble sound owes a lot to the guitar playing of Ben Monder. 9 and 10:30 p.m., Koze Lounge, 676 Fifth Avenue, at 20th Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)832-8282; cover, $7. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>SINGERS OVER MANHATTAN (Thursday through Oct. 22) The pianist Eric Reed leads a house rhythm section behind three varieties of modern jazz singer: the vivaciously cosmopolitan Carla Cooke, the debonair Sachal Vasandani and the precociously poised Jennifer Sanon. 7:30 p.m., Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, Jazz at Lincoln Center, (212)258-9595; $135. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>DR. LONNIE SMITH TRIO (Tonight and tomorrow) Under Dr. Smith's command, the Hammond B-3 organ can be subtly atmospheric or growlingly ecstatic; together with the guitarist Peter Bernstein and the drummer Alison Miller, Dr. Smith delivers a searching brand of soul-jazz. 9 and 11 p.m. and 12:30 a.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212)864-6662; cover, $25. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>CHARLES TOLLIVER BIG BAND (Wednesday through Oct. 23) Mr. Tolliver leads a new edition of his celebrated orchestra of the 1970's; among the top-shelf talent involved are the saxophonists Billy Harper and Craig Handy, the trombonist Clark Gayton and the drummer Ralph Peterson. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an additional 11:30 set Oct. 21 and 22, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232; cover, $25 to $30.

(Chinen)</p>
        <p>BEN WALTZER TRIO (Thursday) Mr. Waltzer, the pianist, manages a thoughtful modernism that coexists more than peaceably with a buoyant, unselfconscious sense of swing; his trio, with Matt Penman and Gerald Cleaver on bass and drums, is first-rate. 8 and 9:45 p.m., Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, Manhattan, (212)885-7119; no cover, $10 minimum.

        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>'AIDA' (Tonight, Tuesday) The Aida of the rich-voiced soprano Michèle Crider and the Amneris of the formidable mezzo-soprano Dolora Zajick are sure bets. What fans of ''Aida'' will be curious about when Sonja Frisell's production returns to the Metropolitan Opera is the Radames of the tenor Salvatore Licitra, who has yet to live up to the promise of his dramatic Met debut in 2002 as a last-minute replacement for Luciano Pavarotti. James Conlon conducts. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000, $26 to $205.(Anthony Tommasini)</p>
        <p>'ARIANE ET BARBE-BLEUE' (Tonight, Sunday) Paul Dukas's mysterious 1907 opera tells the legend of the fearsome Duke Bluebeard and his strangely disappearing wives from a woman's point of view. In its day the work was mentioned along with Debussy's ''Pelléas et Mélisande'' as a prime achievement of the post-Wagnerian French school. That this rich work has become a rarity is inexplicable. Thanks go to the New York City Opera for this new production, which is suitably Symbolist in look. It's too bad that the musical performance under the conductor Leon Botstein is so heavy-handed. Renate Behle brings Wagnerian intensity to the role of Ariane. Tonight at 8 and Sunday at 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500, $16 to $120. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>'IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA' (Tomorrow, Thursday) Hugh Russell, by all accounts a sweet-voiced baritone, makes his debut with the New York City Opera in the title role of Rossini's perennial favorite, joining Jennifer Rivera (as Rosina) and John Tessier (as Almaviva). Joseph Rescigno conducts. Tomorrow night at 8, Thursday night at 7:30, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500, $16 to $120. (Anne Midgette)</p>
        <p>'LA BOHÈME' (Tomorrow, Sunday) Pity a small opera company: it receives critical attention only when it does something unusual, yet its audiences tend to like the same fare as everyone else. Which is to say that ''La Bohème'' at the 204-seat Dicapo Opera Theater will receive few reviews, but remains a crowd favorite. Tomorrow night at 8, Sunday afternoon at 4, Dicapo Opera, 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212)288-9438, $47.50.(Midgette)</p>
        <p>'CARMEN' (Tomorrow) Though she missed her scheduled company debut because of illness, Milena Kitic is set to sing the role as planned this weekend. Ruth Ann Swenson is singing her first Micaëlas, prettily; Marco Berti is loud but untender as Don José; and Philippe Jordan brings a crisp touch as he tries to hold it all together from the pit. 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Remaining tickets: $220. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>'LA CENERENTOLA' (Monday, Thursday) Olga Borodina's mezzo-soprano is slightly dark for the title role in Rossini's Cinderella story, but she has the clarity and agility to bring this virtuosic, richly ornamental music to life. The rest of the cast -- including Barry Banks as the Prince, Simone Alberghini as Dandini and Simone Alaimo as Don Magnifico -- is well matched in this comic-book production by Cesare Lievi. Monday at 8 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000, $26 to $220. (Allan Kozinn)</p>
        <p>'FALSTAFF' (Tomorrow, Wednesday) The attention to detail that characterizes this production is truly unusual: it's well cast, well acted and well conducted by a masterly James Levine. It also features the reigning Falstaff of our day, Bryn Terfel, who is matched note for note by the fabulous Stephanie Blythe as Mistress Quickly -- she almost steals the show. Go see it. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000, $42 to $220. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>'TOSCA' (Tomorrow) Mark Lamos's 1998 production of this Puccini favorite has returned with its crisp geometric elegance intact. Carla Thelen Hanson is a respectable Tosca, and Todd Thomas is a vocally assured, larger-than-life Scarpia. But at the opening performance last week, Jorge Antonio Pita came up short as Cavaradossi, sounding underpowered and intermittently strained. John Demain conducts. 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500, $16 to $120. (Jeremy Eichler)</p>
        <p>Classical Music</p>

(Eichler)</p>
        <p>CECILIA BARTOLI (Wednesday) This great Italian mezzo-soprano promotes her new recording, ''Opera Proibita'' (Decca), with a recital of opera and oratorio arias by Scarlatti, Caldara and Handel. Orchestra La Scintilla of the Zurich Opera supports here, and will have its moment in the sun by way of Caldara and Handel overtures and a Corelli Concerto Grosso. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800, $37 to $127. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>BEAUX-ARTS TRIO (Tonight) This group, which -- at least in the person of its venerable founding pianist, Menahem Pressler -- has just turned 50, is in its second of three seasons surveying all the piano trios, violin sonatas and cello sonatas of Beethoven. In addition, it gives the American premiere of Jan Müller-Wieland's ''Schlaflied,'' or ''Lullaby.'' 8 p.m., Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212)570-3949; $50. (James R.

        <p>CHOIR OF ST. IGNATIUS LOYOLA (Thursday) The choir's director, Kent Tritle, who founded the church's invaluable program Sacred Music in a Sacred Space, conducts a performance of Haydn's glorious and underperformed oratorio ''The Creation.'' 8 p.m., Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, Park Avenue at 84th Street, (212)288-2520; $35 and $45; $25 for students and 65+. (Oestreich)</p>
        <p>CLEVELAND ORCHESTRA (Monday) Cleveland's conductor, Franz Welser-Möst, has been getting mixed reviews at home, but the orchestra's last stint in New York showed little reason for alarm and even included some of the loveliest Schubert heard in many moons. Composers of Mr. Welser-Möst's native Austria seem to draw from him a special affection and fluency, so it's good that he arrives next week bearing Brahms (the First Symphony and the ''Academic Festival Overture'') as well as the New York premiere of a work by Chen Yi. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800, $33 to $116. (Eichler)</p>
        <p>JUILLIARD STRING QUARTET (Thursday) The premiere of Ezequiel Viñao's String Quartet No. 2 is the centerpiece of this recital by one of this country's most venerable chamber ensembles. Included as well are Mozart's Quartet in G (K. 387) and Beethoven's Quartet in C sharp minor (Op. 131). 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)769-7406; free, but tickets are required. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>BLAIR McMILLEN and STEPHEN GOSLING (Tomorrow) ''Powerhouse Pianists'' is the title that the sponsoring American Modern Ensemble has given to this joint recital. Few people who have heard these formidable young pianists, champions of contemporary music, would quibble with the billing. Their inventive program includes works by, among others, Lee Hyla, Annie Gosfield, Conlon Nancarrow and David Rakowski. 8 p.m., Tenri Cultural Institute, 43A West 13th Street, Manhattan, (212)645-2800, $15; $10 for students and 65+.

        <p>CHRISTOPHER MALTMAN (Thursday) A stylish young baritone who has a particular warmth and affinity for song, Mr. Maltman appears with the accompanist Malcolm Martineau in a program of Schumann, Mahler and French song. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800, $35 to $42. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>NEW YORK FESTIVAL OF SONG (Wednesday) This survey features the ''singable'' (Festival's term) songs of the last quarter of the 20th century, including the work of John Musto, John Corigliano, Richard Thomas and Ricky Ian Gordon. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212)501-3330, $45; $35 for 65+. (Holland)</p>
        <p>NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Tuesday, Thursday). Marin Alsop has gotten attention lately for becoming the first woman appointed music director of a major American orchestra, receiving a MacArthur Foundation grant and working on a recorded Brahms symphony cycle. She comes to the Philharmonic with the Brahms First and Midori, who joins her in Prokofiev's first violin concerto. Beginning Thursday, Gianandrea Noseda and the pianist Simon Trpceski take on Rachmaninoff's Third. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Tuesday and Thursday nights at 7:30, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500, $26 to $94. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>PAULINE OLIVEROS and IONE (Wednesday) The Mercantile Library, which boasts a second-floor reading room of an ideally intimate size for chamber music, has joined the essential Meet the Composer organization for the concert series ''MTC at the Merc.'' These 60-minute programs also offer a chance to meet the composers and performers. Here the iconoclastic and inventive composer Pauline Oliveros, who also plays the accordion, will be joined by the playwright, poet and author Ione for a performance of ''Cross Overs,'' a musical work that explores, in the phrase of the creators, the sound of words and the making of words out of sound. 6:30 p.m., Mercantile Library, 17 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212)755-6710, $15. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>ORPHEUS CHAMBER ORCHESTRA (Tuesday) Richard Goode's pianism is always thoughtful and deeply felt, so hearing him in two concertos -- Mozart's ''Jeunehomme'' in E flat and Beethoven's Third -- is a rare treat. The program also includes overtures by J.C. Bach and Cherubini. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800, $30 to $88. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>FREDERIC RZEWSKI (Thursday) In this installment of the Miller Theater's important ''Composer Portraits'' series, the pianists Ursula Oppens and Marilyn Nonken, and the percussionists Tom Kolor and Dominic Donato explore some of Mr. Rzewski's powerful, politically charged works, including his magnificent set of piano variations on ''The People United Will Never Be Defeated.'' Included as well is the New York premiere of ''Bring Them Home,'' an antiwar piece. 8 p.m., Miller Theater, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212)854-7799, $20. (Kozinn)</p>

        <p>NEW YORK BUTOH FESTIVAL: DAISUKE YOSHIMOTO AND YUMIKO YOSHIOKA (Wednesday and Thursday) Two dances celebrate metamorphosis. ''Eros and Thanatos'' makes the naked body a landscape in flux.

The choreographer says her production is for mature audiences only.

        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'OBSESSIVE DRAWING,' through March 19. In the museum's first ''emerging talent'' show, one of the five artists selected is 83, lives in a home for the elderly in Pennsylvania and stopped painting two years ago because of failing eyesight. Overall, the work in the exhibition is abstract and spare, giving the problematic outsider category a new spin. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Holland Cotter)</p>
        <p>COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely techy show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'être is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400.(Grace Glueck)</p>
        <p>GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'RUSSIA!,' through Jan. 11. This survey of nine centuries of Russian art ranges from 13th-century religious icons to a smattering of 21st-century works, achieving its astounding effect without resorting to a single egg, or anything else, by Fabergé. It immerses us in two enormous, endlessly fascinating narratives: the history of painting and the history of Russia, forming a remarkable tribute to the endurance of the medium and the country, and the inescapable interconnectedness of art and life. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3600. (Roberta Smith)</p>
        <p>*JAPAN SOCIETY: 'HIROSHI SUGIMOTO: HISTORY OF HISTORY,' through Feb. 19. A very personal, whimsical exhibition by this well-known Japanese photographer, who incorporates into his work artifacts that he has collected, particularly from East Asia and Japan. Mr. Sugimoto's reach is long, and his range is broad, from fossils to textiles to undersea dioramas to Japanese calligraphy to the Trylon and Perisphere (a minisculpture) that symbolized the New York World's Fair of 1939. It may not be all that enlightening, but as an artist's personal survey, it comes off. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Glueck).</p>
        <p>*JEWISH MUSEUM: 'THE JEWISH IDENTITY PROJECT: NEW AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHY,' through Jan. 29. Who's Jewish, who isn't, and by the way, what is a Jew anyway? They are not easy questions, as this intense who-are-we exploration makes clear. Ten projects by 13 artists try to help break the stereotype of American Jews as uniformly white, middle-class and of European descent. Using photography and video, they have interpreted their missions broadly, from the Korean-born Nikki S. Lee's meticulous staging of a Jewish wedding with herself as the bride to Andrea Robbins and Max Becher's look at the thriving shtetl established by Lubavitcher Hasidic Jews in the rural community of Postville, Iowa. Refugees from the Holocaust, Jews of color, those of various sexual orientations, an extended Iranian family, a convert to Judaism reared as a Roman Catholic and others are seen and heard in this lively show, which broadens the universe of Jews in this country. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street (212)423-3200. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE BISHOP JADES,' through Feb. 12. Jade has been treasured since ancient times, though the almost preposterously exquisite objects on display in the Met's reinstalled galleries for Chinese decorative arts date from the 18th century, when the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) brought Chinese jade work to a peak of virtuosity. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'THE (S) FILES/THE SELECTED FILES 05,' through Jan. 29. The definition of what ''Latino art'' means is changing in a post-identity-politics time, and this modest biennial, drawn mostly from unsolicited proposals submitted by artists in the greater New York area, is an indicator of what that change looks like. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212)831-7272. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'NEW YORK CHANGING: DOUGLAS LEVERE REVISITS BERENICE ABBOTT'S NEW YORK,' through Nov. 13. During the 1930's, the Modernist photographer Berenice Abbott photographed the architectural fabric of New York with a keen eye for contrasts of new and old. Between 1997 and 2003, Douglas Levere returned to the scenes that she photographed and photographed them again. Seeing 50 of his paired with her originals is a fascinating education in how things change. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212)534-1672. (Ken Johnson)</p>
        <p>* STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'SCRATCH: 2004-2005 ARTISTS IN RESIDENCE: WILLIAM CORDOVA, MICHAEL QUEENLAND AND MARC ANDRE ROBINSON,' through Oct. 23 . Rap, religion, Minimalism and Malcolm X all figure in this intricate, multilayered show of work by the three young residents, organized by the museum's associate curator, Christine Y. Kim. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>*WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'OSCAR BLUEMNER: A PASSION FOR COLOR,' through Feb. 12. Not exactly a well-known name today, except to devotees of American Modernism, this German-born architect-turned-painter (1867-1938) was in fact one of the major American artists of the early 20th century, right up there with the likes of Marsden Hartley, John Marin, Arthur Dove and Charles Demuth, to name a few. Most of his compositions are unpeopled landscapes depicting houses and building fragments in brilliantly stylized settings in which trees, clouds, smokestacks, telephone poles, water and snow are rendered as rhythmic and dramatic shapes that play off one another almost musically. Too, he was a superb colorist, assigning psychological properties to each color, red in particular, which he considered symbolic of power and energy. Among the best works here are his last ones, landscapes that have the magic of Expressionist theater, with houses, trees and the like assuming almost human presences. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3676. (Glueck) *WHITNEY MUSEUM: ROBERT SMITHSON, through Oct. 23. Who knows whether Smithson is the most influential American postwar artist, as this show claims. Consisting mostly of drawings, photographs and films (he didn't make many sculptures, not ones that could fit into a museum, anyway), this is the first full-scale overview of him in the country. It is consequently dry but still compelling testimony to a great exuberance cut drastically short when Smithson died at 35 in a plane crash in 1973. (See above.)(Michael Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Uptown</p>
        <p>*ADAM DANT: 'STANDING UNDER' An extraordinarily imaginative and skillful draftsman, Mr. Dant makes large pen-and-brush drawings of complex scenes populated by chunky little people, all viewed as if from below through a transparent ground or floor. Adam Baumgold, 74 East 79th Street, (212)861-7338, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>'VIETNAM: DESTINATION FOR THE NEW MILLENNIUM -THE ART OF DINH Q. LE' Born in Vietnam, Mr. Le moved to the United States at age 11 and received a master of fine arts degree from the School of Visual Arts in New York. This small exhibition presents high-concept photographic and sculptural works about the Vietnam War and its effects, as well as a pair of sleek sculptures representing communications satellites that satirize Vietnam's plans to enter the space age and the global consumerist economy. Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212)288-6400, through Jan. 15. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Galleries: 57th Street</p>
        <p>HENRY WOLF Organized by the photography critic Vince Aletti, this exhibition presents works by the suave art director, designer and photographer Henry Wolf (1925-2005). Examples of his designs for magazine covers and pictures by photographers that he commissioned are on view, but the most interesting part is the selection of Wolf's noncommercial photographs, which are compelling for their ultramodern ways with light, multiple spaces, speed and glamour. Howard Greenberg, 41 East 57th Street, (212)334-0010, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>*ROBERT BORDO A beautiful, quietistic show by a painter whose work always manages to be both grounded and ethereal, soundless and resonant, abstract and not. Mr. Bordo is at midcareer. The time for a retrospective view is at hand. Alexander and Bonin, 132 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, (212)367-7474, through Oct. 22. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>'LANDSCAPE: MYTH AND MEMORY' Miniature ruins built of tiny bricks on rocky landscapes made of clay by Charles Simmonds; large, faux antique photographs of Egyptian pyramids by Lynn Davis; an enormous, crusty book by Anselm Kiefer open to the photographic image of ancient architectural remains; and archetypal circles painted and photographed by Richard Long all add up to a nicely choreographed collective fantasy about primordial civilizations. Senior &amp; Shopmaker, 21 East 26th Street, (212)213-6767, through Nov. 23. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>NICK MAUSS This fleet, stylish show has a muffled cries-and-whispers sense of mystery. The small paintings and drawings suggest hurried sketches and half-erased images from a suppressed larger narrative. The tites of two paintings, ''Urgent'' and ''Paraphrase,'' sum up the dynamic. Daniel Reich, 537 A West 23rd Street, (212)924-4949, through Oct. 22. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>SUE WILLIAMS Few artists have combined figurative abstract painting and existential disgust as variously and effectively as Sue Williams has, and the trajectory continues in this show of new work. Here the battered body parts and de Kooning-esque swipes of the past have been distilled into a tumorous universe of genitals, anuses and noxious emissions, as the biological becomes political. 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, (212)255-1121, through Oct. 29. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Other Galleries</p>
        <p>CLAIRE FONTAINE Politically charged works by this French artist include a neon-light work that outlines the image of a hooded Iraqi prisoner and child; a neon sign in the gallery's front window that says in Arabic, ''Foreigners Everywhere''; and a tiny sculpture called ''In God We Trust'' in the form of a 25-cent coin with a fold-out box cutter secreted inside. Reena Spaulings, 371 Grand Street, SoHo, (212)477-5006, through Oct. 21. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>VIOLA FREY: 'A LASTING LEGACY' This show of the last ceramic sculptures of Viola Frey (1933-2004) is dominated by outsize figures, among them a standing man more than 10 feet tall and a goddesslike seated nude more than 6 feet high, both in white-glazed clay. Although they are untouched by color, a number of slightly earlier works blaze with her usual painterly panache, like the brilliant orange hands and tie, yellow shirt and multicolored face she gave to the large ''Seated Man, Foot Poised on World,'' who seems to kick away a globe in anger or frustration. Nancy Hoffman Gallery, 429 West Broadway, (212)431-3600, through Oct 25. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>*ANDRÉ KERTESZ From tiny, wonderfully intense pictures made in the teens in Budapest, where Kertesz was born in 1894, to formally acute views of Paris in the 20's and 30's to emotionally and metaphorically resonant images of New York, where he lived from 1936 to his death in 1985, this beautiful exhibition covers the career of a giant of 20th-century photography. International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000, through Nov. 27. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>*MACCHINE NATURALI: 'ABSTRACT COLLAGES BY JOSEPH STELLA' The largest New York show in some time of Stella's elegant, understated collages, made from dirt-stained scraps of paper, can thoroughly rearrange your grasp of his sensibility and the history of American Modernism. Peter Freeman Inc., 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo (212)966-5349, through Oct. 29. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>*Diane Arbus: 'Other Faces, Other Rooms' If you think you are sufferingfrom Diane Arbus fatigue, this exhibition of 49 photographs that have not been widely published or exhibited will surely refresh your interest. Robert Miller, 524 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)366-4774, closing tomorrow.(Johnson)</p>
        <p>*TOM BURCKHARDT: 'FULL STOP'  A painter of eclectically layered abstractions has produced a surprising environmental installation: a slightly old-fashioned, fully equipped painter's studio made of brown corrugated cardboard and black paint. Caren Golden, 539 West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212)727-8304, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>WOUTER DERUYTTER: 'CROW WARRIORS' You could almost mistake Mr. Deruytter's black-and-white, subtly erotic photographs of Crow Indian warriors in face paint, feathered headdresses and loin cloths, riding bareback horses, for 19th-century ethnographic documents. In fact, they depict contemporary American Indians gathered for an annual re-enactment of the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Briggs Robinson, 527 West 29th Street, (212)560-9075, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>*OMER FAST: 'GODVILLE' Video editing is virtuosic medium in Omer Fast's hands, and history a malleable, volatile subject composed of flickering bits and pieces, as seen in this two-channel installation shot in Colonial Williamsburg, a Revolution-era reconstruction where docents dressed in 18th-century clothes, play period roles. Postmasters, 459 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)727-3323, closing tomorrow. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>*MONIQUE PRIETO AND LYNDA BENGLIS Ms. Prieto has, in effect, boarded over her abstract paintings with rough-hewn monolithic letters quoting Samuel Pepys's diary. Both the wordiness and the klunkiness are a bit familiar, but extracting Pepys's phrases, which are all deliberately disembodied in reference, can be strangely satisfying. In ''The Graces,'' Ms. Benglis continues to evoke figures by other means, in this case three shimmering stacks of vaselike forms made of heavily textured, lavender-tinted resin. The material is perfect for the process-oriented Ms. Benglis. Cheim &amp; Read, 547 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-7727, closing tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>'RUSSIA REDUX NO.1' Organized by Elena Sorokina, this show of work by a dozen contemporary artists and artists' collectives from the former Soviet Union is a supplement and critical rejoinder to the celebratory, Putin-power national portrait presented in ''Russia!'' at the Guggenheim Museum. Schroeder Romero, 173A N. Third Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)486-8992, closing on Monday. . A second exhibition organized by Ms. Sorokina is at Momenta Art, 72 Berry St., Williamsburg, also closing on Monday. (Cotter)</p>
