        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''A Way to Trace Bullets'' (editorial, Oct. 17), you point out that President Bush ''needs to lead'' on the issue of creating a ''computerized national system for tracing bullets and cartridge casings to the guns that fired them.''</p>
        <p>You're right, but he won't do it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush says there needs to be a study first, even though the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms stated that ''numerous violent crimes involving firearms have been solved through use of the system.''</p>
        <p>How many re-studies are already in the Bush pipeline? Mainstream scientists concluded long ago that global warming was a reality, but that was not good enough for the Bush team; they must study it again.</p>
        <p>And so it will go with ballistic fingerprinting. It works, but that is not proof enough for Mr. Bush.</p>
