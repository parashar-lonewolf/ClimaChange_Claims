        <p>IT's a humble plant, with fuzzy green leaves that smell like lemons, and it doesn't even bloom. But citrosa -- Pelargonium citrosum Van Leenii, to be exact -- is a new, genetically engineered plant that puts out a perfume so powerful, mosquitoes get too confused to play vampire.</p>
        <p>Or so its growers say.</p>
        <p>"It interferes with their sensory apparatus, and they can't tell where you are," said Steve Griffith, an owner of Griffith Greenhouses , a nursery in Apopka, Fla., with American growing rights to the patented plant. Citrosa was developed in the Netherlands about five years ago but has been available here only since April.</p>
        <p>"You put out a flume of scent, which is mostly heat and carbon dioxide," Mr. Griffith said. "And when a mosquito flies through this flume, his antennae turn toward the higher concentration, and he tacks like a sailboat down this flume, until he finds you."</p>
        <p>Citrosa, which emits citronella oil, blocks the mosquito's radar device, the marketers say. But scientists say citronella, if it works at all, has nothing to do with blocking radar. Mosquitoes find the smell so irritating that it interrupts their feeding. They just hover about, until the repellent disperses; then they get back to biting.</p>
        <p>When scientists scratched beneath the surface of citrosa, they found just as many mosquito bites as ever.</p>
        <p>"Canadian scientists did a preliminary study at the University of Guelph in Ontario because there were so many inquiries from growers," said Carl Schreck, an entomologist with the United States Department of Agriculture's research service in Gainesville, Fla. "But they found that when they put their arms in a cage with the plant, the mosquitoes bit them just as readily as without the plant. The advertising is quite misleading, and there's no scientific data to back it up."</p>
        <p>The Canadians put 85 mosquitoes in a 10-inch-square Plexiglas cage and stuck their arms inside. Without the plant, one volunteer was bitten 40 times in 30 seconds. Then the plant went in for half an hour. Average bites in 30 seconds: 26.</p>
        <p>"Which is a reduction," Mr. Schreck conceded. But after the plant had been inside for an hour, the average was 43 bites, he said, and after 24 hours, 61 bites.</p>
        <p>Hmmm.</p>
        <p>There was some reduction when researchers crushed citrosa leaves and rubbed them over their hands: 12 bites. But hands rubbed with crushed lemon thyme got only 6.5 bites. "Sounds like they ought to be selling lemon thyme," Mr. Schreck said.</p>
        <p>He stressed that the study was preliminary. "It's not the kind of test I would go to court with, but researchers just wanted to see if the plant was giving off something that would repel mosquitoes," he said. "But it showed there was nothing present in the atmosphere of the cage that would prevent them from biting."</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, citrosa is a hot item in mosquito land. It's a greenie's dream: how to wage war on blood suckers the natural way.</p>
        <p>"We had a couple thousand in early spring, and I only have about 30 left," said Phil Van Bourgondien, owner of Fraser's Greenhouse, Florist and Garden Center in Quogue, L.I. Mr. Van Bourgondien sends the plants free to outdoor parties, hoping to entice unbitten guests.</p>
        <p>"We brought down 40 or 50 plants to a party down on Dune Road, on the beach, on the Fourth of July, where historically, people are eaten alive," he said. "This year nobody complained at all about the insects, and they bought up my supply. I've ordered a couple thousand more."</p>
        <p>And if nudists say it works, does science barely matter?</p>
        <p>"We put about two dozen plants around our outside pool bar this summer, and we're very happy to find that they do work," said James Hadley of the Cypress Cove Nudist Resort in Kissimmee, Fla. "We needed something in the evening hours when the mosquitoes come out."</p>
        <p>He went on: "They are a repellent, but sometimes a mosquito gets through the barrier. So we advise people to shake the plant, to give off more aroma, and to run their hands across the leaves and then rub their legs."</p>
        <p>Mr. Griffith's assistants used to douse themselves with Skin So Soft, the odoriferous Avon bath oil that is so good at repelling mosquitoes that it is used in the Amazon jungle.</p>
        <p>"But since we got the plants in here -- and we have two acres of greenhouses -- we haven't needed it," he said. "Nobody has gotten bitten."</p>
        <p>The plant was developed by Dr. Dirk Van Leeni, a Dutch horticulturist. Through a process known as protoplast fusion, he combined the chromosones of a plant called the grass of China and a geranium from South Africa. The grass of China lends citrosa its ability to produce citronella and citral, both mosquito-repellent oils; the African geranium donated the fleshy leaves that release the bug-blocking fragrance.</p>
        <p>Citrosa is produced by PhytoNova, a subsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell that specializes in plant tissue culture. Austerica Inc., in Ontario, purchased the North American rights to the patented plant and arranged with Griffith Greenhouses to grow micro-cuttings to four-inch plants.</p>
        <p>Griffith has grown and sold 100,000 citrosa plants since April and plans to grow half a million next year. The plants are being distributed to retail nurseries in the New York area by Green Power Inc., of Manhattan, and Foliage and Stuff Greenhouses, in East Patchogue, L.I. Nurseries have to sign nonpropagating agreements, but consumers can make cuttings without going to jail.</p>
        <p>"It's no skin off my nose if customers make a few cuttings," said Gordon Horwitz, president of Austerica. "Make a few cuttings for next year and bring them inside for the winter."</p>
        <p>So let hard scientists keep sticking their hands in mosquito cages. The common folk are sitting, skeeter-free, by citrosa.</p>
        <p>"They're fabulous plants," said Lynn Norden, who lives in a Manhattan penthouse. "We eat outside all the time, and I put about seven on my terrace in April. I haven't seen a mosquito all summer. We used to have to use all kinds of citronella candles and incense sticks, and I don't use anything anymore."</p>
        <p>Mosquito-control officials are a bit skeptical about citrosa's performance in the wild but concede that the plant holds its own on a tame patio.</p>
        <p>"I've tried it out in the yard, and it doesn't work at all, because the wind carries the smell away," said George Alexander, director of mosquito control for Orange County, Fla. "But I have two plants on the stoop of my house, and I can smell them through the windows. It took the plants about two days to get established, but after that, the mosquitoes cleared out."</p>
        <p>Out in Yaphank, L. I., the Suffolk County Bureau of Vector Control is growing 10 plants in its lab. "When they get about a foot high, we'll put them out in the swamps and large mosquito breeding areas and set up a monitoring program," said Joseph Sanzone, superintendent. "Some traps get up to 200 mosquitoes a night, so we'll see if that changes."</p>
        <p>Mr. Sanzone said he would also be sending in volunteers -- with and without citrosa plants.</p>
        <p>"Want to volunteer?" he said. "You could get a Pulitzer for this."</p>
        <p>Along with the citrosa plant, of course, if it does the job.</p>
