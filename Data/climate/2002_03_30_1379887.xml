        <p>Hollis Price is a junior who looks like a freshman. He stands a little over 6 feet tall and supposedly weighs 165 pounds, but the skinny on Price is that his game at point guard for Oklahoma is much larger. He is calm and mature, factors that have helped push the Sooners (31-4) to 12 consecutive victories and into the Final Four against Indiana (24-11) on Saturday at the Georgia Dome.</p>
        <p>Today Price sat at a news conference with perfect posture and perfect poise, with his arms folded, and offered a presence comparable to that of a scientist at a Senate hearing on global warming. Everyone around Price says not to mistake his boyish looks for the intense fire that burns underneath.</p>
        <p>Soon that was apparent.</p>
        <p>Someone asked him about this Oklahoma team being built on defense and rebounding and whether all of the Sooners easily accepted these staples instead of insisting on a flashier style of play. ''The guys that have been here for a while knew what we had to do,'' Price said. ''The new guys had to be convinced. I tried to do my part to make sure that wasn't a problem.''</p>
        <p>Someone asked him about Indiana guard Tom Coverdale's sprained ankle and if he understood Coverdale's angst.</p>
        <p>''I do to a certain degree,'' Price said. ''But I didn't get to play again after my injury. He gets the chance to play again tomorrow -- and hopefully, that's it.''</p>
        <p>This is a guy with killer instincts.</p>
        <p>His injury and rehabilitation last year helped him develop that.</p>
        <p>He played much of last season with a pulled groin muscle. In Oklahoma's first-round loss to Indiana State at the N.C.A.A. tournament, Price collided with an opponent and nearly severed the ulnar nerve in his shooting arm. The collision was so severe that a tooth fragment was stuck in his arm.</p>
        <p>He had three operations, the last one in March, and could not shoot a basketball freely until August.</p>
        <p>''He couldn't shoot a 3-point basket until August, but once he got healthy, he took 500 shots a day; most guys in that situation would shoot it 200 to 300 times a day,'' Oklahoma Coach Kelvin Sampson said. Sampson has called Price ''as good a human being as I've been around.''</p>
        <p>Sampson added: ''Hollis is just a doer. Some guys talk about it, but Hollis does it. He has a clear understanding of what our program is. We have great player leadership and that's what it takes for teams to reach their potential.''</p>
        <p>Especially to reach the Final Four. The Sooners know because they have averaged 24.3 victories in each of the last four seasons but are playing in their first Final Four since losing the national championship game in 1988. They have reached this stage, in part, because a renewed Price has been their floor general.</p>
        <p>''Hollis brings a tenacity to our team that a lot of teams don't have,'' the senior forward Aaron McGhee said. ''Most of the time he's guarding the best player on the perimeter and does a good job.''</p>
        <p>And that is whether he is passing, shooting, running the offense, defending, rebounding, whatever the Sooners need. Often you can find Price on the floor, the little guy being knocked down or diving for loose balls, always getting up for more.</p>
        <p>In this tournament, in Oklahoma victories over Illinois-Chicago (71-63), Xavier (78-65), Arizona (88-67) and Missouri (81-75), Price has averaged 32.8 minutes and 18.3 points a game, and has 9 assists and 6 steals. He has made 12 3-point shots and 11 of 12 free throws (91.7 percent).</p>
        <p>Price knows that Indiana enters Saturday's game with a hot hand.</p>
        <p>''I watched Indiana against Kent State shoot 15 for 19 in 3-pointers and some teams don't make 15 of 19 free throws,'' Price said. ''That's important that we recognize their ability there. We've played against teams with great inside-outside presence, and Kansas comes to mind as a team like that.''</p>
        <p>Oklahoma beat Kansas, a Final Four team, 64-55, in the Big 12 tournament championship game. It has a victory this season over another Final Four team, Maryland, by 72-56.</p>
        <p>As good as Price has been, he has not been recognized nationally. He made none of the top three all-American teams and in those polls was not even mentioned in the section for others receiving votes. Price, however, was named the most valuable player of the West Regional.</p>
        <p>''I've really worked hard on my shooting and it's paying off,'' Price said. ''We've made a lot of strides this year -- the whole program has. I always seem to be getting knocked to the floor, but in this game you've got to be tough and keep a level head.''</p>
        <p>Price does that. The rest of the Sooners follow.</p>
