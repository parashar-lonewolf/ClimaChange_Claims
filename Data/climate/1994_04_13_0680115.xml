        <p>When Bennett Brown graduated from M.I.T. two years ago with an A average, he could have worked anywhere.

        <p>When Bennett Brown graduated from M.I.T. two years ago with an A average, he could have worked anywhere. He'd done research on cancer and artificial intelligence and was published as a sophomore. ("At one point I was interested in growing neurons," he said.) He scored perfect 800's on the G.R.E.'s.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Brown was also interested in science education. His thesis was on how to build an oscilliscope for classroom use for $20 from an old Sony Watchman TV ("Yeah, I did it," he said, yanking it from a drawer. "It'd cost $3,000 to buy one new.")</p>
        <p>For six months after graduation, he worked for a Cambridge company developing science equipment for elementary and secondary classes. He designed a machine that measures the ozone layer, sells for $150 and is now used in 300 schools. He enjoyed it, but something was missing. "More technology is not the solution," he said. "I feel our technology has gotten ahead of us. We have to make better use of what we have." Plus, he was raised in an Iowa family where a social conscience was valued.</p>
        <p>So when his girlfriend was accepted at the University of Chicago medical school 1992, Mr. Brown applied to teach at DuSable High School, long considered one of Chicago's worst. He wanted a challenge. DuSable is near the Robert Taylor Homes, perhaps the city's toughest housing project, a haven for violent gangs; 80 percent of DuSable kids are on welfare.</p>
        <p>A new principal, Charles Mingo, has won national attention for beginning to turn DuSable around, but even he admits there's a long way to go. He has reduced the dropout rate -- to 51 percent from 73 percent.</p>
        <p>One of many problems is the teaching staff he inherited. The school had long been a dumping ground, and one-third of the teachers do a poor job, he said. The principal escorted a reporter from science class to science class with 15 minutes left in a recent school day. Virtually all the teachers had finished teaching. One class was doing crossword puzzles, one was decorating a bulletin board. "You see what I'm up against," Mr. Mingo said.</p>
        <p>In the summer of '92 Mr. Brown had four job offers from private schools, but turned them down in hopes of getting DuSable. The DuSable principal used his connections in the city bureaucracy, and on the third day of the '92 school year he was finally able to hire Mr. Brown -- as a substitute.</p>
        <p>That first year, Mr. Brown worked 60 hours a week teaching physics and chemistry and was named one of the 100 best new teachers in America by a national student-aid group, the Student Loan Marketing Association.</p>
        <p>The other day Mr. Brown arrived at 7:15 A.M. to set up a physics lab on computer circuitry. "I've got something that will really wow them," he said. Class started at 8:23, though not one of his 28 students was there. "I try not to take it too personally," Mr. Brown said. "It can get you down, you know."</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown isn't sure if attendance has been so bad lately because of spring weather or the gang wars. Six Chicago children were killed the week before Easter. Parents have been keeping children indoors.</p>
        <p>At 8:34, when Mr. Brown started the lab, seven students were present; eventually 12 arrived, only one a boy. Mr. Brown began with review questions, handing out tickets to anyone who answered ("or gets close or just shows some enthusiasm"). They can trade tickets for fruit or other food that he brings in.</p>
        <p>The lab was on combinational logic. "I want you to draw a NAND gate and get a truth table for a NAND gate," Mr. Brown said. "You need five wires, two jumper cables, your circuit boards and batteries."</p>
        <p>"Mr. Brown!" "Mr. Brown!" "Mr. Brown!"</p>
        <p>"O.K., Sherrice, one second," Mr. Brown said.</p>
        <p>"Mr. Brown, where that NAND gate at?" asked Angel Green.</p>
        <p>They raced to finish, so the red bulb on their circuit boards would light. Sherrice Dotson got hers first. "Hurry, Mr. Brown," said Tuesday Anderson. "I'm lost and we only got 10 minutes."</p>
        <p>Sherrice helped Elesia Martin. The girls became friendly during the science fair this year. There are a dozen science teachers at DuSable; Mr. Brown's students accounted for one-third of the entries in the school fair. Four girls, including Sherrice and Elesia, went onto the next level, the district fair, spending two weeks after school until past 7 P.M., preparing.</p>
        <p>"Sherrice is the kind of girl," Mr. Brown said, "who will read a meter stick to .05. She'll say it's '60.75.' That's very unusual for a high school student."</p>
        <p>"We lit!" yelled Paula Galmore.  "We lit!"</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown said, "We have two minutes."</p>
        <p>"I'm getting it," Tuesday said, but then the bell rang. Mr. Brown said they'd finish next day.</p>
        <p>Last year the school day was divided into seven 40-minute periods (a 280-minute school day). For his labs, Mr. Brown had back-to-back periods -- 80 minutes. This year, to save money and cut teachers, all Chicago schools were ordered to convert to five 50-minute periods. Mr. Brown has just 50 minutes for labs now. It is not enough for him..</p>
        <p>He rushed to prepare a chemistry lab on calculating the speed of chemical reactions at varying degrees of dilution in water. There were eight in this class. Mr. Brown was confused about why the times for Ann Platt's experiments were so different from the rest of the class, until he watched her time a reaction that took 65 seconds.</p>
        <p>"How long was that?" he asked, and Ann said, "About 20." He asked her how much time elapses when the second hand on a clock goes from the 12 to the 1. "One second?" answered the high school junior.</p>
        <p>"How many seconds in a minute?" asked Mr. Brown. Ann didn't know. Mr. Brown was frozen for a moment, then recovered. "O.K., 60 seconds in a minute," he said casually. "Don't ever forget that anybody."</p>
