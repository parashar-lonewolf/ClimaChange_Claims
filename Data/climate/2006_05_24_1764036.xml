        <p>Letter from Elisabeth Drake, Michael Golay and Jefferson Tester of MIT says Clean Energy Transition endorsed by Katherine Ellison's May 20 Op-Ed is postive step but seriously underestimates scale and types of changes needed to mitigateglobal warming</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Katherine Ellison is indignant about the ineffectiveness of the political establishment in mitigating global warming. But her endorsement of the Clean Energy Transition, with its narrow emphasis upon currently deployable renewable technologies, is also equally ineffective, because these technologies are now too small in output or too localized, and are often not competitive in today's energy markets without subsidy.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Katherine Ellison is indignant about the ineffectiveness of the political establishment in mitigating global warming. But her endorsement of the Clean Energy Transition, with its narrow emphasis upon currently deployable renewable technologies, is also equally ineffective, because these technologies are now too small in output or too localized, and are often not competitive in today's energy markets without subsidy.</p>
        <p>The Clean Energy Transition agenda is a positive step, but it seriously underestimates the scale and types of changes needed.</p>
        <p>In our energy course at M.I.T, we teach that an effective attack upon global warming requires the use of a large portfolio that includes all of the available non-carbon-emitting energy supply technologies, like the two that are now available at industrial strength: nuclear and hydro power.</p>
        <p>This portfolio also includes making large improvements in energy efficiency over all, plus progress toward increasing other renewables, like wind, biomass and geothermal.</p>
        <p>Attacking global climate change is a tough problem, made needlessly difficult by the current, almost exclusive reliance upon market mechanisms to achieve change and by the rigid refusal of some in the green lobby to seek realistic solutions.</p>
