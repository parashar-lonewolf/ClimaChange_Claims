        <p>New Law Raises Fears of Undersea Plunder</p>
        <p>A change in Greek law governing access by divers to coastal waters has raised fears that ancient shipwrecks will become prey to thieves bent on archaeological plunder, The Guardian of London reported. Under the new legislation enacted by Parliament, divers who previously had access to only 620 miles of the 10,000 miles of Greek coastline will be able to explore ships and ''archaeological parks'' freely. ''Looting is a big danger,'' said Katerina Delaporta, in charge of the department of marine antiquity of the Greek Ministry of Culture. ''The sea is not like a museum. It can't be guarded around the clock, and unfortunately technology has no principles.'' Dimitris Athanasoulis, president of the Archaeologists' Association, said: ''There are treasures in our seas. This will open the floodgates to smugglers.''</p>
        <p>Start of an Era at La Scala</p>
        <p>La Scala will raise the curtain tonight on a new season and a new era. After 19 years with Riccardo Muti as its music director, opening night at the opera house in Milan will feature the 30-year-old British conductor Daniel Harding leading a performance of ''Idomeneo,'' with Steve Davislim and Camilla Tilling, right, the first of four Mozart operas to be presented in observance of the 250th anniversary of Mozart's birth, Reuters reported. ''We're ready to begin a new chapter,'' said Stéphane Lissner, who became La Scala's artistic director in May after strikes forced out Mr. Muti and Mauro Meli, who had just been appointed general manager. Mr. Lissner announced last month that he planned to wait two years before appointing a successor to Mr. Muti.</p>
        <p>Opera in Washington</p>
        <p>The North American premiere of ''Sophie's Choice,'' by Nicholas Maw, will be a highlight of the 2006-7 season of the Washington National Opera. The opera, based on the 1979 novel by William Styron, will be performed Sept. 21 through Oct. 9, 2006, conducted by Marin Alsop. Plácido Domingo, left, the company's general director, who announced the season, will also star in a new production of Wagner's ''Walküre'' at the Kennedy Center Opera House. Directed by Francesca Zambello and conducted by the music director, Heinz Fricke, this presentation, from March 24 through April 17, 2007, will continue the company's ''Ring'' cycle.</p>
        <p>Works in Progress</p>
        <p>The producer Steven Bochco and Callie Khouri, the Oscar-winning screenwriter of ''Thelma &amp; Louise,'' are teaming to develop ''Hollis and Rae,'' an ABC drama about two women, lifelong best friends in their 30's, a police officer and a prosecutor, who take on cases in the South, Reuters reported. The project received a go-ahead from the network on Monday.  Leonardo DiCaprio, above, who arrived at the Oscar ceremonies in a hybrid car and has lobbied for worldwide access to clean water, is making a feature-length documentary about global environmental issues, The Associated Press reported. The film, ''11th Hour,'' explores global warming and offers solutions for restoring ecosystems, according to Ken Sunshine, a spokesman for Mr. DiCaprio. The film is to be released next fall.</p>
        <p>$20 Million in Arts Grants</p>
        <p>The National Endowment for the Arts announced yesterday that it would award $20.4 million to 844 recipients in the coming fiscal year. Through its Access to Artistic Excellence grants, $19.4 million will finance 794 projects for museums and local arts agencies and in dance, design, folk and traditional arts, literature, music, musical theater, opera and the visual arts. Through Literature Fellowships, 50 writers of fiction and nonfiction are to receive $20,000 each. Among them is Terrence Cheng of New York, who will use his award to travel to China and Japan to conduct research for a novel.</p>
        <p>Footnotes</p>
        <p>Dawn Upshaw has dropped out of a concert scheduled for 7:30 tonight at Zankel Hall. She will be replaced by Hyunah Yu. Carnegie Hall announced that Ms. Upshaw was suffering from a severe cold. Part of the program of works by Haydn and Mozart has been changed.  ''Good Night, and Good Luck,'' the George Clooney film about Edward R. Murrow's war of words and images with Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, will be honored by the Producers Guild of America with its 2006 Stanley Kramer Award, The Associated Press reported. The accolade, for motion pictures that illuminate social issues, will be accepted by Grant Heslov, the film's producer and co-writer, at the guild's annual awards ceremony on Jan. 22 in Los Angeles.</p>
