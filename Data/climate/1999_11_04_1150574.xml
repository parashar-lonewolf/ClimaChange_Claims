        <p>THE AMERICAS</p>
        <p>CANADA: NEW CHIEF JUSTICE  Prime Minister Jean Chretien named Beverley McLachlin chief justice of the Supreme Court. She is the first woman to hold the position. Ms. McLachlin, who has served on the court for a decade, has been called an egalitarian jurist and a radical feminist. In a September decision, Ms. McLachlin wrote that an aerobics test that led to the firing of a woman as a firefighter was discriminatory. In a July decision she barred a boy from suing his mother for prenatal injuries. The conservative Canada Family Action Coalition, denounced the appointment.</p>

        <p>MEXICO: FINAL POLLS FAVOR LABASTIDA  Final opinion polls before the governing party's presidential primary on Sunday showed Francisco Labastida Ochoa, a former interior minister who is the candidate of the party establishment, leading Roberto Madrazo Pintado, a maverick former governor running as a rebel. In personal interviews with the Reforma newspaper, 34 percent of 2,540 registered voters in all 32 states supported Mr. Labastida and 28 percent backed Mr. Madrazo. The margin of error was 2 percentage points.</p>

        <p>MEXICO: A MEETING OF TOP JUDGES  The chief justice of Mexico's 10-member Supreme court, Genaro Gongora Pimentel, visited Washington to meet with his American counterpart, Justice William H. Rehnquist. The Mexican high court has traditionally been subordinate to the country's all-powerful presidents, with some presidents simply dismissing justices whose opinions they have disliked. Mr. Gongora is seeking to modernize the Mexican system.</p>

        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>GERMANY: U.S. IN CLASH ON GLOBAL WARMING  At a 150-nation conference in Bonn, the United States clashed with the European Union and developing countries over how and when to ratify an anti-pollution accord reached two years ago in Kyoto, Japan. Environment ministers were deeply split over the issue of how pollution could be cut without hurting economic growth. The European Union and Japan want a global warming accord in place by 2002, but the United States declined to set a deadline.</p>

        <p>LITHUANIA: PREMIER APPROVED  Parliament endorsed its conservative deputy chairman, Andrius Kubilius, 43, as the new prime minister, putting an end to weeks of political turmoil. He was nominated by President Valdas Adamkus after Rolandas Paksas resigned in protest at the privatization of the Mazeikiai oil refinery.</p>

        <p>SERBIA: U.S. SHIFT OFFICIAL  The Clinton administration, in a move to support political opposition to President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, confirmed it would lift economic sanctions on Serbia if free elections were held there. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright was joined by eight opposition leaders as she made the announcement in Washington. The administration previously said sanctions would remain until Mr. Milosevic left office or was ousted. Officials in Belgrade denounced the plan as interference in Serbia's internal affairs.</p>

        <p>BRITAIN: PORTILLO LOOKS TO COMMONS  Michael Portillo, the former defense secretary who lost his Commons seat in 1997, has become the Conservative candidate in a secure Tory London district and is certain to return to Parliament in a by-election next month. He is widely seen as a stronger potential leader of the party than its current head, William Hague.</p>

        <p>NORTHERN IRELAND: MITCHELL REPORTS  George J. Mitchell discussed his nine-week-old effort to rescue the stalled Ulster peace accord with Prime Minister Tony Blair at 10 Downing Street and then left for Washington to brief President Clinton. The former United States senator adjourned the talks after they failed to end a deadlock over guerrilla disarmament and will reconvene them Monday in Belfast.</p>

        <p>UNITED NATIONS</p>
        <p>COUNCIL CRITICIZED ON WAR CRIMES  The departing president of the United Nations war crimes tribunal in The Hague said the Security Council was doing too little to help bring indicted people to justice. In a letter to the Council, Gabrielle Kirk McDonald said requests for help made by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia were too often ignored. States in the former Yugoslavia are shielding indicted men, refusing to recognize the jurisdiction of the tribunal and refusing to admit investigators, she said.</p>

        <p>ZIMBABWE: DOCTORS END STRIKE  Doctors in state-run hospitals ended a six-week strike after the government assured them that their concerns over pay and working conditions would be addressed. The action by hundreds of physicians forced major hospitals to send many patients home. The doctors, who say they earn the equivalent of about $160 a month, have been promised a significant pay raise by next year.</p>

        <p>SOUTH AFRICA: PRISON CHIEF QUITS IN SCANDAL  The head of the country's prison system resigned amid accusations that he used government money to sponsor a soccer club and pay for a scholarship program in his name at his alma mater, Jackson State University in Mississippi. President Thabo Mbeki, who has vowed to curb government corruption, had been under pressure to dismiss the official, Khulekani Sitole.</p>

        <p>ALGERIA: AMNESTY FOR 6,000  The authorities have freed 167 Muslim militants in a presidential amnesty for more than 6,000 prisoners, the official Algerian news agency reported. The agency said the amnesty for 6,683 detainees marked the 45th anniversary of the Nov. 1 revolution, the start of Algeria's war of independence against France.</p>

        <p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
        <p>JORDAN: DECISION ON JOURNALISTS  In a reversal, the Jordanian Press Association has decided not to expel three members who visited Israel in September or to ban them from working, the head of the association said. The move to punish the three was approved by the group's board on Oct. 19. The three, from Arabic-language dailies and the English-language Jordan Times, have repeatedly said their visit, at the invitation of Haifa University, were exercises of ''personal freedoms.''</p>

        <p>IRAQ: U.S. JETS ATTACK  American warplanes attacked Iraqi air-defense sites after coming under fire during routine patrols of the northern Iraq no-flight zone, the United States military said. The planes targeted artillery sites northwest of Bashiqah and north of Tall Afar, the European Command said in a statement. The jets, based in Incirlik, in southern Turkey, left the area safely, the statement said.</p>

        <p>IRAQ: 7 DIE IN ATTACK ON DISSIDENTS  Iranian opposition forces at a base 30 miles north of Basra suffered heavy casualties in a explosion they say was caused by a missile fired from Iran. Iraq said ''a foreign state'' was responsible for the deaths of 7 Iranians and Iraqis and the wounding of 78, but did not name Iran or mention missiles. Iran denied responsibility.</p>

        <p>ASIA</p>
        <p>ARMENIA: BROTHER SUCCEEDS BROTHER  The brother of Armenia's assassinated prime minister was appointed to succeed him by President Robert Kocharyan. A spokesman said Aram Sarkisian, 38, would replace his older brother, Vazgen, who was gunned down with seven other top officials during a raid on Parliament a week ago. Aram Sarkisian is the director of a cement factory and has not been active in politics.</p>
        <p>(Reuters)</p>
        <p>SRI LANKA: REBELS PUSH ON  Tamil rebels overran several military posts in the north, killing hundreds of soldiers, an army official said. The rebels seemed to be driving the army south, a day after they stormed into Oddusudan, 155 miles north of Colombo, killing 150 soldiers.</p>
        <p>(AP)</p>
        <p>SOUTH KOREA: AIRLINE PUNISHED  The government banned Korean Air Lines from adding new international routes for one year, after American investigators said pilot error and cockpit confusion were the main causes of a 1997 jumbo jet crash in Guam that killed 228 people.</p>
