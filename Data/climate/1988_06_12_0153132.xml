        <p>LEAD: A PEACE plan to end the long war between the states over acid rain emerged last week, not from Washington, but from the Governors of two states that have led the opposing camps in the acid rain debate, New York and Ohio.</p>
        <p>A PEACE plan to end the long war between the states over acid rain emerged last week, not from Washington, but from the Governors of two states that have led the opposing camps in the acid rain debate, New York and Ohio.</p>
        <p>The plan, which calls for a sharp reduction in the pollution that causes acid rain and subsidies to help industry pay for the cleanup, has several controversial elements, including the imposition of fees on imported oil to help pay for the program. Congress is unlikely, therefore, to rush it into law.</p>
        <p>But the fact that the plan was negotiated by Governor Mario Cuomo of New York, where acid rain originating in the Midwest has done considerable damage to lakes and streams, and Gov. Richard Celeste of Ohio, the state that is the biggest source of the pollution that produces acid rain, represents an important break in the deadlock over Congressional legislation on the issue.</p>
        <p>New York Senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat, and Alfonse D'Amato, a Republican, praised the plan and said they would introduce legislation to implement its proposals. Republican Representative Sherwood Boehlert of New York said he would do likewise in the House.</p>
        <p>The plan would require steep reductions in pollution from coal-fired plants over the next 25 years. The burning of high-sulfur coal produces oxides of sulfur and nitrogen that change chemically as they rise through the atmosphere and then descend as acid rain, snow, fog or dust that destroys plant and animal life in sensitive lakes and streams. The proposal would cost about $1.8 billion a year, with polluters bearing about half the cost and the oil industry paying for most of the rest.</p>
        <p>But the deadlock over acid rain is only one element of a legislative stalemate that has persisted through the 1980's over proposals to amend and strengthen the Federal Clean Air Act. Legislation pending in Congress would require action not only to control acid rain, but to deal with other air pollution problems. Chief among them is the failure of many cities and counties to meet existing clean air standards. Another target is the uncontrolled emission of toxic pollutants by industry.</p>
        <p>The bills are languishing partly because of concern over the cost of further improvements in air quality and, many environmentalists say, the Reagan Administration's opposition to what it considers too much government control of private industry. Regional and local differences also play a role, as does continuing debate among environmentalists and industry representatives over the need for more stringent anti-pollution efforts.</p>
        <p>Democrats contend that the Administration is holding up action on anti-pollution efforts. But Republicans and some environmentalists say that Congress is to blame for inaction on the Clean Air Act.</p>
        <p>''I am getting a little tired of people pointing the finger at the Administration,'' said Mr. Boehlert, a leader among House Republicans pushing for acid rain legislation. ''I am disappointed in the Administration, too, but both the House and the Senate and every committee in both houses is in control of the Democrats and they haven't done anything.''</p>
        <p>Some environmentalists point at two Democrats, the Senate majority leader, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, and Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, as the main obstacles to action. They contend that Senator Byrd is blocking legislation to protect his state's mining industry, a major producer of hi-s-sulfur co. . Critics sayr.r. Dingell hasouought the leglalation because its tougher regulations on exhaust emissions would impose new costs on Michigan's auto industry.</p>
        <p>Senator Byrd said he supports cleaner air but that he is concerned with the ''staggering costs'' of the bill pending in the Senate, which was introduced by Senator George Mitchell of Maine. ''We need to find less disruptive strategies for achieving our environmental needs,'' Mr. Byrd said. Mr. Dingell, meanwhile, has denied that he has the power to block clean air legislation.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the Cuomo-Celeste accord was taken by some to be an indication that the logjam is breaking up, especially in light of several reasons why Congress may act within the next few months.</p>
        <p>One is a deadline for compliance with the ozone and carbon monoxide requirements of the Clean Air Act, which expires at the end of August. If no action is taken to extend the deadline, some 60 non-complying cities could be subject to economic sanctions, such as the withholding of Federal highway funds.</p>
        <p>Finally, Congressional opponents of a stronger Clean Air Act may be spurred into action by the fact that both likely Presidential candidates, Vice President Bush and Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, have been speaking out in favor of stricter environmental protection. If no action on clean air is taken this year, the next Congress, with the support of the new President, could enact even stronger requirements.</p>
