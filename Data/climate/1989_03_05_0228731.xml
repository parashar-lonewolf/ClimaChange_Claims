        <p>JUST two years ago when 31 nations met in Montreal and agreed to cut the production of chlorofluorocarbons in half by the turn of the century, the accord was hailed by environmentalists as an unprecedented example of international cooperation. Now, with evidence accumulating that the chemicals are indeed eroding the protective ozone layer, the United States and the members of the European Community are rushing to impose even more drastic measures.</p>
        <p>At a meeting beginning today in London, British officials had planned to persuade representatives from 112 countries to aim for a cut of 85 percent. They were upstaged days before the conference when the European Community said that by the year 2000 its members would stop producing the chemicals altogether.</p>
        <p>William K. Reilly, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, immediately called for the Bush Administration to match the European plan to speed up the fight against destruction of the ozone layer, which filters out ultraviolet light that can cause skin cancer and damage plants and animals. The United States and the European Community each account for about 35 percent of world chlorofluorocarbon production.</p>
        <p>The President quickly embraced the recommendation, perhaps providing a clue as to how much effect Mr. Reilly, the first career environmentalist to head the E.P.A., will have in shaping Government policy. Politically, though, the decision might not be that difficult. E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company, which makes 25 percent of all chlorofluorocarbons, has already said that it will stop producing them by 2000.</p>
        <p>This millennarian spirit is in sharp contrast to the late 1970's when Du Pont ran full-page advertisements opposing a ban on the chemicals, which are mostly used as refrigerants, solvents and to make plastic foam. As late as 1987 some officials of the Reagan Administration were reported to be discussing an alternative to industrial controls: a public relations campaign urging the use of sunglasses, sun screens and hats.</p>
        <p>Since then, a wealth of evidence against chlorofluorocarbons has persuaded the United States and more than 20 other countries to ratify the Montreal pact. In the past, a seasonal ozone hole over Antarctica might have reached as far north as Buenos Aires, Santiago and parts of Australia. Last month scientists reported signs that the same destructive chemical reactions are taking place in the Arctic.</p>
        <p>Though environmentalists are encouraged, reversing ozone destruction still promises to be difficult. Even if the chemicals were banned immediately it would take decades for atmospheric levels to drop to where they were in 1985.</p>
