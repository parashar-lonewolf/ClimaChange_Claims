      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Bono, the Irish rock star who doubles as a celebrity campaigner for aid to poor countries, recently introduced himself as ''the poor man's James Joyce or the thinking man's Perry Como.'' He might have added that he has become the conservative man's Mother Teresa.</p>
        <p>While plenty of stars align themselves with popular social causes, not so many align themselves with the Bush administration, which has opposed a global warming treaty and funds for international family planning that many left-leaning celebrities endorse. But there is no denying that Bono has a way with Republicans.</p>
        <p>''It's very unhip for both of us,'' he said of his links to conservatives. ''We have to take 'good guys' and 'bad guys' out of this and just have a dialogue.''</p>
        <p>Bono, the singer for the band U2, has repeatedly lobbied the White House to spend more to fight AIDS and to endorse United Nations goals to cut poverty in half by 2015.</p>
        <p>In February, he flew east to meet with with Condoleezza Rice, the National Security Adviser, to discuss measures to increase the amount of money rich countries devote to helping poor ones -- and Bono's terms for sharing the platform with Mr. Bush today.</p>
        <p>Bono bonded so well with the sometimes curmudgeonly Paul H. O'Neill, the Treasury secretary, that the two decided to tour Africa together in May. Jesse A. Helms, the crusty North Carolina Republican and a skeptic of foreign aid, said Bono changed his mind on granting debt relief to poor nations and increasing AIDS funding.</p>
        <p>''You can see the halo over his head,'' Mr. Helms said.</p>
        <p>Bono claims, and some administration officials say he deserves, some credit for prodding the White House to take a more energetic approach to stemming the spread of disease and economic malaise in Africa and other countries.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Neill said after a Group of 7 finance ministers meeting in Ottawa this year that he originally dismissed Bono as ''just another celebrity who wanted to use me.'' But Bono's command of details impressed him. ''He's serious,'' Mr. O'Neill said, adding that the Treasury Department has received about 20,000 e-mail messages from U2 fans pressing for more action on AIDS.</p>
        <p>Bono also appeared to get through to Mr. Bush, who told the singer and administration officials that AIDS in Africa was comparable to genocide, implying that fighting it has become a moral imperative. The president had not described AIDS in such dramatic terms before.</p>
        <p>''Those are words that make us complicit if we don't take action,'' Bono said in an interview.</p>
        <p>Asked if he felt the administration was using him to endorse proposals that will not deliver an immediate boost in aid, Bono acknowledged the possibility, but said he expected Mr. Bush to live up to his words.</p>
        <p>''I would quote from another Republican president, Reagan,'' he said. ''We are going to trust but verify.''</p>
