        <p>Just Like Chocolate</p>
        <p>The coup de grâce on a vanilla-frosted cake is chocolate curls, and home bakers know how easy they are to make. You just take a hunk of dark chocolate and a sharp knife, slice off a very thin layer and the chocolate curls back on itself.</p>
        <p>Researchers in Germany have now found a way to make nanotubes -- crystalline straws with diameters well under a millionth of a meter -- in a similar way. But they use an etching fluid, rather than a knife, to cause the nanotube material to peel off and curl.</p>
        <p>The scientists, from the Max Planck Institute for Solid-State Research in Stuttgart, first applied a layer of etchable material to a flat substrate. On top of this layer they deposited two extremely thin layers of different semiconductor crystals.</p>
        <p>The lattice constant -- that is, the distance between atoms in a crystal -- is different for these two materials, and the one with the larger constant is beneath the other. As long as they sit on the etchable material, these top layers remain flat. Once the etchable material is removed, however, the larger lattice constant of the bottom layer causes both layers to curl into a tube.</p>
        <p>The researchers, who reported on their work in the journal Nature, note that by precisely controlling the thickness of the semiconductor layers, the diameter of the tube can be controlled as well.</p>
        <p>As the field of nanotechnology develops, tubes like these may be used to carry fluids -- as a tiny pipette, say, or in a microsyringe.</p>
        <p>Quick Hit for Dinosaurs</p>
        <p>It is becoming increasingly accepted that some singular climate-altering event about 65 million years ago -- the impact of a comet or asteroid -- led to the mass extinctions that, among other things, wiped dinosaurs off the planet. But some people think the climate change could have been caused over a longer time by large-scale volcanic activity.</p>
        <p>New support for the ''quick hit'' theory comes from researchers at the California Institute of Technology, who along with an Italian colleague have analyzed isotopes of helium in clay sediments deposited at the time of the event, the boundary between the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods.</p>
        <p>Interplanetary dust, which falls on earth all the time, contains high levels of one isotope, helium-3. So the ratio of helium-3 to helium-4 in the sediments, known as the K-T boundary clays, gives a clue to the rate at which space dust fell over the time. The researchers' analysis, reported in the journal Science, showed that the rate was constant. Among other things, this showed that if a comet hit Earth, it was a lone object, not part of a comet shower (which would have been accompanied by more space dust).</p>
        <p>The concentration of helium-3 in the boundary clays also allowed the sedimentation rate to be determined. Taking that rate, and the known thickness of the clays, the researchers calculated the duration of the climate-changing event at about 10,000 years -- a blink of the eye in geologic terms. This is far more consistent with a large, sudden impact that quickly produced huge amounts of gas and dust than with mass volcanic activity, which would have produced climate-changing effects over a much longer period, perhaps 500,000 years.</p>
        <p>Balloon Test Is Cut Short</p>
        <p>NASA's second attempt at a full-scale test of a giant balloon that is designed as a low-cost platform for near-space experiments was less than a resounding success.</p>
        <p>Officials in Alice Springs, Australia, launched the stadium-size  balloon on Saturday, two weeks after a first test was aborted. The second test proceeded smoothly, and the balloon reached the desired altitude of 112,000 feet; the plan was for it to stay at that height for about two weeks.</p>
        <p>After about 24 hours, however, the balloon could no longer maintain pressure and the flight was ended. As yet there is no word on whether NASA plans to go ahead with its first operational flight at the end of the year, or whether more tests are needed.</p>
