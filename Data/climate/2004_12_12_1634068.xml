        <p>DECEMBER is synonymous with sparkling wine, and the New Year's weekend will keep bubbles flowing into earliest January.</p>
        <p>Though a sideline to East End producers' main business, which is white and red still wine, good local sparkling wine awaits celebrants islandwide.</p>
        <p>Some leading styles have become clearly defined over time: Lenz's and Pugliese's on the North Fork, and Wölffer's on the South Fork. This year, North Fork sparklers from Lieb Family Cellars, Martha Clara and Palmer were especially winning, and I recommend them.</p>
        <p>Lieb's refreshing, feather-light 2001 sparkling blanc de blanc ($35) surpasses the noteworthy 1994 edition, the first release of this stylish drink. The 2001 is made wholly from pinot blanc grapes, a specialty of Lieb's vineyards. Lieb's version is a rarity; most premium sparklers everywhere involve chardonnay, pinot noir and sometimes pinot meunier.</p>
        <p>Somehow I had long overlooked Palmer's sparkler, but encountered it for the first time, with surprise and pleasure, at a party at the Marriott Marquis in Times Square celebrating the reopening of its revolving 47th-floor restaurant, the View. At that event, the restaurant introduced a special tasting menu pairing New York wines and foods.</p>
        <p>Bob Palmer, the owner of Palmer Vineyards, said sparkling wine had long been sold in his tasting room but had never been treated as a big deal; it deserves promotion. Currently, the 2000 sparkling brut ($20), a blend of chardonnay and pinot blanc, is available.</p>
        <p>When last tasted in June, Martha Clara's nonvintage brut, a blend of chardonnay and pinot noir, was a terrific value at $19. At the time, I found the bouquet spicy, lightly tropical and slightly perfumed; the bubbles were tiny; the body, supple; the finish, tangy.</p>
        <p>When visiting Pugliese Vineyards, you are warmed by an old-fashioned family operation. The Pugliese blanc de blanc brut (currently the 2000, at $19) is a longtime favorite. In winter, it's for dinner guests; in summer, for picnics.</p>
        <p>Wölffer Estate's 2000 brut Christian Wölffer Cuvée ($29), last tasted in June, had a lemony flavor and a light, taut body that qualified it as a perfect aperitif and as a partner for surf cuisine. Roman Roth makes all his wines with food meals in mind.</p>
        <p>Age has enhanced Lenz's nifty 1996 Cuvée ($30). Made of 70 percent pinot noir and 30 percent chardonnay, ''it remains taut, muscular, biscuitlike and tangy, and it too shows a French tilt,'' I wrote in this column in midyear. It's still true.</p>
        <p>Lenz's No.2, some may say No.1, sparkling wine is its recently released 1991 R.D. (R.D. signifies recently disgorged, which means that the yeast, which has converted sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide bubbles, has been ejected from the bottles just before periodic releases over the years.)</p>
        <p>This funky, big-bodied, $50 white is yeasty and nutty; it has the fading, over-the-hill character that graying British connoisseurs adore. They call the style baritone Champagne.</p>
