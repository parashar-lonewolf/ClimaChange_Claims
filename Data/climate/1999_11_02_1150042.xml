        <p>Impact of Climate Change</p>
        <p>The effect of climate change on ecosystems is well known. In a region experiencing a drought, to take an obvious example, less flora is available for the fauna, which can cause populations of certain animals to decline.</p>
        <p>But climate change can also have a more indirect effect on an ecosystem, by altering the behavior of predators within it. The latest illustration of this is from a long-term study of wolves in Isle Royale National Park, an island sanctuary in Lake Superior.</p>

        <p>Impact of Climate Change</p>
        <p>The effect of climate change on ecosystems is well known. In a region experiencing a drought, to take an obvious example, less flora is available for the fauna, which can cause populations of certain animals to decline.</p>
        <p>But climate change can also have a more indirect effect on an ecosystem, by altering the behavior of predators within it. The latest illustration of this is from a long-term study of wolves in Isle Royale National Park, an island sanctuary in Lake Superior.</p>
        <p>The study, by a team of researchers led by two Norwegian biologists, shows that during harsh winters with more snow, wolves hunt in larger packs. This makes them more efficient hunters and is bad news for their favorite prey, moose. But what is bad for the moose is good for the vegetation: fewer moose means that more balsam fir saplings, the animal's main winter forage, survive.</p>
        <p>The researchers studied data collected over 40 years in the park. Their analysis, reported in the journal Nature, shows that average pack size ranged from 4.5 wolves during the mildest winters to 12 during the snowiest, as grown pups that would normally leave to seek mates stayed with the family instead. Larger packs killed up to three times more moose than smaller ones.</p>
        <p>The data showed there were fewer moose in the year after a snowy winter. And by studying tree rings, the researchers found that in those same years, growth of balsam fir saplings increased.</p>
        <p>Legacy of an Intruder</p>
        <p>Ecosystems can also be affected by the introduction of an aggressive, non-native species. Often the result is significant, as anyone who has spent hours chopping kudzu vine from fences and telephone poles can attest.</p>
        <p>But a new study by Canadian scientists suggests that even a seemingly innocuous alien invader can have a negative impact.</p>
        <p>The researchers studied crested wheatgrass, which has steadily supplanted native grasses in much of the northern Great Plains, often at the enthusiastic insistence of ranchers and government agencies. The grass was first imported from Siberia during the drought years of the Dust Bowl, and is still valued for its hardiness, long growing season and because it makes good hay.</p>
        <p>But the scientists, writing in the journal Ecology, show that all that crested wheatgrass appears to have reduced the quality of the soil. Analyzing samples from Grasslands National Park in Saskatchewan, the researchers found that soil under the wheat grass had significantly fewer nutrients and less organic material than soil under native varieties.</p>
        <p>The wheatgrass's root system is probably to blame. Wheatgrass develops only shallow root, devoting most of its energy to its above-ground shoots. Native grasses do not grow as tall, but their roots are more extensive, allowing for greater enrichment of the soil.</p>
        <p>Star Measuring</p>
        <p>NASA has chosen a United States Naval Observatory satellite to check out the neighborhood -- the galactic neighborhood.</p>
        <p>The craft, called the Full-Sky Astrometric Mapping Explorer, will carry a telescope to determine position, distance and other information about stars brighter than 15th magnitude. Stars of that magnitude are very faint (the North Star, by contrast, is of second magnitude), so the spacecraft will have its hands full, measuring about 40 million objects.</p>
        <p>Among the stars that the satellite will study are a class called the Cepheids, which are used to  measure the distance of galaxies and other objects that are extremely far away. The telescope should also be able to detect the presence of large planets in orbit around other stars, by accurately measuring a star's wobble, which is caused by the gravitational pull of a planet or other object.</p>
        <p>The satellite, which is expected to be launched in 2004, will use the pressure of solar radiation as a kind of solar sail to help keep the telescope in the proper orientation.</p>
