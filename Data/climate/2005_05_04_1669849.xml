      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial says Pres Bush has good reason to suggest important role for nuclear energy, given sharp rises in fossil fuel prices and mounting evidence that damage from global warming may dwarf any environmental risk from nuclear power; warns Bush will have to address crucial public concerns, such as potential for nuclear weapons proliferation and terrorist attack</p>

        <p>In his sketchy speech on energy policy last week, President Bush placed a high priority on nuclear energy, which he described as ''one of the safest, cleanest sources of power in the world.'' The president had good reason to suggest an important role for this much-feared energy source.</p>
        <p>The price of natural gas, the current fuel of choice for power plants, has risen sharply.

        <p>In his sketchy speech on energy policy last week, President Bush placed a high priority on nuclear energy, which he described as ''one of the safest, cleanest sources of power in the world.'' The president had good reason to suggest an important role for this much-feared energy source.</p>
        <p>The price of natural gas, the current fuel of choice for power plants, has risen sharply. And there is mounting evidence that damage from global warming may dwarf any environmental risk posed by nuclear power. It is therefore critical to keep nuclear power as part of the nation's energy mix. But Mr. Bush will have to address some crucial concerns before the public will follow him down the nuclear path with much enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>For starters, there is the awkward fact that nuclear power plants pose a risk of proliferating the materials and skills to make nuclear weapons. That is not an issue in the United States, which already has a mammoth nuclear arsenal. But if the United States resurrects its stagnant nuclear industry, other nations may also turn to nuclear power, with the risk that rogue nations may someday use the fuel to make bombs. The Bush administration will need to find ways, perhaps through the nuclear nonproliferation review that started yesterday, to ensure that power plants do not become an easy route to nuclear weapons.</p>
        <p>Beyond that, Mr. Bush will need to ensure that the pools holding spent fuel at domestic nuclear plants can be made safe from terrorists. He will have to devise a backup plan for storing nuclear waste, should the proposed burial site at Yucca Mountain prove untenable after legal and regulatory setbacks. He will need to invest in new, potentially safer reactor designs to allay longstanding concerns about accidents.</p>
        <p>Finally, one familiar impediment to nuclear power -- the high capital costs required up front -- could remain troublesome, unless the cost of competing fuels soars higher.</p>
        <p>None of these concerns need rule out this promising source of power. But they will need to be addressed forthrightly.</p>
