        <p>The director of the Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York, John H. Marburger III, has emerged as the leading candidate to be President Bush's science adviser, federal officials said today.</p>
        <p>Dr. Marburger, a physicist, was president of the State University of New York at Stony Brook from 1980 to 1994.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Dr. Marburger said he was a Democrat, but not active in politics. ''If there's any subject that should be bipartisan, it's science,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Many scientists have criticized Mr. Bush, saying that he has been slow to name a science adviser and that he appeared to ignore scientific experts on issues like global warming and a missile defense system.</p>
        <p>Dr. Marburger said he was aware of such criticism. Without confirming that he had been chosen for the job, Dr. Marburger said that he understood that the selection process was ''nearing its end'' and that an announcement was imminent.</p>
        <p>The science adviser normally is director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, and nominees for that position are subject to Senate confirmation.</p>
        <p>One of the first tasks for the new adviser will be to review the nation's energy efficiency. The adviser will also counsel Mr. Bush on stem cell research, the human genome, nuclear weapons, bioterrorism, space, endangered species, the Internet and the training of scientists.</p>
        <p>The science adviser will help Mr. Bush fill about 75 high-level scientific jobs in the federal government.</p>
        <p>Dr. Marburger, 60, is an applied physicist and an expert on lasers. He received a Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1967 and was a physics professor at the University of Southern California in the 1970's.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Dr. Marburger became director of Brookhaven, an immense research laboratory operated under contract with the government.</p>
        <p>Dr. Marburger was chairman of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's fact-finding panel on the Shoreham nuclear power plant in 1983. More recently, he was chairman of a university consortium that ran the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Ill., for the Department of Energy.</p>
