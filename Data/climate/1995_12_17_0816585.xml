        <p>THE grand prescriptions come and go, like education's answer to hemline lengths each fall from Paris.</p>
        <p>Since John Dewey began talking about Progressive Education in the 1920's, concepts on learning have followed, including Life Adjustment Education, the New Math, Whole Language, Mastery Learning, Competency-Based Education, Outcome-Based Education and now Efficacy -- the favorite program of Rudy Crew, the New York City Schools Chancellor, for fostering self-esteem in children and  revitalizing the schools.</p>
        <p>To some critics, there is little in American life as suspect on its face and as fuzzy in its achievements as the assorted cure-alls that crop up with numbing regularity in America's schools. But if the persistence of rosy new prescriptions for saving American education often doesn't say much for the schools, the demand for them doesn't say much for the rest of America either.</p>
        <p>Some educators go so far as to say that anyone who thinks there's a chasm between what's wrong with education and what's wrong with the rest of the nation hasn't really been paying attention.</p>
        <p>"Education like so many other social services and human services is beset by  fads and quick-fix solutions," said Mike Rose, professor of education and communications at the University of California at Los Angeles, who wrote "Possible Lives: The Promise of Public Education" (Houghton-Mifflin, 1995). "But if we blame education, and I think it's O.K. to blame education, we need also to indict the culture at large, which is always looking for quick solutions to complicated issues. It's so damn American."</p>
        <p>Efficacy training, which theorizes that intelligence is learned and is not innate, is an attempt to motivate and instill a sense of esteem in children by setting high goals and providing examples of individual achievement. Developed by the Efficacy Institute of Lexington, Mass., the program is now in use in 400  schools around the country. There have been, however, few long-term evaluations  of its results.</p>
        <p>Many educators, including some who were initially skeptical, say efficacy is  a sensible, mainstream approach to a pervasive problem: children whose life experiences lead them to expect failure rather than success in school. But to some critics of American education and to some skeptical parents, efficacy sounds suspiciously like yet another high-concept, high-cost, Ph.D.-certified example of slapping a fancy term on the obvious or the vague.</p>
        <p>'Waves of Reform'</p>
        <p>"It's the education disease; they're addicted to it," said Charles J. Sykes, whose "Dumbing Down Our Kids" (St. Martin's Press, 1995) makes the argument that feel-good educators have substituted fads for rigor in American schools. Though  unfamiliar with efficacy training, Mr. Sykes said it sounded ominously similar to much that is fashionable in education today.</p>
        <p>"We're always having these waves of reform," he said, "and the one thing they have in common is that there's never any empirical evidence of whether they in fact work. And the worst part is when these things fail, they're repackaged with a different title, presented as innovations and then go on to fail again."</p>
        <p>Even the most enthusiastic supporters of America's schools would be hard pressed to show much in the way of results from many of the more glossy educational innovations, and many of them, like the New Math, which attempted to teach students to think like mathematicians rather than to learn math, or like whole language, in which students learn reading by grasping whole words rather than by sounding them out phonetically, have been subjected to withering rebukes by many parents and educators.</p>
        <p>To Mr. Sykes and other conservative critics, all of the programs are evidence of what he calls "the remarkable persistence of pedagogical quackery," namely, a focus on teaching techniques rather than a genuine transmission of ideas and information.</p>
        <p>But other educators who are less dismissive of the schools make the argument  that there is at least as much quackery and insistence on dubious quick fixes coming from education critics on the right as there is coming from the education establishment.</p>
        <p>David Tyack, a professor of education and history at Stanford University, points to the calls for turning schools over to private businesses or the vogue  for tough-minded dictates in the form of utopian national goals as every bit as  suspect as the hazy educationese. Nothing as yet indicates that private businesses can operate school systems better than school boards, and the lofty edicts of the current goal-setting movement often have little grounding in reality, he said.</p>
        <p>"When people are told that by the year 2000 there will be no adult illiteracy, the U.S. will be first in the world in science and math and there will be no violence in the schools, they simply don't believe it," said Mr. Tyack, co-author with Larry Cuban of "Tinkering Toward Utopia: A Century of Public School Reform" (Harvard University Press, 1995). "It creates an acid rain of cynicism."</p>
        <p>Both he and and Mr. Rose say the real problem with both the school bashers on the right and the educational theoreticians is that they often ignore the reality in the classrooms.</p>
        <p>"I don't think a lot of the people who are so dismissive of education have any appreciation about how hard a lot of teachers are trying to come up with ways to help kids from a wide variety of backgrounds and cultures, kids who speak different languages," said Mr. Rose. "And remember, too, the public is crying out for solutions. Schools are caught between a rock and a hard place. You have on the one hand immense demands to do something immediately and on the  other very real problems where schools are overcrowded, teachers are underpaid,  in some cases schools are falling apart. People want something done tomorrow and that conflicts with a more scientific and thoughtful approach to field testing new proposals."</p>
        <p>Mr. Tyack said the most promising efforts to improve schools are sustained collaborations between schools, teachers and communities over time, like those developed by James Comer, Theodore Sizer or Henry Levin, to name a few educators. The fads of the educators are somewhat less worrisome than calls for, say, business management of the schools, Mr. Tyack said, because in the real world teachers combine traditional teaching with new methods rather that making  radical changes in their own classrooms. In that sense, he said, one virtue of the worst educationese is that even educators refused to take it seriously.</p>
        <p>"There's kind of a policy elite in education that talks like that," Mr. Tyack said, "but my own view is that teachers are pretty allergic to the hype. Policy  talk is a growth industry in the U.S., and not just in education, but I think you have to separate the talk from the practice. They're not the same thing."</p>
