        <p>LEAD: GENERAL Electric scientists have reported evidence for a gradual breakdown in PCB's deposited in Hudson River sediments by spillage from plants manufacturing electrical appliances. The two-stage microbial process, they said, ''will eventually effect total PCB destruction.''</p>
        <p>GENERAL Electric scientists have reported evidence for a gradual breakdown in PCB's deposited in Hudson River sediments by spillage from plants manufacturing electrical appliances. The two-stage microbial process, they said, ''will eventually effect total PCB destruction.''</p>
        <p>PCB's, or polychlorinated biphenyls, were widely used in industry until they were banned in 1976 after an outbreak of what the Japanese called Yusho disease. It was marked by a variety of symptoms, such as skin sores, liver damage and birth defects, and was attributed to contamination of cooking oil with a form of PCB. After animal tests some PCB's were then determined to be cancer-causing.</p>
        <p>Large amounts of PCB's were spilled into the Hudson from General Electric plants at Fort Edwards and Hudson Falls. According to the new General Electric report, as of 1977, there were an estimated 137 metric tons of PCB's on the floor of the river, much of it 6 to 12 inches beneath portions of the river bed where flow in the river was slow. Two-Step Breakdown</p>
        <p>In the journal Science scientists from the General Electric Research and Development Center in Schenectady, N.Y., have now reported that PCB's lying in the Hudson sediment for a decade or more have been partially broken down, initially by organisms that thrive where oxygen is in short supply.</p>
        <p>The polychlorinated molecules (those containing three or more chlorine atoms) that are of primary medical concern are broken down, the researchers said, into those with two or fewer chlorines. The latter can then be digested by oxygen-breathing bacteria.</p>
        <p>The researchers estimated that in the upper Hudson 40 to 70 metric tons of PCB's with multiple chlorines had been broken down to the digestible molecules.</p>
        <p>Dr. Stephen H. Safe, professor of toxicology at Texas A &amp; M University, an authority on PCB contamination who is familiar with the General Electric finding, said in a telephone interview last week that he had ''absolutely no reason to doubt it.'' Skepticism Is Voiced</p>
        <p>But Dr. Edward G. Horn of the New York State Department of Health raised several questions regarding the G.E. estimate on PCB breakdown. In 1977 he took part in a PCB survey of 2,000 samples from the upper Hudson.</p>
        <p>The General Electric scientists, he said in a telephone interview, assumed that the PCB's in their samples were originally dominated by the variety Aroclor 1242, which contains multiple chlorines. He suspects that they may have been of the type designated 1221, in which case they would not have had many chlorines to begin with and no significant breakdown would have occurred.</p>
        <p>He also said that so far laboratory searches for bacteria that are efficient at breaking down multiple-chlorine PCB's have been unsuccessful.</p>
        <p>As evidence of PCB persistence he said the levels of PCB's in striped bass of the lower Hudson, now just under four parts per million, are declining so slowly that at least 33 years will probably elapse before the level drops to the two parts per million considered acceptable by the Federal Food and Drug Administration. Bass in the upper Hudson contain 10 parts per million, he added.</p>
        <p>Dr. Arnold Schecter, professor of preventive medicine at the State University of New York in Binghamton, also cited evidence for stubborn PCB persistence. The State Office Building in that city, contaminated by a PCB spillage in 1981, is still unsafe for occupancy despite efforts at decontamination, he said. Resistance Led to Wide Use</p>
        <p>The General Electric report mentioned Silver Lake in Pittsfield, Mass., which contained an estimated 29 metric tons of PCB's. Out of 80 sediment sections analyzed, only half showed substantial breakdown of the molecules. Dr. Safe of Texas A &amp; M suggested that some special factor, such as the presence of a specific microorganism, seems necessary. Once identified, he noted, it might be used to inoculate areas of severe contamination.</p>
        <p>Like Freon and other fluorocarbons being blamed for depletion of the atmosphere's protective ozone layer, PCB's are synthetic chemicals whose extreme resistance to any form of chemical breakdown made them attractive for a variety of applications.</p>
        <p>They were used in pumps, turbines, hydraulic fluids, adhesives, fire retardants, wax and pesticide extenders, lubricants and carbonless copying paper. Their widest use, however, was in electrical capacitors and transformers.</p>
