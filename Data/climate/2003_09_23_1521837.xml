      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial says Democrats on Senate Environment and Public Works Committee have watched with mounting frustration as Pres Bush has rescinded or weakened one environmental regulation after another without paying political price; says they should use confirmation hearings on his appointment of Michael Leavitt to head Environmental Protection Agency to ask Leavitt how he plans to restore credibility and independence of agency that has been little more than extension of Karl Rove's political operation in White House</p>

        <p>Democrats on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee have little prospect of blocking committee approval of Michael Leavitt, the Utah governor who is President Bush's choice to succeed Christie Whitman as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Yet they owe it to the country and to the environment to use today's confirmation hearings to cross-examine Mr. Leavitt and to ask how he intends to restore the credibility and independence of an agency that for two years has been little more than an extension of Karl Rove's political operation in the White House.</p>
        <p>These senators -- including, prominently, Joseph Lieberman, Hillary Clinton and the independent James Jeffords -- also owe it to themselves. They have watched with mounting frustration as Mr. Bush has rescinded or weakened one environmental regulation after another without paying a political price. These hearings give them a chance to make a coherent case while people are paying attention.</p>

        <p>Democrats on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee have little prospect of blocking committee approval of Michael Leavitt, the Utah governor who is President Bush's choice to succeed Christie Whitman as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Yet they owe it to the country and to the environment to use today's confirmation hearings to cross-examine Mr. Leavitt and to ask how he intends to restore the credibility and independence of an agency that for two years has been little more than an extension of Karl Rove's political operation in the White House.</p>
        <p>These senators -- including, prominently, Joseph Lieberman, Hillary Clinton and the independent James Jeffords -- also owe it to themselves. They have watched with mounting frustration as Mr. Bush has rescinded or weakened one environmental regulation after another without paying a political price. These hearings give them a chance to make a coherent case while people are paying attention.</p>
        <p>On the face of it, Mr. Leavitt's record as governor suggests that he will fit right in with the antiregulatory types who occupy every other important environmental post in the administration. He has won praise for reducing air pollution in the Grand Canyon and for trying to control urban sprawl. But his record for enforcing federal laws like the Clean Water Act has been spotty, and this page has taken him to task for two back-room deals with Gale Norton, the Secretary of the Interior, which could open up millions of acres of potential wilderness in Utah to commercial development.</p>
        <p>The big question, though, is how he intends to resurrect the agency, whose reputation has lately been damaged by its willingness, under pressure, to manipulate science to serve political ends. The most prominent example was some heavy-handed censorship of a chapter on the risks of global warming in what the agency advertised as a comprehensive report on the environment. Several senators have also accused the agency of suppressing evidence that reflect unfavorably on the administration's proposed clean air legislation.</p>
        <p>Here are two questions we would ask Mr. Leavitt: He says he is a great believer in state's rights. What, then, does he make of a terrible proposal awaiting his judgment that would greatly narrow the scope of the Clean Water Act by removing federal protections from millions of acres of wetlands, streams and lakes? Nearly 40 states oppose this proposal. The only people who like it are the home builders and their friends in the White House. Is he prepared in this instance to listen to the states and ignore his masters?</p>
        <p>He also fancies himself a world-class negotiator. If that is so, would he be prepared to broker a deal adding a global warming provision to Mr. Bush's clean air proposal, thus breaking what appears to be an insurmountable legislative impasse?</p>
        <p>Affirmative answers to these two questions do not make him the right man for the job. But they would demonstrate an independent judgment the agency sorely needs.</p>
