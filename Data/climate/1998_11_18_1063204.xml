        <p>Letter from Laurence H Tribe, professor of constitutional law at Harvard University, says Dan Quayle was incorrect in his Nov 16 article in arguing that there is no constitutional basis for Congressional censure of a President</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Dan Quayle is mistaken about the constitutional basis for censure (''Censure Is Not an Option,'' Op-Ed, Nov. 16).

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Dan Quayle is mistaken about the constitutional basis for censure (''Censure Is Not an Option,'' Op-Ed, Nov. 16). Provided that Congress avoids enacting a bill of attainder, its affirmative powers support this compromise. Although Congress must locate textual authority in the Constitution itself whenever it touches life, liberty, property or state prerogatives, it has inherent power to employ mechanisms rationally adapted to its investigative and other missions.</p>
        <p>The occasions on which the House or Senate has censured a Federal official have been justified by the clauses directing each house to ''keep a Journal of its Proceedings'' and providing that ''for any Speech or Debate in either House, [members] shall not be questioned in any other Place.'' The authority of elected representatives to memorialize their ethical judgments is no weaker when they address named officials than when they address global warming.</p>
        <p>Mr. Quayle errs in comparing censure to the independent counsel law, whose constitutional flaw was not, as Justice Antonin Scalia's dissent recognized, the fact that the Framers never mentioned it. The flaw in the act was the fact that it invaded executive responsibility and violated the clause limiting to ''inferior officers'' those whom Congress may empower judges to appoint.</p>
        <p>LAURENCE H. TRIBE  Cambridge, Mass., Nov. 16, 1998</p>
        <p>The writer is a professor of constitutional law at Harvard University.</p>
