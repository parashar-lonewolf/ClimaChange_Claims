        <p>THE control room of the Shoreham nuclear power plant looks as if everybody left in a hurry a long time ago. Papers are strewn about, desks and chairs are askew, and here and there keys are still inserted in switches on dusty panels.</p>
        <p>It has been 14 years since the Long Island Lighting Company signed over the $5.5 billion, 800-megawatt Shoreham plant to the Long Island Power Authority for a ceremonial $1, sealing its fate as the only fully licensed nuclear power reactor never to go into commercial operation.</p>
        <p>Now, with the cost of oil and natural gas used to generate electricity driving utility bills higher and evidence mounting that fossil fuel emissions are linked to global warming, is Shoreham worth a second look?</p>
        <p>The answer is emphatically no, the power authority, the plant's opponents and even some of its supporters said. Even the most determined and well-financed effort to revive Shoreham would face insurmountable difficulties, the authority and others said.</p>
        <p>Bert Cunningham, a LIPA vice president for communications, said the authority had no plans to do anything with the plant other than to let it remain as it is.</p>
        <p>A two-year decommissioning project that the authority completed in October 1994 partly dismantled the interior and removed 560 irradiated fuel assemblies. Other equipment has been auctioned off or left to rust and rot in the plant's darkened interior. The shell of the plant remains standing, Mr. Cunningham said, only because of the cost of knocking it down.</p>
        <p>Even the most ardent Shoreham supporters are not asking for more.</p>
        <p>''It's too far gone,'' said Matthew C. Cordaro, a senior vice president at Lilco during the plant's construction and licensing and now the director of the Center for Management Analysis at the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University. ''You'd have to start from scratch, and nobody is going to make that kind of investment. Right now it is a $5 billion hunk of junk.''</p>
        <p>LIPA customers are paying for the Shoreham plant through electric rates without getting any power from it, Mr. Cordaro said. The authority assumed and refinanced about $4.5 billion in Shoreham debt as part of the takeover.</p>
        <p>Others involved in the 25-year fight to keep the plant from opening said nothing had changed about the impossibility of evacuating the public in the event of a serious accident there.</p>
        <p>''If you had to evacuate, you couldn't,'' said Lee E. Koppelman, the former executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board, who did evacuation planning for Suffolk County. Suffolk's refusal to participate in federal drills for evacuation within 10 miles of the Shoreham plant, the area for which the Nuclear Regulatory Commission required a plan, became a major impediment for Lilco.</p>
        <p>Currently, advocates of increased use of nuclear power include the Bush administration and two emerging boosters -- Christie Whitman, a former Environmental Protection Agency administrator, and Patrick Moore, a founder of Greenpeace. Supporters say nuclear power is a way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and dependence on imported oil and gas.</p>
        <p>But the power industry is showing little interest. Diane Screnci, a spokeswoman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in King of Prussia, Pa., said there were no current proposals for new nuclear plants anywhere in the Northeast. She said the commission had not issued an operating license to a nuclear plant anywhere since 1996, when the 1,121-megawatt Watts Bar generator started up in Tennessee.</p>
        <p>On Long Island, advocates of power generation that does not rely on oil or gas have lined up behind LIPA's plans for wind turbines off the South Shore and want greater investment in solar technology. But they are not clamoring for nuclear power or a Shoreham revival.</p>
        <p>''I don't think offering nuclear power as a solution to global warming is going to go very far on Long Island,'' said Gordian Raacke, the executive director of Renewable Energy Long Island in Bridgehampton. ''Given the history here and the inherent risks of nuclear power, it's a nonstarter. Shoreham is dead and it's not ever coming back to life.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''There are always people who say we never should have shut it down, but I've never heard anyone talk about reviving it.''</p>
        <p>Leading opponents of the plant were not second-guessing themselves.</p>
        <p>''The major problems, including storage of radiological waste, have still not been solved,'' said Nora Bredes, the leader of the Shoreham Opponents Coalition and later a Suffolk County legislator from 1992 to 1998. ''If the federal government would invest in solar energy and renewables the way they do in nuclear power, we would not be in the position we are in now, trying to fight global warming by embracing a technology that still has considerable risks.''</p>
        <p>Irving Like, a lawyer in Babylon and a former LIPA trustee whose opposition to the plant dates to the 1960's, when Lilco first proposed a smaller version in Lloyd Harbor, said that nothing about the unsuitability of the plant site had changed.</p>
        <p>''The reason is just as valid today as when we first opposed the plant: You can't evacuate an island in the event of a serious accident,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Cordaro, the former Lilco vice president, said it was a tragedy that the plant never opened.</p>
        <p>''Our real serious energy problems started with the abandonment of Shoreham,'' he said. ''The main reason behind the plant was to provide an alternative source of energy that didn't depend on expensive foreign oil. If Shoreham were in place today, the fuel surcharges that we are paying LIPA would be a small fraction of what they are now.''</p>
        <p>Huge pieces of equipment remain at Shoreham. A gigantic generator shaft lies on the floor of the turbine building. The equally huge steam turbines, which turned only briefly when Lilco tested the plant at low power in 1985, gather rust.</p>
        <p>Edmund J. Petrocelli, a LIPA project manager, said that even if anyone wanted to buy some of the equipment in the plant, there were practical difficulties.</p>
        <p>''The problem is getting it out of here,'' he said. ''With the amount of labor you'd need, it wouldn't be worth it.''</p>
