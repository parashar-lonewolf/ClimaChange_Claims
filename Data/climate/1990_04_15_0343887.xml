        <p>LEAD: ''This film,'' says Jeff Daniels with as straight and somber a face as the law allows, ''takes a special kind of actor. You have to realize from day one of shooting that the spiders come first. They're picked up first in the morning, they're first in the chair at makeup, they take lunch first. And they've also got the biggest trailer.</p>
        <p>''This film,'' says Jeff Daniels with as straight and somber a face as the law allows, ''takes a special kind of actor. You have to realize from day one of shooting that the spiders come first. They're picked up first in the morning, they're first in the chair at makeup, they take lunch first. And they've also got the biggest trailer.''</p>
        <p>No, not really, but a visitor to the Burbank studio set of ''Arachnophobia'' does hear the assistant director saying intriguing things like, ''As soon as the spiders are set, we roll,'' ''spider redo'' and the repetitive ''Spiders, take 10.''</p>
        <p>''It's really hard on the actors,'' admits the director, Frank Marshall. ''They have to be perfect every time; the spiders, only once. Sometimes we have a spider lotto; everyone puts $5 on the take they think is going to work. Twenty-one takes is the longest we've gone.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Marshall is standing in the hallway of what looks to be a typical suburban house, complete with fireplace, breakfast nook and a television set in the den. But on the wall, near an antique clock, are a handful of rather formidable-looking spiders. When Mr. Marshall calls for action, one of the spider wranglers turns on a hot-air gun attached to a long pole, and the scurrying begins. When the take is finished, the wranglers gently use paint brushes to maneuver their charges into plastic containers suitable for quarts of potato salad. ''We haven't lost any yet,'' Mr. Marshall says with a grin. ''They have a way of turning up.''</p>
        <p>Clearly, filming ''Arachnophobia,'' the working title of a film from Hollywood Pictures, a new division of Disney, in collaboration with Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment, does not present quite the same problems as filming Chekhov. Still, this story of a horde of highly-motivated, murderous spiders that attempt to take over the mythical California town of Canaima is not, in Mr. Marshall's words, ''the spider that ate Cleveland'' but, rather, a suspense thriller on the line of ''The Birds,'' with a healthy dose of humor thrown in. ''People like to be scared but laughing, like a roller coaster,'' says the director. ''No one wants to be terrified.''</p>
        <p>''Arachnophobia'' (it means fear of spiders) is Mr. Marshall's first film as a director, but no one doubts that he is the right man for the job. As producer of some of Mr. Spielberg's biggest hits (often with Kathleen Kennedy, the producer of ''Arachnophobia''), Mr. Marshall oversaw the use of snakes in ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' and ''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'' and rats in ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.'' Could spiders be far behind?</p>
        <p>''As a producer for 20 years, I know how hard directing is, and I didn't want to do anything I'd had no experience with,'' says Mr. Marshall, a relaxed, amiable man with a bemused sense of humor. ''Disney's Jeff Katzenberg sent me the script, and I felt it was something I could do. I didn't want to get into a serious dramatic piece that might stretch me beyond my capabilities.''</p>
        <p>Though everyone knew that ''Arachnophobia'' was going to be about spiders, it took a while to determine exactly which species would be called to stardom. Actually, two different types would be needed, one for the breed called Big Bob (puckishly named by Mr. Marshall for his fellow Amblin director Bob Zemeckis), the party-sized arch-demon spider that invades Canaima from South America; the other, for his smaller but still deadly offspring.</p>
        <p>In charge of the dual search was David Sosalla, the film's visual effects supervisor, whose last film was the more benign ''Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.'' Because Big Bob is a foot across, he would have to be a tarantula, but Mr. Sosalla didn't want to go with the traditional orange-kneed variety, considering it cinematically overexposed (''Tarantula'' et al.). Instead, working with Jules Sylvester of Reptile Rentals, a Los Angeles company specializing in creatures no one else wants to handle, he came up with the especially fierce-looking Amazonian bird-eating tarantula that enjoys shooting fiberglasslike hairs at potential enemies.</p>
        <p>Savage as this fellow was, he was not tough enough to do all of Big Bob's business, and a 15-inch mechanical double was constructed. For one thing, explains Mr. Marshall, ''he has to stalk Jeff Daniels; he has to stay in the right light, and if we waited for him to do that, we'd be here three or four months longer.'' And for another, explains Mr. Sosalla, ''the main character had to become a creature, and no spider out there could give us the vicious, evil close-ups the script called for. The evilest ones, with real ugly looking faces, were too tiny.''</p>
        <p>Picking the smaller, four-inch-wide work-horse spiders that everyone callsJU ''the grunts'' was a tougher task. ''We looked at photographs of hundreds of species, but the majority were quite small,'' Mr. Sosalla says. Finally, four species deemed large enough were selected to compete in what Mr. Marshall calls ''the spider Olympics.''</p>
        <p>''We ran them through 10 tests, a decathlon,'' says Mr. Sosalla, to determine how fast they were, how they fared on different surfaces and how they reacted to heat and cold. The hands-down winner was an Australian species called delena that had been introduced to New Zealand in the 1920's and had been living happily under the bark of trees ever since. After completion of complex paperwork involving both the United States and New Zealand Governments, some 300 delenas, to be continually supplemented by biweekly shipments, were sent off to Hollywood to become stars.</p>
        <p>Though the delenas had unexpected spider benefits, such as the ability to work in groups without resorting to cannibalism, they were, like all spiders, not especially bright. ''You can't train them,'' admits Mr. Sosalla. ''There's no brain in there that remembers anything; it's difficult to get them to do what you want.''</p>
        <p>Undaunted, the ''Arachnophobia'' team came up with several unique control techniques. They discovered, who knows how, that the delena are phobic about Lemon Pledge, which apparently gums up their feet, so spraying lines of it on the set can control their movements. A suspended wire vibrating faster than the eye can see does the same thing. To keep spiders in a relatively contained area, they are put to sleep with carbon dioxide, and tiny monofilament ''leashes'' are attached by wax to their abdomens. And for really complicated shots, minuscule steel plates are glued to the spiders with wax; electromagnets behind a wall then move them to the places where the script calls for them to be.</p>
        <p>Despite all this attention paid to the spiders, both Mr. Daniels, cast as Ross Jennings, a doctor afflicted with arachnophobia, and Harley Kozak, who plays his wife, Mollie, take their status in stride. ''Your basic garden-variety actors, we're all used to sharing the scene with somebody,'' says Ms. Kozak. ''After all, they are the title character; the movie's not called 'Molliephobia.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Daniels, who says he took the role in part because he was curious about the highly successful Amblin Entertainment, says even though his friends think he can hardly wait to get off the picture, he is in fact relishing the experience. ''Would I work with spiders again?'' he asks. ''Make me an offer.''  FILM</p>
