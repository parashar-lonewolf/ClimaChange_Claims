        <p>LEAD: The Senate voted unanimously today to approve ratification of a historic international agreement to limit global use of chemicals that are believed to be destroying the earth's ozone shield. The vote was 83 to 0.  With today's vote, which had been expected, the United States became the first major user and producer of chlorofluorocarbons to approve an international agreement that would first freeze and then roll back their consumption and production.</p>
        <p>The Senate voted unanimously today to approve ratification of a historic international agreement to limit global use of chemicals that are believed to be destroying the earth's ozone shield. The vote was 83 to 0.  With today's vote, which had been expected, the United States became the first major user and producer of chlorofluorocarbons to approve an international agreement that would first freeze and then roll back their consumption and production.</p>
        <p>Chlorofluorocarbons and certain other industrial chemicals are believed to destroy ozone in the upper atmosphere, which protects life on earth from damaging ultraviolet radiation from the sun.</p>
        <p>While praising today's action, environmentalists and some members of Congress said new information about the accelerating decline in atmospheric ozone means even stronger steps must be taken to counter the threat to health and the environment. Agreement in Montreal</p>
        <p>Agreement on the protocol to limit use of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's, and other chemicals was reached in Montreal last September and signed by 31 nations. Until today, only Mexico had ratified the treaty, although many more countries are expected to. The agreement would take effect after it is ratified by at least 11 countries that together account for at least two-thirds of global consumption and production.</p>
        <p>Lee M. Thomas, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the chief United States negotiator for the Montreal protocol, said today: ''This treaty is an unprecedented demonstration of international cooperation and commitment to act responsibly to protect our common environment. The protocol provides the basic framework for ensuring the integrity of the earth's ozone layer. It offers the needed impetus for industry both here and abroad to move forward in their development of environmentally safe alternatives.''</p>
        <p>CFC's are widely used for refrigeration, in foam insulation, as industrial solvents and, outside the United States and several other countries where such use has been banned, as aerosol propellants. These chemicals enter the atmosphere, where they remain for many decades, combining with and destroying ozone molecules.</p>
        <p>Halons, chemicals used in fire extinguishing foam, are also believed to cause ozone depletion and are also covered by the Montreal protocol. Cancer Increase Predicted</p>
        <p>Scientific studies have predicted that as the ozone shield thins and more ultraviolet radiation reaches the earth, there will be a major increase in skin cancers and eye disease among humans and that marine life, crops and forests will suffer.</p>
        <p>Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, had been planning to introduce a resolution to accompany today's ratification vote that would require, he said, that ''we move farther and faster on this.'' His resolution would have enabled the United States to hasten the reduction of CFC use unilaterally, a move opposed by several senators as harmful to trade.</p>
        <p>He did not bring his resolution to the floor today because, he said, ''we did not have enough people lined up.'' But he said he planned to offer his resolution soon because scientific data show increasingly that the loss of ozone ''has the potential of being a global disaster.'' He said that a report due tomorrow from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is expected to show increasing global ozone losses, including losses over the Arctic.</p>
        <p>The protocol calls for the freeze on use of CFC's at 1986 levels to go into effect in 1989. It also calls for their use and production to be cut back by 50 percent by 1999 in a two-step plan.</p>
        <p>David D. Doniger, a lawyer and air pollution expert for the Natural Resources Defense Counsel, a national environmental group, said that CFC's should be phased out completely.</p>
        <p>Rafe Pomerance, a senior associate of the World Resources Institute, a private research and policy group based in Washington, said, ''The Montreal ozone protocol is a critical step in the effort to protect the earth's ozone layer, but not the last.''</p>
        <p>He said that evidence that has accumulated since the protocol was signed last fall, particularly evidence about a drastic loss of ozone over Antarctica, ''demonstrates that ozone depletion is far more rapid and widespread than previously anticipated.''</p>
        <p>But Kevin Fay, executive director of the Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy, an industry organization, said that Senator Chafee's resolution, by proposing possible unilateral action by the United States, would detract from the international effort to control CFC's.</p>
