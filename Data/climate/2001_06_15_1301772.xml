        <p>Most days, Kiffa Alverfors attends college classes, intent on getting a job in media relations. But today she was among thousands who marched through the streets of this city protesting a visit by President Bush.</p>
        <p>Like many others, Ms. Alverfors, 24 -- who carried a handmade poster saying ''Bush: Try Love, Not Greed'' -- had a long list of complaints. ''I am against so many things about him it is hard to explain,'' Ms. Alverfors said. ''The capitalist system is a way of living that I don't agree with.''</p>
        <p>''The system needs rules to control it,'' she said. ''But they are disappearing. Mr. Bush does not think about smaller countries, he only thinks about more income.''</p>
        <p>As President Bush finished what he called candid talks with European Union leaders in an 18th-century country manor nine miles outside this port city, protesters -- sometimes with their faces painted, sometimes pushing baby carriages -- carried banners, and chanted objections to his policies.</p>
        <p>In the crowd was a nine-foot-tall papier-mâché Bush head playing tape recordings of his speeches as well as posters calling him the ''Toxic Texan'' and pictures of him with devil's horns. ''No Star Wars,'' said one banner. ''Jobs Not Bombs'' said another.</p>
        <p>Some marchers looked fierce, waving traditional black-and-red anarchist banners, refusing to talk to reporters and hiding their faces behind dark glasses and masks. And, at one point, a group of protesters clashed with police officers who had sealed a school building to lock in about 400 demonstrators suspected of planning acts of violence. The protesters threw rocks and cobblestones but dispersed when mounted police officers charged. Police officials said eight people were arrested.</p>
        <p>But for the most part, the day's events were peaceful, more akin to a 1960's sit-in than to the violent protests in the city of Seattle during the W.T.O. talks in 1999.</p>
        <p>''I think America and Bush are really going to try to direct the world in their direction and it is not a good one for ordinary people,'' said Gunnel Berge, a 54-year-old drama teacher who marched with two friends.</p>
        <p>''The death penalty is a really uncivilized thing,'' she said. ''Refusing to worry about the environment because he wants to save the American lifestyle -- that's an outrageous thing.''</p>
        <p>Among others, the protesters included environmental, feminist and antiglobalization groups. But the vast majority of marchers were teenagers or college students mixing the urge to protest with the chance to mingle with friends and have a good time on a sunny evening in June.</p>
        <p>At one point, dozens of protesters participated in a mooning -- starting a countdown and then dropping their pants in unison. Three participants, standing side by side, were able to spell out the phrase ''We Hate Bush'' on their backsides.</p>
        <p>The Swedish police had worked for weeks to prepare for violence, including meeting with protesters to listen to their concerns. Protesters had objected to the sight of police officers in full riot uniform, so Swedish authorities reduced the number of such officers along the official route.</p>
        <p>But the police presence in the city was not subtle. Rings of chain-link fences surrounded the conference center for the summit meeting and traffic was blocked from dozens of streets. By afternoon, many merchants near the conference center had boarded up their windows, fearing rock throwers and looting. By late evening, however, no damage had been reported.</p>
        <p>While demonstrators today focused on Mr. Bush, more protests are scheduled for Friday and Saturday after the president goes to Warsaw and Slovenia for the last part of his five-day visit to Europe.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists are especially eager to keep the pressure on the Europeans to sign the Kyoto agreement, which calls for a reduction in greenhouse gases, and which Mr. Bush opposes.</p>
        <p>The president said little during his visit that would suggest he was about to change his mind on any of the issues that occupied the crowds here. But few of the marchers expected to have any impact.</p>
        <p>Anders Westerstraam, 16, said he had come out because ''he just didn't like'' Mr. Bush's policies on abortion, the death penalty and Nafta. But he doubted Mr. Bush would be swayed by the protest. ''I don't think he cares that we are doing this,'' he said. ''But I'm here to show that we don't like these things.''</p>
