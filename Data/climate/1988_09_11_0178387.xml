        <p>LEAD: Air pollution is seriously damaging crop productivity and causing forests to decline in many parts of the United States, according to a report by an authoritative research and policy organization.</p>
        <p>Air pollution is seriously damaging crop productivity and causing forests to decline in many parts of the United States, according to a report by an authoritative research and policy organization.</p>
        <p>The report by the World Resources Institute, released Thursday, is based on new data as well as existing studies. It found that ozone and acidic air pollution were combining with natural stresses such as drought and insects to impose serious damage on the nations forests and farmlands.</p>
        <p>The authors of the report by the institute, which is based in Washington, said that while there had been studies on the role of air pollution in forest and crop damage, this study looked at the problem comprehensively. The situation is more serous than was previously realized, the authors said.</p>
        <p>Damage to crops from air pollution, particularly ozone, is causing losses of up to $5 billion a year in such crops as as soybeans, peanuts, kidney beans, cotton and winter wheat, the report found. Wide Decline in Pine Trees</p>
        <p>While there is no estimate of the dollar losses from tree damage, the report found evidence that pollution was contributing to the wide decline of pine trees in California, of spruce and fir trees along the crest of the Appalachians and perhaps sugar maples in the Northeast. It also found that ozone was probably a major factor in the reduced growth rate of commercial yellow pine trees in the southeast.</p>
        <p>Ozone, created when volatile organic chemicals from automobile exhausts and engines and industrial sources react with sunlight, is a major component of urban smog. It has also been found in high concentrations at rural mountaintops. Acid air pollution is caused largely by sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from coal-burning power plants and other sources. It has been implicated in the destruction of life in bodies of freshwater in the Northeast and Canada.</p>
        <p>Dr. James J. MacKenzie, a co-author of the report, said, ''We are deeply concerned that the forest damage now occurring primarily at high elevations will spread to lower sites and other tree species, just as it has throughout central Europe.''</p>
        <p>At a news conference, Dr. MacKenzie said that the Norway spruce trees at lower elevations were already showing signs of damage.</p>
        <p>Mohamed T. El-Ashry, a co-author of the report, said its findings showed that the Clean Air Act ''has failed to achieve its goals.'' Stricter Controls Sought</p>
        <p>The report said that current trends indicated that the kind of pollution that produces ozone and acidic air pollution was likely to increase in the future unless action was taken to reduce it, including a strengthening of the Clean Air Act.</p>
        <p>The report called for stricter controls on emissions from power plants, factories and motor vehicles. Noting that pollution from these sources was linked to other major environmental problems, including global warming from from the accumulation of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere, the report called for a long-range plan to reduce the common causes of these problems. One of the causes is the nation's heavy reliance on fossil fuel for energy.</p>
        <p>Michael A. Fosberg, a United States Forest Service staff specialist for admospheric sciences, said that he had not seen the institute's report but he aggreed it was ''completely true'' that air pollution combined with natural stresses is harming forests in many parts of the country. He said that it is not possible at this point to determine the extent of the damage.</p>
        <p>Senator George Mitchell, Democrat of Maine, the author of pending legislation to strengthen the Clean Air Act, said the study and other evidence made it clear that it is time to act to strengthen the antipollution law. He expressed optimism that the Clean Air Act would be amended before the current Congress adjourns.</p>
