        <p>LEAD: The leaders of the seven richest Western nations began their 16th annual summit conference in the tropical heat of Houston this afternoon, with an intractable dispute over trade policy threatening to disrupt the unity of the three-day meeting.</p>
        <p>The leaders of the seven richest Western nations began their 16th annual summit conference in the tropical heat of Houston this afternoon, with an intractable dispute over trade policy threatening to disrupt the unity of the three-day meeting.</p>
        <p>At an opening ceremony punctuated by the thunder of howitzers and a brassy chorus of national anthems, President Bush asserted that ''a new world of freedom lays before us'' and urged his summit partners to join him in insuring that it becomes ''a world where peace endures, where commerce has conscience and where all that seems possible is possible.''</p>
        <p>But offstage the United States, supported by Canada, was fighting hard to break down European resistance to Mr. Bush's proposals for the eventual elimination of agricultural subsidies, which he sees as a major threat to free trade.</p>
        <p>The environment also proved a disruptive topic, one on which the United States appeared to be isolated. The Europeans accused the White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu, of blocking any effort for an accord on how to combat global warming. Only a year ago, in Paris, the environment was the dominant topic, but here it has been shoved from center stage. [Page A10.]  On the issue of eliminating farm subsidies, American officials threatened that Washington would walk out of the current round of international trade negotiations, effectively bringing it to an end, unless the Europeans committed themselves here, in specific language in the communique to be issued at the end of the summit meeting, to negotiate in good faith on an agreed timetable.</p>
        <p>According to key negotiators for three countries, the dispute led to the exchange of unusually bitter words between Mr. Bush and Jacques Delors, the president of the European Community, on Sunday night.</p>
        <p>In discussing the elimination of farm subsidies, Mr. Sununu said: ''It is crucial. It is critical. It should and must be done now.''</p>
        <p>Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter said of the European nations: ''They simply have not been engaged in the process. We cannot negotiate with ourselves.'' The subsidies make it difficult for food items produced cheaply in countries like the United States and Australia and in the third world to penetrate major markets.</p>
        <p>'Farmers Would Go Bust'</p>
        <p>Guy Legras, the director-general of agriculture of the European Community, said that Europeans were willing to negotiate, however much the Americans might insist that they were not. But he argued that any elimination of subsidies, however gradual, would create such price fluctuations that ''the farmers would go bust.''</p>
        <p>Bill Brock, a former special trade representative in the Reagan administration who is here in an unofficial capacity, painted the direst picture, predicting that not only the United States but all the world's underdeveloped countries would walk out of the trade negotiations if farm subsidies were not ended ''because they have nothing else to sell but agricultural products.'' The result of such a walkout, he said, would be ''rampant protectionism and economic decline.''</p>
        <p>The negotiations, known as the Uruguay Round, began more than four years ago in Punta del Este, Uruguay, under the auspices of the 105-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The next meeting is scheduled for Geneva on July 23, and the round is due to be completed during the first week in December at talks in Brussels.</p>
        <p>Aid to the Soviet Union appeared to be receding as a potentially disruptive issue at the summit meeting, with Mr. Bush, President Francois Mitterrand of France and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany agreeing in effect to disagree, and each country offering a different kind of aid for its own domestic political reasons without criticizing the other. Mr. Sununu, speaking at a pre-summit briefing earlier today, said the United States continued to oppose huge direct financial aid, like the $15 billion proposed by Mr. Kohl, but would favor sending teams of experts to work on such problems as grain storage, the banking structure, transportation and other items.</p>
        <p>''The approach is one in which we understand that others may have a different sequence of decisions and timing of decisions to be made,'' Mr. Sununu said.</p>
        <p>According to members of the Canadian delegation, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney suggested that the summit nations send a team to the Soviet Union to evaluate the scope of that nation's economic needs. Mr. Bush, whose aides have said he was eager to help President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in ways that would not involve sending direct aid, appears to have taken up the idea with some enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>After a rodeo Sunday night, several meetings between pairs of leaders and other preliminary events, the summit conference began shortly after noon with the opening ceremonies. Mr. Kohl, Mr. Mitterrand and Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti of Italy arrived only this morning, Mr. Kohl and Mr. Andreotti having stayed in Rome for Sunday's World Cup final in which West Germany defeated Argentina by 1 to 0. Mr. Bush, the man of all sports, congratulated Mr. Kohl and informed the somewhat incredulous German that he had played intercollegiate soccer for Yale University in 1945.</p>
        <p>First Meeting for Kaifu</p>
        <p>The late arrivals, along with Mr. Delors, Mr. Mulroney, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan, attending his first such meeting, were greeted by President Bush in the Academic Quadrangle at Rice University. The temperature was near 100 degrees as they stood on a covered platform in front of Lovett Hall, the Romanesque revival administration building designed by Ralph Adams Cram and built in 1912. Air conditioners had been built into the platform's floor to afford a measure of relief.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, in his chattiest form, had a word or two in German for Chancellor Kohl and a phrase or two in French for President Mitterrand as they moved inside, into the building's Founders Room, for their first working session, which lasted about two hours. The leaders sat around a huge oval desk, wearing headphones for simultaneous translations.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Bush outlined the main topics facing the conference, he urged his guests to speak their minds freely and frankly, the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said. Those presentations occupied most of the session, the spokesman said, and ''demonstrated that there are differences, to be sure.''</p>
        <p>Warning From Thatcher</p>
        <p>Mrs. Thatcher was said by British officials to have been particularly pointed in warning against the emergence of three trade blocs - Europe, the Western Hemisphere and the Pacific - which, she warned, would be ''a step backward'' and ''politically stifling.''</p>
        <p>Tonight, all the leaders attended a working dinner at Bayou Bend, once the home of a philanthropist, Ima Hogg, and now a museum of American decorative arts. The food, which included tortilla soup and grilled red snapper with basil lime sauce, was prepared by three of the region's premier chefs: Robert Del Grande of Cafe Annie and Robert McGrath of the Four Seasons Hotel, both in Houston, and Dean Fearing of the Mansion on Turtle Creek, in Dallas.</p>
        <p>A senior member of the Italian delegation said that talk at the dinner, which was dominated by discussion of aid to the Soviet Union, had centered on a new proposal by the United States. Outlined by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, the proposal sought to establish some common ground between the United States on one hand and France and West Germany on the other.</p>
        <p>Negotiators for the seven nations went into session just before midnight to explore the possibilities of a compromise based on the Baker paper.</p>
        <p>The United States had sought all day, in a series of public briefings and background conversations, to keep the pressure on the Europeans on the issue of agricultural subsidies. But by the end of the day, David C. Mulford, Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, said there had been ''no progress in closing the gap.''</p>
        <p>The most intransigent of the Europeans was said to be Mr. Kohl. On a continent with generally inefficient agriculture, the West Germans have the poorest agriculture. Small farms dependent upon subsidies are especially predominant in Bavaria, an area crucial to Mr. Kohl's electoral coalition. He faces elections on Dec. 2, just when the final meetings of the Uruguay round are due to be taking place in Brussels.</p>
        <p>American officials took some pains to indicate that they were ''not naive enough,'' as one put it, to expect a detailed settlement here. But they said they needed a firm agreement on a timetable or Congressional pressure for protectionist legislation would soon resume.</p>
        <p>Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, said that success in the trade talks would provide the world with ''an economic renaissance for the 21st century.'' Failure, she asserted, would mean that ''the world will have a dangerous decline in economic prosperity.''  THE HOUSTON SUMMIT</p>
