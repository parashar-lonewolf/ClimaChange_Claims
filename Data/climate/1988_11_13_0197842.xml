        <p>LEAD: On the day I started reading George Turner's major new novel, DROWNING TOWERS (Arbor House/Morrow, $18.95), the Environmental Protection Agency called for studies of the effects of coastal flooding over the next two decades, just in case the ''greenhouse effect'' elevates global temperatures as predicted and the polar ice caps melt.</p>
        <p>On the day I started reading George Turner's major new novel, DROWNING TOWERS (Arbor House/Morrow, $18.95), the Environmental Protection Agency called for studies of the effects of coastal flooding over the next two decades, just in case the ''greenhouse effect'' elevates global temperatures as predicted and the polar ice caps melt. I hope someone in the agency has the sense to consult Mr. Turner, an Australian writer whose account of a 21st-century Melbourne awash in a rising sea should give nightmares to the least impressionable bureaucrat.</p>
        <p>But ''Drowning Towers'' is more than a cautionary vision of an all too conceivable future; it is also a deftly written story of ordinary and not-so-ordinary human beings coping with the end-of-the-world-as-they-know-it. The central character, Billy Kovacs, is a natural leader who controls one of the towering tenements (70 stories, 70,000 inhabitants) that house the unemployable in a society that can provide jobs for no more than 10 percent of its citizens. The lucky few who earn their bread call themselves the Sweet. The other 90 percent, the Swill, live on the dole and their wits and are the first to suffer as flood waters lap at their lowland towers. Billy uses any means at his disposal to fight for his neighbors and his family (which includes his ex-Sweet mistress and her ungrateful children), while a semisecret underground sows the seeds of a different, more rational society.</p>
        <p>Mr. Turner juggles multiple viewpoints and cinematically abrupt scene changes with reassuring aplomb. His stylistic control is all the more impressive since his writing is informed by an indignation worthy of a latter-day Jeremiah. By refusing to provide hissable villains, he forces us to contemplate our own culpability for the deteriorating environment. The weak and the venal who maneuver for larger slices of a diminishing pie earn cold pity from Mr. Turner, since they cannot recognize their own self-destructive behavior.  *</p>
        <p>THE GATE TO WOMEN'S COUNTRY by Sheri S. Tepper (Foundation/Doubleday, $17.95) is a feminist fable set somewhere in the Pacific Northwest 300 years after a nuclear holocaust. Men and women now live in separate but adjacent communities. Although the men are organized into military garrisons, the women appear to have the upper hand in government, deciding matters of trade and law and, most important, reproduction. Physical contact between the sexes is limited to semiannual ''carnivals''; male children are given to the garrisons at age 5; when boys are 15, they must choose to remain as warriors or return to ''women's country'' to live out their lives as eunuchlike ''servitors.'' Not surprisingly, few desert their garrison.</p>
        <p>While most postnuclear novels borrow details of social structure from medieval Europe, Ms. Tepper draws her inspiration from the classical world; the performance of a play depicting the Trojan War from a woman's perspective has achieved the status of holy writ. There is no mistaking the author's antimale bias; female characters tend to be warm-hearted and competent, their male counterparts devious and dumb. The story, which concerns rebellion kindled by sexual restlessness, sputters but never quite catches fire - for a good reason. The elaborate society that the author takes such pains to describe is based on a big lie; the story she tells is part of the deception. Some will find this narrative strategy as distasteful as the secret it conceals. But Ms. Tepper is not afraid to ask hard questions, beginning with this: If biology is destiny, how can society hope to control its self-destructive tendencies without controlling biology as well? According to the book jacket, Ms. Tepper was executive director of Rocky Mountain Planned Parenthood for 24 years.  *</p>
        <p>Terry Bisson's FIRE ON THE MOUNTAIN (Arbor House/Morrow, $16.95) is an entertaining exercise in alternate history. Its premise is that the face of America would be very different today if John Brown's raid on the Federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry in 1859 had been a success. Suppose Brown and his followers had gone on to conduct a brilliant guerrilla campaign that shattered the confidence of the Southern states and emboldened the enemies of slavery all over the world? The result might have been the establishment of Nova Africa, a thriving nation that seems to encompass most of the Old South. Twelve-year-old Harriet Odinga, whose great-great-grandfather ran away from slavery to join Brown, lives in Nova Africa. She and her mother are taking a nostalgic trip along the border between Nova Africa and the U.S.S.A. (the United Socialist States of America). The year is 1959. The account of their trip is intercut with long excerpts from the papers of Harriet's eminent ancestor and of his mentor, an abolitionist doctor from Philadelphia who witnessed many of the crucial events of what came to be known as the Independence War.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bisson's 1959 is a pleasant place to visit. Blacks are strong, self-confident, in control of their own country; a benign socialism is the dominant political and economic system not only in North America but elsewhere; Africa is the most civilized continent; technology has advanced rapidly without causing widespread pollution; there is no hint of war between nations. Yet, as much as I enjoyed Mr. Bisson's playful speculations, I came away wondering what, if anything, he was trying to say about human nature by suggesting that we would all be living in utopia but for one small setback in the War Between Good and Evil nearly 130 years ago.  *</p>
        <p>Anthropologists and archeologists have long brooded over the mystery of classic Mayan culture: having created a high civilization in the jungles of Central America, the people apparently abandoned their beautiful cities and temples and reverted to a simpler life in the surrounding countryside. DESERTED CITIES OF THE HEART by Lewis Shiner (Foundation/Doubleday, $17.95) offers a solution to this mystery.</p>
        <p>The key figure is a burned-out rock guitarist named Eddie whose wanderings take him into the Mexican jungle, where he meets a band of Lacondon Indians who claim descent from the classic Maya. He dares to eat a hallucinogenic mushroom that induces time-obliterating visions; under the influence, he learns about the internal conflicts that destroyed the civilization of the city-builders. He also learns that their descendants are doing what they can to bring about the predicted end of our own civilization, not for any malign reason but simply to insure that the next ''cycle of time'' gets off to a proper start. Mr. Shiner knows better than to ask the reader to swallow this tall tale on its own. Slyly, he embeds Eddie's revelations in a fast-moving adventure story about modern-day Mexico, replete with desperate rebels, hard-eyed defenders of the status quo, brutal North American ''advisers,'' an ambitious journalist, a beautiful woman with a mission and a good man who is looking for something to believe in.</p>
        <p>Despite some imaginative rearranging of recent history, Mr. Shiner's Mexico has the gritty feel of reality. His intimate portrait of the Lacondon Indians is based on a first-hand account published a few years go by Victor Perera and Robert D. Bruce, one of the books he acknowledges as sources in an exemplary author's note.</p>
