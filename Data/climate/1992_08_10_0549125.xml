        <p>An Indonesian mining company has begun marketing coal from a huge deposit in Borneo that has 80 percent less sulfur than the cleanest American coal, allowing it to be blended with dirtier coal and burned without smokestake equipment used to control acid rain.</p>
        <p>When burned, the Borneo coal produces less carbon dioxide than most coals. Carbon dioxide is a gas that scientists believe contributes to the "greenhouse effect," which could alter the earth's climate. If using the new coal eliminated the need for "scrubbers" that clean coal smoke, even less carbon dioxide would be created because the chemical process of removing sulfur from coal smoke also releases carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>Experts are puzzled by the coal deposit in the Indonesian portion of the island of Borneo, which they say is the cleanest ever analyzed.</p>
        <p>"It is pretty amazing coal," said Hugh W. Smith, the director of fuels at the Tampa Electric Company in Florida, which burned tens of thousands of tons of it as a test this year. "It has some very different characteristics from a lot of the coals we've looked at," he said.</p>
        <p>R. Peter Calvert, the executive in charge of fuel planning at another utility, the New England Electric System, based in Westborough, Mass., said, "It's weird."</p>
        <p>Another expert, A. Denny Ellerman, executive director of the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said such low-sulfur coal was "very desirable for all sorts of blending purposes."</p>
        <p>The coal is so clean, Mr. Ellerman said, that it is "like solid natural gas from a sulfur dioxide standpoint." Natural gas is almost free of sulfur, and utilities are turning to that fuel, in some cases, to replace high-sulfur coal.</p>
        <p>The Indonesian mining company, P. T. Adaro, has been digging out the clean coal for about a year at a mine in South Kalimantan, in the Indonesian part of Borneo near the town of Tanjung.</p>
        <p>The area gets about eight feet of rain each year, and may have been even wetter over the tens of millions of years it took to form the coal. The rain may have played a role in the deposit's exceptional purity.</p>
        <p>P. T. Adaro is now producing only about two million tons a year, but output is scheduled to rise to eight million in coming years, and eventually reach about 20 million. The company is marketing the fuel as "enviro-coal."</p>
        <p>The fuel has less energy per pound than many other coals because it has a relatively high proportion of hydrogen to carbon. That limits the Borneo coal's usefulness in some settings because many boilers are often designed to handle coal of only a certain energy content per pound. But the relatively low proportion of carbon in the coal means it gives off slightly less carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>Sulfur output of coal is customarily measured in the amount released per million British thermal units of energy, a quantity of heat that is sufficient to make about 100 kilowatt-hours of electricity, or about five days' worth for a typical American suburban house. The Borneo coal gives off about a tenth of a pound of sulfur dioxide per million B.T.U.'s, compared with three or four pounds from a high-sulfur American coal.</p>
        <p>The deposit, which is near the coast and can be shipped easily by water, has another advantage: it lies under only 10 to 40 feet of dirt and rock, sort of like finding a species of lobster without a shell. The coal is found in seams of 90 to 220 feet thick; seams in the United States are typically 3 to 10 feet.</p>
        <p>Frederick Murrell, the American representative of P. T. Adaro in Bradenton, Fla., said that the company now recovered about two tons of coal for each ton of rock it moved. In this country, ratios of 15 tons of rock to 1 ton of coal are not unusual.</p>
        <p>A key question is whether more such clean coal is waiting to be found. P. T. Adaro has thus far identified about two billion tons of the coal. The United States produces about a billion tons a year, of which 900 million tons are used domestically and about 100 million tons are exported.</p>
        <p>A bigger factor, however, is whether such deposits exist outside Borneo.</p>
        <p>"The mind is repelled by the notion that there is only one deposit of coal of this quality in the world," said Russell Seitz, an energy expert at the Olin Center for Strategic Studies at Harvard University. "A cardinal rule of geology is that nothing happens only once."</p>
        <p>Dr. Seitz said that because coal was so abundant in this country, prospectors have largely stopped looking for it, and thus may have overlooked significant deposits of ultra-clean coal. "Everyone has coal coming out of their ears," he said, "but it's rotten, lousy coal." Question of Price</p>
        <p>Dr. Ellerman and others noted, however, that the price premium that utilities would be willing to pay for the clean coal would depend on the cost of alternative ways of removing sulfur dioxide from coal smoke. The cost of compliance with the Clean Air Act is estimated by experts at about $300 a ton of sulfur removed.</p>
        <p>The value of the clean coal to utilities is also limited by the way the Clean Air Act is written. Most utilities are not required to reduce sulfur dioxide to the lowest feasible level, but only to a level below a legislative ceiling, which can be accomplished with domestic fuels.</p>
        <p>Carbon dioxide emissions are not regulated under American law, although some European countries have proposed taxing them. Dr. Seitz said that replacing high-sulfur coal and a scrubber with coal like the Borneo deposit and no scrubber would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 15 percent.</p>
        <p>Coal experts say that the Borneo mine, while modest in size, could supply power stations in this country that are struggling to meet clean air rules, and could also threaten some American exports of coal. The Indonesian coal can fill a niche, said Rafael A. Villagran, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers. "We're going to find stiff competition getting coal into the Pacific rim," he said.</p>
