        <p>LEAD: As he campaigns across the country, Senator Bob Dole maintains that ''the Federal budget deficit is the single greatest threat to a prosperous and dynamic America.''</p>
        <p>As he campaigns across the country, Senator Bob Dole maintains that ''the Federal budget deficit is the single greatest threat to a prosperous and dynamic America.''</p>
        <p>Vice President Bush, in his stump speeches, asserts that ''we must reduce the barriers to economic growth, and that includes the Federal budget deficit.''</p>
        <p>The other candidates for the Republican Presidential nomination, who are running behind Mr. Bush and Mr. Dole in the national public opinion polls, make similar points. In their views on budget policy, the Republican candidates differ mainly in the rigidity with which they oppose any tax increase.</p>
        <p>But, like most of those seeking the Democratic nomination, the Republicans shy away from specific proposals that could be counted on to lower the deficit, which is now running at about $150 billion a year. All of them say they would reduce spending by the Federal Government, but most have also endorsed expensive new programs, although not to the extent the Democrats have.</p>
        <p>None has endorsed higher taxes. Three - Mr. Bush, Pete du Pont and Representative Jack F. Kemp - pledge that they will allow no new taxes whatsoever.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, for example, says, ''I am not going to raise taxes, period.'' Mr. Kemp and Mr. du Pont are just as adamant about tax increases, but they place somewhat less importance than the other Republicans on the deficit problem. Deficit Seen as a 'Symptom'</p>
        <p>Mr. Kemp, who is from upstate New York, maintains that the deficit is a ''symptom'' and that the country can ''grow its way out of the deficit'' with a stable dollar, lower interest rates and low taxes. Mr. du Pont, a former Governor of Delaware, takes a similar stance.</p>
        <p>Senator Dole, a Kansan, opposes raising income tax rates but leaves the door open to other taxes, including one on imported oil. He also suggests he would close unspecified tax ''loopholes.'' Former Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. would consider new taxes only after all possible ways to cut spending had been exhausted. Pat Robertson, the former television evangelist, says he would consider raising excise taxes on alcohol and cigarettes but no other taxes.</p>
        <p>In fact, all the Republican candidates except Mr. Dole propose tax cuts of one form or another or new income tax deductions, credits or exemptions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush and Mr. Kemp would lower to 15 percent the maximum tax rate on capital gains, which will be 28 percent in most cases next year and 33 percent in some. Capital gains taxes are paid on the profits from the sale of stock and other property. A reduction in the tax rate, these candidates say, would stimulate investment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush also favors tax-free savings accounts for money that parents set aside for their children's college education, and in the past he has advocated increased tax breaks for oil and gas producers. Mr. Kemp would cancel an increase in Social Security taxes scheduled for 1989.</p>
        <p>Mr. du Pont would allow tax credits for retirement accounts at a cost to the Government, he estimates, of $20 billion a year. Mr. Haig would allow new tax incentives for business investments in plants and machinery. Mr. Robertson supports a wide range of new tax breaks for individuals and businesses, including an increase in the exemption taxpayers are allowed for each dependent. No Specifics on Spending Cuts</p>
        <p>Without exception, the Republican candidates talk about the need for fiscal responsibility. But they caution against steep cuts in the military budget, and none have specified the domestic programs they would reduce to bring down Government spending. Most of them imply or say outright that they would find places to reduce waste in the Government budget without indicating the targets.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dole talks about making ''tough choices'' and offering ''bitter medicine'' to reduce Government spending, and, as Republican leader in the Senate, he has strongly supported many budget-cutting measures. He says all programs including Social Security would be targets of potential cuts except those that benefit only poor people, but he has not named particular budget items he would reduce or eliminate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kemp suggests in his stump speeches that spending for military and domestic programs other than Social Security should limited to no more than the amount needed to take account of inflation. However, he speaks often of increases in military spending and of the need to maintain adequate support programs for the poor.</p>
        <p>Mr. du Pont says he would close some military bases, without saying which bases, and would gradually abolish farm subsidies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Haig generally supports a 2 percent to 3 percent cut in all areas of the budget, including the military and programs for the poor, and he would institute an immediate freeze on new appropriations for two calendar quarters. But he says the Government should be careful to see that no single part of the budget is cut too much. Line-Item Vetoes Favored</p>
        <p>All the Republican candidates would give Presidents the authority to veto particular items in appropriations bills rather than accepting or vetoing the legislation as a whole. All but Mr. Kemp and Mr. Haig also support a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced Federal budget by a specified time. Mr. Kemp and Mr. Haig say such an amendment would overly restrict the flexibility a President must have to run the Government.</p>
        <p>Most of the Republicans have pet proposals that would require additonal Government spending.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush would restore cuts made by the Reagan Administration in college student loans and vocational education and would expand the Head Start program for preschool children. He also favors Government subsidies to promote making ethanol from grain as a substitute for gasoline and promises to spend more enforcing narcotics laws.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dole favors national fellowships to train outstanding teachers, more money for prenatal care and programs to reduce illiteracy and the school dropout rate. He promises to ''make sure that every student who wants to go to college can'' and to ''make sure that the elderly are not financially devastated by the cost of long-term illness.''</p>
        <p>Mr. du Pont wants mandatory drug testing for high school students, an expensive proposition, and a program he says would cost $7 billion in the first year to provide jobs for people on welfare.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kemp would accelerate research on a multibillion-dollar, space-based missile defense system so that it could be deployed even sooner than the President has suggested.</p>
        <p>Mr. Haig advocates new appropriations for AIDS research and control of acid rain.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robertson does not press for new spending programs, but the tax breaks he suggests would cost the Government many billions of dollars a year in lost revenue.</p>
