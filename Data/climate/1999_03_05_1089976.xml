        <p>Nearly $1 billion in emergency aid to storm-stricken Central Americans ran afoul of partisan budget politics in the House and Senate today, dooming any chance that President Clinton could deliver the relief package when he visits the region next week.</p>
        <p>Republicans in both houses were willing to approve the aid, but only on conditions the President would find unacceptable -- cutting an equal amount from programs like food stamps and welfare assistance. The House Republicans disregarded pleas from their new Speaker that they go along with Mr. Clinton's plans without causing problems.</p>
        <p>''It seems that the Republican majority is looking more to play politics with some of the issues than in providing the very needed aid,'' said the White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, who denounced the proposed cuts.</p>
        <p>The Senate Appropriations Committee unanimously approved $1.9 billion in new spending, which included $956 million to help countries like Honduras and Nicaragua rebuild after they were devastated by storms last fall. It also contained $100 million in aid to Jordan and $285 million in assistance for American farmers and ranchers hurt by the economic turmoil in Asia.</p>
        <p>Senator Ted Stevens, an Alaska Republican who heads the Appropriations Committee, said the offsetting cuts came from programs that received extra money last fall, which would not all be spent this year. But he acknowledged that the cuts were politically sensitive and might not survive a White House veto or negotiations with the House.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stevens and the Republican leadership are under strong pressure from fiscal conservatives to stay under the self-imposed spending caps, and not skirt the restrictions by giving the spending emergency status as Congress often does in providing aid for natural disasters.</p>
        <p>In another jab at the Administration, the committee approved by voice vote an amendment from Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas, that would bar the Federal Government from recouping any settlement proceeds the states have negotiated with the tobacco industry.</p>
        <p>The White House's five-year budget projections assume that the Federal Government would receive $18.9 billion from the tobacco settlements.  Despite today's vote, the committee was sharply divided, foreshadowing a fierce floor battle.</p>
        <p>Across the Capitol, a meeting of the House Appropriations Committee was canceled today after Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, also under pressure from budget hawks as well as top lieutenants like Tom DeLay and Dick Armey, both of Texas, ordered the panel to find offsetting cuts in its budget to pay for the Central American aid.</p>
        <p>Mr. DeLay and Mr. Armey, taken aback by the Senate seizing the traditional House role of demanding fiscal responsibility, also expressed anger that the Government was willing to send millions to storm victims in Latin American and the Caribbean, but shortchange American farmers.</p>
        <p>The House action dealt a setback to Mr. Hastert, who expected to benefit along with Mr. Clinton from quick action on the emergency foreign assistance. Mr. Hastert had not originally sought offsetting cuts for that aid, although lawmakers had done so for the assistance to Jordan.</p>
        <p>''The simple fact is, a lot of our members want to be fiscally responsible,'' said John P. Feehery, Mr. Hastert's spokesman.</p>
        <p>The about-face illustrates the problems Republicans face as they run into self-imposed budget restraints despite large projected surpluses. It also shows the challenges Mr. Hastert confronts in dealing with a six-vote House majority and rumblings that Mr. DeLay, the minority whip, is calling the shots.</p>
        <p>Democrats seized on the Republicans' decisions to portray a Republican Party insensitive to the needs of the poor in this country and abroad.</p>
        <p>''I find it puzzling that the offsets suggested by some of our Republican colleagues would cut food stamps and welfare assistance for the needy in this country to pay for assistance for the needy in Honduras,'' said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader.</p>
        <p>But all of the committee Democrats voted for the bill, accepting Mr. Stevens' explanation, as did Tom Harkin of Iowa, or vowing to fight the cuts on the Senate floor or in House-Senate conference committee, as did Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota.</p>
        <p>The proposed cuts from the current budget include $262 million in food stamps, and $70 million in climate change and international environmental programs. The bill also included $80 million to provide new detention centers for Central American immigrants fleeing their storm-ravaged countries. To pay for most of this, the committee cut $65 million from border enforcement naturalization programs.</p>
        <p>To win Democratic support, Mr. Stevens added $130 million in agricultural aid to the original bill, and created a new program for the steel industry that would guarantee up to $1 billion in emergency loans.</p>
        <p>Correction:  March 9, 1999, Tuesday  An article on Friday about House and Senate bills for emergency aid to Central American storm victims misstated the title of Representative Tom DeLay, Republican of Texas.  He is the majority whip, not the minority whip.</p>
