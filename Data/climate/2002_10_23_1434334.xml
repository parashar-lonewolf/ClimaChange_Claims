        <p>Protesters in Iraq Seek Missing Prisoners  President Saddam Hussein's decision on Sunday to open the gates of his prisons and let tens of thousands of political prisoners and common criminals go free prompted small but remarkable protests by some who lost relatives into the hands of the state security police years ago. The protests are the most visible sign of a new and potentially seismic trend: a willingness among ordinary people to speak up.</p>
