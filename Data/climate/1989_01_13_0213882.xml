        <p>LEAD: President-elect Bush's choice for Secretary of Energy is being asked to lead one of the most complex and expensive environmental and rebuilding programs in history with only a fraction of the financial resources experts have said are needed to complete the work.</p>
        <p>President-elect Bush's choice for Secretary of Energy is being asked to lead one of the most complex and expensive environmental and rebuilding programs in history with only a fraction of the financial resources experts have said are needed to complete the work.</p>
        <p>In naming James D. Watkins, a 61-year-old retired admiral, Mr. Bush has chosen the first career military officer to run the nation's vast and crippled nuclear weapons industry since Lieut. Gen. Leslie R. Groves, head of the secret Manhattan Project to build the first atomic bomb in World War II.</p>
        <p>Admiral Watkins, a former Chief of Naval Operations and member of Admiral Hyman G. Rickover's program to design, build and operate nuclear-powered ships, was schooled in nuclear technology and nuclear engineering. If confirmed by the Senate, he would have the most extensive technical training of any Secretary in the Energy Department's 11-year history.</p>
        <p>''Admiral Watkins is uniquely suited to carry out these important tasks,'' Mr. Bush said today at a news conference. But it may be the admiral's skill as a leader and an advocate that will prove most valuable to Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>In October 1987, Admiral Watkins assumed command of President Reagan's Commission on AIDS, a panel deeply divided, overwhelmed by public criticism and close to collapse. Eight months later, under his guidance, the 13-member commission delivered to Mr. Reagan a widely applauded 279-page report that was critical of the Administration's handling of the AIDS epidemic and urged several new programs to eradicate the disease.</p>
        <p>Admiral Watkins must now duplicate the feat on a much larger scale. The vast agency, with a budget this fiscal year of $13.9 billion, is charged with developing new energy sources, insuring the supply of conventional energy sources and promoting the use of alternative energy technologies. Emphasis on Nuclear Power</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said today that his nomination of Mr. Watkins signaled a new emphasis within the Department of Energy to develop and promote greater use of nuclear power plants to supply civilian energy needs. But oil and gas industry executives worried about the admiral's professed lack of expertise in fossil fuels. Mr. Bush said today that he suggested that the admiral name an oil and gas industry expert as Deputy Secretary.</p>
        <p>Yet it is in the $8.1 billion-a-year program to develop and build nuclear weapons that Admiral Watkins will find the toughest problems, according to Congressional leaders, critics and top officials of the Energy Department.</p>
        <p>Two of the most important weapons plants in the 12-state industry, the Savannah River plant in South Carolina and the Rocky Flats plant in Colorado, are partly shut down to repair equipment and retrain personnel. Production of tritium, a radioactive gas used in warheads, and plutonium, an explosive metal, has been halted for months. It is not known when either plant can be reopened. But the Pentagon is pressing the department to reopen the South Carolina plant before repairs are completed to avoid what a tritium shortage.</p>
        <p>Critics of the department, including the Natural Resources Defense Council, said today that they feared that because of his military background the admiral would be sympathetic to Pentagon experts and produce nuclear materials with equipment that has not been proved safe to operate.</p>
        <p>Admiral Watkins denied that today, saying production would not resume ''at the expense of safety.''</p>
        <p>The morale of the department's weapons builders has plummeted as a series of nuclear accidents, sloppy procedures, haphazard waste disposal and other safety lapses have been made public. As a result of the turmoil, the department has had difficulty hiring qualified experts to manage repair and cleanup programs estimated to take at least a century and cost $100 billion to $200 billion.</p>
        <p>A report issued by the White House today said that the department would need to spend $4 billion to $5 billion a year extra until 2010, or a total of $81 billion, to clean up and modernize nuclear weapons plants. The department will spend $1.75 billion this year on environmental cleanups and modernization. Just $159 million of that will be spent on actually digging up and disposing of contaminated soil or reducing pollution in underground drinking water supplies.</p>
        <p>President Reagan's budget for the fiscal year 1990 calls for increasing the environmental and modernization program to $1.99 billion. But to gain the increase, funds are being taken from other cleanup programs, including cutting a third of the $22 million for cleaning up old Atomic Energy Commission research and development sites around the country, and slashing to $96 million a program to clean up piles of radioactive uranium mill spoils scattered across the West. That program will cost $111 million this fiscal year.  The admiral must deal with a fierce battle inside the department for control of the weapons program between managers who run the weapons sites and engineers seeking to improve safely at the sites.</p>
        <p>Admiral Watkins said today: ''I have confidence that after I've had a chance to get my feet on the ground in the position of Secretary of Energy, I can help find that desired and balanced formula wherein safety is never subverted, the environment is adequately protected, and national security and other energy objectives are achieved in harmony with each other.''</p>
        <p>He will be limited in his choices by the deficit. Congressional leaders said today that he will probably need to reformulate Mr. Reagan's 1990 budget request to direct funds from less urgent programs, particularly a high-technology plutonium processing plant proposed for a weapons complex in Idaho, to clean up what is regarded as the gravest environmental contamination ever produced by a Government agency.</p>
        <p>''Does Watkins have the fiscal tools to solve the problem that's been dropped in his lap?'' asked Representative Les AuCoin, an Oregon Democrat who is a member of the House Appropriations Committee. ''The answer is absolutely not.''</p>
        <p>''The key question,'' he added, ''is can this rather remarkable man turn into the strong inside advocate who can introduce a dose of reality that will transform the bean counting in the budget into the real dollars that will truly finance solutions?'' Mother Ran for Senate</p>
        <p>James David Watkins was born on March 7, 1927, in Alhambra, Calif. His mother, Louise, ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate in 1938.</p>
        <p>He graduated from the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis in 1949 and nine years later earned a masters degree in mechanical engineering from the United States Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif.</p>
        <p>In the 1950's, he came to the attention of Admiral Rickover, head of the program to develop small, powerful reactors to propel submarines and ships. He went on to join the Navy's nuclear propulsion program.</p>
        <p>His first assignment was at the Atomic Energy Commission's Oak Ridge School of Reactor Technology in Tennessee to study nuclear engineering. In 1960, he was assigned to the Naval Nuclear Power Training Unit in West Milton, N.Y. He later served as executive officer aboard the Snook, a nuclear-powered submarine.</p>
        <p>In 1962, he joined Admiral Rickover's staff in Washington as an administrative assistant and served there for two years until in 1964 he took command of the Snook. In 1967, he took command of the Long Beach, the first nuclear-powered cruiser.</p>
