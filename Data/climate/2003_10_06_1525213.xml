      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial says Democrats are acting in unison to block nomination of Michael Leavitt as new head of Environmental Protection Agency and should display equal resolve in carving out parts of energy bill they think useful and killing the rest</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>So the Democrats can act in unison, after all. Last week, Democrats on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, plus the independent James Jeffords, boycotted a meeting at which Republicans had hoped to endorse the nomination of Michael Leavitt as the new boss of the Environmental Protection Agency. The boycott was denounced as partisan pique and a personal insult to Mr. Leavitt, the Utah governor. We prefer to see it as a disciplined, albeit rare, Democratic effort to register dismay with President Bush's environmental policies. Nor will this be the only protest. Should the panel, as expected, eventually approve Mr. Leavitt, the Democrats will block the nomination on the Senate floor until the administration provides honest answers about its policies on clean air and water.</p>
        <p>Our admiration for this display of cohesion is tempered, however, by the Democrats' failure to display equal resolve on a matter of greater consequence: the energy bill now taking shape in private negotiations among Republican leaders. This is not a bill equal to the problems it claims to address. It would have no impact on global warming and only marginal impact on the country's long-term dependence on foreign oil, even in the unhappy event that Congress approved Mr. Bush's plan to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</p>

        <p>So the Democrats can act in unison, after all. Last week, Democrats on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, plus the independent James Jeffords, boycotted a meeting at which Republicans had hoped to endorse the nomination of Michael Leavitt as the new boss of the Environmental Protection Agency. The boycott was denounced as partisan pique and a personal insult to Mr. Leavitt, the Utah governor.

Should the panel, as expected, eventually approve Mr. Leavitt, the Democrats will block the nomination on the Senate floor until the administration provides honest answers about its policies on clean air and water.</p>
        <p>Our admiration for this display of cohesion is tempered, however, by the Democrats' failure to display equal resolve on a matter of greater consequence: the energy bill now taking shape in private negotiations among Republican leaders. This is not a bill equal to the problems it claims to address. It would have no impact on global warming and only marginal impact on the country's long-term dependence on foreign oil, even in the unhappy event that Congress approved Mr. Bush's plan to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</p>
        <p>But the bill's generous subsidies would make many individual members of Congress and their corporate contributors happy, and even with the Senate in recess, the distribution of pork continues apace. Just last week, for example, newspapers in Minnesota reported that Senator Norm Coleman, a Republican, had arranged for the bill to include up to $800 million in federal loan guarantees for a new power plant in a depressed area of his state. This, in turn, seems to have persuaded him to rethink his campaign pledge to oppose Arctic drilling.</p>
        <p>The Democrats are not immune to such blandishments. What keeps farm state liberals like Tom Daschle of South Dakota tethered to a bill they generally dislike is a provision greatly increasing the use of corn-based ethanol as a gasoline additive. This would be a boon to corn farmers and politicians who need their votes, though by itself it would have a trivial impact on the country's energy problems.</p>
        <p>To these Democrats, we make the same suggestion we have given to senators eager to fix the nation's electric power grid without signing on to the rest of the energy bill: carve out the parts they think useful and vote on them separately. If Mr. Daschle feels so strongly about the ethanol provision, he should try to break it loose from the larger bill and see whether it flies on its own. Having done that, he and his like-minded colleagues could follow their best instincts and kill the rest of this dreary bill.</p>
