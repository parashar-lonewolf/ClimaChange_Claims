        <p>Peruse the old-time photos of Adirondack sporting life and inevitably you come across this classic shot: the grizzled guide, his smooth-faced tweedy young client, and on the grass between them enough gaping speckled trout to keep a sushi chef busy for a month.</p>
        <p>Alas, those days of simply unbelievable angling are gone. But the six million acres of New York's Adirondack Park still boast some of the best trout waters east of Montana. And unlike flyfishing's holy shrine rivers in the Catskills, where fishermen are often shoulder to shoulder, the Adirondacks offer miles of stream where you are not likely to see another human being for days.</p>
        <p>By tradition flyfishing for trout is a snooty sport, and with good reason. The equipment tends to be expensive; the best split cane rods can cost over $1,000. The technique is exacting and is based on a body of knowledge as recondite as the rites of Freemasonry. And wading the big, rugged streams can be arduous and perilous. For all that, the rewards are sometimes sublime, and not measured in pounds or inches only. I think of the September day when the air was filled with cedar waxwings swooping for midges and one of the crested, jewel-like birds perched on my rod tip, I suppose believing me to be a tree. Or the day when I followed a great blue heron around the bends of a Saratoga County brook, watching him stalk fry in the shallows.</p>
        <p>The Adirondacks are rugged and dramatic, but what distinguishes them from other ranges of the east - the Greens of Vermont, the Whites of New Hampshire - is their waters, the hundreds of lakes and ponds and miles of river that the others simply do not have. Winslow Homer distilled this essence in watercolors like ''Mike Pond,'' where a bright blue and yellow sunfish hangs lucently against the mysterious dark of the forest.</p>
        <p>Spring arrives late in the Adirondacks. The trout season opens statewide on April 1, but conditions in the North Country do not really prime up until sometime in May. Until then, the fish remain sluggish in water under 50 degrees and do not feed much, while the rivers rise and grow silty with runoff.</p>
        <p>Mayflies, stoneflies, and caddis flies form most of a trout's diet. When the larvae or nymphs of these insects swim to the surface of a stream and emerge as winged adults they are said to hatch. Some varieties of mayfly tend to do this en masse, so that when a hatch is in progress the air over stream will be filled with millions of winged adults looking to mate, while below the trout go mad trying to slurp them off the surface when they briefly pause to dry their wings. This feeding frenzy is called a rise - both singular and collective - and to be in the midst of such a spectacle is one of flyfishing's glories.</p>
        <p>About the most dependable mayfly hatch is that of the Hendrickson, or Ephemerella subvaria, which occurs for a week or more late in May and is punctual, at 3 o'clock each afternoon. One of the best places to find this hatch is the Adirondacks' premier stream, the West Branch of the Ausable River.</p>
        <p>The Ausable River flows north out of the high peaks, runs just outside the town of Lake Placid and wends 45 miles to Lake Champlain. The 2.2-mile stretch through Wilmington Notch, right under the Whiteface Mountain chairlift, is designated special trophy water, which means that live bait may not be used. Route 86 parallels it and there is public access at many points. Here, the stream plunges down a series of waterfalls into black pools between boulder-strewn runs that are known as pocket water. The first time I fished it, I was so awestruck by what surrounded me that I let go after a cast and watched my costly split bamboo rod sail out of my hand and begin to sink into an apparently bottomless pool.</p>
        <p>Luckily, I was using a floating flyline. I was standing on a boulder about the size of a tract house and I clambered down in a panic as the line itself started to disappear, foot by foot, dragged under by the rod. Only six inches of line remained above water when I snatched it up. Since then, I have reminded myself that the West Branch is not a good place to lose my head. This is big, dangerous water, especially for someone wearing 25 pounds of rubber waders and a tackle vest. But there is a 15-inch trout behind every rock.</p>
        <p>The East Branch of the Ausable is even more accessible, paralleled by Route 9N between the hamlets of Keene and Upper Jay. It is not nearly so rugged as the West Branch, nor stocked so heavily, and it has sometimes been overlooked and underfished.</p>
        <p>The Saranac is another river with two branches. The South Branch, running from Union Falls downstream for five miles to the village of Clayburg, is a favorite stretch for members of Trout Unlimited, a national anglers association. Town roads follow it in a general way, but actually getting on the water requires tramping through some brush. The North Branch of the Saranac in the stretch above Alder Brook is ''relatively unfished,'' according to one Adirondack guide, Don Jones. Route 3 runs along it. Here again bushwhacking may be necessary.</p>
        <p>The Bouquet River from Elizabethtown to New Russia along old Route 9 is shallow, gravelly and canopied with vegetation. It is considered an ''early'' stream because the water warms quickly and after June the trout hole up in deeper pools. But it is easy to wade and classified as ''wild and scenic'' by the state.</p>
        <p>The Adirondack angler is likely to encounter three distinct species of trout in any of these rivers. Foremost is the speckled trout, sometimes called brookie or squaretail, Salvelinus fontinalis. The brookie is the only one of the three actually native to these waters and strictly speaking is not a true trout at all but rather a subspecies of Arctic char. These beautiful fish, metallic green with bright blue and red spots, survive in a wild state, reproducing naturally, mainly in small feeder creeks where they rarely grow larger than 14 inches.</p>
        <p>Outnumbering them in the big rivers are brown trout, Salmo trutta.</p>
        <p>Imported from Scotland and Germany in the 1800's, the brown trout has been so successful in America that it has all but eradicated the brookie in bigger streams unless brookies are stocked. A hardier fish, the brown can stand warmer water and more pollutants. It is also considered much ''smarter'' than the native fish, which strikes recklessly at just about anything. ''Some days they'll be biting on old doorknobs,'' a state fisheries biologist, Larry Strait, remarked.</p>
        <p>The third fish is the rainbow trout, Salmo gairdneri, which was originally limited to the Sierra Nevada. This is the most acrobatic fighting trout, known for dancing on its tail when hooked. It likes real rough water with a lot of oxygen, but tends not to reproduce very well unless it can run down into a big lake.</p>
        <p>The State of New York stocks all three fish where the conditions best suit them. It also stocks a brook-lake trout hybrid called a splake. Except for the rainbows, there is plenty of natural reproduction and it does not take much experience to learn the difference between a stocked fish and a wild one that has survived a year or more in the stream. The hatchery fish are fed a product called -yes, it's true - trout chow. Their meat tends to be mushy. The meat of a wild trout is firm and flaky. The meat of a wild brookie is the best of all: firm, flaky and clearly pink in color.</p>
        <p>For the intrepid adventurer who does not mind hiking or paddling a way, there are three rivers in the central Adirondacks that get little angling. The first is the Hudson, still a wilderness stream 30 miles or so from its source, but picking up speed. Fish the stretch between the mouths of two tributaries, the Cedar and the Boreas. It holds very large wild browns. To get there, walk north on the Delaware &amp; Hudson Railroad tracks from the spot where 13th Lake Road meets Route 28 at the hamlet of North River.</p>
        <p>A prime stretch of the Boreas can be reached by walking up the same tracks, starting 10 miles farther north. The North Woods Club Road, a public road off Route 28N above Minerva, ends at the railroad tracks. Hop onto the tracks, which follow the river north for 10 wild miles. This is big pocket water, with a cobble bottom and large boulders that make for hard wading. Stonefly nymphs are the best bet here in June and July.</p>
        <p>The Cedar River Road from the Village of Indian Lake follows the Boreas for 12 miles until it ends at an old logging impoundment called the Cedar Flow. Upstream of the flow is wild pocket water that one guide termed ''just paradise.'' This stretch must be reached by canoe up the flow, or by hiking five miles on the Northville-Lake Placid Trail from the Cedar River Road.</p>
        <p>For those who don't mind driving a couple of hours more there are three additional first-class trout rivers that flow north into the St. Lawrence watershed. The state has purchased public fishing rights to the Salmon River in the stretch above Malone, easily reached on Route 11. The Chateaugay is an unusual stream, part of which runs through steep-walled chasms. It has a bottom of chunky standstone and produces heavy hatches of caddis flies. It is also crossed by Route 11. The North Branch of the Greater Chazy in northern Clinton County is touted by guides and state fishery people alike. The hitch is that these streams are well-known to the flyfishers of Montreal, an hour and a half away.</p>
        <p>Those who might wonder why this vast, gorgeous wonderland is so sparsely populated need only consider the black fly. There are four species of this pest that bedevil humans in the Adirondacks and they are all nasty. Unlike the fastidious mosquito, with its syringe-like proboscis, the black fly chews a ragged hole in the skin to gorge. Unlike the mosquito, it adores daylight, the sunnier the better. Black flies invariably attack in swarms as the larvae emerge from the same cold mountain streams where the trout dwell. Moreover, the black fly season is virtually identical to the prime of trout season: May and June. Step out of your car unprepared and within minutes your face can look like a cranberry muffin.</p>
        <p>Luckily there are repellents. Most commercial preparations that contain the chemical known as DEET (N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) keep them at bay, but entomolygists at the New York State Black Fly Research Station in Cambridge, N.Y., swear by a product called Avon Skin-So-Soft. Why the stuff works they do not seem to know, but they say the flies cannot stand it. A hat with jungle netting all around is a good adjunct, and most tackle shops in the Adirondacks stock them.</p>
        <p>Finally there is acid rain. Most of the impact to date has been in the western Adirondacks, in higher-altitude lakes and ponds, where snow and ice melt in the spring and shock the habitat with a big dose all at once. The streams I have recommended are still hospitable to trout. But there is every indication that acid rain is going to get worse.  PLANNING A FLYFISHING EXPEDITION  Getting to the Rivers</p>
        <p>Interstate 87 is the chief route into the Adirondack Park from New York City. Pick up Route 28 off Exit 26 at Pottersville to reach the Hudson, Boreas and Cedar Rivers area. Route 73 at Exit 30 will take you to the Bouquet, Saranac and Ausable Rivers region, and also to the village of Lake Placid, the park's commercial hub. The Chazy, Salmon and Chateaugay Rivers can be approached by several highways off Exit 37 at Plattsburgh. Licenses The state trout season begins April 1 and closes Sept. 30, though parts of some rivers, like the Hudson and Ausable, are open for trout all year. The license fee is $9.50 for residents, $20.50 for out-of-staters. Three- and seven-day licenses are also available at reduced rates. Fishing licenses are sold at all town halls and at many tackle shops.  Guide Services</p>
        <p>McDonnell's Adirondack Challenges, Post Office Box 855, Saranac Lake, N.Y. 12983; phone 518-891-1176. Brian McDonnell offers packaged excursions or design-your-own trips into the back country.</p>
        <p>Jones Outfitters, 37 Main Street, Lake Placid, N.Y. 12946; 518-523-3468. It offers licensed guiding and flyfishing school on weekends in conjunction with the Orvis Company, a rod-maker.</p>
        <p>Francis Betters, Adirondack Sporting Goods, Route 86, Wilmington, N.Y. 12997; 518-946-2605. Mr. Betters originated the designs of many trout flies that are now American benchmarks.  Equipment</p>
        <p>Flyfishing tackle is not generally available for rental, so you will need your own, but it is not necessary to go the $1,000 route. A perfectly serviceable outfit for the novice can be bought for under $100. Full chest-height waders are necessary until at least early July when it becomes possible to wade in old sneakers. A large excellent map of the North Country has been printed by the Adirondack Park Agency and is sold at state information centers along I-87.  Accommodations</p>
        <p>For information on hotels and inns, write the Lake Placid Chamber of Commerce, Main Street, Lake Placid, N.Y. 12946. Or call 518-523-2445. The Wilmington Notch state campground lies within earshot of the West Branch of the Ausable off Route 86. The Buck Pond state campground at Onchiota is hard by the North Branch of the Saranac. Lake Harris state campground outside Newcomb makes a good headquarters for the Hudson-Boreas-Cedar Rivers area. - J. H. K.</p>
