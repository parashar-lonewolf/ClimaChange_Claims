        <p>Major automakers have agreed to cut the emissions of greenhouse gases by the end of the decade, Canada's minister of natural resources said Wednesday.</p>
        <p>While offering little detail, the minister, John Efford, told Canada's House of Commons that a deal had been reached. News of the agreement was first reported by The Globe and Mail of Toronto.</p>
        <p>''I'm pleased to announce today,'' Mr. Efford said, ''that we have indeed reached a voluntary agreement with the Canadian auto sector to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.''</p>
        <p>The successful negotiations in Canada are a distinct contrast to the situation in the United States, where California's attempts to legislate emissions have run into strenuous legal challenges from automakers.</p>
        <p>''Just getting the industry to the table is a huge accomplishment,'' said John Bennett, a senior policy adviser for the Sierra Club of Canada, which has been pushing for improved automobile efficiency as a crucial element of the country's commitments under the Kyoto protocol on climate change.</p>
        <p>''Nobody else has been able to do that in North America,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In Washington, Dan Becker, the director of the Sierra Club's Global Warming Program, said that the cost of producing separate models for Canada combined with the industry's continental integration could mean that the agreement would help bring more efficient vehicles to the United States as well.</p>
        <p>''The Canadian government has managed to bludgeon the auto industry into submission,'' Mr. Becker said.</p>
        <p>Mark Nantais, the president of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers' Association, which represents the Ford Motor Company of Canada, General Motors of Canada and DaimlerChrysler Canada, said the pact emerged from ''very intense'' negotiations since early February. But Mr. Nantais said his group would not comment until a formal announcement is made in the next week to 10 days.</p>
        <p>Adrian Coleman, the director of technical affairs for the Association of International Automotive Manufacturers of Canada, which includes most of the major Asian and European makers, confirmed that his membership was part of the agreement but also declined to comment.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Becker and Bob Mills, who holds the position of environment critic in the opposition Conservative Party, said they had both been informally told that the automakers agreed to cut their vehicles' greenhouse gas emissions by a total of 5.3 million to 5.4 million metric tons by 2010.</p>
        <p>Mr. Becker said that would require an industrywide fuel efficiency improvement of about 25 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mills expressed some skepticism about putting such a change in place in less than five years.</p>
        <p>''The technology is there but the timeline is very short,'' Mr. Mills said.</p>
        <p>Thomas C. Austin, an automotive engineer at Sierra Research, an environmental consulting company in Sacramento that provides services to auto companies, said the target was difficult to assess without details.</p>
        <p>However, he added, Canadians' preference for smaller cars -- DaimlerChrysler's introduction of the Smart microcar has been very successful -- will ease the industry's job somewhat.</p>
        <p>''Based on the Canadian model mix, most manufacturers have a head start,'' Mr. Austin said.</p>
        <p>Exactly what will happen if the car companies do not meet their commitment is not clear. Mr. Mills and Mr. Becker said Canada's environment minister, Stephane Dion, was trying to amend the country's Environmental Protection Act so that it would cover greenhouse gases as well as traditional toxic pollutants.</p>
        <p>That would give the government the ability to act through regulations if the automakers did not meet the terms of the agreement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dion's office did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
