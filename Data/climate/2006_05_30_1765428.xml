        <p>Letter from Prof Robert J Brecha says America has lost 10 years in which to address climate change while pundits and politicians tried to persuade nation against action; says effort required now will be significantly greater, with reduced chances of achieving goal of avoiding serious damage (May 24 Gregg Easterbrook Op-Ed article)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Although it is true that the scientific consensus for anthropogenic climate change has continued to strengthen, the results of numerous studies published in the past year are not qualitatively different from the conclusions published in the 1995 second assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.</p>
        <p>We have, however, lost a decade of crucial time in which we could have started to address the problem of global warming; instead, politicians and pundits like Gregg Easterbrook worked hard to convince us that we should not act. The counter to this argument slips into his article when he admits that ''all air pollution problems of the past have cost significantly less to fix than critics projected.''</p>

The counter to this argument slips into his article when he admits that ''all air pollution problems of the past have cost significantly less to fix than critics projected.''</p>
        <p>In the face of legitimate scientific uncertainty concerning a problem with major potential consequences, instead of taking the prudent and morally responsible course of early mitigation, we were led down the comfortable path of waiting and watching.</p>
        <p>Now the efforts required will be significantly greater, with reduced chances of achieving the goal of avoiding serious damage to humanity and the ecosystem.</p>
