        <p>At a time when American politics sometimes seems polarized to the point of paralysis, two men who could end up running against each other for governor of New York found common cause this week on an issue of importance to all Americans: clean air.</p>
        <p>At a joint news conference in Albany, Gov. George E. Pataki and Attorney General Eliot Spitzer announced two agreements that will greatly reduce pollution from six upstate coal-fired power plants. Emissions of nitrogen oxide, the main precursor of urban smog, will drop by 18,000 tons -- the equivalent of removing 2.5 million cars from New York's roads. Emissions of sulfur dioxide, which causes the acid rain that has been so harmful to the Adirondacks and other northeastern forests, will decrease by more than 123,000 tons a year -- the equivalent of mothballing every diesel truck and bus operating in the United States.</p>

        <p>At a time when American politics sometimes seems polarized to the point of paralysis, two men who could end up running against each other for governor of New York found common cause this week on an issue of importance to all Americans: clean air.</p>
        <p>At a joint news conference in Albany, Gov. George E. Pataki and Attorney General Eliot Spitzer announced two agreements that will greatly reduce pollution from six upstate coal-fired power plants. Emissions of nitrogen oxide, the main precursor of urban smog, will drop by 18,000 tons -- the equivalent of removing 2.5 million cars from New York's roads. Emissions of sulfur dioxide, which causes the acid rain that has been so harmful to the Adirondacks and other northeastern forests, will decrease by more than 123,000 tons a year -- the equivalent of mothballing every diesel truck and bus operating in the United States.</p>
        <p>These were, in short, filthy plants, accounting for more than one-fifth of the state's nitrogen oxide emissions and fully half of its sulfur dioxide emissions, and any living creature downwind of these plants should be glad that their owners have agreed to clean them up. The two biggest are the Huntley and Dunkirk plants in western New York, currently owned by NRG Energy. The other four are in the Finger Lakes and Southern Tier regions and are now owned by AES.. The companies will install new pollution control equipment, switch to cleaner-burning coal and shut down several antiquated boilers.</p>
        <p>Apart from helping New Yorkers breathe more easily, the agreements provide further evidence of the usefulness of the federal Clean Air Act, and in particular one crucial provision that the Bush administration has been trying to get rid of since it came into office. The provision, known as New Source Review, requires older power plants to install state-of-the-art pollution controls when they undertake major modifications. Working with the state's Department of Environmental Conservation, Mr. Spitzer's investigators found that the six upstate plants had undergone such modifications without installing the legally mandated controls.</p>
        <p>This week's settlements build on a campaign that Mr. Spitzer began in 1999 to bring the New Source Review provision to bear on power companies east of the Mississippi that had been making major upgrades and portraying them as routine maintenance in order to dodge the Clean Air Act. Pollution floating from these plants into New York on the prevailing winds has made it almost impossible for the state to meet federal clean air standards.</p>
        <p>The attorney general and the federal Environmental Protection Agency have sued more than 50 plants altogether. Responding to industry complaints, the Bush administration moved in late 2003 to weaken New Source review beyond recognition. The matter is now in court, where Mr. Spitzer and others are fighting to preserve the law.</p>
        <p>The settlements bring credit not only to Mr. Spitzer but to Mr. Pataki, has built a strong record on environmental matters and has not been afraid to drop the regulatory hammer on industry, much to the annoyance of his friends in the White House. Indeed, should they end up as opponents, clean air is one issue on which Mr. Pataki and Mr. Spitzer will have a hard time upstaging one another.</p>
