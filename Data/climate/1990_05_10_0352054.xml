        <p>LEAD: The General Assembly today narrowly approved a bill that would require a 14-day ''cooling off'' period between the initiation of most gun transactions and the final delivery of the weapon.</p>
        <p>The General Assembly today narrowly approved a bill that would require a 14-day ''cooling off'' period between the initiation of most gun transactions and the final delivery of the weapon.</p>
        <p>The measure extends the current state law, which requires a waiting period for only handgun sales, to include all firearms, including shotguns and rifles. If signed by Gov. William A. O'Neill, who has expressed no opposition, it would make Connecticut the second state after California to extend the waiting periods to cover all firearms, according to Handgun Control Inc., a Washington lobby group that tracks state gun laws.</p>
        <p>In most of the 12 states that have waiting-period laws, the statutes apply only to handguns, and the waiting periods are typically two to seven days, the handgun group said. Other states, including New Jersey and New York, restrict purchases by requiring each buyer to get a permit before the sale can be completed.</p>
        <p>But as the Assembly worked feverishly toward its legally mandated midnight adjournment, a companion gun bill restricting assault-rifle sales died even though portions of it had been approved by both chambers. That measure would have brought the sale of military-style semiautomatic rifles under the same law that governs handgun sales, thus requiring assault-rifle owners to carry gun permits.</p>
        <p>'Just Wasn't Enough Time'</p>
        <p>The bill died after it was amended in the Senate too close to the adjournment deadline for the House to take action. Some legislators had seen the bill in part as a slap against the O'Neill administration for its investment of pension funds earlier this year in Colt's Manufacturing, a Hartford-based company identified specifically in the bill as an assault-gun maker.</p>
        <p>''There just wasn't enough time to save it,'' said Representative Robert Godfrey, Democrat of Danbury and a sponsor of the bill.</p>
        <p>The Assembly also approved several bills with potential long-range effects, including one that would require the state to reduce energy consumption in public buildings by 30 percent in the next 10 years, and reduce fossil fuel use as a way to fight global warming.</p>
        <p>Another bill approved in the closing hours would gradually eliminate a home-release program for state prison inmates over the next three years, and require all prisoners to serve at least half of their sentences.</p>
        <p>To Examine Spending Practices</p>
        <p>The Assembly also moved toward approval of a package of laws intended to improve the way Connecticut writes its annual budget and deals with budget deficits.</p>
        <p>The state has faced large shortfalls in revenue for the last two fiscal years, including a $243 million gap in the $6.8 billion budget for the year ending on June 30, and the budget proposals were formulated in response to the ad-hoc method in which the deficits were resolved. One of the proposals, for example, would create a ''program auditing'' unit within state government that would have the power to examine spending practices at various state agencies to assess their efficiency.</p>
        <p>Officials at the unit would be able, for instance, to assess how well or poorly the state spends money on job training, computer hardware or any other general area. Another proposal would require a spending plan beyond the current fiscal year to be formulated with each annual budget, as a way of holding down spending growth.</p>
        <p>Spending-Cut Bill</p>
        <p>A third bill would require the Governor to take some action - left entirely to his or her discretion - to cut spending during the fiscal year if tax revenues drop suddenly or are lower then projected for two consecutive months.</p>
        <p>The proposals were all forced on the Assembly by various groups of legislators who held out for some kind of a spending overhaul. One group of Democrats in the House, for instance, insisted on presentation of the program-auditing bill and the mid-year spending-cut bill before they would agree to support the overall budget.</p>
        <p>In the Senate, Democrats threatened to hold up legislation favored by house leaders unless the long-term planning bill went forward.</p>
