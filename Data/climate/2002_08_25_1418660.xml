        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You report that President Bush wants to ease laws on logging (front page, Aug. 22). This must be viewed in the context of other environmental actions he has taken during his presidency.</p>
        <p>Since taking office, he has proposed reversing a prohibition on road-building in 58 million acres of national forest, revoked a provision requiring mining companies to clean mine-related pollution and revised regulations so that industrial waste may be dumped in streams.</p>

        <p>You report that President Bush wants to ease laws on logging (front page, Aug. 22). This must be viewed in the context of other environmental actions he has taken during his presidency.</p>
        <p>Since taking office, he has proposed reversing a prohibition on road-building in 58 million acres of national forest, revoked a provision requiring mining companies to clean mine-related pollution and revised regulations so that industrial waste may be dumped in streams.</p>
        <p>This latest plan is but another example of Mr. Bush's putting the short-term interests of big industry above the preservation of our natural heritage.</p>
        <p>If President Bush is truly committed to preventing further fires, he should address the global warming that is causing the severe drought conditions that predispose to fire.</p>
