        <p>Pointing to high fuel costs and dependence on foreign oil, Gov. Rod R.

        <p>Pointing to high fuel costs and dependence on foreign oil, Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich wants his state to overhaul its energy sources with a strategy that experts said would be among the nation's most ambitious, including replacing half its current supply of gasoline from imported oil with that made from homegrown products in little more than a decade.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, Mr. Blagojevich, a Democrat seeking a second term in November, will announce a five-part, $1.2 billion plan, elements of which would require the legislature's support, aides said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blagojevich's aides said he would call for financial incentives to build up to 20 ethanol plants, five biodiesel plants and four facilities that would create ethanol from wastes like corn husks and wood pulp in Illinois, where five ethanol production plants operate now and where three more are under construction.</p>
        <p>He will seek additional incentives to increase the number of service stations selling biofuels, with the goal that all of Illinois' 5,000 or so service stations would offer E-85 (which is 85 percent ethanol) by 2017, compared with just 130 that offer it today. And, his aides said, Mr. Blagojevich will press to build a pipeline in the state that will move carbon dioxide, created by coal gasification plants in Illinois, to the oilfields in the southeastern section of the state, where it can be used to extract more oil and gas.</p>
        <p>Environmental advocates said Mr. Blagojevich's proposal reached beyond similar efforts that have been proposed elsewhere. Jim Marston of Environmental Defense described it as ambitious and cautioned that others beyond the governor's office, including automobile makers, service station owners and venture capitalists, would have to cooperate with such a plan for it to become reality.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Marston said he viewed Mr. Blagojevich's sweeping proposal as a positive step. ''The states are jumping in to fill a void created by Washington,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But in Illinois, a spokesman for Mr. Blagojevich's Republican opponent in November, Judy Baar Topinka, questioned both the governor's record on renewable energy funds and the timing of his announcement. Last week, Ms. Topinka released her own energy plan, which called on Illinois to ''become the national leader on renewable fuels,'' said John McGovern, the spokesman.</p>
