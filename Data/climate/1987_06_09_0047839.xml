        <p>LEAD: The Supreme Court today upheld, 6 to 3, a Social Security regulation that has been used to deny hundreds of thousands of disability claims in recent years, particularly those of older workers whose conditions prevent them from doing physical labor.</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court today upheld, 6 to 3, a Social Security regulation that has been used to deny hundreds of thousands of disability claims in recent years, particularly those of older workers whose conditions prevent them from doing physical labor.</p>
        <p>But the majority of the Court interpreted the regulation so narrowly, while criticizing the Government for using it improperly against qualified applicants, that the ruling was only a partial defeat for disability claimants.</p>
        <p>The regulation denies disability benefits to people who suffer only ''slight abnormalities,'' rather than medically severe impairments, without consideration of what kinds of jobs their age, work experience or education would qualify them for. Older people whose impairments prevented them from continuing in their jobs contended that it was too late to learn another line of work.</p>
        <p>New York and several other large cities and 29 states, including New York and New Jersey, had challenged the regulation as illegal and said it added to their public assistance burdens. The decision means that lower Federal courts may not bar the use of the regulation altogether, as many courts, including those in New York and New Jersey, have done. They may, however, block the Government from using it to deny benefits to qualified applicants. Impact Difficult to Gauge</p>
        <p>The impact is difficult to gauge, because it depends in part on how broadly the decision is interpreted by the Government and lower courts deciding complex suits involving hundreds of thousands of disability claimants around the nation.</p>
        <p>Under the 1978 ''severity regulation'' that the Court upheld today, if medical evidence indicates that the person's disability is not so severe as to disqualify the claimant for most jobs, the application can be denied summarily without consideration of the claimant's age, work experience or education.</p>
        <p>The Court's decision seemed to turn in part on the fact that the Social Security Administration had softened the impact of the regulation in 1985, after losing many lawsuits.</p>
        <p>Social Security ruled then that claims for disability benefits should be summarily denied on medical grounds only ''when the medical evidence establishes only a slight abnormality or combination of slight abnormalities which would have no more than a minimal effect on an individual's ability to work,'' regardless of age, education or work experience. One Step in the Process</p>
        <p>Nancy Morawetz, a lawyer with the Legal Aid Society of New York who represents a class of people who have challenged the rule, said today: ''I'm not disappointed. It is a mixed result. I think it's not surprising that the Court upheld the regulation on its face, and it is a real victory that the Court said the regulation has to be applied very narrowly.''</p>
        <p>The case involved one step in the complex five-step process by which the Government handles more than two million claims for disability benefits a year under the Social Security Act.</p>
        <p>The law provides disability benefits for former workers and indigent people who are so seriously impaired, mentally or physically, that they are unable to work at their former jobs or, considering their age, education and work experience, at any other job because of physical or mental impairment.jority opinion held that the language and history of the Social Security Act, including amendments in 1984 that were designed mainly to help large numbers of disability claimants whose benefits had been terminated, supported this streamlined procedure.</p>
        <p>''If the impairments are not severe enough to limit significantly the claimant's ability to perform most jobs, by definition the impairment does not prevent the claimant from engaging in any substantial gainful activity,'' he said. Increasing Efficiency</p>
        <p>He added that ''the severity regulation increases the efficiency and reliability of the evaluation process by identifying at an early stage those claimants whose medical impairments are so slight that its is unlikely they would be found to be disabled even if their age, education and experience were taken into account.''</p>
        <p>Justice Powell neither disputed nor adopted arguments by five other Justices and the plaintiffs that the regulations had been misapplied, saying the only issue in the case was whether its language conflicted with the Social Security Act.</p>
        <p>The immediate loser in the case, Bowen v. Yuckert, No. 85-1409, was Janet Yuckert, a former travel agent and real estate broker who sought disability benefits in 1980, saying she could not work because of flat feet, an ear dysfunction, dizzy spells, headaches and an inability to focus her eyes.</p>
        <p>The Federal appeals court had reversed rulings by lower courts and the Goverment denying her disability claims without considering her age, education or experience, on the ground that her medical impairment was not ''severe.'' Justice Powell, overturning that decision, sent the case back to the appeals court to consider whether evidence on her medical condition justified the conclusion that her impairment was not severe.</p>
        <p>But two members of the majority, Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and John Paul Stevens, said in a concurring opinion that criticism by lower courts of the regulation's use and statistical evidence showing a dramatic increase in the number of benefit denials after the regulation was adopted suggested that the regulation ''has been applied systematically in a manner inconsistent with the statute.''</p>
        <p>Because the three dissenters, Justices Harry A. Blackmun, William J. Brennan Jr. and Thurgood Marshall, said the regulation was invalid, it is clear that they would go at least as far in narrowing it as Justices O'Connor and Stevens. Together they constitute a majority of the Court, so lower courts will apparently be guided by the concurrence in determining what the law now is.</p>
        <p>Justice Blackmun's dissent argued that the regulation ''directly contradicts the statutory language requiring that a claimant's age, education and work experience be considered in a case where the claimant cannot perform his past work.''</p>
        <p>Justice Blackmun said that ''perhaps the most disturbing'' aspect of the severity regulation was ''the disproportionate impact that its application has had on claimants in the older age categories.''</p>
        <p>''A relatively young, well educated and experienced individual who can no longer perform his past work due to a medical impairment may be able to transfer his skills to another job,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Other opinions today included the following:  Central Intelligence Agency And Homosexuals</p>
        <p>It agreed to hear an appeal by the Government in a case in which the Central Intelligence Agency's late Director, William Casey, suspended and then dismissed a technician who had been rated an excellent worker after the man had told the agency in 1982 that he was a homosexual.</p>
        <p>The Government, appealing a Federal appeal's court decision that had allowed the man to pursue a narrow aspect of his claim that his discharge violated his constitutional rights, argued that ''the Director has unreviewable authority to discharge an officer or employee of the C.I.A.''</p>
        <p>The plaintiff was identified in court papers only as John Doe, to avoid disclosing the identity of a former C.I.A. employee. He was hired in 1973 as a clerk-typist and promoted to a covert position as an electronics technician. He said his homosexuality did not embarrass him and was known to his family and friends and did not subject him to blackmail or any other security threat. The agency nonetheless dismissed him, saying his homosexuality posed a security threat. The case is Webster v. Doe, No. 86-1294.  Acid Rain Case Is Refused</p>
        <p>Turning aside an appeal by the New York State, New Jersey, Connecticut and five other Northeastern states, the Canadian province of Ontario and environmental groups, the Court refused to cOnsider the legality of the Reagan Administration's refusal to order reductions in air pollution emissions that cause acid rain.</p>
        <p>The Court's action in New York v. Thomas, No. 86-1373, and Queen of Ontario v. Thomas, No. 86-1374, let stand a Federal appeals court ruling upholding the Environmental Protection Agency's refusal to take such regulatory action.</p>
