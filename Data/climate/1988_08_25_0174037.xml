        <p>LEAD: Republicans are arguing these days that Gov.</p>
        <p>Republicans are arguing these days that Gov.</p>
        <p>Michael S. Dukakis's lack of experience in foreign affairs disqualifies him for the Presidency. It is a little surprising to hear this thought on the lips of those who supported Ronald Reagan for the Presidency in 1980.</p>
        <p>George Bush, it is true, did observe during the 1980 primaries, ''We cannot take a chance on another President who has absolutely no experience in foreign affairs.'' But he took that chance and is presumably well satisfied now. Reaganites who apply the inexperience argument to Mr. Dukakis display bad memory or intellectual opportunism.</p>
        <p>The most effective foreign policy Presidents in this century - Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt - were state governors. Such successful diplomats as Averell Harriman, Adlai E. Stevenson and Chester Bowles were also governors. (The two Roosevelts had served in Washington during wartime as assistant secretaries of the Navy.) Mr. Dukakis has not lived a life devoid of international experience. He has spent time in Peru and South Korea, has visited the Far East, has often visited Europe and speaks more foreign languages than any single American President, Thomas Jefferson included, ever spoke.</p>
        <p>The argument about the indispensability of foreign policy ''experience'' implies two propositions: that foreign policy is so arcane that only long involvement in its making and execution can equip a person to handle the sacred mysteries, and, further, that past involvement provides a guarantee of superior wisdom in analysis and decision.</p>
        <p>Neither proposition stands up under scrutiny. Is foreign policy really all that esoteric and unfathomable? Of course, a professional priesthood has long claimed this to be the case, but its claim is designed to protect the priestly monopoly against intervention by members of Congress, journalists, professors, voters and other lesser breeds.</p>
        <p>Foreign policy does indeed require knowledge of other lands, concern for the national interest and steadiness of nerve. But anyone with political judgment, intellectual curiosity, a retentive memory, a disciplined temperament and sense of the way history runs can grasp the dynamics of foreign policy quickly enough.</p>
        <p>The idea that involvement guarantees wisdom is even more dubious. How much, after all, did Mr. Bush's eminent service in foreign affairs avail him when it came to the Philippines, Lebanon, the Iran-contra affair and Panama?</p>
        <p>What involvement more often guarantees is commitment to, and overinvestment in, obsolete opinion and entrenched error. The ''outsiders'' are not always wrong. Who made more sense about Southeast Asia 20 years ago, the National Security Council or the Senate Foreign Relations Committee? Which body makes more sense about Central American today?</p>
        <p>People with ''experience'' in foreign affairs can make dreadful misjudgments - and then not seldom they try to vindicate those misjudgments by expanding national commitments that may well have been mistaken in the first place. The last thing the Republic needs is a set of officials whose foreign policy ''experience'' lies in applauding, ratifying and extending error.</p>
        <p>Our world is in constant ferment. Nothing stands still. Ossified experience blinds people to the contours -to the threats and possibilities - of a planet in flux. As history spins the world along, America's position in the spinning world changes, too.</p>
        <p>We are no longer the undisputed top dog, numero uno, the big enchilada. Other nations no longer jump (or cry ''uncle'') when we crack the whip. Command in foreign affairs must give way to persuasion and collaboration.</p>
        <p>The decline in American competitiveness in world markets, our economy's growing dependence on injections of foreign capital, America's precarious position as the world's No. 1 debtor nation - all these developments make us more vulnerable economically than ever before.</p>
        <p>Ecological and biological threats surge across national frontiers: acid rain, ozone depletion, pollution of the seas, the greenhouse effect, drugs, AIDS - all enlarge our national security agenda. Familiar problems remain (the Russians, the nuclear arms race, regional conflicts), but striking new possibilities emerge - above all, for negotiation on a multitude of issues with the surprising new leadership in Moscow.</p>
        <p>Experience has its value but not when it sanctifies our perceptions of yesterday and blinds us to the dangers and hopes of tomorrow.</p>
