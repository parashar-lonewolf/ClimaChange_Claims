        <p>GENETIC engineering is frequently used to create drugs or practice biomedicine. Now a Texas company has patented a recombinant gene that it hopes will help eliminate acid rain.</p>
        <p>When sulfur is burned, sulfur oxides are produced; when these are released into the atmosphere they mix with rain, snow or mist and become sulfuric acid. This falls back to earth to pollute lakes, kill plants and even eat the paint off cars. A good deal of sulfur gets into the skies through the emissions of power plants, cars, trucks, trains or ships and other devices that burn fossil fuel.</p>
        <p>The Environmental Protection Agency wants oil refineries, power plants and the transportation industry to reduce sulfur emissions in the near future. The best way to do that may be to clean up the fuels as they are refined, well before they are burned in engines. Sulfur is among the most troublesome of the impurities found in fossil fuels as they come out of the ground.</p>
        <p>Scientists in Washington and North Dakota manipulated the DNA of soil bacteria of the genus Rhodococcusto to create an organism that eats and metabolizes sulfur. The Energy Biosystems Corporation of Woodlands, Tex., holds the patent for the new bacteria.</p>
        <p>"The bugs directly out of the soil aren't very interested in removing sulfur," said Daniel Monticello, the company's vice president for research. Rhodococcus bacteria present no danger to humans.</p>
        <p>"You have to do some manipulating of the organism to convince it to consume sulfur at the high rate needed in industrial levels," he explained. He said researchers had cloned the genes that controlled the bacteria's appetite, then altered them so that eating sulfur became "its primary goal in life."</p>
        <p>The newly programmed bacteria are mixed with water and added to fossil fuels that have sulfur. Once they have eaten the sulfur, they will be filtered out of the cleaned oil and re-used.</p>
        <p>Mr. Monticello said his company was looking at ways to inject the bacteria into crude oil for Texaco, Koch Refining and Total S.A., the French oil and gas company. He said he hoped the bacteria would replace the expensive, high-energy refining process now used to remove sulfur from fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>Energy Biosystems received patent 5,256,801. But Who Will Carve The Virtual Turkey?</p>
        <p>The Thanksgiving of the future may not require tortured travel through busy airports or crowded freeways. Instead, far-flung brothers and sisters may sit back at their home computers and watch themselves on their monitors as they dig into turkey and stuffing at Mom and Dad's miles away.</p>
        <p>Using Tohei Nitta's animated electronic meeting place, they will be able to move around the on-line dinner table, talk to one another and choose jellied cranberry sauce or the kind with whole berries.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nitta is president of Mitsubishi Electronic Research Laboratories Inc. The company, based in Cambridge, Mass., is a subsidiary of the huge Japanese electronics company.</p>
        <p>Video-conferencing systems now let businesses hold on-line meetings among people in different offices or cities. Mr. Nitta's design lets people play games, teach in classrooms or gather socially, and in his system both the setting and participants are animated.</p>
        <p>"A picture moving in real time requires sending too much data," Mr. Nitta explained. It also means each terminal has to have a camera.</p>
        <p>With Mr. Nitta's software, a user would sit at his computer and through a communications network like the Internet dial up siblings who have the same program. A photo of the setting -- Mom and Dad's dining room, for example --is sent, as are photos of all the participants. The operating system translates them into animation.</p>
        <p>"To create the animated pictures, we'll have to have a little more sophisticated system, a more high-performance, more powerful computer" for each user, said Mr. Nitta, whose working prototype runs on a Silicon Graphics system. "An I.B.M. PC at this moment would not be enough."</p>
        <p>The computers will have microphones so everyone can talk, and each person would control his or her character's physical movement and facial expression through a positioning system being developed with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Mr. Nitta said. He described it as something between a mouse and a joystick.</p>
        <p>The range of motion and facial expression is limited by the software programming. So while brothers and sisters might argue over the last of the pumpkin pie, they cannot -- yet -- come to blows.</p>
        <p>"This new idea will give us a new tool for communication between telephone conversations and face-to-face meetings," Mr. Nitta said.</p>
        <p>The system won patent 5,347,306. A Pressurized Bag For Thirsty Cyclists</p>
        <p>Thirsty cyclists can snap water bottles onto bike frames or strap drinking pouches around their waists but may have to slow down, take their eyes off the road or even stop to take a sip.</p>
        <p>William Holmes, president of Upstream Products in Piedmont, Calif., manufactures a waist-belt drinking pouch. He hopes to improve it with an insulated drinking bag that requires no distracting handling or deep sucking by a winded rider. The pouch can be mounted on the frame, the handlebars or under the seat.</p>
        <p>"Inside is a collapsible bag with just one opening," Mr. Holmes explained. A drinking tube comes out of the bottom of the pouch and stretches to the handlebars, where it is attached so that a rider can lean down and drink.</p>
        <p>"Around the collapsible bag is an elastic Lycra Spandex bag," Mr. Holmes continued. "The bicyclist blows through the tube. The air goes up through the liquid and expands the outer and inner bags together."</p>
        <p>That pressure forces the liquid into the drinking tube. A clamp prevents leaking until a rider takes a drink.</p>
        <p>"When you open the clamp, cold liquid flows up the tube to the lips," Mr. Holmes said. "One puff will bring up more than one cup of cold liquid. We use a 1.5-to-2-quart container, so usually a few puffs will empty the whole thing."</p>
        <p>The bag sells for $60 and has already been used by cyclists crossing the Sahara. Mr. Holmes wants a manufacturing partner to make pouches for sport bikers, racers and people in wheelchairs.</p>
        <p>His patent is 5,358,142.</p>
