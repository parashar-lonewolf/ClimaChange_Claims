        <p>One moment all was quiet, and the Chugach Range stood out in the snowcapped splendor of a timeless winter scene. The next, recalled Keith Burton, a track-repair man for the Alaska Railroad, ''it was like a huge billowy cloud just jumped right off the mountains and started rolling straight down toward us.''</p>
        <p>The few seconds that Mr. Burton had to grab his radio and shout ''Avalanche!'' were not enough for another worker, Kerry Brookman, who was operating a bulldozer to clear snow from the tracks that run south from Anchorage along the Turnagain Arm, a waterway that flows toward the Kenai Peninsula.</p>
        <p>The moving wall of snow slammed straight into the 38,000-pound bulldozer, sweeping man and machine nearly 200 yards, out onto the frozen mud flats of the Arm. The crumpled dozer landed upside down, its tracks in the air, and although his frantic co-workers managed to find Mr. Brookman still conscious -- ''I'm O.K., I'll be all right,'' he said -- he died of internal trauma soon afterward.</p>
        <p>This was one of at least 33 major avalanches that have struck south-central Alaska in recent weeks, a cycle of fury and danger that, even by the standards of a state where awesome natural power is continually on display, has been extraordinary.</p>
        <p>The massive slides, two of which have been a mile wide, are a product of an unusual weather pattern of thawing and freezing that created virtual shelves of ice on mountaintops earlier this winter. By late January, extremely heavy snowfalls were accumulating on those glacial shelves, creating conditions for what one state expert describes as ''hundred-year avalanches.''</p>
        <p>Two have proved deadly -- the one that killed Mr. Brookman, 53, on Feb. 1 and one on Jan. 26 that struck just outside the town of Cordova on Prince William Sound, flattening several homes and warehouses and killing Martha Quales, 63.</p>
        <p>Several others have played havoc, blocking  the Seward Highway, the link between Anchorage and all the towns on the Kenai Peninsula,  for five days earlier this month and cutting off electricity to thousands of the peninsula's residents.</p>
        <p>Still other slides, far from much human habitation, have simply been spectacular to behold, in either their occurrence or their aftermath, the power unleashed akin to that of a volcano.</p>
        <p>''It's like nothing I've ever seen, short of visiting Mount St. Helens,'' Dan Amyot, a ranger at Chugach State Park, said of an early February avalanche near Eklutna Lake, north of Anchorage, that snapped thousands of two-foot-thick aspens and cottonwoods and created a mile-long field of debris near the base of 7,500-foot Bold Peak. ''It's a whole forest laid down like toothpicks.''</p>
        <p>Gov. Tony Knowles has declared the region a disaster area and sought federal help. Property damage caused by the avalanches has been estimated at more than $16 million so far, said  Phil Oates, adjutant general of the Alaska National Guard. And nervous state officials say that depending on the weather over the next several weeks, the problem could actually get worse as spring approaches.</p>
        <p>''We feel that we're not done yet,'' said John Horn, regional director of the Alaska Department of Transportation. ''There are a lot of slopes that haven't released any snow yet, and when the warm spring sun hits, we're concerned there could be more problems. There's just a whole lot of snow up there in the mountains.''</p>
        <p>While some avalanches are predictable -- conditions in any number of locations are frequently just right for them -- many others strike without warning, quickly reaching speeds of 125 miles an hour or more and leaving debris fields 200 feet high.</p>
        <p>Everyone here recognizes the continuing danger, especially on the Seward Highway. The road runs for miles just beneath the 3,000-foot-high faces of several mountains in the Chugach Range, which are all building up huge piles of snow and can, without warning, shed them down their steep slopes.</p>
        <p>Even in less perilous times, the Seward Highway is among the most avalanche-prone travel routes anywhere in the nation. It is so susceptible to slides that the state sometimes tries, as at a number of other locations, to let them loose before nature does, with howitzers and with explosives that crews drop from planes and helicopters.</p>
        <p>''It's called avalanche control, which is a little presumptuous, of course,'' said Bill Glude, a consultant to the state who is director of the  Southeast Alaska Avalanche Center. ''It's really an attempt at mitigation. The bombs, if you drop them in the right spot, provide enough of a shock load to trigger an avalanche.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Glude has been crisscrossing south-central Alaska in recent weeks, helping state officials figure out where and when to set off the explosives. Highways and railroad tracks are closed to traffic when such work is done. Then the resulting snow and debris are cleared, and the transportation corridors reopened.</p>
        <p>Whether such work can stave off more snowy turmoil remains to be seen. There is clearly a huge amount of snow around here, both up in the mountains and even down below. Here in Girdwood, a ski resort about 40 miles south of Anchorage, the plowed snow rises in some places as high as street signs, and walking through town can feel like negotiating a maze.</p>
        <p>After rains and a thawing period followed by the freeze, huge amounts of snow started falling in January. Anchorage, which normally gets about 9 inches of snow in January, recorded 34 inches, according to the National Weather Service. And even more fell here in Girdwood.</p>
        <p>''We're used to snow, but this was just incredible,'' said Todd Hiibner, manager of World Cup, a store here that sells skiing equipment. ''Even before the avalanches came, they had to close down the Alyeska Ski Resort for a while. There was literally just too much snow. You couldn't ski in it; you'd just sink in it to your waist if you tried.''</p>
        <p>And there was so much snow one morning that Bob Mucha, owner of Chugach Express, which operates dog-sled tours here in town, had to dig his 40 Alaskan huskies out of their doghouses.</p>
        <p>Climate experts here can trace the unusual cycle to storms in the Pacific but cannot say at this point whether it is related to larger climatic factors like global warming. There is wide agreement, though, that in the words of Mike Maillet, a maintenance foreman for the Alaska Railroad, ''It's just been a strange year, the thaws, the cold, then lots of snow.''</p>
        <p>And while avalanches kill people who venture into remote areas nearly every year -- there were 11 such deaths across Alaska last year, most involving snowmobilers -- the slides this year are unusual for killing people in inhabited areas. In Cordova, Mayor Ed Zeine said recently that the city would consider rezoning the area where Ms. Quales was killed, to prevent new building there.</p>
        <p>''There were houses completely blown to smithereens, cars tipped over, mature trees ripped out and thrown out onto the lake,'' Mr. Glude said of the Cordova slide. ''It was really quite amazing. It was a very graphic demonstration of the power of nature.''</p>
