        <p>Canadian industries must cut the rate at which they produce gases linked to global warming by 18 percent over the next three years, the federal government said Thursday.</p>
        <p>While the new plan offers an accelerated timetable compared to an earlier proposal from the Conservative government, it falls well short of the country's commitments under the Kyoto protocol on climate change.</p>
        <p>Even before hearing public reaction, the environment minister, John Baird, acknowledged that the plan, which calls for a total reduction of greenhouse-related gases by 2020, would be criticized.</p>
        <p>''Our plan strikes a balance between the perfection that some environmentalists may be seeking and the status quo that some in the industry seek to protect,'' he said at a news conference in Toronto.</p>
        <p>Large emitters of industrial greenhouse gas that are unable to meet the timetable will have other options, including contributing to a fund that will be used to develop pollution control technologies at an initial rate of 15 Canadian dollars a metric ton for emissions beyond their target. Companies will also be given credit for emission reductions that they have achieved from 1992 through last year.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Jayson Myers, the chief economist for Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, an Ottawa-based trade group, said that many companies would struggle with the plan, particularly during the first three years.</p>
        <p>''It is going to be very difficult for companies to meet these targets,'' Mr. Myers said, adding that paperwork associated with the program will add to corporate costs.</p>
        <p>But several environmental groups said that because the 18 percent reduction is tied to units of production, not overall output, total greenhouse emissions in Canada may continue to rise.</p>
        <p>Stephen Hazell, executive director of the Sierra Club of Canada, said that Alberta's oil sands projects, which are an increasingly important energy source for the United States, would probably increase production by twice the rate they are required to curb per-unit gas emissions during the three-year period.</p>
        <p>''The use reductions based on emission intensity is deceptive,'' Mr. Hazell said. ''In the oil sands, we may see overall emissions still increasing by 4 to 6 percent a year.''</p>
        <p>Pierre R. Alvarez, the president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, however, rejected suggestions that his industry would not make a significant contribution or face significant costs.</p>
        <p>''This is the toughest target the oil and gas industry will face in the world, at least in the short term,'' Mr. Alvarez said.</p>
        <p>The government's plan for the auto industry is less clear. Mr. Baird said that Canada would work with the United States to develop a continental fuel efficiency standard that could become effective in 2011.</p>
        <p>Basel E. Hargrove, the president of the Canadian Auto Workers Union, said he was relieved that the government did not attempt to establish a special standard for Canada. Because most automobiles made in Canada are exported to the United States, Mr. Hargrove said that special Canadian rules might have prompted manufacturers to curb Canadian production.</p>
        <p>Over all, Mr. Baird estimated that meeting the targets would cost the Canadian economy about 7 billion to 8 billion Canadian dollars a year, an amount that Mr. Myers said may be understated.</p>
        <p>Despite that expense, if the plan works as forecast environmental groups said that Canada would be 8 to 13 years late in meeting its Kyoto commitments.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baird, however, said that those targets, which were agreed to by a previous Liberal government, were unrealistic.</p>
