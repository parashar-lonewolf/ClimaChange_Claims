        <p>LEAD: President Bush could extend his promising environmental record by abandoning an ill-conceived scheme to speed the deforestation of the United States - already far advanced - for the benefit of Japan.</p>
        <p>President Bush could extend his promising environmental record by abandoning an ill-conceived scheme to speed the deforestation of the United States - already far advanced - for the benefit of Japan.</p>
        <p>Most Americans are acutely aware of the environmental folly of Brazil in cutting, burning and inundating so much of its vast rain forest land in the name of economic progress. But few realize that the United States, which similarly cleared away most of its forests in the 19th century, is still doing it.</p>
        <p>What's more, too much of our remaining timberlands are being cut to build houses for the Japanese, at the cost of American jobs as well as the American environment. In the past decade, logs equivalent to a 600,000-acre forest were shipped overseas; last year alone, exports - mostly to Japan - consumed one in four logs cut on the West Coast and in Alaska.</p>
        <p>The pace of this continued American deforestation will increase, in the worst possible places, if Mr. Bush stands by an export proposal in the Federal budget that President Reagan submitted in January. It would permit raw logs from the national forests to be shipped directly to Japan and other countries.</p>
        <p>Under budget restrictions in effect for 21 years, foreign buyers may not bid on timber grown in U.S. national forests. The Reagan proposal to drop this ban - which has to be renewed annually - was first estimated to trim the Federal deficit by $833 million by 1994; more rigorous Congressional examination has reduced that estimate to about $222 million.</p>
        <p>Even at the original figure, the savings - plus a favorable but minor effect on the trade deficit - would be obtained only at high cost to American timber workers, old-growth forests, recreation, wildlife and efforts to slow global warming. Not only environmentalists but American sawmill interests (already disadvantaged by timber exports) oppose the Reagan proposal, which Mr. Bush unwisely carried over to his revised budget.</p>
        <p>Now the Office of Management and Budget is reported to be reconsidering. For the President, the political cost of axing the Reagan proposal could come only from major timber exporters, if from anyone, since the Japanese don't yet vote here.</p>
        <p>The environmental gain to the United States would be considerable. Already the national forests are under heavy pressure from big lumber interests. As these companies mow down trees on their own lands and on state tracts to feed the hungry export market, they naturally look with covetous eyes on timber - often of higher quality - remaining in the national forests.</p>
        <p>Smaller American milling companies, meanwhile, find themselves unable to match the bids of foreign buyers for U.S. logs. That means mill closings throughout the Northwest, for example, since export logs typically move directly from the forest to foreign ports, never having been touched by American sawmill workers. This adds to high rates of unemployment in some areas that are heavily dependent upon the forest industry.</p>
        <p>The log shortage for American mills also produces new pressures from them for greater access to timber in the national forests. They don't want to ship logs overseas; they want to keep their own mills humming. National forest timber, these loggers say, is all that's available to undo the domestic log shortage caused by exports.</p>
        <p>Already, Government-owned timber - trees on national forest land supposedly belonging to the American people - is being logged at record rates. Timothy Egan reported yesterday in The New York Times that in the Northwest alone, 5.5 billion board feet were cut from 19 national forests in 1988 - 20 percent more than 10 years ago. In 1987, 12.7 billion board feet were stripped from the 156 national forests across the country.</p>
        <p>Earlier, Ronald Smothers reported in The Times that the U.S. Forest Service planned to double allowable timber sales in six national forests in the Southern Appalachians. An annual average of just under 100 million board feet was cut from 1977 through 1986; under the Forest Service plan, by 1996 over 200 million board feet would be harvested yearly.</p>
        <p>That increased cutting is bound to be caused at least in part by vast timber shipments moving abroad. These exports mean that the domestic market must rely more and more on logs cut from Pisgah and Nantahala and all the other national timberlands, particularly the great old forests of the Northwest. Why open these national treasures directly to foreign buyers?</p>
        <p>Stay tuned for more on the deforestation of America.</p>
