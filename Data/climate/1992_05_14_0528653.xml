        <p>Sharpening its differences with the United States on environmental policies, the European Community proposed today that a high energy tax be imposed on all forms of fuel to limit pollution and global warming.</p>
        <p>The proposal, which is one of the community's most ambitious fiscal and environmental moves so far, appears to be intended as the calling card the 12-nation group will present at the Earth Summit meeting in Rio de Janeiro next month.</p>
        <p>So far, the step takes the form of a recommendation by the community's Brussels-based executive commission and will require approval by the 12 community member nations as well as the European Parliament before it becomes law.</p>
        <p>But, suggesting that the proposal may also be used as a bargaining position at the Earth Summit, the commission proposed that the new tax only be adopted if Western Europe's major trading partners -- the United States and Japan -- adopt a similar measure.</p>
        <p>Under the proposal, European governments would levy a tax on fossil fuels -- coal, oil and gas -- and all other forms of energy except that produced by sun, waves or wind. It would be introduced in 1993 at the rate of $3 per barrel of oil, or its equivalent in other fuels, with the tax rising by $1 per year to reach $10 in the year 2000.</p>
        <p>By driving up fuel costs, the plan aims to force users to become more efficient and save energy, one of the main objectives of the current European rethinking of its economic and industrial policies. Community studies argue that with existing technology, energy efficiency can be increased at little extra cost by 25 percent. The proposed taxes will be highest for the dirtiest form of energy, coal, followed by oil. Taxes on natural gas would be the lowest and biomass fuel would be exempted.</p>
        <p>The proposal, which has been studied and debated for more than two years, forms the basis of the community's strategy to slow pollution and global warming. The group has committed itself to keeping emissions of gases tied to global warming at 1990 levels. The United States has balked at setting such targets, which has caused a longstanding deadlock between American and European negotiators preparing a treaty to slow global warming.</p>
        <p>If the European Community takes no measures, experts say that its emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, would be 12 percent higher by the year 2000. It hopes to achieve half of the needed cutback through the proposed "energy taxes" and the rest through other measures. The community is responsible for 13 percent of of global carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
        <p>But the plan, formally announced in Strasbourg today, was unlikely to satisfy everyone. There has been bitter opposition from industrialists who assert that such additional taxes will hamper their competitiveness. That was the main reason why the community executive today said the tax would not be levied until major trading partners took the same step.</p>
        <p>Officials said that would increase pressure on the United States, Japan and others to accept concrete measures to limit their emissions. But privately, officials said environmental ministers and politicians would press hard for the European Community to adopt their plan even if others did not make such moves.</p>
