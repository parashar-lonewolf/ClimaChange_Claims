        <p>ON a chilly and sodden afternoon last week, Christina Vrachnos braced herself against the wind on Madison Avenue, and cast her eyes toward the skies. ''Is it global warming?'' she wailed. ''What is it? What have we done to deserve this wretched weather?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Vrachnos, who works in the marketing department of a financial publishing company, had suited up to brave temperatures that had dipped into the low 50's -- a black wool coat, trousers and a fake Burberry plaid hat.

''I haven't been able to wear half the things I bought for spring,'' she said with a shudder.</p>

        <p>ON a chilly and sodden afternoon last week, Christina Vrachnos braced herself against the wind on Madison Avenue, and cast her eyes toward the skies. ''Is it global warming?'' she wailed. ''What is it? What have we done to deserve this wretched weather?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Vrachnos, who works in the marketing department of a financial publishing company, had suited up to brave temperatures that had dipped into the low 50's -- a black wool coat, trousers and a fake Burberry plaid hat. In her mind the outfit was a betrayal of the candy-colored skirt and open-toe sandals she had recently purchased, now sitting useless in her closet. ''I haven't been able to wear half the things I bought for spring,'' she said with a shudder.</p>
        <p>On the opposite end of Manhattan, Shira Sagol, an artist, had pulled out a chubby fur jacket for a trip to NoLIta. Hugging close the fur that was her defense against the chill, she groused, ''Sure, New York weather is unpredictable, but this is a little extreme.''</p>
        <p>Indeed it is. As New Yorkers endure one of the coldest springs in decades, with weekends serially washed out by rain, they have sullenly pressed winter wardrobes into extended duty while wistfully eyeing the Miu Miu floral frocks and Donna Karan polka-dot sundresses they are unable to wear. Many have put aside summer clothes for pilling sweaters and frayed corduroys that had been marked for storage. Sandal-ready pedicures have been summarily smothered in socks. Sleek, waxed-for-the-beach legs are covered in nylon. Even the hardiest spirits have been forced to scour their closets for comfort wear -- the turtlenecks, hoodies, mufflers and parkas that are the sartorial equivalent of tomato-rice soup.</p>
        <p>''I've even emptied my dresser a couple of times to make room for spring,'' said Rona Tison, the owner of an Upper East Side boutique, who twice this season has pushed her winter clothes to the back of her closet, only to pull them back out.</p>
        <p>''That's quite an ordeal you know, when you live in a small Manhattan apartment,'' Ms. Tison said.</p>
        <p>According to the National Weather Service, the average temperature in New York for May, a customarily balmy month, has been an inhospitable 58.7 -- several degrees below normal. More telling, however, is that for the first time in 20 years there was not a day in May when the thermometer hit 80. And June has been worse, treating East Coasters to an unrelenting deluge worthy of a Peter Weir movie. Over the first five days of June, New York has received 4.35 inches of rain, more than the average in most years for the entire month.</p>
        <p>Ms. Tison, like some others in New York City, has lost her appetite for shopping for anything new.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to get a gift for a friend,'' she said. ''There are all these beautiful summer skin treatments and cosmetics. But who would appreciate them right now?''</p>
        <p>Sentiments like those have some merchants wringing their hands. ''It's hard to sell summer clothes when everyone is still in sweaters,'' said Heidi Humes, the owner of Pipsqueak, a children's boutique on Mott Street. Ms. Humes puffed dejectedly on a cigarette as she surveyed the near-empty store.</p>
        <p>At Sigerson Morrison, on Prince Street, thong sandals and open-toe pumps are generally tough to keep in stock at this time of year. Last week, however, there were plenty. ''Few people come in during the rain -- they're too depressed,'' said Mandy Misagal, the manager. Of course there is the occasional client who shops when she is blue, Ms. Misagal noted with relief, adding: ''She is the shopping therapy person. I tell her, 'Sit down, let's talk it through.' ''</p>
        <p>Clothing retailers who expected a bounce in consumer spending after the Iraq war ended were let down when unseasonably cold weather gave shoppers another reason to sit on their wallets. ''The fact that we've had rainy weather for most of May didn't sell bathing suits and shorts,'' said Dana Telsey, an analyst with Bear, Stearns. ''Buying goods in season is what should happen, but to see summer inventories cleared, we need a little sunshine.''</p>
        <p>Not all was gloom, however. Aggressive markdowns and cabin fever did improve sales in some stores. At BCBG Max Azria on Madison Avenue, early sales drew a trickle of shoppers, some pawing over $66 T-shirts reduced by half, and bamboo-patterned dresses, their $152 price tags slashed 30 percent.</p>
        <p>Outside urban areas, especially in the Northeast, the weather was actually an impetus to shop, driving some to seek refuge in malls, according to retail figures for May released last week. Apparel merchants there reported modest sales gains compared with May a year ago.</p>
        <p>Shop or not, a few resilient souls were determined to tough out the storm. Moishe Hach, a New York physician, warded off the chill in a wax-coated Burberry topper, a wool suit and black leather boots. ''You can't fight the weather; it is what it is,'' he said, shrugging.</p>
        <p>Nor was Gina de Franco, a fashion publicist, about to let a little dampness rain on her parade. She had just left a party, dressed in a woolly pink Chanel suit, high-heel canvas boots and a picture hat that stood in for an umbrella. She had planned to save the hat for the races at Ascot this month, but decided to wear it on Wednesday. Jutting out her chin, she said, ''I'm determined to have spring today.''</p>
