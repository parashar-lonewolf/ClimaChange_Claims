        <p>IT is a warm, luminous day, and the prairies and woodlands of the Cedar Creek Natural History Area, 30 miles north of the Twin Cities, are buzzing with life. Crickets chirp. Bees and butterflies float from bloom to bloom amid scores of species of grassland plants carpeting the flatlands that run between groves of trees presided over by stately bur oaks two centuries old.</p>
        <p>The nine-square-mile tract, some of it undisturbed since before Europeans arrived in these parts, and some of it in various stages of recovery from decades of farming, is a fragment of the mosaic of tallgrass prairie and oak savanna that once covered great stretches of the country's midsection. But this swatch of the mosaic is special, as Dr. G. David Tilman, an ecologist at the University of Minnesota, is about to demonstrate.</p>
        <p>Dr. Tilman points to a brilliant green square on the ground that is thick with short, curly grass, much thicker and greener than the vegetation on neighboring plots. Intuition might suggest that the thick green plot represents the healthier chunk of the ecosystem. Not so, as Dr. Tilman has shown in one of scores of revealing and ambitious experiments -- the combination of their large scale and long duration may be unique -- for which he has become known.</p>
        <p>In this case, he added varying amounts of nitrogen, a powerful fertilizer, to different plots to determine the nutrient's effect on the ecosystem's functioning. It is a question of some import, since human activities like farming and the burning of fossil fuels are dumping nitrogen wholesale into the biosphere.</p>
        <p>Among the pearls of ecological evidence that have so far emerged from the Tilman experiments are these:</p>
        <p>*As nitrogen rises, the number of plant species declines; the thick green grass, a species called quack grass, which happens to proliferate wildly in high-nitrogen soil, has crowded out other species in its plot.</p>
        <p>*As the number of species declines, so does the total production of biomass, the amount of plant material as measured by dry weight.</p>
        <p>*The decline in diversity of species also makes the impact of drought on the ecosystem much worse; the more species there are, Dr. Tilman says, the more chance there is that some will be drought-resistant.</p>
        <p>*If enough nitrogen is added, it pushes the ecosystem into increasingly chaotic oscillations culminating in a crash of plant populations.</p>
        <p>*When these high-nitrogen plants crash, die and decompose, more nitrate leaks into the soil and then into ground water and surface runoff, possibly impairing water quality and promoting harmful blooms of algae.</p>
        <p>The main message sent by these results, Dr. Tilman says, is that the more species there are in an ecosystem (up to a point), the more productive, resilient and stable it will be. This is a question of some  importance for conservation policy, given a running political debate over whether it is important to preserve as many species as possible.</p>
        <p>But the Tilman experiments may have an even more basic value to the young science of ecology. Controlled experimentation -- in which the experimenter essentially attempts to hold all variables constant except the one whose effect is being tested -- is routine in many sciences, but until relatively recently it had not been widely employed by ecologists. Even now most such ecological experiments are small and short. Dr. Tilman thinks big and long-term: His manipulations of the prairie-savanna ecosystem have involved some 140 experiments over the last 17 years, with scores to hundreds of plots in each experiment and many of the investigations lasting for years. About 35 are now in progress.</p>
        <p>What Dr. Tilman often does, said Dr. Stuart Pimm, an ecologist at the University of Tennessee, is take a snippet of an idea that may have been around for a while and subject it to ''an incredibly well-replicated and thought-out experiment, and you say, 'Yeah, that's it, he's nailed that one down.' ''</p>
        <p>''It makes it very compelling, very exciting,'' Dr. Pimm said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Peter Kareiva, an ecologist at the University of Washington in Seattle, said many scientists would not even attempt Dr. Tilman's work. ''They say it can't work, it's too complicated, or there are too many confounding factors in the experiment,'' Dr. Kareiva said.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Tilman is an ebullient optimist -- words pour from him in a torrent of enthusiasm -- and Dr. Kareiva says it is this optimism that drives the ambitious experimentation.</p>
        <p>Dr. Tilman's goal is to help make ecology a rigorous mathematics-based discipline like, say, physics. He wants to reduce the principles of ecosystem function to mathematical  equations that scientists can use to predict how nature will behave under varying conditions.</p>
        <p>Success in this effort would be a boon to ecology, where efforts to conserve and restore natural landscapes are often based more on educated guesswork than on firmly delineated and codified scientific principles.</p>
        <p>Many other ecologists doubt that the complexities of ecology can ever be reduced to a few general principles. Dr. Tilman believes they can, and his method, a classic one in the hard sciences, is to formulate a theory (expressed graphically in this case), reduce it to equations, then test it on the ground at Cedar Creek.  Usually, he says, the theory turns out to be partly right and partly wrong.  So then it is is time to reformulate the theory. And so on.</p>
        <p>Many associates praise Dr. Tilman's willingness to experiment and to risk being wrong so boldly. ''Dave does not lack for guts in terms of  putting his money where his mouth is,'' said Dr. Mark Schwartz, a former Tilman student who is now an ecologist at the University of California at Davis.</p>
        <p>Dr. Tilman himself sees the question of sometimes being wrong a little differently. For him, the part of the theory that turns out to be wrong opens the way to further understanding. ''Where things fall apart,'' he says, ''is where I get excited.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Tilman, 49, started out to be a physicist. But in his undergraduate years at the University of Michigan in the late 1960's, he came to believe that the biggest and most interesting questions in physics had already been answered.</p>
        <p>What to do? He had always had a love of biology and of the natural world. As one of four children growing up in a beach home near St. Joseph, Mich., he went to sleep to the sound of Lake Michigan lapping the shoreline. In Little League, where he was not a bad player, his teammates called him the Professor; he was often less interested in the game than in the flowers and bugs in the outfield.</p>
        <p>So it was natural that his search for an alternative to physics should lead him to biology, and in turn to ecology, a science, he says, that ''reminded me of what it must have felt like to have been Newton or others back in the early days of physics.'' In ecology, big questions still remained unanswered; masses of information from the field awaited rigorous analysis and a theoretical framework to explain it. And there was the added bonus of ecology's role in helping preserve the environment.</p>
        <p>For his Ph.D. thesis at Michigan, he plunged immediately into the world of experimental ecology. Intrigued and disturbed by the growth of algae in Lake Michigan, he studied the response of scores of the lake's different algal species to their two main nutrients, phosphate and silicate. He tested each species in the laboratory and found that each required a different ratio of the two nutrients.</p>
        <p>Reasoning that the ratio of the nutrients in the lake varied enormously, he figured that the number of algal species the lake could support was likewise enormous, since each could find the ratio it needed at a different point in the water. He reduced this concept to predictive equations, and it was soon being used  by Federal water quality regulators.</p>
        <p>In 1976, at the age of 26, he arrived  at the University of Minnesota with his wife, Cathie (they now have four children, aged 9 to 21). Within a week of taking up his position as an assistant professor, he was walking around the grasslands of Cedar Creek, and soon concluded that the prairie was even better than a lake for investigating the relationship between nutrient amounts and species diversity: ''Soil sits there year after year,'' he says, ''and you can measure exactly what a plant is experiencing.''</p>
        <p>From the start, his experiments focussed on the basic mechanics, as it were, of ecosystem functioning.  His underlying assumption was (and is) that the structure of ecosystems is controlled by two major processes: interaction between consumers and the resources they consume (plants and nutrients, for instance, or predators and prey) and the recycling of nutrients (as in decomposition of dead material). And so Dr. Tilman and his fellow experimenters set to work, dividing expanses of  ground into control and experimental plots, blocking them off from each other when necessary, and then manipulating variables like species composition, nutrients and soil fungi.</p>
        <p>The main focus of the experiments has been on what controls diversity  of species and how diversity affects the functioning of ecosystems.</p>
        <p>The largest, most rigorously controlled test, now under way, is called BioCon. It involves 340 experimental plots on 20 acres of Cedar Creek land. In 1993 the experimenters employed road scrapers, plows and disks to scrub the plots (they had once been farmland) clean of weeds and invasive species. Then they seeded the plots with native prairie plants, varying the number of species from 1 to 32 per plot and choosing the species in each plot at random.</p>
        <p>The plan is to follow all the plots for several years and record the abundance of each species through time. ''These experiments are slow,'' Dr. Tilman says. ''It's five or so years before you trust many of the results.'' That is, until the components settle into some sort of long-term equilibrium, they may send false signals about how the ecosystem works.</p>
        <p>The researchers are also investigating a number of ecosystem dynamics. Does diversity make a difference in plants' susceptibility to disease, for instance? There is reason, Dr. Tilman says, to believe that low diversity increases vulnerability. The idea is that the lower the diversity, the more abundant are the plants of any one species, and the closer they are together, allowing disease -- in this case, fungal diseases -- to spread from one plant to another.</p>
        <p>At one plot, a doctoral candidate, Charles Mitchell, was picking through a thick stand of little bluestem grass, estimating the percentage of leaves and leaf area covered by the telltale brown-rust spots of fungal disease. He had already looked at thousands of plants and was entering the data as he collected it on the keyboard of a hand-held computer. (Twenty years ago, notes Dr. Tilman, the lack of computer capacity would have made it impossible to analyze the mass of data he and his students are collecting.)</p>
        <p>A few yards away, perhaps a dozen people weeded plots to keep the experiments from being clouded by invasive plants. And in one spot,  whooshing, computer-controlled jets of air loaded with carbon dioxide continually adjusted the amount of the gas flooding an experimental plot  to keep it at about double the pre-industrial concentration. Here, the idea is to manipulate both carbon dioxide and nitrogen, two chemicals with which humans are flooding the biosphere, to determine their combined effects on plant diversity.</p>
        <p>There are many more variables being looked at as well, and the lush,  unruly, highly complex mixture of  plants that make up the prairie at Cedar Creek vividly raises the question of whether it is really possible, out in nature, to control everything that needs to be controlled in a valid way.</p>
        <p>Dr. Schwartz notes, for instance, that weeding the plots changes the amount of biomass in them, and this, he says, introduces an experimental weakness. Other scientists say that hidden variables, unrecognized and unaccounted for by the experimenter, may produce misleading results.</p>
        <p>''You just can't control everything,'' Dr. Schwartz says. Moreover, he is one of those who questions whether it is possible to boil ecosystem behavior down to a few relatively simple mathematical equations.  The attempt to do so, he said, is ''good for ecology, but I also think it's realistic to think it may be more complicated than that.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Pimm, the Tennessee ecologist, for one, believes it is better to try ''than just to throw your hands up and say it's impossible.'' And in fact, he said, ''David has shown that a lot of the things we thought were impossible can be reduced to patterns.''</p>
