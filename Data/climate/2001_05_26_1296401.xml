      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial says one of more troubling proposals in Pres Bush's new energy plan is directive ordering federal officials to review Clean Air Act provisions to see whether rules governing pollution from power plants and refineries should be applied more leniently or even suspended in order to increase energy supplies; calls on Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Christie Whitman to nonetheless continue campaign to crack down on these polluters</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>One of the more troubling proposals in President Bush's new energy plan is a directive ordering federal officials to review an important law governing air pollution from power plants and refineries. The idea, pushed hard by such energy giants as Southern and Exxon, is to see whether this law should be applied more leniently or even suspended in order to increase supplies of electricity and natural gas. But there is no good reason to ease these rules. Keeping them in place will test the resolve of Christie Whitman, the Environmental Protection Agency boss, who has already had more than her share of run-ins with the White House.</p>
        <p>The law at issue is a provision of the Clean Air Act requiring power plants and refineries that make major upgrades to take steps to prevent additional pollution, either by installing new controls or by making reductions elsewhere at the same plant. The main targets are hundreds of old, coal-fired power plants that were exempted from the act's strict pollution controls in the expectation that they would soon be closed. But nearly all of them are still very much in business, spewing out pollutants that contribute heavily to smog, acid rain, global warming and mercury contamination. The law requiring strict controls on old plants whenever they undergo major renovation is one of the few ways the government has to curb increases in these pollutants.</p>

        <p>One of the more troubling proposals in President Bush's new energy plan is a directive ordering federal officials to review an important law governing air pollution from power plants and refineries. The idea, pushed hard by such energy giants as Southern and Exxon, is to see whether this law should be applied more leniently or even suspended in order to increase supplies of electricity and natural gas. But there is no good reason to ease these rules. Keeping them in place will test the resolve of Christie Whitman, the Environmental Protection Agency boss, who has already had more than her share of run-ins with the White House.</p>
        <p>The law at issue is a provision of the Clean Air Act requiring power plants and refineries that make major upgrades to take steps to prevent additional pollution, either by installing new controls or by making reductions elsewhere at the same plant. The main targets are hundreds of old, coal-fired power plants that were exempted from the act's strict pollution controls in the expectation that they would soon be closed. But nearly all of them are still very much in business, spewing out pollutants that contribute heavily to smog, acid rain, global warming and mercury contamination. The law requiring strict controls on old plants whenever they undergo major renovation is one of the few ways the government has to curb increases in these pollutants.</p>
        <p>The utilities and the oil companies argue that the investments required to comply with the law have deterred them from expanding capacity to produce more electricity and, in the case of refineries, gasoline. The argument has gained currency at a time when California is experiencing energy shortages and when motorists are paying higher prices for gasoline. But so far, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, there is no evidence that companies obeying the rules have been prevented from expanding.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, there is plenty of evidence that many companies have expanded their plants without paying any attention to the law -- saving themselves money but adding to air pollution. In separate actions over the last two years, New York's attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, and Carol Browner, Mrs. Whitman's predecessor at the E.P.A., sued more than 30 coal-fired power plants for expanding their operations without taking the anti-pollution steps required by law.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer has reached agreements in principle with two major power producers in Virginia and Ohio to spend more than $1 billion each to reduce emissions. Before she left office Ms. Browner reached another billion-dollar settlement with a Florida utility, and she and Mrs. Whitman have won agreement from dozens of oil refineries to spend hundreds of millions to reduce illegal pollutants.</p>
        <p>Some of these legal actions have now been halted by the order to review the underlying regulations, whose own future is also in doubt. All Mrs. Whitman has to do is remain true to her principles. As governor of New Jersey she signed on to all of Mr. Spitzer's lawsuits and joined Gov. George Pataki of New York and other Northeastern officials in a broad campaign to crack down on polluters in this region and elsewhere. That is exactly the kind of resolve she needs to summon now.</p>
