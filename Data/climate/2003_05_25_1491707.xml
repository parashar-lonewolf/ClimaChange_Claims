        <p>At first glance, the ''revised annual report'' from Exxon Mobil looks the part. Its glossy pages, bar graphs and photographs of smiling executives are what you'd expect to find. But it doesn't take long to see the ruse.</p>
        <p>Photographs of company facilities include protesters; the charts track the rise of oil consumption and global warming, and there are no actual numbers in the report. Oh, yes, and the globes on the cover are on fire.</p>

        <p>At first glance, the ''revised annual report'' from Exxon Mobil looks the part. Its glossy pages, bar graphs and photographs of smiling executives are what you'd expect to find. But it doesn't take long to see the ruse.</p>
        <p>Photographs of company facilities include protesters; the charts track the rise of oil consumption and global warming, and there are no actual numbers in the report. Oh, yes, and the globes on the cover are on fire.</p>
        <p>As the back page notes, it's satire from Greenpeace, the environmental group that has conducted a campaign against Exxon Mobil and its European subsidiary, Esso, for two years. A Greenpeace campaign coordinator, Gary Cook, said the report was sent to 500 Exxon Mobil employees, shareholders and oil industry analysts in advance of Exxon Mobil's annual meeting on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, any humor was lost on Exxon Mobil, whose chief executive, Lee R. Raymond, is among those skewered in the fake report.</p>
        <p>''I wish they would stop trying to be cute,'' said a company spokesman, Tom Cirigliano. He said Exxon Mobil is considering suing Greenpeace for ''fraudulent use'' of the company's logo.</p>
