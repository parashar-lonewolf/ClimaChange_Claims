        <p>When the Government asked who put the bubbles in Perrier, Mother Nature said, ''Not me.'' Until incidents of contamination forced Source Perrier to take its water off the market in February - traces of the toxic chemical benzene were found in some bottles - its claim that its water was ''naturally sparkling'' went unchallenged. But as the company prepared to reintroduce Perrier to America, the mineral water police at the Food and Drug Administration raised questions about its labeling. It seems that the carbon dioxide and the water come from the ground separately and are then combined. Thus, said an F.D.A. official, ''It is not a natually sparkling water.'' Perrier initially resisted the F.D.A. order to change its label, but relented last week. A company spokesman explained: ''We didn't agree, but we decided to make the change because we wanted to be responsible to the Government and to consumers.'' And maybe, just maybe, to keep selling that Perrier.</p>
