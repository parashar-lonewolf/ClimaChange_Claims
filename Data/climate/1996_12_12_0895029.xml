        <p>ON first impression, Joseph E. Stiglitz seems to fit the part of distracted ivory tower genius better than Washington mover and shaker.</p>
        <p>But the scraggly beard, disarming grin and slept-in-his-clothes look camouflage a tough, practical thinker. Mr. Stiglitz -- who resigned yesterday as chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers to become chief economist of the World Bank -- picked his battles and won most of them. More important, he helped to fashion a coherent, centrist economic policy as backbone to the President's aimless New Democrat rhetoric.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stiglitz, by the way, was indeed a distracted ivory tower genius. With three decades of acclaimed research to his credit and professorships at Oxford, Princeton and Stanford, he is viewed by many as the economic theorist of his generation and a shoo-in for a Nobel Prize.</p>
        <p>The surprise is that Mr. Stiglitz made the transition to the corridors of power with such grace. Originally hired in 1993 to add some academic patina to the council, he became chairman at an inauspicious moment when the future of his office itself was at stake. ''I took over in the spring of 1995, just when the House Republicans were threatening to zero out our budget,'' he recalled.</p>
        <p>His defense alone was not what saved the day.  After all, the Republicans' attempt to micromanage the White House's own budget was an early sign of the hubris that played into the President's strengths as a politician. But that does not undermine the case that Mr. Stiglitz made: that the council provides a valuable perspective because it draws on ''citizen bureaucrats'' who do not plan to make a career in Government. Council economists serve for only a few years, he reminded the Republicans, and academics were hardly inclined to partisan stands that would embarrass them after they returned to the faculty club.</p>
        <p>The council does not have the influence it did in the 1960's, when economists were hailed as scientists hot on the trail of a cure for unemployment. The profession has never recovered from the stagflation of the late 1970's, not to mention the barely concealed contempt of the assorted supply-siders who roamed the Reagan White House.</p>
        <p>But under Michael J. Boskin in the Bush Administration, the council did establish itself as a reality check on the flakier initiatives of the executive line agencies, a role that also suited his successor, Laura D'Andrea Tyson. And though he doesn't take credit, Mr. Stiglitz continued the tradition. For example, he fought a lonely (and thus far successful) battle to stop the privatization of the Government's two nuclear fuel plants under terms that would undermine efforts to safely liquidate Russia's bomb-grade uranium.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stiglitz, though, is happy to share the credit for the application of economic incentives to Government regulation. Take the case of rent vouchers, now Washington's only serious effort to improve housing. Mr. Stiglitz pointed out that waiting lists confined to single cities undermined incentives of the poor to look for work elsewhere. Allowing someone to move without losing his place in line for subsidized housing may seem a small, even obvious, reform. But from such acorns does better government grow.</p>
        <p>Other council initiatives have been more substantial. Thanks in part to Mr. Stiglitz, Washington is now pressing for a cost-effective attack on global warming. The approach, a nation-to-nation market in ''tradable emission permits,'' would create incentives to do the job as cheaply as possible -- say, by paying the Chinese to convert their coal-fired power plants to natural gas rather than spending even more money building mass transit in America no one wants to use.</p>
        <p>By the same token, the Administration has come down on the side of the economist-angels on a variety of other issues. These include incentives to avoid expensive construction in hurricane-  and earthquake-prone areas, incentives to rotate crops to avoid erosion and reforms that apply cost-benefit tests to toxic waste cleanups.</p>
        <p>The World Bank, which is only a couple of blocks away from the Executive Office Building, where he occupied a large corner office, may seem an odd fit for Mr. Stiglitz, whose self-appointed task at the White House was fine-tuning regulation. In fact, the 53-year-old economist asserts that his passion for efficient government makes him the right man for the job at the right time.</p>
        <p>The World Bank is in a deep funk, no longer able to justify its half-century-old role as a source of capital for poor countries now that private markets are providing substantial resources for growth. But unlike more conservative economists, Mr. Stiglitz argues that the bank should be redirected, not consigned to the scrap heap of history.</p>
        <p>What might this new mission be? As a clearing house for research on what works in developing countries and what doesn't, he suggests, with the specialized lending functions aimed at transforming the losers into winners. Stay tuned for details.</p>
