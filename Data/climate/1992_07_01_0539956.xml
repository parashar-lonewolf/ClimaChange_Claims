        <p>Deee-Lite's Politics</p>
        <p>When Deee-Lite released its first album, "World Clique" (Elektra), in 1990, it pretty much shook things up. The three band members managed to take club music, previously in the realm of the initiated underground, into pop music, mixing the glossy dance beats with tunes that even had melodies. And they were funny, with a kitsch sensibility that gloried in excess.</p>
        <p>The group's new record, "Infinity Within" (Elektra), gets roughly the same mix going, except that it adds what most second records recently seem to add: politics, and it goes easy on the melodies. But its mix of dance music and pop is still there, as is the attention to kitsch and fashion; the striking cover draws on U.F.O.'s, 1960's spy movies and Hollywood movie conventions. Although the group helped to design it, Lady Kier Kirby, its lead singer, who used to call herself Lady Miss Kier, doesn't want to talk about the cover. She's interested in talking about the music.</p>

        <p>Deee-Lite's Politics</p>
        <p>When Deee-Lite released its first album, "World Clique" (Elektra), in 1990, it pretty much shook things up. The three band members managed to take club music, previously in the realm of the initiated underground, into pop music, mixing the glossy dance beats with tunes that even had melodies. And they were funny, with a kitsch sensibility that gloried in excess.</p>
        <p>The group's new record, "Infinity Within" (Elektra), gets roughly the same mix going, except that it adds what most second records recently seem to add: politics, and it goes easy on the melodies. But its mix of dance music and pop is still there, as is the attention to kitsch and fashion; the striking cover draws on U.F.O.'s, 1960's spy movies and Hollywood movie conventions. Although the group helped to design it, Lady Kier Kirby, its lead singer, who used to call herself Lady Miss Kier, doesn't want to talk about the cover. She's interested in talking about the music.</p>
        <p>"The package speaks for itself, like our clothes," she said in a telephone interview in Manhattan. "The music is more important. The rest is just the icing on the cake. And I don't like to just eat icing."</p>
        <p>The themes move from environmental destruction to the failure of the judicial system to the need to vote. One song is called "I Had a Dream I Was Falling Through a Hole in the Ozone Layer." The band hasn't lost its sense of humor.</p>
        <p>"We're breaking stereotypes," she said. "We're mixing dance music with mind music. And we're very specific in terms of our politics. We feel a responsibility to point out our fears of environmental destruction. I'd be hypocritical not writing songs about what we think. And anyway, this music, it's not really pop music. If we were trying to write pop music, we wouldn't be writing about politics."</p>
        <p>The band had originally tried to get "World Clique" released in an Eco-Pak, the environmentally more sympathetic form of CD packaging, which is made from recycled paperboard and plastic. She said the record company refused. But it relented this time, she said.</p>
        <p>"The first time they said no," she said. "The second time they said no, at first. We asked them to read the lyrics on the record, and they figured that maybe we had a point. Really, it's not the record company: it's the record stores that complain. There's a lot of politics involved." A Child, a Man, a Father</p>
        <p>The rap group Pete Rock and C. L. Smooth has just released "Mecca and the Soul Brother" (Elektra), which is flying out the doors of record stores on the strength of its first single, "They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y)."</p>
        <p>The song, which rides on a soul-jazz rhythm track, deals with C. L. Smooth having grown up as a child of a single mother. C. L. Smooth, whose real name is Corey Penn, wrote the tune, in which he discusses his family, the grandparents and uncles and aunts who raised him.</p>
        <p>"I was listening to a lot of rap groups, and they were talking about things that weren't real," he said about why he wrote the song. "It wasn't what black people were about. I have a son, and if he looked up to the rappers in the 1990's, he'd be in trouble: the topics aren't right for a young man to look up to. So I wrote a short bio of my life: who had an influence on me, who were the important figures in my life.</p>
        <p>"My real grandfather, my real parents, aunts and uncles: these people meant something to me; these are my role models. Not Michael Jordan or Danny Glover. The importance is the realism of the rap. You get a lot of attention; you can feel invincible if your family is truly behind you." No, We're Not Copying</p>
        <p>Little known at the time, the New York-based group Helmet made news this year when it was signed to a lucrative recording contract by Interscope, a West Coast label. Inter scope was obviously hoping to duplicate the success of Nirvana, an alternative rock band, which had just vaulted from obscurity to the big time with its hit album, "Nevermind."</p>
        <p>Helmet's new record, "Meantime," has just been released, and it has almost nothing to do with Nirvana. Where Nirvana had songs, Helmet has riffs; where Nirvana's lead singer, Kurt Cobain, can sing melodies, Page Hamilton, Helmet's lead singer, howls and croaks.</p>
        <p>The music is hard and driving, with riffs that remind a listener of early 1970's hard rock. It's also self-conscious, a form of art rock with populist pretensions that befits Mr. Hamilton's background. As a jazz-theory student, he worked with the experimental composer Glenn Branca, then moved into the experimental downtown band Band of Susans.</p>
        <p>"I listen to all sorts of stuff," Mr. Hamilton said. "The music in the band doesn't sound like Bartok and Coltrane, but there's a sense of pretty intense passion and commitment to our music that you hear in Coltrane, say. With every show we play, you get a sense that we're giving it everything we've got. And my approach to soloing is influenced by Coltrane, no question. I will never have his ability, but the way I group notes in groups of five or seven or three that don't fit in bar lines is definitely his, and the distortion and feedback come from his sheets of sound that's there, too."</p>
        <p>Given Mr. Hamilton's background, the record is conventional in many ways. Though it's not a pure hard-rock record, it's not an experimental hard-rock record, either.</p>
        <p>"The least conventional aspects are the guitar solos, where I jump in, and ruin all the tightness that was so hard to achieve," he said. "I grew up loving Led Zeppelin and Aerosmith: that's straight-ahead rock stuff. I could have made it much more arty, made it a lot denser and dissonant, but that strikes me as contrived. I just go by what I hear. It just feels good. It's conventional, but we're not exactly Guns 'n' Roses."</p>
