        <p>AN experiment involving alfalfa seedlings indicates that plant genes are less vulnerable than had been thought to damage from the increased solar radiation resulting from the depletion of the earth's protective ozone layer, scientists at Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island have reported.</p>
        <p>But other experts said that plants vary widely in their response to the harmful ultraviolet rays and cautioned that it would be unwise to make generalizations on the basis of an experiment involving one species. They also raised a number of other caveats.</p>
        <p>The experiment was reported this month in the British journal Nature by Dr. Florence Elsie Quaite, a botanist; Dr. Betsy M. Sutherland, a molecular biologist, and Dr. John C. Sutherland, a biophysicist. Dr. Quaite has left the Brookhaven lab since the experiment was concluded.</p>
        <p>Scientists know that some of the sun's ultraviolet, or UV, radiation can damage plant and animal tissue in a variety of ways. UV radiation at the relatively short frequencies of 280 to 315 nanometers, called UV-B, is blocked by the earth's stratospheric ozone layer. Experts fear that the depletion of the ozone layer by synthetic chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons will allow more UV-B to reach the earth, damaging plants and causing the incidence of skin cancer and eye cataracts to rise.</p>
        <p>In the past, Dr. Betsy Sutherland said, researchers have not measured the biological effects on plants of UV radiation with wavelengths longer than about 315 nanometers, which are not blocked by the ozone layer. The Brookhaven scientists did so, exposing the alfalfa seedlings to radiation at both the shorter wavelengths and at wavelengths up to 405 nanometers.</p>
        <p>They found that the plants' DNA was damaged by wavelengths up to 365 nanometers. The scientists concluded that alfalfa DNA already received a damaging dose of UV radiation in nature because the higher wavelengths are not blocked by ozone. Small Increase in Damage</p>
        <p>They concluded further that any additional DNA damage suffered as a result of ozone depletion would amount to "a small increase in a factor that is already small," Dr. Betsy Sutherland said.</p>
        <p>Dr. John Sutherland said: "We believe that a very large fraction of the damage done by both the long-range and short-wave radiation is in fact repaired. The degree to which that will continue to be true as ozone is depleted depends on how far ozone depletion goes and how good the repair mechanisms are." He said the team planned to pursue the question.</p>
        <p>Until now, scientists have believed that some plants are more susceptible than humans and other animals to ultraviolet damage. "We have now found on the basis of this work that this is not the case," Dr. John Sutherland said. In the Nature paper, the researchers wrote that their results "indicate that plants are not among the most sensitive biological targets" of UV radiation.</p>
        <p>Other recent research has also found that the shorter-wave radiation allowed to reach the earth because of ozone depletion would amount to only a small part of the harmful UV radiation already being absorbed by phytoplankton, the tiny marine plants that form the basis of the oceanic ecosystem. Those findings are consistent with the new results, the Brookhaven researchers wrote.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, they wrote, "plants are certainly at risk from ultraviolet radiation resulting from destruction of stratospheric ozone." The Brookhaven findings provide no justification for a lessening of efforts to stop ozone depletion, Dr. John Sutherland said.</p>
        <p>Other experts agreed that there was no reason to abandon concern. They characterized the Brookhaven experiment as sound and valuable as far as it went, but they questioned whether broad conclusions could be drawn from it.</p>
        <p>"We know from other experiments that plant responses to UV radiation vary widely from species to species," said Dr. Alan Teramura, a botanist at the University of Maryland. "What is unknown here is whether this particular plant was a very sensitive or resistant one."</p>
        <p>Moreover, Dr. Teramura said, most DNA damage appears to take place when a plant is actively growing and performing photosynthesis.  A week-old seedling, like those used in the experiment, is not yet actually growing on its own, he said.</p>
        <p>Another expert, Dr. Martyn Caldwell of Utah State University, said that as far as he knew, it had never been demonstrated that the type of DNA damage shown in the experiment resulted in damage to the plants in nature. The other effects of ultraviolet radiation, such as the inhibition of photosynthesis, are more important, he said.</p>
