        <p>Before many more years go by, China is likely to surpass the United States as the world's biggest economy. It already is the fastest-growing economy, one of the consequences of a new Chinese revolution. Sheryl WuDunn and Nicholas D. Kristof watched that revolution from the inside as The Times's correspondents in Beijing from 1988 to 1993 and won a Pulitzer Prize for journalism in 1990.</p>
        <p>In a new book, "China Wakes" (Times Books), they describe a society that is at once politically repressive and economically freewheeling. The regime still allows a prisoner to be asphyxiated by the fumes from his own uncollected excrement, turns the family members of imprisoned human rights campaigners out on the streets, forces young women to undergo sterilization and abortion. At the same time, the Government is overseeing a breathtaking transformation of individual lives and institutions that is rapidly making China richer than ever before. The following excerpts, written like their book in alternate chapters by the two authors, portray today's moneymaking frenzy -- and China's future as a global economic giant.</p>
        <p>THE STATE SecurIty Ministry secretly runs a dry-cleaning establishment that caters to foreigners in Beijing. Initially I was suspicious, thinking that this was a way to plant bugs in the suits of foreign diplomats and journalists. My Chinese friends laughed at my suspicions.</p>
        <p>"Of course not," one said. "State Security just wants to make money."</p>
        <p>For the same reason, State Security also ran a bakery, and the national police went into hotel management. The Army General Staff Department became part owner of one of China's best hotels, the Palace. For a time, a local army unit ran a travel service that operated a brothel. The army also runs scores of factories that make televisions, refrigerators, clocks and other products. The Public Security Ministry runs a fascinating pair of shops selling night sticks and electric cattle prods.</p>
        <p>What happened is that Government offices felt that they had been left out of the money game. So they decided to go into business, often taking advantage of extra land, well-placed contacts or special skills. Even schools began to run their own factories or farm yards to raise extra money for chairs and textbooks and teacher salaries.</p>
        <p>There's a downside to all this, of course. Many school principals seem to devote more energy to their sideline businesses than to the curriculum. And when a liquor bureau runs a bar on the side, rival taverns may have reason to complain about the fairness of the regulations. Yet there's also a benefit: These companies give the bureaucrats a stake in the market economy. Officials at every level now depend for their personal incomes and benefits on the progress of the reforms and the economic system. Only a thriving market can satisfy their hunger.</p>
        <p>Everyone in China, it seems, has gone into business or is moonlighting: waitressing at night, writing articles for popular magazines, teaching English or aerobics, consulting on computer programs or giving seminars on stocks and bonds. If they don't already have an evening job, Chinese intellectuals and officials are taking night classes to train for a second career. This way, they are able to triple or quadruple their salaries and, at the same time, keep their "iron rice bowl" -- with its job security, housing and health insurance.</p>
        <p>China today is something of a cross between Dodge City and Dickensian England. It's a lawless place motivated by a strange mix of greed and apprehension that this wonderful money-making opportunity could end at any moment. China may not use little boys as chimney sweeps, but the textile and garment industries work children 14 hours a day, seven days a week, and often they sleep by their looms. If you lose your arm in the loom, you're fired. That may sound grim, but 19th-century capitalism is a big improvement over 18th-century feudalism.</p>
        <p>Some people say China is not really moving toward Western-style capitalism because the capital still belongs to state-owned banks that assign it for noneconomic reasons. In other words, the price of capital in China isn't interest. It's a bribe. Or it's the work that has gone into cultivating guanxi, or connections, with the bankers and local officials. They are right, to some degree, but then again 19th-century capitalism didn't operate exactly by the book, either. Some of the vast fortunes were collected through monopolies, which in turn were frequently awarded because of bribes or connections in Washington or the state capitals.</p>
        <p>The same kind of manipulation of economics and politics is happening today in China, and there is a strong sense throughout the country that now is the time in which the great financial empires will be made, before the system becomes more rigid and the opportunities fewer.</p>
        <p>The analogy with the industrializing United States is also a reminder that a country can endure enormous shocks and turbulence at the same time it is enjoying economic growth. In the 19th century, Americans saw appalling inequity, gross manipulations of the political system, lynchings, bank collapses, brutal repression of labor and leftist activism.</p>
        <p>A visitor to the United States in the 19th century might easily have been overwhelmed by the injustice and disorder. He could have interviewed penniless immigrants in the crime-plagued slums of Boss Tweed's New York, chatted with dispossessed farmers in the Great Plains during one of the several depressions, toured the cotton plantations of the South and the manufacturing cities of the Northeast and listened to the rage. And he could well have concluded that the center would never hold, that America would be swept by war and revolution. Instead, the history of the United States underscores how much abuse a country can absorb when it is growing economically.</p>
        <p>China now enjoys that kind of economic growth, and perhaps it too will demonstrate this kind of resiliency. There is, however, one big difference. The United States had established a civil society and enjoyed a far more flexible political system, one that could respond to popular pressure without exploding. A free press had always flourished, and elections were regularly held everywhere, even if they were sometimes rigged. However inadequate the political and legal system was in the 19th century, it was far more responsive than China's is today. In China, the question remains: Will this era's emperors allow their system to evolve in similar ways?</p>
        <p>AH CHANG IS A MAN IN his early 30's, 5 foot 2, with thinning hair, a wrinkling smile and a thickening waistline. Nick and I met him through friends, and I looked him up whenever I visited his hometown of Guangzhou (Canton). Each time I dropped by, he was engaged in a different line of business. Each time he was richer.</p>
        <p>Ah Chang, a nickname used by his Cantonese friends, never went to college. After he finished high school, he spent a year sawing boards and soldering wires in an electronics shop. From there, he was transferred to a job stoking a coal-burning furnace, where he shoveled coal all day long, breathing the moist dust each time he inhaled. When he came home, his hair and face clouded by a veil of black soot, his mother would look at him and cry.</p>
        <p>He made his first fortune in the late 1980's as a restaurant owner. But he worried that the environment might change after Deng Xiaoping's death, and so he was looking for a way to move abroad. Then the 1989 Tiananmen movement gave him a chance. He was simply one of the millions of passive supporters of the Tiananmen movement, and he was in no danger of being arrested. Nevertheless, he had heard through the grapevine that America was giving political asylum to anyone who claimed involvement in the movement.</p>
        <p>He sold his business and bought a false American passport for $20,000. The passport was a good forgery, but even so Ah Chang was worried about being caught. Instead of flying directly to the United States, he flew throughout Asia, stopping in Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo, where he stayed a few days before he made his way to San Francisco. Once he arrived in California, he thought he had made it. He destroyed his passport, because he was afraid of being caught with a forgery, and turned himself into the immigration authorities. He claimed political asylum.</p>
        <p>The Immigration Service detained him for several months and then determined that he was not a genuine political refugee. It returned him to China. Once there, Ah Chang bribed and ingratiated his way out of trouble, but his money was gone -- he had spent $30,000 on his passport, air tickets, bribes and other costs -- and he had no business.</p>
        <p>He started again from scratch, opening a small restaurant and bar in Guangdong, paying off the authorities so that he could run a cable from a satellite dish on a nearby roof. That enabled him to show Hong Kong television in his bar, and business improved. Even so, he wasn't making as much money as he wanted. His big break came when a major foreign developer wanted to buy out his restaurant and demolish it as part of a large construction project. The foreigners handed over $40,000 to Ah Chang.</p>
        <p>"It wasn't a very good restaurant," he told me over dinner one evening. "I didn't manage it very well. I had all my friends over and they ate cheaply. But I had a good location. In a flash, I had $40,000."</p>
        <p>Ah Chang took the money and bought a large apartment, which he furnished lavishly. His total assets were now about $70,000. He hardly cared about politics but he did like his freedom and he did want to travel. He had hooked up with a Hong Kong Da Laoban, or Big Boss, and was helping him hunt for property deals. He had also begun trading in shoes, contracting with factories and selling the shoes in other cities in China. He had his eye on a car and he had plunked down nearly $45,000 to buy a lakeside summer home.</p>
        <p>Ah Chang was always devising ways of making money, like selling medicines. He happened to befriend the factory manager of a large pharmaceutical manufacturer, and the manager agreed to supply him with one of the latest kinds of intravenous solutions.</p>
        <p>"I've known the guy for an entire year," Ah Chang explained. "He calls me practically every day and I accompany him wherever he wants to go. I eat meals with him and run around and have fun with him. So he trusts me and I trust him. Then I took the purchaser at a hospital out to lunch, and he says he'll buy the medicine from me. I'll slip a little to him on the side."</p>
        <p>"How much will you give him?" I asked.</p>
        <p>"I'll give him 50 percent."</p>
        <p>"How much will you give the factory manager?" I asked.</p>
        <p>"I'll give him about 20 percent."</p>
        <p>"But then all you have left is 30 percent," I said.</p>
        <p>"But 30 percent isn't so bad. If I get 30 percent here, 30 percent there and 30 percent somewhere else, that's not so bad. There's really no other way. I have to give them a cut to make them happy. At least I make something. After all, the law doesn't allow individuals to trade in medicine, so I need a way to hook up with someone who has a license."</p>
        <p>Ah Chang's newest moneymaking scheme is smuggling dogs into China. He is bringing in dogs as pets, not as food, which is how Cantonese traditionally viewed dogs. "In fact, this is good for society," he said. Chinese should stop looking at dogs as dishes and should start looking at them as companions, he added. There was a great demand for pets, but there was a rule against importing dogs: you simply couldn't bring them in for sale.</p>
        <p>"Everyone smuggles, and I'm just a pea in the business," Ah Chang explained. "It may be against the law, but the law is ridiculous. You see, I'm not cheating anyone, really. I'm cheating the Government, but that's nothing. The Government has cheated the ordinary people for years, and it still cheats us because it doesn't let us import many things. Anyhow, I'm not smuggling drugs."</p>
        <p>I was always curious how these smugglers operated. Were they the Chinese mafia? Were they an organized network of people who carried cellular phones and wore black suits? Ah Chang explained that a friend had introduced him to a maritime smuggler, a man who lives in a large multistoried brick house with lots of privacy. Most farmers use their land to grow rice or dig fish ponds. This man, an uneducated peasant who knew the sea but couldn't even write his name, had converted his plot of land into a nice lawn. His entire family had quit farming to work in the family smuggling business. No big networks. This guy fended for himself. His family owned two big boats that they kept hidden by the coast. Even Ah Chang didn't dare ask where the boats were.</p>
        <p>"How does he actually smuggle the stuff into China?" I asked.</p>
        <p>"I tell him what I want, where to get it, who to pick it up from in Hong Kong," Ah Chang said. "Then I give him a deposit, and when he brings the merchandise to me, I pay him the rest."</p>
        <p>The whole family invited Ah Chang over to the house and then treated him to a fancy meal at a dimly lit restaurant with beautiful, and available, women.</p>
        <p>"Each time we go out, he pays several thousand yuan," or hundreds of dollars, Ah Chang said. "He needs to find customers, too. Is this the underground mafia? Hmph! I don't know what this mafia is that everyone refers to. You call my small-time peasant fisherman the mafia? I don't think so. He just wants to make some money. Would you say I'm dealing with the mafia? I don't think so. What's the mafia, then? Maybe it's the people who smuggle heroin, maybe it's the pimps and prostitutes, the weapons dealers. Maybe that's it. In America, you know what's illegal. Your laws are clear. Not in China. In fact, in China, the police, they're the worst of them all. They're linked to the smugglers, too. China is a crazy country now."</p>
        <p>ORGANIZED CRIME SEEMED, IN part, organized by the state. Everyone knew that the police and the customs officials were involved in smuggling and other illicit practices. There was Fangcheng, for instance.</p>
        <p>Fangcheng, a small port in Guangxi Province, suddenly became one of the most popular harbors in China. The reason was that the local customs officials were involved in small sideline broker companies that offered to handle all the paper work for importing goods. These broker companies set up offices along a street near the port, and the importer simply handed shipping documents to the company, which then filled out all the customs forms, obtained the import licenses and ushered the goods through customs. For this the officials took a fat commission, but the buyer didn't feel the pinch. The customs officers never assessed the true substantial duties on goods handled by the sideline companies, so importers saved large sums on duties and the brokers could then skim some for themselves.</p>
        <p>The central Government realized that something was up when cargoes destined for all parts of China lined up to use this one small port in Guangxi. There were huge delays for ships to get into the port, and hardly any duty was being paid. So the authorities investigated and temporarily closed the port in mid-1993.</p>
        <p>The Government has had occasional successes like Fangcheng, but on a broader scale it is unable to come to grips with the country's rampant corruption. Rather, money and resources have gone into feeding the national obsession -- the expansion of the economy. And this frenetic growth may be brokering a true revolution in China.</p>
        <p>WHEN THE historians of the world gather 100 years from now, they may well conclude that the dominant trend of our age was the rise of China.</p>
        <p>From the vantage point of someone with a long view, the ascendancy of the West is a recent phenomenon -- dating from about 500 years ago. For much of history Chinese philosophy, poetry, science and government were more sophisticated than those of Europe, and China's standard of living may have been higher. If China can raise its standard of living and education, if it can squeeze out of its present ideological straitjacket, then -- who knows what it may have in store for the world?</p>
        <p>China's economic revolution is more significant than the Maoist revolution of the 1940's and 50's, and the best way to appreciate its magnitude is to squat in the fields in rural villages, chatting with peasants. The World Bank calculates that since the reform era began in 1978 a total of 170 million Chinese have risen from absolute poverty. That marks a 60 percent decline in the number of the destitute in China -- impressive by any standard. In the Philippines, the number of absolutely poor people in 1990, 13 million, is the same as in 1970.</p>
        <p>Xing Yisheng's life offers a window into the scope of the change for the poorest Chinese. I met him in a mud-brick village on the edge of the Gobi Desert in northwestern Gansu Province. Xing, 74, was wearing a much-patched and faded Mao suit. He was hobbling down a rutted dirt path, and he invited me into his shack a few doors away.</p>
        <p>The shack had two rooms, each dominated by a kang, a platform bed with a fireplace underneath. The dirt floor was swept clean and the furniture consisted of three rickety wooden chairs set around a crude wooden table. The mud walls were papered with newspapers, with pictures from old calendars providing a bit of color. Xing grandly commanded a daughter-in-law to bring tea, which she carefully poured into a couple of cracked cups.</p>
        <p>"Before Liberation," he recalled, referring to the Communist takeover in 1949, "I was just a farmhand, working for the landlords, because I didn't have any land. I had two sons then, but I had to sell them because I didn't have any money. I was ill with typhoid. So I sold my two boys for 400 pounds of rice each. I never saw them again.</p>
        <p>"There's a huge difference between life now and the way it was then," Xing added. A grown son -- one of four children born after 1949 -- sat quietly a few feet away, looking bored, as if he had heard it all before. "Our life today is better than a landlord's life in the past. But I tell this to young people and they don't want to hear. They say, Go away! They don't know about the old life."</p>
        <p>Xing pointed reproachfully at his son, who appeared to be in his late 30's. "Young man," Xing declared, his voice rising, "now you're living in heaven! You dress well, you eat well." Xing turned back to me and waved dismissively at his son. "Why, last year this young man wanted to buy a stereo cassette recorder for 700 yuan  [ about $80 at the unofficial exchange rate ] . I said: 'No, that's too much. We should buy a mule.' A mule can work. It's useful. A stereo isn't. And a mule is so big, while a stereo is so small."</p>
        <p>It was clear who had won the argument. A nice stereo occupied the place of honor in the middle of the room. Despite Xing's misgivings, the family was doing more than subsist; it was beginning to enjoy a bit of leisure. A similar change is unfolding in most of the million-odd villages in China.</p>
        <p>SINCE DENG XIAOPING took over in 1978, the Chinese economy has enjoyed an annual average growth rate of a bit more than 9 percent. That is triple the average growth rate of the United States in that period, and about 70 percent more than the growth rate in India or Indonesia.</p>
        <p>China is now the biggest producer in the world of coal, cement, grain, cotton, meat and fish. It ranks third in steel production, after Japan and the United States and fifth in crude oil output, after the United States, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Iran.</p>
        <p>To get a sense of the giddy pace of change in China, just consider the process of industrialization around the world. Britain was the first country to enjoy an industrial revolution, beginning in the late 18th century, and it then took 58 years for per capita British gross domestic product to double. The American industrial revolution was a bit faster, with per capita output doubling in 47 years from 1839. Beginning in 1885, Japan doubled its per capita gross domestic product in 34 years.</p>
        <p>Now, in the late 20th century, China is roaring along with its own industrial revolution, doubling its per capita output every 10 years. The "Four Dragons" -- Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea -- managed similar growth rates, or even slightly higher ones, in peak periods of their development, but together they are no more than the size of a Chinese province. For such growth rates in such a huge country as China, there's been nothing like it in history.</p>
        <p>Last year, the World Bank published a major study on East Asia, concluding that there was only one chance in 10,000 that so many economic miracles would be located so close to one another. There are some important common threads among the region's success stories, and they may shed some light on China's prospects.</p>
        <p>Like its neighbors, China began its reform program with an effort to boost agricultural incentives. Japan, Taiwan and South Korea also underwent a land redistribution in the aftermath of World War II, and the relative equality seems to have been a factor in their growth. Again, like its neighbors, China has opened itself up to foreign investment and management, and its export drive in the coastal provinces has forced it to compete with other manufacturers around the world.</p>
        <p>The high saving rate in today's East Asia is particularly striking. China has a personal saving rate that ranges between 35 and 40 percent, compared with about 5 percent in the United States. These savings generate the capital for new factories, roads and shops that, in turn, boost economic growth.</p>
        <p>The other kind of capital necessary for sustained growth is human capital -- a healthy, educated work force that can run assembly lines and figure out how to do things better and faster. The Communists have done well in primary education, and nearly all children get at least a few years of elementary school. Perhaps 95 percent of all children start school and more than 80 percent graduate from elementary school. Because of the Communist Party's traditional suspicion of intellectuals, China has a low university enrollment, only 1.7 percent. But even there China manages to focus its training on the specialties it needs; every year it manages to graduate more than 200,000 engineers, nearly twice as many as the United States.</p>
        <p>Literacy is still low, but it is much higher than ever before. Wang Chigang, a 76-year-old peasant in central Anhui Province, typifies the country's many illiterates. He grew up as a landless peasant and beggar, never went to school and still cannot write his name. "I don't like the city," he said, sipping a cup of dark tea in his shack. "Too crowded. Nobody has time for you. And it's embarrassing when I have to go to the toilet -- I don't know which is which. Since I don't know the characters for 'man' and 'woman,' I have to ask for help finding the right one." Yet Wang's children and his grandchildren have all gone to school. Pointing to a grandson who finished high school, Wang boasted, "He can write really well."</p>
        <p>While some local governments ignore the illiteracy problem, others are actively campaigning to teach people to read and write. In the villages of Xiping County in Henan Province in central China, students stop visitors and ask them to read a few characters on a blackboard. Any visitor who cannot read the characters is not allowed to enter the village. This means that illiterates are effectively grounded, and in frustration many have joined the special reading classes offered in each village. Now in Xiping County, according to local officials, only 1.7 percent of those between the ages of 20 and 40 are illiterate.</p>
        <p>The other crucial kind of human capital in which the Communists have invested is public health care. The Chinese medical system is in many ways a model for developing countries. While China spends less than 4 percent of gross national product on medical care (compared with 15 percent in the United States), its health statistics are comparable to those of much richer nations. And in the cities, health statistics are as good as those of American urban areas. In Shanghai, for example, the most recent figure shows that 9.9 out of every 1,000 infants die in their first year of life.  In New York City the infant mortality rate is 10.2 per 1,000. A baby in Shanghai can expect to live 76 years, while average life expectancy in New York is 73.8 years.</p>
        <p>To get a better sense of how Chinese doctors achieve such health statistics, I spent a day with the perpetually sorrowful Dr. Su Ke in the villages of Xishuangbanna District, a tropical region near Vietnam. A 46-year-old with a graying crew cut, Dr. Su works out of a rural clinic but regularly hikes with the other doctors into the mountains to see the peasants who don't believe in doctors. As we drove into the mountains in my hired car, he explained the difficulties.</p>
        <p>"When we go out and try to inoculate babies, some of the peasants are very frightened and hide their kids," Dr. Su said. "Or they turn their dogs on us to bite us and drive us away." Even if Dr. Su manages to get his needle into the derriere of a local child -- a task made easier because none of them wear pants -- he is likely to get in trouble. "We give them injections against measles, and then the kid gets a cold. So the parents come and complain. They say, 'You promised that my child wouldn't get sick!' "</p>
        <p>We stopped the car by a roadside one-room clinic operated by an 18-year-old peasant who had just opened up shop as a doctor. The peasant was trying to pull the abscessed tooth of a teen-age girl, but he wasn't making much headway. Blood was all over, and knives and pliers were scattered about, and both the doctor and the patient looked a bit discouraged. There was no Novocain, but the young woman was using some Chinese medicine that seemed to deaden the pain pretty well. Dr. Su took over the pair of pliers, rapped away with a chisel, and after about five minutes the tooth came out.</p>
        <p>Instead of allocating resources for dental offices or complex procedures like coronary operations or dialysis, China has channeled its money to basic care -- an approach that is far more cost-effective. For example, basic treatment for leukemia costs about $5,000 and on average adds a bit more than a month to a patient's life. The same $5,000, used to buy vitamin A supplements for children, adds a total of 10,000 years of life expectancy.</p>
        <p>WHAT DO THESE improvements in health, education and living standards add up to? For all the brutality of the Chinese regime, it is presiding over an economic revolution that is scarcely fathomable. Never before in human history have so many people -- or even such a large share of humanity -- risen from poverty so rapidly.</p>
        <p>China's economic gains are mirrored in a broader phenomenon: the rise of a "Greater China" as an increasingly integrated economic entity. Greater China consists of China, Hong Kong and Taiwan; despite their political differences, their economies are being melded into one. Taiwanese companies have moved entire assembly lines across the Taiwan Strait into southern China. Most of the Taiwan shoemaking industry has relocated to Guangdong and Fujian Provinces; much of the garment and sportswear industries have moved as well. Once Taiwan allows direct flights across the strait, that air route from China to Taiwan may well become one of the busiest in the world, the Asian equivalent of the Boston-New York-Washington corridor.</p>
        <p>The global economy is sometimes said to be tripolar, revolving around the United States, Japan and the European Community. But Greater China is rapidly becoming a fourth pole, a new pillar of the international economy. According to World Bank projections using comparable international prices, Greater China in the year 2002 is projected to have a gross domestic product of $9.8 trillion, compared with $9.7 trillion in the same year for the United States. If those forecasts hold, Greater China would not just be another economic pole. It would be the biggest of them all.</p>
        <p>IT IS POSSIBLE THAT CHINA will fall apart during the succession struggles after the death of Deng Xiaoping. But, for all the risks, there is a strong chance China will succeed over the coming decades in sustaining an economic boom. If so, the ramifications would not only be economic; the global diplomatic, political and military balance may also have to be recalibrated.</p>
        <p>Continued economic growth also means that China will demand far more of the world's energy resources. It will add substantially to the world's problems with acid rain, chlorofluorocarbons and other environmental hazards. China may come to dominate a number of sports and sweep the medals chart in every Olympics. Already China has the largest army in the world and the most rapidly increasing military budget.</p>
        <p>Some would argue that China's Government cannot sustain its economic revolution because it is so despotic. But that is probably faulty thinking. In determining economic growth, repression may matter, but savings rates matter more. There is a historical parallel that underscores how one can harbor hopes for China while retaining an antipathy for the present leadership.</p>
        <p>The dynasty in Chinese history most like the present one is the Qin, founded in 221 B.C. by an emperor who was a brilliant military leader and a cruel tyrant. The Qin emperor burned books and buried scholars alive, but he also unified the country and linked border fortifications to create the Great Wall. Mao Zedong himself acknowledged (and was flattered by) the similarities in vision and ruthlessness between him and the Qin emperor.</p>
        <p>Partly because the Qin emperor was so harsh, his dynasty lasted just a few years after his death. Yet the Qin emperor laid a foundation that served China well. The next dynasty was the Han, which lasted more than four centuries and was a golden era -- a flourishing age for the arts and scholarship as well as for the economy.</p>
        <p>The Communist dynasty, like the Qin, may well have inadvertently laid a foundation for the next dynasty. The Communists' brutality and incompetence killed tens of millions of Chinese, and torture continues today in prisons around the country. But the party also united China, redistributed land and wealth, and destroyed the special interests that were stifling economic growth. China now has a chance to grow and prosper and become a major international power, perhaps eventually a superpower such as the world has never known.</p>
