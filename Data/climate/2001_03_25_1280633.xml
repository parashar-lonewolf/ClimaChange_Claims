        <p>PRESIDENT BUSH has declared that, once again, the nation has an acute shortage of energy. But the enemy his administration has identified is not one of the usual suspects: profligate usage, OPEC or Saddam Hussein. Instead, it is environmentalism.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Bush's energy team prepares a comprehensive energy strategy, its members are meeting with conservationists as well as oil industry lobbyists. But the team has begun outlining what sounds like a supply-side crusade under an anti-green flag.</p>
        <p>Among the measures under consideration, according to administration officials and some Congressional and industry experts, are: easing clean-air rules for coal-fired power plants; loosening federal standards on  river flows to protect fish; giving refiners relief from diverse anti-pollution standards in different states; allowing states to control drilling rights on some federal lands; pushing construction of nuclear plants; and, the  headline grabber so far, opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas  exploration.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has not been shy about taking on environmentalists: last week, he reversed a Clinton administration executive order that tightened arsenic standards for drinking water, a boon to the mining industry. And in a preview to his approach to energy policy, he dropped a campaign pledge to require power plants to control emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas.</p>
        <p>Spencer Abraham, the energy secretary, called the drafting of the energy plan a search for a middle ground between environmentalists and industry. But he sounded the new battle cry at a Washington energy conference last week, ridiculing a recent newspaper ad from a pro-conservation group, which argued California should solve its electricity shortages by a crash efficiency plan.</p>
        <p>He cited a study his department prepared that claims that the United States will need 1,300 new power plants during the next 20 years. It was the Clinton administration's folly, he said, to think that the nation could limit demand and just let supply take care of itself.</p>
        <p>''Through neglect or complacency or ideology, this approach has led us to the crisis we face today,'' he said.</p>
        <p>THE Bush arsenal includes pointing out that a proliferation of ''green tape'' has made blocking energy projects on environmental grounds too easy, and that it has cost the nation an adequate fuel supply. And the Bush team also  points the finger at people who use environmental rules to simply pursue their own narrow interests.</p>
        <p>''We've had an approach that isn't balanced because it's been so easy to stop projects,'' said  Vice President Dick Cheney, who is heading the energy team. ''Nobody wants to be able to  see a transmission line from their front yard. Nobody wants a gas pipeline through their community. Nobody wants a power plant in their county. It's going to be very important that we change the circumstances.''</p>
        <p>Part of the Bush focus comes out of politics. Environmental groups gave generously to Democrats, while Republicans collected $10 million of the $14 million in political contributions by oil and gas companies and their trade groups, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.</p>
        <p>There is also the question of experience. Mr. Bush, Mr. Cheney and Donald Evans, the commerce secretary, who is also a member of the energy team, are themselves oil industry veterans. They are very aware that the clean-air act of 1970, as amended in 1990, is the industry's bête noire. And there is no question that it has forced companies to reduce output from older power plants and refineries.</p>
        <p>Yet some of the measures under consideration have, at best, a tangential relationship to the electricity shortage in California. Mr. Bush's backing of legislation introduced by Senator Frank Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, to open a part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration will do nothing to increase the nation's capacity to produce electricity. Oil is not a major fuel for power plants.</p>
        <p>Natural gas shortages are a different  story. Because it is a clean-burning fuel, power generators have come to rely heavily on it to produce electricity. What seemed like an endless bounty of cheap gas a few years ago now seems more precarious. Prices have soared, and strains on gas pipelines are  obvious.</p>
        <p>But it's not clear that natural gas is in crisis. Natural gas has been so cheap for so long that companies have not had the incentive to fully exploit known reserves or invest in new infrastructure. High prices -- as opposed to government incentives -- could work to secure more supply relatively quickly, many experts argue. And while it is true that community groups have made it difficult to build gas pipelines, the mother of them all -- a $10 billion gas superhighway from Alaska's North Slope to the lower 48 states -- has been stalled for economic reasons, not environmental ones.</p>
        <p>WITH California experiencing rolling blackouts and other parts of the country, including New York, worried about shortages this summer, it seems sound enough to review environmental controls. But the administration also seems to be tailoring the problem to fit a narrow, deregulatory solution long favored by the industry.</p>
        <p>What Mr. Bush is calling an energy crisis --  scattered shortages of electricity generating capacity and last year's isolated gasoline price spikes -- is more complex than the label suggests. An anti-green approach, which focuses on how environmental controls have helped create the problem, may obscure how they could also be part of the solution.</p>
        <p>''I haven't heard a single word from them about energy efficiency,'' said Representative Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, a Democrat. ''Our nation's competitive advantage is technology, not oil reserves, so we ought be using that technology to make our society more efficient.''</p>
        <p>A recent study by five national laboratories under the Department of Energy found that market-based energy efficiency policies, like tax credits for fuel-efficient vehicles, could reduce the growth of energy demand by a third through 2010.</p>
        <p>David Nemtzow of the Alliance to Save Energy says that energy efficiency regulations Mr. Clinton promulgated at the end of his term, most notably new standards for air conditioners, could reduce projections for future energy needs by 50,000 megawatts through 2020. That's one-eighth of the total projected growth in demand during that period.</p>
        <p>Yet the president's budget framework envisions cutting funding for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs by 30 percent, Congressional experts who have been briefed on the planned cuts said. And in what seems like a bit of smash-mouth budgeting, the administration has even suggested linking funding for efficiency programs to royalties from Arctic drilling.</p>
