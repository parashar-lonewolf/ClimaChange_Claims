        <p>With drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis spreading in big cities around the country, researchers in New York will begin a six-city test later this year with a 50-year-old technology for killing the bacteria mechanically: ultraviolet lamps.</p>
        <p>Using money from electric utilities, including the Consolidated Edison Company in New York, researchers plan to install the lamps near the ceilings in homeless shelters. For the next six years, scientists will measure the spread of the disease among people who use the shelters and compare the data to the numbers at similar shelters without the lamps.</p>
        <p>The program is expected to cost $4 million and will be formally announced later this month at a meeting of electric utilities. Some of the details, including precisely which shelters will be studied, have not been settled.</p>
        <p>Ultraviolet lamps are available commercially to kill germs in water, and for decades scientists have recognized that ultraviolet light works well on tuberculosis bacteria in air; that is why sanitariums used to sterilize their linen in sunlight. And there are laboratory tests that show that the lamps will kill bacteria in air. But no one has demonstrated the effectiveness of indoor ultraviolet lighting in slowing the spread of the disease. 'Nobody Bothered'</p>
        <p>The study's organizer, Dr. Philip W. Brickner, chairman of the community medicine department at St. Vincent's Hospital, which specializes in bringing health care to the homeless, said that when he finished medical school in 1954, the lamps were widely believed to cut spread of the disease. "But nobody bothered with it because drugs had come along," he said. Streptomycin became widely available in the late 1940's, after which drugs became the main treatment.</p>
        <p>For the next four decades tuberculosis was in steady decline, because drugs worked and because a general rise in living standards was helping to ameliorate the conditions in which the disease spreads. Doctors say those conditions are poor nutrition, crowding, poor ventilation and alcoholism. By 1985 the level declined to 22,200 new cases.</p>
        <p>But then it began rising. Dr. Brickner and colleagues at St. Vincent's documented the beginning of the re-emergence of the disease in 1977, among people who later came to be known as the homeless, who were often malnourished and overcrowded. Since the late 1970's, he said in an interview, "the world has turned upside down," and those conditions have been widely re-created.</p>
        <p>Another problem is that some people with TB began treatments but did not follow through with them, which helped the bacteria mutate into resistant strains. Now there are strains that no drug will cure.</p>
        <p>And a new factor makes the disease more deadly: AIDS. Patients who have AIDS succumb quickly to TB, doctors say. Variety of Settings</p>
        <p>In 1992, the last year for which statistics are complete, the Federal Government counted 26,700 new cases of tuberculosis, a 20 percent jump from the low point in 1985. The victims come from a variety of settings. In 1991, researchers say, 13 prisoners and one prison guard died; in 1992 a flight attendant on Continental Airlines infected 23 crew members. Both prisons and airliners are good candidates for the ultraviolet technology, said Dr. Brickner; in fact, he said, any public building might benefit.</p>
        <p>Some hospitals and at least one shelter use ultraviolet light already. Dr. Edward A. Nardell, an adviser to the project and the tuberculosis control officer for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, said the Pine Street Inn, a shelter in Boston, had installed the lamps years ago.</p>
        <p>Ultraviolet light is not visible to the human eye, but the lamps also produce a faint bluish glow. Dr. Nardell said that at the Pine Street Inn the lamps produce a level of illumination "like a night-light." The lamps send beams across the upper part of the room, and natural air circulation moves all the air through the beams bit by bit, he said.</p>
        <p>Placement of the lamps is important because some forms of ultraviolet light produced by the sun cause skin cancer and cataracts. Those forms, the kind that sunglasses and skin block are designed to protect against, are known as UV-A and UV-B. The kind that will be used in the shelter, called UV-C, is also made by the sun but cannot penetrate the earth's atmosphere. This is true even with the depletion of the ozone layer, which scientists blame for increased levels of UV-A and UV-B on the earth's surface.  'The Full Whack'</p>
        <p>According to Dr. Nardell, most of the UV-C stays near the ceiling, and of the portion that reaches room occupants, 95 percent is stopped by the stratum corneum, the layer of dead cells on the skin. But the bacterium in air, he said, "is such a tiny droplet that it's not protected, and it gets the full whack of this energy."</p>
        <p>Dr. Brickner said that a person who intentionally stared at a source of UV-C could develop an irritation of the eye called conjunctivitis but that this would pass quickly.</p>
        <p>Dr. Brickner is to announce the program at a meeting later this month of the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit utility consortium based in Palo Alto, Calif.</p>
        <p>The institute is always looking for new markets for electricity. But Arthur A. Kressner, manager of exploratory research and development at Consolidated Edison, said the amounts involved in this program were very small, only about one watt per 10 square feet of floor space, about a tenth the amount used for lighting. Utilities in Los Angeles, Chicago, New Orleans and Birmingham, Ala., may also participate, he said.</p>
        <p>The six cities have not been selected for the project. Dr. Brickner said a deciding factor would be the availability of two shelters in each city with similar populations and physical characteristics, like ventilation.</p>
        <p>An alternative to ultraviolet lighting, used by some hospitals and shelters, is increased ventilation. But, Dr. Nardell said in an interview, "the problem with ventilation is you can only use so much air." And there are no good data on the effectiveness of added ventilation either, he said.</p>
