        <p>Sports Authority Inc., a chain of sports-equipment stores, was cited by the city yesterday for selling imitation semiautomatic machine guns that are strikingly similar to the real thing, the Department of Consumer Affairs said.</p>
        <p>''These are very dangerous,'' Gretchen Dykstra, the consumer affairs commissioner, said yesterday morning as she stood outside a Manhattan Sports Authority store with two of the black aluminum-and-plastic guns displayed on the sidewalk. ''People have been walking by and looking at these and saying, 'They've got real guns!' ''</p>
        <p>The fake weapons violate a New York law forbidding the sale or ownership of imitation guns that are realistic-looking and are painted black or gray. To be legal, an imitation gun must be unmistakably fake, she said, and must be either brightly colored, fancifully shaped or both.</p>
        <p>The imitation semiautomatics, which are called markers, are not meant to be children's toys, and are used for the war game paintball -- a cross between capture the flag and a skirmish exercise, in which players try to make it to home base without being blasted by pellets filled with fluorescent goo.</p>
        <p>The imitation weapons are neither inexpensive nor simple. The cost of one on display yesterday was $250, and descriptions on the box said it was powered by a carbon dioxide device, had a range of 150 feet and included features like sighting devices and a quick-release feeder for ammunition.</p>
        <p>The imitation semiautomatics at the Sports Authority stores in Queens were discovered by happenstance, when a city employee noticed an advertisement for one in the newspaper. The city has issued subpoenas to Tippman Pneumatics Inc. in Indiana and Kingman International Corporation in California, which make the guns in the Queens store, to see if they are being sold in other New York stores.</p>
        <p>A hearing for Sports Authority has been scheduled for Nov. 8. The company could face fines as high as $200,000.</p>
        <p>Frank Bubb, a Sports Authority spokesman, said sales of the imitation guns had been suspended in the Queens stores.</p>
        <p>''This is the first time anything like this has ever come up,'' he said. ''I don't know of any other state or city with a law like that. We intend to cooperate with New York in any way we can.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Dykstra said: ''Even if it weren't illegal to possess these, it completely violates common sense. Look at them. Could they look more real? They're really scary. Can you imagine what would happen if somebody went out on the street or down in the subway carrying one of those things?''</p>
