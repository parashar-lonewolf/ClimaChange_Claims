        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki signed two major environmental initiatives into law today, including a ban on the use of a common gasoline additive that has polluted underground water supplies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki also signed legislation that tries to limit the amount of pollutants that now drift into New York from coal-burning power plants in Midwestern and Southern states, causing acid rain. The measure seeks to stop New York companies from selling pollution allowances, which they now earn by cleaning up their own smokestacks, to polluters in those other states.</p>
        <p>The new laws potentially place New York at odds with major provisions of the federal Clean Air Act of 1990 and set the stage for a protracted legal fight with the state's powerful energy and petroleum producers, who called both moves illegal.</p>
        <p>The companies said they were considering court challenges to the two new statutes, asserting that the state had no authority to supersede federal law and, in the process, disrupt two major industries by imposing a different standard than is used in most of the rest of the nation.</p>
        <p>The law limiting pollution credits goes into effect immediately, and the ban on the additive is to take effect in January 2004.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Pataki's action was applauded by a host of environmental groups that have been urging New York to go beyond the requirements of the 1990 federal act in protecting air and water quality in the state.</p>
        <p>The governor's aides today acknowledged the potential legal problems with both laws. But the aides contended that the state's action should, at the very least, send a message to Washington that there were deficiencies in the federal law.</p>
        <p>''We understand that neither legislation is perfect,'' said Michael McKeon, a Pataki spokesman. But he added: ''We want to see a resolution of both these issues on the national level and we think this pushes that debate forward. When New York takes action, the rest of the country listens.''</p>
        <p>David Cohen, a spokesman for the federal Environmental Protection Agency, said he could not comment on the legality of the two new laws, saying it was a matter for the courts to decide. But he said that the agency had the very same concerns that New York had and that it was seeking to address them either through its own regulations or new federal legislation. ''We share the goals of both bills,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''We share the concerns of the state and are working toward the same end.''</p>
        <p>The additive being banned in New York is known as methyl tertiary butyl esther, or M.T.B.E. Under the 1990 Clean Air Act, oil companies had to reformulate gasoline to increase oxygen content. That way, gasoline is able to burn more completely, thereby reducing its toxic emissions.</p>
        <p>The oil industry ultimately settled on M.T.B.E. as the gasoline additive that would best meet the mandate. But there was one major problem: many underground gasoline tanks at gas stations leak, and M.T.B.E. tends to escape much faster than gasoline does, because of its water solubility.</p>
        <p>As a result, M.T.B.E. has tainted the water in an unknown number of places around the country by leaking from underground gasoline tanks. A possible carcinogen, the chemical is also suspected of being toxic to the nervous system when consumed in large quantities. While the exact health effects are unknown, it gives water a powerfully unpleasant odor and taste.</p>
        <p>The New York law would force the petroleum industry to find another additive that would achieve the oxygen-content mandate of the 1990 act.</p>
        <p>The legality of the new law is unclear. The federal act explicitly says states cannot mandate what kind of gasoline additive the petroleum industry must use for the purpose of meeting emissions standards.</p>
        <p>The loophole New York is counting on is that it is not taking action for emission purposes; rather, it is doing so for groundwater purposes. Even if New York's law does not pass legal muster, environmentalists are hoping that the law, in addition to one passed last year in California, will force Congress to set some kind of national standard phasing out the use of M.T.B.E.</p>
        <p>Until now, California was the only state to have a ban on the use of the additive. Gov. Gray Davis banned it by executive order last year, requiring it to be phased out by December 2002. But California does not come under the Clean Air Act restrictions because the state has its own, tougher rules that predate the federal act. Thus, New York is the first state where a state ban might face a challenge as pre-empting the authority of the federal Clean Air Act.</p>
        <p>''Whether or not this law stands up to court challenge, Governor Pataki has sent an important message to the federal government and other states,'' said Ned Sullivan, executive director of Scenic Hudson, an environmental group that lobbied for the new law. ''M.T.B.E.'s must be purged from our fuel supplies.''</p>
        <p>The other bill that the governor signed today would stop New York utility companies from keeping the money they make by selling so-called pollution credits for sulfur dioxide, a major source of acid rain, to large polluters in the Midwest and the South. The pollution from the companies in these states is a major cause of acid rain in environmentally fragile areas of New York like the Adirondacks.</p>
        <p>The credits, essentially the right to pollute, are awarded to companies that cut their own emissions below a federal standard. The credits are now sold on the open market, usually to utilities with older power plants that find it cheaper to buy such credits instead of modernizing their plants and cutting their emissions.</p>
        <p>The new law calls for the state to seize all proceeds that a New York utility makes from selling its credits to polluters in the Midwest and the South. The law allows state regulators to impose a fine equal to the amount of such a sale; the fine would be used to promote development and the use of nonpolluting energy sources like solar power.</p>
        <p>The new law poses a major obstacle to a provision of the Clean Air Act that set up a marketplace in which companies can trade the right to pollute, in the form of credits, as a commodity. The goal of that provision is to reward companies that reduce their toxic emissions below the federal standard, while forcing companies that exceed the standard to buy the right to continue polluting.</p>
        <p>The New York law drew sharp attacks from representatives of the state's utility industry, who said it potentially violates the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution, which bars states from enacting laws that restrict trade outside their borders. They said they would consider challenging the measure in court.</p>
        <p>The law prohibits power companies from selling their pollution credits to companies in 10 Southern and Midwestern states by fining utilities making such sales. Those states are Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, West Virginia, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Kentucky, Indiana and Wisconsin. It also prohibits sales to four states that are closer to home: New Jersey, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Delaware.</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 29, 2000, Monday  An article on Thursday about two environmental measures signed into law by Gov. George E. Pataki misspelled part of the name of the gasoline additive known as MTBE, which one of them will ban. It is methyl tertiary butyl ether, not esther.</p>
