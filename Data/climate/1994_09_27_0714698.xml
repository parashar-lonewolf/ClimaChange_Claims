        <p>EVER since explorers at the turn of the century surmised that the emperor penguin must breed during the coldest part of Antarctica's deadly winter, this charming but peculiar species has inspired wonder and curiosity. But after 83 years of penguin watching, scientists are still encountering surprises, including a recent discovery made with a night-vision device that revealed emperor penguins to be even hardier than had been supposed.</p>
        <p>Knowledge of the winter behavior of emperor penguins has come slowly because it is hard for human beings to survive under such conditions, much less conduct scientific research. High winds, temperatures around minus 60 degrees Fahrenheit, round-the-clock darkness and frequent sudden blizzards make the Antarctic habitat of the emperors, the Ross Sea and McMurdo Sound, dangerous places in winter.</p>
        <p>In 1911 a trio of intrepid English explorers confirmed the theory that emperor penguins, unlike other birds, do indeed lay and incubate their eggs during the dead of the polar winter. Two of these brave investigators, Dr. Edward A. Wilson and Henry Bowers, were doomed to die of starvation and exposure with Capt. Robert F. Scott a year later while returning from their ill-fated expedition to the South Pole.</p>
        <p>Risking their lives in the darkness by climbing down a 200-foot cliff in a bitterly cold wind, Dr. Wilson, Mr. Bowers and Apsley Cherry-Garrard succeeded in reaching a midwinter emperor penguin rookery at Cape Crozier on Ross Island. Collecting five penguin eggs with very young embryos for later studies of biological development, the explorers noticed that the big birds had chosen a spot offering substantial shelter from the wind.</p>
        <p>Ever since then, scientists had assumed that all emperor penguin rookeries must be similarly placed, so a recent discovery by Dr. Gerald Kooyman of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography came as a surprise. During a nonstop jet flight last June from New Zealand to the South Pole and back, Dr. Kooyman scanned the darkened expanse of sea ice near Ross Island using an image intensifier of the kind supplied to American forces in the Vietnam and Persian Gulf wars.</p>
        <p>For human beings, Antarctica is closed to the outer world during the winter months, from March through August, and only in dire emergencies do airplanes from New Zealand or Chile attempt to land on the continent's treacherous ice runways. But each winter the National Science Foundation arranges one flight from New Zealand to airdrop fresh vegetables and mail to the inhabitants of McMurdo and South Pole Stations. Dr. Kooyman took advantage of this winter's 13-hour flight to spy on the emperors.</p>
        <p>From his perch aboard a KC-10 tanker aircraft 10,000 feet above the frozen sea, Dr. Kooyman spotted a cluster of about 7,000 emperor penguins huddled together on sea ice west of Ross Island, a considerable distance from the shelter of cliffs. It was instantly clear that emperor penguins can breed even in the absence of any kind of shelter.</p>
        <p>"They were all males, of course," he said, "and each one was presumably incubating an egg." Male emperor penguins are known to take over the incubation of eggs for nine weeks, going without food the whole time while their mates return to the open sea to fatten up on deep-dwelling fish.</p>
        <p>The emperor penguins' strategy for keeping warm in winds of minus 60 degrees Fahrenheit, Dr. Kooyman said, is to keep shuffling around and jostling their neighbors, taking care to keep their big eggs wedged between the tops of their feet and their warm, overhanging bellies. The penguins at the exposed periphery of a cluster generally manage to work their way inside after a fairly brief period acting as community windshields.</p>
        <p>Scientists do not know how long an emperor usually remains at the exposed edge of a community "huddle," or how rapidly the entire huddle moves. Weather conditions and the stability and thickness of the sea ice on which they stand are believed to be factors.</p>
        <p>"So few of these birds have ever been tagged that we have little knowledge of their individual movements," Dr. Kooyman said. "We suspect that movement is weather-dependent; in mild weather with low winds, the huddle probably loosens up, while high winds and low temperatures draw the birds together and increase the speed of their movements. There may also be a learning curve. It may take inexperienced birds a while to learn how to jockey for position."</p>
        <p>Both male and female emperor penguins protect their eggs and newly hatched chicks by enveloping them under a fold of body skin. During the first part of the reproductive cycle the mothers must fast, but after eggs are laid, they leave to fatten up. The males then take over, incubating the eggs and the newly hatched chicks for the nine midwinter weeks. The part of the bird's belly in contact with the egg is bare of feathers to facilitate the flow of heat from the father to his offspring. At the end of their baby-sitting stint, the fathers turn the chicks over to their returning mothers, and go back to sea.</p>
        <p>If weather conditions become so severe that a parent's resources can no longer cope with the cold, it abandons the egg to save itself, as it may do under certain other circumstances. All penguin rookeries are littered with abandoned eggs and dead chicks.</p>
        <p>In many other ways as well the emperor penguin differs from about 16 other penguin species, whose ranges extend from Antarctica to the equatorial Galapagos Islands. Standing more than 3 feet high and weighing some 90 pounds, the emperors are the largest of all penguins. Emperors and Adelie penguins are the only two penguin species inhabiting the Antarctic continent proper, although other species live among the northern islands of Antarctica.</p>
        <p>Adelies breed in the Antarctic spring on densely populated rocky rookeries, and before the summer sun sets in March, at the beginning of the long winter night, the chicks are mature enough to look after themselves. But as early as 1911, investigators realized that emperor penguins had to contend with an unusual reproductive problem: their chicks mature too slowly to permit a normal avian breeding cycle.</p>
        <p>In his 1923 memoir, "The Worst Journey in the World," Mr. Cherry-Garrard recounted the discovery that if emperor penguins had to begin breeding in springtime like the Adelies, their chicks would still be immature and lacking sufficient feathers and body fat by the time winter set in.</p>
        <p>Emperors have some other characteristics that intrigue scientists, including their ability to hunt for prey at great depths. "We've measured emperor dives to depths as great as 630 meters," or 2,070 feet, Dr. Kooyman said. "They are surely the deepest-diving birds in the world."</p>
        <p>Dr. Kooyman plans to return to Antarctica next month to study the birds at close hand during the summer. The penguins themselves seem to welcome human visitors. Although they are frightened by helicopters flying overhead, a helicopter that lands on the sea ice quickly draws crowds of the birds, all honking enthusiastically and waddling up as fast as their feet can carry them.</p>
        <p>Scientists regard Antarctica as a kind of gauge for measuring the health of the global environment, and one of the indicators is the waxing or waning of animal populations, including those of penguins. Among the potentially adverse affects on the Antarctic environment is the impact of increasing tourism.</p>
        <p>But Dr. William Fraser of Montana State University recently reported an anomaly in penguin colonies that remains to be explained. Two islands near Palmer Station on the Antarctic Peninsula, Torgerson and Litchfield, both have large populations of Adelie penguins. Tourists are allowed to visit Torgerson, and even nesting penguins have become accustomed to having people around. But Litchfield is strictly off-limits. Although Litchfield and Torgerson are right next to each other, the Adelie population of protected Litchfield has declined 43 percent since 1992, while the population of Torgerson fell only 19 percent.</p>
        <p>The reason, Dr. Fraser said, apparently has nothing to do with tourists, but is the result of weather. For the last 20 years, he said, the region near Palmer Station has been steadily warming, and this has resulted in increased snowfall every winter. But the snow does not accumulate evenly; the prevailing storm winds sweeping the Antarctic Peninsula come from the northeast, and snow tends to pile up on the lee side southwest of hills and rocks.</p>
        <p>Torgerson Island is fairly flat and snow is quickly swept away, but Litchfield has many rocky pinnacles and obstructions, behind which snow accumulates to depths of three feet or so. Adelie penguins are programmed by nature to follow a tight reproductive schedule, and the peak of their egg-laying period is 10 days from Nov. 18 to 28. If snow deeply covers their rookery during that period, high infant mortality results.</p>
        <p>A continuous warming trend on the Antarctic Peninsula has been measured since 1974, but Dr. Fraser believes that the Adelie population has been declining for as long as 50 years because of warming and consequent changes in weather patterns. Few scientists believe there are enough data yet to prove that global warming is responsible, but specialists are keeping a close watch on Antarctica.</p>
        <p>"The answer requires the long-term data we're now collecting," Dr. Fraser said.</p>
