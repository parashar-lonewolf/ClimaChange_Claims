        <p>LEAD: After nine months of haggling with the Administration, Congress today neared final approval of a plan that relies heavily on new taxes and continuation of across-the-board budget cuts to pare $14.7 billion from the Federal deficit.</p>
        <p>After nine months of haggling with the Administration, Congress today neared final approval of a plan that relies heavily on new taxes and continuation of across-the-board budget cuts to pare $14.7 billion from the Federal deficit.</p>
        <p>Despite President Bush's campaign pledge for no new taxes and lawmakers' pledges to end the automatic spending cuts that have been in effect since Oct. 1, the measure was accepted by the Administration and Congressional leaders in a closed bargaining session that ended early this morning. The House and Senate are expected to vote on the plan and send it to Mr. Bush as their final action before adjourning until Jan. 23.</p>
        <p>More than a third of the deficit reduction, or $4.6 billion, would be achieved by allowing the automatic cuts to remain in effect through the first week of February. The cuts affect a wide array of domestic and military programs, but under the deficit agreement their impact would be felt most directly by the disabled and elderly Americans who receive health benefits under Medicare; those benefits have been cut by 2 percent since mid-October, a cut that would not be made up. Array of New Taxes</p>
        <p>At least $2.9 billion of the deficit reduction is to come from tax increases and tightening tax breaks, including new taxes on international airline and cruise-ship tickets, new Social Security taxes for those in certain deferred-compensation plans, and new taxes on oil producers and producers of chemicals that deplete the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>Lawmakers said the package was the best they could do after weeks of wearying negotiations that pitted the House against the Senate, and in many cases Congress against the Administration. And the White House budget director, Richard G. Darman, told reporters that it might be the best deficit reduction plan in years.</p>
        <p>Congressional budget makers in both parties were less effusive. They said the package had its shortcomings, particularly the decision to let the automatic cuts continue rather than end immediately. The cuts were mandated by the 1987 budget-balancing law, which requires automatic reductions if Congress and the White House cannot agree how to cut the deficit. A Smile and a Wink</p>
        <p>''In the final analysis we were forced to fall back on the sequester,'' said the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Jim Sasser, Democrat of Tennessee, using the formal name for the automatic spending cuts.</p>
        <p>Asked about the new taxes, Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the senior Republican on the budget panel, evoked an observation of Mr. Darman, who said earlier this year that closing tax loopholes is not the same as raising taxes - that if something looks and sounds like a duck it probably is one. Today, with a wink and a smile, Mr. Domenici said of the revenue measures, ''Well, I think the best way to say it is that they are not ducks.'' After a long pause, he added that an average person would not classify most of the revenue measures as tax increases.</p>
        <p>Mr. Domenici noted that President Bush had agreed with Congress early this year that part of the deficit reduction would be achieved with $5.3 billion in new revenue. Mr. Bush had argued that some of the money would come from cutting the tax rate for capital gains, which produces extra revenue at the outset as investors cash in their assets to take advantage of the lower rate. When the capital gains cut was blocked, lawmakers in both parties, with the Administration's consent, found other ways to raise the revenue. Cuts Vs. Gimmicks</p>
        <p>Part of the final compromise involved some new spending and some losses in revenue to accommodate program expansions and tax breaks that lawmakers in both parties sought. For example, the plan includes a $148 million expansion of the Medicaid program that will provide additional health coverage for pregnant women, infants and young children. It also includes a nine-month extension of about a dozen popular tax breaks, at a cost to the Treasury of about $1.4 billion.</p>
        <p>Like all budget measures, the deficit reduction plan is a tangle of conflicting estimates of what will actually be saved or spent. But in this case the arithmetic was particularly subjective, because Congress and the Administration disagree on what is a genuine spending cut and what is simply an accounting gimmick.</p>
        <p>So great was the confusion that by late today, neither the Administration nor the budget experts in Congress could say with certainty what the deficit would be in the fiscal year 1990 as a result of the cuts.</p>
