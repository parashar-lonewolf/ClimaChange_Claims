        <p>LEAD: President Bush called on the Soviet Union and its allies today to end the division of Europe.</p>
        <p>President Bush called on the Soviet Union and its allies today to end the division of Europe.</p>
        <p>In the major foreign policy speech of his European tour - and an effort to match and counter initiatives by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union - Mr. Bush outlined proposals ''to heal Europe's tragic division, to help Europe become whole and free.''</p>
        <p>''The cold war began with the division of Europe,'' the President said. ''It can only end when Europe is whole. There cannot be a common European home until all within are free to move from room to room.''  [ Excerpts, page A13. ]  Elections and Openness Mr. Bush offered four steps for unifying Europe:</p>
        <p>* The promotion of ''free elections and political pluralism in Eastern Europe.'' Mr. Bush called on the political parties of the West ''to lend counsel and support to those brave men and women who are trying to form the first truly representative political parties in the East.''</p>
        <p>* The tearing down of the Berlin wall. ''It must come down,'' he said.</p>
        <p>* An invitation to Western environmentalists and engineers to share knowledge with those in the East struggling to deal with acid rain and polluted rivers. ''America has faced an environmental tragedy in Alaska,'' Mr. Bush said, adding: ''Countries from France to Finland suffered after Chernobyl. Environmental destruction respects no borders.''</p>
        <p>* An appeal to the Soviet Union to join in Mr. Bush's new proposals to reduce conventional forces in Europe. Publicity Courted</p>
        <p>His speech, before a group of 3,500 Germans in a flag-draped auditorium in Mainz, was televised throughout West Germany and broadcast live by some American networks. White House officials said Mr. Bush was seeking to reach the widest possible audience in Europe as well as the United States.</p>
        <p>White House officials said the speech was intended to serve as the political counterpart to arms initiatives the President offered to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization two days ago.</p>
        <p>It was also designed to seize the public relations initiative from Mr. Gorbachev, and Mr. Bush used Mr. Gorbachev's own words against him, although the speech contained no direct criticism of the Soviet leader. ''Glasnost may be a Russian word, but openness is a Western concept,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Bring glasnost to East Berlin,'' he said at another point. A Process That Has Begun</p>
        <p>The President's remarks were framed in such a way that they did not take into account the growing movement of peoples already taking place between East and West in Europe. While West Germans would welcome the destruction of the wall dividing the two parts of Berlin as a symbolic easing of tensions, if the removal of the wall led to a vast influx of people from Eastern Europe into the West, this would cause severe problems for West Europeans already worried about growing numbers of East European refugees in their midst, He also skirted the issue of German reunification, saying he favored ''self-determination for all of Germany and all of Eastern Europe,''but without saying that he explicitly wanted a merger of the two states. The topic stirs passions in both East and West. Most West Germans favor unification with East Germany, but many other Europeans express concern over such a development.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush called his four proposals ''the foundation of our larger vision -a Europe that is free and at peace with itself.''</p>
        <p>''Let the Soviets know that our goal is not to undermine their legitimate security interests,'' he said. ''Our goal is to convince them, step by step, that their definition of security is obsolete, that their deepest fears are unfounded.'' Propping Up Kohl</p>
        <p>White House aides said that the President came to Mainz, an old wine port on the Rhine River, at the request of Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany, whose popularity has been falling. Mr. Kohl is from the surrounding state, Rhineland-Palatinate, and Mr. Bush's visit to its capital was meant to stir support for the Chancellor's Christian Democratic Party in city and state elections on June 18.</p>
        <p>''Kohl asked us to come, so we did a campaign swing through the Rhineland,'' an American official said.</p>
        <p>The West German Chancellor, in his remarks before Mr. Bush, seemed to echo some of the President's views.</p>
        <p>''For the first time since the end of World War II,'' he said, ''we stand a realistic chance of escaping the shadow of the East-West conflict. Soviet policy is now more amenable to compromise, more open to dialogue and cooperation,'' he said. After a Sail, Britain</p>
        <p>After Mr. Bush's speech in Mainz, the President and his wife, Barbara, joined Mr. Kohl and his wife, Hannelore, for a nearly two-hour trip aboard an excursion cruise ship from Oberwesel to Koblenz.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush called it ''an unforgettable day'' as he left for London for meetings with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and a visit with Queen Elizabeth II. Earlier in the day in Bonn, the President met privately with Mr. Kohl for more than an hour, and then spoke briefly to several hundred American residents, including schoolchildren, in the backyard of the official residence of the U.S. Ambassador, Vernon A. Walters. Then he flew by helicopter to Mainz, a 40-minute trip.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's speech, timed for delivery at midday to enable the American television networks to carry it on morning news programs, was enthusiastically applauded by a handpicked audience of Mainz residents.</p>
        <p>The President's theme was that demands for democracy in Communist countries, including China, had produced a ''ferment'' that demanded a response from the leaders of those countries. ''The passion for freedom cannot be denied forever,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''The momentum for freedom does not just come from the printed word, the transistor or the television screen,'' Mr. Bush said. ''It comes from the power of a single idea - democracy.'' Open Societies</p>
        <p>''This one idea is why the Communist world, from Budapest to Beijing, is in ferment,'' said the President, who plans a visit in July to Hungary and Poland, where steps have been taken toward free and open elections.</p>
        <p>''As President, I will continue to do all I can to open the closed societies of the East,'' Mr. Bush said. ''We seek self-determination for all of Germany and all of Eastern Europe. We will not relax. We must not waver. Again, the world has waited long enough.''</p>
        <p>Although some of Mr. Bush's recent foreign policy speeches have been criticized, even within the White House, as lackluster, today's 30-minute address seemed pointed and finely tuned. The speech was written by Mark Davis, a former aide to then-Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, who is now on the White House staff, and shaped two days ago in a late-night session in Brussels by Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser; John H. Sununu, the chief of staff; David Demarest, director of White House communications, and several other officials.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush offered a veiled criticism of some German and other West European officials who have criticized his Administration for its tentative response to arms control.</p>
        <p>''To those who are impatient with our measured pace in arms reductions,'' he said, ''I respectfully suggest that history teaches us a lesson - that unity and strength are the catalyst and prerequisite to arms control.''</p>
