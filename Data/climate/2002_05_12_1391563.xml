        <p>Last August I spent a couple of days with a group of friends in the small town of Yusufeli, in Turkey's remote northeast. I didn't realize at the time that this might be my last chance to do so. Yusufeli has a rough and ready air, and the hotels are spartan, but with its beer gardens and restaurants suspended above the raging waters of the Barhal River, it has a certain raffish charm. In the last two decades it has become increasingly popular with foreign visitors. Numbers have tripled, and with good reason: the surrounding landscape of soaring mountains, alpine meadows and sheer-sided canyons is spectacular. It is also completely unspoiled, and scattered with magnificent Georgian churches, built mostly in the 10th century by the princes of Tayk-Tao. If you want to see the churches, go trekking in the mountains or rafting on the rivers, you have to stay in Yusufeli, a minimum of three hours from Istanbul by plane and bus.</p>
        <p>Not being the trekking or rafting kind, I and my four friends had come to see the churches. These are among the great masterpieces of medieval architecture, and on our way to Yusufeli from Erzurum (the nearest town with an airport) we had already seen three. At Haho, Osk Vank and Ishan we were left nearly breathless with amazement. Their sheer scale and ambition put us in mind of Chartres, yet these were much earlier. Clearly the people of this small and obscure Georgian principality had been far in advance of Western Europe. We were fascinated and determined to see more. On the next day we did so, and encountered the kind of problems that face the inhabitants of this rugged terrain on a regular basis, problems that will soon be made infinitely worse.</p>

        <p>Last August I spent a couple of days with a group of friends in the small town of Yusufeli, in Turkey's remote northeast. I didn't realize at the time that this might be my last chance to do so. Yusufeli has a rough and ready air, and the hotels are spartan, but with its beer gardens and restaurants suspended above the raging waters of the Barhal River, it has a certain raffish charm. In the last two decades it has become increasingly popular with foreign visitors. Numbers have tripled, and with good reason: the surrounding landscape of soaring mountains, alpine meadows and sheer-sided canyons is spectacular. It is also completely unspoiled, and scattered with magnificent Georgian churches, built mostly in the 10th century by the princes of Tayk-Tao. If you want to see the churches, go trekking in the mountains or rafting on the rivers, you have to stay in Yusufeli, a minimum of three hours from Istanbul by plane and bus.</p>
        <p>Not being the trekking or rafting kind, I and my four friends had come to see the churches. These are among the great masterpieces of medieval architecture, and on our way to Yusufeli from Erzurum (the nearest town with an airport) we had already seen three. At Haho, Osk Vank and Ishan we were left nearly breathless with amazement. Their sheer scale and ambition put us in mind of Chartres, yet these were much earlier. Clearly the people of this small and obscure Georgian principality had been far in advance of Western Europe. We were fascinated and determined to see more. On the next day we did so, and encountered the kind of problems that face the inhabitants of this rugged terrain on a regular basis, problems that will soon be made infinitely worse.</p>
        <p>At the church of Barhal, we heard distant thunder. Faik, our driver, was immediately alarmed and insisted that we leave. We soon discovered why. Rounding the corner of a narrow, twisting valley at great speed, we ran into what may be the most violent rainstorm I have ever witnessed. Hundreds of waterfalls had appeared where previously there had been none. Around another corner a substantial rock slide blocked the road. Since a waterfall was pouring onto the road behind us, it was essential that we get past this barrier fast. Clearing a rock slide with your bare hands in torrential rain is discouraging work, but -- this being Turkey -- a small boy soon appeared out of nowhere with a shovel that was much taller than he. Faik dug us out with practiced skill, but as we rounded the last bend, I happened to look back and saw perhaps five large boulders roll gently down onto the road: they had missed us by seconds.</p>
        <p>We had more serious cause for alarm on the following day, when we took a minibus to Artvin, the provincial capital. According to my map this should not have been a problem. The road ran straight along the valley of the Coruh, the principal river and lifeline of this isolated province, but about 10 miles from the town the valley was closed off, and we were forced to embark on a grueling 25-mile diversion. It felt much longer. The boulder-strewn road was unfinished, and wound along a sheer mountainside. And it was raining hard. Our overcrowded minibus wobbled and swerved, then, as Artvin at last came into view, our way was blocked by a second, and much more serious, landslide made up of large boulders and a lot of very sticky mud. None of our fellow travelers seemed to think this was anything out of the ordinary, and before long large, earth-moving vehicles were brought into play. In less than half an hour we were able to move on. It was then that we discovered the reason for our ordeal. Below us, in the Coruh Valley, a huge construction project was in progress. The landscape was being radically revised, but to what end was unclear. We were soon enlightened.</p>
        <p>When we checked into our hotel, we fell into conversation with its proprietors -- two jovial but tough-looking brothers -- who said: ''Oh, you have come from Yusufeli. Soon it will be drowned.'' ''What?'' we cried collectively. ''Yes, they are building five big dams on the Coruh, and smaller dams on the other rivers.'' ''But this is terrible.'' ''Well, what can we do? And it will bring jobs. No one has work.''</p>
        <p>I felt slightly dazed. A town I had just visited, where I had met charming and friendly people, was about to be obliterated. It was difficult to imagine. It had seemed such a vital place. Of course, I knew about Turkey's dam-building mania (an obsession it shares with India and China), but, after the controversy over the Ilsu dam in the mainly Kurdish southeast, I had hoped it might be on the wane. No such luck. According to the Web site of the Artvin provincial government, the plan, scheduled for completion in 2008, calls for 10 dams on the Coruh alone, starting within a few miles of the Georgian border. It goes on to state that virtually the whole 300-mile valley would be flooded. The waters will inevitably spread into the valleys of the Coruh's many tributaries, at least two of which will also have dams of their own. At least 15 villages and small towns will be drowned or otherwise rendered uninhabitable, and, again according to the provincial government, at least 15,000 people will by displaced in Artvin alone.</p>
        <p>The drowning of Yusufeli would destroy tourism, and a landscape of primordial splendor would be changed beyond recognition. And what of the region's other great attraction, the Georgian churches? Of the ones that lie closest to Yusufeli and the Coruh, Ishan is so high that the waters would not touch it, but, since the valley below it would be flooded, it is difficult to know how anyone would get to it. The case of the exquisite monastery of Dort Kilise is much more worrying. There are two churches (one with priceless frescoes), a scriptorium and a magnificent refectory. The monastery is hidden in an idyllic, wooded valley just a few miles from the village of Tekkale, but if the Yusufeli dam is completed, Tekkale will be submerged. Dort Kilise stands higher than Tekkale, but the climb is neither long nor steep, and the dam is projected to be more than 900 feet high. This should be more than enough to doom the place. Even if it escapes drowning, it would presumably be cut off from the outside world, and the rapidly fading frescoes are in urgent need of conservation. Small wonder that the Turkish Chamber of Architects has complained, in an Internet publication, with some bitterness, that the entire project was planned without consideration of its cultural and environmental consequences.</p>
        <p>Turks, of course, do not bear all the blame for the likely despoiling of this dramatically beautiful region. It could not happen without foreign investment. A chief backer has been the French contracting and construction company Spie Batignolle, of which 46 percent is owned by the British company Amec. In March, however, in response to widespread criticism in Britain, Amec pulled out of the deal.</p>
        <p>This might seem to put the plan in some doubt. But Erol Calimli, head of the dams unit of Turkey's General Directorate of State Hydraulic Works, says: ''It is true that Amec has pulled out. However, its share of the project was only 9 to 10 percent, not 46 percent. I wouldn't know their reasons for this decision since I am involved in the technical aspects of the project. Otherwise, Spie Batignolle is still the main contractor of the project. The project is moving ahead and the Treasury Department is now assessing its financial matters.''</p>
        <p>The full environmental impact of the damming lies beyond the scope of this article, and, not surprisingly, very little information has been made public, but climate change seems inevitable. With so many valleys under water, the rains will get heavier, and landslides will increase correspondingly. Roads, and much of the region's scarce arable land, will disappear. Communities will be cut off from the outside world. There is also the question of how feasible the project will be in purely utilitarian terms. The rivers carry vast amounts of silt and debris, more than enough to interfere with the operation of even the most technically advanced hydroelectric plan.</p>
        <p>Despite this, construction of the first three dams on the lower Coruh is already well advanced. Last year there was no sign of construction at Yusufeli, so there is perhaps a faint hope that the government will yet curtail the project. I am not optimistic. According to some reports, there are plans to bulldoze the town this July, even before it is flooded.</p>
