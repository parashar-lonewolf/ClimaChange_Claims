        <p>The Senate defeated a bill on Thursday to combat global warming by restricting the emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases.</p>
        <p>The 55-to-43 vote was the Senate's first vote on such a bill, and proponents said it had won a surprising amount of support, signaling that the concept of a policy on global warming has gained traction.</p>
        <p>The measure's opponents, meanwhile, hailed the defeat, saying it was a vindication of their view that the bill would harm the economy and drive companies overseas.</p>
        <p>Six Republicans joined Democrats in backing the measure, breaking ranks with the Bush administration, which opposes mandatory controls.</p>
        <p>The bill's sponsors, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, said the vote was a first step in an inevitable move toward reducing the human contribution to global warming.</p>
        <p>''We will be back on this issue just like we were back on the issue of campaign finance reform,'' Mr. McCain said in the Senate debate.</p>
        <p>The Republican senators backing the bill were Mr. McCain, Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine, Judd Gregg of New Hampshire and Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island.</p>
        <p>The vote was the first time the Senate has taken up specific legislation to restrict emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases. In 1997, just before the talks that eventually led to the international climate treaty known as the Kyoto Protocol, senators passed a resolution to reject any treaty that significantly harmed the American economy or that failed to include third-world countries. The protocol, which was rejected by President Bush in 2001, did exempt developing countries.</p>
        <p>Thursday's vote, supporters of the bill said, reflected a growing concern among voters about global warming. Recent polls, including one by The New York Times, show that Americans strongly support actions to curb emissions of heat-trapping gases.</p>
        <p>In the poll, conducted Sept. 15 and 16, 66 percent of the 675 adults surveyed said they knew at least something about global warming. More than 80 percent supported higher mileage standards for cars and trucks as a way to cut climate and pollution risks, and 69 percent said they would support such standards even if it meant paying more for a car.</p>
        <p>Attitudes about higher prices for gasoline or other fuels, however, were mixed. When asked if they would be willing to pay an extra 25 cents a gallon for gasoline to reduce pollution and global warming, 50 percent of those familiar with the issue said no, while 46 percent said yes.</p>
        <p>Opponents of the bill said the support it had received meant little, because the senators were aware that the bill would never win approval in the House. Many voted for it only because doing so allowed them to gain points with environmentalists while avoiding true political costs, the opponents said.</p>
        <p>''In actuality,'' said Scott Segal, executive director of the Electric Reliability Coordination Council, a coalition of six major power companies, ''the vote shows that most senators are extremely reluctant to potentially handicap the U.S. economy and energy production.''</p>
        <p>The backers of the bill argued that not taking action to slow global warming would also have severe economic consequences. In the debate, Senator Daniel Akaka, Democrat of Hawaii, and Senator Snowe, of Maine, said that rising sea levels and increasing temperatures would hurt agriculture and tourism in their states.</p>
        <p>The United States, with less than 5 percent of the world's population, accounts for 25 percent of carbon dioxide emissions worldwide.</p>
        <p>The bill would have required that companies restrict carbon dioxide emissions so that they will be no higher in 2010 than they were in 2000. Homes, farms and small businesses would have been exempt.</p>
        <p>The proposal was far more modest than the Kyoto Protocol, which called for a 7 percent reduction in emissions in the United States from 1990 levels by 2010. The protocol also included a second phase that was to begin in 2016.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain and Mr. Lieberman modeled the bill after acid rain programs that were included in 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act.</p>
