        <p>NOW drivers on Interstate 95 in New Haven can see what is being billed as the world's largest natural history mural of dinosaurs: ''The Age of Reptiles,'' by Rudolph Zallinger.</p>
        <p>The work, adapted from the Pulitzer Prize-winning original (housed permanently in the great hall of dinosaurs at the Peabody Museum of Natural History) to epic poster proportions of 72 feet by 36 feet, has been wrapped around a Wyatt Energy Inc. oil tank in New Haven Harbor where it will be seen by more than 200,000 daily commuters and others traversing the Quinnipiac River Bridge.</p>
        <p>The beautification project, featuring one of the city's finest treasures, represents a partnership between  New Haven, the Peabody Museum of Natural History and Wyatt Energy.  At a ribbon-cutting installation-lunch attended by 400 people -- including lots of wide-eyed children -- held late last month in the museum's hall of dinosaurs, those responsible spoke of its inception, of a project that proved to be symbolic of opening doors, bridging generations and a community together.</p>
        <p>The director of the Peabody Museum, Richard L. Burger, said, ''We were exploring ideas of how Peabody's attractions could be communicated to a much larger audience, especially people outside the immediate New Haven area.</p>
        <p>''We thought of options like billboards at the airport. Then the idea of an oil tank as a natural billboard emerged,'' he added. ''The resonance of containers that hold fossil fuels with an image and sense of those fossil fuels seemed especially appropriate.''</p>
        <p>It was easy to dream -- to conjure up the implementation of one of the museum's more famous holdings, ''The Age of Reptiles'' mural in this way. Initially they were unsure it was feasible to do justice to the original work of art.</p>
        <p>''Fortunately,'' Mr. Burger added, ''because of the revolution in computerized graphics and large-scale adhesive materials, it was possible to put a near-perfect image of the mural directly on the tank by using a scanned digitized fragment of the original painting.''</p>
        <p>From idea to completion took two and a half years. Part of the coming together was gaining the support of the city; another was finding a sponsor.</p>
        <p>Stanford N. Phelps, chairman of Wyatt Energy, which stores oil and gas for New Haven and other communities, saw the magic and was willing to do that.</p>
        <p>''This is not commercial,'' he said. ''It's to help the city. If you like children, you'll like this.'' His 4-year-old grandson Maxwell Phelps, Sasha Burger, 8, daughter of Peabody's director, and Tiffany Waddley, 9, a representative of L.E.A.P. (Leadership, Education and Athletics in Partnership), as well as Jean Zallinger, Mr. Zallinger's widow, all took part in the celebration.</p>
        <p>The ribbon-cutting took place around a table that held a model of the poster-emblazoned oil tank and harbor site. Eyes followed the model to look up in wonder at the original mural, painted by Mr. Zallinger over a five-year period from 1942 to 1947, unveiling a span of earth history covering 300 million years.</p>
        <p>''I think it's a way to do something different -- to take these big old oil storage tanks and use them in a fun way -- highlighted with a grand scale collection of old dinosaur bones as displayed at the Peabody,'' said  Mayor John DeStefano Jr. of the City of New Haven. ''It speaks to people's pride and creativity, and is representative of New Haven's emerging sense of strength in its display and performing arts.''</p>
