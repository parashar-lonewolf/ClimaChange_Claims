        <p>LEAD: Fifteen years ago more than 60,000 people worked in the coal mines and the steel, glass, pottery and paper plants that lined the banks of the Ohio River just south of Wheeling, W.Va. Today fewer than 30,000 are employed there.</p>
        <p>Fifteen years ago more than 60,000 people worked in the coal mines and the steel, glass, pottery and paper plants that lined the banks of the Ohio River just south of Wheeling, W.Va. Today fewer than 30,000 are employed there.</p>
        <p>In many of the valley's cities and towns, the once-booming plants are rusting testaments to the decline of America's industrial base. ''For Sale'' signs sprout everywhere, unemployment rates of 15 to 20 percent are commonplace and welfare officials say one of every five families lives in poverty.</p>
        <p>And things may get worse, particularly for the region's miners. The clean air bill making its way through Congress includes a provision to reduce acid rain, one of the environmental fallouts that results when utility plants burn the high-sulfur coal mined here. The coal-burning plants, most of them in the Midwest, could install smokestack devices to remove the sulfur, or they could take a less costly approach and import low-sulfur coal. #4,000 Jobs Are on the Line ''Everybody knows they'll go for the cheapest approach and that means high-sulfur miners are in for some more hard times,'' said Larry Ward, the top local official of the United Mine Workers of America. ''The Congress doesn't seem to care that this bill has its own special kind of fallout and that we're going to be the victims.</p>
        <p>''It's a bill that's going to put 4,000 men out of work around here and probably another 10,000 or so miners elsewhere in the Midwest. And for every miner that goes, some grocer or car dealer or clothier is going to hurt, too.''</p>
        <p>The miners who work the rich seam of high-sulfur coal that runs beneath the Ohio Valley are already among the workers hardest hit in the area. In the last 15 years, their ranks have been thinned from a high of 16,000 in the mid-1970's to 4,000 by automation and the use of alternative fuels. The miners say they do not oppose reducing acid rain or air pollution.</p>
        <p>''Nobody has ever fought harder for clean air than us miners because we have to work where air is so dirty,'' said Ray Wright, a train motorman in the mine. ''All we ask in this new bill is fairness. There's technology out there that can make burning high-sulfur coal safe, but Congress doesn't seen to want to take the time to develop it.''</p>
        <p>An Issue With Names on It</p>
        <p>Local coal mine operators take a similar view. Robert Murray, the president of the Ohio Valley Coal Company, traveled to Washington on Wednesday to urge Congress to modify its clean air approach.</p>
        <p>''The acid rain issue, which started out as an environmental issue, is really a human issue,'' he told one Capitol Hill hearing. ''To me, there are names on this issue.''</p>
        <p>Senator Robert C. Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat who was once a coal miner, failed on Thursday to persuade the Senate to amend the clean air bill to offer additional unemployment benefits and retraining programs for miners thrown out of work. He pleaded with legislators to ''hear the cries of the people'' while considering the measure, which is expected to come up for a final Senate vote next week and then go on to passage by the House.</p>
        <p>But the Byrd amendment was defeated by a vote of 50 to 49. Opponents of the amendment said it was too costly and gave miners more than other workers who would be affected by the bill.</p>
        <p>Miners here, while appreciative of Mr. Byrd's effort, say that unemployment benefits and retraining programs would not tide them over because there is no hope of finding new work in the Ohio Valley these days.</p>
        <p>''Retrain me for what?'' asked Roger Stillion, a miner at Powhatan Point. ''Most miners are in their 40's and 50's because no new miners have come in for years.''</p>
        <p>Struggling to Stay Put</p>
        <p>Young people now grow assuming that they will move away when they finish high school, or maybe sooner if their parents can find work elsewhere. Valley residents speak sadly of an economic diaspora that is scattering families to the winds, with some coming together only for funerals.</p>
        <p>Most towns and villages are dotted with an unusually large number of small gas stations and little stores that sell sandwiches, the owners desperately struggling to find the money to stay put in the place they were born and raised and will always call ''home.''</p>
        <p>''There just isn't anything for a young person to do around here,'' said Jim McGee, a retired miner who opened a fast-food restaurant at Powhatan Point to supplement his retirement income.</p>
        <p>''And if the mines go, there won't be anything for the rest of us,'' he said. ''A hundred coal trucks go past my place every day. I get business from the drivers and, of course, so do any number of other merchants. If those trucks disappear, what then? More boarded up stores. More homes for sale. There'll be a domino effect.'' In the opinion of John Laslo, the former Mayor of Martins Ferry, who is a member of many valley economic commissions, the domino effect has been at work for some time, touching even the valley's vaunted athletic teams.</p>
        <p>''This valley was home for Lou Groza and John Havlicek and the Niekro boys and on and on in professional sports,'' he said. ''Knute Rockne and Woody Hayes and a lot of other coaches used to recruit here. ''Well, I've got to say it. With the loss of so many of our families and young people, our teams aren't what they used to be.''</p>
