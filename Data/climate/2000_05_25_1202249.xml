        <p>China Trade Bill Passes By Wide Margin in House  Lawmakers voted, 237 to 197, to give China permanent normal trading privileges. A Republican majority that was larger than expected made good on President Clinton's top remaining legislative priority; three out of four Republicans voted in favor of the measure, while two out of three Democrats voted against it. The vote virtually assures the end of the annual review of China's trade status, a ritual for 20 years that Beijing considers humiliating but opponents say maintains leverage over improving human rights.</p>

        <p>Governor Signs Into Law 2 Environmental Initiatives  Governor Pataki signed legislation banning the use of a common gasoline additive, M.T.B.E., that has polluted underground water supplies. He also signed a bill to limit the amount of pollutants that drift into New York from coal-burning power plants in the Midwest and South, causing acid rain. But the laws potentially place New York at odds with provisions of the Federal Clean Air Act of 1990, and energy and oil companies say they may sue.</p>
