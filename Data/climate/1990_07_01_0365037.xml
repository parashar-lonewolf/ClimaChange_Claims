        <p>LEAD: Ridding the environment of chlorine-based chemicals is necessary to save the atmosphere's protective ozone, experts say. But the price may include greater electricity consumption, costlier and less reliable refrigeration and automotive products, and increasing public exposure to toxic substances and explosives.</p>
        <p>Ridding the environment of chlorine-based chemicals is necessary to save the atmosphere's protective ozone, experts say. But the price may include greater electricity consumption, costlier and less reliable refrigeration and automotive products, and increasing public exposure to toxic substances and explosives.</p>
        <p>Environment ministers from 93 nations agreed at a landmark meeting on Friday to phase out the production and use of chlorofluorocarbons and several other chlorine and bromine-based chemicals by the end of the century. The accord greatly strengthened the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, and created a new fund to help poor nations change their technology to one based on chlorine-free compounds.</p>
        <p>But none of the replacements already in use or under development can duplicate all the useful properties of the class of compounds now banned.</p>
        <p>A study conducted recently by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory concluded that the lower efficiency of chlorofluorocarbon substitutes may increase electricity consumption in the United States by up to 94 billion kilowatt hours a year, about 3 percent electricity more than used now.</p>
        <p>Once Hailed as Wonders</p>
        <p>The chlorofluorocarbons now branded as threats were once hailed as wonder chemicals. Among other useful characteristics, they are stable, nontoxic and cannot catch fire. Their advent made possible new refrigerators, insulators, propellants and a host of other products and technologies that reshaped the way people live. As solvents, they became indispensible to the electronics industry, particularly in the cleaning of silicon chips. Substitute solvents have already been developed, but they have disadvantages, including high cost.</p>
        <p>Scientists agree that because of the fundamental laws of chemistry, no substitutes will ever be developed that offer all the qualities incorporated in chlorofluorocarbons.</p>
        <p>''From an applications standpoint, CFC's really are the best possible refrigerants,'' Powell Joyner, a research spokesman for the Electric Power Research Institute, said in an institute report. ''Whatever is used or developed as a replacement is likely not going to be quite as good.''</p>
        <p>The problem with the chemicals is that from an environmental standpoint they are too good. Their molecules are assembled using the strongest chemical bonds permitted by nature - bonds so strong they are almost impervious to breakage. Released in the air, a chlorofluorocarbon molecule can survive for up to a century, giving it ample time to drift intact into the stratosphere. Once at high altitude, however, the chemicals are exposed to the same intense ultraviolet radiation that has begun to leak through the ozone layer. This radiation breaks apart even the sturdy chemicals, releasing free chlorine, which in turn destroys ozone.</p>
        <p>Substitution of Hydrogen</p>
        <p>A class of chemicals already partly used as substitutes and that will be produced in enormous amounts as a result of the new ban are HCFC's -compounds that substitute hydrogen atoms for one or more of the chlorine atoms. This substitution weakens chemical bonds and makes the new chemicals degradable in the lower atmosphere, reducing chances of their reaching the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>But the new chemicals are not as versatile or efficient as chlorofluorocarbons, and they are far from completely benign with respect to the ozone layer. In fact, the accord approved on Friday included a resolution urging all nations to phase out even transitional chemicals by the year 2040 or sooner.</p>
        <p>One possible alternative refrigerant gas is propane, but this has a drawback: it is explosive.</p>
        <p>Chemists regard the search for degradable chlorofluorocarbons as analogous to the quest for degradable plastics: the thrust of environmentally oriented research reverses the earlier goal of making products stronger and more durable.</p>
        <p>''But we don't seem to have a choice,'' an industrial chemist said yesterday. ''It seems that for the sake of the planet's health, we're going to have throw certain forms of technological research into reverse.''</p>
