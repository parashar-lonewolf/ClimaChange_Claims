        <p>LEAD: Clearing some last-minute hurdles, negotiators from major industrial countries reached agreement tonight on a protocol to limit and eventually roll back global consumption of chemicals that are destroying the earth's protective ozone layer.</p>
        <p>Clearing some last-minute hurdles, negotiators from major industrial countries reached agreement tonight on a protocol to limit and eventually roll back global consumption of chemicals that are destroying the earth's protective ozone layer.</p>
        <p>The agreement must still be voted on Wednesday by the nations taking part in the meeting here, now numbering 46. It then must be ratified by countries representing at least 66 percent of global consumption of the chemicals, chlorofluorocarbons and halons.</p>
        <p>The United States had originally insisted that countries representing at least 90 percent of world production sign the treaty before it became binding. But it agreed to a lower number when all of the other delegations here opposed that position.</p>
        <p>Lee M. Thomas, the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency and head of the United States delegation, hailed the protocol as an international instrument that would set a precedent for dealing with global environmental concerns. Destroying the Ozone Shield</p>
        <p>Chlorofluorocarbons are used to manufacture refrigerants, solvents, plastic foams and for a wide variety of other purposes. Halons are used as fire suppressants. Both classes of chemicals have been found to combine with and destroy ozone in the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Ozone serves as a shield protecting the earth's surface from harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun. As the ozone shield deteriorates, increasing ultraviolet radiation is expected to lead to more skin cancer, eye disease and neurological damage in humans, as well as damage to crops, forests and aquatic life.</p>
        <p>The protocol would freeze all consumption of chlorofluorocarbons at levels prevailing in 1986. The freeze would take effect by Jan. 1, 1990. An exception was allowed for the Soviet Union, which would be permitted to freeze at levels prevailing in 1990, when its five-year plan expires.</p>
        <p>Chlorofluorocarbon consumption would then be rolled back by 20 percent by 1994 and an additional 30 percent by 1999. But global production of the chemicals would be permitted to rise as much as 10 percent over 10 years in order to meet the needs of developing countries for industrial growth. European Community a Hurdle</p>
        <p>Halon consumption levels would be frozen by 1994, but no rollbacks are planned for these chemicals yet.</p>
        <p>The major last-minute hurdle faced by the negotiators was a demand by the European Community that its 12 member nations be treated as a single entity and that consumption limits not apply to any one member country.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thomas said the United States objected to this plan because it would give the European Community a trade advantage not enjoyed by others joining in the protocol. A compromise was reached that would allow the Community to be treated individually, but only after each member state ratified the protocol individually.</p>
