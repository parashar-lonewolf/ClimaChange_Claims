        <p>The threat of global warming raises two salient questions: What's the economic cost of inaction? And what's the cost of action -- taking steps to stop further warming?</p>
        <p>The models for studying these questions are primitive, yielding little more than educated guesses. In the face of such numbing uncertainty, the sensible course is a policy of "no regrets." The U.S. would take measures -- including a tax on carbon-based fuels -- to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases as part of an overall strategy to reduce pollution to desirable levels.</p>
        <p>Reducing pollution makes sense whether or not global warming occurs. And at the end of the decade, with the benefit of more information and new technologies, the U.S. could decide whether more aggressive actions were warranted.</p>
        <p>If global temperatures rise 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit by late next century, as expected, the cost to the U.S., mainly in lower agriculture yields, would probably be 1 to 2 percent of total output, or less than $120 billion.</p>
        <p>This large, though not staggering, number would almost certainly balloon over time. And countries less geographically fortunate could suffer losses many times those of the U.S.</p>
        <p>Estimates of the costs of countering greenhouse emissions vary widely. Studies based solely on technological fixes say the cost is negligible. But the conclusions are unconvincing because the studies overlook the problem of putting new technologies to use.</p>
        <p>Economic models tell a grimmer story. Lowering emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels -- by, for example, switching to cleaner but more expensive fuels -- might cost the U.S. between $120 billion and $300 billion.</p>
        <p>But the true cost of stabilizing global emissions will be substantially higher because the West will have to cut emissions by far more than 20 percent. Otherwise poor countries like China and India will have too little room to grow. Rather than assaulting global warming, many countries might decide to spend the money instead on more pressing problems like feeding the hungry.</p>
        <p>The prudent course for the West is to impose taxes that help the environment, and incidentally combat global warming. The best choice would be a modest tax on carbon-based fuels.</p>
        <p>A carbon tax equivalent to, say, 25 cents per gallon of gasoline would help reduce pollution. Incidentally, it might be enough to help cut back greenhouse emissions in the West to 1990 levels by 2000 -- the policy environmentalists fought, unsuccessfully, to have adopted at next month's Earth Summit in Brazil. The problem with pledging to hit that target is that a modest tax might not be enough, requiring the West to renege or impose cripplingly higher taxes.</p>
        <p>That's why the U.S. is better off committing itself to a fixed tax than a fixed timetable for emissions. A carbon tax would help the environment but, by letting the timetable slip if necessary, risk doing little harm.</p>
        <p>A carbon tax would show U.S. resolve -- the bite that George Bush's no-regrets policy now lacks.</p>
