        <p>AS with breweries the world over, the first thing you notice at the Blue Point Brewing Company here is the smell. It's the rich, almost cloyingly sweet aroma of malted barley soaking in hot water, greeting you at the front door of the modest prefabricated building of corrugated metal and inviting you in. It's a smell that exerts a pull on beer lovers everywhere.</p>
        <p>But you won't smell it anywhere else on Long Island, short of little brew pubs or bathtub brewing operations. The Blue Point Brewing Company is the only commercial brewery on Long Island, open only two and a half years but already a survivor in a notoriously fragile business in which almost one of every four microbreweries goes under within five years of opening. In fact, while Long Island has had its share of short-lived restaurants and discos that have made their own beer as a sideline, Blue Point may be the first dedicated brewery on Long Island since the Linden Brewery in Lindenhurst closed in 1949.</p>

        <p>AS with breweries the world over, the first thing you notice at the Blue Point Brewing Company here is the smell. It's the rich, almost cloyingly sweet aroma of malted barley soaking in hot water, greeting you at the front door of the modest prefabricated building of corrugated metal and inviting you in. It's a smell that exerts a pull on beer lovers everywhere.</p>
        <p>But you won't smell it anywhere else on Long Island, short of little brew pubs or bathtub brewing operations. The Blue Point Brewing Company is the only commercial brewery on Long Island, open only two and a half years but already a survivor in a notoriously fragile business in which almost one of every four microbreweries goes under within five years of opening. In fact, while Long Island has had its share of short-lived restaurants and discos that have made their own beer as a sideline, Blue Point may be the first dedicated brewery on Long Island since the Linden Brewery in Lindenhurst closed in 1949.</p>
        <p>With other beverages, local production may not mean much, but with beer, freshness is almost everything, and few things ensure freshness so much as having a brewery right in the neighborhood. And few things inspire entrepreneurial risk-taking, especially among beer fanatics, as the quest for fresh beer.</p>
        <p>''We got every warning, we heard everything, but we couldn't get fresh beer,'' said Peter Cotter, 37, who owns Blue Point with Mark Burford, 38. ''That's what we're in this business for, because we're beer people. We're not businesspeople, we're not stockbrokers, we don't have a lot of money, our parents don't have a lot of money.''</p>
        <p>What's more, the work is hard, demanding endless hours in the brewery's wet, steamy environment, a factor that many would-be beer barons fail to consider, said David Edgar, the director of the Institute for Brewing Studies in Boulder, Colo., part of the Association of Brewers, a trade group. ''It means a lot of working through Thanksgiving, broken marriages and other ancillary miseries,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burford, who handles the bulk of the brewing, learned firsthand about the fragility of the brewing business. He worked at the Cobblestone Brewery and Winery in Huntington, which is now out of business, and at the Long Island Brewing Company in Jericho, also defunct, before joining forces with Mr. Cotter, who handles sales and marketing.</p>
        <p>''In the early to mid-90's, a lot of people thought beer was going to be easy money,'' Mr. Burford said. ''But you have to be a beer person to do it, and a lot of those people who were in the business for the wrong reasons are now out of it.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Burford and Mr. Cotter, being beer people means spending 60 to 70 hours a week in their brewery, which with its bits and pieces of third-hand furniture, its beer kegs stacked haphazardly on a wet cement floor and its piles of equipment with myriad hoses, valves and pipes, has all the charm of a gas station, though it does smell much better.</p>
        <p>Everywhere there is moisture, as beer in its varying stages of production moves from vat to kettle to tank, accompanied by a full range of pouring, bubbling and steaming noises. Blue Point's staff of three full-time and three part-time employees, wearing rubber boots and jackets, spray, mop and hose down surfaces. In one corner, a sinister white foam overflows a bucket like bubble bath intent on escape.</p>
        <p>''Oh, that's just a sterilizer collecting yeast from exiting carbon dioxide,'' Mr. Burford explained.</p>
        <p>Blue Point currently brews about 10,000 barrels of beer a year, a minuscule amount that may be about what Budweiser loses down the drain in a day. Still, it is enough to supply kegs to Long Island bars and restaurants devoted to good beer. A small amount is bottled, and six-packs are now available at Waldbaum's and King Kullen supermarkets on Long Island. A small fraction of the business comes from customers who visit the brewery and take home jugs filled directly from a tap.</p>
        <p>Blue Point generally produces five or six different beers in traditional styles, which change seasonally, along with its signature beer, Toasted Lager, a copper-colored, mildly bitter brew available year round. Right now, the other brews in the lineup are a light, crisp Pilsener; an excellent pale ale made enticingly bitter with plenty of hops; a chewy, almost chocolate-flavored oatmeal stout; and a robust amber winter ale. The most apparent quality of each of these brews is the lively, energetic flavors that are the unmistakable sign of fresh beer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burford, who grew up in West Sayville, and Mr. Cotter, who grew up in Oakdale and Holbrook, met in the late 1970's, a grim time for American beer lovers, who either had to settle for pallid, mass-produced American brews or hope against hope that imported beers would survive their journey through overheated container ships and warehouses with their flavor intact. They each independently discovered Mr. Fadeley's Deli-Pub, which still exists on Montauk Highway in Patchogue, serving the sort of dark German beers that were available almost nowhere else. It provided inspiration to the two beer lovers.</p>
        <p>''When people drink this kind of beer,'' Mr. Cotter said, ''they never go back to drinking less-good beer.''</p>
        <p>Setting themselves the goal of making the kinds of beers they liked,  and inspired by the success of microbreweries like Anchor in San Francisco, they set themselves on the path toward owning their own brewery, not an easy path by any means, considering that even after the expense of building a brewery, they still needed to navigate an arduous licensing process before they could go into production. Even finding a building to house the brewery was difficult, because of the height of the tanks.</p>
        <p>''A building that's good for a brewery is rare,'' Mr. Burford said. ''We looked at a lot of places. You need high ceilings, which is something that is not popular in this part of Long Island, and you need a resilient landlord.''</p>
        <p>Finally, they found an abandoned ice factory, which not only had the requisite high ceilings and understanding landlord but also was an environment built to withstand moisture. They got a loan from the Small Business Administration, and the landlord gave them a year's free rent, a necessity since they needed their cash to buy equipment and to live on during the drawn-out licensing process.</p>
        <p>''You can't brew until you get your license, but you can't get your license until you assemble your equipment, and you have to have a license before you get the loan,'' Mr. Cotter said. ''It took a year and a half. They couldn't have made it harder on us.''</p>
        <p>With the loan, their own money and a little help from friends and family, they were able to raise about $650,000, just enough to finance the project.</p>
        <p>''You wouldn't want to do it for any less,'' Mr. Burford said. ''We had a lot of breaks go our way.''</p>
        <p>To help make ends meet, they took odd jobs part time and worked on the brewery whenever they could, doing virtually all the construction themselves. Unlike some microbreweries, which begin life with enough capital to have their equipment custom-made, Blue Point had to scavenge for its equipment, gathering fermenting tanks, mash tuns and other vats at auction from breweries that had either gone out of business or were consolidating. Its direct-flame, brick-covered 15-barrel brew kettle was used previously by Wild Goose in Maryland. They dismantled it brick by brick, shipped it to Patchogue and reconstructed it themselves.</p>
        <p>''We didn't know what we were doing,'' Mr. Cotter said.</p>
        <p>But they did know how to make beer, and once they rolled out their first kegs in November 1998, they began the difficult task of fighting for space on the draft lists at Long Island bars and restaurants, a heated, never-ending battle in which tap handles --indicating that your beer is on tap -- are the holy grails.</p>
        <p>''The tap handles, that's territory, that's real estate,'' Mr. Cotter said. In order for Blue Point to be available, the bars had to remove another, usually well-established beer, not an easy thing since people often select brands by habit and since many other beers were supported by well-endowed breweries and distributors. ''They took off Bass Ale, they took off Sam Adams,'' Mr. Cotter said. ''These local restaurants, God bless them, they'd never heard of a local brewery, but they took it.''</p>
        <p>Blue Point is now available at some 150 bars and restaurants, Mr. Cotter said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burford, who is married (he and his wife are expecting a baby), and Mr. Cotter, who is single, know the business is hard. Their strategy, unlike that of so many microbreweries that expanded themselves into oblivion, is to grow slowly and cautiously, bar by bar, restaurant by restaurant. They have resisted the allure of moving into New York City, though their beer is available in a couple of Manhattan bars, which requested it. Mr. Cotter says that while Blue Point would like to have more beers available in six-packs, beyond the Toasted Lager, above all they want to sell draft beer, which tastes better, at least in theory, because it requires less filtering.</p>
        <p>''There are many more places to go on Long Island,'' he said. ''We're not on tap in anyplace on the Gold Coast, because we haven't ventured there.''</p>
        <p>So far, they're making a living doing what they love, and they believe that their customers appreciate what they are trying to do, Mr. Burford said.</p>
        <p>''We look at the customers who come in here to the tasting room,'' he said. ''We get teachers, railroad workers and skilled craftsmen, people who take time to appreciate something or who produce something themselves, who know what it takes.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Cotter, confidence comes from knowing that Blue Point is a beer that he wants to drink himself. ''We have something different, it's fresh, it's unpasteurized,'' he said with evangelical fervor. ''It doesn't matter what Wall Street says, it's the quality, that's the whole thing. We just know that. It doesn't matter what statistics tell us; we don't care.''</p>
        <p>If You Go . . .</p>
        <p>The Blue Point Brewing Company is at 161 River Avenue in Patchogue, a block south of the Long Island Rail Road tracks.</p>
        <p>Hours for brewery tours and for the tasting room are 3 to 7 p.m. Thursday and Friday and noon to 7 p.m. Saturday. Tours and tastes are free. Half-gallon jugs ($8) of all brews and six-packs ($7) of Toasted Lager are available.</p>
