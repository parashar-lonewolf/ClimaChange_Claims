        <p>After a wild night at a rave Gabriel (Tom McClane), a banker with a guilty conscience, makes his move on a pretty artist, Ellen (Sophie Hunter). He flirts and she smiles, and as the sexual tension rises conversation turns to -- what else? -- global warming. ''The sea's been rising by the same amount for centuries, but now with the ice caps melting, it's out of control,'' Ellen says, with a glint in her eye. After some passionate banter about storm surges and low-pressure systems, the attractive couple, high from all this talk of the end of the world, jump into the sack.</p>
        <p>Benjamin Davis's debut, ''Silverland'' -- an environmentally, if not dramatically, aware, play in the Brits Off Broadway festival -- is one of the first dramas I've seen that could be called green theater. Set in a nightmarish version of the near future, in a London wracked by drought and high temperatures, it portrays a hackneyed group of young people. Stockers (Tim Steed, who delivers a fast-talking Mametian performance) is a soulless banker who, in another era, would be twirling his mustache while cackling. His plan is to buy up the water on a moon of Jupiter in an attempt to exploit environmental disaster for profit.</p>

        <p>Benjamin Davis's debut, ''Silverland'' -- an environmentally, if not dramatically, aware, play in the Brits Off Broadway festival -- is one of the first dramas I've seen that could be called green theater. Set in a nightmarish version of the near future, in a London wracked by drought and high temperatures, it portrays a hackneyed group of young people. Stockers (Tim Steed, who delivers a fast-talking Mametian performance) is a soulless banker who, in another era, would be twirling his mustache while cackling. His plan is to buy up the water on a moon of Jupiter in an attempt to exploit environmental disaster for profit.</p>
        <p>Dario and Mikey, played with gusto by Cary Crankson and Bradley Taylor, are Bill and Ted with British accents. They take a few pills and forget the whole world. Dario, representing our inability to recognize the looming disaster, rhapsodizes: ''It's all about the now. Finding the now. And never letting go.'' Working off that same dreamy vibe is the ethereal goddess Cleo (Ony Uhiara) who occasionally shows up wearing tights and yellow beads. In between funky dance moves, she talks about her son Noah (of ark fame) and how she built the Sphinx and the Pyramids.</p>
        <p>''Silverland'' is what the musical ''Urinetown'' was making fun of: an agit-prop dream about business taking advantage of a water shortage. Officer Lockstock, the narrator of ''Urinetown,'' could be describing either setting when he called it a mythical place, a bad place, then said, ''Let's just say it's filled with symbolism and things like that.''</p>
        <p>''Silverland'' is at the 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, through June 3; (212) 279-4200.</p>
