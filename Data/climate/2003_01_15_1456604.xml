        <p>An ambitious project to extract oil from tar sands at Fort Hills in northern Alberta has been shelved, a Canadian unit of Koch Industries of Kansas said today.</p>
        <p>The $2.2 billion project was among a spate of oil sands developments in western Canada. Alberta's oil sands have recoverable reserves 40 times the size of the estimated reserves of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, and the region has been seen as a way for the United States to reduce its dependence on overseas oil.</p>
        <p>Although oil has been produced from tar sands in Canada for more than three decades, companies have barely scratched the surface, extracting less than 1 percent of reserves.</p>
        <p>Production from existing oil sands operations is expected to reach about one million barrels a day this year, almost equaling western Canada's conventional oil output.</p>
        <p>The Fort Hills project, 78 percent owned by Koch Industries and 22 percent by the UTS Energy Corporation of Calgary, Alberta, was at an advanced planning stage, with production due to start in 2005. Full production of 190,000 barrels a day was scheduled for 2008.</p>
        <p>David Park, the president and chief executive of the Koch unit, TrueNorth Energy, said in a telephone interview today that while ''the oil sands will play a very large role in North American oil security, I haven't seen anyone willing to pay for it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Park said that Koch wanted to reduce its interest in the project to less than 50 percent, but had been unable to find a partner among global energy and mining companies with the necessary financial and technical muscle.</p>
        <p>Mr. Park said that apart from initial capital expenses, the cost of extracting oil from tar sands was about 7 Canadian dollars ($4.54) a barrel, making the output a ''marginal, high-cost barrel.'' TrueNorth also cited the costs of complying with the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, recently ratified by Canada.</p>
        <p>Pierre Alvarez, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers in Calgary, said that TrueNorth's decision ''does highlight the challenge of Canadian projects in a global sense.'' The Canadian oil industry has been among the most vocal opponents of the Kyoto pact, and is presently lobbying the federal government for tax reductions.</p>
        <p>But John Mawdsley, an analyst with FirstEnergy Capital in Calgary, said that potential investors in TrueNorth might have been put off by the opportunity to participate only in the bitumen recovery portion of the project. The bitumen -- a form of heavy oil -- would have been upgraded at a refinery owned by Koch in Minnesota, near St. Paul.</p>
        <p>The decision to shelve the TrueNorth project does not ''say anything negative about the oil sands business,'' Mr. Mawdsley said.</p>
        <p>Last week, TotalFinaElf, the French oil giant, agreed to buy a 43.5 percent interest in another oil sands property, known as Surmont, in the Athabasca region of northern Alberta.</p>
        <p>Two American energy groups, ConocoPhillips and Devon Energy, own the remaining shares in Surmont. A decision whether to go ahead with construction of an extraction plant is expected later this year.</p>
        <p>Jean-Luc Guiziou, president of TotalFinaElf's Canadian unit, told The National Post last week that ''we have recognized the potential of those oil sands and we want to be part of the development of those resources.''</p>
        <p>Syncrude Canada, the world's largest oil sands producer which is owned by nine American and Canadian energy groups, is about midway through a $5 billion expansion that will double its production to about 465,000 barrels a day by 2007.</p>
        <p>The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers estimates that investment in the oil sands sector this year will total about 5 billion Canadian dollars, compared with 15 billion dollars for development of conventional oil wells.</p>
