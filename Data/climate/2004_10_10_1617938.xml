        <p>A''PERFECT STORM'' of sustained high water temperatures, low levels of dissolved oxygen and the toxic impact of ammonia and sulfides created lethal conditions for lobsters in western Long Island Sound in September 1999 and all but certainly explains why they suddenly died in huge numbers, researchers said last week.</p>
        <p>But in a series of reports delivered at a symposium on Monday at Stony Brook University, they sounded less certain about whether and to what degree pesticides contributed and said it was an area that needed more study.</p>
        <p>The 1999 die-off, which lobstermen said occurred with shocking speed between Sept. 19 and 22, abruptly ended a peak period for catches, essentially wiped out the $100 million lobster industry, idled hundreds of New York and Connecticut lobstermen who had been hauling a record 500,000 traps, and sounded alarms as far north as Maine.</p>
        <p>Shell disease, marked by eroded and discolored shells that make lobsters unmarketable, has also spread in eastern Long Island Sound, where lobsters are less plentiful. But the impact of the 1999 die-off was greatest in western waters of the Sound, where the lobsters and the lobster industry were concentrated. Last year, the lobster catch was less than one-tenth of its peak of 8.2 million pounds in 1997.</p>
        <p>Participants in the symposium described the die-off as a major environmental event, and in the view of some researchers, it was an ominous if still tentative sign of global warming. Long Island Sound is at the southern edge of the Maine lobster's East Coast range.</p>
        <p>''Global warming is definitely happening, and it's happening in Long Island Sound,'' said Karen Chytalo, a marine habitat protection official for the State Department of Environmental Conservation. But Jack Mattice, director of the New York Sea Grant program at Stony Brook, was more tentative, saying that anything that raised water temperatures was a threat to lobsters, and ''it could be global warming.''</p>
        <p>Long Island and Connecticut lobstermen who attended the symposium continue to suspect that lobsters were pushed over the edge by mosquito pesticides applied in communities around Long Island Sound to combat West Nile virus, which first appeared in the United States in 1999. Until that year, they said, lobsters had always rebounded once the late-summer conditions of high water temperatures and low dissolved oxygen ended.</p>
        <p>''I've seen plenty of warm water, but lobsters catch up,'' said Joseph Finke of Bayville, president of the Western Long Island Sound Lobstermen's Association. What had never happened before, he said, was that healthy lobsters gave way to ''nothing but death and destruction'' over just four days.</p>
        <p>But in reports delivered at the symposium, co-sponsored by the Connecticut and New York Sea Grant programs, researchers said that mosquito pesticides including methoprene, malathion, resmethrin and sumithrin could not account for the catastrophic 1999 die-off, even though the compounds were found to be extremely toxic to lobsters.</p>
        <p>The pesticides, in different combinations and at different times, were in use both before and after the die-off in New York City, on Long Island and in Westchester and Connecticut as government and health officials reacted to the onset of mosquito-borne West Nile virus with emergency ground and aerial spraying. Genetically, lobsters are closely related to mosquitoes.</p>
        <p>Many lobstermen believe the pivotal event came on Sept. 19, when the remnants of Hurricane Floyd, by then a tropical storm, dumped heavy rain on Long Island and flushed pesticides into the Sound in storm runoff.</p>
        <p>Gladstone N. Jones III, a lawyer in New Orleans representing more than 100 lobstermen from New York and Connecticut in a federal class-action suit against manufacturers of pesticides used around Long Island Sound in 1999, said there was powerful evidence that pesticides triggered the September 1999 die-off. He described lobsters as ''nothing but big mosquitoes'' that were highly sensitive to mosquito pesticides.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones said two pesticide manufacturers named in the suit had agreed to a settlement for an undisclosed amount, but reported in Newsday last Wednesday as $3.75 million. He said that Cheminova, the manufacturer of malathion, had declined to settle. A hearing is scheduled Dec. 10 before Judge Thomas C. Platt in Federal District Court in Central Islip.</p>
        <p>''The lobstermen are absolutely certain about what happened in September 1999,'' Mr. Jones said. ''It happened when Hurricane Floyd came through around Sept. 19, and suddenly hundreds of thousands of lobsters were pulled up dead in their traps. And this industry never recovered. It is essentially over.''</p>
        <p>But the researchers said that even assuming all the pesticides applied in counties around Long Island Sound at the time of the die-off had been washed into the water, the amounts were too small to kill lobsters or to weaken them enough that they would succumb to already hostile water conditions.</p>
        <p>Though Sea Grant officials billed the findings as definitive, they stopped short of exonerating the pesticides and said more research was needed. They also acknowledged that pesticide concentrations in Long Island Sound in the crucial September 1999 time frame were difficult to gauge.</p>
        <p>''It's really hard to go back and take measurements five years later,'' said Sylvain DeGuise, a researcher from the University of Connecticut who has studied the impact of pesticides on lobsters.</p>
        <p>Researchers were emphatic, however, in depicting what they concluded were the principal causes of the 1999 die-off. They also described the die-off as a more gradual event, foreshadowed in 1997 and 1998 when smaller die-offs were already signaling trouble ahead.</p>
        <p>By the time of the September 1999 die-off, they said, lobsters had already been exposed for more than two months to water temperatures above 68 degrees, considered the upper limit they can endure. As they withdrew from shallower, warmer waters to the cooler bottom waters, they were also subjected to low oxygen levels, or hypoxia.</p>
        <p>Researchers said that by late summer the lobsters, in moving away from hypoxic areas, crowded more closely together, only to be overtaken by hypoxia again. Hypoxia occurs as water grows warmer, and when algae and other marine organisms die, sink to the bottom, and consume oxygen on the bottom, already low in oxygen, as they decompose.</p>
        <p>Conditions grew even more hostile because there was too little oxygen for aerobic bacteria to continue this decomposition, leaving the job to anaerobic bacteria -- or bacteria that don't use oxygen -- which release ammonia and sulfides toxic to lobsters.</p>
        <p>The researchers said winds from a storm on Aug. 30 thoroughly mixed waters of Long Island Sound that had stratified during a dry summer, with warmer water near the surface.</p>
        <p>Carmela Cuomo, a marine ecologist and geologist at the University of New Haven, said the mixing brought fresh oxygen to the depths but also raised bottom water temperature by 1.5 to 2 degrees in just six hours, pushing it into the red zone for already weakened lobsters.</p>
        <p>Robert Wilson, an associate professor of marine sciences at Stony Brook University, said the increase in oxygen, in combination with high temperatures in the bottom waters, could also have contributed to a rise in toxicity linked to releases from heavy metals in the sediments.</p>
        <p>A tiny parasite, the paramoeba, which spread through the packed-together lobsters, emerged in the research as an opportunistic organism that overcame already weakened lobsters, but not as a cause of the die-off.</p>
        <p>Dr. Cuomo contended that even without the mixing event, the lobsters' long exposure to high water temperatures, low dissolved oxygen, ammonia and sulfides were enough to account for the 1999 die-off. She also warned that those conditions in Long Island Sound were far from rare. ''The probability of it happening again is very high,'' she said.</p>
        <p>She said periods of hypoxia, which generally occur in later summer and early fall and are most severe in western Long Island Sound, were now a persistent annual feature. ''It's year after year after year, and it's getting longer,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In one of several pointed exchanges between lobstermen and researchers at the symposium, Matthew De Maula, a lobsterman from Mattituck, questioned why only healthy lobsters, some from Maine, were used by researchers, when the effects of pesticides might be clearer in tests using Long Island Sound lobsters weakened by high temperatures and low oxygen. ''Why would you start with healthy animals?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>Dr. Cuomo replied that lobsters placed in waters simulating conditions on the bottom of Long Island Sound in 1999 would be dead before testing could begin.</p>
        <p>The future for the industry looks bleak. A graph of lobster larvae showed an up-and-down pattern leading to 2002, when levels fell to historic lows and stayed there. Penelope Howell-Heller, a senior fisheries biologist at the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, said it was the first time in 22 years of records that larvae levels had stayed so low for three consecutive years. Research also showed female lobsters were at low levels.</p>
        <p>The low numbers of larvae raised concerns about the use of mosquito pesticides on land because of the extraordinarily lethal effect even tiny amounts could have on the larvae and also on juvenile lobsters.</p>
        <p>Researchers reported that as little at 33 parts per billion of the pesticide malathion in Sound water would kill 50 percent of adult lobsters, with juveniles and larvae deemed even more susceptible. Malathion was used in New York City in August and September 1999. Suffolk sprayed malathion by air over parts of Huntington in late September 1999. Resmethrin, applied by truck in Nassau and Suffolk in the fall of 1999, was found to be nearly as toxic.</p>
        <p>Dr. Michael N. Horst of the Mercer University School of Medicine in Macon, Ga., said in a telephone interview that although methoprene was also toxic in low concentrations to lobster larvae and had been part of what he described as ''a cocktail of pesticides'' applied in New York City in 1999, amounts had apparently been too small to contribute to the lobster die-off.</p>
        <p>But he said the toxicity of the compound raised alarm. ''You would have to be an absolute fool to use methoprene near coastal waters,'' he said. Suffolk County uses methoprene annually as part of a mosquito control program targeting mosquito breeding areas, many of them in coastal wetlands.</p>
        <p>The Sea Grant programs in New York and Connecticut, the co-sponsors of the symposium, are part of a national Sea Grant network of 30 university programs under the auspices of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Sea Grant programs perform coastal research and seek to educate the public about coastal issues.</p>
        <p>In 2001 Congress allocated $6.6 million to N.O.A.A. to research the causes and economic impact of the 1999 lobster die-off and shell disease in Long Island Sound. Connecticut contributed an additional $1 million. The National Marine Fisheries Service and environmental agencies in both states participated.</p>
        <p>The relatively modest amount of money available for research left many questions unanswered and confined researchers to addressing relatively narrow issues. The researchers agreed that more research, data and monitoring were necessary, including research into the role of mosquito pesticides in weakening or killing lobsters.</p>
        <p>The lobster die-off followed the collapse of the clamming industry in South Shore bays in the 1970's, an event variously attributed to overfishing and pollution, and the decimation of scallops in the Peconic bays beginning in 1985, when the brown tide algae bloomed profusely and sickened the shellfish. The algal blooms, which have occurred periodically since 1985 in the Peconic and South Shore bays, are still a puzzle to researchers.</p>
