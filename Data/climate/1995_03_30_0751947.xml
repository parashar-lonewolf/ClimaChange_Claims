        <p>In a move that seems likely to reduce their leverage at a global conference, Administration officials conceded today that the United States was unlikely to meet President Clinton's goal of limiting emissions of heat-trapping gases to 1990 levels by the year 2000.</p>
        <p>The admission, though not a surprise, is expected to make it far harder for American officials at a global climate conference now under way in Berlin to persuade other countries to reduce output of gases like carbon dioxide, which trap heat in the atmosphere much the way glass traps heat in a greenhouse.</p>

        <p>In a move that seems likely to reduce their leverage at a global conference, Administration officials conceded today that the United States was unlikely to meet President Clinton's goal of limiting emissions of heat-trapping gases to 1990 levels by the year 2000.</p>
        <p>The admission, though not a surprise, is expected to make it far harder for American officials at a global climate conference now under way in Berlin to persuade other countries to reduce output of gases like carbon dioxide, which trap heat in the atmosphere much the way glass traps heat in a greenhouse.</p>
        <p>Convinced that emission of the so-called greenhouse gases is causing global warming, the Clinton Administration is trying to take the lead to get countries to make new and firmer pledges to cut such emissions well into the 21st century.</p>
        <p>In the 1992 presidential campaign and again in April 1993, Mr. Clinton pledged that the United States would meet the 2000 goal. In the campaign, he criticized President George Bush for rejecting that goal, set at the 1992 Earth Summit conference in Rio de Janeiro. At the time, Mr. Bush and others in his Administration said that limiting the gases, which result primarily from the burning of fossil fuels, would damage the American economy.</p>
        <p>Today, however, several Administration officials acknowledged that the United States was unlikely to meet Mr. Clinton's goal.</p>
        <p>"It's going to be very hard," said one White House official. "You could say the way things look now we may be a little short."</p>
        <p>At a recent news briefing, Timothy E. Wirth, the Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs and head of the American delegation to Berlin, said the United States would probably miss the goal by a wide margin.</p>
        <p>In an interview today, he was somewhat less pessimistic. Still, in previously discussing the most important heat-trapping gas, carbon dioxide, Mr. Wirth estimated that the United States would emit 30 million more tons of carbon in 2000 than it did in 1990.</p>
        <p>In 1990, the United States emitted 1.3 billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere. That level would rise to more than 1.4 billion tons by the year 2000 without energy conservation measures, Mr. Wirth said, but he predicted that energy conservation steps the Administration will put forward would limit the emissions to about 1.33 billion tons.</p>
        <p>The Administration has relied primarily on voluntary and cooperative measures, like providing technical assistance to companies to install more efficient lighting and heating systems. Energy efficiency is vital to reducing emissions because carbon dioxide is produced by burning coal, oil and natural gas, the fuels that make modern economies run.</p>
        <p>Environmental officials in the Administration say that emissions of heat-trapping gases have increased more rapidly than expected over the last three years and are almost 5 percent above 1990 levels. They cite several reasons: economic growth has been strong, fuel prices have been relatively low and the Administration was unable to win Congressional approval of an energy tax that was to be a cornerstone of the its efforts to reduce the use of fossil fuels. Administration officials say that tax would have cut carbon emissions by 25 million tons annually by the year 2000.</p>
        <p>Many environmentalists cite another reason for rising emissions -- that the Administration has not sought stricter fuel efficiency levels for automobiles for fear of alienating companies and consumers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wirth said today that Vice President Al Gore was overseeing development of further steps that would be announced in October to fulfill Mr. Clinton's commitment.</p>
