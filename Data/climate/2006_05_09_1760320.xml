        <p>On the walls of the Capitol Hill office of Representative Sherwood Boehlert are framed copies of laws he has helped shepherd through the legislative process -- the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990, the NASA Authorization Act of 2005, the Nanotechnology Act of 2003.</p>
        <p>In 24 years in Congress, Mr. Boehlert, a Republican from Utica, N.Y., who is chairman of the House Committee on Science, has been a strong advocate for science and the environment. As such, he has sometimes found himself at odds in Washington with the leadership of his own party.</p>
        <p>''This is a town,'' he said, ''where everyone says they are for science-based decision making -- until the science leads to a politically inconvenient conclusion. And then they want to go to Plan B.''</p>
        <p>In March, Mr. Boehlert announced he would not run again.</p>
        <p>Q. In all your years in Congress, can you recall a time when science issues were as politicized as they are today?</p>
        <p>A. Making science political is just a part of the current times. And I've never seen a time on Capitol Hill when there has been as much partisanship as there is right now. The tolerance level is at an all-time low.</p>
        <p>It's not just about science. But guess what: the good news is that people are finally talking about science. There didn't used to be many conversations about science. That's healthy.</p>
        <p>Q. Is partisanship part of the reason you will retire after this year?</p>
        <p>A. It's a combination of factors. I certainly don't like the fact that partisanship is more intensive than ever. But I thought long and hard about this. It's just time for me.</p>
        <p>I don't like, week after week, flying back and forth, sometimes getting up at 4 in the morning. I went through a triple bypass two years ago. I don't want to go on here forever. I don't want to be carried out on a stretcher or in a box. I'll be 70 in September. Even a Duracell battery wears down.</p>
        <p>Q. You're considered a moderate Republican. Does it sadden you that you're often described as one of the last of a breed?</p>
        <p>A. It makes me sad to think that people speculate that my kind of public official is an endangered species.</p>
        <p>When I was a kid at Utica College, my governor was Nelson Rockefeller and my senators were Kenneth Keating and Jacob Javits, all progressive Republicans. And they taught me very early that government was about improving the lot of others.</p>
        <p>I remember Nelson Rockefeller had a campaign poster: ''If fish could vote, they'd vote for Nelson Rockefeller.'' That was because he was so sensitive to the environment. And I've long felt that Republicans shouldn't cede the issue of the environment to the other party.</p>
        <p>Q. What would you say have been your most important legislative accomplishments?</p>
        <p>A. I'm proud of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, which helped launch the war on acid rain. That's on the plus side of the ledger. On the negative side, much of what we have accomplished has been damage prevention.</p>
        <p>In 1995, for instance, after Newt Gingrich became speaker, there was this feeling that there'd been too much government regulation. There were 17 ''riders from hell'' in the E.P.A. appropriations bill that, in one form or another, were going to damage existing environmental regulations. I led opposition to that. And we defeated all 17.</p>
        <p>Q. Your main legislative effort has been a measure to mandate an increase in fuel efficiency standards on new cars -- corporate average fuel economy standard, the so-called CAFE standards. That's never passed. Why?</p>
        <p>A. Well, we've tried, three times over six years. Each time, we get closer. Last October, when another energy bill came to the floor, I tried again by offering an amendment.</p>
        <p>I went to the Rules Committee, and the Republican leadership said: ''Look, you already had a vote on this in this Congress. What's changed?''</p>
        <p>I said, ''Hurricane Katrina and $3-a-gallon gasoline.'' They did not allow the House to consider my amendment because they took an unofficial count and discovered it might pass.</p>
        <p>For years, I've been trying to get the message out: we can do something about the gasoline supply by increasing fuel efficiency in cars.</p>
        <p>Q. You must have been astonished to hear recently that President Bush, in response to rising gas prices, is asking Congress for the authority to impose higher CAFE standards on passenger cars.</p>
        <p>A. Not at all.</p>
        <p>Hope springs eternal. You know, I've been in President Bush's company several times recently, and I've never missed the opportunity to bring up CAFE standards.</p>
        <p>Just last week, I met with Jim Connaughton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, and suggested that at the upcoming meeting between the president and the heads of the Big 3 auto companies, CAFE standards be an agenda item. He indicated it would be part of the discussion.</p>
        <p>Later, I received a copy of a letter from the secretary of transportation, Norman Mineta, to leaders in the House and Senate. It was somewhat ambiguous, but it suggested that we have to have CAFE standards. How the administration deals with it and how I might are likely to be different. But we're beginning to close the gap.</p>
        <p>Q. The president also made a renewed call for oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Why does that idea surface every time there's a fuel price rise?</p>
        <p>A. It's not a very good idea. You'd get more fuel savings sooner with my proposed increase in CAFE standards than you would get if you drilled in ANWR -- and that's if the most optimistic projections of economic recoverable oil from there are accurate.</p>
        <p>This keeps coming up because the Alaskan representatives in the House and Senate keep pushing it. They're influential.</p>
        <p>Every one of their constituents stands to benefit economically from that. If you live in Alaska, a family of four gets about $10,000 in oil royalties per year. If you drill in ANWR, they'll get more.</p>
        <p>Q. If your party maintains control of the House in November, your successor as chairman of the Committee on Science will most likely be Ralph Hall of Texas, described on his own Web site as ''an ardent supporter of legislation benefiting the oil and gas industry.'' How would his leadership differ from yours?</p>
        <p>A. He is the heir apparent because he is the most senior member -- and a highly respected member. But there's no guarantee that the most senior member will get it.</p>
        <p>You know, Ralph Hall has a great wit. He says that I've never seen a tree I didn't want to hug, and he's never seen a cemetery that he didn't want to drill in.</p>
        <p>We are dramatically different in many respects. But he is a supporter of federal investment in science.</p>
        <p>If he were to assume chairmanship of the Committee on Science, he'd be an advocate of more investment in science.</p>
        <p>Q. If you were writing a headline summarizing your career, how would it read?</p>
        <p>A. ''He cared, and he tried to make things better.'' I know, that's so corny.</p>
        <p>A CONVERSATION WITH/SHERWOOD BOEHLERT</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 20, 2006, Saturday  An article in Science Times on May 9 in the form of a conversation with Representative Sherwood Boehlert of New York, the departing chairman of the House Science Committee, included an incorrect figure from him for the annual payment from oil royalties that the State of Alaska awards to each citizen. In 2005, it was $845.76 per person, or $3,383 (not $10,000) for a family of four. (The highest payment, in 2000, was $1,963.86 per person.)</p>
