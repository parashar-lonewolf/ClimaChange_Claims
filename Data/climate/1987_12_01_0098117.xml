        <p>LEAD: New, legally binding restrictions on the use of chemicals now widely believed to be depleting the earth's ozone layer, which screens out harmful radiation from the sun, will be proposed Tuesday by the Federal Government.</p>
        <p>New, legally binding restrictions on the use of chemicals now widely believed to be depleting the earth's ozone layer, which screens out harmful radiation from the sun, will be proposed Tuesday by the Federal Government.</p>
        <p>The proposal, which will require industry first to freeze and then to roll back the production and consumption of two widely used chemicals, chlorofluorocarbons and halons, will be announced by the Environmental Protection Agency, officials said today.</p>
        <p>Industrial and developing nations agreed to control the use of the two chemicals at a meeting in Montreal in September. But the United States will be the first to take internal legal steps to carry out the agreement, the E.P.A. officials said.</p>
        <p>President Reagan has not yet submitted the Montreal Protocol to the Senate for ratification, but he is expected to do so by the end of the year. The agency is proposing the new rules now to fulfill terms of a settlement of a lawsuit filed by the Natural Resources Defense Counsel, a private environmental group. Environmentalists Are Critical</p>
        <p>Although the proposed regulations would be in compliance with the treaty, spokesmen for the environmental group criticized them as ''too little and too late.''</p>
        <p>Atmospheric ozone serves as a shield absorbing some of the ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Increases in that radiation resulting from a thinning of this ozone shield will cause increased skin cancer and other harm to humans as well as damage to crops and nature.</p>
        <p>Chlorofluorocarbons and halons are now widely believed by scientists to be reacting chemically with and destroying ozone molecules in the atmosphere, including over Antarctica, where a drastic seasonal thinning of ozone has been discovered.</p>
        <p>About 700 million pounds of chlorofluorocarbons are used each year in the United States alone for refrigerants, foam insulation, cleaning agents and other applications. Halons are used in fire suppressants.</p>
        <p>The rules proposed by the E.P.A. will go into force on the schedule agreed on in Montreal. This means a freeze on all chlorofluorocarbons at 1986 levels starting in 1989, a 20 percent rollback in their use by 1994 and a 50 percent rollback by 1999. The use of halons will be frozen at 1986 levels starting in 1994, with no rollback.</p>
        <p>The application of the United States rules would also be contingent on ratification of the protocol by countries representing two-thirds of global consumption of the chemicals.</p>
        <p>In the mid-1970's, use of chlorofluorocarbons in aerosol sprays was banned in this country, Canada and some Scandinavian countries. But other industrialized nations did not follow suit. The global use of these chemicals has grown rapidly. Quotas on Production and Use</p>
        <p>Under the proposed rules, which are being issued under the authority of the Clean Air Act, the E.P.A. would allocate quotas for the production and consumption of the chemicals to companies making and using them in 1986. The companies would be permitted to trade their allocated quotas. Export and import levels of the chemicals would also be controlled.</p>
        <p>Kevin J. Fay, executive director of the Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy, an industry group, said the freeze on the use of the chemicals was likely to double their price and the rollbacks could quadruple the price. He said this was likely to lead to increased recycling of the chemicals by industry and a more aggressive search for substitute compounds.</p>
        <p>David D. Doniger, a lawyer and air pollution expert for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the proposed cuts in production of the chemicals would only slow the ozone depletion. He cited an E.P.A. report that indicated a reduction of 85 percent from current levels would be needed just to keep chlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere at current levels.</p>
        <p>Measurements in recent months showing that ozone levels over Antarctica had reached their lowest level ever documented add to the urgency of curbing releases of chlorofluorocarbons, Mr. Doniger said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Fay of the industry association said that the implications of the hole in the ozone layer were still not fully understood by scientists and that it is ''nonsense to criticize'' the new E.P.A. rules at this point.</p>
