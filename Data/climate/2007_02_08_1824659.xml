        <p>The European Commission on Wednesday proposed binding rules that require automakers to cut carbon dioxide emissions for new cars, prompting criticism from European auto companies that said the rules went too far and environmentalists who said the regulations did not go far enough.</p>
        <p>Under the proposed rules, which would require approval from the European Union's member countries, carmakers would need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from new cars to an average 130 grams a kilometer by 2012.</p>
        <p>Currently, there are only voluntary reductions calling for 140 grams of carbon dioxide a kilometer by 2008. A previous proposal, which the European Union withdrew last week, set a target of 120 grams.</p>
        <p>European environmental officials said an additional 10 grams would be cut by a combination of steps, including encouraging greater use of biofuels, making tires more fuel efficient and creating better traffic management across the 27 member countries in the bloc.</p>
        <p>José Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, said the new rules could help rather than hinder Europe's ailing car industry.</p>
        <p>''The E.U. car industries are at the core of our economies,'' he said. ''By positively taking up the climate change challenge, they will preserve and enhance their competitiveness in the long term.''</p>
        <p>But the automobile industry, which lobbied furiously against the latest proposal, said mandatory rules would undermine European competitiveness, push companies to cut jobs in Europe and increase prices for new cars.</p>
        <p>Shares in Porsche, whose powerful models have the highest average carbon dioxide output among major car brands, fell 2 percent after the proposals were announced.</p>
        <p>The European Car Manufacturers Association, which represents 13 makers, including BMW, Volkswagen and Ford, said the new rules imposed an unfair burden on automakers.</p>
        <p>''Putting the burden mainly on the car industry is the most expensive and least cost-effective method possible,'' said Sergio Marchionne, chief executive of Fiat and president of the association. ''It will lead to a loss of jobs and the relocation of production outside the E.U.''</p>
        <p>But environmental groups and green-friendly political parties asserted that the European Commission had caved in to pressure from the automobile industry at a time when fighting climate change was more important than ever.</p>
        <p>Richard More O'Ferrall, spokesman for the Green group in the European Parliament, said the new rules were not strong enough to prevent car companies from producing gas-guzzling vehicles.</p>
        <p>''By scaling back its proposals on carbon dioxide emissions from cars,'' he said, ''the commission has once again confirmed that the bottom line of the German car industry takes priority over tackling climate change.''</p>
        <p>Transport and Environment, an environmental group in Brussels, added that the impact of the weakened target would be an additional 100 million tons of carbon in the atmosphere from 2012 to 2020, or the equivalent of twice the annual emissions of Sweden.</p>
        <p>The proposed mandatory caps follow the failure of automakers to meet voluntary targets set by the commission nine years ago.</p>
        <p>But the new rules are less ambitious than those initially envisioned by the union's environment commissioner, Stravros Dimas, who compromised under pressure from Germany that included Chancellor Angela Merkel's concern that the rules could unfairly penalize industry.</p>
        <p>The union's industry commissioner, Günter Verheugen of Germany, said Wednesday that he did not rule out having different caps for different sizes of cars -- for example, requiring gas-guzzling models to make larger emissions cuts than more fuel-efficient vehicles. But he emphasized that the commission had not discussed imposing penalties on carmakers that failed to comply.</p>
        <p>While the European Union proposal was greeted with skepticism in Germany, where powerful cars are popular, it renewed a German debate on whether to impose speed limits on the country's autobahn, where the absence of a limit has encouraged drivers to travel at high speeds.</p>
        <p>In a poll published Wednesday in Stern magazine, 60 percent of Germans said they favored limits on the autobahn network because of environmental concerns.</p>
        <p>The emissions proposal is part of a wider European drive to combat climate change to meet a pledge under the Kyoto Protocol to cut greenhouse gases by 8 percent below 1990 levels by 2012. Last week, the commission proposed legislation that would require oil companies to reduce greenhouse gases by 1 percent a year over a decade.</p>
