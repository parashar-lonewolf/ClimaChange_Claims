        <p>A Law Backfires, Leaving Romanian Orphans in Limbo  To protect children, Romania effectively banned international adoptions, which were popular with American and European applicants. The children may spend their lives in orphanages, like this one in Bucharest.</p>
        <p>PAGE A6</p>
        <p>U.A.W. Chief to Face G.M.  Ron Gettelfinger, the president of United Auto Workers, faces the fight of his union life as Rick Wagoner, General Motors' chief executive, presses him to accept major benefit cuts. The fight will have broad implications for the American autoworker and help determine whether the Big Three automakers can slash costs.</p>
        <p>BUSINESS DAY, PAGE C1</p>
        <p>Religion at Military Academy  An Air Force panel found that officers and faculty members at the Air Force Academy periodically used their positions to promote Christian beliefs and failed to accommodate the religious needs of non-Christian cadets. But it said it found no ''overt religious discrimination.''</p>
        <p>PAGE A12</p>
        <p>New Social Security Proposal  Influential Republicans offered a proposal that would use the cash surplus the Social Security system is running to finance private investment accounts.</p>
        <p>PAGE A13</p>
        <p>Mayor Wins on Trash Plan  After an earlier victory, the City Council abandoned its fight against Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's ambitious plan to ship New York City's garbage by barge. But the plan still faces significant hurdles.</p>
        <p>PAGE B1</p>
        <p>Global Warming Pioneer Dies  Dr. Charles D. Keeling, who set off current concerns over global warming through his ''Keeling curve'' measurements that, starting in the 1950's, showed a steady rise in the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, was 77.</p>
        <p>PAGE C20</p>
        <p>Gain for Morning-After Pill  Senators in Albany passed a bill to allow pharmacists and nurses to dispense the so-called morning-after pill, which can prevent pregnancy after sex, to women who do not have prescriptions.</p>
        <p>PAGE B1</p>
        <p>Little Data on Health Devices  Patients are receiving less information on products that are implanted in their bodies than on the safety and performance of their cars.</p>
        <p>BUSINESS DAY, PAGE C1</p>
        <p>Dressed to Fly  This travel season, savvy passengers have figured out how to pass through airport security checkpoints without incident. Chic this summer at the airport means no lace-up dress shoes, no belts and no heavy-metal jewelry.</p>
