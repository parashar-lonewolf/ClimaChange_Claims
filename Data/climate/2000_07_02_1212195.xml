        <p>IN a summer when electric supplies on Long Island will again be pushed to the limit by rising demand, questions are being raised whether Nassau County improperly spent $20 million granted by a state agency for energy conservation to help close its budget deficit.</p>
        <p>The $20 million was a one-time grant from the Long Island Power Authority, a state agency financed by Long Island electricity customers through their rate payments. It was added to a $620 million settlement of tax cases involving past overassessment in Suffolk County of the Shoreham nuclear power plant.</p>
        <p>In what amounted to a rider to the tax settlement, which was approved by the LIPA trustees in February, the authority said it was granting the $20 million from its Clean Energy Fund ''to be used by Nassau County for clean energy and conservation programs.''</p>
        <p>But Nassau officials confirmed last week that no such programs were paid for with the money, which they said had been used instead for deficit reduction.</p>
        <p>According to people close to the tax case negotiations, the $20 million grant had been demanded by the Nassau County executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, and by county legislators as a condition for agreeing to the overall settlement, which relieved Suffolk County of a court-ordered payment of more than $1.2 billion for the excess plant assessments. It also provided for $50 rebate checks to every LIPA customer in Nassau.</p>
        <p>An authority trustee, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that at the time of the trustees' vote, there had been an expectation that the $20 million would be used to reduce the county deficit, and not for energy conservation programs. ''I am sure it got sucked up in three seconds,'' the trustee said.</p>
        <p>But the counsel to the Suffolk County Legislature, Paul Sabatino, and the director of the Legislature's budget review office, Frederick B. Pollert, said they were astonished to learn recently that the $20 million had been spent not for conservation but for deficit reduction.</p>
        <p>''It is a serious matter to use ratepayer money for non-utility purposes,'' Mr. Sabatino said. ''LIPA is not supposed to be in the business of bailing out a mismanaged municipality. Money authorized for one specific, legitimate governmental purpose cannot be used for a totally different, unrelated purpose.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pollert said the $20 million grant should have been accompanied by an ironclad agreement that assured it was used for the stated purpose of conservation. ''The money should not be diverted,'' he said. ''That is contrary to government accountability.''</p>
        <p>Last week a spokeswoman for Mr. Gulotta, Wendy McQuair, confirmed that the $20 million had been received and ''appropriately placed in the county's general fund.''</p>
        <p>According to the county comptroller's office, the money actually went into five different county funds in the current budget: $15,288,000 to the general fund; $580,000 to the parks fund; $2,640,000 for the police department headquarters fund; $1,318,000 for the county community college fund, and $180,000 for the fire commission fund.</p>
        <p>Judith A. Jacobs, a Democrat of Woodbury and the presiding officer of the Nassau County Legislature, confirmed that the $20 million was used as ''part of a deficit reduction program for the year 2000.''</p>
        <p>''The power authority was a very big help to us at a time when the county really did need that shot in the arm,'' she said. ''And the bottom line is, if it wasn't for Richie Kessel,'' chairman of LIPA, ''and the board of trustees agreeing to this type of lump-sum payment, the county would not have agreed to the settlement'' of the Shoreham tax case.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jacobs said the $20 million had helped in addressing a budget crisis that erupted last November when the lame-duck Republican majority in the Legislature rescinded a 1 percent real estate transfer tax, leaving a $60 million budget hole.</p>
        <p>''It was a tremendous help to us,'' she said of the $20 million grant, a subject of negotiations well before the LIPA board approved it in February as part of the tax settlement. ''On the eve of Thanksgiving we were given this turkey, and then we got this gift from LIPA.</p>
        <p>''I would be lying if I didn't tell you that in our budget this was an integral part of deficit reduction.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kessel confirmed that the $20 million had been granted for energy conservation. But he said the authority could not control how the county spent the money.</p>
        <p>''We indicated we would like them to spend it on energy conservation,'' he said. But he added, ''The money was given to Nassau County as part of an overall settlement and I don't think LIPA is in a position to tell them what to do with this money.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kessel said use of the money to reduce a budget deficit ''does not in any way violate the agreement.''</p>
        <p>Last month Mr. Kessel was appointed by Governor Pataki to serve on the Nassau County Interim Finance Authority, a state authority whose chairman is Frank G. Zarb, a former LIPA chairman, that will oversee Nassau finances.</p>
        <p>The new authority will give the county $105 million in state aid over the next five years. In exchange, the county must reduce its budget by $52 million this year and $70 million in each of the next three years.</p>
        <p>This year's required cuts were agreed upon last month, and on Wednesday, Standard &amp; Poor's removed Nassau from its Creditwatch list while also downgrading county bonds to BBB-, its lowest grade above junk status. Ms. Jacobs said that being removed from Creditwatch was a victory for the county for which LIPA deserved some credit, by supplying the $20 million at a critical moment.</p>
        <p>But Gordian Raacke, executive director of the Citizens Advisory Panel, a LIPA watchdog, said use of the $20 million to fill a budget gap was both improper and short-sighted.</p>
        <p>''If LIPA had insisted that the $20 million be used on energy efficiency, Nassau County would have been able to reduce its electric bills for years to come, instead of having this one-time benefit,'' he said. ''And it's also something the credit-rating agencies would have liked.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Raacke said the fund from which the authority took the $20 million was intended for renewable energy like wind and solar power, and for energy conservation projects like installing energy-efficient light bulbs and air conditioning.</p>
        <p>He said such programs would reduce the need for more power generating stations on Long Island and increased imports of electricity.</p>
        <p>LIPA's trustees voted on June 22 to contract TransEnergie U.S., of Westborough, Mass., to build a $120 million cable under Long Island Sound to transport 300 megawatts of electricity from New England to Long Island.</p>
        <p>TransEnergie, a subsidiary of Hydro-Quebec, would complete the 26-mile cable by May 2002 from New Haven to the site of the now-defunct Shoreham nuclear plant. That plant was designed to generate 800 megawatts of power but never operated commercially. But the electrical station built to handle the plant's output will now be connected to the cable.</p>
        <p>The power authority said it would agree to purchase all the power carried by the cable, which would be built at TransEnergie's expense.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kessel said the cable ''will bring urgently needed power to Long Island'' without the delays of gaining approval for a new power generating station. He said current electric supplies of 5,140 megawatts were barely enough for a projected summer peak use more than 4,890 megawatts.</p>
        <p>James P. Nash, the cable project manager for TransEnergie, said the cable would be buried six feet below the sound bottom. ''We are looking forward to contributing to lower power costs on Long Island,'' he said.</p>
        <p>James S. Potter, the director of business development for PPL Global, of Fairfax, Va., a power generating company, said the cable would be ''one piece of a broader solution'' to ''a serious energy shortfall on Long Island.'' That company has proposed building a 600-megawatt plant in Kings Park.</p>
        <p>Proposed power projects for Long Island currently total more than 6,000 megawatts, including more than 1,500 megawatts of imported power.</p>
        <p>But the projects, advanced by various energy companies in competition with one another, would not be completed in time to meet projected energy shortages on Long Island and in the metropolitan region during the next two years.</p>
