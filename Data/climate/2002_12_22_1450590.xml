        <p>Q: President Bush took office two years ago. Give him a midterm grade.</p>
        <p>A minus/B plus. He rallied the country after 9/11. He has been clear-cut</p>
        <p>in his vision on the war on terrorism.</p>
        <p>He gets an A minus for the economy?</p>
        <p>On the economy I would give him a lower grade, probably a C.</p>
        <p>Did you support the president's firing of his economic team? And was it handled well?</p>
        <p>As far as Mr. O'Neill is concerned, it was handled in very rough fashion. This is a tough town. I appreciated Mr. O'Neill's candor. It's all too lacking around this town -- and in this administration. I did not know Mr. Lindsey at all, and perhaps that's a commentary on his effectiveness. Given the challenges we face with this economy, I think it's probably a good idea to bring in a new team.</p>
        <p>You write in your memoir, ''Worth the Fighting For,'' that to achieve your goals in politics, ''you need a swift, hard punch to break through the public's skepticism.'' What has been the hardest punch landed by either opponent in the campaign-finance fight?</p>
        <p>An effort to disparage my reputation. You see, if you can destroy McCain's integrity, then he has no credibility on the issue. That's been their strategy.</p>
        <p>Do you believe that there is an organized effort to silence you?</p>
        <p>I don't believe it's organized in that there's a cabal that spends its time in a conspiracy to destroy John McCain. But I know that they work together. I saw that in the court challenge to campaign finance reform.</p>
        <p>Define ''they.''</p>
        <p>It's interesting. From the A.C.L.U. to the Christian Coalition. From the Republican National Committee to the Democratic Committee of California. And the N.R.A.</p>
        <p>It's generally both extremes on both right and left.</p>
        <p>There's a lot of concern that a war in Iraq will bring higher oil prices and cripple the economy. Why do you think that weaning ourselves off Middle Eastern oil and developing alternative energy sources has not become more of a pressing national security issue?</p>
        <p>It's an issue of leadership. I think the American people need to be informed by our president that if we are really ever going to have the degree of independence that we should have, it requires a reduction of our dependence on imported oil. That means certain sacrifices must be made by the American people.</p>
        <p>Is the president calling on Americans to sacrifice enough?</p>
        <p>If I had advice for the president, I would ask a lot more of the people who are ready to give. I would demand as my top priority legislation increasing national service programs. Also, recognize that climate change is real and start developing concrete policies to address it. The Glacier National Park with no more glaciers. Remarkable.</p>
        <p>Do you think President Bush's tax policy embodies compassionate conservatism?</p>
        <p>No, I don't, because I believe that low-income Americans in totality bear a much higher tax burden than wealthy Americans do, therefore there is a growing gap between the wealthiest and poorest Americans. At least the tax burden should be equitable.</p>
        <p>Any ideas on how to jump-start the economy?</p>
        <p>We probably need to have tax cuts directed at lower-income Americans, such as payroll-tax reductions, but I also think that as long as there continues to be corporate corruption, investor confidence will not be restored and the economy will not be restored. I think we need to put some people in jail.</p>
        <p>Including Ken Lay?</p>
        <p>I would let the courts decide and then hang him.</p>
