        <p>INTERNATIONAL A3-21  Moscow shifted its test ban position from insistence on early agreement for a total nuclear test ban to a new approach that concentrates on limiting the number and size of such tests. Page A1  A U.S.-Canada accord on acid rain will be considered by President Reagan, he said. This marks a significant concession by Mr. Reagan to Canadian demands that he take the acid rain problem more seriously. A1  Salvadoran guerrillas dominate a mountain zone in Chalatenango Department, showing new attention to working with peasants. It is one part of El Salvador where the American-backed Government is not winning the war. A1  South Korea's economic growth has had profound effects on the way people live. Along with prosperity, Koreans now face a worrisome gulf between the haves and the have-nots and the resulting political tensions. A1  A secret U.S.-Japan agreement permitting the United States to take nuclear arms into Japan is explicitly referred to in a document uncovered by Japanese Communist Party members who searched in the Library of Congress. A3  The Pope arrived in Argentina, where he offered a kindly lecture on political responsibilities to the country's leaders. Politics is not expected to occupy as much of his agenda in Argentina as in Chile. A3  Israel's President, in West Germany, began the first visit to that country by an Israeli head of state. Chaim Herzog visited the memorial at the site of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. A12  In Beirut, relief supplies arrived in the Palestinian district of Shatila. It was the first big shipment allowed since the siege of the area by Shiite Moslem militiamen began five months ago. A14  NATIONAL A22-33, D30  Texaco suffered a court setback when the Supreme Court ruled that it should not have been excused by a lower court from posting a bond of more than $10 billion while it appealed a damage award that the Pennzoil Company won against it. A1  Jack Kemp will run for President, he announced. The New York Republican Congressman promised to support a weapons shield in space, ''freedom fighters'' abroad, free enterprise and traditional family values. A22  Children should be taught about sex and AIDS in school and at church, Surgeon General C. Everett Koop said. He recommended that sex education begin in kindergarten. A23  Wheat farmers have been hard hit this year, particularly in Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri by rains that followed other hardships. As a result many will be unable to plant the crops that qualify them for Federal aid. A22  Chicago's mayoral race has changed since a major challenger to Mayor Harold Washington withdrew on Sunday. ''We've got a horse race now,'' said an alderman who opposes the mayor's re-election. A22  Anti-C.I.A. protesters went on trial on charges of trespassing and disorderly conduct at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst last November. They plan to use the proceedings to draw attention to the agency's actions. A26  Many teen-agers are being exploited by door-to-door sales organizations that hold them in virtual servitude, physically abuse them and cheat them of commissions, a Senate subcommittee was told. A25  A new Bureau of Prisons Director has been named, Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d announced. J. Michael Quinlan, 45 years old, has been with the Bureau of Prisons for 16 years, most recently as deputy director. A31  CBS gave its ousted chairman, Thomas H. Wyman, a settlement of more than $4.3 million and an annuity of $400,000 a year for life, a CBS proxy statement said. Mr. Wyman was also paid $1.1 million in salary and bonuses for 1986. D1  Military space projects are being considered by the Pentagon, which is eyeing NASA's proposed space station for a bevy of missions that would propel the Defense Department into a new era of space operations. C1  Data on prisons studied A29  WASHINGTON TALK A32  Jim Wright takes the Speaker's job by the horns  On the Senate press secretary  REGIONAL B1-7  The bodies of three men were found in Schoharie Creek as investigators focused on the floodwaters that swirled around a bridge on the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway when it suddenly collapsed on Sunday. A1  The collapsed bridge's design is common for bridges spanning small bodies of water, according to structural engineers. The steel plate girder design can be found in dozens of other bridges on the Thruway. B5  The bridge detour meant more traffic than usual on the narrow, normally quiet roads of Fort Hunter, N.Y. ''Every car that goes from Buffalo to New York is driving by my house right now,'' one resident said. B4  Two jail officers were dismissed and nine others - including an Assistant Deputy Warden and a Captain -were transferred as a result of a fight at a Brooklyn jail on March 24. B1  A Queens lawyer was sentenced to five years in Federal prison, given five more years on probation and ordered to pay nearly $413,500 in fines and restitution for placing two secretaries in ''no-show'' Assembly jobs. B1  A L.I. man's deportation was blocked temporarily by Associate Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. The man, Karl Linnas, has been condemned to death as a Nazi war criminal in the Soviet Union. B2  Democrats urged an ethics code for state, county, town and village party leaders. The recommendation, from top state leaders, came in reaction to scandals that have engulfed the party in New York City. B1  Jury selection for a Mafia trial began in Federal District Court in Manhattan. Twelve men are accused of rigging bids on construction contracts, intervening in union elections and plotting murders. B3  School payments delayed in Albany B2  Cuomo criticizes Legislature B2  Transit agency eases drug tests B3  Pyramid scam uses ''plane'' B7</p>
