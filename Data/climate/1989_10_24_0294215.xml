        <p>LEAD: Two deadly forms of skin cancer are increasing at alarming rates in the United States, apparently because people are spending more time in the sun, researchers have found.</p>
        <p>Two deadly forms of skin cancer are increasing at alarming rates in the United States, apparently because people are spending more time in the sun, researchers have found.</p>
        <p>In a report in the current issue of The Journal of The American Medical Association, researchers suggested that extensive exposure to ultraviolet rays from the sun should be avoided, particularly since decay of the earth's ozone layer may be permitting heavier doses of the radiation to reach the ground.</p>
        <p>The findings were based on a study of 2,453 cases of skin cancer reported in the Portland, Ore., area from 1960 to 1987. Incidences of the two kinds of cancer, malignant melanoma and squamous cell skin cancer, rose threefold to fourfold over the period, the report said.</p>
        <p>''These epidemic increases have been described before for melanoma, but, because of the lack of systematic reporting over time of non-melanomatous skin cancer, the increases for this malignancy have gone undescribed until now,'' the study said. More Common Than Expected</p>
        <p>Malignant melanoma is the leading cause of death from skin disease in the United States. Among the signs of the disease are changes in a mole or appearance of a new mole.</p>
        <p>Squamous cell skin cancer, which can appear as either an open sore or hard-surfaced lump anywhere on the body, can also spread rapidly and kill. Fair-skinned Caucasians are more susceptible to the diseases than whites with darker skins or members of other races.</p>
        <p>The study was conducted by Kaiser Permanente, a health insurance program, and the National Cancer Institute.</p>
        <p>''Both malignancies are considerably more common in this population than we expected based on previous reports from the general population,'' the study said. ''We may be seeing the result of a widespread change in lifestyle,'' the authors added, with the increase perhaps related to greater outdoor activity and the use of clothing that offers less sun protection.</p>
        <p>One finding of the study was that melanoma of the body's trunk was increasing at a much higher rate in both men and women than squamous cell cancer of the trunk. That probably relates to people wearing no or abbreviated tops while playing or working outdoors, the study said. The researchers said more study is needed to determine all of the factors involved.</p>
        <p>Two other researchers, commenting on the study in an editorial in the journal, said top priority should be given to protecting the earth's ozone shield. They also called for the use of sunscreens with a protection factor of 15 or greater, particularly in fair-skinned children, and additional publicity to alert the public to skin hazards.</p>
