        <p>BY now everyone has seen enough of leaves -- raked, blown, stacked by the curb and so on. Yet leaves are a vital part of our lives, with much to be learned about and from them.</p>
        <p>Of course, the primary function of leaves is that they are true factories. They make the food that replenishes not only the trees they hang on, but us as well. The leaves get their nourishment from two sources: the nutrients in the ground and from the air.</p>
        <p>The process, known as photosynthesis, is probably one of the most remarkable functions on the earth. Leaves have the ability through the chlorophyll in them to use the hydrogen from water with the carbon from the atmosphere and liberate oxygen. This exchange is what makes life possible.</p>
        <p>This important function of leaves helps to explain why there is such concern about global warming and the cutting down of tropical forest lands for short-term agriculture. The world needs these ''lungs of the earth.''</p>
        <p>On the homefront, suburbanites have had their annual fall display,  magnificent in most areas this year, and most have learned that Jack Frost's participation is just what it has been called, a myth. It is the shortening of the days that triggers the fall color.</p>
        <p>But then the leaves drop. Why? They are pushed off. Close examination of the twigs where the leaves were attached will indicate a fine layer of a corklike substance. This is what botanists call the abscission layer. As it forms, gradually, it pushes the leaves off the twigs and sends them to the ground. Naturally, a heavy rain or a good stiff wind will help.</p>
        <p>Remnants can still be seen hanging on the trees this late in the season. Oaks, in particular, are tardy at dropping their leaves, though they finally do. But the beech tree is  unique. The abscission layer does not appear to form on these splendid trees. Even though the leaves do die off, they just hang onto the trees until the spring. When new leaf buds open in the appropriate season, they push off the old leaves.</p>
        <p>One of the main positive factors for having any trees around a property is the cooling shade their canopy can provide in summer. This special quality is sometimes forgotten at this time of year when only the skeleton shows. Yet the shade is one much-loved quality.</p>
        <p>Some trees keep their leaves all year long. These are the conifers or, to a lumber dealer, the softwoods. Even though the leaves may be quite narrow, as in pines, or flat and tight together, as in firs, they have a most special quality: the ability to survive adverse winters.</p>
        <p>This results mainly from a finer evaporation structure so the leaves do not transpire as readily as the larger deciduous leaves. Also, the epidermal layer of evergreen leaves is thicker and in certain species, even has a waxy content.</p>
        <p>One important point for those gardeners who do have a quantity of evergreens on their ground: Always be sure that they go into the winter months with plenty of moisture in the soil. It is not foolhardy to get out the hose and use it if the fall season proves dry. The moist soil will help the trees to replace water that they may lose from sunny and windy days when leaf moisture evaporates.</p>
        <p>Also there is no need to panic if a conifer has a cluster of fallen leaves at its base. Some species keep their leaves for several years; some firs have been known to hang on to leaves for seven or more years. But most evergreens will lose leaves every two to three years. Some pines drop needles every fall.</p>
        <p>Another point to be aware of is the important barometer quality of rhododendron leaves. The normal posture of a rhododendron leaf is just about horizontal. As the thermometer starts to drop, so do the rhododendron leaves, bowing and hanging  down.</p>
        <p>When it really begins to turn cold, the rhododendron leaves start to curl inward, getting tighter and tighter as temperatures drop. In severe cold weather, the leaves look like skinny pencils hanging on the ends of the twigs. Anyone observing this knows it is smart to bundle up before venturing outdoors.</p>
        <p>While outdoors anytime from now on, there is much to be learned by taking a closer look at the twigs of favorite trees. There will be all kinds of buds to see. Some will be the buds for the new leaves to appear next spring. Others, the fatter ones, will be the flowers for, say, May. These buds all have interesting shapes and forms. The fattest are those of the horsechestnut tree flower. They are covered with a waxy substance that protects them until spring is ready for them.</p>
        <p>The turbanlike buds of the dogwoods stand upright on the trees now. Close looks at the garden trees will indicate how magnificent or dull next spring could be.</p>
        <p>These are just a few of the ways to observe what is going on in the great outdoors. And perhaps along the way, the merits of leaves will be more greatly appreciated. There is ever so much more to them than just raking them up once a year to get rid of them.</p>
