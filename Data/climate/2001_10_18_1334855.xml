        <p>Board of Education officials said yesterday that they were at a loss to explain why dozens of students and teachers at Stuyvesant High School had experienced headaches and breathing problems since returning last week to the building, which is four blocks north of the collapsed World Trade Center.</p>
        <p>At a news conference at the board's headquarters, Schools Chancellor Harold O.

        <p>Board of Education officials said yesterday that they were at a loss to explain why dozens of students and teachers at Stuyvesant High School had experienced headaches and breathing problems since returning last week to the building, which is four blocks north of the collapsed World Trade Center.</p>
        <p>At a news conference at the board's headquarters, Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy said that about 80 students and teachers had visited the school nurse with a range of ailments since Stuyvesant reopened on Oct. 9. But Mr. Levy added that air-quality tests, which have been conducted daily at the school, found ''no asbestos and no toxic particulates at any level that would be of concern.'' He said the only potential problem identified by environmental experts was a ''mildly elevated'' level of carbon dioxide, probably because no outside air had been circulated into the building since the students' return.</p>
        <p>''You've got a building where there's stuffiness inside,'' Mr. Levy said. ''It's conceivable that that's related. But we don't know the causality and I'm not suggesting that.''</p>
        <p>At a meeting of Stuyvesant's parent association on Tuesday night, at least 100 anxious parents reported that their children had experienced headaches, itchy eyes, congestion and even bloody noses. Marilena Christodoulou, the parent association president, said yesterday that parents were especially concerned about health problems that might be caused by the cargo on barges north of the school. Every day, trucks deliver debris from the World Trade Center site to the barges, which carry the debris across New York Harbor to Staten Island.</p>
        <p>''The barge operations and related truck traffic and noise pollution present potential danger to the students and staff,'' Ms. Christodoulou said. ''We are requesting that it be moved to another location.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy said he had researched the barge operations and concluded that they did not pose any danger, partly because the barge port was ''not that close'' to the school and partly because cleanup crews were wetting the debris so it would not emit dust.</p>
        <p>Ms. Christodoulou also said that last Thursday, the parent association asked the Board of Education to conduct ongoing tests not only for asbestos, but for fiberglass, lead dust, silica and particulate matter. The board has agreed to do so, she said.</p>
        <p>Other parents said that even if the air in Lower Manhattan is relatively free of toxins, it is indisputably smoky and foul smelling, and they expressed the belief that those conditions are enough to make people who spend a lot of time there at least mildly ill. Mr. Levy said that he had asked the City Health Department to send epidemiologists into the school, ''just to make sure we're not missing anything'' and to determine whether there was a connection between the maladies and the environment.</p>
        <p>One Stuyvesant student, Abbie Zamcheck, said yesterday that his eyes have watered, his nose has run and he has had difficulty breathing since returning to the school building. But he theorized that the smoky, smelly air in Lower Manhattan was exacerbating pre-existing asthma and allergies. He also said that he had been unusually nervous and upset since returning to the school, many of whose 3,000 students witnessed the collapse of the twin towers and feared for their own lives.</p>
        <p>For several weeks after the attack, Stuyvesant students were sent to Brooklyn Technical High School in Fort Greene, making their situation even more stressful. Since returning to their own building, the students have had more homework than usual because they are playing catch-up, Abbie said. Many students also took college admission tests last weekend, adding to their stress levels.</p>
        <p>''After the first couple of days back, I was so stressed I was very sick, and I associated it with being in this area,'' Abbie said. ''It was irrational, I think. I ended up getting more sleep and now I feel fine.''</p>
        <p>Dr. David Appel, a pediatrician at Montefiore Medical Center who supervises 11 school health clinics in the Bronx, said that headaches and asthma were sometimes triggered by stress, and that people suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome often have elevated levels of cortisol, a chemical that can trigger colds and respiratory infections. But he added that the students' symptoms could well be the result of environmental problems.</p>
