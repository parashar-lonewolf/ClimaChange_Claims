        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your article about wind power, ''Is the Answer Blowing in the Wind?'' (Nov. 5), gave an excellent overview of current efforts to tap into this clean, abundant and domestic energy source.</p>
        <p>While wind output is inherently variable, it can be successfully integrated into our electric grid. Contrary to findings in the ABS Energy Research report you cited, a U.K. Energy Research Center report and a paper from United States utility associations find that challenges posed by wind as an intermittent power source are manageable with proper planning and operating procedures.</p>
        <p>A recent study commissioned by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority found that here in New York we could integrate 3,300 megawatts (or 10 percent) of wind power into our grid without any significant reliability problem.</p>
        <p>Wind power alone will not solve our energy problems. But together with other renewable energy technologies, aggressive energy efficiency efforts, and cleaning up our antiquated power plants, wind presents a viable answer.</p>
        <p>Gordian Raacke  Bridgehampton</p>
        <p>The writer is executive director of Renewable Energy Long Island.</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Although wind power may be economic in some locations, articles nearly always give the capacity of the installation (under ideal conditions), not the fraction of the time that the units are actually useful.</p>
        <p>Even the statistics on wind speed give the wrong impression. ''Average'' winds are not the criteria for operation. The percent of the time that the winds are greater than about 14 to 16 miles per hour is the key. For example, equal wind times at 10 and 20 m.p.h. average 15 m.p.h., but generation would only be possible half the time, when the speed is over 14 m.p.h.</p>
        <p>An economic issue, also rarely mentioned, is that because winds are not always blowing, duplicate generation capacity must be built, and paid for, to assure electrical system reliability.</p>
        <p>World societies should, must, deal with carbon dioxide and atmospheric pollution issues, but in order to assess the alternatives, the true economic costs must be completely understood.</p>
        <p>Robert W. Kupp  Tarrytown, N.Y.</p>
        <p>The writer is a retired nuclear engineer.</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Is the Answer Blowing in the Wind?'' highlights the constant tension between energy cost and environmental consequences. As an energy attorney having represented power generators fueled by everything from wind to water, I can tell you that there is a direct relationship between cost of energy and environmental harm -- the lower the cost, the greater the harm.</p>
        <p>Hydrocarbon fuels, the least expensive, have the broadest and greatest harm on the environment. While wind is readily available, it costs more to turn into energy, but its environmental costs have lesser and more limited adverse impact.</p>
        <p>In addition, each fuel source not only has a direct cost, but also an indirect cost: while wind may be ''free,'' what is the cost (read: environmental harm) of fuels and raw materials used in manufacturing the turbines used to make wind power available? How much copper goes into a wind turbine generator? What fuel was used to make it?</p>
        <p>As the verbal tussle between Donald Trump and Richard Kessel, chairman of the Long Island Power Authority, demonstrates, to a great extent environmental pollution is in the eye of the beholder and how it affects his or her pocketbook.</p>
        <p>William C. Ragals Jr.  Pleasantville, N.Y.</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In 1975 we spent our vacation time researching wind energy experiments at NASA's Plum Brook Station and on Long Island. The results of our investigation were published in technical magazines like Power Engineering, Design Engineering and Machine Design.</p>
        <p>Your article stressed the many technological improvements made in the past 30 years. However, it did not include the most important and timely information: Wind energy is available to Long Island residents through Long Island Power Authority affiliation with upstate New York wind farms at an additional cost of 2 cents per kilowatt-hour.</p>
        <p>This is a small price to pay in our fight against global warming and our dependence on foreign oil.</p>
