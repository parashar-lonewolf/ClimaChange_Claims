        <p>No one has been able to get close enough to even see it yet, but for more than a week now a stubborn fire has burned deep within one of the converted limestone mines near here that make up a subterranean world right out of a Batman movie.</p>
        <p>It is a world of paved and lighted roads, a college library, a computer center and train tracks. It serves as the venue for black-tie dinner dances and a 10-kilometer race. And with its even temperature and low humidity, it offers almost perfect storage conditions for hundreds of acres of canned food, toys, stamps and other goods.</p>

        <p>No one has been able to get close enough to even see it yet, but for more than a week now a stubborn fire has burned deep within one of the converted limestone mines near here that make up a subterranean world right out of a Batman movie.</p>
        <p>It is a world of paved and lighted roads, a college library, a computer center and train tracks. It serves as the venue for black-tie dinner dances and a 10-kilometer race. And with its even temperature and low humidity, it offers almost perfect storage conditions for hundreds of acres of canned food, toys, stamps and other goods.</p>
        <p>Most of the mines have modern sprinkler systems, but this fire is in the oldest and second-largest mine, which was developed as a storage site in 1950 before sprinklers were required.</p>
        <p>Fire officials said that they believed the blaze began about 3 A.M. on Dec. 28 but that they did not know the cause or much else about it, including what is burning.  Smoke Hisses Out</p>
        <p>The mine, which is used as a 170-acre storage and distribution center run by Americold Services Corporation in Portland, Ore., lies in the belly of a wooded hill on the outskirts of Kansas City, Kan., just south of the Kansas River, which is usually referred to as the Kaw River. The only evidence of the fire from the muddy shoulder of the road running past the mine has been thick, gray smoke pouring out of a truck entrance, like steam hissing from a tea kettle. Still, residents from miles away have complained about the smoke even though no one has been injured and officials have not ordered evacuations.</p>
        <p>"The fire is way in the back of the mine," said Dennis Cranor, a spokesman for the Kansas City, Kan., Fire Department. "That's been one of our problems in fighting it. Nobody has even seen it yet. The smoke is too heavy."</p>
        <p>As to what is on fire, Mr. Cranor said "we believe it's dry goods," adding: "It could be kitty litter, canned peaches, mustard, pickles, you name it. We just don't know."</p>
        <p>There are 16 converted limestone mines in and around Kansas City, both in Missouri and across the state line in Kansas. As much as 30 million square feet of underground space has been developed into warehouses, offices and some space for manufacturing. Some mines are still worked, and a million tons of limestone is taken out each year. Railroad Cars and Parking Lots</p>
        <p>The mines used for storage are big enough for tractor-trailer trucks to snake along the winding roads past huge support pillars of stone. They are also big enough for railroad cars, parking lots and 1,500 people to race 6.2 miles, or 10 kilometers, in the annual Groundhog Run through one mine.</p>
        <p>"Many people call us a cave," said Connie Kamps, a spokeswoman for the mine owner, Hunt Midwest Enterprises. "Our preference is to call it an 'underground.' Caves are dark. It's great working in here. We don't have to mow the grass or shovel the snow."</p>
        <p>Paul Hilpman, a professor of geology and the director of the Center for Underground Studies at the University of Missouri in Kansas City, said most of the mines now had modern firefighting systems.</p>
        <p>Dozens of businesses lease space in the mines because it can be as much as 50 percent cheaper than it is above in the fresh air and sunshine.</p>
        <p>Other old mines around the nation are used for storage, but because of the geology of the area, the relative flatness of the mine floors here and the way they were initially planned and dug, few communities have as extensive and developed a network as in the Kansas City area, Mr. Hilpman said.</p>
        <p>The Federal Government stores tons of surplus cheese and other dairy products in the mines. And the United States Postal Service's Philatelic Sales Divison, the national distribution center for stamps for collectors, is in a mine here.  Especially Good for Stamps</p>
        <p>The mines are especially good for storing the stamps, among other goods, because the air remains at low humidity and a nearly constant temperature of 55 to 60 degrees.</p>
        <p>But the caves, of course, are not immune to fires, and few fires have more confounded firefighters around here than the current one.</p>
        <p>Stan Sena, senior vice president for Americold Services, said that on Dec. 28 an employee heard a small pop, felt a gust of wind and then saw smoke. Firefighters arrived minutes later. Wearing breathing masks and tanks with enough air for 30 minutes, they inched their way through the smoke.</p>
        <p>Before any could get close enough to the fire to fight it, they had to retreat to refill their air tanks. Later, they borrowed one-hour tanks from another department, but that effort also proved insufficient. Firefighters also tried to create a shortcut to the fire by knocking down several walls with a bulldozer, but that too failed.</p>
        <p>On Saturday, the authorities tried to smother the fire by sealing the mine and pumping in carbon dioxide. But the results of that effort will not be known until the mine is unsealed after three days. Professor Hilpman said he did not believe there would be any serious damage to the mine.</p>
        <p>The fire is the worst in the mines that anyone can remember. The mines first opened in the late 1930's and by the 1950's, mine operators began using them to store equipment and began planning other secondary uses.</p>
        <p>Park College in Parkville, Mo., has converted a mine into a 104,000-volume library, classrooms and a computer center.</p>
        <p>And Bryson Roberts hopes to turn a nearby mine into a tire recycling plant and music studio. "It's a real affordable space," he said.</p>
        <p>But working underground, he said, is not for everyone.</p>
        <p>"A lot of my friends think I'm crazy," he said. "I took my mother over the other day, and she made me turn around and go out. She couldn't handle it. But I like it. It's nice, considering it's a cave."</p>
