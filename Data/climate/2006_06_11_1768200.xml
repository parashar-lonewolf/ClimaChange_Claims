        <p>In a nuclear plant like Westchester's Indian Point, the radioactive decay of fuel rods boils water into steam, which causes turbines to spin at high speeds, generating electricity.</p>
        <p>A similar process also occurs in the high-pressure rhetorical atmosphere surrounding that much-hated plant on the Hudson. Its aging reactors are a steady source of political heat, which sets the pool of public opinion to bubbling and generates large amounts of spin.</p>
        <p>The phenomenon was on vivid display last week, when a committee of the National Academy of Sciences released a report that sharply questioned the wisdom of shutting Indian Point down. Closing the plant is an outcome that many local politicians, environmental groups and wary residents of the region devoutly seek, so when the study emphasized how important the plant was for the region, and how problematic life would be without it, you might have expected its adversaries to express some disappointment, if not outright irritation.</p>
        <p>But Representative Nita Lowey, who secured the $1 million for the federally financed study, said she was ''thrilled'' by its conclusions. "To me, the bottom line is, where there's a will there's a way" to close the plant, she told The Times.</p>
        <p>That's not exactly how we read the report. Yes, it does acknowledge that the technical hurdles to shutting the plant and finding new energy sources to replace it could, in theory, be overcome. But it also leaves one wondering why anyone would want to -- at least for the foreseeable future.</p>
        <p>The region's growing need for energy, coupled with the obstacles to building new and relatively clean power sources, makes Indian Point a necessity by default, the report says. The uncertain economics of the deregulated power industry, high prices for natural gas, community resistance and regional efforts to cut greenhouse gases all combine to make the construction of new power plants of any kind, coal or gas-fired, an iffy proposition.</p>
        <p>Better to cling to Indian Point's 2,000 carbon-free, relatively cheap megawatts, the report advises, than to abandon them without a plausible, and sure, replacement.</p>
        <p>Even with Indian Point, the report suggests, supplies will be tight; within a decade, the region will need 3,000 megawatts of new capacity if Indian Point is running, 5,000 megawatts if it isn't.</p>
        <p>This is not the best news for Ms. Lowey and the others who, quite reasonably, are unnerved by the very idea of having a nuclear plant in the Hudson Valley in the post-9/11 era, particularly one as troubled as this one, with its faulty siren system, leaky tanks and reputation for security gaps.</p>
        <p>But if there is a silver lining, maybe it's this: Rising energy demand and power shortfalls need not be a predestined fate. The fervent debate over Indian Point could inspire an equally full-throated commitment to energy conservation and efficiency, and a willingness to explore other options, like carefully-sited liquefied natural gas facilities and windfarms. Where there's a will, as Ms. Lowey suggested, there may well be a way.</p>
