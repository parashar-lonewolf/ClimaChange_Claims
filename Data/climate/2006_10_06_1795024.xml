        <p>'TALE OF 2CITIES' Opens on Thursday.

        <p>'WRECKS' In previews; opens on Tuesday. Neil LaBute is back at it with a new play -- a solo -- about love, marriage and other sources of pain. The movie star this time is Ed Harris (1:15). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555.</p>
        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'JAY JOHNSON: THE TWO AND ONLY' A genial 90-minute entertainment giving Broadway audiences a chance to get reacquainted with the (almost) lost art of ventriloquism. Jay Johnson, the onetime ''Soap'' star, gives a pocket history of the craft in addition to an ample demonstration, with partners including a vulture who sings '''My Way,''' a foul-mouthed wooden tyke, a talking tennis ball and a monkey purveying some of the corniest shtick this side of a Friar's roast (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped biomusical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Constantine Maroulis, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'BIRTH AND AFTER BIRTH' Baby is a bruiser in Tina Howe's self-conscious foray into the jungles of absurdism. Written in 1972, this explosion of the nuclear family appears to be stepping, with cautious exactitude, in the footprints of early Edward Albee. Christian Parker directed the rather stilted cast (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'BUSH IS BAD: IMPEACHMENT EDITION' A musical revue of silly, heavy-handed sketches aimed at Bush-haters (1:30). Triad Theater, 158 West 72nd Street, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'esoterica' Eric Walton's very entertaining one-man show is a mix of magic, mentalism and intelligent chat. He does all three impressively (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates)</p>
        <p>'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'GARDEL: THE MUSICAL' A standard-issue biomusical about the tango legend Carlos Gardel that wallows in melodrama (1:30). Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, (212) 225-9920. ( Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING' Bill Bowers's zestful, endearing one-man show is about his life as a mime, an actor and a gay boy growing up in Montana (1:15). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, off Seventh Avenue South, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'JOHN FERGUSON' This 1919 tragedy about a poor Irish family and how far its members will go not to lose their farm is a compelling, fully realized drama with a cast that doesn't miss a beat (2:20). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'NO CHILD'  Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'THE PAIN AND THE ITCH'  A sharp-elbowed new comedy by Bruce Norris about the indiscreet hypocrisies of the urban liberal bourgeoisie. Some familiar dysfunctions and some more exotic ones disrupt Thanksgiving dinner. Funny but tough to stomach (2:00). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'RICHARD II' Michael Cumpsty plays the ineffectual king who loses a crown and gains a soul in Brian Kulick's middling production for the Classic Stage Company. Mr. Cumpsty traces Richard's worldly downfall and spiritual ascent with affecting clarity, but the production is a little glib and a little bland (2:15). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'SHOUT!' A miniskirted, go-go-booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the showroom of a Carnival cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'SISTERS' Declan Hassett's dark tale of sibling rivalry set in rural Ireland occasions the welcome return to the New York stage of Anna Manahan, the Irish actress who won a Tony in 1998 playing the ferociously needy mother in Martin McDonagh's ''Beauty Queen of Leenane.'' A bit less welcome is Mr. Hassett's relentlessly downbeat play itself (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'SONGS OF THE DRAGONS FLYING TO HEAVEN' Young Jean Lee has fashioned a hysterically funny piece of theater with twisted socio-political power and giggly Korean dancers who would fit right into a Quentin Tarantino movie (1:30). HERE Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 868-4444. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'SUBURBIA' This black-hole revival of Eric Bogosian's 1994 group portrait of losers in Angstville, U.S.A., directed by Jo Bonney, features lively performances from Gaby Hoffman, Kieran Culkin and Jessica Capshaw. But even if you're as success-addicted as Donald Trump, you're likely to find yourself identifying with these characters in the wrong way: They're beyond caring what happens to them, and so are you (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'THEOPHILUS NORTH' Matthew Burnett's adaptation of the Thornton Wilder novel about a young man's not quite interpersonal relationships in 1926 Newport is affable if sometimes oversentimental (2:00). Harold Clurman Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'THE TREATMENT' A new play by Eve Ensler (''The Vagina Monologues'') depicting fraught encounters between a traumatized war veteran and a military psychologist. Fervently acted by Dylan McDermott and Portia, it is an overwrought amalgam of psychodrama and political sermonizing (1:05). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983, impactfestival.org. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'wasps in bed' This Berkshires-to-bedroom farce would make a clever sitcom, if only the authors would face the fact that it isn't really about sex (1:45). Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Gates)</p>
        <p>Off Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'FOOLS AND LOVERS' The idea itself is questionable: let's make a musical about a chintzy wedding based entirely on Shakespearean texts. And the realization does not improve on the inspiration. Andrew Sherman's music perfectly duplicates the aesthetic of a second-rate wedding band, and to add a layer of realism, many of the actors have trouble carrying a tune. All that the exercise ultimately proves is that you can make Shakespeare say anything (1:20). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. (Anne Midgette)</p>
        <p>Long-Running Shows</p>
        <p>* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). New World Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)</p>
        <p>'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)</p>
        <p>'SPAMALOT'  A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans. (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>'ALLENDE: THE DEATH OF A PRESIDENT'  A dry history lesson about the final hours of Salvador Allende, the Marxist president of Chile who died in 1973 during a military coup (1:15). Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 254-1109; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'LEMKIN'S HOUSE' The man who invented the word genocide, Raphael Lemkin, turns out to have an unsettled afterlife in this compelling drama by Catherine Filloux. He learns, through visitations by Tutsis and others, that the international law he campaigned for against genocide may not have accomplished anything. John Daggett is impressive as Lemkin (1:20). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Neil Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>'OFF-STAGE: THE WEST VILLAGE FRAGMENTS' A warm-hearted and well-researched mix of walking tour and performance that offers a sampling menu of excerpts from plays from the origins of Off Off Broadway (2:00). Various locations throughout Greenwich Village, (212) 529-3626; closes tomorrow. (Zinoman)</p>
        <p>* 'SEVEN GUITARS' Life and death dance cheek to cheek in this fine new revival of August Wilson's drama from 1996. Directed by Ruben Santiago-Hudson, and acted with absorbing restraint and immediacy, this is a truly life-size production, which means it is big indeed (2:45). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529; closes tomorrow. (Brantley)</p>

        <p>'ALL THE KING'S MEN' (PG-13, 120 minutes) This second adaptation of Robert Penn Warren's big novel of political and spiritual corruption in Depression-era Louisiana is full of grand themes, good actors (Jude Law, Sean Penn, Kate Winslet, Mark Ruffalo) and lovingly-photographed southern scenery. And yet nothing seems to work. It's a chaotic stew of ambitions and ideas, but in the end neither convincing nor coherent. (A. O. Scott)</p>
        <p>'THE BLACK DAHLIA' (R, 119 minutes) Brian De Palma drains the life out of James Ellroy's take on the spectacularly cruel 1947 murder of a young Los Angeles woman known as the Black Dahlia. The stars Josh Hartnett, Scarlett Johansson and Aaron Eckhart don't help matters, though Hilary Swank is dandy. (Manohla Dargis)</p>
        <p>'BROKEN SKY' (No rating, 140 minutes, in Spanish) Boy meets boy, as you've never seen, in Julián Hernández's sex-drenched, extravagantly minimalist epic. (Nathan Lee)</p>
        <p>'THE COVENANT' (PG-13, 97 minutes) The director Renny Harlin proves that ''Exorcist: The Beginning'' was not the nadir of his career with this thriller about boy witches fending off a nefarious transfer student. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'EVERYONE'S HERO' (G, 88 minutes) Animated in name only, ''Everyone's Hero'' follows a 10-year-old baseball fanatic as he tries to return Babe Ruth's stolen bat. Largely indifferent to its Depression-era setting, the movie is even less concerned with the need for enchantment. But since this is the last creative collaboration of Christopher and Dana Reeve, the movie's sentimental provenance could earn it a critical pass it doesn't deserve. (Jeannette Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'FACTOTUM' (R, 94 minutes) Matt Dillon goes deep to play Henry Chinaski, the familiar alter ego of the great Charles Bukowski, who survived countless benders, brawls, rejection slips, crazy women and soul-killing jobs. The Norwegian filmmaker Bent Hamer directed. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* '49 UP' (No rating, 134 minutes) In the latest installment of documentary cinema's longest-running, most fascinating experiment, the British schoolchildren first interviewed in ''7 Up'' (1964) have settled into middle age. As always, there are quiet revelations and surprises, and ordinary human experience somehow becomes more fascinating and mysterious than any other subject. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'FLYBOYS' (PG-13, 129 minutes) Empty-headed and egregiously polite, this nostalgia trip to World War I is what you'd get if Norman Rockwell directed ''Top Gun.'' (Lee)</p>
        <p>'GRIDIRON GANG' (PG-13, 120 minutes) Set in a California juvenile detention center, ''Gridiron Gang'' stars Dwayne Johnson, best known as the Rock, as Sean Porter, the real-life probation officer who fights recidivism with football. Jumping from heartwarming to murderous, this is a sports-as-rehab movie that wants to have its gangbanging and cure it, too. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'A GUIDE TO RECOGNIZING YOUR SAINTS' (R, 98 minutes) Rough, ragged and full of life, this autobiographical movie, written and directed by Dito Montiel, about his youth on the streets of Astoria, Queens, is a remarkable debut, stuffed almost to bursting with bold performances and operatic emotions. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'THE GUARDIAN' (PG-13, 139 minutes) A veteran Coast Guard rescue swimmer (Kevin Costner) mentors a young hotshot swimming champion (Ashton Kutcher) in this predictable, overly long but nonetheless serviceable tribute to a branch of the United States military that has been somewhat neglected in the movies. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'HOLLYWOODLAND' (R, 126 minutes) A fictional look at the life and downward-spiraling times of George Reeves, the man who played Superman on television and is here played by a fine Ben Affleck. Allen Coulter directs Paul Bernbaum's screenplay, which features a dead-end parallel plot about a detective (Adrien Brody). (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'IDLEWILD' (R, 120 minutes) André Benjamin and Antwan A. Patton, a k a André 3000 and Big Boi of OutKast, play friends living and sometimes singing in Depression-era Georgia. The joint doesn't jump; it twitches and stumbles. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'THE ILLUSIONIST' (PG-13, 109 minutes) This film tells the story of Eisenheim (Edward Norton), a fictional conjurer who enraptured Viennese audiences in 1900 with his supernatural magic shows. A terrific yarn, it rouses your slumbering belief in the miraculous. (Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'INVINCIBLE' (PG, 99 minutes) The latest addition to the Disney stable of sports-underdog movies, ''Invincible'' is the true story of Vince Papale (Mark Wahlberg), a substitute teacher and part-time bartender, who in 1976 realizes his dream of playing for the Philadelphia Eagles. The director and cinematographer, Ericson Core, counters the story's predictably inspirational trajectory with close attention to historical detail and blue-collar hardship. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'JACKASS: NUMBER TWO' (R, 92 minutes) Debased, infantile and reckless in the extreme, this compendium of body bravado and malfunction makes for some of the most fearless, liberated and cathartic comedy in modern movies. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'jet li's FEARLESS' (PG-13, 105 minutes, in Mandarin) Jet Li says goodbye (supposedly) to the martial arts genre with this decent blend of old-school chopsocky and new-school superproduction. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker plays the mad king while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'THE LAST KISS' (R, 104 minutes) Tony Goldwyn's remake of a popular Italian film is thin and clumsy, but nonetheless unusually candid in its treatment of human sexual misbehavior. Zach Braff plays a young man who, on the brink of turning 30 and about to become a father, panics and cheats on his girlfriend (Jacinda Barrett). (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'Little Miss Sunshine' (R, 101 minutes) A bittersweet comedy of dysfunction that takes place at the terminus of the American dream. The excellent cast includes Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano and that national treasure, Alan Arkin. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'OPEN SEASON' (PG, 100 minutes) In this grand-scale animated comedy-adventure about a grizzly bear and a mule deer who assemble an oddball army of animals to fight the hunters, periodic bursts of cleverness and eye-popping imagery, further enhanced in the 3-D IMAX version, can't disguise that it's just another movie full of jive-talking computer-generated animals with little new to say. (Laura Kern)</p>
        <p>* 'THE QUEEN' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Directed by Stephen Frears from a very smart script by Peter Morgan, and starring a magnificent Helen Mirren in the title role, ''The Queen'' pries open a window in the House of Windsor around the time of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, blending fact with fiction. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'SCHOOL FOR SCOUNDRELS' (PG-13, 101 minutes) Billy Bob Thornton stars as an alpha scoundrel who runs a self-improvement course for sad sacks of the sort persuasively played by the film's other lead actor, Jon Heder. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'THE SCIENCE OF SLEEP' (R, 106 minutes, in English, French and Spanish) A bittersweet dream of romance from Michel Gondry. Inventive and enchanting. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'Scoop' (PG-13, 96 minutes) A not especially funny yet oddly appealing comedy in which Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson make like Nick and Nora, but with more shtick and no martinis (or Asta). (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'SHORTBUS' (No rating, 102 minutes) John Cameron Mitchell's ode to the joy and sweet release of sex also manages to be a sincere, modest political venture that finds humor where you might least expect it. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'the WICKER MAN' (PG-13, 106 minutes) In remaking a 1973 British horror classic, Neil LaBute once again demonstrates his misogyny and, worse, his technical incompetence. (Scott)</p>

        <p>BASEMENT JAXX (Wednesday) Basement Jaxx is an English disc-jockey duo that, happily, won't stay in any dance-music niche as it collaborates with all sorts of singers and songwriters. Its new album, ''Crazy Itch Radio'' (XL), dips into 1970's funk and soul, Balkan brass bands, updated swing and even banjo picking over a house beat. Onstage it keeps people dancing.

        <p>GIPSY KINGS (Tomorrow) Strumming half a dozen guitars, singing in a husky rasp and stamping their heels on the floor, the members of this French pop group are to flamenco what Rice-a-Roni is to paella.

At 9 p.m., Rebel, 251 West 30th Street, Manhattan, (212) 695-6115; $15. (Sisario)</p>

(Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>MERCYME (Sunday) Like a number of Christian rock bands, this one is known for a kind of yearning modern rock that wouldn't sound out of place on a secular radio station; the band has a following that many secular acts probably envy.

        <p>RATATAT (Tonight) The two guitarists who make up Ratatat have one simple but sometimes charming idea.

        <p>* WOLF EYES; JOHN WIESE; THURSTON MOORE AND PRURIENT (Tonight) An all-star lineup of noise-rock. The members of Wolf Eyes, from Michigan, once described themselves as ''the Lynyrd Skynyrd of noise,'' and meant it: the group's rumbling, nightmarish clangor is in one sense a straightforward exposition of a kind of elemental rock artistry. The prolific John Wiese, from Los Angeles, has collaborated with pretty much everybody in this scene, including Thurston Moore, the Sonic Youth guitarist and art-rock figurehead.

        <p>* DWIGHT YOAKAM (Thursday) A honky-tonk country classicist, Dwight Yoakam writes terse, twangy songs that juggle heartache and resentment and sings them in a voice full of honeyed tension. At 8 p.m., the Concert Hall at The New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, (212) 874-5210, theconcerthall.org;$40 to $45. (Pareles)</p>

        <p>BALLIN' THE JACK (Sunday) This midsize ensemble, led by the clarinetist and saxophonist Matt Darriau, customarily spikes a swing-era repertory with madcap irreverence. That's especially true on this one-night stand, which features music from Marx Brothers film soundtracks, complete with Grouchoesque vocals from the alto saxophonist Roy Nathanson. At 9 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8. (Nate Chinen)</p>
        <p>ANDY BISKIN AND TRIO TRAGICO (Tonight) On his new album, ''Trio Tragico'' (Strudelmedia), Mr. Biskin presents a small chamber group consisting of himself on clarinet, Dave Ballou on trumpet and Drew Gress on bass. Their repertory ranges from melodic miniatures, by Mr. Biskin, to nearly open-form improvisation, collectively determined. At 9 and 10:30, Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>RICHARD BONA (Tuesday through Thursday) Mr. Bona, the Cameroonian bassist and vocalist, has an appealing new album, ''Tiki'' (Decca), that confirms his commitment to musical globalism. He leads a six-piece group that includes the trumpeter Taylor Haskins, the keyboardist Etienne Stadwijk and the drummer Ernesto Simpson. At 9 and 11 p.m. and 12:30 a.m., Zinc Bar, 90 West Houston Street, at LaGuardia Place, West Village, (212) 477-8337, zincbar.com; cover, $5, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>MATT BREWER QUARTET (Tomorrow) The bassist Matt Brewer has lately distinguished himself in bands led by the saxophonist Greg Osby; this group features another adventurous saxophonist, Tony Malaby, along with Frank Locrasto on piano, and Rodney Green on drums. At 8 and 10 p.m., The Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>* PETER BRÖTZMANN AND HAN BENNINK (Tonight) Few modern saxophonists can sound as powerfully abrasive as Mr. Brötzmann, and few drummers can seem as convincingly unhinged as Mr. Bennink. Each is a pillar of the European free-improvising scene, and a touchstone for the rambunctious wing of the contemporary avant-garde. At 7:30 and 9, Clemente Soto Vélez Cultural Center, 107 Suffolk Street, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 696-6681, visionfestival.org; $20; students, $10 (Chinen)</p>
        <p>RAY BROWN TRIBUTE BAND (Tonight through Sunday night) A tribute to Ray Brown, the quintessential jazz bassist, consisting of younger artists who had the chance to work with him: the singer Dee Dee Bridgewater, the pianist Benny Green, the drummer Greg Hutchinson and, slyly grinning in the hot seat, the bassist Christian McBride. At 8 and 10:30, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>JAMES CARTER ORGAN TRIO (Wednesday and Thursday) James Carter, the irrepressibly charismatic saxophonist, leads a sturdy and occasionally surprising soul-jazz unit with the Hammond B-3 organist Gerard Gibbs and the drummer Leonard King. (Through Oct. 14.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>STEPHAN CRUMP (Wednesday) As a bassist and composer, Mr. Crump avoids obvious routes but manages never to lose his way, as he demonstrates on his intimate new album, ''Rosetta'' (Papillon Sounds). He celebrates the album's release by regrouping the two sensitive guitarists it showcases, Liberty Ellman (on acoustic) and Jamie Fox (on electric). At 9:45 p.m., Cutting Room, 19 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 691-1900, thecuttingroomnyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>FESTIVAL OF NEW TRUMPET MUSIC (Tomorrow and Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) This series continues this weekend at Tonic with such sharp-minded trumpeters as Thomas Heberer (tonight) and David Weiss (tomorrow). Next week it moves to Cornelia Street Café, with up-and-comers like Bart Miltenberger (Tuesday), John McDonough (Wednesday) and Nate Wooley (Thursday). Tomorrow and Sunday at 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; cover, $12 and $15.

Detailed festival information is at fontmusic.org. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>KENNY GARRETT QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Kenny Garrett is a bulldozer on the alto saxophone, which he applies toward blazing post-Coltrane calisthenics, and an introspective artisan on the soprano, with which he investigates East Asian folk timbres. His recent album on Nonesuch, ''Beyond the Wall'' was inspired by the ancient cultures of China and Africa. He'll revisit it with a band consisting of Benito Gonzalez on piano, Kris Funn on bass and Jamire Williams on drums. At 9 and 11, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>DAVID GILMORE (Monday) Mr. Gilmore favors the clean guitar tone of George Benson, but his playing tends more toward an African rhythmic concept and a slippery melodic sensibility. He is performing with the all-star group from his new album, ''Unified Presence'' (RKM): Ravi Coltrane on tenor and soprano saxophones, Christian McBride on bass, Jeff (Tain) Watts on drums and, as a special guest, the vocalist Claudia Acuña. At 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778, joespub.com; cover, $15, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>JIMMY HEATH'S 80TH-BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION (Wednesday and Thursday) The saxophonist and composer Jimmy Heath will turn 80 this month, and the Blue Note is celebrating the occasion next week with a five-night run replete with special guests. On Wednesday and Thursday, that means Bill Cosby, as host and M.C. (Through Oct. 15.) At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>JOHN HEBERT'S BYZANTINE MONKEY (Wednesday) This experimental ensemble features the original music and bass playing of John Hebert, along with the contributions of Tony Malaby and Michaël Attias, saxophonists, and Nasheet Waits, a drummer. At 10 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>GERRY HEMINGWAY/ELLERY ESKELIN DUO (Tomorrow) Texture outweighs tempo in Mr. Hemingway's drumming, and his compositions reveal a fruitful fascination with polytonality. Mr. Eskelin, a tenor saxophonist, has a predilection for expressive gruffness, but he tends to find the groove even in formless expanses. At 8:30 p.m., Center for Improvisational Music, 295 Douglass Street, between Third and Fourth Avenues, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (212) 631-5882, schoolforimprov.org; cover, $12; students, $8. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>FRANK KIMBROUGH (Tonight) Mr. Kimbrough is a thoughtful and harmonically literate pianist, with equal taste for melody and abstraction. He appears as part of a new Fazioli Salon solo piano series at the Klavierhaus workshop. At 8, Klavierhaus, 211 West 58th Street, Manhattan, (212) 245-4535, pianoculture.com; $20. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>STEVE LEHMAN'S BLUEPRINT TRIO (Sunday) Steve Lehman, an alto saxophonist and composer, favors jagged intervals and surging rhythmic patterns in this working band, with Matt Brewer on bass, and Eric McPherson on drums. At 8 p.m., The Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>TONY MALABY, WILLIAM PARKER, NASHEET WAITS (Sunday) A promising meeting of three accomplished yet restless improvisers, with experience both in and out of the avant-garde: Mr. Malaby, saxophonist; Mr. Parker, bassist; and Mr. Waits, drummer. At 8 and 10 p.m., Jimmy's No. 43, 43 East Seventh Street, East Village, (212) 982-3006, freestylejazz.com; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>* BRANFORD MARSALIS QUARTET (Tonight through Sunday night) Branford Marsalis leads one of the most athletic working bands in the jazz mainstream, a point of pride he playfully acknowledges with the locker-room photograph on the cover of his new album, ''Braggtown'' (Marsalis Music). The ensemble -- with Joey Calderazzo on piano, Eric Revis on bass and Jeff (Tain) Watts on drums -- doesn't work often in clubs, which makes this engagement all the more significant. At 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $35. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>* BRAD MEHLDAU TRIO (Tuesday through Thursday) The pianist Brad Mehldau recently renovated the sound of his longstanding trio, with help from the powerfully expressive drummer Jeff Ballard. The group's luminous brand of lyricism has survived, but its repertory is slightly more pop-oriented, and its rhythmic tumble more pronounced. (Through Oct. 15.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>PETE ROBBINS (Sunday) The choral music of the Italian Renaissance composer Carlo Gesualdo has recently provided inspiration for the creative energies of Mr. Robbins, an alto saxophonist and clarinetist. His ''Gesualdo Adaptations'' feature a modernistic ensemble of two saxophonists, two guitarists and an electric keyboard, along with bass and drums. At 8 p.m., Bar 4, 444 Seventh Avenue, at 15th Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 832-9800, bar4.net; suggested donation, $5. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>* KURT ROSENWINKEL QUINTET (Tonight through Sunday night) Kurt Rosenwinkel's electric guitar has an airy tone that offsets the cerebral twinge of his compositions, and his rapport with the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner borders on the telepathic. The two musicians are backed by Aaron Parks on piano, Joe Martin on bass and Jeff Ballard on drums. At 9 and 11, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>MATT WILSON QUARTET (Tonight) Mr. Wilson, a mischievous and nimble drummer, leads a rugged quartet with the trumpeter Jon Sneider, the saxophonist Jeff Lederer and the bassist Martin Wind. At 10, Detour, 349 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 533-6212; cover, $5. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>* A TRIBUTE TO RAY BARRETTO (Tomorrow) This salute to the conga player Ray Barretto, who died this year, features a version of his orchestra, with guests including the singers Adalberto Santiago, Tito Allen and Ray De La Paz; the percussionist Giovanni Hidalgo; the bassist Andy Gonzalez; the pianist Oscar Hernandez, who doubles as musical director; and the tenor saxophonist Chris Barretto, who follows in his father's footsteps as a jazz musician. Also on hand is the Machito Orchestra, led by Mario Grillo. At 8 p.m., Lehman Center for the Performing Arts, 250 Bedford Park Boulevard West, at Goulden Avenue, Bedford Park, the Bronx, (718) 960-8833, lehmancenter.org; $35 to $45. (Chinen)</p>

        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>'CARMEN' (Tomorrow and Thursday) Rinat Shaham, who made her company debut as Zerlina, is a small singer for Carmen; worse, the New York City Opera's production seems to have veiled her spark, rendering her a mere stereotype. Her Don José, Mark Duffin, has warm lower notes and a pressed, often flat sound on top; the Escamillo is Adrian Gans, who was too nervous to be judged at his company debut in the role. The high point is Latonia Moore, a radiant-voiced Micaëla who seems to belong to a world apart from this rather pedestrian production. Ari Pelto conducts, a little woodenly but competently enough. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $130. (Anne Midgette)</p>
        <p>'L'ELISIR D'AMORE' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) The director Jonathan Miller updates Donizetti's lively comic opera from a rustic Italian setting to a 1950's American diner in this New York City Opera production. The cast includes Anna Skibinsky as Adina, and Erin Morley as Giannetta (both making their company debuts), John Tessier as Nemorino, Paulo Szot as Belcore and Jan Opalach as Dulcamara. George Manahan conducts the New York City Opera orchestra in Donizetti's tuneful score. At 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Vivien Schweitzer)</p>
        <p>'FAUST' (Tonight and Thursday) Gounod's lush score is back at the Metropolitan Opera in Andrei Serban's staging, now less hyperactive than when it was introduced in 2005. Alas, someone appears to have gotten to its soul before Méphistophélès had the chance: the singers, though all fine, put the drama at arm's length, so the work's intense passions don't quite come through. In the cast: Ramón Vargas in the title role, Ruth Ann Swenson as Marguerite, and Ildar Abdrazakov as Méphistophélès, with Bertrand de Billy conducting. Tonight at 8 and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $375. (Allan Kozinn)</p>
        <p>'LA GIOCONDA' (Tomorrow) Grand opera does not get much grander or more theatrical or more violent than this. The traditional production by the Metropolitan Opera stars Violeta Urmana and Olga Borodina, with Marcello Giordani taking over as Enzo. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; metopera.org; $42 to $375. (Bernard Holland)</p>
        <p>* 'IDOMENEO'  (Tuesday) Those who count on Ben Heppner to sing the heldentenor repertory may be surprised to hear him in the title role of Mozart's 1781 opera seria ''Idomeneo,'' staged by the Metropolitan Opera. But this role of the tormented king of Crete after the Trojan War has heroic dimensions, dramatically and vocally, which Mr. Heppner relishes in his clarion and compelling yet elegantly Mozartean portrayal. Other standouts in the cast include the exquisite soprano Dorothea Röschmann as the captured princess Ilia and the rich-voiced mezzo-soprano Kristine Jepson as Idomeneo's devoted son Idamante. James Levine conducts a refined account of a work he clearly loves. Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's elegantly stylized 1982 production is still handsome and effective. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $275. (Anthony Tommasini)</p>
        <p>'THE MARRIAGE OF FIGARO' (Tonight through Sunday) Now in its 59th season, the Amato Opera continues to stage productions in its charmingly tiny quarters on the Bowery. This weekend it continues its run of Mozart's ''Marriage of Figaro,'' with a rotating cast. The quality varies and depends largely on who is singing that night, but the spirit is often there. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 2:30 p.m., Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200, amato.org; $35; $28 for students and 65+. (Schweitzer)</p>
        <p>'THE MERRY WIDOW' (Tomorrow and Sunday) The enterprising Dicapo Opera Theater has some ambitious productions lined up for this season, including a revised version of ''Thérèse Raquin'' by Tobias Picker, who composed ''An American Tragedy'' for the Metropolitan Opera. But Dicapo opens its season with a new production by Michael Capasso of the frothy, tuneful and worldly-wise Franz Lehár operetta ''The Merry Widow.'' The production will use spoken dialogue that was essentially rewritten by the playwright Wendy Wasserstein. Constantine Kitsopoulos conducts. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 4 p.m., Dicapo Opera Theater, 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-9438, dicapo.com; $47.50. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>'DIE TOTE STADT' (Sunday) The composer Erich Wolfgang Korngold is best known for his pioneering scores for swashbuckling Hollywood films of the 1930's. But in Germany in 1920, at the age of 24, he was hailed as the brilliant and promising composer of a mysterious opera, ''Die Tote Stadt.'' The New York City Opera, which has been a champion of this neglected work, has revived its 1975 production, which incorporates film elements, video projections and scrims to evoke the dreamlike story. The cast, though not ideal, is appealing, and George Manahan conducts a sweeping account of Korngold's lyrically sumptuous and theatrical music. At 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $25 to $125. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>'DIE ZAUBERFLOTE' (Tomorrow and Monday) Julie Taymor's production of Mozart's fairytale opera ''Die Zauberflöte,'' introduced in 2004, did not please everyone, including this critic. But overall it was an enormous hit with Met audiences. To me the production was so packed with nonstop stage effects, so overly busy and so peopled with dancers, extras, gargantuan puppets and kitelike animals of every sort that the fine musical performances by the conductor James Levine and cast took a back seat to the stage show. The conductor Scott Bergeson takes the podium for the Met's current revival. The promising cast includes Isabel Bayrakdarian as Pamina, Jonas Kaufmann as Tamino and Nathan Gunn as Papageno. Tomorrow at 1:30 and Monday at 7:30, the Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $375. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>Classical Music</p>
        <p>BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) This converted coffee barge is one of the most intimate chamber music halls in the city, and its programs are growing more varied all the time. Tonight Katya Mihailova, a pianist; William Harvey, a violinist; and Chris Gross, a cellist, play piano trios by Haydn, Dvorak and Adolphus Hailstork. Tomorrow and Sunday another ensemble -- Naoko Tanaka, a violinist; Masao Kawasaki, a violist; Joseph Lee, a cellist; and Rita Sloan, a pianist -- play Mozart's Piano Quartet No. 1 (K. 478) and works for violin and piano by Mozart and Shostakovich. And on Thursday the pianist Hamish Milne plays Bach's Partita No. 4, Beethoven's Sonata in E (Op. 109) and works by Medtner and Chopin. Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday nights at 7:30; Sunday at 4. Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083, bargemusic.org; $35; $20 for students; $30 for 65+ tonight and Thursday only. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Monday) To start its Carnegie Hall appearances in James Levine's third season as music director, the orchestra is performing the Viennese Schools, first and second, in two piano concertos, one by Beethoven (the fourth), one by Schoenberg. Both feature as soloist another conductor with a wide and ambitious range, Daniel Barenboim. Also on the program is the string-orchestra version of Schoenberg's ''Verklärte Nacht.'' At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $39 to $127. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Thursday) If you think that the Chamber Music Society's usual home, Alice Tully Hall, is too big for this intimate repertory, here's a chance to hear the ensemble in closer confines. Stephen Taylor, the oboist; Jose Franch-Ballester, the clarinetist; Peter Kolkay, the bassoonist; Stewart Rose, the hornist; and Inon Barnatan, the pianist, recombine in various configurations to play the Francaix Divertissement, the Poulenc Trio and Beethoven's Quintet in E flat for Winds and Piano (Op. 16). At 6:45, the Rose Studio, (212) 875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org; sold out. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>* VLADIMIR FELTSMAN (Tuesday and Thursday) In a surprising shift from his modern piano comfort zone, this thoughtful artist is performing all of Mozart's piano sonatas on a modern copy of a Mozart-era Walter fortepiano. The five recitals are split between the New School and the Mannes College of Music. In the final two installments, Mr. Feltsman will play the Sonatas in F (K. 533), C (K. 545) and C minor (K. 457), and the Fantasia in C minor (K. 475), on Tuesday at Mannes; he will perform the Sonatas in B flat (K. 570) and D (K. 576), as well as the Fantasia in D minor (K. 385), the Rondo in D (K. 485) and the Adagio in B minor (K. 540) on Thursday at the New School.

        <p>BEN HEPPNER/WENDY BRYN HARMER/CRAIG RUTENBERG (Thursday) For its recital series, the George London Foundation pairs established vocal stars with young recipients of the foundation's annual award. Pairing Ms. Harmer, a soprano, with Mr. Heppner, a popular tenor, has paid off: the event is already sold out. At 7:30 p.m., Morgan Library, 225 Madison Avenue (36th Street), (212) 685-0008, www.themorgan.org. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>THE JUILLIARD ORCHESTRA (Thursday) This excellent band of polished young musicians will show what they can do with Beethoven's Symphony No. 7 in A; Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 in B-flat minor, with Konstantin Soukhovetski as soloist; and Richard Strauss's Wiener Philharmoniker Fanfare. James DePriest, Juilliard's director of conducting and orchestral studies, leads the program. At 8 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Juilliard School, Broadway at 65th Street, (212) 769-7406, www.juilliard.edu; free. (Schweitzer)</p>
        <p>LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tomorrow) The orchestra's Beethoven cycle with Bernard Haitink begins with the Second and Third Symphonies and will continue through the week. If recordings are an indication, these should be honest, sturdy and ultimately winning performances. At 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $35 to $85. (Holland)</p>
        <p>LEON MCCAWLEY (Sunday) This British pianist is active across Europe, but has not yet been heard in recital in New York. He will perform a few signature pieces, including a suite by Hans Gál, an émigré Austrian composer whose complete piano works Mr. McCawley has recorded, and the K. 311 sonata by Mozart. (A complete sonata cycle is due out soon.) The program also includes Schubert's D. 537 sonata and some pieces by Rachmaninoff. At 5 p.m, Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 547-0715, frick.org; $25. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>* NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight) Lorin Maazel leads the Philharmonic in its second complete performance of Ravel's one-act opera ''L'Enfant et les Sortilèges.'' (The first performance was yesterday.) The soprano Patrizia Ciofi is making her Philharmonic debut; the mezzo-soprano is Susanne Mentzer. The lineup also includes the soprano Jessica Jones, the mezzo-sopranos Isabel Leonard and Kelley O'Connor, the baritone Ian Greenlaw, the tenor Philippe Castagner (all making their Philharmonic debuts) and the bass Kevin Deas. The second half of the program features Saint-Saëns's Symphony No. 3, ''Organ.'' The Philharmonic's organist, Kent Tritle, is the soloist. At 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5656, nyphil.org; $28 to $94. (Schweitzer)</p>
        <p>* ORCHESTRA OF ST. LUKE'S (Thursday) The Bach specialist Mary Dalton Greer conducts the Orchestra of St. Luke's and the New York Baroque Soloists in ''Bach Dialogues for Soprano and Bass,'' the first of three programs in the ''Cantatas in Context'' series, now in its seventh season. Dominique Labelle, a soprano, and Christopheren Nomura, a baritone, will sing Bach's ''Liebster Jesu, mein Verlangen'' (BWV 32), ''Ich geh und suche mit Verlangen'' (BWV 49) and ''Ach Gott, wie manches Herzeleid'' (BWV 58). At 7:30, St. Bartholomew's Church, 109 East 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 378-0248, oslmusic.org; $25 to 35. (Schweitzer)</p>

        <p>DOROTHEA RÖSCHMANN/GRAHAM JOHNSON (Thursday) In recital, American singers tend to want to show their versatility (''Look, Ma, I can sing in five languages!'') This fine German soprano is, by contrast, sticking to her home language with an all-Viennese program. She strays afield only with some of Schubert's Scottish songs -- including all three of ''Ellen's Gesänge,'' one of which is better known as ''Ave Maria.'' The program also includes a set of Mahler and Berg's ''Sieben frühe Lieder.'' At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $29 to $42. (Midgette)</p>

(Anderson)</p>
        <p>LIGHTCURVE DANCE AND MIXED MEDIA (Tonight through Sunday night) ''Panicky Mechanical Loam Realm'' blends lucid movements with ethereal costumes, layers of video projections and a collage of sounds. At 8, Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 334-7479, joyce.org/soho.html; $15; $12 for students and 65+. (Anderson)</p>
        <p>LYON OPERA BALLET (Tonight and tomorrow night) In its only New York City-area performance this season, the Lyon company will perform two different programs featuring ballets by William Forsyth; the company director, Maguy Marin; and Sasha Waltz; with two views of Beethoven's Grosse Fugue in choreography by Ms. Marin and Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker.

        <p>NEW YORK BAROQUE DANCE COMPANY (Today) The company will perform ''An Entertaining Assembly for George Washington,'' a half-hour period concert in the style of a dance ball, which includes a game of Blind Man's Buff performed to ''Yankee Doodle.''

At 8 p.m., World Financial Center at the Winter Garden, 220 Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505, worldfinancialcenter.com; free. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>PHILADANCO (Tonight through Sunday) Works by Ronald K. Brown, Christopher Huggins and Danny Ezralow headline this Philadelphia troupe's return to the Joyce, but the dancers' rich, energetic interpretations promise to be the highlight.

        <p>RENNIE HARRIS' NEW YORK LEGENDS OF HIP-HOP (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) The multitudinous aspects of a musical and choreographic form that spread from city streets into theaters will be explored in performances by Mr. Harris, Pop Master Fabel, the Rock Steady Crew, the Mop Tops and others.

Tonight at 7, tomorrow at 2 and 7 p.m., Sunday at noon and 5 p.m., Thursday at 7 p.m., New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, newvictory.org; $35, $25 and $12.50.

        <p>Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.</p>
        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>* Asia society: 'ONE WAY OR ANOTHER: ASIAN AMERICAN ART NOW,' through Dec. 10. Taking its name from a 1978 hit by the punk band Blondie, this lively exhibition finds a new vitality and freedom, especially where identity is involved, in Asian-American art. The artists' roots range from Iran to Korea; their mediums include painting, drawing, sculpture, video, photography and performance. Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Roberta Smith)</p>
        <p>Brooklyn Museum: 'Looking Back from Ground Zero: Images from the Brooklyn Museum Collection,' through Jan 7. This show presents a historical picture of Lower Manhattan from early on to the present, with the building of the World Trade Center as the pivotal point. A short film, ''Building the World Trade Center,'' produced by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in 1983, is an invaluable document of the triumphalist spin surrounding the construction of the complex. A small selection of artworks produced in or just after 2001 hints at the profound and conflicted feelings the destruction of the twin towers has evoked. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.(Holland Cotter)</p>
        <p>International Center of Photography: 'Ecotopia: The Second I.C.P. Triennial of Photography and Video,' through Jan. 7. Punctuated by big black oozing forms that are both comic and ominous, this edifying, entertaining, ecologically aware exhibition is a walk-through version of Al Gore's ''Inconvenient Truth.'' The work on view represents nearly 40 artists and photojournalists and portrays nature as variously ravishing, cute and enduring, and also increasingly dangerous and endangered, thanks to the widening scope of human indifference and exploitation. International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Brush and Ink: The Chinese Art of Writing,' through Jan. 21. If painting and writing can be seen as modes of thinking, and they can, then this exhibition is as much a brainstorming session as an art exhibition, crackling with ideas and arguments every step of the way. It is also a sequence of moods, with impassioned voices calling out from the 80 scrolls and inscribed fans that line the galleries, which include colossal examples of contemporary 21st-century art that both depart from and preserve a tradition, (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>* the MET: 'SEAN SCULLY: WALL OF LIGHT,' through Jan. 15. The capacious, day-lighted mezzanine galleries at the Met are the perfect setting for Sean Scully's bold and energizing ''Wall of Light'' paintings from the series he started in 1998. These large-scale oils on canvas wow the viewer with their scale, intensity of color and sheer dominance of space. All have this in common: They are richly painted surfaces of close-laid vertical and horizontal bars (he calls them bricks) whose arrangement suggests constructed walls of stone. Paint disports in the tiny crevices between the bars to give an effect of luminosity. Although they appear totally abstract, with their all-over arrangements of bars that superficially vary only in color, size and juxtaposition, they evoke landscapes, people, events, the work of other artists. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)</p>
        <p>* the MET: SET IN STONE: THE FACE IN MEDIEVAL SCULPTURE, through Feb. 19. One of those revelatory close-ups at which the Metropolitan Museum of Art excels, this show brings together nearly 80 carved, mostly limestone heads, mostly from the 12th and 13th centuries, mostly torn during bouts of iconoclasm from the sculptures and reliefs that turned Gothic cathedrals and abbey churches into Bibles in stone. The treatments of hair and beard with which medieval sculptors were more at ease than they were with, say, eyes or smiles, are almost a show within a show, as, in their own way, are the haunting, seemingly modernist works that look like nothing else here. (See above) . (Smith)</p>
        <p>RUBIN MUSEUM OF ART: 'I SEE NO STRANGER: EARLY SIKH ART AND DEVOTION,' through Jan. 29. Sikhism is the world's fifth-largest organized religion, but how many Westerners know that it was conceived as universalist in scope and radically egalitarian socially? Or that its holy book, far from being a catalog of sectarian dos and don'ts, is a bouquet of poetic songs blending the fragrances of Hindu ragas, Muslim hymns, and Punjabi folk tunes? This is precisely the information delivered by this small and beautiful show. Vivid and concentrated, it presents, mostly through miniature paintings, a kind of Sikh self-portrait, the image of a history shaped by hard work, pluralism and mystical transport, as well as by militancy. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>* The Whitney Museum of American Art: Mark Grotjahn, through Jan. 7. Mining the early Modernist cusp where the figurative, the geometric, the spatial and the visionary still remain tangled, this Los-Angeles-based painter deploys his abstract pinwheel motifs on paper in eight brash, door-sized drawings. Multiple vanishing points destabilize radiating compositions that are variously Op and buzzy, darkly monochrome (and a little too pretentiously moody) or candy-color bright. In some works the motif is doubled and angled, decreasing the shield-like frontality and opening up new optical and spatial possibilities. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)</p>
        <p>The Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Picasso and american art,' through Jan. 28. Notwithstanding the glamorous pictures in it, this is one of those dull affairs incubated in the world of academe: a walk-through slide show that states the obvious. Picasso's ''Woman in White,'' a picture of heavenly arrogance, hangs between Arshile Gorky's ''Artist and His Mother'' and de Kooning's ''Standing Man,'' terrific paintings too. We are meant to register the plain insinuation of Picasso's neo-Classicism, then move on. Next slide, please. The show ends with a virtual retrospective of Picasso-inspired works by Jasper Johns. In picture after picture, Johns buries allusions to the great Spaniard, aspiring presumably to Picasso's own late meditations on Velázquez. Except that even when he was old and running out of steam, Picasso still had joie de vivre. Johns doesn't so much enthrone Picasso as repeatedly entomb him. See above. (Michael Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>Ken Gonzales-Day In the process of researching a book called ''Lynching in the West: 1850-1935,'' this Los Angeles artist assembled an archive and made a discovery: in the more than 350 California lynchings he found records for, most of the victims were Latinos. His photographic show at Cue Foundation is an interpretive response to this fact, largely through altered historical photographs, in which the hanged figure is erased, and the spectators left intact. Cue Art Foundation, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 206-3583, cueartfoundation.org, through Oct. 14. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Dona Nelson The painter Dona Nelson is in midcareer, and her work process is more experimental than ever, on the evidence of the four large pieces in this show. One is made with layers of hosed-down pigment; another is festooned with ropes of stiffened cloth; a third is a rubbing from an earlier painting; a fourth is reversible. In messing around with form, Ms. Nelson lets beauty fall where it may, which makes her art feel exciting and awake. Thomas Erben Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, fourth floor, (212) 645-8701, thomaserben.com, through Oct. 21. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>* RIVANE NEUENSCHWANDER: 'OTHER STORIES AND STORIES OF OTHERS' The New York gallery debut of this young Brazilian artist is beautifully in step with the somewhat pious trend of making art out of almost nothing to circumvent the big, bad art market. In video, collages and typewriter drawings, randomness rules, and the centerpiece makes everyday magic from fans and bushels of bright tissue-paper circles. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 414-4144, tanyabonakdargallery.com, through Oct. 14. (Smith)</p>
        <p>DARIO ROBLETO: 'FEAR AND TENDERNESS IN MEN' Minus the checklist, these works come across as mawkish facsimiles of conventional 20th-century assemblage, 19th-century funeral wreaths, homemade reliquaries or folk art. Their impact expands as you read the lists of materials involved: all kinds of artifacts of American wars, from shrapnel and battlefield dirt to soldiers' letters used to make pulp. But it all remains too visually inaccessible, in addition to being a bit presumptuous about the keepsakes of people no longer alive. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-9460, through Oct. 28. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* SARA VANDERBEEK: 'MIRROR IN THE SKY' Ranging through 20th-century culture, this talented young artist pushes set-up photography and photo appropriation in directions at once worldly and highly personal. By building, lighting and photographing little stage-set constructions festooned with cut-out images, buttons, beads, trinkets and sometimes glitter, she creates poetic, strange amalgams of sculpture, collage and photo montage, and cuts Modernism down to size but also reveals it to be a Pandora's box of ideas. Max Ernst, Paul Outerbridge, Karen Kilimnik and Carol Bove are among the ghosts in these diminutive machines, which nonetheless run on their own steam. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 352-9460, through Oct. 14. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>Guillermina Baiguera and Julian Gatto This gallery has changed its location but not its smallness, which is important to its craft-based, private-feeling, nostalgic-utopian aesthetic. The work of Guillermina Baiguera and Julian Gatto, from little watercolors to hand-size embroideries, exemplifies it. Little Cakes, Little Gallery, 625 East Sixth Street, Apartment 1B, East Village, littlecakes.org; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>'The Filipino Roots of Minimalism: Leo Valledor and Mario Yrisarry' We owe Mitchell Algus for yet another historical rescue with this show of two painters who had a strong New York moment decades ago, then disappeared. Based on what's here, their shared Filipino background was less important to their interesting, and unalike art than the fact that they were both born in the 1930's, were abstract painters in the city in the 1960's, and exhibited at the Park Place gallery, along with Sol Lewitt, Edwin Ruda, Robert Smithson and Mark di Suvero. Mitchell Algus Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, Suite 206, Chelsea, (212) 242-6242; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>* DANIEL LEFCOURT Against most odds, these beautifully made paintinglike configurations of strips of medium-density fiberboard painted black transcend their resemblance to the Minimalist get-me-out-of-painting paintings of the late 1960's. Their variety and needle-thin incised lines add layers of ideas about measurement, drawing and space, both real and illusionistic. They land squarely in the present, where abstraction is neither a dead horse nor a sacred quest, because they are primarily about looking. Taxter &amp; Spengemann, 504 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3540; closes tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>'Mapquest' Elena Sorokina organized this group show for the activist art Web site artwurl.org. Most of what's in the gallery, by individual artists and collectives, is graphics-oriented, information-intensive and, in the current ''interventionist'' way, obliquely polemical. The show continues on artwurl.org itself. Performance Space 122 Gallery, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 228-4249; closes on Monday. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>NEUE Galerie: Gustav Klimt: Five Paintings From the Collection of Ferdinand and Adele Bloch-Bauer  . Klimt's 1907 gold portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, lately acquired by the billionaire collector Ronald S. Lauder, reportedly for $135 million, is now aptly installed like a trophy head above the mantelpiece. She's half queen, half Las Vegas showgirl. A perfect New Yorker. She temporarily hangs with four other Klimts, including a second Adele, painted in 1912: a slender, sinuous, Coke-bottle-shaped figure, more chaste than carnal. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org, closes on Monday. (Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>SARAH OPPENHEIMER: 554-5251 In the latest labor-intensive, wall-piercing installation to treat the gallery space as a malleable object, portions of the white cube have been sliced open and seemingly formed into two enormous tubes. Part tunnel, part basket and mostly plywood, these cut through the space, revealing the storage area and windows normally hidden from view, and requiring some walking in a crouched position. P.P.O.W., 555 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 647-1077, ppowgallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* Mark Wagner and C. K. Wilde Mark Wagner and C. K. Wilde -- collagists, collaborators and co-founders of the Booklyn Artists Alliance -- may or may not make money from their art, but for sure they make their art from money. Mr. Wagner works with green-and-white United States currency, Mr. Wilde with a rainbow of international tender. From tiny pieces of both they assemble intensely detailed pictures of staggering virtuosity, with Mr. Wilde specializing in cut-and-paste remakes of Goya's ''Disasters of War.'' Pavel Zoubok Gallery, 533 West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 675-7490, pavelzoubok.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>ANDY WARHOL: MAO Whoever added the colors and brushwork to Andy Warhol's silkscreen images of the chairman, now 30 years dead, seems to have been having a good time. The surfaces have more life than usual for the master of art-as-business production, even if the show lacks one of Warhol's really, really big Maos. L&amp;M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212) 861-0020; closes tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>ALEXI WORTH: COUPLES A prominent bald head, somewhere between a boxed-in apple by Magritte and the smooth pate of a de Chirico mannequin, dominates several of these quirky paintings, which are as notable for the weirdness ascribed to both representation and human relations as for the discreet formalism of space, scale, tone and surface. D C Moore Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 247-2111; closes tomorrow. (Smith)</p>

Or is he just an actor in a play within a play (2:30)? SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1515.</p>
        <p>'WRECKS' In previews; opens on Tuesday. Neil LaBute is back at it with a new play -- a solo -- about love, marriage and other sources of pain. The movie star this time is Ed Harris (1:15). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555.</p>
        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'JAY JOHNSON: THE TWO AND ONLY' A genial 90-minute entertainment giving Broadway audiences a chance to get reacquainted with the (almost) lost art of ventriloquism. Jay Johnson, the onetime ''Soap'' star, gives a pocket history of the craft in addition to an ample demonstration, with partners including a vulture who sings '''My Way,''' a foul-mouthed wooden tyke, a talking tennis ball and a monkey purveying some of the corniest shtick this side of a Friar's roast (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped biomusical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Constantine Maroulis, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'BIRTH AND AFTER BIRTH' Baby is a bruiser in Tina Howe's self-conscious foray into the jungles of absurdism. Written in 1972, this explosion of the nuclear family appears to be stepping, with cautious exactitude, in the footprints of early Edward Albee. Christian Parker directed the rather stilted cast (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'BUSH IS BAD: IMPEACHMENT EDITION' A musical revue of silly, heavy-handed sketches aimed at Bush-haters (1:30). Triad Theater, 158 West 72nd Street, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'esoterica' Eric Walton's very entertaining one-man show is a mix of magic, mentalism and intelligent chat. He does all three impressively (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates)</p>
        <p>'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'GARDEL: THE MUSICAL' A standard-issue biomusical about the tango legend Carlos Gardel that wallows in melodrama (1:30). Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, (212) 225-9920. ( Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING' Bill Bowers's zestful, endearing one-man show is about his life as a mime, an actor and a gay boy growing up in Montana (1:15). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, off Seventh Avenue South, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'JOHN FERGUSON' This 1919 tragedy about a poor Irish family and how far its members will go not to lose their farm is a compelling, fully realized drama with a cast that doesn't miss a beat (2:20). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'NO CHILD'  Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'THE PAIN AND THE ITCH'  A sharp-elbowed new comedy by Bruce Norris about the indiscreet hypocrisies of the urban liberal bourgeoisie. Some familiar dysfunctions and some more exotic ones disrupt Thanksgiving dinner. Funny but tough to stomach (2:00). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'RICHARD II' Michael Cumpsty plays the ineffectual king who loses a crown and gains a soul in Brian Kulick's middling production for the Classic Stage Company. Mr. Cumpsty traces Richard's worldly downfall and spiritual ascent with affecting clarity, but the production is a little glib and a little bland (2:15). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'SHOUT!' A miniskirted, go-go-booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the showroom of a Carnival cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'SISTERS' Declan Hassett's dark tale of sibling rivalry set in rural Ireland occasions the welcome return to the New York stage of Anna Manahan, the Irish actress who won a Tony in 1998 playing the ferociously needy mother in Martin McDonagh's ''Beauty Queen of Leenane.'' A bit less welcome is Mr. Hassett's relentlessly downbeat play itself (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'SONGS OF THE DRAGONS FLYING TO HEAVEN' Young Jean Lee has fashioned a hysterically funny piece of theater with twisted socio-political power and giggly Korean dancers who would fit right into a Quentin Tarantino movie (1:30). HERE Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 868-4444. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'SUBURBIA' This black-hole revival of Eric Bogosian's 1994 group portrait of losers in Angstville, U.S.A., directed by Jo Bonney, features lively performances from Gaby Hoffman, Kieran Culkin and Jessica Capshaw. But even if you're as success-addicted as Donald Trump, you're likely to find yourself identifying with these characters in the wrong way: They're beyond caring what happens to them, and so are you (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'THEOPHILUS NORTH' Matthew Burnett's adaptation of the Thornton Wilder novel about a young man's not quite interpersonal relationships in 1926 Newport is affable if sometimes oversentimental (2:00). Harold Clurman Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'THE TREATMENT' A new play by Eve Ensler (''The Vagina Monologues'') depicting fraught encounters between a traumatized war veteran and a military psychologist. Fervently acted by Dylan McDermott and Portia, it is an overwrought amalgam of psychodrama and political sermonizing (1:05). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983, impactfestival.org. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'wasps in bed' This Berkshires-to-bedroom farce would make a clever sitcom, if only the authors would face the fact that it isn't really about sex (1:45). Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Gates)</p>
        <p>Off Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'FOOLS AND LOVERS' The idea itself is questionable: let's make a musical about a chintzy wedding based entirely on Shakespearean texts. And the realization does not improve on the inspiration. Andrew Sherman's music perfectly duplicates the aesthetic of a second-rate wedding band, and to add a layer of realism, many of the actors have trouble carrying a tune. All that the exercise ultimately proves is that you can make Shakespeare say anything (1:20). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. (Anne Midgette)</p>
        <p>Long-Running Shows</p>
        <p>* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). New World Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)</p>
        <p>'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)</p>
        <p>'SPAMALOT'  A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans. (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>'ALLENDE: THE DEATH OF A PRESIDENT'  A dry history lesson about the final hours of Salvador Allende, the Marxist president of Chile who died in 1973 during a military coup (1:15). Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 254-1109; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'LEMKIN'S HOUSE' The man who invented the word genocide, Raphael Lemkin, turns out to have an unsettled afterlife in this compelling drama by Catherine Filloux. He learns, through visitations by Tutsis and others, that the international law he campaigned for against genocide may not have accomplished anything. John Daggett is impressive as Lemkin (1:20). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Neil Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>'OFF-STAGE: THE WEST VILLAGE FRAGMENTS' A warm-hearted and well-researched mix of walking tour and performance that offers a sampling menu of excerpts from plays from the origins of Off Off Broadway (2:00). Various locations throughout Greenwich Village, (212) 529-3626; closes tomorrow. (Zinoman)</p>
        <p>* 'SEVEN GUITARS' Life and death dance cheek to cheek in this fine new revival of August Wilson's drama from 1996. Directed by Ruben Santiago-Hudson, and acted with absorbing restraint and immediacy, this is a truly life-size production, which means it is big indeed (2:45). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529; closes tomorrow. (Brantley)</p>

        <p>'ALL THE KING'S MEN' (PG-13, 120 minutes) This second adaptation of Robert Penn Warren's big novel of political and spiritual corruption in Depression-era Louisiana is full of grand themes, good actors (Jude Law, Sean Penn, Kate Winslet, Mark Ruffalo) and lovingly-photographed southern scenery. And yet nothing seems to work. It's a chaotic stew of ambitions and ideas, but in the end neither convincing nor coherent. (A. O. Scott)</p>
        <p>'THE BLACK DAHLIA' (R, 119 minutes) Brian De Palma drains the life out of James Ellroy's take on the spectacularly cruel 1947 murder of a young Los Angeles woman known as the Black Dahlia. The stars Josh Hartnett, Scarlett Johansson and Aaron Eckhart don't help matters, though Hilary Swank is dandy. (Manohla Dargis)</p>
        <p>'BROKEN SKY' (No rating, 140 minutes, in Spanish) Boy meets boy, as you've never seen, in Julián Hernández's sex-drenched, extravagantly minimalist epic. (Nathan Lee)</p>
        <p>'THE COVENANT' (PG-13, 97 minutes) The director Renny Harlin proves that ''Exorcist: The Beginning'' was not the nadir of his career with this thriller about boy witches fending off a nefarious transfer student. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'EVERYONE'S HERO' (G, 88 minutes) Animated in name only, ''Everyone's Hero'' follows a 10-year-old baseball fanatic as he tries to return Babe Ruth's stolen bat. Largely indifferent to its Depression-era setting, the movie is even less concerned with the need for enchantment. But since this is the last creative collaboration of Christopher and Dana Reeve, the movie's sentimental provenance could earn it a critical pass it doesn't deserve. (Jeannette Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'FACTOTUM' (R, 94 minutes) Matt Dillon goes deep to play Henry Chinaski, the familiar alter ego of the great Charles Bukowski, who survived countless benders, brawls, rejection slips, crazy women and soul-killing jobs. The Norwegian filmmaker Bent Hamer directed. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* '49 UP' (No rating, 134 minutes) In the latest installment of documentary cinema's longest-running, most fascinating experiment, the British schoolchildren first interviewed in ''7 Up'' (1964) have settled into middle age. As always, there are quiet revelations and surprises, and ordinary human experience somehow becomes more fascinating and mysterious than any other subject. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'FLYBOYS' (PG-13, 129 minutes) Empty-headed and egregiously polite, this nostalgia trip to World War I is what you'd get if Norman Rockwell directed ''Top Gun.'' (Lee)</p>
        <p>'GRIDIRON GANG' (PG-13, 120 minutes) Set in a California juvenile detention center, ''Gridiron Gang'' stars Dwayne Johnson, best known as the Rock, as Sean Porter, the real-life probation officer who fights recidivism with football. Jumping from heartwarming to murderous, this is a sports-as-rehab movie that wants to have its gangbanging and cure it, too. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'A GUIDE TO RECOGNIZING YOUR SAINTS' (R, 98 minutes) Rough, ragged and full of life, this autobiographical movie, written and directed by Dito Montiel, about his youth on the streets of Astoria, Queens, is a remarkable debut, stuffed almost to bursting with bold performances and operatic emotions. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'THE GUARDIAN' (PG-13, 139 minutes) A veteran Coast Guard rescue swimmer (Kevin Costner) mentors a young hotshot swimming champion (Ashton Kutcher) in this predictable, overly long but nonetheless serviceable tribute to a branch of the United States military that has been somewhat neglected in the movies. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'HOLLYWOODLAND' (R, 126 minutes) A fictional look at the life and downward-spiraling times of George Reeves, the man who played Superman on television and is here played by a fine Ben Affleck. Allen Coulter directs Paul Bernbaum's screenplay, which features a dead-end parallel plot about a detective (Adrien Brody). (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'IDLEWILD' (R, 120 minutes) André Benjamin and Antwan A. Patton, a k a André 3000 and Big Boi of OutKast, play friends living and sometimes singing in Depression-era Georgia. The joint doesn't jump; it twitches and stumbles. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'THE ILLUSIONIST' (PG-13, 109 minutes) This film tells the story of Eisenheim (Edward Norton), a fictional conjurer who enraptured Viennese audiences in 1900 with his supernatural magic shows. A terrific yarn, it rouses your slumbering belief in the miraculous. (Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'INVINCIBLE' (PG, 99 minutes) The latest addition to the Disney stable of sports-underdog movies, ''Invincible'' is the true story of Vince Papale (Mark Wahlberg), a substitute teacher and part-time bartender, who in 1976 realizes his dream of playing for the Philadelphia Eagles. The director and cinematographer, Ericson Core, counters the story's predictably inspirational trajectory with close attention to historical detail and blue-collar hardship. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'JACKASS: NUMBER TWO' (R, 92 minutes) Debased, infantile and reckless in the extreme, this compendium of body bravado and malfunction makes for some of the most fearless, liberated and cathartic comedy in modern movies. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'jet li's FEARLESS' (PG-13, 105 minutes, in Mandarin) Jet Li says goodbye (supposedly) to the martial arts genre with this decent blend of old-school chopsocky and new-school superproduction. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker plays the mad king while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'THE LAST KISS' (R, 104 minutes) Tony Goldwyn's remake of a popular Italian film is thin and clumsy, but nonetheless unusually candid in its treatment of human sexual misbehavior. Zach Braff plays a young man who, on the brink of turning 30 and about to become a father, panics and cheats on his girlfriend (Jacinda Barrett). (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'Little Miss Sunshine' (R, 101 minutes) A bittersweet comedy of dysfunction that takes place at the terminus of the American dream. The excellent cast includes Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano and that national treasure, Alan Arkin. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'OPEN SEASON' (PG, 100 minutes) In this grand-scale animated comedy-adventure about a grizzly bear and a mule deer who assemble an oddball army of animals to fight the hunters, periodic bursts of cleverness and eye-popping imagery, further enhanced in the 3-D IMAX version, can't disguise that it's just another movie full of jive-talking computer-generated animals with little new to say. (Laura Kern)</p>
        <p>* 'THE QUEEN' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Directed by Stephen Frears from a very smart script by Peter Morgan, and starring a magnificent Helen Mirren in the title role, ''The Queen'' pries open a window in the House of Windsor around the time of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, blending fact with fiction. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'SCHOOL FOR SCOUNDRELS' (PG-13, 101 minutes) Billy Bob Thornton stars as an alpha scoundrel who runs a self-improvement course for sad sacks of the sort persuasively played by the film's other lead actor, Jon Heder. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'THE SCIENCE OF SLEEP' (R, 106 minutes, in English, French and Spanish) A bittersweet dream of romance from Michel Gondry. Inventive and enchanting. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'Scoop' (PG-13, 96 minutes) A not especially funny yet oddly appealing comedy in which Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson make like Nick and Nora, but with more shtick and no martinis (or Asta). (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'SHORTBUS' (No rating, 102 minutes) John Cameron Mitchell's ode to the joy and sweet release of sex also manages to be a sincere, modest political venture that finds humor where you might least expect it. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'the WICKER MAN' (PG-13, 106 minutes) In remaking a 1973 British horror classic, Neil LaBute once again demonstrates his misogyny and, worse, his technical incompetence. (Scott)</p>
        <p>Film Series</p>
        <p>J'AIME LE CINÉMA AMÉRICAIN: AGNÈS B SELECTS (Through Wednesday) The French fashion designer Agnès B. reveals a taste for unusual American movies in a weeklong series of screenings sponsored by BAMcinématek.

(Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>MERCYME (Sunday) Like a number of Christian rock bands, this one is known for a kind of yearning modern rock that wouldn't sound out of place on a secular radio station; the band has a following that many secular acts probably envy.

        <p>* WOLF EYES; JOHN WIESE; THURSTON MOORE AND PRURIENT (Tonight) An all-star lineup of noise-rock. The members of Wolf Eyes, from Michigan, once described themselves as ''the Lynyrd Skynyrd of noise,'' and meant it: the group's rumbling, nightmarish clangor is in one sense a straightforward exposition of a kind of elemental rock artistry.

        <p>* PETER BRÖTZMANN AND HAN BENNINK (Tonight) Few modern saxophonists can sound as powerfully abrasive as Mr. Brötzmann, and few drummers can seem as convincingly unhinged as Mr. Bennink.

        <p>STEPHAN CRUMP (Wednesday) As a bassist and composer, Mr. Crump avoids obvious routes but manages never to lose his way, as he demonstrates on his intimate new album, ''Rosetta'' (Papillon Sounds). He celebrates the album's release by regrouping the two sensitive guitarists it showcases, Liberty Ellman (on acoustic) and Jamie Fox (on electric).

        <p>KENNY GARRETT QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Kenny Garrett is a bulldozer on the alto saxophone, which he applies toward blazing post-Coltrane calisthenics, and an introspective artisan on the soprano, with which he investigates East Asian folk timbres. His recent album on Nonesuch, ''Beyond the Wall'' was inspired by the ancient cultures of China and Africa. He'll revisit it with a band consisting of Benito Gonzalez on piano, Kris Funn on bass and Jamire Williams on drums. At 9 and 11, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>DAVID GILMORE (Monday) Mr. Gilmore favors the clean guitar tone of George Benson, but his playing tends more toward an African rhythmic concept and a slippery melodic sensibility.

        <p>JOHN HEBERT'S BYZANTINE MONKEY (Wednesday) This experimental ensemble features the original music and bass playing of John Hebert, along with the contributions of Tony Malaby and Michaël Attias, saxophonists, and Nasheet Waits, a drummer.

        <p>GERRY HEMINGWAY/ELLERY ESKELIN DUO (Tomorrow) Texture outweighs tempo in Mr. Hemingway's drumming, and his compositions reveal a fruitful fascination with polytonality. Mr. Eskelin, a tenor saxophonist, has a predilection for expressive gruffness, but he tends to find the groove even in formless expanses. At 8:30 p.m., Center for Improvisational Music, 295 Douglass Street, between Third and Fourth Avenues, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (212) 631-5882, schoolforimprov.org; cover, $12; students, $8. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>FRANK KIMBROUGH (Tonight) Mr. Kimbrough is a thoughtful and harmonically literate pianist, with equal taste for melody and abstraction. He appears as part of a new Fazioli Salon solo piano series at the Klavierhaus workshop. At 8, Klavierhaus, 211 West 58th Street, Manhattan, (212) 245-4535, pianoculture.com; $20. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>STEVE LEHMAN'S BLUEPRINT TRIO (Sunday) Steve Lehman, an alto saxophonist and composer, favors jagged intervals and surging rhythmic patterns in this working band, with Matt Brewer on bass, and Eric McPherson on drums. At 8 p.m., The Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>TONY MALABY, WILLIAM PARKER, NASHEET WAITS (Sunday) A promising meeting of three accomplished yet restless improvisers, with experience both in and out of the avant-garde: Mr. Malaby, saxophonist; Mr. Parker, bassist; and Mr. Waits, drummer.

        <p>* BRANFORD MARSALIS QUARTET (Tonight through Sunday night) Branford Marsalis leads one of the most athletic working bands in the jazz mainstream, a point of pride he playfully acknowledges with the locker-room photograph on the cover of his new album, ''Braggtown'' (Marsalis Music). The ensemble -- with Joey Calderazzo on piano, Eric Revis on bass and Jeff (Tain) Watts on drums -- doesn't work often in clubs, which makes this engagement all the more significant. At 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $35. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>* BRAD MEHLDAU TRIO (Tuesday through Thursday) The pianist Brad Mehldau recently renovated the sound of his longstanding trio, with help from the powerfully expressive drummer Jeff Ballard. The group's luminous brand of lyricism has survived, but its repertory is slightly more pop-oriented, and its rhythmic tumble more pronounced. (Through Oct. 15.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>PETE ROBBINS (Sunday) The choral music of the Italian Renaissance composer Carlo Gesualdo has recently provided inspiration for the creative energies of Mr. Robbins, an alto saxophonist and clarinetist. His ''Gesualdo Adaptations'' feature a modernistic ensemble of two saxophonists, two guitarists and an electric keyboard, along with bass and drums. At 8 p.m., Bar 4, 444 Seventh Avenue, at 15th Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 832-9800, bar4.net; suggested donation, $5. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>* KURT ROSENWINKEL QUINTET (Tonight through Sunday night) Kurt Rosenwinkel's electric guitar has an airy tone that offsets the cerebral twinge of his compositions, and his rapport with the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner borders on the telepathic. The two musicians are backed by Aaron Parks on piano, Joe Martin on bass and Jeff Ballard on drums. At 9 and 11, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>

Also on hand is the Machito Orchestra, led by Mario Grillo.

        <p>'CARMEN' (Tomorrow and Thursday) Rinat Shaham, who made her company debut as Zerlina, is a small singer for Carmen; worse, the New York City Opera's production seems to have veiled her spark, rendering her a mere stereotype. Her Don José, Mark Duffin, has warm lower notes and a pressed, often flat sound on top; the Escamillo is Adrian Gans, who was too nervous to be judged at his company debut in the role. The high point is Latonia Moore, a radiant-voiced Micaëla who seems to belong to a world apart from this rather pedestrian production. Ari Pelto conducts, a little woodenly but competently enough. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $130. (Anne Midgette)</p>
        <p>'L'ELISIR D'AMORE' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) The director Jonathan Miller updates Donizetti's lively comic opera from a rustic Italian setting to a 1950's American diner in this New York City Opera production. The cast includes Anna Skibinsky as Adina, and Erin Morley as Giannetta (both making their company debuts), John Tessier as Nemorino, Paulo Szot as Belcore and Jan Opalach as Dulcamara. George Manahan conducts the New York City Opera orchestra in Donizetti's tuneful score. At 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Vivien Schweitzer)</p>
        <p>'FAUST' (Tonight and Thursday) Gounod's lush score is back at the Metropolitan Opera in Andrei Serban's staging, now less hyperactive than when it was introduced in 2005. Alas, someone appears to have gotten to its soul before Méphistophélès had the chance: the singers, though all fine, put the drama at arm's length, so the work's intense passions don't quite come through. In the cast: Ramón Vargas in the title role, Ruth Ann Swenson as Marguerite, and Ildar Abdrazakov as Méphistophélès, with Bertrand de Billy conducting. Tonight at 8 and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $375. (Allan Kozinn)</p>
        <p>'LA GIOCONDA' (Tomorrow) Grand opera does not get much grander or more theatrical or more violent than this. The traditional production by the Metropolitan Opera stars Violeta Urmana and Olga Borodina, with Marcello Giordani taking over as Enzo. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; metopera.org; $42 to $375. (Bernard Holland)</p>
        <p>* 'IDOMENEO'  (Tuesday) Those who count on Ben Heppner to sing the heldentenor repertory may be surprised to hear him in the title role of Mozart's 1781 opera seria ''Idomeneo,'' staged by the Metropolitan Opera. But this role of the tormented king of Crete after the Trojan War has heroic dimensions, dramatically and vocally, which Mr. Heppner relishes in his clarion and compelling yet elegantly Mozartean portrayal. Other standouts in the cast include the exquisite soprano Dorothea Röschmann as the captured princess Ilia and the rich-voiced mezzo-soprano Kristine Jepson as Idomeneo's devoted son Idamante. James Levine conducts a refined account of a work he clearly loves. Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's elegantly stylized 1982 production is still handsome and effective. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $275. (Anthony Tommasini)</p>
        <p>'THE MARRIAGE OF FIGARO' (Tonight through Sunday) Now in its 59th season, the Amato Opera continues to stage productions in its charmingly tiny quarters on the Bowery. This weekend it continues its run of Mozart's ''Marriage of Figaro,'' with a rotating cast. The quality varies and depends largely on who is singing that night, but the spirit is often there. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 2:30 p.m., Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200, amato.org; $35; $28 for students and 65+. (Schweitzer)</p>
        <p>'THE MERRY WIDOW' (Tomorrow and Sunday) The enterprising Dicapo Opera Theater has some ambitious productions lined up for this season, including a revised version of ''Thérèse Raquin'' by Tobias Picker, who composed ''An American Tragedy'' for the Metropolitan Opera. But Dicapo opens its season with a new production by Michael Capasso of the frothy, tuneful and worldly-wise Franz Lehár operetta ''The Merry Widow.'' The production will use spoken dialogue that was essentially rewritten by the playwright Wendy Wasserstein. Constantine Kitsopoulos conducts. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 4 p.m., Dicapo Opera Theater, 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-9438, dicapo.com; $47.50. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>'DIE TOTE STADT' (Sunday) The composer Erich Wolfgang Korngold is best known for his pioneering scores for swashbuckling Hollywood films of the 1930's. But in Germany in 1920, at the age of 24, he was hailed as the brilliant and promising composer of a mysterious opera, ''Die Tote Stadt.'' The New York City Opera, which has been a champion of this neglected work, has revived its 1975 production, which incorporates film elements, video projections and scrims to evoke the dreamlike story. The cast, though not ideal, is appealing, and George Manahan conducts a sweeping account of Korngold's lyrically sumptuous and theatrical music. At 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $25 to $125. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>'DIE ZAUBERFLOTE' (Tomorrow and Monday) Julie Taymor's production of Mozart's fairytale opera ''Die Zauberflöte,'' introduced in 2004, did not please everyone, including this critic. But overall it was an enormous hit with Met audiences. To me the production was so packed with nonstop stage effects, so overly busy and so peopled with dancers, extras, gargantuan puppets and kitelike animals of every sort that the fine musical performances by the conductor James Levine and cast took a back seat to the stage show. The conductor Scott Bergeson takes the podium for the Met's current revival. The promising cast includes Isabel Bayrakdarian as Pamina, Jonas Kaufmann as Tamino and Nathan Gunn as Papageno. Tomorrow at 1:30 and Monday at 7:30, the Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $375. (Tommasini)</p>

Tomorrow and Sunday another ensemble -- Naoko Tanaka, a violinist; Masao Kawasaki, a violist; Joseph Lee, a cellist; and Rita Sloan, a pianist -- play Mozart's Piano Quartet No. 1 (K. 478) and works for violin and piano by Mozart and Shostakovich. And on Thursday the pianist Hamish Milne plays Bach's Partita No. 4, Beethoven's Sonata in E (Op. 109) and works by Medtner and Chopin. Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday nights at 7:30; Sunday at 4.

        <p>BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Monday) To start its Carnegie Hall appearances in James Levine's third season as music director, the orchestra is performing the Viennese Schools, first and second, in two piano concertos, one by Beethoven (the fourth), one by Schoenberg. Both feature as soloist another conductor with a wide and ambitious range, Daniel Barenboim. Also on the program is the string-orchestra version of Schoenberg's ''Verklärte Nacht.'' At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $39 to $127. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Thursday) If you think that the Chamber Music Society's usual home, Alice Tully Hall, is too big for this intimate repertory, here's a chance to hear the ensemble in closer confines. Stephen Taylor, the oboist; Jose Franch-Ballester, the clarinetist; Peter Kolkay, the bassoonist; Stewart Rose, the hornist; and Inon Barnatan, the pianist, recombine in various configurations to play the Francaix Divertissement, the Poulenc Trio and Beethoven's Quintet in E flat for Winds and Piano (Op. 16).

        <p>* VLADIMIR FELTSMAN (Tuesday and Thursday) In a surprising shift from his modern piano comfort zone, this thoughtful artist is performing all of Mozart's piano sonatas on a modern copy of a Mozart-era Walter fortepiano. The five recitals are split between the New School and the Mannes College of Music. In the final two installments, Mr. Feltsman will play the Sonatas in F (K. 533), C (K. 545) and C minor (K. 457), and the Fantasia in C minor (K. 475), on Tuesday at Mannes; he will perform the Sonatas in B flat (K. 570) and D (K. 576), as well as the Fantasia in D minor (K. 385), the Rondo in D (K. 485) and the Adagio in B minor (K. 540) on Thursday at the New School.

        <p>BEN HEPPNER/WENDY BRYN HARMER/CRAIG RUTENBERG (Thursday) For its recital series, the George London Foundation pairs established vocal stars with young recipients of the foundation's annual award.

At 8 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Juilliard School, Broadway at 65th Street, (212) 769-7406, www.juilliard.edu; free. (Schweitzer)</p>
        <p>LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tomorrow) The orchestra's Beethoven cycle with Bernard Haitink begins with the Second and Third Symphonies and will continue through the week. If recordings are an indication, these should be honest, sturdy and ultimately winning performances. At 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $35 to $85. (Holland)</p>
        <p>LEON MCCAWLEY (Sunday) This British pianist is active across Europe, but has not yet been heard in recital in New York.

        <p>* ORCHESTRA OF ST. LUKE'S (Thursday) The Bach specialist Mary Dalton Greer conducts the Orchestra of St. Luke's and the New York Baroque Soloists in ''Bach Dialogues for Soprano and Bass,'' the first of three programs in the ''Cantatas in Context'' series, now in its seventh season.

        <p>DOROTHEA RÖSCHMANN/GRAHAM JOHNSON (Thursday) In recital, American singers tend to want to show their versatility (''Look, Ma, I can sing in five languages!'') This fine German soprano is, by contrast, sticking to her home language with an all-Viennese program. She strays afield only with some of Schubert's Scottish songs -- including all three of ''Ellen's Gesänge,'' one of which is better known as ''Ave Maria.'' The program also includes a set of Mahler and Berg's ''Sieben frühe Lieder.'' At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $29 to $42. (Midgette)</p>

        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>* Asia society: 'ONE WAY OR ANOTHER: ASIAN AMERICAN ART NOW,' through Dec. 10. Taking its name from a 1978 hit by the punk band Blondie, this lively exhibition finds a new vitality and freedom, especially where identity is involved, in Asian-American art. The artists' roots range from Iran to Korea; their mediums include painting, drawing, sculpture, video, photography and performance. Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Roberta Smith)</p>
        <p>Brooklyn Museum: 'Looking Back from Ground Zero: Images from the Brooklyn Museum Collection,' through Jan 7. This show presents a historical picture of Lower Manhattan from early on to the present, with the building of the World Trade Center as the pivotal point. A short film, ''Building the World Trade Center,'' produced by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in 1983, is an invaluable document of the triumphalist spin surrounding the construction of the complex. A small selection of artworks produced in or just after 2001 hints at the profound and conflicted feelings the destruction of the twin towers has evoked. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.(Holland Cotter)</p>
        <p>International Center of Photography: 'Ecotopia: The Second I.C.P. Triennial of Photography and Video,' through Jan. 7. Punctuated by big black oozing forms that are both comic and ominous, this edifying, entertaining, ecologically aware exhibition is a walk-through version of Al Gore's ''Inconvenient Truth.'' The work on view represents nearly 40 artists and photojournalists and portrays nature as variously ravishing, cute and enduring, and also increasingly dangerous and endangered, thanks to the widening scope of human indifference and exploitation. International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Brush and Ink: The Chinese Art of Writing,' through Jan. 21. If painting and writing can be seen as modes of thinking, and they can, then this exhibition is as much a brainstorming session as an art exhibition, crackling with ideas and arguments every step of the way. It is also a sequence of moods, with impassioned voices calling out from the 80 scrolls and inscribed fans that line the galleries, which include colossal examples of contemporary 21st-century art that both depart from and preserve a tradition, (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>* the MET: 'SEAN SCULLY: WALL OF LIGHT,' through Jan. 15. The capacious, day-lighted mezzanine galleries at the Met are the perfect setting for Sean Scully's bold and energizing ''Wall of Light'' paintings from the series he started in 1998. These large-scale oils on canvas wow the viewer with their scale, intensity of color and sheer dominance of space. All have this in common: They are richly painted surfaces of close-laid vertical and horizontal bars (he calls them bricks) whose arrangement suggests constructed walls of stone. Paint disports in the tiny crevices between the bars to give an effect of luminosity. Although they appear totally abstract, with their all-over arrangements of bars that superficially vary only in color, size and juxtaposition, they evoke landscapes, people, events, the work of other artists. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)</p>
        <p>* the MET: SET IN STONE: THE FACE IN MEDIEVAL SCULPTURE, through Feb. 19. One of those revelatory close-ups at which the Metropolitan Museum of Art excels, this show brings together nearly 80 carved, mostly limestone heads, mostly from the 12th and 13th centuries, mostly torn during bouts of iconoclasm from the sculptures and reliefs that turned Gothic cathedrals and abbey churches into Bibles in stone. The treatments of hair and beard with which medieval sculptors were more at ease than they were with, say, eyes or smiles, are almost a show within a show, as, in their own way, are the haunting, seemingly modernist works that look like nothing else here. (See above) . (Smith)</p>
        <p>RUBIN MUSEUM OF ART: 'I SEE NO STRANGER: EARLY SIKH ART AND DEVOTION,' through Jan. 29. Sikhism is the world's fifth-largest organized religion, but how many Westerners know that it was conceived as universalist in scope and radically egalitarian socially? Or that its holy book, far from being a catalog of sectarian dos and don'ts, is a bouquet of poetic songs blending the fragrances of Hindu ragas, Muslim hymns, and Punjabi folk tunes? This is precisely the information delivered by this small and beautiful show. Vivid and concentrated, it presents, mostly through miniature paintings, a kind of Sikh self-portrait, the image of a history shaped by hard work, pluralism and mystical transport, as well as by militancy. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>* The Whitney Museum of American Art: Mark Grotjahn, through Jan. 7. Mining the early Modernist cusp where the figurative, the geometric, the spatial and the visionary still remain tangled, this Los-Angeles-based painter deploys his abstract pinwheel motifs on paper in eight brash, door-sized drawings. Multiple vanishing points destabilize radiating compositions that are variously Op and buzzy, darkly monochrome (and a little too pretentiously moody) or candy-color bright. In some works the motif is doubled and angled, decreasing the shield-like frontality and opening up new optical and spatial possibilities. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)</p>
        <p>The Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Picasso and american art,' through Jan. 28. Notwithstanding the glamorous pictures in it, this is one of those dull affairs incubated in the world of academe: a walk-through slide show that states the obvious. Picasso's ''Woman in White,'' a picture of heavenly arrogance, hangs between Arshile Gorky's ''Artist and His Mother'' and de Kooning's ''Standing Man,'' terrific paintings too. We are meant to register the plain insinuation of Picasso's neo-Classicism, then move on. Next slide, please. The show ends with a virtual retrospective of Picasso-inspired works by Jasper Johns. In picture after picture, Johns buries allusions to the great Spaniard, aspiring presumably to Picasso's own late meditations on Velázquez. Except that even when he was old and running out of steam, Picasso still had joie de vivre. Johns doesn't so much enthrone Picasso as repeatedly entomb him. See above. (Michael Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>Ken Gonzales-Day In the process of researching a book called ''Lynching in the West: 1850-1935,'' this Los Angeles artist assembled an archive and made a discovery: in the more than 350 California lynchings he found records for, most of the victims were Latinos. His photographic show at Cue Foundation is an interpretive response to this fact, largely through altered historical photographs, in which the hanged figure is erased, and the spectators left intact. Cue Art Foundation, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 206-3583, cueartfoundation.org, through Oct. 14. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Dona Nelson The painter Dona Nelson is in midcareer, and her work process is more experimental than ever, on the evidence of the four large pieces in this show. One is made with layers of hosed-down pigment; another is festooned with ropes of stiffened cloth; a third is a rubbing from an earlier painting; a fourth is reversible. In messing around with form, Ms. Nelson lets beauty fall where it may, which makes her art feel exciting and awake. Thomas Erben Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, fourth floor, (212) 645-8701, thomaserben.com, through Oct. 21. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>* RIVANE NEUENSCHWANDER: 'OTHER STORIES AND STORIES OF OTHERS' The New York gallery debut of this young Brazilian artist is beautifully in step with the somewhat pious trend of making art out of almost nothing to circumvent the big, bad art market. In video, collages and typewriter drawings, randomness rules, and the centerpiece makes everyday magic from fans and bushels of bright tissue-paper circles. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 414-4144, tanyabonakdargallery.com, through Oct. 14. (Smith)</p>
        <p>DARIO ROBLETO: 'FEAR AND TENDERNESS IN MEN' Minus the checklist, these works come across as mawkish facsimiles of conventional 20th-century assemblage, 19th-century funeral wreaths, homemade reliquaries or folk art. Their impact expands as you read the lists of materials involved: all kinds of artifacts of American wars, from shrapnel and battlefield dirt to soldiers' letters used to make pulp. But it all remains too visually inaccessible, in addition to being a bit presumptuous about the keepsakes of people no longer alive. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-9460, through Oct. 28. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* SARA VANDERBEEK: 'MIRROR IN THE SKY' Ranging through 20th-century culture, this talented young artist pushes set-up photography and photo appropriation in directions at once worldly and highly personal. By building, lighting and photographing little stage-set constructions festooned with cut-out images, buttons, beads, trinkets and sometimes glitter, she creates poetic, strange amalgams of sculpture, collage and photo montage, and cuts Modernism down to size but also reveals it to be a Pandora's box of ideas. Max Ernst, Paul Outerbridge, Karen Kilimnik and Carol Bove are among the ghosts in these diminutive machines, which nonetheless run on their own steam. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 352-9460, through Oct. 14. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>Guillermina Baiguera and Julian Gatto This gallery has changed its location but not its smallness, which is important to its craft-based, private-feeling, nostalgic-utopian aesthetic. The work of Guillermina Baiguera and Julian Gatto, from little watercolors to hand-size embroideries, exemplifies it. Little Cakes, Little Gallery, 625 East Sixth Street, Apartment 1B, East Village, littlecakes.org; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>'The Filipino Roots of Minimalism: Leo Valledor and Mario Yrisarry' We owe Mitchell Algus for yet another historical rescue with this show of two painters who had a strong New York moment decades ago, then disappeared. Based on what's here, their shared Filipino background was less important to their interesting, and unalike art than the fact that they were both born in the 1930's, were abstract painters in the city in the 1960's, and exhibited at the Park Place gallery, along with Sol Lewitt, Edwin Ruda, Robert Smithson and Mark di Suvero. Mitchell Algus Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, Suite 206, Chelsea, (212) 242-6242; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>* DANIEL LEFCOURT Against most odds, these beautifully made paintinglike configurations of strips of medium-density fiberboard painted black transcend their resemblance to the Minimalist get-me-out-of-painting paintings of the late 1960's. Their variety and needle-thin incised lines add layers of ideas about measurement, drawing and space, both real and illusionistic. They land squarely in the present, where abstraction is neither a dead horse nor a sacred quest, because they are primarily about looking. Taxter &amp; Spengemann, 504 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3540; closes tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>'Mapquest' Elena Sorokina organized this group show for the activist art Web site artwurl.org. Most of what's in the gallery, by individual artists and collectives, is graphics-oriented, information-intensive and, in the current ''interventionist'' way, obliquely polemical. The show continues on artwurl.org itself. Performance Space 122 Gallery, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 228-4249; closes on Monday. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>NEUE Galerie: Gustav Klimt: Five Paintings From the Collection of Ferdinand and Adele Bloch-Bauer  . Klimt's 1907 gold portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, lately acquired by the billionaire collector Ronald S. Lauder, reportedly for $135 million, is now aptly installed like a trophy head above the mantelpiece. She's half queen, half Las Vegas showgirl. A perfect New Yorker. She temporarily hangs with four other Klimts, including a second Adele, painted in 1912: a slender, sinuous, Coke-bottle-shaped figure, more chaste than carnal. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org, closes on Monday. (Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>SARAH OPPENHEIMER: 554-5251 In the latest labor-intensive, wall-piercing installation to treat the gallery space as a malleable object, portions of the white cube have been sliced open and seemingly formed into two enormous tubes. Part tunnel, part basket and mostly plywood, these cut through the space, revealing the storage area and windows normally hidden from view, and requiring some walking in a crouched position. P.P.O.W., 555 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 647-1077, ppowgallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* Mark Wagner and C. K. Wilde Mark Wagner and C. K. Wilde -- collagists, collaborators and co-founders of the Booklyn Artists Alliance -- may or may not make money from their art, but for sure they make their art from money. Mr. Wagner works with green-and-white United States currency, Mr. Wilde with a rainbow of international tender. From tiny pieces of both they assemble intensely detailed pictures of staggering virtuosity, with Mr. Wilde specializing in cut-and-paste remakes of Goya's ''Disasters of War.'' Pavel Zoubok Gallery, 533 West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 675-7490, pavelzoubok.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>ANDY WARHOL: MAO Whoever added the colors and brushwork to Andy Warhol's silkscreen images of the chairman, now 30 years dead, seems to have been having a good time. The surfaces have more life than usual for the master of art-as-business production, even if the show lacks one of Warhol's really, really big Maos. L&amp;M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212) 861-0020; closes tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>ALEXI WORTH: COUPLES A prominent bald head, somewhere between a boxed-in apple by Magritte and the smooth pate of a de Chirico mannequin, dominates several of these quirky paintings, which are as notable for the weirdness ascribed to both representation and human relations as for the discreet formalism of space, scale, tone and surface. D C Moore Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 247-2111; closes tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
