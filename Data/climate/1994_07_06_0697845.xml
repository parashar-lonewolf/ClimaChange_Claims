        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It should come as no surprise, as you report in "Space Station Faces Danger From Flotsam" (front page, June 27), that "dead satellites, shattered rocket stages and thousands of other pieces of man-made space junk" are speeding around the Earth, endangering a planned international space station.</p>
        <p>Humankind, since the beginning of its sojourn on earth, has treated the land, the air, the seas and now space as a junkyard. We did not seem to notice when the economy was small in relation to ecosystems and when population density was not so great. But that is no longer the case.</p>
        <p>Global warming and ozone depletion are two other manifestations of the waste problem in space. Hazardous waste is a problem on land, as oil spills despoil the waters. Will we ever learn that waste is something with no place to go? Will we recognize that even space has its limits? Can we change our behavior sufficiently to leave portions of our earth and solar systems relatively unscarred, to the benefit of our children and their children?
