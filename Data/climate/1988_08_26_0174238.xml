        <p>LEAD: Leaders of 23 science and engineering societies today urged the two Presidential candidates, Vice President Bush and Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, to appoint a White House science adviser early in a new administration.</p>
        <p>Leaders of 23 science and engineering societies today urged the two Presidential candidates, Vice President Bush and Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, to appoint a White House science adviser early in a new administration.</p>
        <p>The adviser should have direct access to the President and the move would be recognizing the importance of science, the groups said.</p>
        <p>The societies, representing 750,000 American scientists and engineers, called for an adviser to assist the President in addressing problems like global warming, AIDS, acid rain and technological competition with foreign countries. They said the President needed the best science advice he could get from a scientific leader he can trust.</p>
        <p>''In the absence of that trust, the science adviser is isolated and ineffective,'' the societies said in a letter delivered to each candidate Wednesday. Early Appointment Is Sought</p>
        <p>Dr. Howard K. Schachman of the University of California at Berkeley, president of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, said at a news briefing that the President needs detailed knowledge to help him judge the validity and implications of the large Federal investment in research.</p>
        <p>''To do so intelligently, the President will require a rational means of developing the nation's science policies,'' Dr. Schachman said. ''This, in turn, assumes the presence of a highly qualified science adviser with direct access to the President.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Schachman and two other leaders of the science and engineering communities, Dr. Russell C. Drew, president of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and Dr. Val Fitch, president of the American Physical Society, told the briefing that the science adviser should be appointed early in the term.</p>
        <p>''This would enable the adviser to have a voice in the selection of those sub-Cabinet level positions in the Federal agencies that deal with science and technology issues,'' said the letter. Diminished Status Seen</p>
        <p>The letter represented the latest effort by the scientific community to improve what its leaders have called the deteriorating quality of technical advice to the President. In forums at scientific meetings and at a Congressional hearing last spring, lawmakers and the science establishment deplored the state of advice to the White House. Critics cited as examples the large number of expensive science projects like the super-collider atom smasher and the space station, which have been proposed by the Reagan Administration without a decision on which projects should get be fully financed with research dollars.</p>
        <p>Critics have said the status of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, run by the President's adviser, has diminished in recent years and the adviser, although he meets with the President occasionally, no longer has the direct ear of the Chief Executive.</p>
        <p>Dr. Fitch, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist from Princeton University, said it was time to return to the better days of Presidential science advising, as in the Eisenhower and Kennedy Administrations, when there was frequent and direct access. Most Funds to Military</p>
        <p>The United States is at a competitive disadvantage with overseas economic rivals because three-quarters of the annual $65 billion Federal research and development budget goes to military programs, Dr. Fitch said. Better advice might shift this balance more to civilian projects, he added.</p>
        <p>Dr. Drew, president of Viking Instruments Corporation of Sterling, Va., said the public does not appreciate the role of technology in the economy. He said that through national policies, the Government needs to promote economic competitiveness and work as a partner with industry, not as an adversary, as has sometimes been the case in the past.</p>
        <p>Organizations signing the letter to the Presidential candidates included the following:</p>
        <p>Acoustical Society of America; American Association of Engineering Societies; American Association of Pathologists; American Astronomical Society; American Association for Cell Biology; American Association of Immunologists; American Association of Physics Teachers; American Crystallographic Association; American Geophysical Union; American Institute of Physics; American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology; American Society for Microbiology; American Society of Civil Engineers; American Institute of Nutrition; American Physical Society; American Society for Engineering Education; American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics; American Society of Mechanical Engineers; American Vacuum Society; Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers; Optical Society of America; Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, and National Society of Professional Engineers.</p>
