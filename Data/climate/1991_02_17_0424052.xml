        <p>ALMOST two years ago, when President Bush invited delegates for the first international conference to negotiate a treaty to curb global warming, it was a gesture to convince allies and foes that the United States considered the threat to be real.</p>
        <p>Last week, the 10-day conference ended with a pact that carved the first blazes on a path toward a treaty, but also caused puzzlement over just how committed the United States is.</p>
        <p>Some of the biggest doubters are members of the American delegation, who privately believe the United States should be far more aggressive in combatting global warming but were overruled by John. H. Sununu, the White House Chief of Staff.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sununu maintains that without more conclusive scientific evidence the United States should not commit itself to reducing emissions of carbon dioxide, the principal gas linked to warming temperatures, because that would be tantamount to reducing the use of oil and other fossil fuels and could lead to economic stagnation.</p>
        <p>Some delegates said Mr. Sununu directed American negotiators only to establish the framework for negotiating a treaty before pursuing substantive discussions. As a result, the conference agreed to form two primary groups to write the final treaty, but left unfinished which countries would form the groups.</p>
        <p>The narrow objectives and limited gains appeared to delight the Administration. "The meeting was a substantial step forward in that 100 countries agreed to establish a framework by which to deal with the question of global climate change over the course of the next 16 months," said Michael R. Deland, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality.</p>
        <p>But critics feared that much of the next meeting in Kenya in June also could be taken with arguments on procedural issues.</p>
        <p>"I'm really aggravated at my Government," said Pamela Wexler, a policy analyst at the Center for Global Change, a research group. "They spent almost two weeks deciding to decide and all they came up with is an agreement to keep talking. Everyone's going home empty-handed."</p>
