        <p>LEAD: A dank, sunless morning. A distracted young woman with the features of a high-fashion model (Monica Vitti) walks along the bank of a ship canal. She holds the hand of her small son, pulling him along as if he were a wooden duck on wheels. She is distracted, but she looks terrific, her dark reddish-blond hair set off by the soft green of her cloth coat, which is, of course, couture.</p>

        <p>A dank, sunless morning. A distracted young woman with the features of a high-fashion model (Monica Vitti) walks along the bank of a ship canal. She holds the hand of her small son, pulling him along as if he were a wooden duck on wheels. She is distracted, but she looks terrific, her dark reddish-blond hair set off by the soft green of her cloth coat, which is, of course, couture.</p>
        <p>The woman is surrounded by the waste of an industrialized civilization. She stares at pools of still water covered by oil slicks. The air is heavy with fumes from the stacks of the adjacent petrochemical plant. The woman is as aimless and without apparent direction as the society that has allowed this landscape to come into being.</p>
        <p>The scene, which opens Michelangelo Antonioni's ''Red Desert'' (1964), is so prototypical that it seems as if the utterly humorless Mr. Antonioni were sending himself sky-high. Yet ''Red Desert,'' a portrait of a rich middle class in lost orbit, looks even more relevant today than it did when it was first released.</p>
        <p>It's not because the woman in ''Red Desert'' may be cinema's first victim of the greenhouse effect; for Mr. Antonioni, environmental pollution is only a state of mind made manifest. Rather, it's because it is easier today to look through the brilliantly modish Antonioni images to the terror-filled vacuum beyond, which is the real landscape of his singular studies of 1960's alienation.</p>
        <p>''Red Desert'' will be shown in a fine new color print, struck from the original negative, this evening at 6:15 at Alice Tully Hall. It is the first of 46 films that will be featured through Aug. 26 in a retrospective somewhat grandly titled ''A Roman Holiday: Masterworks of the Italian Cinema From Neo-Realism to the Present.''</p>
        <p>It is an extraordinary show, an opportunity to see the beginning and the middle of the postwar renaissance of the Italian cinema, a phenomenon that more or less began with Roberto Rossellini's ''Open City'' (1945) and ended at some indeterminate date (on which no two critics will ever agree).</p>
        <p>The retrospective is not just a record of a remarkable film heritage. It also presents a kind of condensed chronology of the way in which civilizing concerns shift as a society moves from rude chaos and poverty to highly structured affluence.</p>
        <p>As the Italy of ''Red Desert'' is far different from the Italy seen by Rossellini in ''Open City'' and ''Paisan,'' which will also be shown this weekend, so too are the methods and interests of the two directors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Antonioni's images are elegant, self-conscious, as immaculately designed as the clothes worn by Miss Vitti, the actress who came to epitomize his cinema. The world he sees is one of surfaces, bereft of soul. The Antonioni method is full of care, that of someone walking the edge of a precipice.</p>
        <p>Rossellini, working in a fever of pent-up energy immediately after the Allied liberation of Italy, was thinking in general social terms. These two early films seem as factual as reportage. The narrative style is direct. Every shot is functional. No fancy camera movements.</p>
        <p>No time for introspection. The Roman citizens in ''Open City'' are simply trying to survive.</p>
        <p>Later, Rossellini too would move beyond his social concerns to the psychology of the individual, as is evident in ''Voyage to Italy,'' made in 1953 and starring Ingrid Bergman. Though the shift in focus now looks astonishing, coming as it did only eight years after the seminal ''Open City'' (starring Anna Magnani), the director's method remains as self-effacing as it was in 1945.</p>
        <p>Even Rossellini's switch in leading actresses appears to reflect the director's evolving concerns. For Rossellini, the magnificent Magnani seems to represent a general commitment to society, while the cool, beautiful, Hollywood-styled Bergman represents something far more specific and personal, almost self-indulgent.</p>
        <p>Tantalizing Gems</p>
        <p>This weekend's films offer a tantalizing sample of what is to come throughout the retrospective. In addition to ''Red Desert,'' ''Open City'' and ''Paisan,'' there will be opportunities to see Federico Fellini's small, sweet first film as solo director, the incomparably funny ''White Sheik''; two by Vittorio De Sica, ''Miracle in Milan'' and ''The Bicycle Thief'', and two by Luchino Visconti: ''Ossessione,'' his unauthorized adaptation of ''The Postman Always Rings Twice,'' made in 1942, and ''Bellissima'' (1951).</p>
        <p>The last should be a must-see, not only because it is so uncharacteristic of Visconti's other work, but also because it is so funny. Here is a brutally sharp comedy about a pushy, ambitious working-class mother (Magnani) who enters her undersized 7-year-old daughter in a movie studio's ''most beautiful child'' contest. The result is a hilarious near-catastrophe for all concerned.</p>
        <p>''Ossessione'' is tougher going, but more important in terms of film history. It is often cited by critics, especially in France, as the first example of the Italian cinema of Neo-Realism. Though today ''Ossessione'' looks operatic alongside, say, ''Open City'' or ''The Bicycle Thief,'' it helps one begin to understand the breadth of what is referred to as Neo-Realism.</p>
        <p>Too often the term is simply equated with the cinema of social commitment, or of recognizable ''reality,'' most often about the poor and the misbegotten. If one understands it as meaning ''a new way of seeing reality,'' as has been suggested by some, then it becomes broad enough to encompass everything from Rossellini's first works, often with amateur actors, to the very sophisticated, psychological ''reality'' of Antonioni''s ''L'Avventura'' and ''Red Desert.''</p>
        <p>Four by Fellini</p>
        <p>''The White Sheik,'' in which Alberto Sordi and Brunella Bovo play roles that in later Fellini films would become identified with Marcello Mastroianni and Giulietta Masina, is as comic as it is broad (which is very). It's about the helpless infatuation of a naive young woman from the country who, while on her honeymoon in Rome, leaves her husband to pursue a ham actor.</p>
        <p>Three other Fellini films are also in the show: ''I Vitelloni'' (1953), ''La Dolce Vita'' (1959) and the director's masterwork, ''8 1/2'' (1963). Unfortunately, the festival does not give one an adequate idea of the remarkable journey that Fellini's films represent.</p>
        <p>''8 1/2'' is both an end and a beginning. In it Fellini cuts his last ties to the cinema of real life and sets off into the skies of the cinema of the imagination.</p>
        <p>Just as American film makers were discovering the production values to be found by shooting on location, Fellini went in the opposite direction. Having made his early films mostly on location, he moved back into the studio, where he could exercise God-like control over all the elements, as well as his cast and crew. The subsequent Fellini films, notably ''Amarcord'' and the 1984 ''And the Ship Sails On,'' find an intensified emotional reality in sets that are patently artificial.</p>
        <p>There are other omissions in the retrospective. The show includes Visconti's ''Death in Venice'' (1971), but not the director's earlier, much more significant ''Rocco and His Brothers.'' Omissions are inevitable.</p>
        <p>Unexpected Treasures</p>
        <p>There are also unexpected treasures of the sort one doesn't expect to see in a high-toned retrospective.</p>
        <p>Such a film is Giuseppe de Santis's Hollywoodesque ''Bitter Rice'' (1946), about the lives of poor but beautiful, often partially clad workers in the rice paddies of the Po. ''Bitter Rice'' is not great, but it's a most entertaining film, and it made Silvana Mangano into an international sex symbol.</p>
        <p>Another treat is ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' (1967), possibly the best of Sergio Leone's westerns, though it is not quite as epic as the later ''Once Upon a Time in the West.''</p>
        <p>Also on tap are Pietro Germi's two small classics of Sicilian manners, ''Divorce - Italian Style'' (1961) with Marcello Mastroianni playing a philandering husband, and ''Seduced and Abandoned'' (1963), in which the man who has seduced his fiancee refuses to marry her because she is no longer pure. Whatever happened to Mr. Germi? For that matter, whatever happened to the Italian cinema so gloriously represented in this show?</p>
        <p>Fellini, Bernardo Bertolucci, the Taviani brothers, Ettore Scola and Lina Wertmuller are all still working, though without the excitement exhibited in their earlier films.</p>
        <p>Now, Selling Sentiment</p>
        <p>The difference in quality between then and now is dramatically evident when one compares the performance of the little boy in Giuseppe Tornatore's current hit, ''Cinema Paradiso,'' with those of the children De Sica directed in ''The Bicycle Thief'' and ''Shoe Shine.'' In each film, the child actors are amateurs. Under De Sica's direction, they remain so without affectation that they seem to have been photographed by hidden cameras. The child in ''Cinema Paradiso'' has been instructed to perform in a style that suggests oldtime Hollywood, or early Shirley Temple. Unadulterated sentiment is being sold.</p>
        <p>''Cinema Paradiso'' is a huge hit. Though respected by the critics, the two De Sica films never reached a broad audience.</p>
        <p>Film movements, like people, grow soft. They wear out. The Lincoln Center retrospective recalls the exuberant life that was.</p>
