        <p>So here's an interesting question that you hear around Europe these days: What will the Bush foreign policy be? No, no -- not what was it during the campaign, not what was it for its first 100 days, but what will it really be?</p>
        <p>In case you haven't noticed, the world lately has done for the Bush foreign policy what Senator Jim Jeffords did for the Bush domestic policy -- pushed back. With the Bush team having come into office controlling the White House, the House, the Senate, the Supreme Court and a docile press, there were no internal brakes. So -- up to now -- it has been left to America's democratic allies in Europe, rather than the Democrats in Congress, to provide the counterweight. If one were to put this in mathematical terms: The Bush team came into office advocating foreign policy A. It ran into a world demanding more of foreign policy B. And if A plus B equals C, what will C be?</p>

        <p>So here's an interesting question that you hear around Europe these days: What will the Bush foreign policy be? No, no -- not what was it during the campaign, not what was it for its first 100 days, but what will it really be?</p>
        <p>In case you haven't noticed, the world lately has done for the Bush foreign policy what Senator Jim Jeffords did for the Bush domestic policy -- pushed back. With the Bush team having come into office controlling the White House, the House, the Senate, the Supreme Court and a docile press, there were no internal brakes. So -- up to now -- it has been left to America's democratic allies in Europe, rather than the Democrats in Congress, to provide the counterweight. If one were to put this in mathematical terms: The Bush team came into office advocating foreign policy A. It ran into a world demanding more of foreign policy B. And if A plus B equals C, what will C be?</p>
        <p>For instance, the Bush Treasury secretary, Paul O'Neill, heaped scorn on the Clinton team's ''too frequent'' willingness to bail out key allies when their economies collapsed. Well, Turkey just received a $17 billion I.M.F. and World Bank bailout, including $8 billion in April approved by the Bush team. Argentina just resumed getting its $13 billion, Bush-approved bailout-for-reform package from the I.M.F. The Bushies claim that only I.M.F., not U.S., funds are being used, but the U.S. is the biggest contributor to the I.M.F. Frankly, the Bush team made the correct decisions on both Turkey and Argentina. But it leaves hanging the question: What is its real approach to bailouts?</p>
        <p>The Bush team came into office loudly proclaiming its intention to get U.S. troops out of Bosnia and Kosovo. But European officials say that after listening to Secretary of State Colin Powell during last week's meeting with NATO leaders in Hungary, they felt reassured that the U.S. would not be going anywhere soon, and would generally stick by the NATO principle ''in together, out together.'' Again, it's good the Bush team is challenging Europe to take more responsibility for the Balkans. But no NATO operation will work for long without the U.S. in the middle. Everyone else will drift away, and we can't afford that in Southern Europe. So what is the real Bush defense policy there?</p>
        <p>At the Hungary NATO meeting, the NATO allies, led by France and Germany, refused to bow to Mr. Powell's request that they endorse the Bush Star Wars missile defense plan and issue a communiqu√© saying that the Western allies faced a common ballistic-missile threat. Germany's foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, explained the European position by noting that any missile defense plan ''must add to our security and stability . . . not lead to another arms race.'' Will the Bush team now push ahead on its own or slow down?</p>
        <p>In the Middle East, the Bushies insisted -- with good reason -- that they would not be dragged into Arab-Israeli peacemaking unless the parties were serious. But pressure from America's Arab allies to ''do something'' before the instability spreads prompted Mr. Bush to send low-level diplomats, and now the C.I.A. director, to mediate. Ditto North Korea. First the president trashed the Clinton negotiations with the North. But with both America's European and Asian allies appalled by that, Mr. Bush has now ordered a resumption of talks. How will they be different?</p>
        <p>Maybe the biggest question Europeans will have for President Bush when he comes here next week is: Now that you have dumped the Kyoto treaty as a vehicle for reducing global warming -- which the National Academy of Sciences just confirmed is happening -- what will you replace Kyoto with? The answer needs to be a serious plan, say Greek officials, otherwise it will cause a major rift with Europe's people.</p>
        <p>There is nothing wrong with a new team coming in and saying: We're going to be tougher than the previous lot. Some of Mr. Bush's instincts are right. But there is a fine line between a tougher effective foreign policy and a tougher ineffective foreign policy, with no allies. Clearly the Bushies don't want the latter. But it remains to be seen what their option C is -- where exactly they will strike the balance between their campaign rhetoric and the world of our allies. The Bushies started out with anti-Clintonism as their framework. They are now abandoning that -- but without defining an intellectual framework for their new approach.</p>
