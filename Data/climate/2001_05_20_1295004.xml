        <p>IN every room at the Holiday Inn Campus in Eau Claire, Wis., a sign implores guests to preserve energy by re-using their towels. But Terri Mertz, the hotel's general manager, said that typically guests in no more than five rooms (out of 137) do so.</p>
        <p>''People probably think, 'I'm at a hotel, so they can pay for my towels,' '' Ms. Mertz said.</p>
        <p>Therein lies a lesson for President Bush and the Democrats, who in releasing competing energy blueprints last week each tried to present theirs as the responsible approach to the nation's twin desires for affordable energy and a clean environment.</p>
        <p>Both parties have commissioned polls that show that Americans (particularly prized independent voters) place a far greater priority on encouraging conservation than on producing more oil and gas. Yet there is a huge gap between what people say they want and how they act. In fact, Americans have long resisted taking steps in their own lives to reduce energy consumption.</p>
        <p>This contradiction, ambivalence or hypocrisy could provide a political opening for either party, especially the Republicans, whose energy plan offers only a passing glance at conservation. In the end, Mr. Bush may not suffer politically if, deep down, people are loath to change their lifestyles. The Democrats, in contrast, are asserting that the White House doesn't care about the environment and that its policies would force people to curb their energy use -- or pay higher rates -- not because of any crisis but so that oil companies could reap greater profits.</p>
        <p>Both sides, then, are seeking to exploit an uncertain electorate, an inherently risky game. For Republicans, the challenge is to avoid being seen as despoilers of the Earth; the Democrats need to protect themselves from being portrayed by Republicans as more concerned about championing the spotted owl than people's livelihoods.</p>
        <p>''A large fraction of the American public consider themselves to be concerned about the environment,'' said Cutler J. Cleveland, director of the Center for Energy and Environmental Studies at Boston University, ''yet they also want the freedom to behave in ways that are not constrained by the price or cost of energy. They are outraged with every nickel-a-gallon increase in the price of gasoline.''</p>
        <p>For generations, Americans have been accustomed to abundant and cheap natural resources. Even today, oil and gas are still relatively affordable compared both to inflation and to prices worldwide. This creates a problem for conservationists because, historically, conservation has really worked only when the cost of profligacy has hit consumers' pocketbooks. Thus, the Arab oil embargo during the Carter administration drove Americans to fuel-efficient cars only because gasoline shot up in price and often was not even available.</p>
        <p>For now, despite the specter of rolling blackouts and warnings that gas could top $3 a gallon, most people do not seem panicked enough to change their ways. In California, however, where there is a crisis, two-thirds of the guests at the Westin St. Francis hotel in San Francisco are happily re-using their towels at the management's request.</p>
        <p>Absent a crisis, financial incentives can encourage conservation. If the Holiday Inn in Eau Claire offered a discount for people who re-used their towels -- or even a free cup of coffee -- the response might be better.</p>
        <p>''Any time you ask people to do something new, they have a disincentive to do it,'' said Raymond de Young, an environmental psychologist at the University of Michigan. ''If you're basically telling people that there's no pleasure in what we're asking them to do, people are going to ask, 'What's in it for me?' And they're going to be afraid they're going to be taken for a sucker.''</p>
        <p>American public planning has also discouraged conservation. For example, people might prefer taking public transportation in Los Angeles. But if there are no convenient subway or bus lines, what choice do they have but to drive?  Similarly, people may feel embarrassed about driving gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles, but if the government is afraid of imposing more stringent fuel economy standards on them, or placing higher taxes on gas (which is far cheaper here than in any European country), why scold their owners? In fact, a Transportation Department study made public late last week found that the average gas mileage of new vehicles in the 2001 model year had slipped back to the level of 1999, which was the lowest since 1980.</p>
        <p>If anything, postwar America has encouraged energy consumption, hence the proliferation of highways, suburbs and automobiles, all subsidized. Unlike the Japanese or Europeans, who have limited energy reserves and have had no choice but to do things like flick off light switches, the United States psyche has never been as oriented toward efficiency. The average American uses nearly twice as much energy as the average European, experts say.</p>
        <p>LAST week, a conservation-minded customer brought a stack of hangers to a cleaner here for re-use, and was told, ''We don't do that.'' The store clerk threw them out.</p>
        <p>Amory B. Lovins, a prominent advocate of energy efficiency, said skinny copper wires that carry electricity to light fixtures can be found above the ceilings in many buildings. If fatter wires were installed, he said, there would be an energy savings of nearly 200 percent.</p>
        <p>''It's a subtle but pervasive example of how our market system is not using energy in a way that saves money,'' said Mr. Lovins, who heads the Rocky Mountain Institution in Snowmass, Colo. ''If an electrician were altruistic enough to buy the fatter wire, that electrician would never have gotten the job in the first place because he would not have had the lowest bid.''</p>
        <p>So it is that, while politicians have been competing to be perceived as pro-conservation (a joke making the rounds here is that Mr. Bush is planning to reinstall solar panels that Jimmy Carter put in the roof of the White House), they have taken care not to suggest anything that would spoil the sacred American way of life. No one wants to repeat the mistake made during the energy crisis of the 1970's by Mr. Carter, whose call for austerity left people wondering whether they would find themselves shivering in the dark under a blanket.</p>
        <p>''I reject that term, sacrifice,'' said Gov. Gray Davis of California, a Democrat. ''We're asking people to reduce their personal energy consumption by at least 10 percent. But that is not difficult to do. People don't have to have every light in the house on, every television operating, even when no one's watching and all the computers are on 24 hours a day. That's simply wasteful and unnecessary.''</p>
        <p>The White House has apparently banned the word sacrifice from its talking points. On the contrary, Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, declared that ''Mr. Bush believes that energy use is a reflection of the strength of our economy'' and ''the American way of life is a blessed one and we have a bounty of resources in this country.''</p>
        <p>Those remarks and other by Vice President Dick Cheney, while cheered by the energy industry, made the White House appear so blithely indifferent to the environment that Mr. Bush was forced to dress up his energy policy with conservation initiatives.</p>
        <p>Predictably, this has not satisfied environmentalists, who note that there are few mandatory conservation measures. ''You can summarize the president's energy policy as real men dig, drill and burn,'' said Philip E. Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust, ''and conservation is for wimps.''</p>
        <p>Republicans, well aware that Democrats are widely viewed as more environmentally sensitive, are emphasizing the economy and the consumer. The White House has lined up both conservatives and labor leaders behind its policy to make the point that it would help the economy stay competitive -- and that creating jobs, especially during a time of economic uncertainty, should be the highest priority.</p>
        <p>Implicit in this view is that environmentalism is bad for the economy and bad for the average worker. ''There is a tremendous opportunity for Republicans to discredit environmentalists,'' said Myron Ebell, who is in charge of global warming issues at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a conservative group. ''There is something fundamentally anti-consumer and undemocratic about Democratic coercion to force people to change their lifestyle. The effect of their policies would be to lower the American standard of living.''</p>
        <p>Democrats counter that people have grown too sophisticated for such scare tactics and that there are enormous hidden costs -- health care, toxic cleanups, loss of tourism -- to a policy that pushes production at the expense of the environment.</p>
        <p>''The Bush people are approaching this as a trade-off: either you sacrifice or you dig in the national forest,'' said Mark Mellman, a pollster who has conducted surveys on the environment for the Democratic National Committee. ''The public says you can have both.''</p>
        <p>But can people really have it both ways? Advocates on both sides agree that to successfully grapple with the nation's energy needs and the demands for clean air, water and a landscape not utterly despoiled, there has to be some balance between production and conservation. Finding that balance, at least politically, is the big challenge.</p>
        <p>''We're all guilty,'' said Senator Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat. ''We all want the benefits. But we don't want to make the sacrifices.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 3, 2001, Sunday  An article on May 20 about Republican and Democratic efforts to find political advantage in the nation's current energy problems misstated the period of the Arab oil embargo. It was 1973-74, not during the administration of Jimmy Carter, who was in office from 1977 to 1981.</p>
