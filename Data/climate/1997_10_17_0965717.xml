        <p>For the last six weeks, Jeffrey L. Battiston, the owner of a dry cleaning chain in West Hartford, Conn., has secretly been testing what could be the Holy Grail of his industry: a substitute for the toxic but commonly used cleaning solvent perchlorethylene that he said is harmless to the environment, nonflammable and cleans just as well as perc.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, a company using technology developed by scientists at Hughes Aircraft Company and at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, the birthplace of the atomic bomb, is just months away from a nationwide test of a machine that scrubs clothes with liquid carbon dioxide. And researchers at the University of California at Los Angeles are readying a report showing that dry cleaners who switch to machines that use water can defy industry expectations and clean nearly all kinds of clothes.</p>
        <p>Across the country, teams of chemists, physicists, economists and entrepreneurs are hurriedly finishing off years of research and rushing to sell what each hopes will become a new industry standard for the nation's 37,000 dry cleaning establishments, most of which have relied on perc for decades.</p>
        <p>Propelling that race are mounting concerns about the harmful effects of perc -- which include unpleasant odors, lower air quality, polluted ground water and tainted breast milk -- and increasingly strict regulations that experts say could force hundreds of dry cleaners in New York State alone to close up shop by the end of 1998. The increased concern was demonstrated most recently by the evacuation of a Harlem elementary school that had once been a dry cleaning plant.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mark J. Green, the New York City Public Advocate, requested a new law that would shut down dry cleaning plants in residential buildings if they were cited three times for leaking illegal levels of perc.</p>
        <p>In West Hartford, Mr. Battiston is testing Rynex, a new solvent developed by a Woodbury, N.Y., company. The solvent can be used in conventional dry cleaning machines after minor adjustments, which the company said would cost a few hundred dollars and could be completed in less than an hour. Mr. Battiston said that since he began using Rynex in late August, he had cleaned at least 5,000 garments with the new solvent, without their owners' knowledge.</p>
        <p>''I haven't heard any complaints,'' said Mr. Battiston. ''Two customers called just to say they smelled something different, and they asked me what it was.''</p>
        <p>Several customers interviewed yesterday said they, too, could smell a difference, but preferred it to the familiar scent of clothes cleaned in perc. Ellen Brassil-Horak, who picked up two blazers yesterday morning that had been cleaned overnight in Rynex, said they had ''a very sanitary smell.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Battiston, a third-generation dry cleaner whose three stores handle 6,000 garments a week, said he had no financial stake in Rynex Holdings Ltd., the maker of the chemical. Rather, he said, he agreed to try it because ''it really could save our industry.''</p>
        <p>''At least it could save it from a lot of headaches,'' Mr. Battiston said. ''Let's face it, our industry's taken a lot of heat the last few years.''</p>
        <p>Industry experts remain cautious about Rynex Holdings, which lost credibility after previous promises of a replacement for perc failed to materialize. ''I've got to see it to believe it,'' said William Seitz, executive director of the Neighborhood Cleaners Association-International, a trade group in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>But William A. Hayday, an engineer who heads Rynex Holdings, said that tests were about to begin in two more cities, and that the product could be on the market by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Hayday's invention does not untie the dry cleaning industry's Gordian knot, several competitors are preparing to cut through it.</p>
        <p>In Los Angeles, Robert Gottlieb, director of U.C.L.A.'s Pollution Prevention Education and Research Center, said that a 12-month study of a ''wet cleaning'' shop had shown that cleaning clothes in water is, indeed, a viable alternative to dry cleaning for nearly all garments. Although the technology is several years old, Mr. Gottlieb said, there are fewer than 300 shops nationwide that specialize in wet cleaning -- including the Ecomat stores in New York -- partly because of a widespread industry belief that water is appropriate for only about 40 percent of garments. He said his report would show that perceived problems of shrinkage and bleeding can be controlled by computerized washers and dryers without sacrificing profitability.</p>
        <p>Cleaning ''dry clean only'' garments in water so defies the conventional wisdom among dry cleaners, however, that at least two research groups are working on cleaning processes that would require investments of tens of thousands of dollars by shopkeepers.</p>
        <p>In Raleigh, N.C., scientists at the University of North Carolina and North Carolina State University who invented a detergent that dissolves in liquid carbon dioxide have formed a spinoff company, MiCell Technologies, to bring the technology to market. R. Bradley Lienhart, the company's chief executive, who formerly oversaw production of perchlorethylene at Dow Chemical Corporation, said that MiCell would have its first prototype ready by the end of the year. The machines will sell for about $125,000, he said.</p>
        <p>And in El Segundo, Calif., Global Technologies has licensed a similar carbon dioxide-based cleaning process, originally developed by Hughes Aircraft and scientists at Los Alamos to clean aircraft parts. Jack Belluscio, a Queens native who heads the company, said that prototypes would be ready for testing in five cities by next summer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Belluscio said he had met with officials of the New York State Environmental Facilities Corporation this week, asking them to offer loans to dry cleaners to help them convert to his machines, which will retail for up to $80,000. In exchange, he said, he offered to make New York one of the five test cities.</p>
