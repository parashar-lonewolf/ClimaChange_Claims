        <p>Kim Stanley Robinson is both prolific and meticulous, writing science fiction on a grand scale with an attention to detail few can match. His Mars trilogy dealt with the always thorny, sometimes deadly interface between science and politics. Now, in FORTY SIGNS OF RAIN (Bantam, $25), he takes on an even deadlier confluence: bureaucracy and the environment.</p>
        <p>Nothing is harder than writing about bores without making them boring. Writing about bureaucracy poses a similar challenge, which Robinson works hard to overcome. As in most of his fiction, the main characters are unfailingly nice. Charlie Quibler, an environmental aide to a ''good guy'' senator, is surely alone among science fiction heroes in serving as primary caregiver to a toddler. Charlie backpacks his son Joe to high-level meetings where the dire potential of global warming is thoroughly discussed and then ignored.</p>
        <p>Charlie's wife, Anna, after pumping bottles of breast milk for Charlie to feed Joe during the day, goes to her office at the National Science Foundation, where she and her colleagues sit in judgment on the 50,000 grant proposals received each year. Everyone in the Quiblers' circle is aware of the threat posed by ''what climatologists call abrupt climate change,'' but the only people fully committed to doing something about it are a group of Tibetan exiles who have made their home on an island in the Bay of Bengal, where the risk of catastrophic flooding is far from theoretical.</p>
        <p>This is not the book about global warming on which the movie ''The Day After Tomorrow'' is based, but Robinson does provide an unforgettable demonstration of what can go wrong when an ecological balance is upset. Even without unscientific hyperbole, the floods resulting from weather changes triggered by ''the sudden desalination of the North Atlantic'' are devastating.</p>
        <p>''Forty Signs of Rain'' is the first book of a promised trilogy. Unlike the separate volumes of the Mars series, it doesn't stand on its own. There's a ''Perils of Pauline'' quality to the ending, in which the whole world stares over the abyss, waiting for science to come to the rescue. Does Robinson succeed in making bureaucratic inertia exciting? Not quite. But he comes close to making mathematics the stuff of drama. After noting that developments in pure mathematics have sometimes ''proved to be powerfully descriptive of operations in nature that were either unknown or unexplainable at the time the math was being developed,'' he muses, ''This is a strange fact, calling into question all that we think we know about the relationship between math and reality, the mind and the cosmos.'' Meanwhile, to find out how the Quiblers' world survives climatological calamity, you'll have to wait for succeeding volumes of the trilogy.</p>
        <p>THE ZENITH ANGLE, by Bruce Sterling (Del Rey/Ballantine, $24.95), also deals with bureaucratic foot-dragging in the face of clear and present danger. Sterling, one of the progenitors of cyberpunk, allows his hero, Derek Vandeveer, a computer genius nicknamed Van, to win one for the C.C.I.A.B., the Coordination of Critical Information Assurance Board. A family man whose astronomer wife handles the child care, Van builds a security system -- based on something called a ''Grendel supercluster'' -- to safeguard the federal government's computers after 9/11. ''Grendels,'' he explains, ''are made from obsolete PC's, but clustered in parallel without any von Neumann bottlenecks.''</p>
        <p>And that's just for starters: ''Van was planning to implement distributed streams within the Grendel. That was overkill, really. There wasn't a kode-kid, cracker, hacktivist or even intelligence agency in the whole world that could break into a Grendel. But a Grendel running streams -- man, that would be beyond all coolness.'' This is the way Van talks, and Sterling sees no reason to translate his professional enthusiasms into ordinary English. Indeed, Van's story floats on a Sargasso sea of jargon and bureaucratic acronyms that grows ever thicker as the threats escalate from ''infowar'' and ''cyberwar'' to vintage mad-scientist ''spacewar.'' At some point, even Van can't do his duty within the system, so he goes rogue with some ex-Special Ops to take down a satellite-killing laser.</p>
        <p>Van's adventures inside and outside the Beltway are treated with some amusement, but Sterling underscores their plausibility by dating them from September 1999 to September 2002. Which raises the question: how much of this is science fiction and how much is fact? When Van visits the Cheyenne Mountain Air Force base that commands America's ICBM's, he shares this technical detail: ''The entire base was supported on giant, white-painted steel springs. If half of Cheyenne Mountain vaporized in a 50-megaton first strike, the deep bunker would just bounce on its springs a little.'' I'm not sure about the Grendels, but this I believe.</p>
        <p>In their different ways, both Kim Stanley Robinson and Bruce Sterling place science at the center of their creations. Adam Connell's COUNTERFEIT KINGS (Phobos Books, paper, $14.95) represents another kind of science fiction altogether. Connell wants to write about a future in which people chase around the solar system in spaceships equipped with ''gravity generators in the floorboards.'' The main purpose of these handy devices is to allow enemies to engage in old-fashioned hand-to-hand combat without the inconvenience of weightlessness. A confusing array of rivals for an extraplanetary mining empire keep boarding one another's vessels to slug it out with, among other weapons, simple clubs swung like baseball bats.</p>
        <p>This authorial preference for low-tech mayhem does little to keep down the body count. The hiss-worthy villain, a sickie named Guilfoyle, shares a spaceship with his sister and enjoys masturbation, trashy westerns and hurting people, not necessarily in that order. His nemesis is Horrocks, who makes sweet love to his co-pilot wife but also turns out to be a mean batsman.</p>
        <p>Connell brings estimable energy to this nasty tale, but his ignorance of -- or is it contempt for? -- scientific niceties plays against the very purpose of science fiction, which is to lend authority to futuristic imaginings. He could have set his knockabout narrative in some magic-infested fantasyland, but since he has chosen an arena subject to the laws of physics, he can't just wave a wand and add dollops of gravity at will -- especially when those gravity generators are mentioned only once and figure not at all in the subsequent jockeying for advantage among the no-holds-barred rivals.</p>
        <p>Connell further tips his hand when a robot space-traffic controller measures velocity in good old miles per hour instead of the scientific standard of kilometers. Despite the technological trappings, his narrative is closer to one of Guilfoyle's trashy westerns than to modern science fiction.</p>
