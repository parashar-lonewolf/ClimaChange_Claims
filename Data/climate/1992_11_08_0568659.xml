        <p>GREEN DELUSIONS</p>
        <p>An Environmentalist Critique of Radical Environmentalism. By Martin W. Lewis. 288 pp. Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press. $24.95.</p>
        <p>MANY theologians from the fractious days of the early church are known only from the snippets quoted by their enemies, since their own works have perished. Radical environmentalists get much the same treatment in Martin W. Lewis's "Green Delusions." Mr. Lewis cites only those views he wants to condemn, thus assigning the rest to oblivion.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Lewis presents an interesting analysis of radical environmental credos, provided one can follow him through some fine sectarian hairsplitting. The early church spilled much blood over a single iota -- whether "homoousia" (same nature) or "homoiousia" (like nature) better described the relation between Father and Son. With similar intensity Mr. Lewis, a professor of geography at George Washington University, warns that there exist no fewer than "five main variants of eco-extremism," namely "antihumanist anarchism," "primitivism," "humanist eco-anarchism," "green Marxism" and "radical eco-feminism."</p>
        <p>These assorted brands of "eco-extremism" apparently rest on four essential postulates, which Mr. Lewis defines as follows:</p>
        <p>* Primitive peoples are the ideal model of how humans can live in harmony with nature.</p>
        <p>* Decentralization and local self-rule are the best modes of governance.</p>
        <p>* Advances in technology, and probably in science too, are inherently harmful and dehumanizing.</p>
        <p>* The capitalist market system is inescapably destructive and wasteful.</p>
        <p>Stated thus, the theses of radical environmentalism can be knocked down with less than a book, though Mr. Lewis is interesting in some of his argumentation. He strips primitive humans of their ecological innocence, as he suggests that the first hunters in the Americas, whose arrival coincided with the disappearance of large mammals from the Americas, probably butchered them to extinction. He amusingly takes apart E. F. Schumacher's "Small Is Beautiful" by noting that the "appropriate technology" praised by the late guru "often turns out to mean little more than well-engineered medieval apparatuses." He is also right in noting that new technology is not necessarily more polluting than old technology. Mountains of copper ore had to be smelted to put a telephone in every home, but the optical fiber that will replace it is made only of sand.</p>
        <p>"Back to the Pleistocene" is one of the radical environmentalists' slogans. Why labor so hard to crush a thesis so extreme that it even requires that we abandon agriculture? Mr. Lewis has two reasons. He is abjuring a former faith, since, as he disarmingly mentions, he too was once a radical environmentalist. Readers would have been interested to hear why he once embraced the pernicious faith, as well as why he now condemns it.</p>
        <p>His second purpose, a little contrived, is to counter what he says is the threat of the radical environmentalism. The movement, he asserts in his introduction, has already grown strong enough that it has begun to assault mainstream environmental organizations for having sold out to the despoilers. "It is precisely to defend environmentalism . . . that I have chosen to speak out against environmental extremism," the author explains.</p>
        <p>This premise is surely doubtful. Radical environmentalists are not a potent political movement, nor are they likely to become so as long as the establishment can show that it is responding, however grudgingly, to serious dangers like ozone layer depletion, the destruction of species and the possibility of global warming. Mr. Lewis concedes as much in his conclusion: "Eco-radicalism is admittedly a marginal social movement, its adherents forming an exiguous ideological minority."</p>
        <p>But maybe the movement should not be written off so hastily. A catastrophic failure of the planet's natural regulation could well prompt a broader desire for radical change. Though natural systems are robust, they are not invulnerable to every abuse. The appearance of the ozone hole over the South Pole is a striking example of a global system abruptly deranged by human activity. Ecologists may underestimate the marvelous flexibility of economic systems in responding to scarcity with novel alternatives, but economists also err in assuming that the ecological framework is so infinitely flexible that it can be ignored as a constraint on growth.</p>
        <p>"Green Delusions" offers a lively cascade of ideas, yet makes for dry reading, given the author's preference for the abstract over the particular. Radical environmentalists will doubtless find the book beneficial, but the already converted may choose to skip the sermon.</p>
