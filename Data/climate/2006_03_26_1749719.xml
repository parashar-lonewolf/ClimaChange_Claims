      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>HOBOKEN is adult life with training wheels. As a result, there is quite a bit of turnover in the condominium building where I live. I've waved goodbye to residents headed off to marriage, suburbs, on-site parking garages. But empty-nest syndrome never really sets in, because a new crop of first-time home buyers always comes along.</p>
        <p>There are two one-bedroom apartments on each floor, and in my six years here, I've had three different neighbors across the hall. There was Walt, then Bill and, most recently, Jesse. And though he was a totally nice guy, I was pretty excited to see the ''For Sale'' sign on Jesse's door. First, a woman might finally move in, and maybe she would be single, cute, quirky, well read and a fellow admirer of the films of John Sayles.</p>

        <p>HOBOKEN is adult life with training wheels. As a result, there is quite a bit of turnover in the condominium building where I live. I've waved goodbye to residents headed off to marriage, suburbs, on-site parking garages. But empty-nest syndrome never really sets in, because a new crop of first-time home buyers always comes along.</p>
        <p>There are two one-bedroom apartments on each floor, and in my six years here, I've had three different neighbors across the hall. There was Walt, then Bill and, most recently, Jesse. And though he was a totally nice guy, I was pretty excited to see the ''For Sale'' sign on Jesse's door. First, a woman might finally move in, and maybe she would be single, cute, quirky, well read and a fellow admirer of the films of John Sayles.</p>
        <p>Also, the asking price was $339,900, a 127 percent increase from what I had paid in 2000. What a savvy investor I am!</p>
        <p>Except, no buyers took the bait. No cute women, no ugly men, nobody. Competing ''open house'' signs were ignored. Then the unthinkable happened: The price dropped by $5,000.</p>
        <p>Not to worry. That's still a 123 percent increase. And if the traditional real estate market can't get the job done, I will take matters into my own hands. Which is not to imply that I am going to buy Jesse's apartment, as my pizza man, Benny, suggested. I don't see myself as a tycoon, and I cannot wrap my head around another 30-year mortgage. How can I peer three decades into the future? I don't even know what shirt I'm going to wear tomorrow.</p>
        <p>So here's what I'll do: Use this forum to convince one of you fine people to become my neighbor. Don't wait till the end of the list of key selling points to make an offer. There are people who read faster than you do.</p>
        <p>Walking up four flights is excellent cardiovascular exercise. Perhaps you've ''climbed stairs'' at the gym, but actual stairs are a whole new kettle of fish.</p>
        <p>The building is across the street from Fiore's Deli, purveyors of perhaps the world's finest fresh mozzarella cheese -- though after waiting in line outside in the dead of winter, you realize that Kraft processed mozzarella has its own charms.</p>
        <p>Don't worry about scraping the walls when you move in. Those first-flight walls are already so scratched, you'd think Wolverine from the X-Men lives here.</p>
        <p>Your parents will like me. For that first home purchase, the folks invariably like to check out the place with their potential-buyer child. I am the sort of clean-cut, gainfully employed person who makes mom and dad relax and realize, ''Our baby will be safe here.''</p>
        <p>Wait till you see all the natural light! O.K., I've got a lot more windows on my side of the building, but you're welcome to visit. Anyway, you've got an unobstructed view of people waiting in line for cheese.</p>
        <p>You'll never come home to weird cooking smells emanating from across the hall. I don't cook. Ever. Not even a Pop-Tart.</p>
        <p>It will probably be several decades before climate changes and rising sea levels put all of Hoboken under water.</p>
        <p>I have diverse interests and free time, so I can meet almost any neighborly need. Going out of town? I'll water plants. Want to see that band at Maxwell's but your Jersey-phobic friends won't cross the Hudson? Count me in. Need to borrow a drill to install blinds? I've got one, unused since I installed my own blinds. Wish you had somebody to watch the Nets game with? I'm your man. Hoping to fall madly in love? I will tear down our common walls in a passionate frenzy of zoning code violation.</p>
        <p>I look forward to being your neighbor, and I will miss you when you inevitably move. But don't cry for me. Just 24 more years on my mortgage, and I am out the door.</p>
