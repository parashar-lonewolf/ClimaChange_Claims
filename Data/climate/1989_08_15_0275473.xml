        <p>LEAD: SCIENTIFIC rivals in a bitter dispute over the extinction of the dinosaurs have agreed to a hammer-wielding showdown in the mountains of central Italy next month.</p>
        <p>SCIENTIFIC rivals in a bitter dispute over the extinction of the dinosaurs have agreed to a hammer-wielding showdown in the mountains of central Italy next month.</p>
        <p>Rock hammers in hand, and under the watchful eye of a neutral referee, rival teams of scientists from the University of California at Berkeley and Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H., will chop specimens from the face of a cliff near Gubbio in the Umbrian Apennines. The ''Berkeley Bombardiers'' and the ''Dartmouth Detonators,'' as colleagues have dubbed the two groups, will try to gather evidence both groups can accept regarding the question of why the dinosaurs died out.</p>
        <p>The opposing sides do not expect their highly unusual joint expedition to Italy to resolve the issue, but they hope at least to reach agreement on some important factual evidence. In particular, they will be seeking to determine the distribution of iridium in rock layers of iridium, an index of the time span during which a major geological upheaval may have occurred that some theorists believe killed off the dinosaurs. The distribution of iridium may hold clues as to the nature of that event, which is hotly disputed by scientists.</p>
        <p>On past expeditions by one side or the other, each gathered evidence that favored its own theory, and there was no agreement on even the most basic factual matter. If the joint expedition reaches such agreement, scientists hope, it might cool tempers that have often flared during the decadelong debate, which has involved hundreds of scientists in many countries.</p>
        <p>The main point of contention is a theory that the dinosaurs and many other forms of life were killed off by the impact of a comet, an idea that has been accepted by many geologists. The main alternative theory suggests that the mass extinction resulted from an extended series of volcanic eruptions in India, the largest outpouring of lava and volcanic gases in the past 200 million years.</p>
        <p>Participants in the discussion regard it as one of the most important scientific debates of the 20th century. Scientists from scores of other institutions and many specialties have played important roles.</p>
        <p>At issue is the cause of the mass extinctions that occurred at the close of the Cretaceous epoch and the beginning of the Tertiary epoch, between 65 and 66 million years ago. Scientists refer to this epochal instant in earth's history as the ''K/T boundary,'' referring to the abrupt change in numbers and types of fossils found at this level of the sedimentary record. Geologists abbreviate the Cretaceous epoch as K to distinguish it from the Carboniferous epoch, which is abbreviated as C, and the Cambrian epoch, abbreviated as a slashed C. The Berkeley group holds that the K/T extinctions were caused by the impacts of one or more comets. Its members believe the impact of an extraterrestrial object a half mile in diameter would have started global wildfires and hurled clouds of dust and soot into the atmosphere, blocking sunlight. This would have chilled the planet, altered its climate, choked off the growth of plants essential to the food chain, and disrupted global habitats enough to trigger mass extinctions.</p>
        <p>Opponents of the Berkeley theory contend that fossil evidence from sedimentary rock is inconsistent with such a simple explanation. For one thing, they contend, the dinosaurs appear to have been virtually extinct by the time the putative impact occurred. They argue that the K/T extinctions occurred over a span of tens or hundreds of thousands of years, and are more likely to have been caused by gigantic volcanic eruptions, changing sea levels, epidemics spread by migrations or other possible factors. Illuminating the Future</p>
        <p>In any case, scientists agree, an understanding of the K/T extinctions could shed light on other mass extinctions, as well as on the milder effects climate and oceanic change may exert on living things. Such knowledge could even illuminate mankind's own future in the light of such supposed global threats as a nuclear winter caused by the debris of a nuclear war, the trapping of solar heat by atmospheric gases, depletion of the ozone layer and the precipitation of acid rain with its consequent poisoning of many forms of life.</p>
        <p>The main participants in the expedition to Italy, scheduled for Sept. 11-13, will be Dr. Walter Alvarez, the leader of the Berkeley group; Dr. Gary D. Johnson of Dartmouth College, and Dr. Robert N. Ginsburg, professor of geology at the University of Miami in Florida. Dr. Ginsburg has agreed to supervise the selection and processing of rock samples. He will ship the specimens, unidentified except by coded markings, to laboratories. The Berkeley and Dartmouth scientists expect to join in certifying the analytical results when they are disclosed next spring. Thick Layer of Iridium</p>
        <p>The debate began a decade ago as the result of discoveries by Dr. Alvarez and his father, the late Dr. Luis W. Alvarez, who won a Nobel prize in physics, and their colleagues at Berkeley. This ''Berkeley group'' discovered that a half-inch-thick layer of Italian clay, laid down at about the time the dinosaurs disappeared from the sedimentary record, was extremely rich in the metal iridium.</p>
        <p>Iridium is much more abundant in meteorites than in most terrestrial rocks, so the investigators reasoned that the extinction itself resulted from the impact of an extraterrestrial object one half mile in diameter.</p>
        <p>The impact theory has gained the support of many scientists, and evidence supporting the theory has continued to accumulate. Investigators have found soot associated with the iridium-rich K/T boundary clay, suggesting the occurrence of the devastating wildfires associated with a comet's impact. Other researchers have found what they say is further evidence of an extraterrestrial impact: quartz and other minerals that exhibit features commonly caused by violent shocks.</p>
        <p>But acceptance of an extraterrestrial cause of mass extinctions has been far from universal. Environmental Chaos</p>
        <p>Opposition to the idea has been especially spirited among the scientists who believe that volcanoes rather than comets were the primary cause of the extinction. Dr. Dewey M. McLean, a geologist at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, suggested in 1980 that the gigantic volcanic eruption in India, which produced a lava field known as the Deccan Traps 66 million years ago, filled the atmosphere with so much carbon dioxide and other gases that the greenhouse entrapment of solar heat greatly raised global temperatures. Heat rather than cold did in the dinosaurs, Dr. McLean believes, and the chaotic environmental changes that accompanied the heating would have been ample cause for mass extinctions.</p>
        <p>Dr. Charles B. Officer and Dr. Charles L. Drake, geologists at Dartmouth, became leading partisans of the volcano theory, contributing evidence that the eruption in India had caused a global plague of acid rain, lethal chemical changes in the oceans and ozone depletion in the upper atmosphere, allowing dangerous ultraviolet radiation from the sun to reach the earth's surface.</p>
        <p>One of the many points of contention between the two groups has to do with the distribution of iridium in the sedimentary rock layers above and below the boundary marking the end of the Cretaceous epoch. Different Results</p>
        <p>The Alvarezes discovered the iridium concentration at the K/T boundary when they sampled and analyzed clay and limestone from sites near Gubbio. They found that sediments below the boundary layer - those older than 66 million years -contained only normal terrestrial levels of iridium. The boundary layer itself contained large amounts of iridium. The iridium content fell rapidly in higher layers.</p>
        <p>But when the Dartmouth group collected rock samples in 1987 from the same site it got very different results. The group, actually headed by Dr. James H. Crocket of McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, found not just one point where iridium concentrations were high, but several. They said the iridium concentrations were significantly higher than normal in sediments extending two meters above and two meters below the K/T extinction boundary, layers representing a time interval of about 300,000 years.</p>
        <p>In their paper published last year by the journal Geology, the scientists concluded that ''to account for the iridium distribution near the K/T boundary, intense volcanic activity is a preferred alternative to impact of extraterrestrial material.'' 'Peculiar and Contentious'</p>
        <p>The discrepancy between this result and that of the Berkeley group intensified the debate. In April, Dr. Walter Alvarez proposed a joint expedition to Italy to settle the question.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ginsburg, the referee, said in an interview that many scientists had asked to participate but that to avoid confusion, the number had been limited to about 10. Many others will join in the analysis of the samples.</p>
        <p>''Because of the peculiar and contentious background of this project,'' he said in an interview, ''I'd prefer not to disclose which laboratories will participate. The slowest part will involve a technique called neutron activation analysis, and we don't expect to have results from that until next spring.''</p>
        <p>Laboratories will look for several substances other than iridium in the Italian rocks. One is shocked quartz, found at all the sites around the world where the K/T boundary layer has been analyzed. Analyzing Shocked Quartz</p>
        <p>But some geologists strongly disagree with the contention that impacts are the sole source of shocked quartz. A leading dissenter is Dr. Neville L. Carter, a geologist at Texas A &amp; M University who has analyzed rocks from the moon as well as terrestrial minerals subjected to violent shocks.</p>
        <p>''We can't yet identify any particular volcano as having produced shocked quartz,'' he said, ''but we know from experiments performed at Los Alamos National Laboratory using high-velocity gas guns that the conditions producing shocked quartz depend strongly on the temperature of the quartz at the instant it is hit. At high temperatures, typical of those in a volcano, quartz is much more easily shocked than at low temperatures.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Carter will participate in analysis of the samples.</p>
        <p>The extinction debate, which has sometimes seemed as convoluted as a medieval discussion of metaphysics, has often spawned sharp personal attacks. The late Dr. Luis Alvarez once nettled paleontologists opposed to his theory by describing them as ''stamp collectors'' rather than scientists. For their part, partisans of the Dartmouth point of view have accused the Berkeley group of trying to exclude them from scientific meetings and publications.</p>
