        <p>LEAD: ENVIRONMENTAL scientists in recent months have been faced with a seeming paradox: one group of researchers has determined that the ozone shield, which screens out harmful ultraviolet radiation, is slowly being depleted over North American latitudes.

        <p>ENVIRONMENTAL scientists in recent months have been faced with a seeming paradox: one group of researchers has determined that the ozone shield, which screens out harmful ultraviolet radiation, is slowly being depleted over North American latitudes. But contrary to what might be expected, other researchers have found no increase in the amount of ultraviolet radiation reaching the ground in eight American cities.</p>
        <p>Now some scientists are suggesting a solution to the apparent contradiction. They say people in metropolitan areas appear to have a built-in protection against increases in ultraviolet rays that might penetrate the high-altitude ozone layer.</p>
        <p>But no one is cheering. The protection, the scientists believe, comes largely from low-altitude air pollutants, including ozone, that screen out ultraviolet radiation before it reaches the earth's surface. Another Type of Worry</p>
        <p>The price is obvious. Urban dwellers may be shielded from solar rays that can cause cancer, eye problems and severe sunburn, at least for now. But they are breathing in more smog. ''It turns out that around urban centers, we really don't have to worry about increased UV in terms of its effects on people,'' said Mario Molina of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology, an expert on the ozone problem. ''Instead, you worry about breathing ozone.''</p>
        <p>No one has demonstrated this definitively, but a number of scientists have been gravitating toward Dr. Molina's view ever since the seeming paradox arose a year ago.</p>
        <p>Last February, a team of researchers headed by Joseph Scotto of the National Cancer Institute reported in the journal Science the results of a study on ultraviolet radiation. They measured the amount of biologically harmful ultraviolet radiation reaching the ground in eight American cities from 1974 through 1985 and calculated annual averages. The cities were widely diverse: Tallahassee, Philadelphia, El Paso, Minneapolis, Fort Worth, Oakland, Calif., Albuquerque and Bismarck, N.D.</p>
        <p>Dr. Scotto and his colleagues reported that no increase in harmful ultraviolet radiation was measured at any of the eight cities over the 11-year period. Some showed decreases, but they were not statistically significant.</p>
        <p>A month later the National Aeronautics and Space Administration reported that from 1969 to 1986 high-altitude ozone over latitudes in which the United States lies declined by 1.9 to 4.7 percent, depending on latitude and season. Scientists estimate that for every 1 percent decline in high-level ozone, 2 percent more ultraviolet radiation reaches the earth's surface. The NASA findings therefore appeared to run directly counter to those of the Scotto study.</p>
        <p>Some scientists suggest that design differences might partly account for the contradiction: The NASA study included many more measuring stations and covered a longer period.</p>
        <p>Others say differences in instrumentation, or inadequately calibrated instruments in the Scotto study, or both, might be responsible. The NASA study used Dobson meters, which measure ozone in a narrow column of the atmosphere. The Scotto study used Robertson-Berger meters, which measure not ozone, but ultraviolet radiation in the narrow band of frequencies that cause biological harm. Those meters also cover a larger slice of the atmosphere than the Dobson meters.</p>
        <p>Skeptical experts point out that both instruments can be easily thrown out of kilter. The meters in the Scotto study were calibrated once a year, said Gerald Cotton of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, who took part in the study. But since the results from all eight monitoring sites were so consistent, he said, ''I don't think it's likely'' that any instruments were significantly off.</p>
        <p>A number of other scientists have joined William B. Grant of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in suggesting that urban air pollution - gases, dust and other particles - had screened out harmful ultraviolet radiation before it reached the earth's surface.</p>
        <p>Pollution ''could more than offset'' increased ultraviolet radiation in metropolitan areas, according to the draft of a forthcoming paper on the subject by John E. Frederick, Hilary E. Snell and E.K. Haywood of the University of Chicago. But, they wrote, ''any such extra absorption is likely to be highly regional in nature'' and does not mean that a decrease in harmful ultraviolet radiation is occurring globally.</p>
        <p>Changes in cloud cover could also allow varying amounts of ultraviolet radiation to reach the earth's surface, a number of scientists say. ''Any increase in cloudiness or local pollution will mask or offset what is happening in stratospheric ozone,'' said Robert T. Watson, a NASA scientist who directed last year's ozone study. 'Ozone Is Not the Only Thing'</p>
        <p>''Ozone is not the only thing that can vary,'' Dr. Frederick said. Once this is realized, he said, the contradiction between the studies is easy to explain. Dr. Watson, for his part, believes no contradiction exists.</p>
        <p>Those involved in the Scotto study stand by their findings. And they are not sanguine about the long-term problem of stratospheric ozone depletion caused by pouring chlorofluorcarbons into the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>''Just because the sky has not yet fallen doesn't mean that it won't,'' said Dr. Frederick Urbach, director of the photobiology center at Temple University's Skin and Cancer Hospital, who took part in the Scotto study. ''I'm sure it will if we keep this up.''</p>
