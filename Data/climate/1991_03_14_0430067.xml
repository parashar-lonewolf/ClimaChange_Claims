        <p>Fate's croupier, long accustomed to a loser at my position at his table, has murmured amazement at my recent war and market luck and shoved two piles of winnings my way.</p>
        <p>But Saddam Hussein has made a compulsive gambler out of me. I'll risk all on a bet about the future of Europe -- and try to be the first to break the bank at Pundit's Roulette.</p>
        <p>The 1996 Euro-Union Monetary and Defense Summit will take place in Brussels (only a 12-hour drive through the new Chunnel traffic jam from London) in June, just after the British elections.</p>
        <p>The Brits will have just tossed out Neil Kinnock and Paddy Ashdown, the Labor-Liberal coalition that upset Conservative damps behind John Major in the fall of 1991. The new right-wing Prime Minister, Chris Patten, who swept to victory with the slogan "Maggie Thatcher Was Too Soft," has promised to end the disastrous monetary experiment with the Deutschpound that put British workers in thrall to German bankers.</p>
        <p>From Berlin comes Volker Ruhe, the Christian Democrat who brought Kohl to Newcastle -- that is, who wrested party leadership from Helmut Kohl in 1993, after it became apparent that Mikhail Gorbachev, in giving up East Germany, had handed West Germany a ravenous pig in a poke. Mr. Kohl's lust for unification shifted a capital-gulping burden from the Soviets to the Germans, generating</p>
        <p>Hirschflation</p>
        <p>, stagnancy accompanied by rising prices.</p>
        <p>The only Socialist at the '96 summit talks is France's Laurent Fabius, who slipped past Michel Rocard to succeed President Mitterrand. (Jacques Chirac would not step aside for the popular Lyons Mayor, Michel Noir, to carry the right's banner.) "Socialist" now means protectionist; its regional police is the Delors Corps, an all-European</p>
        <p>deployment lentement</p>
        <p>regiment replacing NATO.</p>
        <p>Most Europeans did not intend the Delors Corps to replace NATO. But the Germans insisted that U.S. troops replace their nukes with nightsticks on German soil, the French demanded a French NATO commander, the Italians preferred a C.S.C.E. framework. The Americans said here's CNN's number, call it if your Sarajevo Process leads to war.</p>
        <p>Yes, Topic A at the Euro-Union Mon-Def-Sum will be trouble in the Balkans. The blank Czechs will have split into the Bohemian and Slovak republics, squabbling with the handful of states that used to be Yugoslavia, while overlapping Romanians and Hungarians will be exhorted to cut out the border clashes annoying Western Ukraine.</p>
        <p>And what to do about the former Soviet republics, with their newly productive market systems? From Yeltsin in Russia to Shevardnadze in Georgia, a curtain of grain will fall from the separated parts of the old Kremlin empire. Although capitalist Poland is reviving nicely, fresh competition from the former Soviet republics is now causing Central European unemployment.</p>
        <p>The French blame the insular Germans for letting that happen; both France and Germany blame Britain for letting Japan produce automobiles in the U.K. that outsell Mercedes and Peugeot on the Continent. Italy says if the Delors Corps, dominated by French and German officers, doesn't station its Italian platoon on Capri, Rome will form a "third defense pillar" with the Turks.</p>
        <p>At this point, the assembled world press will declare the Euro-Union Mon-Def-Sum to be in disarray. Patten of Britain will delightedly concur, but Chancellor Ruhe and President Fabius will plead with the American Observer at the '96 Summit to say something to reunify Europe.</p>
        <p>Vice President Quayle, sent by retiring President Bush to assume a statesmanlike role rather than take on Republican Elder Statesman Jack Kemp in the '96 California primary, will finesse the Democratic candidates Norm Schwarzkopf and Al Gore by calling for burden-sharing in gulf-style war on global warming.</p>
        <p>Such arrant American triumphalism will infuriate the summiteers and reunify Europe against Anglo American domination, at least enough for a Joint Communique and a decent group picture.</p>
        <p>My pile of chips is on the table. I could lose all: if disparate nationalities amalgamate into Europeans, with a common currency and no farm subsidies and with a projectable defense; and if this united Europe persuades America to keep over 100,000 troops in NATO -- then Fate's croupier will rake in my whole bundle.</p>
        <p>If not, I break the bank.</p>
