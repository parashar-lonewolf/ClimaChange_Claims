        <p>POWERFUL PEOPLE maneuver for position," said the outsider Bill Clinton about Washington moments after he was sworn in as the 42d President, "and worry endlessly about who is in and who is out, who is up and who is down." The new man's derogation of clout was in the grand tradition; leaders always resist outside assessments of the jockeying for power that goes on within. King Lear derided the way "poor rogues talk of court news," which he described as essentially "who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out."</p>
        <p>Three months into his Presidency, Clinton was still deriding as a "political smoke screen" reports that "somebody's up and somebody's down." But soon afterward, he had to backtrack: "We think that there needs to be a little tighter coordination here," he admitted, and announced that his chief of staff, Thomas (Mack) McLarty, was being given a second deputy, freeing Clinton's best friend from kindergarten days to give unspecified policy advice.</p>
        <p>We poor rogues talking of court news could tell that somebody was surely up (in that case, Roy Neel, Al Gore's chief aide and an experienced Senate hand), and somebody was at least seen to be down ("Mack the Nice," as the courteous McLarty is known). That was the first public sign that the power lines of the Clintonites were being adjusted to reflect the realities of administering a Government and wrestling with the negative reaction to its surprising early ideological shift.</p>
        <p>A couple of weeks later, after a flip-flop by Christopher and a haircut from Cristophe increased the Presidential nose dive in opinion polls to warp speed, the up-and-downing intensified. Clinton, deciding to blame communications more than content for his plunge, put David Gergen, a Nixon-Ford-Reagan Old Pro, out front and pulled the media-battered George Stephanopoulos in close.</p>
        <p>People -- appointees -- determine policy. The Earl of Chesterfield's idealistic assertion that "measures, not men, has always been my mark" was nicely skewered by George Canning in 1801 as "the idle supposition that it is the harness and not the horses that draw the chariot along."</p>
        <p>The warm desire for diversity and the cold political trade-offs that led to the molasseslike peopling of the Clinton Administration have given way to the force of personality in small meetings and examples of good and bad judgment in public view. The little boxes and dotted lines on a table of organization are shaking down to "guys we can trust and guys we're stuck with."</p>
        <p>BILL CLINTON IS THE first President in American history to entrust the top power positions in his Administration to two people he cannot fire: the First Lady and the Vice President. He could not fire his lifelong best friend, the chief of staff, either, which explains why the selfless McLarty, along with the alter ego Stephanopoulos, were elevated to more advisory positions -- with others being inserted as "the Hammer" or "the Persuader" alongside them.</p>
        <p>Some Clinton watchers thought the disciplinary role -- which Mack insists that he had planned from the start, but that his choice, Harold Ickes Jr. of New York, ran into flak -- would go to Rahm Emanuel, 33, a hard-edged, soft-eyed former Chicagoan with the grace of a ballet dancer who squeezed $100 million out of fat cats to finance the campaign. ("If you had a flow chart," Emanuel says of those halcyon days, "it would be a kaleidoscope.") But he remains the political director, running the daily 5 P.M. meeting in the Ward Room of the White House mess, with David Wilhelm, the Friend of Bill who now runs the Democratic National Committee; Mandy Grunwald, the media maven; Stan Greenberg, the pollster; David Dreyer, the press aide who doubles as a speech writer; Dee Dee Myers, the formerly token press secretary who is now assuming a more traditional, out-front position in briefing the press, and James Carville and Paul Begala, the pop-'em-with-populism campaign consultants, along with schedulers and advancers.</p>
        <p>These are the image-protectors and Permanent Campaigners, trying to figure out how Mike Deaver did it in the first Reagan term and wondering why the Inaugural air has gone out of the balloon. Their goal, as Emanuel puts it: "To make Clinton the first Democratic President since Roosevelt to be re-elected." (Though Truman served nearly two terms, he was elected President once; that means no Democrat has been re-elected in nearly 50 years.)</p>
        <p>At lunch in the White House mess -- first time back since I was a Nixon speech writer 20 years ago -- Mack's soft-spoken, color-free demeanor was broken only once, when he burst into sudden laughter at the question: "Were you the genius who chose April 15 as the day to float the notion of a value-added tax?" I learned elsewhere that the genius was the ebullient Donna Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, who has little to be ebullient about: the health portfolio was stripped from her by Hillary Rodham Clinton and given to Ira Magaziner, a certified Deep Thinker and longtime friend of the Clintons; meanwhile, reform of H.H.S.'s chief human service -- the promised end of "welfare as we know it," in candidate Clinton's words -- was not even given modest financing in the budget submitted this spring. Clintonites say Magaziner is "narrow but deep," his clout derivative but considerable.</p>
        <p>About the only Cabinet member lower on the totem pole at this moment than Donna Shalala is Hazel O'Leary, the utilities executive from Minnesota. She got the job as Energy Secretary when former Senator Tim Wirth's ex-colleagues in the Senate turned on him after his scathing article about that body in this magazine; he now deals with drug-running at State while Mrs. O'Leary presses her nose to the power window.</p>
        <p>Why do I feel no regret in reporting the lowly spots in the pecking order of these intelligent, reputable Clinton appointees? Because it may well help them bureaucratically: the Democratic political consultant James Carville, "the ragin' Cajun" or "Jugular Jim," tells me that around Clinton, "to be down is to be up. You write that I'm in a state of exile, and if Clinton reads it, for the next week I'm the one he has traveling with him. Clinton spots the most vulnerable person in the room and protects that person."</p>
        <p>Such protection is already being given the Interior Secretary. Clintonites go out of their way to extol the loyalty and patience of the former Arizona Governor Bruce Babbitt, which suggests he has lost more than a few internal battles on grazing fees and public lands. If being down in the Cabinet is to be raised up, Babbitt, Shalala and O'Leary are due for a boost -- and in fact, Babbitt is a leading contender for the opening on the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>MOST EXPERIENCED politicians are doing well in the Clinton Cabinet. Henry Cisneros, the former Mayor of San Antonio who wisely ducked the rigors of a Texas Senate race to take on Housing and Urban Development, is considered a persuasive spokesman for the Administration, as is the Cabinet's other Hispanic member, the former Denver Mayor Federico Pena, at Transportation. Mike Espy, the first black to be sent to Congress by Mississipians in this century, was underrated at the start at Agriculture but is thought to be performing well. Not one of the trio can be called a major player, but all have modest places at the power table.</p>
        <p>So does Ron Brown, the Democratic National Committee chairman who solved the Democrats' Jesse Jackson problem, making him the choice for Commerce; although he has a demerit for sponsoring the O'Leary pick (the Energy Secretary will be lionized at the next Cabinet meeting, if the Carville vulnerability theory is correct), Brown has worked out a nice-cop-tough-cop technique with Mickey Kantor, the trade negotiator, on Japan. The smooth Brown had previously exploited Kantor's explosive abrasiveness in the Bush-Clinton-Perot television debate negotiations; together, Brown and Kantor took the vaunted Baker-Teeter-Darman team to the cleaners on debate formats, and hope to do the same to the Japanese on trade balances.</p>
        <p>As the low-key Robert Rubin takes over building support for the North American Free Trade Agreement, a political tar baby, the high-key Kantor will keep the heat on the GATT talks, the world-trade negotiations. Working closely with Kantor and adding intellectual depth and telegenic feistiness to the economic group is Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the University of California at Berkeley economist inclined to apply affirmative action to Japan's trade imbalance. Kantor, at the pinnacle of Clinton Clout last year as campaign chairman, sought aggressively to be transition chief and later chief of staff; after his take-charge bid was blocked by Bruce Lindsey, Stephanopoulos and Hillary, he came back, subdued, to take a lesser role. "Mickey will be in varying shades of In," says an insider, "but he won't be Out." And he won't be blamed, as Rubin is very likely to be, for the rift that develops with organized labor over allowing American plants to "run away" to Mexico. The Kantor Lesson: in a loose, free-flowing, grimly antihierarchical staff structure, where collegiality is a virtue, don't try too hard to get to the top of the heap.</p>
        <p>ONE CABINET MEMBER vouchsafed to me the secret behind Bill Clinton's running of the Executive Branch: "Where power is not delegated, proximity is all."</p>
        <p>She or he (sources who place their political lives in my hands to help compile the Clout Ratings are protected) explained the power lines at this stage of the new Government: the new President brought a small group of loyalists into his White House, filled with a spirit of solidarity and a sense of the gladness of change. Slowly, suspiciously, Bill and Friends fleshed out the skeleton of the Departments with appointees, many of them relative strangers, and conveyed to them the trappings of office but declined to delegate the power to make decisions even about their own staffs.</p>
        <p>For example, when Hillary Rodham Clinton's third and final choice for Attorney General was put in place, Janet Reno soon discovered the A.G. de facto was Mrs. Clinton's Arkansas law partner, Webster Hubbell: in the aftermath of the Branch Davidian disaster in Waco, Tex., it was the trusted Associate Attorney General Hubbell, not Reno, whom the White House consulted. The moment that revealed the distance between the third-choice A.G. and the President came when she told Tom Brokaw she was unable to talk to Bill Clinton immediately after the suicidal fire; instead, Webb Hubbell was the point of contact. Reno got her revenge when she refused to accept the choice of chief of the criminal division from Hillary: a law partner of Susan Thomases, the First Lady's First Friend, was passed over, generating some independence at Justice and not a little ill will from the power center. (Susan Thomases, who retains her clout, should not be confused with Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, whose clout diminished in the wake of her husband Harry's haircutting and travel advice.)</p>
        <p>"Close counts only in horseshoes and hand grenades," goes the adage; not so in Presidential power-playing. Closeness to the President counts for everything -- when power is not delegated.</p>
        <p>GEORGE Stephanopoulos -- "stuffin' envelopes" is the mnemonic, though some prefer Sesame Street's "Snuffleupagus" -- was, in the First Clinton Administration, the third member of the power trio around the President. Not since James Hagerty advised Eisenhower while managing his press relations had a "communicator" counted for so much in a White House, and not since Ted Sorensen served as John F. Kennedy's alter ego had an adviser been so closely attuned to his principal's principles and mind-set.</p>
        <p>In contrast to longtime Friends of Bill like Bruce Lindsey and Mack McLarty, the slight, 32-year-old bachelor came aboard only a year ago, a refugee from Dukakis and Mondale campaigns who had learned the hard way how not to lose.</p>
        <p>At the start, he was the intellectual straw boss, consulted on everything, active everywhere and spread too thin. His judgment to move quickly to deliver on promises to abortion rights groups was well received by press and public, though he got no credit for it; however, his judgment to pay back homosexuals for their support in the first weeks of the Administration was faulted by the news media and insiders alike.</p>
        <p>Ensconsced in the Press Secretary's traditional office, his leg hooked over an arm of the Queen Anne chair, touseled head resting in the corner, Stephanopoulos would dismiss criticism of a paucity of press conferences as "elitist," and moments after that, he would fence with the press corps, gutsily rejecting the premises of loaded questions. A visitor came out of the office once occupied by Ron Ziegler with the impression that Stephanopoulos delighted in what he was doing, and most of the time -- unlike most of his youthful cohorts, frazzled by policy all-nighters, courting exhaustion as a kind of fraternity initiation -- Stephanopoulos found running a country from its communications center to be fun.</p>
        <p>Then the First Clinton Administration came to an end. The communications chief was not along on the trip when the hairdresser, Cristophe of Beverly Hills, recommended by the Hollywood producer, Harry Thomason, blew-dry the Clinton image of folksiness. But he was closely involved in the firing of the veteran White House travel staff at the behest of two campaign helpers: Thomason, who wanted a crack at the White House press-travel business for an outfit he partly owns, and the President's young cousin, who also happened to be the friend of a Stephanopoulos deputy. To justify the old-style divvying of the political spoils, Stephanopoulos -- unwarned by counsel Bernard Nussbaum's aides -- went a bridge too far, eliciting an unusual formal F.B.I. statement of the existence of a criminal investigation; this unthinking abuse of police power for political purpose reminded oldtimers of the Nixon sins. "When Christopher and Bentsen aren't around the White House," said one exasperated observer, "it's 'Home Alone.' "</p>
        <p>From this episode, Stephanopoulos learned that there are some battles that cannot be won, and that some awkward situations called for backpedaling rather than brazening. He called around to those he misled to apologize. "We learn every single day in this office," the roughed-up young man told the press corps in a brief flash of genuine contrition. "We'll continue to learn."</p>
        <p>But when the news media reaction to Scalpgate and Travelgate combined with the deeper political rebellion against the leftward lurch to pound down public support of the new President, the Clintons realized the politics of change itself needed a drastic early-course change. "Communications" and "partisanship" were blamed, rather than strategic policy blunders, and Stephanopoulos took the fall; he was gathered into the Oval Office bosom as "Senior Policy Adviser," where he will lie low until the next turn of the clout-rating wheel.</p>
        <p>He was replaced as the symbol of the Second Clinton Administration (I steal this construct from F.D.R.'s Brain Truster and speech writer Raymond Moley, who divided the First and Second New Deals) by David Gergen. The moderate Ray Price brought David into the speech-writing ranks of the Nixon Administration; he went on to serve Gerald Ford and, when his hoped-for post at the head of Ronald Reagan's U.S.I.A. went to a Reagan crony, became a top press aide in the White House, barring access to reporters he considered "hostile." He successfully crossed the street to magazine and television commentary, taking generally sensible and libertarian positions on the right, and identified the motive for his recrossing as "patriotism." Clinton was indeed on the ropes: his economic plan passed the heavily Democratic House only because, in the Oklahoma Democrat David McCurdy's words, "We couldn't afford to let him die." Time was overripe for a switch to the center; the choice of Gergen represents that recognition of a need to end the leftward lurch.</p>
        <p>BRUCE LINDSEY, the eminence grise around the White House, is the Clintons' confidant, the closest-in adviser; I am told by one of his many nonadmirers that he sought the job of Chief of Staff, but both Hillary and her husband felt he would not be as good an administrator as the other longtime friend, Mack McLarty. Lindsey's consolation was to be given greater access to the President's ear; in addition, he was given the specific task of staffing the Administration with loyalists and an affirmative representation of women and minorities. At first Lindsey tripped over Nannygate, and as a result was cautious to a fault in selecting sub-Cabinet appointees; as one support-deprived official puts it, "Zoe froze the system." But the protected Lindsey, unlike the exposed McLarty, took no heat. He performs a function that Bebe Rebozo performed for Nixon: sounding board for the Clintons' resentments at ill treatment from the press.</p>
        <p>Harry Thomason's clout rating, which had soared to 7.4 after he and his wife, Linda, produced the Inaugural extravaganza, has taken a tumble to 3.7. He can still flash the coveted White House "resident's pass," allowing him john privileges in the family quarters, but the Hollywood set, which began to advertise its clout with "the long hug" of Bill Clinton by Barbra Streisand at the gala, found its influence on the wane -- at least until next fund-raising time.</p>
        <p>AL GORE IS HAVING FUN, but he tries not to let it show. He subscribes to the notion that in national politics, stuffiness is next to godliness, and only lately, and with the most sober second thought, has he begun to lighten up. The Vice President -- grimly obsequious to the President in public -- lays it on the line in private without the formal deferrence exhibited by the Secretary of State or the professorial shuffling of the nation-al security adviser. I ran into him just outside the Oval Office one day, tossed the singles-bar line at him -- "Do you come here often?" -- and was cheerfully told, "All the time."</p>
        <p>I had known him only as the Senate's "Mr. Green," who would trudge over to newspaper offices with large charts to demonstrate why we were not devoting enough space to global warming. Now near the top of the heap, he has extracted small victories for biodiversity and environmentalism from the economic group, which is concerned about the fallout on the job market. Clout is not transferrable, however; though Gore placed his Senate aide, Carol Browner, at the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, she is not regarded as a heavy hitter.</p>
        <p>As a longtime Washington hand -- son of a Senator, eight years a Senator himself -- Gore helps prepare the President for the arcane ways of the capital. For example, before Clinton's State of the Union Message to a joint session of Congress, it was Gore who pointed out that when the President called for change, only half the chamber would rise and applaud, and the speaker at the rostrum should not expect the entire audience to react positively. Seems obvious enough, but that night, Clinton called Gore to thank him for the heads-up, admitting he would have been thrown by the sight of so many sitting on their hands had he not been forewarned.</p>
        <p>More important, Gore is one of the very few willing to beard the lion in his den. Clinton, winging his foreign policy at the start, told The New York Times that he wanted to "depersonalize" the conflict with Saddam Hussein; that was duly reported as a dramatic change from Bush's policy, which had been to insist on the dictator's ouster before relations with Iraq could be resumed. Clinton reacted with anger and confusion, insisting that no policy change had been made. Christopher, testifying to Congress that day, put some daylight between himself and the President's blunder, and Tony Lake, the scholarly national security adviser, is not the sort to storm into the Oval Office to straighten out a petulant President. It took Al Gore, shirt-sleeved but somber, to go in and say he would go on a talk show the next day to wrench the position back into line. Clinton agreed to let Gore "walk back the cat." Later, the lawyerly Secretary of State found a way of making Clinton's dovish "de-personalize" seem even more hawkish on Saddam than Bush had been -- by welcoming Kurdish leaders to Washington and telling them that it meant that only a true democratic replacement for Saddam, and not some successor Iraqi thug, would be acceptable to the United States.</p>
        <p>Who swings the most weight with Clinton in the formulation of foreign policy? So far, there have been two big decisions -- one easy, one hard. The easy one was to back strongly Boris Yeltsin and his reformers in Russia, as Richard Nixon was urging and as George Bush had failed to do. Strobe Talbott, the former Time columnist who was a Clinton chum at Oxford and now has the former Soviet Union portfolio at State, pressed for a summit embrace. Tony Lake deferred to his judgment in this area: "Tony is spooked by Talbott," mutters an N.S.C. colleague. A political honcho said, "We couldn't save Wyche Fowler in Georgia; how are we gonna save Yeltsin?" Secretary of State Christopher (who must suspect Talbott covets his job) was cautious as usual but leaning toward giving Yeltsin a world spotlight before his referendum. Defense Secretary Les Aspin (who must suspect Jim Woolsey, the C.I.A. director, covets his job) is a mature Washington hand and a possible distance runner, if his health holds up; Aspin and Gore were outspokenly for it. Clinton then arranged to see Nixon, who had been rebuffed when he tried to get Bush to support the reformers, and who showed the new President how foreign aid could be presented as a palatable way to protect planned defense cuts. Clinton came down cleanly for Yeltsin, and picked up deserved credit when the reformers won the referendum.</p>
        <p>Bosnia was the hard one. When the Munich analogy clashed with the Vietnam syndrome, Clinton's National Security Council split. Tony Lake, Les Aspin and United Nations Ambassador Madeleine Albright were the hawks; Christopher and Gen. Colin Powell (soon to retire and be replaced as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs by an airman, with more faith in bombing) were the doves. Gore was not usually identified as taking a point of view, because he would have to be out front selling whatever Clinton decided, but I'm told that in advising the President, Gore "took an aggressive posture."</p>
        <p>After the television pictures of the siege of Srebrenica pushed editorial and some public opinion toward intervention, Clinton let it be known he favored fairly hawkish allied action: "lift and strike," lifting the United Nations embargo that kept arms from Bosnian Muslims and air strikes to suppress Serbian artillery and cut supply lines. Like Bush during the televised flight of terrified Kurds from the wrath of Saddam Hussein, Clinton had been swayed by the widespread revulsion at the slaughter of civilians -- but not swayed enough to take the leadership required for action.</p>
        <p>Clinton first made certain the world knew the United States would not go this alone, in effect giving the Europeans a veto over any American plan; that was his first mistake. His next was to dispatch Christopher to Europe to "consult" with Britain and France, which wanted no action beyond economic sanctions.</p>
        <p>Christopher interpreted Clinton's words as instruction to actually consult -- which in this case meant to bring back an answer of "no." The tip-off came in Brussels, when Manfred Worner, the NATO Secretary General, told Christopher he was ready to convene a meeting of allied ambassadors at which NATO would firmly support joint action. If Christopher wanted a "yes" to take home, he would have jumped at the opportunity; instead, President Clinton's man turned the NATO meeting down. Then, one by one, he made what British Prime Minister John Major told associates was a "bloodless" presentation to the major allies. Christopher returned not with the grudging approval of the allies, as Clinton had hoped, but with a convenient "out"; gutless Europe, not the courageous American President, was to blame.</p>
        <p>Frankly, I thought at the time that Clinton must have sent his Secretary of State to Europe with the mission of being turned down, but I am assured that the President was sincere in wanting to coerce the Serbs into a cease-fire and was knocked off-course by his Secretary's ineptness.</p>
        <p>What happened to Christopher's clout rating? Amazingly, it went up; Clinton has exhibited no irritation, publicly or privately, with the failure of his Secretary of State to carry out his mission. On the contrary, the make-the-most-of-it President nearly boasted of a decision to refuse to "go it alone." Sixth-floor professionals at State may be sick at heart, and seventh-floor political appointees, like Under Secretary Peter Tarnoff, may be rebuked when they blurt out a too-poor-to-lead policy, but the Clintons were drawn closer to "Chris" by his first diplomatic fiasco.</p>
        <p>THE NATIONAL Economic Council is a bureaucratic counterpart to the National Security Council. This new power center was created to show the public that in the new era, economic policy would be at least as high a priority as national security; more important, it moves the center of gravity on economic policy away from the Treasury and into the White House.</p>
        <p>The President and Hillary's choice to head the council was Robert Rubin, a New York investment banker who, at 54, had risen to the top of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company. He knew Mickey Kantor from his years as a Democratic fund-raiser, which brought him into the Clinton economic inner circle during the campaign. Rubin was also a longtime friend of Lloyd Bentsen's, and had served as trustee of the Texas Senator's blind trust; each man had recommended the other to be Treasury Secretary, although Bentsen subtly made it known he really wanted that role as the principal spokesman for economic policy. Rubin dutifully settled for Mr. Inside; because he has no aspirations for elective office and no need to top last year's $26 million income, he is content to have the President's economic ear. The council is too big; Clinton let every Cabinet officer sit on it who asked to, but Rubin gets around that time-wasting expansiveness by breaking it down into subcouncils.</p>
        <p>Here's an example of how Rubin's operation works: A hardball strategy, devised by Howard Paster, a legislative aide, to ram a "stimulus" package through the Senate, succeeded only in uniting Republicans in opposition; a filibuster organized by Bob Dole shifted the issue from "job creation" to "pork." The first legislative defeat of a Clinton initiative encouraged Ross Perot to go public with his objections to a failure to cut spending, and it became apparent that the entire Clinton plan to sell a historic tax increase by calling it budget reduction was in trouble. Pollster Greenberg, in the 5 P.M. Ward Room meeting, confirmed that the public did not trust Clinton to use the new money to sop up red ink. The poor rogues reporting court news were prepared to consign the economic plan to a "crisis of confidence."</p>
        <p>Bentsen, a Texas patrician with a moderate image -- and at 72, the Grand Old Man of the Clinton Administration -- had Rubin convene a meeting of a portion of the council in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. The G.O.M., who had absented himself from heavy lobbying on the losing stimulus plan, liked the idea being pressed by Representative Charles Schumer of New York to create a "trust fund" in which new tax money would go, earmarked for reducing the deficit. Never mind that Democrats had denounced a similar "tax-return checkoff" proposal made the year before by President Bush as a feckless gimmick; the public wanted ironclad assurances that new taxes would not be diverted to new spending, and Bentsen felt the idea's time had come.</p>
        <p>Leon Panetta, director of the Office of Management and Budget, was all for it. Panetta has long been a Washington maverick: I remember him from the Nixon Health, Education and Welfare Department, where he ran the Office of Civil Rights and angrily quit to co-write a book entitled in sarcasm "Bring Us Together." A generation ago, he switched parties, won a seat in Congress and ultimately became the Democrats' leading House budgeteer; when the didactic Alice Rivlin bored Bill Clinton stiff in a job interview -- "she's more loyal to cutting the deficit than to the Clintons" was one assessment -- the faithful, good-humored Panetta won the top job at the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
        <p>Panetta saw the "trust fund" idea as a way of enforcing fiscal discipline. For months, he had been losing this battle; in the formulation of the economic plan, his pleas for $2 in spending cuts for every $1 in tax increases were countered inside the economic council by the passionate, articulate arguments of Robert Reich. That Harvard political economist, rewarded with the Labor secretaryship for his years of loyal Friend-of-Billhood, is an unabashed spender on (in his preferred term, investor in) Government programs to train workers and finance the creation of jobs. In the early planning, Reich urged taxation for new spending; Panetta wanted to use most of the new tax money for deficit reduction; Bentsen was in the middle. Rubin, inexperienced in politics and focused on the impact of the promise of deficit reduction on interest rates and the bond markets, came down on the side of Reich.</p>
        <p>In the trust-fund meeting, Reich again pressed the liberal side, arguing against the fund because it might turn out to be more than a gimmick and might hamstring the spending necessary to train a new work force. But the climate had changed; Stephanopoulos sided with Bentsen, who felt the President now needed to present to suspicious taxpayers some sort of anti-deficit guarantee. Reich then asked for a parallel "investment trust fund," to set aside money saved by spending cuts in defense for his training programs; that didn't fly. Rubin made the decision by asking his deputy, Gene Sperling, to do the paper work to make sure the fund would not unduly tie the Administration's hands. Next morning, in a 15-minute meeting with the President, the pros and cons of a trust fund were presented and Clinton chose the pro. The fund was in a speech the next day. Then Alice Rivlin shrugged it off as mere "display" and had to be told to get with the program.</p>
        <p>THE HILLARY FACTOR is pervasive. She has apparently decided that health will be to the Clinton Administration as Social Security was to F.D.R., as highways were to Eisenhower -- the lasting legacy to show that one couple can make a difference.</p>
        <p>The most severe internal struggle so far has been the fitting of health reform into the budget package. Leon Panetta urged that first things should come first: agreement with Congress on taxing and spending for this fiscal year, with the second bite -- the health plan with its accompanying taxation -- coming in the fall. Hillary disagreed; she insisted that the health reformation come close on the heels of the budget, while the Clinton mandate was still fresh.</p>
        <p>She lost that one. But she won on the economic plan, tilting it toward Reich and away from Panetta, and her influence is felt in most of the Administration's appointments. Did she have an input on Bosnia? She expresses no position on foreign affairs, but as several insiders say, in the same words, "They talk about everything." The First Lady -- with so much at stake in her health reform, and with a more focused mind than her husband -- was said to exert her influence on the side of letting the Bosnians down and concentrating on America.</p>
        <p>That's why, in the current indexation, she outclouts 'em all. Clinton staff members, who tend to absolve the President of blame with the traditional "if the Czar only knew," say the mistakes made in recent months would have been minimized "if only Hillary were here" and not occupied with the health task force.</p>
        <p>But just as a nonpartisan face was being put on the Second Clinton Administration, there was Hillary making a fiercely partisan speech against the "special interests" among the health care providers. As the President pulls in his spending horns, the First Lady, with more clout than anybody, presses for the heavier spending option in the health plan.</p>
        <p>It's not easy to keep up, but to cloutologists, turbulence has its attractions. WILLIAM SAFIRE'S CLOUT RATINGS William Safire's Clout Scale, used here for the first time to rate the political influence of members of the Clinton Administration, is based on criteria pioneered by the developer of the Richter scale to measure seismic disturbances and the Saffir-Simpson scale to measure the force of hurricanes.</p>
        <p>On a scale of 0 to 10 -- with 0 indicating total political impotence and 10 signifying Undisputed Leader of the Free World, a rating automatically given a new President -- cloutologists give Administration members numerical ratings based on the sum of these criteria: (a) job title (with 5 for the top four Cabinet positions and the Chief of Staff, 3 for minor Cabinet posts and National Security Adviser, 1 for Veterans Affairs, .5 for Environmental Protection Agency, etc); (b) proximity to the President's ear (up to 7 for Closest Adviser); (c) quality of intellect and force of personality during internal struggles; (d) ability to sell the President's programs on television or through deep-backgrounders; (e) longtime F.O.B. status; (f) political savvy, and (g) last-minute secret weighting by the author to reflect irritation at inaccessibility or salivation at the potential of future leaks.</p>
