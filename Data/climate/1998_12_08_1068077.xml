        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>RUSSIA: FINANCIAL WOES PERSIST  The arrival of a World Bank team for more talks about loans did little to assuage fears that Russia will be left without foreign aid and may begin printing large sums of money to pay off a total foreign currency debt of $158.8 billion by January.</p>

        <p>BRITAIN: TORY BACKS DOWN ON KEY PLAN  William Hague, the leader of Britain's Conservatives, has abandoned plans to press for a new regional Parliament to represent England. The proposal, a centerpiece of his program at the annual party convention two months ago, was aimed at being a counterweight to the new Parliaments that the Labor Government of Prime Minister Tony Blair has created in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.</p>

        <p>GERMANY: CALL FOR EAST GERMAN AMNESTY  Leaders of the Party of Democratic Socialism, successor to the Communists who governed the former East Germany, have called for an amnesty on crimes committed under Communist rule. The party's leader, Lothar Bisby, questioned whether people carrying out the law of East Germany, from border guards upward, should be liable to prosecution. Nearly 1,000 people were killed trying to flee to the West.</p>

        <p>IRAN: KHATAMI SPEAKS OUT ON REFORMS  President Mohammad Khatami, who was elected last year on promises of ushering in political reforms, accused conservative and traditionalist forces of blocking reforms in Iran. ''We are facing the three currents of counter-revolution, traditionalists hostile to progressive religion and revisionists,'' he told an assembly hall packed with 10,000 student supporters at Sharif University, Teheran.</p>

        <p>EGYPT: MOVE ON MINI-MOSQUES  The Ministry of Religious Endowments said it began putting into action a plan to control 6,000 ''zawya,'' or mini-mosques, in an attempt to put an end to Muslim fundamentalism. The ministry will appoint prayer leaders to the mosques, a spokesman said.</p>

        <p>CHINA: ACID RAIN DAMAGE GROWS  China's rapid economic growth and reliance on coal have spread acid rain damage to 40 percent of the country, The China Daily reported. According to a new report by Chinese scientists, China emitted 23.5 million tons of sulfur dioxide last year, up 30 percent from 1993, and coal use doubled to comprise 75 percent of total energy consumption.</p>

        <p>NORTH KOREA: TALKS WITH U.S. CONTINUE  The United States and North Korea resumed talks in Washington on an American demand for access to an underground building site that could be connected with a revived nuclear program in North Korea. The negotiators met in New York on Friday and Saturday, with their agenda restricted to Washington's insistence that North Korea allow inspections of the site at the village of Kumchang-ri.</p>

        <p>JAPAN: ECONOMY IN 'SEVERE STATE'  The head of the Bank of Japan said Japan's economy remains in ''an extremely severe state.'' The central bank governor, Masaru Hayami, told Parliament that corporate earnings had slipped and industrial production had fallen.</p>

        <p>AFRICA</p>
        <p>SOUTH AFRICA: ELECTION PLAN CHALLENGED  The opposition National Party said it would ask the High Court to rule on the constitutionality of requiring citizens to have new ''bar-coded'' identity documents before they can register to vote in national elections next year. The ruling African National Congress is insisting on the documents, but that could result in fewer white voters getting to the polls because many have not applied for the new documents.</p>

        <p>UGANDA: PRESIDENT'S BROTHER QUITS  The brother of Uganda's President resigned as the nation's security adviser after admitting his involvement in a secret deal to buy a 49 percent interest in the Uganda Commercial Bank. Maj. Gen. Salim Saleh, a military adviser to his brother, President Yoweri Museveni, has been criticized for corruption and the military's support of the rebellion in Congo.</p>

        <p>ANGOLA: REBELS TELL OF ATTACKS  The rebel movement Unita said Government forces bombed its strongholds in the towns of Andulo and Bailundo in breach of a four-year peace treaty. Paulo Lukamba Gato, Unita's secretary general, told a Portuguese radio station that the attacks could signal a return to all-out fighting in Angola.</p>

        <p>THE AMERICAS</p>
        <p>ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES: MARIJUANA WAR  Caribbean troops backed by six United States Marine Corps helicopters are beginning a two-week campaign to eradicate an estimated 12,000 acres of marijuana on St. Vincent, BBC News reported. It said the island's marijuana growers' association, warning that the destruction of the crop would drive up the island's 40 percent unemployment rate, has written to President Clinton demanding compensation.</p>
        <p>UNITED STATES: GORE'S GLOBAL CONFERENCE  Vice President Gore is inviting law enforcement and other officials from more than 60 countries to what his office calls the world's first conference on fighting corruption and safeguarding integrity among justice and security officials.
