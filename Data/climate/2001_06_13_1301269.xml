        <p>President Bush today began his first overseas trip since taking office with his most fervent pitch yet for his plan to build a missile defense shield, dismissing a 1972 arms treaty that stands in the way as obsolete and irrelevant to a post-cold-war world.</p>
        <p>''The ABM treaty is a relic of the past,'' Mr. Bush said here this afternoon, referring to the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, signed by Washington and Moscow. ''The days of the cold war have ended, and so must the cold war mentality, as far as I'm concerned.''</p>

        <p>President Bush today began his first overseas trip since taking office with his most fervent pitch yet for his plan to build a missile defense shield, dismissing a 1972 arms treaty that stands in the way as obsolete and irrelevant to a post-cold-war world.</p>
        <p>''The ABM treaty is a relic of the past,'' Mr. Bush said here this afternoon, referring to the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, signed by Washington and Moscow. ''The days of the cold war have ended, and so must the cold war mentality, as far as I'm concerned.''</p>
        <p>The president was equally emphatic about his opposition to a global warming accord supported by European leaders. Just a few hours after environment ministers from the European Union said the president's latest vow to cut greenhouse emissions was unacceptable, Mr. Bush branded the 1997 accord, known as the Kyoto Protocol, ''unrealistic'' and ''not based on sound science.''</p>
        <p>He said that trying to adhere to it would harm an ailing American economy, and he made a fresh argument that Europeans should be concerned about that because of trade with the United States.</p>
        <p>''In order for us to be active traders, our nation's economy must recover,'' Mr. Bush said as he stood next to Prime Minister José María Aznar of Spain at a news conference here. [Excerpts, Page A20.]</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush indeed found in Mr. Aznar someone publicly eager to shower him with praise and reassurance. At the news conference, held in a garden outside Moncloa Palace, Mr. Aznar's residence, the Spanish prime minister expressed interest in the promise of a missile shield and issued what seemed to be a gentle rebuke to other Europeans.</p>
        <p>''What I'm surprised by is the fact that there are people who, from the start, disqualified this initiative,'' Mr. Aznar said, adding that ''what we're dealing with here is an attempt to provide greater security for everyone.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's aim for his first presidential visit to Europe is to assure apprehensive leaders here that his foreign policy will not be unilateral, that he is listening to their concerns and that he considers the alliance between the United States and Europe as vital and important as ever.</p>
        <p>And he carried with him a general message of cooperation, saying time and again that the goals that bound the United States and Europe were stronger than any differences of opinion.</p>
        <p>''There's so much more that unites us than divides us,'' Mr. Bush said, pledging to consult and try to work with European allies on all issues of shared concern. ''We share common values. We trade together. We work on security matters together. And I refuse to let any issue isolate America from Europe.''</p>
        <p>But his appeal for a missile shield and his unwavering rejection of the Kyoto accord put the spotlight on two areas of serious contention between him and European leaders.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Bush toured the royal palace here this morning and later talked for more than three hours with Mr. Aznar, he was taking his biggest step yet onto the world stage, where he is relatively untested and, according to administration officials, largely misunderstood.</p>
        <p>It was intended to be a cautious start to a five-day, five-country diplomatic mission that will continue with a NATO meeting in Belgium on Wednesday and conclude in a meeting with Russian President Vladimir V. Putin in Slovenia on Saturday.</p>
        <p>Spain's government is more conservative than most others in Europe. Its leaders were more likely to be flattered by Mr. Bush's attentions than their counterparts in some other countries. Mr. Bush speaks some Spanish, which he sprinkled repeatedly in his remarks today. And he was not as apt to be greeted here by the kinds of protests expected elsewhere on his tour.</p>
        <p>Only about 400 demonstrators gathered outside the American Embassy in Madrid tonight, toting posters that read ''Bush, imbecile, the world is not your ranch'' and ''Europe rejects a wild Bush-man,'' and they were easily kept in check by hundreds of police officers.</p>
        <p>In a joint statement that Mr. Bush and Mr. Aznar released just before their news conference, the leaders agreed on the need for a ''comprehensive security strategy that encompasses both offensive and defensive deterrent systems.'' It was as unspecific as the proposed architecture for the shield, and it stopped short of an outright endorsement of the plan by the Spanish prime minister.</p>
        <p>Before the news conference, Mr. Bush spent the bulk of his time with Mr. Aznar at the prime minister's country retreat in the Toledo Mountains, a getaway similar in spirit to Mr. Bush's ranch in Crawford, Tex. As the two leaders talked and walked the grounds, neither wore a tie or suit jacket. All in all, the visit seemed perfectly tailored to Mr. Bush's informal tastes, a recipe for a relaxed entry into European politics.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has not always been so sturdy when discussing world affairs and uttering foreign words. On Monday, in an interview with Spanish state television, he mispronounced Mr. Aznar's last name, transposing the middle consonants and saying ''Anzar.''</p>
        <p>There were no such glaring mistakes today, but at the news conference, Mr. Bush was initially soft-voiced and a little stiff, tamping down his usual ebullience to the point where he seemed somewhat tentative. Later, as he expressed his resolve on the missile shield and what he saw as serious flaws in the Kyoto accord, his manner grew more animated and forceful.</p>
        <p>Before leaving the United States, Mr. Bush had sought to allay European fears about the Bush administration's efforts to fight global warming by promising to lead the way on the research and development of technologies that would reduce emissions. But Mr. Bush did not tether himself to anything concrete.</p>
        <p>Several European environment ministers made clear that they were unimpressed.</p>
        <p>''Abandoning the Kyoto Protocol would mean postponing international action to combat climate change for years, and we are already late,'' said Environment Minister Kjell Larsson of Sweden, which currently holds the European Union presidency, in a statement. ''We cannot accept this.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's aides later conceded that while they believed that they were making enormous headway in softening any European resistance to a missile shield, the disagreement over the Kyoto protocol was more severe and less easily resolved.</p>
        <p>One administration official offered a glimpse into the administration's belief that the European proponents of Kyoto were, for political purposes, articulating a lofty vision that was not realistically attainable.</p>
        <p>''I wish I were that pure again,'' the official said sarcastically. ''I wish I could be Swedish.'' Mr. Bush's aides further argue that the accord -- aimed at reducing emissions of greenhouse gases below 1990 levels -- was written to make it easier for Europe than for the United States to meet the goals.</p>
        <p>Another division of opinion between Europe and the United States exists over the death penalty. The execution on Monday of Timothy J. McVeigh virtually guaranteed that Mr. Bush would take a question about his support for capital punishment.</p>
        <p>He told the Spanish journalist who asked him that the death penalty was the democratic consensus of the American people, who he said ''believe that if the death penalty is certain, just and fair, it will deter crime.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush explained that he saw the missile shield as a necessary defense against smaller countries that acquired weapons of mass destruction, not as part of a new arms race, and that people who dismissed its potential utility were ignoring the changing nature of the world.</p>
