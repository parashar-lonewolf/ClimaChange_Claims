        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"Conserve Oil -- and Wilderness" (editorial, Feb. 19) is persuasive only because it ignores two critical facts in the energy debate:</p>
        <p>* Every major oil field in the United States is in decline. Even production at Alaska's Prudhoe Bay, the largest of all, is dropping at a rate of 10 percent a year. Conservation can slow the use of fossil fuels, but not eliminate it. New sources of oil aren't needed so we can burn more; they are needed to maintain our economy while we look for alternatives.</p>
        <p>Some would argue we can just buy what we need on the world market, but that's not necessarily true -- which brings us to the second point:</p>
        <p>* We already import about half our energy supply, which is responsible for about half our enormous trade deficit. And, while energy use in the United States is declining, third-world use is growing rapidly. In 1973, developing countries accounted for only 17 percent of world commercial energy consumption. Today, they account for 23 percent, and their share is expected to rise to 40 percent by 2020. Because oil is non-renewable, with a universally high value, our needs will conflict with those of other nations.</p>
        <p>A rational energy policy will protect our interests in the long term. That means we need stable oil supplies while we find alternatives, and that means new domestic production to help replace our losses. Conservation is crucial, but only part of the answer. FRANK H. MURKOWSKI U.S. Senator from Alaska Washington, March 1, 1991</p>
