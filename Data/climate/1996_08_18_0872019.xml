        <p>THE END OF THE WORLD  The Science and Ethics of Human Extinction.  By John Leslie.  310 pp. New York:  Routledge. $23.</p>
        <p>WHY THINGS BITE BACK  Technology and the Revenge of Unintended Consequences.  By Edward Tenner.  346 pp. New York:  Alfred A. Knopf. $26.</p>
        <p>For Hindus, the end of the world is an inevitable consequence of an ever-cycling universe. A ''day and night of Brahman,'' or a creation-and-destruction cycle, lasts 8.64 billion years. We are now at the tail end of one. To the Hopi Indians, the ''people of peace'' who live on the edge of Arizona's Painted Desert, this is a time of koyaanisqatsi, or ''world out of balance.'' The present world will soon come to a violent end, but Pahana, a messianic figure, will return to usher in a new one. Most Americans find such apocalyptic visions, with their acceptance of destruction, intolerably alien. We do not feel ''at one'' with the universe, as the Hopis, Hindus and others do. We try to control the universe, and everything will be fine if we play our cards right. If we don't, a transcendent but irritable God is waiting to sit in judgment on us.</p>
        <p>Two new books by men neither Hopi nor Hindu offer apocalyptic views. The first, ''The End of the World,'' by John Leslie, is traditionally Judeo-Christian, quietly filled with fire and brimstone, but couched in technological terms. Mr. Leslie, a professor of philosophy at the University of Guelph in Canada, says the end is very near. He cites technological villains: nuclear, biological and chemical warfare, destruction of the ozone layer, the greenhouse effect, pollution and disease, as well as ''risks often unrecognized.'' Among these are volcanic eruptions, asteroid and comet impacts, an ice age due to the earth's passage through an interstellar cloud, a nearby supernova, collisions of black holes or neutron stars, and ''chaotic'' breakdowns such as a dissolution of the planet's biosphere. He also lists man-made disasters -- ''green scum'' (genetically engineered organisms), ''gray goo'' (tiny self-reproducing machines), accidental production of a new Big Bang in a laboratory -- and annihilation by extraterrestrials, among other things.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leslie's major premise is that the end is near because a ''fair proportion'' of all people ever born are now alive. He never commits to a precise figure for this ''fair proportion,'' though for the sake of argument he always uses 10 percent. It is nowhere near 10 percent. Ronald Lee, a demographer and economist at the University of California, Berkeley, says the accumulative population is projected to be 110 billion in the year 2000, with 6 billion of them, or 5.45 percent, still living. Now, the first two humans were 100 percent of the total. Even a few generations later, more than 50 percent must have been alive. So that 5.45 percent looks pretty good. But why does this matter? Mr. Leslie says it is more logical to assume we are in the very last 10 percent of humans rather than, say, in the first 0.01 percent; therefore, statistically, we are doomed.</p>
        <p>It's possible that much of ''The End of the World'' is tongue in cheek. Mr. Leslie's prose, untranslated from the original Canadian, is sometimes as hard to decipher as his math. There are endless exercises in logic. Which is not to say that ''The End of the World'' isn't a fun read. But Mr. Leslie never really tells us where he's coming from, though he cites physicists like Frank Tipler and Paul Davies, who are known not so much for accomplishments in science as for their efforts at reinterpreting modern physics to make it conform to traditional Western religious beliefs. He then drops bigger names, including three Nobel Prize-winning physicists, leaving the impression that such people have joined his apocalyptic bandwagon.</p>
        <p>Have they? Mr. Leslie writes that ''an all-destroying phase transition'' consisting of ''a bubble of 'true vacuum,' '' produced by an ultra-powerful accelerator, could expand through space at nearly the speed of light, destroying everything. He cites the physicist Leon Lederman and David Schramm, an astrophysicist, as predicting that we should have the technology to build such a machine by 2100. Mr. Lederman, with whom I once wrote a book, says, ''That was a joke, an illustration of how one can extrapolate ad absurdum.''</p>
        <p>To be fair, Mr. Leslie is no scientist, and his scenarios are oddly comforting. He places us at an important time in history (the end) and promises us a speedy resolution to our story. We're not Hindus, with eight-billion-year recurring cycles. We like our universe built in seven days, and we expect apocalypse on demand.</p>
        <p>A less expansive but more original book is ''Why Things Bite Back.'' The point made by Edward Tenner, a historian with a Hopi attitude, is not so much that the world is going to hell as that technology simply allows us to get to our own koyaanisqatsi faster. We are threatened not with catastrophe but with subtle reciprocal effects, which he calls''revenge effects.'' For instance, when X-rays were introduced in the 1890's, they became a sensation: ''People with foreign objects lodged in their bodies, even those who suffered no pain from them, now asked to have them extracted -- a procedure that sometimes had fatal complications.'' Today ecologists herald the use of chemical dispersants to break up oil spills. Shorelines are saved, but the petroleum is broken down into minute globules that sink below the surface, where they interfere with the reproduction of much marine life. Bird watchers who have built nesting boxes for Eastern bluebirds find their nests filled with house sparrows instead. Now the North American Bluebird Society recommends wringing the sparrows' necks or putting them in a sack tied to a car's exhaust pipe.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tenner dwells, appropriately, on labor lost to the computer revolution. ''For many users,'' he writes, ''computer software seems related to hardware as Thomas Malthus believed population responded to food resources: software does not just match but eventually outstrips hardware in their respective rates of growth. Users who do not have enough computer power spend more and more time waiting for their systems to finish work.'' The author also points out the hidden cost of ''peer helpers'' -- general employees shanghaied into trouble-shooting computer systems. Mr. Lederman and I once lost an afternoon trying to figure out where his new networked computer at the University of Chicago was printing out a file. We crawled endlessly, following cables, before we found our printout in a distant office. Here was the discoverer of the bottom quark and the muon neutrino being paid to locate a 38-pound laser printer.</p>
        <p>But the author's best shots puncture our attempts to manipulate the earth. Technology allows large populations to inhabit flood plains, but 500,000 lives may have been lost in the 1970 Bangladesh cyclone, mostly because of settlements on reclaimed land that normally would have been left uninhabited. Why doesn't California discourage people from continuing to build in quake-prone Los Angeles? Because Federal earthquake relief in 1994 is credited with accelerating the state's financial recovery by a full fiscal quarter.</p>
        <p>No one is safe from Mr. Tenner's analytical eye. There is even a vicious attack on Smokey Bear, whose simplistic philosophy (a simplistic bear!), he says, promotes suppression of natural fires that clean out the undergrowth. The result is a giant tinderbox of a forest in America.</p>
        <p>I am writing not for policy makers but for people stumbling through a Rube Goldberg world and trying to make sense of it. And I am arguing not against change, but for a modest, tentative and skeptical acceptance of it,'' Mr. Tenner writes. He has amassed a staggering amount of research in ''Why Things Bite Back,'' all of it clearly and succinctly presented. His truest remark is that no futurist ''has ever lost business because of a wrong prediction.'' I predict we will see a lot more doomsday books. Mr. Leslie might disagree, arguing that a ''fair proportion'' of all the doomsday books ever published are in print today and thus the end is near. I doubt it. These books will continue to multiply as we approach 2000. Then, when the rubble from all the New Year's Eve, 1999, parties is cleaned up, some malcontent will point out that the new millennium does not begin in 2000, but in 2001. That will be the real apocalypse: an extra year of doomsday books.</p>
