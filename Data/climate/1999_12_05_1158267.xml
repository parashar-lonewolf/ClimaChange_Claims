        <p>AMERICAN BUILDING: The Environmental Forces That Shape It. By James Marston Fitch with William Bobenhausen. (Oxford, $40.) ''As completely as fish in water, people are submerged in their own environment,'' James Marston Fitch writes. ''But, unlike fish, people act upon their environment as well as being acted upon by it.'' How we do that -- through our natural and artificial responses to light, heat, cold and sound, to say nothing of space, time and gravity -- is the subject of this revised version of a classic work first published by Fitch in 1947 and now thoroughly updated (with the help of the architect William Bobenhausen) to reflect the immense technological changes since then. Their masterly and surprisingly accessible investigation of the functional aspects of architecture addresses issues that few nonprofessionals consider, though the world would be greatly improved if they did.</p>
        <p>The 90-year-old Fitch, doyen of the historic-preservation movement in America, is also an ardent champion of modernism, but he can be frank in his assessments of its physical shortcomings and failures. With a refreshing lack of ideological bias and awe-inspiring erudition, he and his co-author roam across a vast terrain, from the effects of lighting on worker productivity to global warming, from the thermal properties of the igloo to the ergonomics of bathroom fixtures. Their proposed solutions to many architectural and planning problems display so much common sense as to seem obvious, and yet the wisdom they bring to their encyclopedic topic is anything but commonplace. This book ought to be mandatory reading for every architecture student, as well as for any citizen concerned with raising the quality of the built environment.</p>

        <p>POMPEII: Public and Private Life. By Paul Zanker. Translated by Deborah Lucas Schneider. (Harvard, $22.95.) The thousands of Pompeians smothered under the volcanic ash of Vesuvius on Aug. 24 in A.D. 79 survive in the modern imagination. Eerily preserved, their remains and those of their fashionable resort town -- one of the Hamptons of ancient Rome -- provide our clearest picture of urban life 2,000 years ago, illuminated by the mundane details that give Pompeii an immediacy (and profound humanity) exceeding that of other archaeological sites.</p>
        <p>Paul Zanker, the director of the German Archaeological Institute in Rome and a professor of classical archaeology at the University of Munich, has written what is destined to become a classic study. Quietly authoritative, Zanker's brief yet endlessly suggestive overview of Pompeii and its buildings puts architecture, as it ought to be, squarely in the context of the social and spiritual attitudes that produce it.</p>
        <p>As the austere values of the Roman republic were superseded by the exotic Hellenistic tastes of the expanding empire, houses of the well-to-do were transformed into sanctuaries for recreating the golden age of Greece, as well as private stages for Dionysiac pleasures once considered corruptly unpatriotic. Pompeii's inward-turning retreats replicated Greek architecture, wall paintings and sculptures, sometimes with gardens as miniature landscapes that gave the illusion of travel without the inconvenience.</p>
        <p>As Zanker writes of one such Pompeian dream house: ''Perspectives actually intended for wider views are cunningly inverted -- architectural elements borrowed from villas in the country or by the seaside are crammed together into a Walt Disney world. . . . The owner, eager to imitate the lavish world of villas he so clearly admired, preferred quan-</p>
        <p>tity over quality.'' Readers will find several such parallels between life today and the competitively materialistic, luxury-worshiping and nostalgia-fixated inhabitants of not-so-distant Pompeii.</p>
        <p>GERMAN CASTLES AND PALACES. Edited by Klaus Merten. Photography by Paolo Marton. (Vendome, $75.) Less familiar now than their counterparts in Britain, France and Italy, the buildings of German princes and nobles were nonetheless every bit as splendid as could have been wished during the centuries when impressive size and ornamental excess were outward signs of political might. Though there are several famous landmarks in this sumptuous collection -- including the Tiepolo-frescoed Baroque residence of the prince-bishops of Wrzburg, Frederick the Great of Prussia's Rococo bijou of Sanssouci, and Ludwig II of Bavaria's operatic, neomedieval castle of Neuschwanstein -- many of the 53 works chosen by Klaus Merten, the chief curator of palaces and gardens for the state of Baden-Wrttemberg, come as a revelation.</p>
        <p>Among the most delightful is Favorite, the summer palace of the dukes of Wrttemberg, in Ludwigsburg. Its vigorous, warmly colored stucco exterior, built around 1720, contrasts with the cool elegance of the neo-Classical interiors, redone at the turn of the 19th century. By the 1820's, when the greatest German architect, Karl Friedrich Schinkel, remodeled and decorated the romantic hideaway of Charlottenhof on the grounds of Sanssouci for the Prussian crown prince and princess, the remarkable transition from authoritarian display to familial gemtlichkeit was complete.</p>
        <p>JOHN SOANE: An Accidental Romantic. By Gillian Darley. (Yale University, $45.) JOHN SOANE: Architect. Edited by Margaret Richardson and Mary Anne Stevens. (Royal Academy of Art/Yale University, $75.) Sir John Soane died the year Queen Victoria ascended the British throne, but more than historical happenstance made him a pivotal figure between ancient tradition and nascent modernism. Soane, the brilliant, ambitious son of a bricklayer, immersed himself in the classical tradition, but was so sure of his talents that he played with the grand manner in ways none of his contemporaries dared. He slashed fearlessly through walls, floors and ceilings to create dynamic interiors that soar, plunge and even seem to hover in midair, none more so than those of his own London residence, which he worked on from 1792 to 1834. That intricate, obsessive remodeling of a plain Georgian row house into a private museum is a touchstone to architects mesmerized by Soane's powerful manipulations of space and scale; they are intensified by the plethora of art objects and architectural fragments with which the compulsive collector fended off his horror vacui.</p>
        <p>This compellingly readable biography by the British architectural historian Gillian Darley brings Soane, the working-class knight, to life as a mass of contradictions: a paranoid with real enemies, a once-devoted father who became estranged from his sons and a roaring eccentric who rose to the pinnacle of his strait-laced profession. Probing deeply into the architect's now largely destroyed body of work, Darley revisits many long-forgotten structures, including the imaginative outbuildings of country houses that survived through benign bucolic neglect. In an intriguing postscript, the author notes her subject's enduring influence in Sir Giles Gilbert Scott's iconic red telephone booths of 1924, the shallow pendentive dome of which was clearly inspired by Soane's family tomb.</p>
        <p>''John Soane: Architect,'' the ravishingly illustrated catalog of the superb exhibition held at the Royal Academy of Art in London this fall, vividly conveys the elusive luminosity and spatial daring of his buildings. In their rule-breaking audacity they remain accurate reflections of his singular vision and angular personality.</p>
        <p>E. W. GODWIN: Aesthetic Movement Architect and Designer. Edited by Susan Weber Soros. (Bard Graduate Center/Yale University, $75.) Now known only to decorative arts specialists, the 19th-century British architect and critic Edward William Godwin is best remembered for his modern-looking, clean-lined ebonized furniture. But Godwin was renowned in his own time as a leader of the aesthetic movement, involving a group of well-heeled rebels who wanted to free the arts from Victorian moralizing and to foster a sensuous ''art for art's sake.'' Enraptured by the rich visual culture of Japan, which only recently had been revealed to the West, he showed his fellow aesthetes James McNeill Whistler and Oscar Wilde (for whom he built and decorated houses in London) how to live the exquisitely rarefied life they philosophized about.</p>
        <p>Inspired by styles from the Egyptian to the Chinese to the Gothic, Godwin designed everything from ceramics and wallpaper to costumes and theatrical scenery. He typified his period's fascination with the gesamtkunstwerk in his fully coordinated environments wherein no detail was left to chance.</p>
        <p>Far from being a paragon of preciousness, Godwin was outrageous and contentious, carrying on an affair with the celebrated actress Ellen Terry (by whom he fathered two children, including the theatrical designer Edward Gordon Craig) and sparring with collaborators. Reform-minded but self-indulgent, he never shared the philosophical interests and political activism of his protean design rival, William Morris, and soon after Godwin died at 53 in 1886 his work slipped into oblivion.</p>
        <p>This superlative catalog, now the essential publication on the subject, was edited by Susan Weber Soros, founder and director of New York's Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, where the Godwin exhibition she curated is on view through Feb. 27. In an excellent series of essays by Soros and nine other experts, a cumulative portrait of the multifaceted architect emerges that is strongly outlined and finely detailed.</p>
        <p>SHINGLE STYLES: Innovation and Tradition in American Architecture, 1874 to 1982. Photography by Bret Morgan. Text by Leland M. Roth. (Norfleet/</p>
        <p>Abrams, $49.50.) One of the bright spots on the American scene after the Civil War was the rise of the shingle style, an architectural mode that drew on the aesthetic movement as well as American colonial traditions. In contrast to the vulgar showplaces of the era's new rich, the shingle style -- named for its favored cladding material by the architectural historian Vincent Scully -- demonstrated how grand houses could be free of ostentation but full of dignity, establishing a standard for plutocratic restraint that persists in old-money circles to this day.</p>
        <p>The multigabled, porch-wrapped mansions that were popular in resorts like Tuxedo Park, N.Y., Newport, R.I., and the East End of Long Island soon became the model for smaller domestic schemes throughout the country, a logical adaptation because the shingle style took many of its cues from modest sources. This handsome survey, selected by Leland M. Roth, an architectural historian at the University of Oregon, and illustrated with the moody color photographs of Bret Morgan, is a worthy celebration of a distinctively American way of building.</p>
        <p>Though it was a mistake for Roth to include lesser shingle style revival work of recent decades (like an awkward postmodern pastiche by Robert A. M. Stern), in the book one can look back with unadulterated pleasure on many glorious examples of the real thing.</p>
        <p>GAUDO: The Man and His Work. Text by Joan Bergos. Photographs by Marc Llimargas. (Bulfinch, $75.) BARCELONA ART NOUVEAU. Text by Lluis Permanyer. Photography by Melba Levick. (Rizzoli, $55.) Fueled by a booming textile-manufacturing economy, turn-of-the-century Barcelona was further fortunate in having adventurous architecture patrons who prompted a torrent of creativity. Modernisme, the Catalan variant of Art Nouveau, was a farrago of Moorish, Gothic and Classical details so strongly seasoned with Arts and Crafts elements that an entirely new style emerged, which its proudly nationalistic supporters saw as a fitting expression of Catalonia's cultural independence.</p>
        <p>Though the sensuously molded and bizarrely detailed structures of Antonio Gaudi are well known, the Catalan photographer Marc Llimargas's eye for revelatory detail is extraordinary. The vibrant color images he took for ''Gaudi: The Man and His Work'' (translated from a 1947 book by Joan Bergos, a younger collaborator of the master) make it seem as though one is seeing those buildings for the first time.</p>
        <p>In ''Barcelona Art Nouveau,'' Lluis Permanyer, a native of the city, and the American photographer Melba Levick do equal justice to the work of Gaudi's less-acclaimed but gifted contemporaries, especially Lluis Domenech, Josep Puig and Josep Vilaseca. Domenech's Palau de la Musica Catalana of 1905-08 is the city's architectural masterpiece. No other concert hall approaches its over-the-top opulence and decorative superabundance. The ceiling of the auditorium is aglitter with fan vaults of mosaic peacock feathers, studded with ceramic roses in full bloom and culminating in a spectacular stained-glass dome that recalls an immense, inverted Tiffany lampshade. As Permanyer writes, ''It is the most modernist building in the world.''</p>
        <p>IRVING GILL AND THE ARCHITECTURE OF REFORM: A Study in Modernist Architectural Culture. By Thomas S. Hines. (Monacelli, $75.) Trained in Chicago by Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright, Irving Gill found early 20th-century Southern California to be fertile ground for his rigorously unornamented architecture and progressive movement politics. Gill was captivated by the pared-down forms of Indian adobes and Spanish colonial missions, as well as the white-walled, cubic North African Arabic buildings that also inspired his like-minded European contemporaries Adolf Loos and Le Corbusier. Gill sought to sweep away retrograde historicism and supplant it with a pure, energizing architecture he believed would promote everything from better hygiene to more equitable social standards.</p>
        <p>Gill, who was a Quaker, declared, ''We must dare to be simple, and get back to the source of all architectural strength -- the straight line, the arch, the cube and the circle.'' That he did in a pathbreaking series of public buildings, private houses and multi-unit dwellings, culminating in his arcaded La Jolla Woman's Club of 1912-14 and the minimalist Dodge house of 1914-16 in West Hollywood. Favoring inventive new methods like slab-tilt construction -- in which concrete was poured into rectangular molds on the ground and then hoisted 90 degrees to make walls -- Gill was as innovative in practice as he was in spirit. Most touching are the dozen low-cost but highly dignified adobe-style concrete cottages he completed in 1933, three years before his death, for the Rancho Barona Indian Reservation in Lakeside, Calif., bringing full circle his homage to the architecture of the inhabitants' ancestors.</p>
        <p>Alas, two-thirds of Gill's 300 buildings have been torn down, the majority of the remainder altered beyond recognition, and his archives were put out with the trash, making this first-ever monograph a heroic effort. Scrupulously researched and engagingly written by Thomas S. Hines, a professor of history and architecture at the University of California, Los Angeles, this long-hoped-for volume fills a shocking lapse in architectural literature.</p>
        <p>CARLO SCARPA ARCHITECT: Intervening With History. By Nicholas Olsberg, George Ranalli, Jean-Francois Bedard, Sergio Polano, Alba di Lieto and Mildred Friedman. Photographs by Guido Guidi. (Canadian Center for Architecture/Monacelli, paper, $45.) Although the Venetian architect Carlo Scarpa (1906-78) is unknown to the general public, he has long been a cult figure among professionals. They revere Scarpa's fanatic attention to detail in his small but emotionally engaging structures, which display a rare ability to focus on the intimate and the cosmic with equal intensity. Though he built very little, and most of that consisted of remodelings of existing structures, his principled stance against rampant commercialism and internationalization have special pertinence today.</p>
        <p>Scarpa fits neatly into no niche of the modern movement save his own. Immersed in the architecture of his birthplace and the surrounding Veneto region, he knew better than to ape it. ''I have always had . . . an immense desire to belong to tradition,'' he said, ''but without having capitals or columns.'' Instead, he honored the past through contemporary forms made from local materials and constructed with age-old techniques. His regionally rooted but universally resonant designs -- above all three Italian museums and several memorable tombs -- feel so authentic because he cared not a whit about style and everything about the enduring verities of architecture.</p>
        <p>This publication of the exemplary Scarpa exhibition held at the Canadian Center for Architecture in Montreal earlier this year makes the architect's often cryptic schemes more intelligible to a general audience than ever before. The thoughtful essays, particularly those by the show's guest curator, Mildred Friedman, and its designer, the American architect George Ranalli, explain Scarpa's continuing hold on the architectural mind. Guido Guidi's subtle color photographs are among the most affecting architectural images in recent memory, capturing the spirit of place that was all-important to the master, as well as evoking his poignant sense of the passage of time.</p>
        <p>VENTURI, SCOTT BROWN &amp; ASSOCIATES: Buildings and Projects, 1986-1998. By Stanislaus von Moos. (Monacelli, cloth, $65; paper, $45.) Like their contemporary, Andy Warhol, the self-described Pop architects Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown have always been more appreciated in Europe than in America. It is easy to understand why. The deceptively superficial appearance of some work by this Philadelphia-based husband-and-wife team, as well as their nonjudgmental embrace of commercial imagery, has led certain critics to dismiss them as capitulating to the venal impulses of a celebrity-mad, consumer-driven society. Their genius for taking the givens of popular culture and transforming them into high art is more apparent to those at a safe remove from a setting where such wry (but also affectionate) appropriations hit a bit too close to home.</p>
        <p>Among Venturi's and Scott Brown's most perceptive commentators is the Swiss architectural historian Stanislaus von Moos, a professor at the University of Zurich. This second volume in von Moos's survey of their complete works reconfirms him as a level-headed and insightful appraiser of their wildly varied output. Their schemes can be by turns appropriately majestic (like their Sainsbury Wing of 1986-91 at the National Gallery in London, which displays Renaissance paintings with immense nobility) or provocatively gaudy (the Hotel Mielparque Resort Complex of 1992-97 in Nikko, Japan, part ukiyo-e (floating-world) print, part comic book, part ''Madama Butterfly'' stage set). But these architects are auteurs of their medium, and every project of theirs is worthy of serious consideration.</p>
        <p>For all their stylistic swings, Venturi and Scott Brown have developed a brisk business in campus architecture. At Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania, among other schools, they have taken the Victorian collegiate style and abstracted it into an adaptable vocabulary of lively patterned brick jolted with the odd, unexpected detail, all the while responding to traditional settings much more effectively, and subversively, than the big names of modernism ever did.</p>
        <p>GEHRY TALKS: Architecture + Process. Edited by Mildred Friedman. (Rizzoli, $65.) Because he almost never writes, Frank Gehry has been taken to task by his theory-oriented colleagues, who think that hypothesizing about architecture is more important than making it. Since the completion of Gehry's universally praised Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in Spain two years ago, the audience of those who want to know why he designs and how he builds such idiosyncratic structures has grown exponentially.</p>
        <p>To answer the clamor for a first-person account of his work, Gehry agreed to discuss his architecture with his old friend Mildred Friedman, the former design curator of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, who organized that museum's landmark 1986 retrospective of his work. Friedman has taped and edited a long series of conversations with the architect about his output since her show. This is the best explication yet of his creative method; it is exceptional for its comprehensiveness, clarity and extreme candor.</p>
        <p>Friedman covers the decisive shift in Gehry's career from small-scale projects designed by conventional means to larger schemes of amazing complexity made possible by his firm's use of Catia, a computer program devised for plotting the irregular forms used in the aerospace industry. That software was the breakthrough that enabled him to retain the spontaneity of his initial sketches in the final design at Bilbao. ''This is the first time I've gotten it,'' he says of that newfound freedom. ''And once you taste blood, you're not going to give up.''</p>
