        <p>Allied-Signal Inc. is the second largest domestic producer of chlorofluorocarbons. Marylyn I. Montgomery, vice president and general manager of Allied-Signal's Genetron business, and Bernard Sukornick, director of fluorochemicals research, talked with the Business Forum editor, Joel Kurtzman, about why Allied-Signal plans to continue production of chlorofluorocarbons as it seeks suitable substitutes.</p>
        <p>Question: How important are chlorofluorocarbons to industry?</p>
        <p>Ms. Montgomery: C.F.C.'s are enormously important to industry and society. They are used as the predominant refrigerants for air conditioners, and in the manufacturing of printed circuit boards. They are used in combination with other products to sterilize medical instruments and to produce blown foams.</p>
        <p>Q. Recent data from NASA indicates that the ozone layer is being depeted far more rapidly than was previously thought. Do you agree with these conclusions?</p>
        <p>Ms. Montgomery: We are still trying to get a hold of the data. We haven't had a chance to examine it.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sukornick: From what we understand, NASA's study shows a very different trend from what we had assumed in the past. It shows a very dramatic, dangerous depletion of the ozone. As a result, we are working on a very accelerated schedule to come up with substitutes.</p>
        <p>Q. When did you first begin to seek substitutes for C.F.C.'s?</p>
        <p>Dr. Sukornick: We began our conceptual work in 1974 when we found out that certain C.F.C.'s could damage the ozone layer. We asked ourselves what molecules were available as substitutes, and which of these could be commercialized. Our laboratory experiments began in 1978.</p>
        <p>Q. How large are your research expenditures?</p>
        <p>Dr. Sukornick: We don't give out those figures. But research is the smallest part. After you have figured out which chemicals you want to make, you have to figure out how to make them. You have to build pilot plants and run the process with large enough quantitites around the clock. And then you must invest millions to build a commerical size facility in order to really understand what is going on and how to get rid of the by products of the chemical processes. You also need to do tests in order to determine that the new product is safe. After that comes the investment in commericializing product.</p>
        <p>Under the present circumstances, every step is compressed, which adds to the risks.</p>
        <p>Ms. Montgomery: Fourteen major chemical companies around the world are working jointly on toxicological studies of possible substitutes. We have a development alliance with the French company, Elf Aquitaine.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sukornick: There are only three or four substitutes for the important C.F.C's. The race is on to see who can commercialize the ones that will have the highest probability of being a ''drop in'' replacement for the existing chemicals.</p>
        <p>Q. Given the development costs, will the substitutes be profitable?</p>
        <p>Ms. Montgomery: There is a real business opportunity here because the market is so large and the needs for substitutes so real. But the costs for the substitutes will have to be higher than for the current products.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sukornick: You have to put the situation in context. C.F.C.'s were developed back in the 1930's. The cost effectiveness for producing these products has been driven to the point where you can't squeeze out another penny. When you introduce a substitute, the first five years or so are spent learning how to produce it more efficiently and cost effectively.</p>
        <p>Q. How large a share of Allied-Signal's income is derived from these products?</p>
        <p>Ms. Montgomery: We don't divulge those figures. But the entire engineered materials sector of the company produces only about 25 percent of our revenue.</p>
        <p>Q. How long will you continue to produce C.F.C.'s?</p>
        <p>Ms. Montgomery: We endorse the Montreal Protocol for phasing out 50 percent of C.F.C. production by 1998. We will continue to support the protocol. Whether we decide to phase out our production sooner, or phase out more than 50 percent, will depend upon our examination of the NASA data. We have not set a date for withdrawl from the market.</p>
        <p>The depletion of the ozone in the stratosphere is a global problem. We are concerned by any unilateral action that the United States might take, such as banning domestic production. If other nations don't restrict their production, it won't help much if we stop ours.</p>
