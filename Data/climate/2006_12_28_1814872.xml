        <p>It would not be easy to find two men more different than Gerald Ford and James Brown. But I had a similar reaction to each of their deaths -- a feeling of disappointment at some of the routes the nation has traveled since their days of greatest prominence.</p>
        <p>Both men were important figures, symbolically more than substantively, at crucial periods in postwar American history -- Mr. Brown at the crest of the civil rights movement in the mid-1960s and Mr. Ford in the trough of the ''long national nightmare'' of Watergate.</p>
        <p>Both were unlikely harbingers of the new. Mr. Brown, with his gleaming (and anachronistic) pompadour, became the very embodiment of black pride, a troubadour exhorting his followers to ''Say it Loud -- I'm Black and I'm Proud'' at a time when schoolhouse doors were opening and unprecedented opportunities were beckoning to black Americans after centuries of almost unimaginable degradation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford was more than just the designated healer after Watergate. The U.S. was also in the final throes of the long national nightmare of Vietnam. And it was stuck in a protracted energy crisis. The nation was looking for a way forward.</p>
        <p>My disappointment stems from the opportunities never seized and the lessons never learned from those two periods, which were all but bursting with possibilities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown's message was relentlessly upbeat and optimistic. Despite the continuing plague of racism, there were dreams in the 1960s of fabulous days ahead for black Americans, days in which the stereotypes and degradation of the past would be erased by a new era of educational, professional and cultural achievement.</p>
        <p>Those dreams did not include visions of an enormous economically disadvantaged population that would continue to live in poverty, or near-poverty, more than 40 years later; or a perennially ragged public school system, largely segregated in fact, if not by law, that would turn out generation after generation of educationally deprived children; or a black prison population so vast and so enduring it would come to seem normal to legions of black youngsters, actually dictating to a great extent their tastes in fashion, art and music; or a level of sustained violence that has condemned thousands upon thousands of black youngsters to an early grave.</p>
        <p>Oh, there have been plenty of strides since the mid-1960s. That's undeniable. But one would have to be blind not to notice that there is much cause for disappointment, as well.</p>
        <p>James Farmer, who helped create the Congress of Racial Equality on Gandhian principles of nonviolence, once told me that even as the civil rights movement was racking up its stunning successes, its leaders made a grave error.</p>
        <p>''We did not do any long-range planning,'' he said. ''So we were stuck without a program after the success of our efforts, which included passage of a civil rights bill and voting rights legislation. We could have anticipated the backlash that followed. We could have asked ourselves what the jobs prospects would be for blacks in the '70s, the '80s, the '90s, and later on. By and large we didn't do that, except for affirmative action. We should have had a plan.''</p>
        <p>It would be foolish to suggest that the United States as a whole hasn't made tremendous progress since the 1960s and '70s. But it's impossible to reflect on the presidency of Gerald Ford, who formally ended U.S. participation in the war in Vietnam, and fail to notice that his defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, and chief of staff, Dick Cheney, were among the chief architects of the current calamity in Iraq. There were lessons galore to be learned from Vietnam. But Mr. Rumsfeld and Mr. Cheney, like frat boys skipping an important lecture, managed to ignore them.</p>
        <p>The trauma of the 1973 oil embargo actually spooked the country into action on the energy front. Fuel economy standards for automobiles were ratcheted up and improvements were made in the energy efficiency of refrigerators, air-conditioners and other household appliances. But those successful early efforts, instead of being strengthened, were undermined by the conservative political tide of the past several years.</p>
        <p>Now we're confronted with the dire threat of global warming, and as usual there is no plan.</p>
        <p>If history tells us anything, it's that we never learn from history. We could have stepped back from the war in Iraq, and stepped up to the challenge of global warming. We could have learned something when James Brown was on the charts and Gerald Ford was in the White House.</p>
        <p>Maybe next time.</p>
