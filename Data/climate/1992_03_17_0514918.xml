        <p>"The End of the Modern Era," (Op-Ed, March 1), Vaclav Havel's New Age maundering, would not be so ominous if he were not in charge of a newly democratized nation, and thus the focus of a certain hopeful expectancy. To Mr. Havel the end of Communism is a "message to the human race" that employing the scientific method and accumulated objective knowledge to help bring about commonly agreed-upon social goals is not the way to go.</p>
        <p>Instead, he offers a wan spirituality in which we are led by a new breed of politicians, each with "trust in his own subjectivity as his principal link with the subjectivity of the world."</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"The End of the Modern Era," (Op-Ed, March 1), Vaclav Havel's New Age maundering, would not be so ominous if he were not in charge of a newly democratized nation, and thus the focus of a certain hopeful expectancy. To Mr. Havel the end of Communism is a "message to the human race" that employing the scientific method and accumulated objective knowledge to help bring about commonly agreed-upon social goals is not the way to go.</p>
        <p>Instead, he offers a wan spirituality in which we are led by a new breed of politicians, each with "trust in his own subjectivity as his principal link with the subjectivity of the world."</p>
        <p>If this is how Mr. Havel views himself we are all in trouble. His call to irrationalism will be of little help against the population explosion, the greenhouse effect, holes in the ozone layer, the dramatically widening gap between the rich north and the poor south, the danger of famine, the depletion of the biosphere and the mineral resources of the planet, and the expansion of commercial television culture, all of which he points to as signs that civilization is in danger.</p>
        <p>Mr. Havel's embrace of the free-market system, which many consider a major contributor to these disasters, can only be justified by a commitment to a scientific attitude in which policies are continually reassessed in relation to experience.</p>
        <p>Few would begrudge the Czechoslovak people and other Eastern Europeans their newly won freedom to experiment with new social and economic directions. But in their attempts to avoid previous errors of both the communist and capitalist systems, they will not be helped, in our opinion, by the sort of dangerous obscurantism represented by Mr. Havel's words.
