        <p>One important item that hit the cutting room floor recently when New York lawmakers produced a new state budget was the Bigger, Better Bottle Bill. This bill -- known as the BBBB in Albany -- would make one of the state's best environmental laws even better. A bill like the BBBB that cuts down on litter, encourages recycling, saves natural resources and provides funds to help the environment should be an easy step for New York's legislators and Gov. Eliot Spitzer.</p>
        <p>Overall, New York's environment did reasonably well in Mr. Spitzer's first budget. The previous administration had severely cut back on the number of experts who are supposed to protect and monitor the state's air, land and water. The new budget adds more than 100 scientists, engineers and enforcement officials to the Department of Environmental Conservation, including a badly-needed new office of climate change. And the Senate approved Assemblyman Alexander Grannis of New York City to be the new environmental commissioner despite a misguided campaign by the gun lobby.</p>

        <p>One important item that hit the cutting room floor recently when New York lawmakers produced a new state budget was the Bigger, Better Bottle Bill. This bill -- known as the BBBB in Albany -- would make one of the state's best environmental laws even better. A bill like the BBBB that cuts down on litter, encourages recycling, saves natural resources and provides funds to help the environment should be an easy step for New York's legislators and Gov. Eliot Spitzer.</p>
        <p>Overall, New York's environment did reasonably well in Mr. Spitzer's first budget. The previous administration had severely cut back on the number of experts who are supposed to protect and monitor the state's air, land and water. The new budget adds more than 100 scientists, engineers and enforcement officials to the Department of Environmental Conservation, including a badly-needed new office of climate change. And the Senate approved Assemblyman Alexander Grannis of New York City to be the new environmental commissioner despite a misguided campaign by the gun lobby.</p>
        <p>The only blemish was the failure to enact the the bottle redemption bill. The bill is a perfect fit for those in both parties who label themselves environmentalists. But lobbyists from the beverage industry have been working against it for years because industry earns millions of dollars when consumers fail to redeem their bottles and cans.</p>
        <p>Until recently, anti-bottle-bill forces helped convince a number of key legislators -- including the State Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno -- that this bill was really a new tax on those who consumed bottled beverages. That view seemed to change with the election of Mr. Spitzer, who promised to support the better bottle bill. After Mr. Spitzer and legislative leaders dropped the bill from this year's budget negotiations, the governor made it clear that he still hoped the bill would be passed this session. Even some of Mr. Bruno's colleagues who have resisted this idea have been talking about producing an expanded bottle bill.</p>
        <p>Over all, the bill is a good one that does not need another legislative overhaul, especially from opponents trying to find artful ways to kill it. The bill adds to the list of bottles that can be returned for a nickel to include water, iced tea, sports drinks and juice. (Have you ever noticed that most of the containers along the roadside or in the rivers once contained water, iced tea, sports drinks or juice?) Right now only carbonated soft drinks, sparkling water, beer or wine coolers can be redeemed. But even that limited coverage has resulted in the return or recycling of more than 90 billion cans and bottles since the law took effect 25 years ago.</p>
        <p>The fact that the new bill would regulate more containers than the present law worries owners of smaller grocery stores, who don't want their stores to become mini-recycling centers. But the bill would also increase the stores' handling fee to 3.5 cents a bottle from 2 cents and allows smaller stores in New York City to impose limits on their customers.</p>
        <p>The measure would add at least 3.5 billion cans and bottles to the recycling bins each year. And the money forfeited when people fail to redeem their bottles and collect their nickels would provide over $100 million a year to clean up the environment. Right now those unclaimed funds stay with the distributors and beverage industry, which helps explains their resistance to this bill.</p>
        <p>It is time for New York's lawmakers to update the good old bottle bill to make it better, enlarging its scope and giving those unclaimed nickels back to the public, where they belong.</p>
