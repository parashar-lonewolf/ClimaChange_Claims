        <p>LEAD: The photographs told a dramatic tale: panoramic shots of mountains dotted with dead and dying trees, close-ups of yellowing needles and lifeless branches.</p>
        <p>The photographs told a dramatic tale: panoramic shots of mountains dotted with dead and dying trees, close-ups of yellowing needles and lifeless branches.</p>
        <p>The pictures, some taken in West Germany, others in the Appalachian Mountains of the eastern United States, were displayed at a five-day conference that brought together West German and American scientists. Among the participants at the gathering, which began Monday, were scientists who study the health of forests from satellite photographs taken 500 miles above the earth, those who study roots and seeds, and those who study everything in between.</p>
        <p>The scientists agreed, as they have for years, that the trees in both countries were dying for unexplained and complex reasons, apparently a combination of man-made and natural causes. But that was about the extent of the agreement.</p>
        <p>The Germans have been studying forest problems since 1979, when silver fir trees inexplicably began dying in the southern part of their country. The decline has since been documented in other species throughout West Germany. Americans joined the study several years later, when it became clear that spruce and fir trees at high elevations in the eastern United States were suffering unexplained damage. Such damage has also been noted in the San Bernardino mountains in California. Exchange of Data</p>
        <p>Since then, experts from both countries have exchanged information regularly in scientific journals and at conferences such as the one here on ''The Effects of Atmospheric Pollution on Spruce and Fir Trees in the Eastern United States and the Federal Republic of Germany.''</p>
        <p>At the meeting here Peter Schutt, a forest botanist at the University of Munich, spoke eloquently and rather gloomily of ''Waldersterben,'' or ''forest death,'' and of the myriad man-made air pollutants that might be contributing factors. Dr. Schutt and others believe that the destruction is being caused by the combined effects of pollutants, rather than by specific types of pollutants acting alone.</p>
        <p>''This pollution is caused not just by big companies but by individuals, by you and me,'' said Dr. Schutt as he stood on a fog-shrouded slope of Whiteface Mountain, a research site in New York's Adirondacks that the scientists visited. He said preserving the health of forests meant that individuals must reduce their use of substances, like gasoline, that pollute the environment. ''And what politician wants to tell people that?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>Bernhard Prinz, a scientist with the Institute for Air Pollution Control of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, disagreed with Dr. Schutt. Dr. Prinz objected to Dr. Schutt's use of the word ''Waldersterben'' as ''overly dramatic,'' saying that he preferred to describe what was happening as a ''forest decline.'' He called on scientists to work to pinpoint the causes of the forest malaise, and ''not to throw up our hands and say it's too complicated.'' Theories on Causes</p>
        <p>Dr. Prinz believes that a prime cause of the declines is low-altitude ozone that is created from the burning of fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>Alan Wellburn, a scientist from Lancaster, England, who works on an American-financed project there, said his research had shown that trees under stress from both natural and man-made causes manufactured in their leaves or needles a substance called ethyline, which then reacted with ozone and caused the trees to die.</p>
        <p>Dr. Art Johnson of the University of Pennsylvania stressed the need to look at natural causes of forest decline: winter stress, age, disease, insects and wind.</p>
        <p>Others placed more blame on acid rain, largely sulfur dioxides and nitrogen oxides that are carried through the atmosphere, where they are transformed chemically and fall to earth as precipitation. They believe acid rain results in the leaching of nutrients from leaves, and that it can alter soil chemistry to the detriment of tree growth. Similarity of Problems</p>
        <p>Gerard D. Hertel, program manager of the Spruce-Fir Research Cooperative, a Federal research center based in Broomall, Pa., said the diversity of opinion was important. ''We share essentially the same kinds of problems in both countries,'' said Dr. Hertel. ''Instead of having one set of data, we have two to compare.'' Over time, he said, a consensus will emerge.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hertel's office was one of several sponsors of the conference, which included the the University of Vermont School of Natural Resources and Department of Botany, and three major coal producers.</p>
        <p>Richard Kerch, a spokesman for Consolidated Coal Company of Pittsburgh, said the discussions showed that ''it is not clear by any stretch that acid rain is causing forest decline'' and that if coal producers are required to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions, a main component of acid rain, it ''clearly will not be a cure-all.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Hertel's office works under the auspices of the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program, which earlier this fall released a preliminary report concluding that acid rain posed no immediate broad threat to the environment or public health.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hertel said the report, which was strongly criticized by many environmentalists and scientists, accurately reflected the findings on spruce and fir trees. Several American scientists at the conference said the report was incomplete, but they declined comment. The Germans interviewed said they had just learned of the report and had not yet read it. All agreed that forest decline could not be totally explained by acid precipitation.</p>
        <p>Dr. Schutt said the diversity of opinions and findings was to be expected because the subject of forest decline was so complex. Examination of the problem requires the study of soils, botany, insects and diseases, biochemistry, climate and air. ''When you try to understand the way a complex group of pollutants affects an extremely complex ecosystem, the problems are multiplied many times over,'' he said.</p>
