        <p>Senate Democrats agreed with President Bush and Senate Republicans on Wednesday on the need to reduce the nation's dependence on imported oil. What they differed on was how to do it.</p>
        <p>As the Senate debated its energy measure, Republican leaders offered strong opposition when Democrats proposed to set a broad goal of reducing oil imports by 40 percent in 20 years. The Republicans called it a pie-in-the-sky plan that would upend the nation's transportation system.</p>
        <p>''I envisioned everybody this summer or next year traveling with their little Segways -- two or three piled on each one -- going out to the Nationals' games,'' said the Senate majority leader, Bill Frist of Tennessee.</p>
        <p>In a speech devoted to energy policy, Mr. Bush also called for the nation to wean itself from foreign supplies. But he said Americans should cut their reliance by embracing energy efficiency as well as oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</p>
        <p>He said a new emphasis on biofuels like corn-based ethanol would contribute to a reduction in imports. That idea was backed in the Senate on Wednesday, as lawmakers voted 70 to 26 to require refiners to add eight billion gallons of ethanol each year to the gasoline supply by 2012. It was one of the first significant votes on a measure expected to occupy the Senate for at least the next two weeks.</p>
        <p>''I like the idea of spending money on research to make ethanol more feasible, so that some day an American president says, 'Show me the crop report' as opposed to, 'How many barrels of crude oil are we importing?''' Mr. Bush said in the speech, at a forum on energy efficiency.</p>
        <p>The White House, however, opposes a Republican-backed provision in the energy bill that would encourage the president to reduce oil consumption by one million barrels a day within 10 years, illustrating how diverse views on handling the nation's energy problems are complicating agreement on an overall bill.</p>
        <p>Democrats pointed to the administration's opposition to the million-barrel reduction as evidence that Mr. Bush is not serious about lowering oil imports.</p>
        <p>''The Bush administration is running on empty when it comes to our nation's energy policy,'' said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Democrat. ''As long as America's energy needs are tied to the interests and profits of oil cartels, we have no control over our future.''</p>
        <p>Democrats say their proposal encouraging a 40 percent reduction in imports by 2025 -- a figure they say represents more than 7.5 million barrels of oil a day -- would send a strong signal about the nation's intent without instituting requirements about how to reach that goal. Republican leaders said the goal could not be attained without steep increases in automotive fuel efficiency.</p>
        <p>''It's clearly nothing that anybody could achieve,'' said Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico and the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.</p>
        <p>While the Senate moved toward votes on the 40 percent plan and a second proposal to require utilities to use more renewable fuels, two lawmakers issued a study by the Government Accountability Office that characterized the nation's energy policy as a vast assortment of uncoordinated programs with few clear ways to measure their effectiveness.</p>
        <p>''The G.A.O. report shows that America's energy plan is incremental, at best, and lacks clear benchmarks with measurable targets,'' said Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, who added that the nation was ''treading water.''</p>
        <p>In another development related to the energy measure, Mr. Domenici said he was considering backing one of the emerging proposals intended to reduce emissions blamed for global warming. His support would be a major boost for such a plan, enhancing the chances of a climate change initiative being approved after years of rejection.</p>
        <p>''I have certainly not made up my mind yet,'' said Mr. Domenici, who said he was also discussing the issue with the White House, which opposes such mandatory reductions.</p>
        <p>The decision by senators to support the use of ethanol -- a House-passed bill requires five billion gallons -- came after lawmakers defeated an effort by Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, to reject a biofuels requirement that he said would drive up the cost of gasoline to benefit corn growers. ''Like too much of this bill, this provision helps the special interest, not the public interest,'' Mr. Schumer said.</p>
        <p>The Senate would like to finish the measure by the end of next week, although Mr. Domenici said that timetable might slip a bit. Mr. Bush urged Congress to move quickly.</p>
        <p>''Summer's here, temperatures are rising, and tempers will really rise if Congress doesn't pass an energy bill,'' the president said.</p>
