        <p>In a sense, the fate of the planet is a continuing drama. What will happen to the ozone layer, to the rain forests, to air and water quality? Tune in during the next century for some clues.</p>
        <p>So it does not seem too incongruous that the folks who specialize in cliff-hangers of a different sort -- soap operas -- should have some interest in the environment.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, 13 members of the cast of "One Life to Live" will enact little dramas about environmental problems and their solutions at a luncheon to benefit the Student Environmental Action Coalition, a three-year-old organization of high school and college students. The luncheon is to be held in the Macklowe Hotel Theater.</p>
        <p>In one skit, ROBERT S. WOODS, who plays the romantic Bo Buchanan on the soap, and GRACE PHILLIPS, or Sarah Buchanan, who was presumed dead but surfaced recently as a released hostage, will go marketing. Sarah will shop in an environmentally sound way; Bo will not. After their foray, they will visit non-soap characters Archie and Edith Bunker to spread the word about "green" shopping.</p>
        <p>The project was the idea of JESSICA TUCK, who plays Megan Gordon-Harrison on the soap. Megan is battling lupus, and Ms. Tuck is about to leave the show.</p>
        <p>"ABC wanted me to extend my contract, and I was eager to leave, so I told them if they matched my salary and donated it to S.E.A.C., found a location to hold the benefit and helped with publicity I would stay an extra week," she said." Network executives agreed without hesitation.</p>
        <p>"Because 60 million Americans watch soaps, you cannot believe the impact a soap person has on the public and the amount of money and consciousness that can be raised through us," Ms. Tuck said. "I want to help educate a public that doesn't bump into this on an everyday basis."</p>
        <p>Ms. Tuck is certainly doing her part for the cause: she won't drink from paper cups, only mugs, for those endless cups of coffee soap characters seem to imbibe.</p>
