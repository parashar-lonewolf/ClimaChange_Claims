        <p>WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 - The hearings are over; the contentious issues are clear.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The hearings are over; the contentious issues are clear.</p>
        <p>What remains uncertain is just how or even whether the Bush administration's preferred approach to curbing pollution emissions will survive a committee vote to reach the full Senate this year.</p>
        <p>The final hearing on the Clear Skies Act of 2005 ended Wednesday with minds apparently unchanged. Nine members of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, led by its chairman, James. M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, favor the bill; nine other committee members, including one Republican, Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, prefer another approach. Mr. Inhofe promised a final version of the bill in two weeks.</p>
        <p>Three hours of testimony on Wednesday appeared to do more to highlight differences than smooth a path toward compromise. James L. Connaughton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said ''the time is now'' to pass the measure, praising what he described as its balanced approach to reducing pollution while spurring economic benefits.</p>
        <p>John D. Walke of the Natural Resources Defense Council was the only one of four witnesses who opposed the bill, calling it a dangerous rollback of current Clean Air Act statutes and a financial reward to utility companies.</p>
        <p>Senators on both sides of the issue expressed hope that bipartisanship would prevail, but none articulated a way to get there. ''Like everything else in this place, the devil is in the details,'' Senator George V. Voinovich of Ohio, a co-sponsor of the bill along with Mr. Inhofe, said after the hearing. ''A lot of things were raised; we'll look at all of them.''</p>
        <p>Some of the major points dividing committee members are these:</p>
        <p>Should a bill that sets emission limits for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury include caps for carbon dioxide, a heat-trapping gas that scientists say contributes to global warming?</p>
        <p>Are the 70 percent pollution reductions promised by 2018 deep enough and soon enough?</p>
        <p>Does the bill take a realistic approach to curbing mercury emissions when many of the smaller coal-fired power plants covered would be exempt from new mercury controls?</p>
        <p>Mr. Connaughton, a leading contender to replace Michael O. Leavitt as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, argued that the Clear Skies approach would benefit both the environment in the form of record emission cuts and the economy in the form of jobs. Its passage, he said, would bring nearly the entire country into compliance with air pollution standards, reduce the threat of costly litigation and assure that power plant operators spent $52 billion on upgrades.</p>
        <p>Abraham Breehey of the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers told the committee that ''a significant portion'' of the money would guarantee union jobs for his workers, installing pollution controls.</p>
        <p>Opposing the bill, Mr. Walke said its health costs would exceed by $61 billion those of an Environmental agency proposal developed under President Bush's first administrator, Christie Whitman.</p>
        <p>After hearing the arguments from both sides, Mr. Voinovich said: ''We need to move forward; it's important to the environment and the economy. We have to find some way to get a meeting of the minds.''</p>
