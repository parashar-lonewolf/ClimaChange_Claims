        <p>Scientists monitoring the highest levels of the atmosphere say they have detected a slowing in the rate of destruction of Earth's protective veil of ozone, the first sign that the phasing out of chemicals that harm the ozone layer is having a restorative effect.</p>
        <p>The ozone layer blocks ultraviolet radiation from the sun that can cause skin cancer and harm ecosystems. It has deteriorated for decades, especially in Antarctica, under an assault from synthetic chemicals.</p>
        <p>The phasing out of the most important class of these chemicals -- chlorofluorcarbons, or CFC's -- began in 1989 with enactment of the Montreal Protocol, an international treaty. But the destructive substances take decades to decay, resulting in the long lag before any beneficial effects could be measured.</p>
        <p>The findings, from satellite measurements, are to be published in an edition of the American Geophysical Union's Journal of Geophysical Research. They were released publicly yesterday by that private scientific group and the authors.</p>
        <p>The study's lead author, Dr. Michael J. Newchurch, an atmospheric chemist at the University of Alabama at Huntsville, cautioned that the effects had been found only in the uppermost stratosphere, where less than 20 percent of the ozone layer is situated.</p>
        <p>Dr. Newchurch also emphasized that what had been detected was just a notable slowing of the rate of ozone loss, not a reversal. It will be at least four or five decades before the ozone layer rebuilds to the levels seen before the damage started, he said.</p>
        <p>Still, Dr. Newchurch and several independent experts said the findings were a significant turning point in the fight to heal damage to the atmosphere caused by humans.</p>
        <p>''This is an important step and the first inkling of seeing something happening in the ozone itself,'' said Dr. Richard S. Stolarski, an ozone expert at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., who has seen the paper but did not take part in the research.</p>
        <p>The apparent proof that the chemical ban is starting to work shows the merits of taking concerted action against a long-term environmental threat, said Dr. Mario J. Molina, an expert on ozone chemistry at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
        <p>Dr. Molina, who shared a 1995 Nobel Prize with two other scientists for identifying the risk from CFC's 29 years ago, said the progress on curbing ozone damage was ''a very good example of human society creating a global environmental problem but then addressing it effectively.''</p>
        <p>Movement toward a ban on the harmful chemicals began with the findings in the 1970's but accelerated sharply in the 1980's after scientists found substitute compounds that were less harmful -- and particularly after a gaping seasonal hole in the ozone layer was discovered over Antarctica.</p>
        <p>Such ozone holes (actually broad areas with sharply lower concentrations) still form each fall, and smaller gaps appear over the North Pole.</p>
        <p>The recent slight improvement was detected separately by two different kinds of instruments orbiting the earth on NASA satellites, adding to confidence in the findings, Dr. Newchurch said. Over all, he said, the chance that the findings were incorrect was just 1 percent.</p>
        <p>The instruments, orbiting the earth every 90 minutes, can deduce the chemical contents of air by monitoring the sun each time it is obscured by the atmosphere. Different compounds in the air produce distinctive patterns in the wavelengths of solar radiation absorbed by the air between the satellite and the sun.</p>
        <p>For the highest part of the stratosphere, the researchers' analysis of 20 years of satellite data shows a slowing in the reduction of ozone starting in 1997 and a simultaneous slowing in the buildup of harmful chlorine from CFC's, Dr. Newchurch said.</p>
        <p>The research team included scientists from NASA, Georgia Tech, the University of Wisconsin and Hampton University.</p>
        <p>Scientists had expected the first signs of a slowing of the destruction to be seen in the uppermost layer, above 21 miles, because complicating factors like wind circulation and effects of other kinds of pollution are uncommon there.</p>
        <p>Dr. William Randel, an author of a recent report for the United Nations on ozone trends, said other factors could also affect the restoration of the ozone layer -- for example, changes in atmospheric temperature and chemistry from rising levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>Dr. Stolarski, of NASA, agreed. ''There will be more surprises,'' he said.</p>
