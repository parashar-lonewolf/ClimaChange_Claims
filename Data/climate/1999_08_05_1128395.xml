        <p>We can do it. We can keep our heads buried in the increasingly hot sand until we're all as crisp as french fries.</p>
        <p>Or we can try to raise our collective consciousness and do something about global warming.</p>
        <p>The dangerous warming of the planet Earth is already under way. Forget for a moment this summer's extreme heat and the threat of severe drought hovering over large sections of the United States. No conclusions about climate can be drawn from a single midsummer hot spell, not even from a heat wave that killed close to 200 people in the last couple of weeks of July.</p>
        <p>But consider that the Earth's average temperature in 1998 was the highest on record. And consider that 1998 was the 20th consecutive year that the Earth's surface was warmer than its recent long-term average, which is the average for 1961 through 1990.</p>
        <p>Moreover, as The Times's William K. Stevens wrote last December: ''Seven of the 10 warmest years on record have occurred since 1990 and the other three occurred after 1983. Most recently, new monthly high temperature records were set in each of the 18 consecutive months ending in October 1998.''</p>
        <p>In an interview this week, Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, chief scientist of the Environmental Defense Fund, said, ''The world we are going to live in over the next 30 to 40 years will be different climatologically than the world has been in the whole history of civilization.''</p>
        <p>By different, he means warmer. You can count on earlier springs, longer and hotter summers, more air pollution, more droughts, and more heat-related health problems and deaths. And you can count on the oceans rising.</p>
        <p>''The reason for the rise in sea levels is twofold,'' said Dr. Oppenheimer. ''Increasing temperatures cause mountain glaciers to melt. That adds water to the ocean. That's happening already. Almost all glaciers worldwide are melting. We don't know what's happening near the poles, but in the regions between the poles, almost all glaciers are melting.</p>
        <p>''Number two, water expands when it's heated, like most fluids. So the combination of those factors will cause sea levels to rise. Partly because Earth has already warmed over the last century about a degree, sea level has already risen somewhere between 4 and 10 inches. That may not sound like a lot, but on a typical East Coast beach, if you raise sea level one foot, 50 to 100 feet of land becomes permanently submerged.</p>
        <p>''The projected sea-level rise for the next century is anywhere from one foot to three feet. There's not much doubt about this part of it. Big chunks of Long Island, New England, New Jersey, right down the East Coast, are going to simply erode and disappear underwater.''</p>
        <p>There are many factors that can contribute to the warming of the globe, but most scientists are convinced that an enhancement of the naturally occurring greenhouse effect -- an enhancement caused by human activity -- is a big contributor now.</p>
        <p>''Certain gases that exist naturally in the atmosphere, like water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane and even nitrous oxide, which you know as laughing gas, keep the Earth warmer than it otherwise would be, because they are transparent to sunlight, but they trap heat that would otherwise escape into space,'' said Dr. Oppenheimer.</p>
        <p>''Because of that greenhouse effect, Earth is about 60 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than it would otherwise be. Without the natural greenhouse effect, Earth would be a frozen desert.''</p>
        <p>The problem, of course, is that various human activities in our era of industrialization are causing a buildup in the levels of some of the gases, particularly carbon dioxide, which results from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. As more and more of the gases build up, more and more heat is trapped by the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>We could get this problem under control, but that would require political leadership and a fair amount of willpower -- two qualities that currently are in spectacularly short supply.</p>
        <p>So we'll wait. Not enough people dying yet, and not enough property destroyed. We'll keep our heads in the blazing hot sand until we actually feel the flames of a full-fledged catastrophe.</p>
