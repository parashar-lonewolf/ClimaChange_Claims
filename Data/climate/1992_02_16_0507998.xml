        <p>It could have been an Arctic dawn, with numbing temperatures and muted sunlight glinting off sheets of ice on a seascape whipped by biting wind. It was 7 A.M. on the Great South Bay and Jonathan R. Mentzel was raking the bottom for clams under the appraising eyes of his yellow Labrador, Digger.</p>
        <p>Harvesting clams is an increasingly hard way of life, indeed almost an obsession, for the Long Island bayman who has been scratching a living out of the bay for 22 of his 39 years</p>
        <p>"There's something about it, -- the tranquillity, the freedom to think, the healthy outdoors, being on your own -- that goes beyond making a living, and I'm just barely doing that," Mr. Mentzel said. "At least I don't have to worry about getting laid off like a lot of other people on Long Island."</p>
        <p>The stocky, bearded bayman has an academic manner and a precise way of speaking that might more befit a high school science teacher than someone who makes a living by dangerous physical labor, all by himself.  By Hand, the Law Says</p>
        <p>Clams must be taken by hand: dredging and other mechanical harvesting are prohibited by law to prevent overfishing, although baymen say illegal, undersized clams are being taken.</p>
        <p>Some days, aboard his boat, an 18-foot, flat-bottomed open boat called a "garvey," he makes next to nothing. A full morning's haul earlier this week was 175 clams, for which he received $85.</p>
        <p>His stoicism reflects something of a tilting-at-windmills approach to life, a belief that somehow things will get better even in the face of a morning in which the wind-chill factor was below zero.</p>
        <p>"This ice is good because it masks the sound of boat engines," he insisted. "Clams are frightened by noise and dig deeper into the sand, so in very cold weather they tend to be easier to reach."</p>
        <p>But putting a positive twist on the day's frigid weather may be whistling past the graveyard. The Great South Bay clam beds are only half as productive as they were a decade ago, and competition from New England and the South is increasing. The drop in incomes has driven hundreds of clamdiggers into other occupations in recent years, and only a dozen others could be seen in the expanse of the Bay on that recent morning.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mentzel is hanging on, considering part-time jobs to augment his income. His wife, Diane, has just started work as a telephone saleswoman to help support the family; they have a son and a daughter.  When the Harvests Fell</p>
        <p>Twenty years ago, before the the boom time of Long Island clamming ended, Mr. Mentzel said, he would harvest 600 to 1,000 clams a day. No more. The reasons for the decline are not precisely known, but a study by the Suffolk County Planning Authority cited illegal clamming, changes in the salinity of the water, water pollution and a drop in reproduction.</p>
        <p>Stephen A. Hendrickson, a marine resources specialist with the State Department of Environmental Conservation at Stony Brook, L.I., said that clam harvests in the Great South Bay had dropped from a total of 117,000 bushels in 1985 to 80,000 bushels in 1990, with no increase in sight.</p>
        <p>"Clams and other shellfish have been growing very slowly in the last few years and it could be that food is a problem," Mr. Hendrickson said. He pointed out that clams feed on algae and that there seems to have been a reduction in the tiny marine creatures for undetermined reasons.</p>
        <p>Whatever the cause, Mr. Mentzel said clammers might be able to earn higher incomes if the demand for clams went up, but that "some people simply are afraid to eat them."</p>
        <p>To contradict fears, he and other baymen have formed a promotional group, Green Seal, that is seeking to both assure quality of their product and advertise Long Island clams as being the best in the country.</p>
        <p>"Most good restaurants prefer Long Island clams and if they were tagged as coming from here, people would be less reluctant to eat them," he said. Lock, Seal and Pedigree</p>
        <p>"Tagging" is closing a bag of clams with a green plastic lock-seal that has to be cut open, thus preventing Long Island clams from being mixed with with others. The seal has an identification number that codes the individual harvester, who in turn logs the origin of the lot and the date the clams were taken from the water.</p>
        <p>"The green seal tells the consumer that these aren't anonymous clams from anywhere in the country but Long Island clams that the baymen guarantee to be fresh and of top quality," Mr. Mentzel said. "If there is a problem, the serial number can trace the clams to their source."</p>
        <p>The source is the sandy bed of the Great South Bay where Mr. Mentzel has planted wooden stakes marking his favorite fishing spots. His 18-foot boat made a rasping sound as it overrode the two-inch-thick ice sheets. Mr. Mentzel maneuvered the craft to break the ice into huge chunks, so he could work the clam rake.</p>
        <p>He used a metal rake with a 20-foot long handle made from poles clamped end to end. Pulling on a clam rake is about as easy as trying to tug a newly felled log through underbrush.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mentzel pulled up oyster shells, horseshoe crabs and bricks as well as clams. The rewards are succulent little necks and cherrystones. They are manna to many native New Yorkers and have a culinary mystique perhaps unknown to outlanders from west of the Hudson.</p>
        <p>"The thing I like most about clams is eating them," Mr. Mentzel said with his face crinkled in a smile. "And the best thing about eating them is that once you start you can't eat just one. Half a dozen clams on the half shell is only a start."</p>
