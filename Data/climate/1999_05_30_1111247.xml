        <p>Those planning long jaunts by bike or foot in this city quickly realize that there is likely a bridge in their future. After all, New York, with the exception of the Bronx, is on an archipelago and has 76 bridges that span water.</p>
        <p>Knowing which are friendly to bicyclists, hikers and skaters, and which are roadblocks, can mean the difference between a harrowing and hassle-free trip. To help people plot safer crossings, Transportation Alternatives, the bicycle advocacy group, offers Fiboro Bridges.</p>
        <p>''Many people think of bridges only in terms of car traffic,'' said Ken Zirkel, who oversees the Web site. But ''biking over bridges is often the quickest, most fun and most beautiful way to get around New York.''</p>

        <p>Those planning long jaunts by bike or foot in this city quickly realize that there is likely a bridge in their future. After all, New York, with the exception of the Bronx, is on an archipelago and has 76 bridges that span water.</p>
        <p>Knowing which are friendly to bicyclists, hikers and skaters, and which are roadblocks, can mean the difference between a harrowing and hassle-free trip. To help people plot safer crossings, Transportation Alternatives, the bicycle advocacy group, offers Fiboro Bridges.</p>
        <p>''Many people think of bridges only in terms of car traffic,'' said Ken Zirkel, who oversees the Web site. But ''biking over bridges is often the quickest, most fun and most beautiful way to get around New York.''</p>
        <p>Yet some bridges, like the Verrazano-Narrows, allow only automobiles. Apart from two annual car-free events -- the city's marathon and a five-borough bike tour -- ''There is no way to cross the Verrazano under one's own power,'' the Web site reads.</p>
        <p>The same holds true for the Manhattan Bridge. Its walkways, the site says, were closed during World War II and never permanently reopened. And the pedestrian walk atop High Bridge has been sealed since the 1970's, when a rock thrown from the bridge killed a passenger aboard a Circle Line boat, according to the site.</p>
        <p>But plenty of other bridges have bike paths and walkways, and the Web site rates their surfaces and accessibility. It also dispenses inside information. With the Triboro, it reports, ''Officially, you must walk your bike over the 2+mile span. Unofficially, open for riding 24 hours a day.''</p>
        <p>WHAT YOU SEE -- The site has a large map of the city that allows visitors to highlight major bridges and bodies of water.</p>
        <p>Considering a trek from Long Island City, Queens, to Greenpoint, Brooklyn? Click on the three-mile-long tributary of the East River that splices the Brooklyn-Queens shoreline for the ''Bridges of Newtown Creek.'' One bridge to steer clear of -- noted by a bike with the red slash through it -- is the Kosciusko, a span of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway that is off-limits to bikers and walkers. But they can use the J. J. Byrne Memorial, a drawbridge along Greenpoint Avenue.</p>
        <p>Some bridges come with caveats. With the Willis Avenue Bridge, which links upper Manhattan and the Bronx, the site advises, ''metal grating makes this span inhospitable to cyclists without chutzpah.''</p>
        <p>LINKS -- Several, including one to the ''bridges and tunnels'' page of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Web site.</p>
        <p>WHAT YOU GET -- A handy reference guide to the city's bridges for those who burn calories, not fossil fuels.</p>
