        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''The Autoworkers' Pain'' (editorial, Feb. 16):</p>
        <p>Autoworkers in America are certainly hurting, but I take issue with your suggestion that investment by overseas companies has made up for job loss in our industry. There has been a net loss of 200,000 auto jobs since George W. Bush took office -- nearly 20 percent of all the auto jobs in America.</p>
        <p>Flawed trade policy is a big part of the problem, and the first step is to stop negotiating more bad trade deals that let other countries, like South Korea, maintain protectionist barriers while offering unrestricted access to American markets.</p>
        <p>You are right that laid-off factory workers should not lose access to health insurance; nobody should. What's needed is single-payer universal coverage that delivers quality care at an affordable price. This would reduce costs for manufacturers and level the playing field with foreign competitors, so that we can prevent workers from getting laid off in the first place.</p>
        <p>There is no long-term solution to the crisis in our industry that does not address environmental concerns.</p>
        <p>The U.A.W. supports a Marshall Plan for the United States auto industry that includes tax incentives for manufacturers -- from any country -- who build advanced fuel-saving vehicles and their key components in the United States. This will lessen pain all around by reducing global warming emissions and our dependence on foreign oil while creating jobs for American workers.</p>
