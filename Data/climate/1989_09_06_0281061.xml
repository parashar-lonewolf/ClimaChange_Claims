        <p>LEAD: HANDS on his hips, Gianni Nunziante stares up at the faded apricot facade of Vignamaggio, the enormous 15th-century villa he owns here in the Tuscan hills. ''When I bought this place two years ago,'' he said, ''the building was covered with ivy. We pulled tons of it down; this is the first time these walls have seen the sun in 200 years.</p>
        <p>HANDS on his hips, Gianni Nunziante stares up at the faded apricot facade of Vignamaggio, the enormous 15th-century villa he owns here in the Tuscan hills. ''When I bought this place two years ago,'' he said, ''the building was covered with ivy. We pulled tons of it down; this is the first time these walls have seen the sun in 200 years.''</p>
        <p>The newly cleaned facade of Vignamaggio - and Mr. Nunziante himself, for that matter - symbolize the new spirit abroad in Tuscany, Italy's most famous wine-producing area.</p>
        <p>Two decades ago the future of Tuscany and especially of Chianti, its most important wine, was grim. Much of the wine was mediocre, and too many people were making too much of it. Wine-making equipment was outdated and inefficient, and many vineyards - not to mention their owners - were old and tired.</p>
        <p>Wine lovers around the world had discovered northern Italy - the rich barolos and barbarescos of Piedmont, the fresh whites of Veneto and Alto Adige - and it looked as if Tuscany was becoming the forgotten region of Italian wine.</p>
        <p>No longer. Tuscany is booming; it is also chic. British retirees looking for inexpensive land and old farmhouses to restore still come -the place isn't called Chiantishire for nothing - but they have been joined by a new group, well-heeled lawyers like Mr. Nunziante from Milan and Rome, show-business people and cash-heavy foreigners, all eager to invest in castles and vineyards.</p>
        <p>From Florence in the north to Livorno in the west to Montalcino in the south, the sound of the bulldozer and the power saw can be heard in the land. Vignamaggio is fairly typical. Built at the beginning of the 15th century by the Gherardini family, the great house is said to have been the home of Mona Lisa Gherardini who later, as the wife of a Florentine merchant named Gioconda, posed for Leonardo. Wine has been made there since the house's earliest days by techniques that had changed little over the centuries.</p>
        <p>Swiftly Mr. Nunziante moved to change that. A new fermentation plant has been built behind the house. Soon the old aging casks in the cellars will be replaced and, piece by piece, the vineyards will be replanted. There is also a new tennis court, and a swimming pool is planned. Tuscan castles are not what they were.</p>
        <p>Vignamaggio's previous owners made a traditional and unexceptional Chianti, a blend of sangiovese and canaiolo, both red grapes, and trebbiano and malvasia, both white grapes. Vignamaggio, like dozens of other Chiantis, will almost certainly change that formula in the next few years. The white grapes have virtually disappeared from all the better Chiantis and canaiolo is becoming less and less popular.</p>
        <p>More and more wine makers are using 100 percent sangiovese, or sangioveto, a close relative. Others are blending sangiovese and cabernet sauvignon; still others are scorning the native varieties and making wines entirely from cabernet.</p>
        <p>The results have been mostly encouraging, and in some cases startling. The new wines are richer, more elegant and complex than the traditional Chianti blends. These lessons are not lost on newcomers like Mr. Nunziante, who are pondering which wine-making direction to take.</p>
        <p>Already committed are wine makers like Alceo di Napoli at his mountaintop home, Castello dei Rampolla. Mr. di Napoli makes a variety of wines, including an odd concoction based on locally grown traminer grapes, and even traditional Chianti.</p>
        <p>But his proudest accomplishment is Sammarco, made entirely from cabernet sauvignon and cabernet franc. It's a big, rich wine that resembles a fine French Pomerol more than it does any Italian wine. It is named after Mr. di Napoli's son, Marco, who was killed while piloting a crop-dusting helicopter.</p>
        <p>A few miles away, at Monte Vertine, Sergio Manetti, a former Milan industrialist, makes Le Pergole Torte, a wine with all the depth and breeding of Sammarco, but made entirely of the native sangiovese.</p>
        <p>''We should learn to work with our own grapes,'' Mr. Manetti said, ''not turn the whole world over to cabernet.'' Different grapes, different philosophies, two great wines.</p>
        <p>The most important innovator in Tuscany is Piero Antinori, who began creating nontraditional wines more than two decades ago. Solaia, made from cabernet sauvignon grown in Chianti, and Tignanello, a sangiovese with about 20 percent cabernet, are famous wines now. Both were created by Mr. Antinori and his enologist, Giacomo Tachis. Mr. Antinori distributes - and once made - Sassicaia, yet another cabernet sauvignon, which comes from Bolgheri, close to the Mediterranean coast.</p>
        <p>Two other unconventional Tuscan wines made from local grapes are I Sodi di San Nicolo, a 100 percent sangiovese wine, and, from Badia a Coltibuono, the delicious Sangioveto di Coltibuono. Badia a Coltibuono is an abbey-turned-winery owned by the Stucchi-Prinetti family.</p>
        <p>Not far from Badia, on a peak looking south toward Siena, is the tiny medieval village of Volpaia, where Carlo and Giovanella Mascheroni have transformed the Castello di Volpaia into one of the more charming wineries in Italy. Instead of one imposing plant, the fermenters, aging tanks and barrels are distributed among four or five buildings, one of them an old church, all connected by stainless steel tubing running under the ancient paving stones.</p>
        <p>In one way or another, all these special Chianti region wines violate the Government-backed regulations, the Denominazione Origine Controllata, stating what can go into Chianti wine. So their producers elect to call them simply vino di tavola - table wine - and forgo whatever prestige derives from the Government's approbation. No one seems to mind; certainly not the consumers. These wines are snapped up as fast as they are released, invariably at prices four to five times higher than good traditional Chiantis.</p>
        <p>Two wines made in the Chianti area are permitted to use cabernet and to have a D.O.C. rating: Carmignano and Pomino. Frescobaldi's Pomino includes sangiovese, canaiolo, cabernet and merlot; Carmignano uses sangiovese and about 10 percent cabernet. Carmignano was one of the first Italian wines to use a panel of experts to quarantee its quality. Only wines approved by the experts can carry the Carmignano name.</p>
        <p>In a sense, the Italian Government took a page from Carmignano's book. In 1983 it inaugurated its highest wine rating, the D.O.C.G., or Denominazione d'Origine Controllata e Garantita, which also required tasting panels. It has been criticized as ineffectual because instead of being reserved for a few top wines, it has been bestowed rather too widely on what are considered mediocre wines.</p>
        <p>Chianti may be the best-known wine of Tuscany - there are in fact seven Chianti regions within the Chianti zone - but it is by no means the only Tuscan red wine. Brunello, which comes from vineyards around the hill town of Montalcino, south of Siena, is Tuscany's second-best-known red and, for some connoisseurs, its most illustrious. For others, it's just another kind of Chianti, overrated and wildly overpriced.</p>
        <p>Brunello was invented, for want of a better word, in the last century by the Biondi-Santi family, whose name has been inextricably entwined with the wine ever since. Even today there are knowledgeable wine fans who are surprised to learn that Brunello is made by anyone else.</p>
        <p>Brunello is produced from the sangiovese grosso, essentially a cloned variety of the sangiovese grape. It produces a wine of considerable hardness that, for the riservas, must be aged at least three and a half years in barrels, and in fact sometimes needs 20 years or more in the bottle to be truly drinkable. Even 20-year-old bottles sometimes must be left open for three or four days to become soft enough to drink.</p>
        <p>But even in ancient Montalcino, the winds of change, fanned mostly by the dynamic Mariani brothers of Villa Banfi, are blowing. Banfi, flush with lambrusco profits, completed an enormous plant in Montalcino whose true impact will not be known for years. It's safe to say, though, that one day, thanks to them, Brunello will never again be what it was.</p>
        <p>Other Brunello producers include the Fattoria dei Barbi, Podere Emilio Costanti and Villa Banfi. Some newer producers are concentrating on earlier-maturing wines, but to get a sense of what Brunello is all about, one can try Rosso di Montalcino, the second wine of Montalcino.</p>
        <p>The white wine grape of Italy is the trebbiano, which makes up in quantity what it lacks in quality. It produces a mostly dull, uninteresting wine. Once there was a white Chianti but the use of the Chianti name for a white wine was deemed confusing and it was dropped.</p>
        <p>Probably the best white wine grape of Tuscany is vernaccia, which grows around the town of San Gimignano. The wine is fruity and has good acidity. A newcomer in Tuscany, and another Antinori innovation, is Galestro, which is now made by several large producers. It has a little bite, thanks to a touch of carbon dioxide, but it's pale and watery and has little character. This perhaps explains why it has become popular in the United States.</p>
