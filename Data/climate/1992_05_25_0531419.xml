        <p>China's economic revolution may be dotting the countryside with new factories and electricity plants, but it may also be having an unintended effect: its contribution to global warming may be rising more quickly than that of any other major country.</p>
        <p>Most countries have become increasingly aware that warming of the earth could cause climate changes and rising sea levels. Even the United States, which many scientists say contributes more to the greenhouse effect than any other country, is considering curbs on gases thought to cause global warming. The Centrality of Coal</p>
        <p>But here there is little awareness of the problem. China burns increasing amounts of coal and is expected to surpass the United States and the former Soviet Union to become the single greatest contributor of greenhouse gases in coming decades.</p>
        <p>"China will probably become the No. 2 emitter within the next 10 years," said Christopher Flavin, a climate specialist at the Worldwatch Institute, an environmental research group in Washington, D.C. "The rate of growth in China's carbon dioxide emissions is far, far greater than any major emitter anywhere in the world."</p>
        <p>Burning coal produces carbon dioxide, the most significant greenhouse gas, but coal is China's main source of energy and thus an essential element of its strategy to catch up with the industrial world.</p>
        <p>Next month at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, world leaders will try to persuade countries, particularly developing nations like China, to use less coal and to spend more on the environment.</p>
        <p>But there is no doubt that China will continue to rely on coal well into the next century, so the crucial question environmentalists are asking is, Will China be willing to curb the country's release of threatening gases, even at the possible cost of economic growth?</p>
        <p>For now, the answer is no.</p>
        <p>"China must develop, and its people must enjoy a better life, but we can't make it without energy," said Bai Xianhong, a senior official at the State Science and Technology Commission, which oversees environmental work. "You can't say that for the sake of lowering carbon dioxide emissions, China shouldn't burn coal anymore. This is impossible. In winter, people wouldn't be able to keep warm. They'd have no electricity or lighting."</p>
        <p>In wintertime, plumes of black smoke rise from millions of homes that burn coal for warmth. In major cities, where few use gas heating, a typical family may burn nearly half a ton of coal during winter. Three-quarters of China's energy comes from coal, and power generators and industrial boilers pump hundreds of thousands of tons of carbon dioxide into the air each day.</p>
        <p>"Every morning a dense black smoke streams out of the smokestack right behind our house," said a young worker who lives in Beijing. "Who's thinking of global warming, when we can barely even breathe?"</p>
        <p>Each year, China mines more than a billion metric tons of coal, more than any other country in the world. By the end of this century, the country plans to produce 1.4 billion tons each year, almost all of which it will burn at home, and by 2020, it could mine 2 billion tons a year, half the world's production.</p>
        <p>Chinese leaders say they are well aware of the pollution that unrestrained coal-burning can cause, aside from the risks of global warming. But the Government has made its position clear: It will not sacrifice development for the environment. 'Above All, Development'</p>
        <p>"You can't even talk about economic sacrifice," said Jing Wenyong, director of the Environmental Engineering Institute at Qinghua University. "Above all, we must have economic development."</p>
        <p>At last count, in 1989, China produced 9.1 percent of the gases that contribute to global warming, ranking third in the world, according to World Resources Institute, a nonprofit research group in Washington, D.C. The United States produced the largest amount, 17.8 percent; the Soviet Union followed, with 13.6 percent.</p>
        <p>On a per-capita basis, China does not even rank in the top 50 countries, the institute says; each American released nine times as much greenhouse gas as each Chinese.</p>
        <p>But if China's gross domestic product grows 8.5 percent a year for the next three decades -- unlikely but not impossible, since China's economy grew by 9.7 percent a year in the 1980's -- then by 2025, the amount of carbon dioxide released could be three times the amount released by the United States, according to estimates by the Stockholm Environment Institute. Growing More, Burning Less</p>
        <p>Scientists both here and abroad say China must improve the efficiency of its steel mills, its factories and all energy consumption if it wants to continue growing while limiting its contribution to global warming. Energy use by China's industry is among the least efficient in the world, said William U. Chandler, senior scientist at Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories, an environmental management and consulting group in Richland, Wash.</p>
        <p>"The United States is the greatest concern because it is the largest emitter now," Mr. Chandler said in a telephone interview. "But the lines will cross in the future in terms of their emissions versus ours, and they will become the largest emitter. If they do that without becoming energy efficient, they will suffer the wrath of the rest of the world the way the United States does now."</p>
        <p>While United States environmentalists take an active role in proposing measures to curb global warming, many critics say the United States as a nation has left the largest trail of pollution and done little to clean up after itself. Chinese specialists argue that it is unfair to impose constraints on China when Western countries have been polluting the atmosphere for more than a century and China has only recently become a significant offender.</p>
        <p>"It's not good enough to calculate total emissions of a year, but for the last 200 years," said Wang Mingxing, an atmospheric physicist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. "If you calculate the emissions for 200 years, China's concentration is very small."</p>
        <p>Critics of this view argue that global warming and its causes have become a concern only in recent years.</p>
        <p>To be sure, China is somewhat sensitive to environmental issues and natural resources constraints. Some experts say that China is among the most environmentally enlightened of the developing countries, and Beijing is collaborating with Western advisers to develop strategies to protect its soil, water and air.</p>
        <p>In its current five-year plan, to 1995, China sharply raised spending on the environment, but the amount still remains about nine-tenths of 1 percent of gross national product. Environmental spending in the United States runs 1 percent to 2 percent of G.N.P.</p>
        <p>China only recently acknowledged that on balance it would be hurt by global warming. It says that if the overall temperature were to rise one to two degrees, some colder agricultural areas would benefit because the extra heat and sunshine would extend the growing season. But warming could dry up crops more easily and cause droughts and hot winds in many other areas, leading scientists to say that China could lose 5 percent of its agricultural production.</p>
        <p>A warmer climate would also shrink water supplies. And a rise in sea levels could seriously damage coastal areas, the backbone of the national economy; Shanghai, the nation's biggest city, could be flooded. On parts of the Tibetan plateau in northwestern China, highways, railways and housing could tumble as the permafrost they are built on melted.</p>
        <p>Partly because of these concerns, China has set aside about $15 million for research on global warming. The Government also sees the issue as a way to broaden its role in the world, and so it has held international conferences on the environment and a special international council to examine environmental issues.</p>
        <p>"China is playing both sides of the sword," said a Western environmental specialist. "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs wants to reassert its role in the developing world. It also knows it can endear itself to the developed countries by showing it is doing a lot on the environment."</p>
        <p>China has also called upon Western countries to finance environmental improvements in developing countries, including China.</p>
        <p>While China has recently run articles and television specials on the environment in preparation for the Earth Summit, awareness of environmental problems in general is much lower than in the West.</p>
        <p>When "green" movements in the West were beginning to blossom in the 1970's and 80's, most of China had not even seen plastic. Now, in offices, conference rooms and meeting halls across China, slogans focus on developing the economy as quickly as possible.</p>
        <p>"Most people here simply don't care about the environment, especially in the township and village enterprises," said a Chinese reporter who used to cover the environment. "They don't realize it will affect their future."</p>
