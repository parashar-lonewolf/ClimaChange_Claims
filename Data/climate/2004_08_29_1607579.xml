        <p>IF he sees a man sauntering past Saks in lime-green pants, may a New Yorker safely assume that he has stumbled on a Republican from out of town, perhaps a convention delegate? How about that woman primly dressed in a below-the-knee navy blue skirt and a white blouse with sleeves? Or the fellow who asks if Ze-BAHRs sells mango bagels?</p>
        <p>The mango bagels, the green pants, the proper skirt, they are clichéd images of outlanders that many New Yorkers absorb in childhood, along with a mistrust of air they cannot smell. It is entirely possible that those people haven't a political bone in their bodies, and aren't here for the Republican National Convention. But how are New Yorkers to know? It isn't as if they have had many opportunities to sharpen their Republican-detection skills.</p>

        <p>IF he sees a man sauntering past Saks in lime-green pants, may a New Yorker safely assume that he has stumbled on a Republican from out of town, perhaps a convention delegate? How about that woman primly dressed in a below-the-knee navy blue skirt and a white blouse with sleeves? Or the fellow who asks if Ze-BAHRs sells mango bagels?</p>
        <p>The mango bagels, the green pants, the proper skirt, they are clichéd images of outlanders that many New Yorkers absorb in childhood, along with a mistrust of air they cannot smell. It is entirely possible that those people haven't a political bone in their bodies, and aren't here for the Republican National Convention. But how are New Yorkers to know? It isn't as if they have had many opportunities to sharpen their Republican-detection skills.</p>
        <p>Consider these numbers:</p>
        <p>Roughly 50,000 Republican delegates, spouses, aides and assorted hangers-on are expected to descend on New York this week. Most, if not all, will be concentrated in Manhattan, a borough where only 80,000 people voted for George W. Bush in 2000. Al Gore got five times as many votes. With this week's convention, Manhattan's political balance is about to tip, perhaps precariously.</p>
        <p>Oh, sure, we have some Republicans of our own; we even let one be part of New York City's 13-member Congressional delegation. We assign them enclaves. They are allowed to live on certain blocks of the Upper East Side, or in designated parts of Brooklyn and Queens and on Staten Island (still with us even though its people voted 11 years ago to secede). But those Republicans find Trent Lott and the House speaker, Tom DeLay, as alien as anyone else here does. They are for the most part -- how to put it? -- ethnic, just like the rest of the city.</p>
        <p>Come to think of it, there is not much point talking to New Yorkers about how to spot a visiting Republican. Most of them spend almost no time thinking about people from other parts of the country. Remember that famous Steinberg cover for The New Yorker, the one where China, Japan and all the rest are just one big lump west of 12th Avenue? You think that was meant as a joke?</p>
        <p>It might be better, then, to speak directly to Republicans -- and to visitors in general -- about how to behave while you are on our shores. Here are a few tips, some obvious, some perhaps not.</p>
        <p>First, if you approach a New Yorker, do not start by saying ''Excuse me.'' New Yorkers generally say ''excuse me'' when they want to be snide. Only it comes out ''excuuuuse me,'' with lots of 'tude. Better to walk up to a New Yorker with a hearty ''Yo!''</p>
        <p>Do not dawdle, especially in a crowded place like Times Square. That just irritates the locals, and they are not a pretty sight when grouchy.</p>
        <p>Women: always wear black at night, and if possible also during the day. Men: shave every other day, or better yet, every three days. You will look more New York hip.</p>
        <p>Try not to mention your new power lawn mower. New Yorkers will not have a clue what you are talking about. Also, do not ask a New Yorker about his handicap. He will not automatically understand that you mean golf.</p>
        <p>But it is all right to talk tee times with the former mayor. He likes the game. But try to get his name right, will you? It's pronounced Joo-lee-ON-ee, not Goo-lee-ON-ee, the way some out-of-towners say it and write it. Better yet, just say Rudy. Even New Yorkers who do not like him call him that.</p>
        <p>Look both ways when crossing the street, even on a one-way street. Especially on a one-way street. Why risk getting hit by a delivery guy or messenger going the wrong way on his bike?</p>
        <p>If you venture into the subway, a panhandler may enter your subway car and start with the standard spiel these days: ''Ladies and gentlemen, sorry for interrupting.'' It is not necessary to shout back, ''That's quite all right.''</p>
        <p>When a New Yorker expresses concern about global warming, try not to laugh, even if you feel that Gale A. Norton is the greatest interior secretary ever. In this city, people actually think this is a serious issue, not some plot to deny you your God-given right to punch holes in the Grand Canyon looking for oil.</p>
        <p>Do not even think about dese, dem and dose jokes. While were at it, fuhggedaboudit is tiresome. Forget about it.</p>
        <p>As much as you may admire Dick Cheney, you would be well advised not to use some of his recent language as a model. There is an old joke, cleaned up here, about the Texan who stops a New Yorker and says, ''Pardon me, but can you tell me how to get to the Empire State Building, or should I just go take a hike?''</p>
        <p>That does not happen, Republican visitors. We can be polite. We just have to work harder at it than some.</p>
        <p>You got a problem with that?</p>
