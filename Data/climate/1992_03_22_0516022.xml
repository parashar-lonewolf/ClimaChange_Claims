        <p>Above the stratosphere, the mesosphere and most of the thermosphere, the atmospheric layer cake enveloping the planet, the space shuttle Atlantis will be carrying scientific instruments this week to study the chemistry and physics of the air on Earth.</p>
        <p>The eight-day mission, scheduled for launching at 8:01 A.M. tomorrow at Cape Canaveral, Fla., will take measurements of the upper atmosphere and its response to natural and human-induced changes, including the accumulation of gases that trap heat and could lead to a worldwide warming.</p>
        <p>Scientists and officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said the flight of the atmospheric laboratory for applications and science, or Atlas, would be the first of a series of surveys over the next decade, all part of a program known as Mission to Planet Earth. The investigations are expected to play a critical role in global environmental policy decisions.</p>
        <p>Dr. Marsha Torr, chief mission scientist at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., said the multinational Atlas laboratory, to be operated from the shuttle's open cargo bay, is the "most comprehensive suite of instruments we have ever flown to study the atmosphere." Annual Trips</p>
        <p>The plan is for shuttles to fly the Atlas instruments every year throughout one solar cycle, the 11-year period in which the Sun goes from intense turbulence to relative calm. The Sun has just passed the peak of turbulence, a time of explosive solar flares, sunspots and other magnetic storms, and should be growing quiescent.</p>
        <p>Most of the 12 Atlas instruments are designed to investigate the influence of changing solar activity on the composition, temperature and pressure of the atmosphere at different altitudes. Scientists want to determine the fluctuations of solar heat reaching the outer layers of the atmosphere and how this drives atmospheric circulation and climate.</p>
        <p>Of particular interest will be the upper regions known as the stratosphere, from about 6 miles above the Earth to 30; the mesosphere, from 30 miles up to 60 (it is so little studied that scientists jokingly call it the "ignore-o-sphere"), and the thermosphere, the extremely tenuous layer extending to outer space at altitudes of several hundred miles. Sun Acts as Battery</p>
        <p>"The entire atmosphere is the way it is because of its interactions with sunlight, each layer absorbing different wavelengths of sunlight," Dr. Torr said in a telephone interview. "The Sun is the battery for this whole system."</p>
        <p>One instrument is designed to make infrared observations in the middle atmosphere for mapping trace molecules, including carbon dioxide and ozone. The buildup of carbon dioxide, mainly from the combustion of fossil fuels, could be creating a greenhouse effect, trapping solar heat and causing global warming. The ozone layer, which protects Earth from dangerous ultraviolet radiation, is threatened with depletion from chlorofluorocarbons used in air-conditioning, refrigeration and certain industrial processes.</p>
        <p>Other instruments are expected to provide scientists with an inventory of trace gases in the atmosphere and vertical profile measurements of ozone, methane and nitrogen compounds at altitudes of 9 miles to 93 miles.</p>
        <p>The Atlas instruments were developed by an international team of scientists from NASA, the European Space Agency, Belgium, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands and Switzerland. The cost of the mission includes $52.6 million for Atlas and as much as $400 million in shuttle expenses.</p>
        <p>The seven-member Atlantis crew will be headed by Col. Charles F. Bolden Jr. of the Marine Corps. He will be making his third space flight. The pilot will be Lieut. Col. Brian Duffy of the Air Force. The crew members operating the experiments will be Capt. David C. Leestma of the Navy; Dr. Kathryn D. Sullivan, a geologist; Dr. Byron K. Lichtenberg, a biomedical engineer; Dr. Michael Foale, a British physicist, and Dr. Dirk D. Frimont, a Belgian physicist assigned to the mission by the European Space Agency. Orbiting at 184 Miles Up</p>
        <p>They plan to fly the shuttle at an altitude of 184 miles and on an orbit covering all of the planet between 57 degrees north latitude and 57 degrees south. The pilots will be required to maneuver the shuttle more than 180 times to point the instruments in the cargo bay for the various solar and atmospheric observations. The instruments themselves will be operated by computers that will be responding to commands from scientists at the Marshall center.</p>
        <p>In what should be the most spectacular experiments, the astronauts will fire a Japanese electron-beam gun to create artificial auroras in the atmosphere below the shuttle. Televised images of the auroras will be used to investigate interactions between solar energy and atmospheric gases. Auroras are visible signatures of magnetic storms in the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>The space agency said the artificial auroras would be visible only to the astronauts and in the southern polar regions. The firing of the electron-beam gun should also produce some global radio static, which may be detectable on all continents.</p>
