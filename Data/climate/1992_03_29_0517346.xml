        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"Electrify!" makes a case that replacing the direct use of other fuels with electricity can reduce carbon dioxide emissions. In most instances, the opposite is true: replacing electricity with direct fuel use, especially natural gas, reduces such emissions, and in a very cost-effective way.</p>
        <p>This issue is not hotly contested by the major "neutral" experts. For example, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (organized by the United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization) said in a September 1990 report, "Where possible, substituting the direct use of natural gas for electricity generated by fossil fuels leads to considerable CO2 emission reduction." According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency global division, using natural gas instead of electricity for space heating, water heating and cooking could reduce CO2 emissions from this equipment by as much as 68 percent.</p>
        <p>The study cited in your article was right on one point: When you replace old equipment with new equipment, CO2 emissions are reduced. Where the study errs is attributing this reduction to the type of energy being used.</p>
        <p>There are two basic facts regarding CO2 emissions: 1) new technology is the most effective way to limit emissions, and 2) replacing electricity with natural gas almost always reduces CO2. MICHAEL BALY 3d Arlington, Va., March 12 The author is president of the American Gas Association</p>
