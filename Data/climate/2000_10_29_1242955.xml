        <p>TEDDY ROOSEVELT would have gotten an enormous kick out of the last days of this year's campaign for president.</p>
        <p>Ninety-nine years after the Republican who laid the foundations of the modern welfare state took office -- offending his own party with plans to bust big trusts while protecting those left behind in a booming economy -- the two candidates for president are caught in an age-old dispute about big government, smart government and activist government.</p>
        <p>Sure, the issues have changed. There were no personal income taxes to cut in T.R.'s day, no huge national debt to shrink, and the federal government employed only 239,476 people, a figure that, at the time, was considered an outrage. (It employs roughly 2.8 million now.)</p>
        <p>But as the campaign comes down to its last nine days, Al Gore and George W. Bush have reverted to a fundamental argument about the role of the federal government in everyday life that had Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson spitting at each other, and fueled the critics of Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, each candidate is now trying to depict the other in stereotypical terms. The Bush campaign desperately wants to cast the vice president as a Democratic caricature: spending big, promising big, regulating big and using the tax code to interfere with your life. Meanwhile, Mr. Gore's operation wants Americans to dismiss the Texas governor as a captive of big business, who will sacrifice the middle class in the name of cutting the government.</p>
        <p>Some of this fits; much does not. Al Gore is the first Democrat in memory with the luxury or the record to run on a platform of wiping out the national debt in 12 years. George W. Bush is the first Republican to try to reach the Oval Office by talking seriously about federal education standards and new prescription drug benefits.  Each candidate, in short, is striving to transform the traditional image of his own party.</p>
        <p>Just listen to the stump speeches last week. There was Mr. Bush in Arlington Heights, Ill., on Tuesday, his hand chopping the air, explaining how he would save Social Security and Medicare -- programs that, more than a half-century ago, Republican nominees for president decried as ''creeping socialism.'' (Meanwhile, he was also telling the undecided that Mr. Gore ''wants to increase the size and scope of the federal government more than Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis combined. That's pretty big.'')</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, stumping in states he should have in the bag, but doesn't, was straining to sound like T.R. himself. ''I certainly don't want to ever see another era of special interests who wield more power than the American people have,'' he told one Arkansas crowd. The next day he portrayed his opponent as the favorite of ''big oil companies and the chemical manufacturers and the other big polluters.''</p>
        <p>Viewed one way, this is another skirmish in the endless struggle in American politics between the power of government and the power of  capital. Viewed another, it is the latest pass at the debate over the merits and evils of big government. ''There's nothing in this debate we haven't heard time and time again for 20 years,'' said Alan Brinkley, a professor of history at Columbia University. ''Except for the part we've been hearing for a hundred years.''</p>
        <p>But a century ago, big government was easier to understand. When politicians talk about it these days, they are really talking about three very different things.</p>
        <p>At their most literal, they mean an expanding federal bureaucracy. Everyone's against that, until paring down a bloated federal bureaucracy means closing the local military base. But the fact of the matter is that diatribes against a big federal bureaucracy don't resonate on the stump these days the way they did in Ronald Reagan's heyday. Maybe that is because the economy is so strong. Maybe it is because the surge in federal employment on President Reagan's watch in the 1980's has been steadily reversed every year since 1990. (Of course, many federal government tasks have been shifted to the states.)</p>
        <p>Then there is the second kind of big government, the one that taxes and regulates, and uses those powers to reshape the nation. This is the kind Mr. Bush complains about most frequently, and what he says is music to tens of millions of ears. But it is also a dangerous game, because the goal posts keep changing.</p>
        <p>In the 1930's, Republicans furiously battled F.D.R.'s creation of the Social Security program. Their objections, and those of powerful businesses, led to the exclusion of millions of workers.  Now, no Republican would dare oppose Social Security or the Medicare program that followed. No one will even breathe the suggestion that these benefits might be cut. (Though they might be delayed until a later retirement age.) So the argument is an elaborate dance about whether and how to expand existing programs while remaining compassionate and conservative.</p>
        <p>''What this comes down to is pretty classic: Americans now trust government to do a lot, certainly much more than they used to,'' says Michael Kazin, a professor of history at Georgetown University, who is the author of ''The Populist Persuasion: An American History.'' ''But they are scared of it doing new things.''</p>
        <p>THEN there is the third genre of big government: an activist government, one that uses its clout to do battle with powerful private interests. But it's a role that leaves many new Democrats uneasy.</p>
        <p>The White House has made life miserable for the tobacco industry, sued the firearms makers, and made threatening noises about breaking up Microsoft. But it has also refocused the country's foreign policy to promote exports, signed more than 300 trade deals, and made the world safe for Motorola in Japan and General Motors in China.</p>
        <p>All this has changed the nature of the Democratic Party. What was the party of protectionism has become the party of export promotion, over the objections of its union supporters. It has met the microprocessor and discovered, lo and behold, that chips create millions of new jobs. Unfortunately, these same chips are made with deadly toxic chemicals that have to be dumped somewhere.</p>
        <p>SO Mr. Gore has a problem. The populist, old Democrat side of his brain wants to rail about the evils of all those chemical companies and oil firms that have, to listen to his television ads, turned Houston into the American version of Bhopal. On the other hand, he is surrounded by advisers, from former Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin to his own running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, who visibly wince when the vice president takes his corporate-bashing rhetoric too far.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, in short, wants it both ways. He wants to show he can be an old Democrat and a new Democrat. He has no problem bashing a few special interests one day, then talking up permanent research and development tax credits for them the next. He wants to preserve his environmental base -- that was the old Mr. Gore waxing eloquent about the dangers of global warming on Thursday -- while still reassuring the country that he won't put the environment ahead of economic growth.</p>
        <p>This explains why Mr. Gore, who a decade ago proposed high taxes on fossil fuels to conserve energy and clean the air, arranged last month to release 30 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to lower the price at the pump.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, meanwhile, wants credit both as a traditional Republican and a compassionate one. So he mocks Mr. Gore's targeted tax cuts for owners of energy-saving cars, saying that under his plan, almost everyone gets a lower tax bill.</p>
        <p>BUT Mr. Bush has targeted tax breaks of his own, including one to bail out farmers from the effects of low prices for their goods, another to expand education savings accounts, and another to encourage more charitable gifts.</p>
        <p>So both men have shifted away from the traditional images of their party and -- perhaps -- the expectations of how they would govern. Mr. Bush's Republicans, as he describes them, envision themselves playing a more activist role in society. And Mr. Gore's Democrats say they want to promote entrepreneurial freedom, even while regulating the market's excesses. It's easy to imagine Teddy Roosevelt ridiculing both.</p>
