        <p>The overhaul of Texas banking organizations reached a milestone as Federal regulators named a group of investors to take control of the state's last big troubled bank. National Bancshares of San Antonio, a 12-bank network that was severely weakened by problem real estate loans, will now be controlled by a group led by the Equimark Corporation of Pittsburgh. National is the last of the nine large banking companies in Texas to merge with or be acquired by new owners since December 1986.  [ Page 1. ]  Eastern Airlines filed a reorganization plan in a bankruptcy court that calls for the repayment of all debts with interest. The proposal was endorsed by virtually all of Eastern's creditors.  [ 31. ]  Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard won a round in the copyright infringement suit brought against them by Apple Computer. A Federal judge tentatively ruled that most of the visual features used in the companies' software programs were covered by a 1985 license agreement between Microsoft and Apple.  [ 31. ]  Two resignations at Kraft General Foods set up a shuffle of executives involving several large food companies.  [ 31. ]  Arthur Andersen and Information Consulting have settled their lawsuits. A suit by Andersen said the firm raided its personnel and clients; Information Consulting had filed a countersuit.  [ 32. ]  Paramount told a Delaware court that Time Inc.'s board did not respond properly to a bid from Paramount.  [ 33. ]  A plan for Allegheny International to emerge from bankruptcy was approved by the company's board.  [ 33. ] The Economy</p>

        <p>Debt talks between Mexico and bankers could resume today, a Mexican official said. Bankers said earlier that the Mexicans had at least temporarily broken off the talks.  [ 32. ] Markets</p>
        <p>A new system of corporate ratings looks at the protection companies offer to bondholders in the event of a takeover. Standard &amp; Poor's said it would evaluate the ''event-risk'' covenants that some companies have been adding to their debt offerings.  [ 31. ]  The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 2,600 for the first time in nearly two years, as last-minute program trading sent prices of blue-chip stocks sharply higher. But most other stocks were little changed. The Dow jumped 31.87 points, to 2,607.36. The gain for the week was 52.54 points.  [ 34. ]  Treasury notes and bonds had small price declines in lethargic trading, while bill rates moved up. Dealers reported little retail interest in Treasury debt issues.  [ 34. ]  Soybean futures prices fell modestly on the Chicago Board of Trade. An executive of the Ferruzzi company of Italy said the exchange had damaged the soybean market by ordering large traders to close their July positions. Ferruzzi has figured prominently in the recent chaotic trading in soybeans.  [ 40. ]  The dollar closed higher in the U.S. after a mixed performance overseas amid differing opinions about the outlook for American interest rates. Gold prices posted modest gains in the U.S.  [ 40. ] Today's Columns</p>
        <p>A new device to ward off unwanted phone calls gives a simulated busy signal to any caller who does not dial a special access code. Patents.  [ 32. ]  Durable powers of attorney are an extremely useful tool in financial planning. Many people, however, neglect to take the simple steps needed to entrust someone else with the power to handle their affairs if they become incapacitated. Your Money.  [ 32. ]</p>
