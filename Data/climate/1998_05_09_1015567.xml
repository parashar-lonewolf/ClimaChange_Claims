        <p>Re ''Scientists and Their Political Passions'' (Op-Ed, May 2): The 17,000 scientists who signed the petition opposing the global climate change accord do not deserve to be called ''a vocal minority.''

        <p>Re ''Scientists and Their Political Passions'' (Op-Ed, May 2): The 17,000 scientists who signed the petition opposing the global climate change accord do not deserve to be called ''a vocal minority.'' They are representative of the large group of highly competent working scientists who are tired of seeing well-founded traditions developed for the pursuit of scientific problems distorted beyond recognition. They finally found a way to express their opinion.</p>
        <p>The scientific community needs open controversy and balanced financing of research by constructive programs, even if they may seem to be in conflict with a political orthodoxy. Controversy among scientists, accompanied by research, lies at the heart of progress in science. In the meantime, our understanding of global warming remains unresolved.</p>
        <p>FREDERICK SEITZ  New York, May 5, 1998</p>
        <p>The writer is president emeritus of Rockefeller University.</p>
