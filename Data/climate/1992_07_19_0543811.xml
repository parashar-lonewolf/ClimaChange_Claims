        <p>Japan has adopted one of the world's most demanding programs to control global warming. It sets short-term goals and looks a full century ahead. It envisions brilliant technical fixes to capture heat-trapping greenhouse gases and bravely contemplates massive restructuring of cities and industry to lessen the threat.</p>
        <p>But is the program real -- or mostly a charade?</p>
        <p>Officials in the Bush Administration, sore at being portrayed as the world laggard in confronting global warming, incline toward the latter view. They believe the Japanese, in a craven appeal for environmental applause, are promising far more than they can deliver.</p>
        <p>But close up, the picture looks mixed. Japan's program is farsighted -- and less than it seems.</p>
        <p>For the coming decade, Japan's effort to curb emissions of carbon dioxide, the chief greenhouse gas, is more demanding, on paper, than the American program. The Japanese have set a goal of capping carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2000, whereas the Bush Administration has opposed caps and timetables, relying instead on a range of programs to reduce emissions.</p>
        <p>There is no great virtue in a cap. This page, in fact, has argued that a cap could prove needlessly costly. But the cap can also be seen as evidence of determination, and for that, the Japanese deserve high praise.</p>
        <p>The Japanese commitment, however, is much less rigorous than generally understood. Japan has not embraced the goal sought by many environmentalists and some European countries -- to hold</p>
        <p>total</p>
        <p>national emissions of carbon dioxide in the year 2000 to the levels emitted in 1990. It has made a non-binding pledge only to hold</p>
        <p>per capita</p>
        <p>emissions to 1990 levels, allowing room for emissions to grow as population grows.</p>
        <p>That might not accomplish any more than the Bush Administration programs. Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, using population estimates put forth when the pledge was made, says it will allow a 6 percent rise in total emissions. If that is the case, then Japan's emissions will rise just as much as the Bush Administration predicts American emissions will rise. The Japanese environmental agency, using more recent population projections, says emissions can rise only about 3 percent.</p>
        <p>The Japanese have also said they will make efforts to stabilize</p>
        <p>total</p>
        <p>emissions. But it seems doubtful that current policies can reach even the easier goal. Japan's energy efficiency has leveled off. The Government has shrunk from a carbon tax. And the plan relies heavily on building 40 new nuclear plants over 20 years, a rate that may be hard to sustain over growing opposition.</p>
        <p>When the decade ends, observers may well find little difference between the results achieved by Japan and the U.S. Where the two countries differ sharply, however, is on the severity of the global warming problem and the probable need for drastic solutions.</p>
        <p>Many Bush Administration officials are skeptics who shy away from corrective action, fearful that it might cause economic harm. By contrast, top bureaucrats and academics in Japan seem convinced that global warming will become serious and require drastic measures, providing profits through new technologies and efficiencies.</p>
        <p>What's truly surprising is their extremely long view. Japanese officials say, rightly, that it doesn't make much difference if Japan misses its year 2000 goals. If global warming is a long-term threat, it will have to be met by long-range policies.</p>
        <p>MITI has actually issued a 100-year blueprint that lays out, decade by decade, the key steps needed. The plan emphasizes technological breakthroughs. A new research institute is already trying to culture microorganisms to remove carbon dioxide from the air and is looking for processes to remove it from flue gases. Top officials talk matter-of-factly about restructuring industries and cities to reduce the generation of greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>Whether all that will be necessary remains uncertain. But there is little question that, if global warming does become severe, Japan will be in a better position than the United States to cope with it.</p>
