        <p>BP this week introduced targetneutral.com, a program that enables drivers in Britain to determine how much carbon dioxide pollution they helped create, and to offset it by supporting green energy initiatives. The goal is to make drivers ''CO2 neutral.''</p>
        <p>The idea is not new. There are similar programs from TerraPass (terrapass.com), Cooldriver.org and Green Cards (b-e-f.org), operated by environmentalists.</p>
        <p>BP's timing did not go unnoticed. The Financial Times reported this week that the Environmental Protection Agency was investigating accusations that BP manipulated data to avoid having to replace pipelines in the Prudhoe Bay oil field in Alaska. BP shut some of those pipelines, saying that they were corroded.</p>
        <p>Representative Joe Barton, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said in an Aug. 11 letter to Lord Browne, chief of BP, that the shutdown was a result of ''chronic neglect.''</p>
        <p>''What a coincidence that this should come amid allegations of 'chronic neglect','' wrote a commenter at Metafilter.com. Another critic was not impressed with the projects the BP program will help finance. ''Color me skeptical,'' the Metafilter poster wrote. ''They list four active projects, none of which strike me as particularly massive in scale.''</p>
        <p>Others see the program as a way for drivers of gas-guzzlers to assuage their guilt, but avoid taking responsibility for owning huge vehicles.</p>
        <p>But the cynicism isn't universal. ''While emission trading is nothing new, it is always encouraging to see industry leading the way,'' wrote Kevin Grandia of the Desmog Blog (desmogblog.com).</p>
        <p>CAN'T LIVE WITH 'EM -- In February, Michael Noer, the executive editor for news of Forbes.com, wrote an article that began this way: ''Wife or whore? The choice is that simple.''</p>
        <p>The article was discovered Wednesday by people who grew curious about Mr. Noer for another article he wrote this week. In it, he warned men against marrying ''career girls,'' which he defined as college-educated women making more than $30,000 a year and working 35-plus hours a week. Forbes.com withdrew the articles on Wednesday after Gawker (gawker.com) and other bloggers began complaining loudly.</p>
        <p>Both are based on studies that ostensibly support Mr. Noer's theses: that wives and prostitutes are substitute ''goods'' and that career women are bad for marriage. Most of those studies ''came from conservative think tanks,'' wrote Rebecca Traister in Salon (salon.com).</p>
        <p>In the earlier article, Mr. Noer wrote that the ''implication'' of one study was that ''wives and whores are -- if not exactly like Coke and Pepsi -- something akin to champagne and beer. The same sort of thing.''</p>
        <p>The headline on this week's article, ''Don't Marry Career Women,'' not only assumes that Forbes.com is read only by men, but also that women's careers, not men's, are what pose challenges for marriages.</p>
        <p>In Slate, Jack Shafer asserted that while Mr. Noer's articles were misleading and drew conclusions that were wildly off base, they weren't sexist (slate.com). Perhaps Mr. Shafer only skimmed the articles, missing such tidbits as Mr. Noer's assertion that ''your house will be dirtier'' if you marry a woman with a career.</p>
        <p>By Thursday, Forbes.com had repackaged the newest article as part of a debate on the issue, adding an article by the columnist Elizabeth Corcoran titled ''Don't Marry a Lazy Man.''</p>
        <p>STICKY SITUATION -- Darmin Garcia, a worker at a chocolate factory in Kenosha, Wis., fell into a vat of 110-degree chocolate last Friday and was stuck there for over two hours. He was saved because of his co-workers' knowledge of chocolate.</p>
        <p>They added cocoa butter to the vat to thin the dark chocolate that trapped Mr. Garcia, whose pants had become stuck on a roller, recounted The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel (jsonline.com).</p>
        <p>The now-lighter chocolate was scooped out and Mr. Garcia removed his pants to free himself.</p>
