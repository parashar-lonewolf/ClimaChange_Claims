        <p>Every year, when Robert and Barbara Smith drive from their home in Pennsylvania to the Finger Lakes for a family getaway, they almost always stop by a sprawling preserve here to glimpse the largest known herd of rare white deer.</p>
        <p>''I look at them again and again, and I'm always fascinated by them,'' Mrs. Smith said. ''They're beautiful.''</p>
        <p>But today conservationists fear the herd may be imperiled because of plans to build a $115 million ethanol and biofuel electricity production center on the deer preserve. It would create as many as 150 jobs in an area that greatly needs them.</p>
        <p>For years, a group of conservationists tried to turn the land, which sits on a former Army munitions depot, into a tourist attraction. Yet now the group, which would ordinarily embrace an ethanol plant because of its intended purpose of not burning fossil fuels, is rallying against it.</p>
        <p>''This is a grave situation,'' said Dennis J. Money, the chairman of the conservation group Seneca White Deer. ''This is the only place in the world you can see 300 white deer. A herd like this will probably never happen again.''</p>
        <p>The ethanol plant developers plan to buy 4,700 acres, or nearly half of the land, enough space for the plant as well as crops of willow trees and switch grass that would be converted to fuel.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Money thinks the developers' proposal presents too much risk to the rare deer. He said that his group does not want to stop the ethanol center from being built but wants it moved to the rim of the property, with the bulk of the land left intact to be the herd's food supply and cover.</p>
        <p>He said that if the group were not able to persuade the owners of the proposed ethanol project to revise their plans, it would file a lawsuit next month in state court, claiming that the development agency rushed the plans forward without properly notifying the public and violated state laws when it ruled the ethanol center would not adversely affect the existing environment.</p>
        <p>Developers and local business leaders insist the ethanol plant, which was first proposed in December and could start going up as early as this spring, will not harm the deer.</p>
        <p>''We are all environmentalists,'' said Glenn R. Cooke, the executive director of the Seneca County Industrial Development Agency, which must approve the project. ''We're not doing any detriment to the deer herd.''</p>
        <p>In 1941, the Army built the Seneca Army Depot, with hundreds of munitions bunkers on 10,600 acres of farmland parallel to Seneca Lake, but much of the land was untouched. A fence around the perimeter allowed the wildlife, including the deer, to flourish.</p>
        <p>Because white deer are easy prey, such a herd would not survive in the wild. The deer are not albinos, but a rare form of the breed. Most of the deer are white-tailed, but some carry a recessive gene allowing for offspring with white coats.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith, a firefighter, first saw the deer when he worked as a military policeman at the depot from 1980 to 1982. ''I've never seen anything like it anywhere else,'' he said.</p>
        <p>After the Persian Gulf war of 1991, the Army closed the depot and eventually transferred ownership to the Seneca County Industrial Development Agency.</p>
        <p>Agency leaders have been looking to develop the land since. Twice they rejected the conservationists' proposal to turn it into an environmentally friendly tourist attraction with tours and hiking trails and a Cold War museum with the bunkers.</p>
        <p>The ethanol proposal was the first to not only benefit the environment but also create well-paying positions for computer operators and technicians, Mr. Cooke said. ''Ethanol makes sense,'' he said. Public hearings were scheduled for this week.</p>
        <p>Empire Green Biofuels, one of the plant's developers, said that it was committed to ''maintaining the habitat of the locally famous white deer population,'' and that the deer would adapt to the center.</p>
        <p>Still, the conservationist group is trying to create enough public pressure to have the plant built on the eastern rim of the grounds, near a state prison. And it would like to have the willow crop planted somewhere other than the center of the former depot.</p>
        <p>But if the plans move forward unaltered, Mr. Money said his group would follow through with a suit. ''They are impacting 4,700 acres of land,'' he said. ''How can they say the land is not impacted?''</p>
        <p>Scott McPeak, 43, who traveled here from central Ohio last October to take a bus tour of the depot that was organized by the Seneca White Deer group, said he was disheartened to learn of the proposed ethanol center. ''That's kind of a waste of a resource you have,'' Mr. McPeak said. ''If you own the best ski mountains in Colorado, you don't level them to build a golf course.''</p>
