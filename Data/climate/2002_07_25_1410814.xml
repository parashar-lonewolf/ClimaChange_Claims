        <p>THE locals call the redwood house set on stilts the Jetson House because of its futuristic look. When it was built in 1958, it had the only private tennis court on City Island, perhaps the only private court in the East Bronx. Even the neighboring yacht club had no tennis court. (It still doesn't.)</p>
        <p>Now the Jetson House has lost its tennis court and gained a garden. ''My wife, Doris, is an alchemist,'' said Roger Straus III, a 58- year-old architectural photographer. ''She creates beauty and magic out of zilch. Of course, I might have played at Wimbledon, but I gave it all up for her.''</p>
        <p>The Strauses may have the answer for those whose backhands and enthusiasm for tennis has flagged. Dig up the 36-by-78- foot tennis court and plant the garden of your dreams.</p>
        <p>A garden is no easier on the back than tennis, but it certainly is easier on the eyes. And it really doesn't take all that much to convert a hard-to-maintain clay court into a medium-maintenance Eden. ''Just close your eyes and say, 'Yes, dear,' to $9,000 worth of dirt,'' Mr. Straus said, grinning.</p>
        <p>How much dirt is that? ''I stopped counting dump trucks after 10,'' said Mrs. Straus, who is 47.</p>
        <p>It may not even be fair to apply the term ''dirt'' to the yards and yards of topsoil, sand and compost with plenty of organic amendments rototilled in. The garden grew to encompass most of the yard, and the neighbors, some of whom had feared the Strauses were replacing the tennis court with multifamily dwellings, were wholly mollified by rich brown beds of well-raked soil. The neighborhood suddenly smelled as sweet as an organic farm.</p>
        <p>Mr. Straus left the publishing house his father helped found, Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, in 1993. Mrs. Straus was also in publishing, specializing in book design and art direction. In 1993 she left to work for the New York Botanical Garden, where it was her great good luck to be assigned to the Peggy Rockefeller Rose Garden. She pruned, tied up, planted and fertilized roses from March to October, and by the time she left in 2001 she had learned from some masters, among them Mario and Benny Bulfamanti, landscape contractors from New Rochelle.</p>
        <p>In 1999, when she and her husband bought their year-round house on City Island on a 150-by-100-foot waterfront lot, they were told it was built on landfill from the Bruckner Expressway. So when the Bulfamantis dug up the tennis court and found a conglomerate of broken asphalt, concrete, bits of glass and parts of toys, the Strauses knew the loads of soil were just the start.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Straus first considered planting only large flowering shrubs, but didn't have the discipline to ignore the siren call of vibrant annuals and perennials. Besides, the house was too contemporary for something formal like trimmed boxwood parterres. (''Boxwood would fry in this stiff west wind,'' she said.) She settled on a series of wholly appropriate 1950's amoeba-shaped beds, laced with dirt paths. Having laid these out, she did what the best landscape books recommend and sited her garden's ''bones,'' big Leyland cypresses and some large viburnums.</p>
        <p>Mr. Straus suggested a fountain. Nothing with spitting dolphins or burbling cherubs, perhaps something more gritty and ''millstone-y,'' like the hewn-stone fountain the couple found in a catalog from Stone Forest, a garden ornament company in Santa Fe, N.M. With the centerpiece in place, Mrs. Straus put a stick in the ground, attached a string and drew a nine-foot circle, the outline for an eight-inch-deep, rubber-lined recirculating pool. Then she dug the pool, herself.</p>
        <p>Now came the roses -- almost 60 to date -- set in the borders among the airy things like artemesia and perovskia that conveniently cover a multitude of black-spot-denuded stems. No one can accuse her of being daunted by the ''crunchy granola, Birkenstock types'' she said she met at the New York Botanical Garden, those folks who complain that roses are unnatural-looking and require high maintenance. (They are, she said, but they are worth it.)</p>
        <p>Her current favorite is Rosa chinensis Mutabilis, which changes color (hence, ''mutabilis'') as it ages. She's a fan of all those ''tender'' China and tea roses, saying, ''We might as well make the best of global warming.'' She also likes a lavender floribunda rose called Blueberry Hill. Mrs. Straus does some mail-order shopping, but prefers to buy from Tony's in Larchmont, where she said, ''the quality is amazing.''</p>
        <p>Seeds come from the austere black-and-white catalog of J. L. Hudson in La Honda, Calif., a scholarly pamphlet by a curmudgeon who admonishes, ''Don't buy what you don't need,'' and announces: ''I have no business or personal telephone. Please do not call me or anyone named Hudson in the directory,'' and ''If the phone doesn't ring, it's me.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Straus has old-fashioned poppies that grow three feet tall in June and seed themselves, and Oriental lilies that are breathtakingly fragrant. Among hundreds of possible day lilies, she is partial to Chancellor, to tall, crisp August Orange (''Like a slice of orange,'' she said) and to the day lilies that rebloom in the fall, like a lemony, ruffled cultivar named, well, Doris Straus. (One of the perks of working at a garden that hybridizes day lilies is that occasionally one is named after you.)</p>
        <p>This magical garden filled with roses and poppies, lilies, coreopsis, ferns, phlox, sedums, hostas, verbascums and pinks took only two summers to become whoppingly huge and healthy, an accomplishment that inspires awe. And Mrs. Straus is now looking for a new challenge. Those courts in Flushing Meadows are probably safe, but she has been eyeing a scraggly empty lot across the street.</p>
