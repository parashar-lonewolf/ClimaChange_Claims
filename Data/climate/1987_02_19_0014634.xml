        <p>LEAD: An internal report suggests that the Environmental Protection Agency may be concentrating on the wrong problems, such as hazardous wastes, rather than more serious threats posed by air pollution and depletion of the ozone.</p>
        <p>An internal report suggests that the Environmental Protection Agency may be concentrating on the wrong problems, such as hazardous wastes, rather than more serious threats posed by air pollution and depletion of the ozone.</p>
        <p>The report, which was requested by Lee M. Thomas, Administrator of the agency, in an effort to review its priorities, was prepared by 75 of the agency's senior professional staff members.</p>
        <p>The report found that the problems posing the greatest overall risk to human health and the environment in the United States included such conventional air pollutants as sulfur and lead, the destruction of ozone in the atmosphere by man-made chemicals and the risk from pesticides, especially pesticide residues on foods. Other Health Hazards Cited</p>
        <p>Other problems that had a particularly severe impact on health included radon and other indoor air pollution, toxic air pollutants, contamination of drinking water and exposure of workers to dangerous chemicals.</p>
        <p>Such problems as the disposal of toxic waste or the cleanup of abandoned toxic waste sites and other causes of contaminated water presented a medium or relatively low level of overall risk, according to the agency's study.</p>
        <p>''These rankings by risk do not correspond well with the E.P.A.'s current program priorities,'' the report said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thomas said in an interview today that the study of the relative risks of environmental problems could lead his agency to modify some of its priorities. He also said the study might persuade Congress to rethink how best to allocate ''finite resources'' to deal with environmental problems. Major Restructuring Unlikely</p>
        <p>But Mr. Thomas insisted that the study did not indicate that the agency had been on the wrong course or that there should be a major restructuring of its programs.</p>
        <p>He suggested rather that the success of such programs as the handling of hazardous materials and the cleanup of toxic wastes might be one reason for the relatively low ranking they received in the agency's assessment of environmental risks.</p>
        <p>The report said that areas of relatively high risk but low effort by the agency include radon, a naturally occurring gas that accumulates in homes and can cause lung cancer; other indoor air pollution caused by heating appliances, formaldehyde and other sources; the destruction of the ozone layer that protects the earth's surface from dangerous ultraviolet radiation, and global warming caused by the buildup of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels and from other gases in the atmosphere, preventing the escape of infrared radiation from the sun.</p>
        <p>Other areas where the report found high risks but relatively little regulatory effort by the environmental agency were runoff of polluted water from farms and city streets, exposure to pesticides, exposure of workers to toxic substances and accidental releases of poisonous chemicals. 'High Effort, Low Risks'</p>
        <p>Areas of ''high E.P.A. effort but relatively low risks'' included management of hazardous wastes, the cleanup of chemical waste dumps, the regulation of underground storage tanks containing petroleum or other hazardous substances and municipal solid waste.</p>
        <p>In recent years the agency has been expending a considerable effort on toxic waste problems; last year Congress renewed the toxic waste cleanup law, providing $9 billion for the program over the next five years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thomas said that in recent years the agency started to move aggressively on many of the problems identified as presenting high risks, including pesticide contamination, stratospheric ozone and the ecologicial as well as the health consequences of pollution. He also said efforts to control conventional air pollution, identified as a high-risk area, had been a focal point of the agency's efforts for 15 years.</p>
        <p>Richard D. Morgenstern, director of the agency's office of policy analysis and coordinator of the report, said the report was ''not an indictment of current programs but a forward look into the future.''</p>
        <p>Many factors other than relative risk determine agency policy on a given problem, he added. These factors include statutory requirements, public demands and economic and technological feasibility of efforts to deal with the problems. Praise From Environmentalists</p>
        <p>The study is drawing considerable praise from environmentalists and Congressional staff aides who know about it. For example, Terry Davies, executive director of the Conservation Foundation, called the report ''an extraordinarily courageous thing to do,'' because it runs against the self-interest of the agency's bureaucracy.</p>
        <p>Two Congressional aides also said it was highly useful but very unusual for a Federal agency to take stock of what it was doing.</p>
