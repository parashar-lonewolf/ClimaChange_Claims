        <p>MARCHING slowly northward toward the Siberian tundra, a vast army of larch trees is a key suspect in one of climatology's most pressing mysteries: the whereabouts of the nearly two billion tons of carbon dioxide that disappear each year into something other than thin air.</p>
        <p>And though their feathery, yellow-green leaves fluttered to the soil months ago, the Russian larches are regarded as a symbol of hope by many climate scientists, of the chance that some unpredictable natural mechanism will moderate an otherwise inexorable trend toward a warmer world.</p>
        <p>But they are quick to add that the Russian forest, which accounts for one-fifth of the world's trees, could just as easily stand for something else: the many uncertainties facing a young science being asked to make forecasts about a system that is, after all, as complicated as the earth itself.</p>
        <p>While the larches and other forests in the Northern Hemisphere appear to be retarding global warming, researchers say, it is also possible that in a few decades they could be accelerating it.</p>
        <p>Call it the case of the missing sink -- carbon sink being the term climate scientists use for anything that absorbs and retains carbon dioxide. In the late 1970's, carbon sinks were just arithmetic, pursued by oceanographers and ecologists who were trying to account for all the terms in the earth-air carbon budget. They totted up sources of CO2 and subtracted the amount absorbed by known sinks, like the ocean, to predict how fast mankind's outflow should translate into atmospheric accumulations.</p>
        <p>The figures didn't add up. Carbon was missing -- lots of carbon. Last year the missing sink was an estimated 1.8 billion tons of carbon, more than one-fifth of the 8.1 billion tons of the gas pumped out that year by human activity, according to the latest data compiled by Pieter P. Tans of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory, in Boulder, Colo.</p>
        <p>In a 1990 paper published in Science, Dr. Tans, with Dr. Taro Takahashi of the Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory and Dr. Inez Y. Fung of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, proposed that the forests and soils of the Northern Hemisphere must be the missing sink.</p>
        <p>Scientists have since concluded that this sink's increased absorption of carbon is a feedback mechanism from increased carbon dioxide levels in the air.</p>
        <p>Through photosynthesis, all green plants absorb carbon to grow. Higher levels of carbon in the air fertilize larger, faster-growing trees. Despite the widespread deforestation drawing attention in the tropics, across the Northern Hemisphere there are a lot more trees. With the decline of lumbering across parts of Canada, the United States and western Russia, and the removal of other lands from agricultural use, trees are growing again on millions of hectares.</p>
        <p>And the rise in global temperatures that many scientists already attribute to mankind's carbon emissions has extended the range of trees like the larch northward.</p>
        <p>Some important confirmation came when Dr. Olga N. Krankina left the St. Petersburg Forest Academy for Oregon State University, bearing analyses of decades of detailed data kept by Soviet forest rangers, which she turned into estimates of these forests' carbon storage.</p>
        <p>In a 1996 paper, Dr. Krankina estimated that Russia's forests could absorb up to 2 billion more tons of carbon, between forest regrowth and expansion on the northern frontier -- an amount she says is equal to three years of Russian fossil fuel emissions.</p>
        <p>Such comparisons have led forest-rich industrial nations like the United States to argue that the carbon their sinks absorb should be counted against the amount their power plants and factories emit in computing targets for reductions.</p>
        <p>But leading scientists warn against putting too much reliance on forests. James E. Hansen of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York noted that no one has much of a clue as to how feedback mechanisms would work under conditions never before experienced. It's possible, he said, that something that is now a sink could ''fill up,'' or could even become a net source of carbon. The behavior of sinks could make the difference between manageable climate change and potential catastrophe, he said.</p>
        <p>FOR her part, Dr. Krankina acknowledged in a recent interview that for the Russian forests to absorb those extra 2 billion tons of carbon would require ''all the cleared land to be regenerated and maintained, and the extent of fire will have to be reduced,'' although Russian forest rangers' budgets have been starved in their country's recent economic turmoil. And even under such ideal conditions the forest sink would soon slow its growth, meaning that the projected 2 billion tons would do little more than buy a few years' breathing space.</p>
        <p>Indeed, just as the Russian forest's northern fringe holds out hope, trees are dying on its southern edge, in what could be a preview of the effect of higher temperatures.</p>
        <p>Last year in southern Siberia, Herman H. Shugart of the University of Virginia saw ''hundreds of square miles of dead trees,'' killed by silkworms and bark beetles, whose range has been growing. Dead trees are vulnerable to fires. In the long run, Dr. Shugart said, ''You just don't know how those terms in the carbon budget equation are going to work out.''</p>
