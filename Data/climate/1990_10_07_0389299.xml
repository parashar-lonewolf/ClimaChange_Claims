        <p>LEAD: AT THE FAIRVIEW LAKE Y.M.C.A. camp near the Delaware Water Gap in rural New Jersey, children come from the New York suburbs for a few weeks of fresh air and exercise.

        <p>AT THE FAIRVIEW LAKE Y.M.C.A. camp near the Delaware Water Gap in rural New Jersey, children come from the New York suburbs for a few weeks of fresh air and exercise. They rise early to swim, ride horses, learn archery and play soccer and softball. The camp is many miles from any industry, and there might seem no healthier place for youths to spend a summer. But researchers from the Institute of Environmental Medicine at New York University began a study there in July 1988 to determine whether that was really so.</p>
        <p>Twice a day, in the morning before going outdoors and again shortly before dinner, 72 children between the ages of 7 and 14 were asked to exhale into a spirometer, an instrument that gauges air flow from the lungs. The researchers found that there was enough of a pollutant gas called ozone in the air at ground level to impair lung function in fully 70 percent of the campers. Ozone pollution - as distinguished from the naturally occuring ozone in the upper atmosphere, which shields the earth from harmful ultraviolet rays - is formed from a combination of car exhaust and other emissions reacting with sunlight. ''Ozone was irritating the children's lungs, constricting them,'' says Dailia M. Spektor, a physicist and researcher on the project, explaining that it interfered with the lungs' ability to absorb oxygen.</p>
        <p>The impairment was still evident in the morning, when ozone levels had dropped from the previous day's high. ''We were very surprised by the findings because this is the first scientific data showing that the effects of ozone are still measurable 18 hours after exposure to the pollutant,'' says Spektor. ''The trillion-dollar question is, what are the long-term effects of reduced lung function?'' To that question, there is still no definitive answer. But the suspicion is that even small changes in the lungs' capacity to absorb oxygen may be a sign of cell damage and inflammation that could lead to chronic respiratory illness.</p>
        <p>From many studies like this one, a consensus is emerging that although the Clean Air Act, which became law 20 years ago, has brought about some significant improvements, air pollution at levels still frequently found in American cities, towns and even rural areas is more dangerous to human health than previously recognized. There is a financial price as well. The American Lung Association estimates that the annual cost of air pollution in terms of medical care and days lost at work because of illness and premature death has reached the level of more than $40 billion.</p>
        <p>It seems clear to scientists and health experts that not enough progress has been made on limiting dangerous pollutants like ozone. Moreover, many other toxic airborne substances, including various pesticides and formaldehyde, which is used in the manufacture of dyes, plastics and resins, are still not regulated at all. Scientific studies have established that more than 300 kinds of emissions in the air Americans breathe can cause health damage. Yet only seven are controlled by the Government, largely because of legal challenges from industry and the difficulty of proving that any particular substance poses a significant health risk. To better address these hazards, Congress and the Administration have been at work for much of the year on an amendment, crucial to Americans' health, to the Clean Air Act.</p>
        <p>RESEARCH IS NOW showing a correlation between air pollution and not only respiratory diseases but also heart disease, cancer and a weakened immune system. A number of major epidemiological studies indicate that for vulnerable people - among them, people with heart disease or asthma and the elderly - the air in some parts of the country can at times be life-threatening. Indeed, health departments advise such people to stay indoors on days when pollution levels are high. ''Research says that air pollution is dangerous to our health, and it affects people in urban areas and in the countryside,'' says William K. Reilly, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. ''One solution has been to tell certain groups of people to stay inside on days when pollution levels pose a particularly high health risk. But that is not my vision of what society ought to offer.''</p>
        <p>University and Government studies suggest that doing any kind of aerobic exercise in polluted air aggravates the health threat, because people take in more air when they exercise. ''There are suspicions that people's lungs are being permanently impaired,'' says Donald H. Horstman, a physiologist at the E.P.A.'s Health Effects Research Laboratory. Accordingly, even people who are not in a high-risk group are now being advised to avoid exercising outdoors when some kinds of pollution, particularly ground-level ozone, exceed Federal standards. (Such advisories can be obtained from many local weather reports.) Ground-level ozone is clearly the most widespread air-pollution problem. Epidemiological studies have linked it with a high frequency of hospital treatment for respiratory difficulties. There is also a correlation between ozone exposure and asthma attacks, which occur more frequently and can be more severe at a level of 0.15 parts per million, which is often reached in many parts of the country. Children are especially at risk of respiratory problems, because, for their body size, they inhale several times more air than adults, and because they tend to spend more time outdoors playing.</p>
        <p>Even healthy adults suffer damage to the bronchial passages from ozone, according to numerous studies by Horstman and his colleagues at the E.P.A. In one study of men who do not smoke, after about five hours of walking briskly and then bicycling in a room where ozone was at or close to the Federal maximum - levels often recorded even in suburban and rural towns - about 80 percent of the men began to cough and feel chest pains when they inhaled, and they could not inhale as much air as they normally could. In another study, after exercising for two hours in a room where the level of ozone was well below the Federal maximum, about 80 percent of the men showed several potentially serious symptoms in their lower airways. The airways became inflamed, making them more vulnerable to infection, and the tissue underwent various biochemical changes indicating that the immune response might have been compromised. The researchers reported no adverse effects in men who exercised in an ozone-free environment.</p>
        <p>In Los Angeles, which has by far the worst ozone problem in the United States, Dr. Russell P. Sherwin, a pathologist at the University of Southern California School of Medicine, sought to assess the effect of ozone on the lungs. In 1988 he performed autopsies on 107 people between the ages of 15 and 25 who had died in car accidents or homicides and found that half had lesions on their lungs that were characteristic of the early stages of lung disease. Dr. Sherwin allowed that some of the lung damage could have been caused by smoking, viral infections or other environmental hazards like dust. But he concluded that the high level of ozone in the Los Angeles air must have played a role because the lesions he saw were similar to those that other studies have induced in animals by exposing them to the pollutant. ''There should be no question in anyone's mind that air pollution had some effect on these lesions,'' Dr. Sherwin says. ''What we don't know is the magnitude of the role.''</p>
        <p>Nitrogen dioxide, another of the six airborne pollutants already regulated by the Clean Air Act, has an effect on the body similar to but milder than ozone's. Produced by burning fossil fuels in vehicles and industrial plants, it interferes with the functioning of the lungs and lowers resistance to infectious diseases.</p>
        <p>Acid particles, formed from sulfur dioxide emissions of power-generating and other industrial plants, are perhaps the most lethal of the six regulated pollutants. Many epidemiological studies show a link between high levels of sulfur dioxide and a higher than normal death rate. This pollutant aggravates respiratory and cardiovascular disease and is associated with significant constriction of the bronchial passages in asthmatics. Vulnerable people should stay indoors and refrain from physical activity on days when sulfur dioxide levels are high.</p>
        <p>Sulfur dioxide also combines with moisture in the air to become droplets of highly concentrated sulfuric acid, called acid aerosols. Toxic metals and gases can bind with these tiny droplets to make them even more lethal as they penetrate deep into the lung tissues. Researchers at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard say acid aerosols may account for up to 5 percent of deaths in the United States - or 100,000 a year. - Another study of children at camp - Camp Kiawa, on the north shore of Lake Erie in rural Canada - measured the effects of ozone and of acid particles formed in the atmosphere from sulfur dioxide. In a study led by Mark E. Raizenne, an environmental researcher with Canada's Health and Welfare Department, 112 girls between the ages of 8 and 14 were monitored for the amount of air they could exhale as well as the rate at which they exhaled. The ability of the campers' lungs to absorb oxygen decreased an average of 7 percent on days when air pollution was highest. On such days, Raizenne found, the campers also showed small declines in performance on a standardized exercise test. He estimates that up to 80 million people in the United States live in areas where the concentration of acid particles is comparable to that at the camp.</p>
        <p>In a long-term study begun in 1976 by the Harvard School of Public Health, children in six cities with varying levels of acid-particle pollution have been monitored annually for respiratory function. The six cities are Portage, Wis.; Topeka, Kan.; Watertown, Mass.; Kingston/Harriman, Tenn.; Steubenville, Ohio, and St. Louis. Four percent of the children suffered from bronchitis in the city with the lowest acid-particle pollution level (Portage), compared with 12 percent in the city with the highest level (Kingston/Harriman).</p>
        <p>Carbon monoxide, another health hazard, is a colorless and odorless gas produced by the incomplete burning of fuel. Cars, trucks and buses account for about two-thirds of the carbon monoxide emissions in the United States. The remainder comes from fuel combustion in heating and industrial processes. At highest risk to carbon monoxide poisoning are people with chronic respiratory diseases like bronchitis, emphysema and asthma, the elderly, and people with cardiovascular disease or anemia. Dr. Sidney Gottlieb at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine has found that exposure to levels of carbon monoxide commonly found in cities may cause measurable cardiac effects.</p>
        <p>Extended exposure to levels of carbon monoxide that are low enough to comply with the E.P.A. standard can interfere with visual perception, dexterity and the ability to learn and perform complex motor tasks. These levels of carbon monoxide can also cause men with heart disease to experience chest pains when they exercise vigorously, according to studies by Dr. David S. Sheps, a professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill. Another study, published in The New England Journal of Medicine last year, found that patients with atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries, may be affected by low levels of carbon monoxide.</p>
        <p>Other than the six major ambient air pollutants, the Environmental Protection Agency lists only seven airborne toxins - arsenic, benzene, radionuclides, asbestos, beryllium, mercury and vinyl chloride - as hazardous. Emission standards have been set for only the last four chemicals on the list, yet they have all been shown to cause cancer or damage to the nervous system.Benzene, for example, a solvent with many applications, including petroleum refining and the manufacture of plastics, rubber, dyes and drugs, is known to cause leukemia. And the agency estimates that there are perhaps 300 other toxins in the air in addition to those listed under the Clean Air Act; some of them are known to cause cancer. Tetrachloroethylene, for example, a solvent used in dry cleaning, has been linked to liver cancer.</p>
        <p>Other health problems, such as skin cancer and cataracts, may be caused indirectly by the emission of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's, which are used primarily in making refrigerants. These chemicals break down in the stratosphere to release free chlorine, highly damaging to the protective ozone shield. Corporations and governments of the world are trying to work out a deadline by which CFC's can be phased out.</p>
        <p>SO WHAT PROGRESS HAS been made?</p>
        <p>There have indeed been some dramatic gains, largely because of the Clean Air Act, which required the use of unleaded gasoline and the installation of desulfurization devices on new coal-fired generating stations.</p>
        <p>Levels of four of the six airborne pollutants regulated by the act - lead, carbon monoxide, particulates and sulfur dioxide - are down significantly. Levels of two - ozone and nitrogen dioxide - are not. The most dramatic strides have been made in cutting the level of airborne lead, which was reduced by almost 90 percent between 1979 and 1988. This was largely a result of a reduction in the amount of lead in leaded gas and a switch by the major automobile manufacturers to cars that run on unleaded gas. Lead can cause damage to the brain and nervous system as well as to red blood cells and the digestive system. Children are especially at risk. The level of carbon monoxide in the air fell 25 percent between 1979 and 1988. The improvement, attributed to advances in emission-control technology, is particularly impressive in light of a 33 percent increase in vehicle miles traveled in that period.</p>
        <p>The level of particulate matter - small particles that have been linked to respiratory illness - decreased by 22 percent between 1979 and 1988. Particulate matter includes dust, dirt, soot and smoke from sources such as factories, power plants, car emissions and fires. Some of the decline occurred because of the installation of the pollution-control equipment required by the Clean Air Act; some is attributable to reduced activity in the iron and steel industries.</p>
        <p>Sulfur dioxide pollution dropped by about 30 percent between 1979 and 1988. The decrease reflected improved emission controls at new coal-powered electric generating plants and a reduction in the sulfur content of the coal used. Smelters and sulfuric-acid manufacturers have also improved emission controls since the passage of the act. Energy conservation and the use of cleaner fuels in residential and commercial buildings contributed to the reduction as well.</p>
        <p>The decline in ozone and nitrogen dioxide have been far less satisfactory. The number of days on which ozone levels exceeded the Federal standard fell 10 percent nationally and 4 percent in metropolitan areas between 1979 and 1988, although the number actually increased in several recent years. Levels of nitrogen dioxide fell 7 percent during the same period, but they are now inching up again.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. estimates that 133 million Americans now live in places that exceed the ozone standard on more than one day a year, and the number keeps rising. Los Angeles has by far the biggest problem - it exceeded the standard an average of 137.5 days a year between 1987 and 1989, compared with 44.2 days for Bakersfield, Calif., the second-highest area; 24.3 days for Fresno, Calif., the third-highest, and 17.4 days for the New York metropolitan area, the fourth-highest.</p>
        <p>Migrating ozone has meant problems even for isolated and once pristine areas. Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, tucked away from industry and freeways in the Sierra Nevada mountains of eastern California, recorded higher levels of ozone last year than many cities.</p>
        <p>In the summer of 1988, ozone levels were so high in Acadia National Park in Maine that park officials had to issue their first health alert.</p>
        <p>WHAT REMAINS TO BE done? What should the priorities be?</p>
        <p>One reason ozone pollution is so intractable is the diversity of its sources. A key component - fast-evaporating chemical mixtures called volatile-organic compounds - comes from automobile emissions, petroleum refineries and storage tanks, the manufacture of certain chemicals, dry cleaners and printing shops. Another key component - nitrogen oxide, which reacts with oxygen in the atmosphere to form the yellowish-brown gas nitrogen dioxide - comes mostly from the burning of fuel for transportation, utilities and industry. There are other explanations for the disappointing progress in reducing ozone levels, including the limitations of existing pollution-control technology and the increasing number of cars on the road. And in some sectors of the economy, such as chemical manufacturing, production is up enough to negate the gains made by cleaner production processes.</p>
        <p>For more progress to be made, many strategies will have to be used, including changing some production processes and finding substitutes for many industrial solvents and adhesives. But experts agree that the key to the ozone problem lies in the kinds of cars Americans drive and how much they use them. ''The biggest problem is still mobile sources,'' says James M. Lents, executive director of the South Coast Air Quality Management District, in Los Angeles. ''We've got to deal with it through much tighter auto emission standards, and we need markedly cleaner gasolines.''</p>
        <p>Other approaches for reducing the ozone pollution caused by cars have also been proposed, from retooling engines to investing in mass transit. But in the near future, the greatest progress can be made by reformulating gasoline so there is less evaporation of volatile organic compounds. In an attempt to stay ahead of the legislators, the major oil companies are already selling somewhat cleaner gasoline.</p>
        <p>Many technologies already exist to make cars burn fuel more efficiently and cleanly. Methanol-powered buses, for example, are being tested in California and Ohio. Clearly the most dramatic - and potentially most effective - step, at least for urban areas, is the electric car, which has long been on the drawing boards but now seems close to production for commercial use. Barry Commoner, director of the Center for the Biology of Natural Systems at Queens College in New York, sees the electric car as the answer because it produces no exhaust.</p>
        <p>Commoner and other proponents of electric cars argue that although they are less powerful than existing models, they are more than adequate for use in cities, where air pollution is most concentrated. Accordingly, he recommends that state and local governments use electric vehicles instead of gasoline-powered ones, which would encourage manufacturers to produce them.</p>
        <p>Daniel Berg, a professor of science and technology at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, estimates that if only 5 percent of the urban automobile fleet were replaced by electric vehicles by the turn of the century- a reasonable projection - the resulting improvement in air quality would be significant. What is more, the need for foreign oil would decline, a proposition that becomes even more attractive in light of the Middle East turmoil.</p>
        <p>Some changes in life styles must be made. Many experts say that Americans must simply drive less. They also say that all levels of government must make a commitment to mass transit. If that is done, it will not necessarily mean a sacrifice for commuters, says Deborah Sheiman, a resource specialist for the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington. 'If mass transit is improved, and people don't have to commute by car to work, we don't look at that as giving up something.''</p>
        <p>The state of California appears to be taking the lead. As a result of a recent referendum, more tha $18 billion raised by new taxes on gasoline will be channeled in part into expanding rail systems.</p>
        <p>The problem of the more than 300 airborne toxins for which emissions standards have not been set - like benzene and arsenic - must first be addressed by establishing such standards. Industries that emit these toxins should be required to adopt existing pollution-control technology, says Richard Ayres of the Natural Resources Defense Council.</p>
        <p>Some industries have shown great reluctance to add pollution controls on the grounds that the E.P.A. has not clearly established the levels of various pollutants that pose significant health risks. They also argue that complying with new Government standards may not be in their economic self-interest.</p>
        <p>But a number of larger corporations think that, in the long run, environmentally sound practices are not inconsistent with profitability. The 3M Company, for example, estimates that it has saved more than $500 million over the past 14 years through innovative antipollution strategies.</p>
        <p>In some cases, compliance with Government standards will make products more expensive. For example, Tom Graves, an attorney for the National Paint and Coatings Association, estimates that creating environmentally safer paints will cost the industry $200 million. But he says that if these costs are passed on incrementally to consumers, the increase will not be that noticeable.</p>
        <p>''I don't think there has to be a lot of sacrifice to the consumer,'' says Dan Greenbaum, commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection. ''A lot of things are going to cost the same or only slightly more if we do it on a nationwide basis.'' The point, in short, is that the air-pollution problem is still there, still serious, but still solvable once a consensus is reached that cleaning it up is a good idea.</p>
        <p>Sources of Smog</p>
        <p>SMOG IS A COMPLEX BREW OF pollutants. Chief among them are volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), particulates and ozone.</p>
        <p>Motor vehicles, industrial plants, electric utilities and wood-burning stoves are among the most obvious of polluters. Other sources of pollution are less widely known but no less serious. For example, organic vapors given off by paints, dry-cleaning chemicals, starter fluid used to ignite charcoal and even the fermentation process used in bakeries contribute to the formation of smog.</p>
        <p>Sensible Exercise</p>
        <p>On days when ozone levels are high, exercise can do more harm than good - unless you take precautions. In some states Government agencies have hotlines that provide ozone reports; you can also consult weather or pollution forecasts. When ozone is in the ''hazardous'' or ''very unhealthful'' range, all people should avoid strenuous outdoor activity. For children and people with respiratory problems, this restriction also applies on ''unhealthful'' days; others, on these days, should exercise early in the morning or late in the evening, the times when ozone levels are lowest, or indoors, where there is much less of the irritating gas.</p>
        <p>Medical Effects</p>
        <p>HEALTHY PEOPLE: Ozone can impair the oxygen-absorbing ability of the lungs. Chronic exposure to the gas can cause lesions similar to the early stages of lung damage from smoking. And particulates can make the respiratory tract susceptible to infection.</p>
        <p>ASTHMATICS: A smoggy day can be pure misery, since sulfur oxides and ozone can bring on wheezing and labored breathing.</p>
        <p>THE ELDERLY: High levels of sulfur oxides have been associated with increases in mortality among older people with respiratory disease.</p>
        <p>HEART PATIENTS: Carbon monoxide is a particular problem because it reduces the amount of oxygen the heart receives.</p>
        <p>Newly Charted Patterns of Ozone Smog</p>
        <p>OZONE IS THE MOST widespread air pollution problem. Unlike the natural ozone gas in the upper atmosphere, which shields the earth from damaging ultraviolet rays, the ozone gas at ground level is a health hazard, particularly to outdoor exercisers and people with respiratory conditions.</p>
        <p>Ozone forms when nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds, two other gaseous pollutants, react under the influence of sunlight. Nitrogen oxides are released by motor vehicles and industrial plants; volatile organics come from such diverse sources as backyard barbecues and dry cleaners. Areas with the highest levels of these gases, as shown above, also have high ozone levels.</p>
        <p>Many urban areas, including the cities shown on the map, frequently exceed the Federal ozone standard. But because ozone can be carried hundreds of miles by the wind, so do rural areas and even pristine wildernesses. In fact, some national parks exceed the ozone standard more often than some cities.</p>
