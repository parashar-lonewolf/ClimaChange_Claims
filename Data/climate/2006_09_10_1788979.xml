        <p>LOOKING for Mr. Right? How about Mr. Wright?</p>
        <p>A lot of women -- and men -- are finding him, along with his teammates, irresistible.</p>
        <p>David Wright, 23, the power-hitting third baseman of the Mets, is one reason an expanding group of local baseball fans are counting down to the postseason.</p>
        <p>''He's my age, and he's hot, and he's good,'' said Meghan Dockery, 23, a stockbroker.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dockery is a longtime Mets fan (and single), but there are many New Yorkers not baseball-obsessed who are being drawn toward the team from Queens, even though both the Mets and the Yankees (who call the Bronx home) are enjoying successful seasons.</p>
        <p>Andrew Mayer, 50, a stockbroker who lives in Brooklyn Heights, said he favored the Yankees over the Mets when the two teams squared off in the 2000 World Series, but if the rivals meet in another Subway Series in October, he'll be pulling for the team on the No. 7 line.</p>
        <p>''The Yankees have kind of sold themselves to Satan and brought in bad-feeling people like Randy Johnson and Giambi,'' Mr. Mayer said, referring to the surly 6-foot-10 pitcher and the first baseman Jason Giambi, who was implicated in a steroids scandal. ''The Mets have now become a more feel-good team.''</p>
        <p>The two franchises have been fighting for the heart of the city since 1962, when the Mets played their first regular-season game and soon became the laughingstock of the sports pages. The Mets, with their hungry teams and improbable victories, have buoyed and won over the city occasionally -- most famously in 1969, and more recently in the late 1980's, a rough time for the Yankees. But for the most part, the 103-year-old Yankees, with their law-firm haircuts, subtle pinstripes and 26 World Series championships, have been New York's home team. In the last 10 years, even as the Mets were experiencing a few good seasons, the Yankees were becoming dynastic.</p>
        <p>Now there are signs that the tide might be turning.</p>
        <p>A Quinnipiac University poll in 1998 showed that in a Subway Series, 60 percent of the city would root for the Yankees and 28 percent for the Mets. A similar poll in July showed that the number of Yankees rooters were down to 46 percent while the Mets numbers were up to 37 percent.</p>
        <p>Although the Mets trail the Yankees in attendance, perhaps a more telling measure of the Mets' new-found emotional appeal -- merchandise sales -- is now in a dead heat.</p>
        <p>For the first time in eight years, Derek Jeter T-shirts are not the most popular in the New York, New Jersey, Connecticut region, said Rich Yonkers, the vice president for signature license apparel at Modell's Sporting Goods. Mr. Wright's are, including one bearing the words ''Mrs. Wright.'' The chain has introduced a ''Wrighteous'' shirt, intended for a 12- t0 18-year-old male market and already a strong seller. And a line of ''Mrs. Wright'' love pendants is almost sold out at the souvenir stands in Shea Stadium.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yonkers said that for the last decade, Yankees garb has outsold anything bearing a Mets logo at Modell's by 80 percent to 20 percent, but this year the balance has fluctuated weekly, from even to 60-40 Mets. ''They're young, they're fresh, and they're exciting,'' he said of the National League team. ''The kids today, they don't want the same old.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Yonkers didn't need to be explicit, but ''same old'' could easily describe the Yankees' roster of established stars, whose predictable feats of power and elegance have made them a little less magical.</p>
        <p>''The Yankees have been dominant for so long -- since 1996 -- it's a little ho-hum with them,'' said Chris Russo, a host of the ''Mike and the Mad Dog'' radio show on WFAN. ''This year, there's more spark with the Mets. There's more personality there. It does feel like the city is rooting for the underdog to pull through.''</p>
        <p>Predominantly young, and collectively earning about half what the Yankees do (a payroll of about $100 million compared with almost $200 million for the American League team), the Mets are new and exciting to their fans. ''I'm pretty psyched that Beltrán is doing so great,'' said Lindsay Goldwert, 28, an associate producer at Court TV. ''He's dreamy.'' Even though the center fielder Carlos Beltrán was a legitimate star in the baseball world before he came to the Mets in 2005, Ms. Goldwert discovered him only as a Met, a team she grew up with but had lost interest in until this summer.</p>
        <p>Although the Mets -- and every other team -- claim they bring in players based only on talent and not ethnic origin, they do have a diversity that helps make them marketable in New York.</p>
        <p>The young, popular shortstop José Reyes, who recently signed a contract extension, is from the Dominican Republic. Mr. Beltrán, 29, is Puerto Rican. And, in an already extensively discussed move in August, the Mets acquired the outfielder Shawn Green, who might be the best Jewish player in the majors.</p>
        <p>Standing at his locker last week before a doubleheader in which he hit two home runs, Mr. Green said diversity helps attract fans, but not as much as winning does. ''When you've got a team winning and a wide variety of ethnic players, it allows more people to embrace the team,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have their share of diversity, including the Japanese star Hideki Matsui and exciting young players like the second baseman Robinson Canó and the outfielder Melky Cabrera. And there is no doubt the Yankees are more popular internationally than the Mets. GQ magazine's Taiwan version is arranging a profile on the pitcher Chien-Ming Wang.</p>
        <p>But world domination isn't the way to every fan's heart. Mike Fennema, 34, a native of the Netherlands who moved to New York in 2003, said he became a Mets fan because he was tired of seeing so many Yankees hats in Europe and Asia. ''I have a predilection for choosing the underdog,'' Mr. Fennema said.</p>
        <p>The Mets have long benefited from this mind-set, said Peter Golenbock a lifelong Yankees fan and the author of best-selling books about baseball in New York. The Mets ''often disappoint their fans, but the fans don't love the team any less,'' he said, adding that though Mets fans tend to be happier with their players than the notoriously critical Yankees fans, ''they are certainly happier when they have a 10-game lead.''</p>
        <p>A large part of the Mets' recent success with fans is their record of 87-52, the best in the major leagues as of Friday, and their position in the standings -- they lead the N.L. East by 16 1/2 games. But some of it is also the result of a concerted public relations strategy on the team's part, which has included, among other things, taking better advantage of their celebrity fans.</p>
        <p>Sandra van Meek, the director of market development (a job created this year), has a file of clips from celebrity magazines showing notables like Deborah Messing and Rhianna in Mets caps. John Stewart, the host of the ''The Daily Show'' and a long-time Mets fan, is among those who recorded Mets radio ads free.</p>
        <p>In light of the Yankees' success with the YES Network, which broadcasts Yankees games and general hagiography, the Mets started their own cable network, SportsNet New York, this year. Last year, when most Mets games were carried on two cable channels, the games attracted an average of about 110,000 households. This year, on SNY, 215,000 households tune in. (While the Yankees continue to wallop the Mets in television ratings, drawing an average of about 318,000 households, for their games on YES, the Bronx Bombers are down slightly compared with last year, when they averaged about 324,000 households.)</p>
        <p>For the Yankees' part, Lonn A. Trost, the team's chief operating officer, sought to avoid portraying the New York baseball scene as a competition. ''I am focused on the Yankees,'' he said. ''I am not looking to measure if Derek Jeter's T-shirt outsells Marv Throneberry's.''</p>
        <p>But the fact that Mr. Trost invoked the name of Mr. Throneberry, who first played for the Yankees and later became known as Marvelous Marv -- the emblem of the Mets' bumbling in the 1960's -- rather than Mr. Wright or Mr. Beltrán suggests the Mets are very much on the minds of the Yankees.</p>
        <p>While the Yankees still get more viewers on their network and sell more tickets (at a cost of about 10 percent more than tickets at Shea) to their games, baseball watchers think a Subway Series victory by the Mets might turn the tables. In 1986, the Mets' last World Series championship season, the team of Darryl Strawberry and Dwight Gooden drew 2,762,417 fans to Shea compared with the Yankees of Don Mattingly and Dave Winfield, who finished second in the A.L. East and drew 2,268,116.</p>
        <p>''The Mets' whole thing has been being the amazing team, the upset team,'' said Kevin Baker, a novelist (and Yankees fan) who is writing a book on the history of New York City baseball. ''If the Mets were to win a Subway Series, it might swing things back over to them. This is still pretty much a Yankees town, but the Mets are certainly making enormous headway.''</p>
        <p>While casual fans waver with their allegiances each season, the hardliners -- those Yankees fans who would sooner root for global warming than for the Mets, and the hard-core Mets fans who consider the Yankees only slightly less evil than Enron -- will not budge from their positions, no matter how well-reasoned the argument for supporting the other team might be.</p>
        <p>''I hate the Mets,'' said Gary Bradley, 42, who was standing near the bobblehead dolls at a Yankees Clubhouse Shop on West 42nd Street last week.</p>
        <p>Why?</p>
        <p>''Because they're the Mets.</p>
