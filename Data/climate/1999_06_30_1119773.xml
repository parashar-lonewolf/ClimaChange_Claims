        <p>New York City will be hit hard by the effects of global warming over the next century, as the sea level rises and washes away beaches, floods the subways and creates new wetland areas in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island, an environmental group said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The group, the Environmental Defense Fund, working in collaboration with Columbia University researchers, released a report yesterday called ''Hot Nights in the City,'' on what it considers the likely effects of the widely forecast rise in global temperatures.</p>
        <p>The report repeats calls for measures like cutting the emissions of carbon dioxide and other ''greenhouse gases,'' which trap heat in the atmosphere. It also suggests steps the city could take to adapt to the change in climate, like building sea walls and pulling back from shorefront development.</p>
        <p>By 2100, the report says, New York will have almost as many 90-degree days as Miami does now, with a year-round temperature increase of about 6 degrees. The rise in global temperatures will cause glaciers to melt, at least partly, and the sea level to rise, and could also cause droughts, threatening the city's upstate water supply.</p>
        <p>''If action isn't taken, the forecast for the future here is not good,'' said Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, the Environmental Defense Fund's chief scientist. ''Our children and grandchildren could be faced with 90 degree-plus days nearly all summer long.''</p>
        <p>The danger comes when a storm hits and flooding results, and such events are predicted to increase. Storms as powerful as the Northeaster of 1992 now happen every 18 years, but by 2050 they are expected to occur every 8 years, the report said. The 1992 storm shut down all 25 city subway lines, Franklin Delano Roosevelt Drive and La Guardia Airport. ''Basically, there was a complete shutdown of the transportation infrastructure of the city for a full day,'' Dr. Oppenheimer said.</p>
        <p>He added that it would be irresponsible to ''minimize the aspects of the changes that are going to occur.''</p>
        <p>Rae Zimmerman, director of the Institute for Civil Infrastructure Systems at New York University's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School for Public Service, who reviewed the study, said there were a number of steps the city could take.</p>
        <p>Ms. Zimmerman said new highways and buildings could be built to rise above the anticipated higher flood waters, and pipes could be installed in new and existing buildings to pump water out of higher floors. She added that more powerful pumps could be installed in subway tunnels to handle an increased volume of flood waters.</p>
        <p>Specifically, the report warned against the construction of an artificial dune on the seaward side of Fire Island, saying the appearance of stability would only encourage construction there. It also warned against building a huge shopping center development proposed for the Hackensack Meadowlands, a wetland area. Building there would eliminate the natural flood protection that wetlands provide.</p>
        <p>The report's methodology essentially involved plugging local geographic and climatic conditions into global computer models of atmospheric change. New York was chosen, he said, because the scenarios might help motivate influential movers and shakers in the financial and media worlds to press policy makers to address curbing greenhouse gases. An earlier report released by the fund sketched horror stories for Washington: the Jefferson Memorial would become an island, and muddy waters could reach the grounds of the Capitol.</p>
        <p>From a scientific perspective, computer simulations of the global climate are considered inexact at best. ''Predicting regional climate variations 100 years out is not something any scientist would say we are able to do,'' said Dr. John Christy, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Alabama in Huntsville.</p>
        <p>The professor, who has worked extensively with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to study satellite-gathered data, said people mistakenly considered the climate to which they were accustomed the normal one.</p>
        <p>''I get the feeling people think they have the right to a particular climate,'' Dr. Christy said. ''The system doesn't let you have that.''</p>
        <p>But Dr. Christy conceded that there was no doubt the world was getting gradually warmer, causing a rise in sea level of about a centimeter a decade over the last century.</p>
        <p>The Environmental Defense Fund report, along with most mainstream scientists, forecasts a much steeper global increase, predicting that sea levels in the New York Metropolitan region will rise by up to three and a half feet by 2100. Dr. Oppenheimer said this sea change would be steeper still in the city because land here is generally sinking a bit each year, even as the water level rises.</p>
