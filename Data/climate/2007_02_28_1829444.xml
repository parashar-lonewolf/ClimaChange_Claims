        <p>People who worry about global warming and want the United States to do more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions received some very good news over the weekend from a very unlikely source. As part of an ambitious buyout deal, TXU, a Texas utility that has long been a target of environmentalists, will abandon plans to build eight old-style coal-burning power plants, which would have dumped huge amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>The buyers -- two private equity companies, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Texas Pacific Group -- also agreed to invest $400 million to help their customers use energy more efficiently, and to explore cleaner ways to burn coal. In a gesture of potentially broad political consequence, they pledged to join other forward-looking companies in backing federal legislation imposing mandatory limits on emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas.</p>
        <p>The deal represents a shrewd reading of the political waters by the new owners. TXU had come under heavy fire from influential members of Congress, the courts and even the local citizenry. The companies also knew that plants using older technologies and producing heavy emissions could be severely penalized if Congress ever chose to regulate carbon dioxide. It also helped that Texas Pacific's co-founder, David Bonderman, is himself an ardent environmentalist who was willing to reach out to TXU's opponents, including influential environmental groups, for their help in negotiating a deal.</p>
        <p>Though the deal could be trumped by another offer, it is already being hailed as a pivotal moment in the fight against global warming. We shall see. It is certainly further evidence that the capital markets are becoming increasingly sensitive to the climate change issue. But the country and the environment cannot depend on good sense or even good business sense to persuade other corporate leaders to follow Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Texas Pacific. Congress needs to move briskly toward legislation that would put a price on carbon, either by taxing it or capping emissions.</p>
        <p>The Energy Department says there are 159 new coal-fired power plants on the drawing boards; of these, only 32 are considering -- though not committed to -- technologies that could significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions. What's needed is federal legislation that would drive them in the direction TXU's new owners have promised to take.</p>
