        <p>THE sun was shining, though by no means with all its might. Beaming across the surrounding snow-capped peaks, it emitted a moody, fractured light. Which in this case wasn't odd, even though it would soon be the middle of the night.</p>
        <p>I was on the Alyeska Glacier, atop Mount Alyeska, 40 miles southeast of Anchorage. It was intermittently raining, which Matt Szundy, the leader of my four-person climbing team, assured us was typical for June in this part of Alaska. ''It is a rain-forest climate, after all,'' he said. Sure enough, below the white of the snow line, lush moss and trees covered the mountainous slopes in a dense green carpet.</p>
        <p>We had already hiked to 3,200 feet on a snowy, icy trek up Mount Alyeska, high above the aptly named Glacier Valley. On a less misty day, seven glaciers would have been visible from our vantage point; so far we could see only bits and pieces of them as the clouds moved in and out, bringing hazy sun one minute and cool drizzle the next. But the occasional rain and the accompanying chill were forgotten a few minutes later when we arrived at a safe spot on a moraine at the top of the glacier and turned around to look behind us.</p>
        <p>The clouds chose the right moment to clear, revealing the scene we had come to see: the snow-veined slopes of the western Chugach Mountains lit by sun and framed by mist, at an hour to midnight. The waters of Turnagain Arm, a fjord that branches from Cook Inlet, glistened below. We dropped our ropes and trekking poles and silently drank in the view.</p>
        <p>Sunshine at 11 p.m. can produce a confused feeling similar to jet lag. But this is a disorientation that fills people with energy, not lassitude -- a yen for activity at all hours. And what better time than around midnight to enjoy the Alaskan alpenglow?</p>
        <p>Alaska in summer is the Land of Everything Midnight Sun, from microbrews to marathons. Most uses of the phrase are lighthearted marketing gimmicks dreamed up to draw visitors to the state during the long daylight season. But the midnight sun glacier hikes like the one I experienced, guided by the Ascending Path climbing service based in the town of Girdwood, actually take hikers out into the wild during the late-night light. Locals may be used to the all-day glow, but for visitors the experience is magical. Low in the sky, the sun lights up the Chugach Mountain landscape, and even after it dips below the mountains, an intense, prolonged twilight continues to glint off the snow and ice, gleaming softly across the flats of Turnagain Arm to the Alaska Range on the other side. From the top of Mount Alyeska, if the timing is right, it's possible to see a surging wall of water called the bore tide rolling across the fjord. It's also possible to get a sunburn while hiking at 9 p.m.</p>
        <p>These hikes also promise more: a chance to learn a serious thing or two about Alaska's singular, signature landscape and to see one of the planet's clearest manifestations of climate change. Glaciers are where the change is most obvious, and according to scientists at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, Alaska has lost 500 cubic miles of ice from its glaciers in the last 50 years. The melting of Alaska's glaciers currently accounts for about half the annual loss of glacial ice worldwide. Matt and Heather Szundy, co-owners of Ascending Path, worked in Antarctica during the Southern Hemisphere summers from 2002 through 2005, assisting in projects sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the United States Antarctic Program. Scientists there were using glaciers as models of climate change.</p>
        <p>''We always tell stories about our own experiences,'' Mrs. Szundy, 29, said -- she was assistant manager of a science lab in Antarctica and Mr. Szundy, now 32, did field safety work. ''And anyone who works on glaciers will tell you that the glaciers have been receding for many years.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Szundy came up with the idea of midnight sun glacier hikes three years ago. The Szundys had just started their guided climbing service on Alyeska Glacier, in partnership with the popular Alyeska ski resort. She thought the solstice would be an appealing time for novices to learn some basics of mountaineering, glaciology and the changing environment. The resort's tram takes the hikers up to 2,300 feet, where they begin the 50-minute climb up to the edge of the glacier. Once there, they put on climbing harnesses and tie into rope teams for safety. Depending on ice and snow conditions, hikers may also wear crampons or overboots for traction.</p>
        <p>In the easier sections of the four-hour midnight sun glacier hike I took in June, Mrs. Szundy talked about life forms on the mountain. ''People don't think of glaciers as being places of life,'' she said, ''but a lot of other organisms in the area depend on their health.''</p>
        <p>She stopped to examine -- and sample -- clusters of bearberries and crowberries hidden under the snow. Bears depend on them for sustenance until the snow melts and the eating is better. The bears find the berries by pawing at snow and seeing if it turns red. How were the berries? ''Eh -- not so good right now,'' Mrs. Szundy said, spitting them out. No one else in our group ventured a taste.</p>
        <p>She also pointed out ''watermelon snow,'' a ubiquitous pink-tinted snow layer that is so nicknamed for its whiff of watermelon; both the scent and the rosy color come from algae that grow in the snow when summer begins. ''It smells nice, but don't eat it,'' she warned. ''It will give you what is known in polite terms as gastrointestinal distress.'' Her advice: Leave it to the glacier worms that actually do survive on the algae.</p>
        <p>When we reached the edge of the glacier, we separated into two groups tied in by harness to climbing ropes, so that each team could stop if someone fell into a crevasse hidden under the snow. (Mr. Szundy, the leader of my team, reassured us that it's usually the first person in the chain who falls in.) My life was entrusted in part to the man hiking 15 feet in front of me, Patrick Hyde, 34, from San Francisco. Neither of us had hiked on a glacier before.</p>
        <p>But we were both awed by the midsummer-night views. ''You don't get light like this anywhere else,'' Mr. Hyde said. The promise of that light, he added, was the reason he chose the solstice time for his first trip to Alaska.</p>
        <p>Alyeska Glacier is at its most picturesque in late July and early August, when all the snow is gone, its various ice structures are visible, and the surrounding wildflowers are in full bloom.</p>
        <p>''A helicopter will get you on a better glacier, but this is really accessible, and a chance to get lots of different people involved in understanding nature and how to respect the earth,'' Mr. Szundy said. ''Our motto is: 'We're in the system to change the system.' ''</p>
        <p>Alyeska Glacier, about a square mile, has receded more than 160 feet in the three seasons that the Szundys have been working on it. Other famous Alaskan glaciers have also shrunk in striking fashion: in the last decade, Portage Glacier, which is about 15 miles south of Girdwood, has receded out of sight of its own visitor center.</p>
        <p>''Glaciers are a diary of climate change, but written in a language that is a bit complicated for the average person to understand,'' said David Hawkins, head of the climate program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a national nonprofit environmental action group. ''So it is great that these guides are using the tours to bring an understanding to the people who visit.''</p>
        <p>Eighty percent of Ascending Path's guests are from out of state, mostly families and active couples and friends who are looking for adventure, knowledge and a midnight sun experience. Because Ascending Path hikes never have more than five guests per guide, the Szundys can tailor trips to their customers' climbing experience.</p>
        <p>''This year, we expect a little over a million and a half visitors to Alaska,'' said Dave Worrell, a spokesman for the Alaska Travel Industry Association. ''People come to Alaska to see mountains, glaciers and wildlife. And quite a few will take the opportunity to visit a glacier up close.''</p>
        <p>Charlene Penna, 41, of Hermosa Beach, Calif., took a midnight sun glacier hike while in Alaska with two friends, Debbie Chavez and Dolly Hsia, to run in the Mayor's Midnight Sun Marathon on June 17 in Anchorage.</p>
        <p>''We didn't have a lot of time and wanted to squeeze a lot in,'' said Ms. Penna, a chief financial officer for an entertainment company.</p>
        <p>''The mile-long climb uphill in the snow was tough, because our legs were spent from the race,'' Ms. Penna said. ''But every time we got up to a ridge, the view was worth it. And when we got to the top, we hung out for a while, learning about all the different glaciers up there. The sun was so bright, I couldn't believe it. And the waters of Turnagain Arm looked different every time I looked out there.''</p>
