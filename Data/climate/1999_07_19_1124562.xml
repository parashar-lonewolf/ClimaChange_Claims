        <p>Water shortage is far from anyone's mind on the banks of the mighty Rhone River as it surges from the high glaciers of Switzerland down through eastern France. Along its 500-mile route, it is fed by many tributaries until the river spills, largely untapped, into the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
        <p>But along the same sea, scarcity of fresh water is an increasingly nagging issue farther west, in the arid regions of eastern Spain. Planners predict that in the area around Barcelona, Spain's second-largest city and the main seat of industry, the shortage of drinking water may become severe.</p>
        <p>So Barcelona has developed a daring plan: to build a pipeline through southern France and the Pyrenees to carry water from the Rhone River to Spain. The 200-mile aqueduct could provide water for more than 4.5 million people, who would pay for the project with higher water bills. Although the plan is still far from approved, it is the first time a pipeline of this scale to carry water from one country to another is being seriously considered in Europe.</p>
        <p>Experts point to the scheme as a foreshadowing of things to come along the Mediterranean, where the climate is turning measurably drier and warmer.</p>
        <p>Along Europe's southern shores, from Greece to the tip of Portugal, agricultural lands of old are being reclassified as arid. The population,  keeps rising, encouraged by tourism, while water supplies dwindle. Because of the dryness, forest fires and water rationing are becoming ever more common.</p>
        <p>In rich Europe, which can pay for water, the Barcelona scheme is one option. But there are others. Italy has been considering delivering water to its parched south by building a pipeline under the Adriatic Sea to pump in supplies from Albania. The Spanish island of Majorca has drawn up plans to build underwater pipes to the mainland because during the summers, extra drinking water has to be brought in by tanker.</p>
        <p>Until now, policymakers have spent ample funds to figure out the reasons for the droughts and the subsequent erosion and loss of arable land. Many studies have revolved around the question: Is the Mediterranean climate becoming drier because of global warming? But as water shortages loom larger, planners are focusing more on solutions.</p>
        <p>Barcelona's water agency asked a French panel two years ago to study the viability of a great aqueduct bringing water from the Rhone. The panel of hydrologists, lawyers and environmentalists published their conclusions last month, saying an aqueduct would have only a ''negligible'' effect on the enormous volume of the Rhone.</p>
        <p>Michel Desbordes, a professor of hydrology at Montpellier University, chairman of the panel, said the Rhone stood apart from the other main waterways flowing into the Mediterranean. ''It is the most robust of the big rivers and also the least utilized,'' he said. ''In fact it's the last great source of untapped fresh water in the Mediterranean Basin.''</p>
        <p>He said that only 1 percent of the river water is used and the rest spills into the sea. The Nile, he said, which has a similar great volume of water, looses close to 95 percent along the way, mostly to agriculture. About half the flow of the Po River in Italy and the Ebro River in Spain are  siphoned off, he said.</p>
        <p>''The Rhone is also remarkably clean,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The pipeline to Barcelona would tap about 1 percent of the Rhone's normal volume. The pipe, eight feet in diameter, would start above Montpellier, reach the Camargue delta, run along the French coast and pierce the rocks of the Pyrenees. The cost has been estimated at $1 billion, depending on whether the pipeline will also be used to provide water to  French towns along the way, such as Beziers, Carcassonne and Narbonne, which occasionally have water problems. The report estimates that the construction cost can be earned back in 25 years.</p>
        <p>For Barcelona water users, this might mean domestic water prices  three to four times today's prices. The Barcelona water agency points out that higher charges would reduce waste and lead to the repair of leaks.</p>
        <p>If this plan fails, Barcelona will have to build an aqueduct to the Ebro River, which, while closer, would cost 10 percent more because of difficult terrain. The level of the Ebro can drop dramatically and its water rights have often been the subject of intense political fights.</p>
        <p>Planners say they believe that negotiating the water rights for the new aqueduct may serve as a model for other European projects. ''Building the pipeline is technically easy because it will run through the Languedoc Plain,'' said Jacques Labre, an official at Suez-Lyonnaise des Eaux, one of the companies involved in the plan. But among the hurdles, he said, are legal and political intricacies and, not least, French farmers.</p>
        <p>France's farmers, a powerful group, have regularly staged protests against their Spanish colleagues, put up roadblocks and destroyed Spanish produce, which they see as undercutting French prices.</p>
        <p>To send French water to Spain, even water that otherwise would be spilled into the sea, may be seen on the Gallic farms as aiding and abetting the competition. And this, some experts fear, is something that may not wash easily.</p>
