        <p>The Pentagon today suspended the transfer of Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to its naval base in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.</p>
        <p>Officials said flights were suspended because the base had run out of space, for the time being. Washington is facing sharp criticism from its closest allies over its treatment of the prisoners, and officials said they did not want to overcrowd the stockade.</p>
        <p>The United States also began to question prisoners today for the first time since they started arriving at Guantánamo two weeks ago, officials said, though some had been interrogated in Afghanistan. The sessions today were held in a tent by several United States agencies, officials said. No foreign governments are taking part at this time, nor do the prisoners have lawyers.</p>
        <p>The compound is holding 158 prisoners and has 160 cages built of chain-link fencing. The military intends to construct 320 more temporary cages and then move all prisoners into cells with solid walls. Total capacity is planned for 1,000.</p>
        <p>Maj. Stephen A. Cox of the Marines said in an interview from Guantánamo that the flights of prisoners were being halted only temporarily.</p>
        <p>''Rather than put ourselves in the position of bringing them out here and doubling them up in two per unit, which is not good from a detainee perspective or from a security perspective, we said, 'Let's hold on for a second,' '' he said. ''But we will resume the flow soon.''</p>
        <p>Another military official in Washington said, ''They don't necessarily want to put more people in those cells now,'' referring to the 8-foot by 8-foot cages. ''They don't want it to be perceived that we're jamming them in there.''</p>
        <p>The United States' treatment of the prisoners has drawn especially blunt criticism from Europe, where it has raised fears that Washington may be applying international law selectively.</p>
        <p>The decision by the Pentagon to keep the detainees outside the United States and not to classify them as prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions has troubled European and other allies. The United States may be ''making up the rules as it goes along,'' said a West European ambassador here.</p>
        <p>''This is international law à la carte, like multilateralism à la carte,'' the ambassador said. ''It annoys your allies in the war against terrorism and it creates problems for our Muslim allies, too. It puts at stake the moral credibility of the war against terrorism.''</p>
        <p>In the last few days, the German and Dutch governments and the European Union have openly criticized the treatment of the captives. They were spurred by a Pentagon photograph of bound, shackled prisoners, their heads and eyes covered, kneeling before American soldiers.</p>
        <p>Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer of Germany and the European Union director of security, Javier Solana, said the Geneva Conventions must be applied to the prisoners, which would mean the prisoners are not obliged to submit to interrogation.</p>
        <p>There has also been criticism of the physical treatment from the United Nations commissioner for human rights, Mary Robinson, and groups like Amnesty International and Doctors Without Borders.</p>
        <p>The photographs of shackled prisoners caused the British foreign secretary, Jack Straw, to protest to Washington more than a week ago, in the first open criticism of the Bush administration by the British since Sept. 11. He was reportedly reassured about the treatment of the prisoners, but was appalled by the damage that the issue could do to the coalition against terrorism.</p>
        <p>Mr. Straw's concerns proved prescient, as the cascade of criticism continued. The defense secretary, Donald H. Rumsfeld, was prompted to devote an hour-long news conference to the subject on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rumsfeld called the publication of the photos ''probably unfortunate.'' He insisted that the prisoners, who he said were extremely dangerous, were being held under humane conditions ''consistent with the Geneva Convention'' and had been visited by Red Cross representatives.</p>
        <p>Europeans saw the photographs as evidence that the United States was failing to protect the prisoners' fundamental rights against humiliation and psychological torture. But the Europeans' concerns went beyond specifics.</p>
        <p>''A lot of the European reaction to Guantánamo is not because people care about the feelings of the prisoners there,'' said Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform, a research group in London. ''It's touched a neuralgic point, which is the European concern that America doesn't believe in international law, doesn't believe in submitting itself to rules, organizations or norms that limit its freedom of action.''</p>
        <p>The Bush administration has withdrawn from the Kyoto treaty on the environment, for example, arguing that it will not solve the problem of greenhouse gases. Washington has also said it will not take part in an international criminal court set up by the United Nations because American officials and soldiers could be tried there.</p>
        <p>These trans-Atlantic arguments about international obligations were heated before Sept. 11, but became muted after. The war against terrorism has brought them forward in a new way, Mr. Grant said.</p>
        <p>European voters and governments are asking, ''How can we argue the case that the moral thing to do is to fight terrorism if we're not prepared to apply basic human rights and international law to the detainees?'' Mr. Grant said.</p>
        <p>That argument was echoed by Jacques Amalric in a commentary in the French newspaper Libération. ''The prisoners, already presumed guilty, have been denied the protection of the judicial guarantees afforded by the American institutional system,'' he wrote. ''Certainly nothing will be the same after Sept. 11, but should this be true of justice?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>''Beyond the issue of human rights,'' he warned, ''the credibility of the war against terrorism is at stake.''</p>
        <p>Today the Anglican bishop of Birmingham, England, the Right Rev. Mark Santer, said the British-American alliance against terrorism was risking its ''moral credibility in the eyes of the world'' and risked provoking further terrorism.</p>
        <p>''It is not edifying that the strongest country, America, has set itself up as prosecutor, judge, jury and executioner of its case,'' he said. ''The argument that the Taliban is appalling, therefore it doesn't matter how we treat them, is degrading to our own claim to be upholding the standards of civilization.''</p>
        <p>For their part, British politicians reacted angrily to Secretary Rumsfeld's attack on them for criticizing Guantánamo from ''a comfortable distance.''</p>
        <p>''We've supported the United States,'' said Ann Clwyd, a legislator from the ruling Labor Party. ''It seems rather crass to dismiss legitimate concerns out of hand. We don't want to be insulted by Donald Rumsfeld.''</p>
        <p>America's reputation for generosity is at stake, said Vittorio Zucconi, in a comment in the Italian daily Corriere della Sera. ''It is from the way these men will be treated, from the justice they will receive, that America, and we as allies, will find out if the military and technological superiority showed in the battle field can turn into juridical and moral superiority,'' he wrote.</p>
        <p>If Taliban prisoners return home, as America's German and Italian and Japanese prisoners did after World War II, with memories of humane and just treatment, he said, ''another phase of this war against terror will be achieved.''</p>
