        <p>Editorial says for conservationists Pres Bush's first year in office has been big disappointment, yielding little more than few promises; says 'destructive synergies' have been at work within his administration (M)</p>

        <p>One of President Bush's assistants said recently that if the president chose to model himself on anyone, it would be Theodore Roosevelt. As regards environmental policy, surely an important component of Roosevelt's legacy, we fail to see the comparison. Roosevelt started the national wildlife refuge system. Mr. Bush sees the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as a source of oil. Roosevelt greatly expanded the national forests. Mr. Bush would shrink important protections for those forests.</p>
        <p>For conservationists, Mr. Bush's first year was a big disappointment, yielding little more than a few promises. It's possible that he may yet do good things for the national parks, despite his fixation on letting snowmobiles roam as free as the bison in Yellowstone. He has also promised full funding for the government's main land acquisition program, and promoted the redevelopment of contaminated industrial sites known as brownfields. On most major issues, however -- clean air, clean water, the protection of the public lands from commercial exploitation -- he has retreated or signaled retreat from the policies of his predecessor.</p>

        <p>One of President Bush's assistants said recently that if the president chose to model himself on anyone, it would be Theodore Roosevelt. As regards environmental policy, surely an important component of Roosevelt's legacy, we fail to see the comparison. Roosevelt started the national wildlife refuge system. Mr. Bush sees the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as a source of oil. Roosevelt greatly expanded the national forests. Mr. Bush would shrink important protections for those forests.</p>
        <p>For conservationists, Mr. Bush's first year was a big disappointment, yielding little more than a few promises. It's possible that he may yet do good things for the national parks, despite his fixation on letting snowmobiles roam as free as the bison in Yellowstone. He has also promised full funding for the government's main land acquisition program, and promoted the redevelopment of contaminated industrial sites known as brownfields. On most major issues, however -- clean air, clean water, the protection of the public lands from commercial exploitation -- he has retreated or signaled retreat from the policies of his predecessor.</p>
        <p>Unless Mr. Bush himself alters course, the prospects for improvement are zero. That is because he has filled nearly all the critical posts where policy is hatched and regulations written with people who regard the environment as a resource to be exploited and who have earned their keep representing logging, mining, oil, livestock and other interests. The one faint hope in this dreary landscape is Christie Whitman, the boss of the Environmental Protection Agency. But apart from a brave decision directing General Electric to clean up the Hudson River, Mrs. Whitman has essentially been running in place. A big victory for her is upholding a rule written in the Clinton administration.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the field is littered with broken promises. The biggest was Mr. Bush's abandonment on March 13 of his campaign promise to reduce industrial emissions of carbon dioxide. This decision foreshadowed his withdrawal two weeks later from the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, as well as the unveiling in May of his broader energy strategy, which favors precisely the same fossil fuels that are believed to cause the warming problem.</p>
        <p>There were less dramatic betrayals as well. At his confirmation hearings, for example, Attorney General John Ashcroft pledged to defend as the ''law of the land'' a landmark Clinton-era rule barring logging and other forms of commercial development in 58.5 million acres of roadless national forest. Mr. Ashcroft's lawyers have since done almost nothing to defend the rule against court challenges from industry, a failure that has encouraged the timber lobbyists who now run the Forest Service to proceed with their parallel campaign to destroy the roadless policy by administrative means. Mr. Ashcroft's negative handiwork is everywhere. Three days after Mrs. Whitman upheld a Clinton rule protecting wetlands, his lawyers opened settlement talks with developers seeking to weaken the rule. That, in turn, can only encourage the Army Corps of Engineers in its parallel efforts to undermine other aspects of wetlands law.</p>
        <p>Such are the destructive synergies at work in the Bush administration. The only person who can turn things around is Mr. Bush, so strong is the mindset of his retainers. Will he? At the moment, he is riding high, and issues like the environment do not loom large. Yet ever since the landmark conservation laws enacted three decades ago under another Republican, Richard Nixon, Americans have demonstrated a commitment to environmental values that transcends party. In times of conflict or economic crisis, this commitment recedes. But it always comes back, and politicians who ignore it pay dearly.</p>
