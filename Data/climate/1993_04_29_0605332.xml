        <p>Vice President Gore may know more about global warming than the President ("Mr. Clinton, Meet Mr. Gore," editorial, April 20), but the whole Administration should be aware of what is known. Few of the nations that voted for the 1990 limit on carbon dioxide emissions have the information base to report their 1990 emissions or monitor their progress. The United States does, and in our society of policy by court cases, if we had signed such a treaty the Government would be sued to actually comply with it.</p>

        <p>Vice President Gore may know more about global warming than the President ("Mr. Clinton, Meet Mr. Gore," editorial, April 20), but the whole Administration should be aware of what is known. Few of the nations that voted for the 1990 limit on carbon dioxide emissions have the information base to report their 1990 emissions or monitor their progress.

        <p>Mr. Gore's environmental platform sounded appealing to college audiences, but progress is in the details. The developing nations cannot even hope for economic development without a lot more energy, almost all from burning more coal, oil and gas. China and India will dominate global CO2 emissions a decade from now, regardless of what we do. But if we want to limit emissions, we can invest more in conservation and non-fossil fuel development, and then measure our progress.  A. DAVID ROSSIN  Los Altos Hills, Calif., April 20, 1993 The writer was Assistant Energy Secretary for Nuclear Energy in 1986-87.</p>
