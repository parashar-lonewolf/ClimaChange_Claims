        <p>Slip 'n' Slide Glaciers</p>
        <p>Whoever invented the Slip 'n' Slide knew a thing or two about friction -- namely that a child in a bathing suit will not get very far gliding on a 20-foot-long piece of plastic in the backyard unless there is a stream of water on it to provide lubrication.</p>
        <p>Glaciers and ice sheets do a lot of slipping and sliding as well, and here too, water plays an important role. Just how important is made clear by research from scientists at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and several other institutions.</p>
        <p>The researchers measured movement of a part of the ice sheet that covers most of Greenland, using Global Positioning System readings of the displacement of a pole stuck in the ice. They found that the movement accelerated significantly in summer, when a lot of surface ice melted.</p>
        <p>For example, the researchers found that in the summers of 1998 and 1999, the rate of movement increased by three to three-and-a-half inches per day above the average midwinter rate of 12 inches per day. In the low-melt summer of 1996, however, the rate increased by less than half an inch per day.</p>
        <p>The results, the researchers write in the journal Science, show that glacial sliding can be affected by the quick movement of water from the surface of the ice sheet to its bottom, probably through crevasses and vertical channels called moulins. Once it reaches the bottom (having traveled about 4,000 feet in the case of the Greenland sheet), the water provides lubrication between the ice and bedrock.</p>
        <p>Previously it had been thought that surface melting would affect movement only slowly, over hundreds of years, as ice thickness changed and altered the stresses at the bottom that help drive the sheet along. The researchers say their work suggests that the effect is much more rapid, and that ice movement could be rapidly increased by climate warming.</p>
        <p>Shaking Under Japan</p>
        <p>There is plenty of slipping and sliding going on under Japan, too -- the occasional earthquake, of course, but also much less powerful (and more constant) vibrations from deep underground. Many of these vibrations are caused by volcanoes, of which Japan has more than its share. But Japanese scientists recently discovered another, nonvolcanic, rumbling from the deep. And once again, water plays a role.</p>
        <p>The tremors were picked up by an array of 600 highly sensitive seismic stations set up by the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention as a kind of early warning system for earthquakes. The tremors are very weak, and could be picked up only by such an extensive and sensitive array.</p>
        <p>Researchers from the institute were able to locate the source of the tremors at a depth of about 25 miles under southwestern Japan, where the Philippine Sea plate is sinking beneath the Eurasian plate, a process known as subduction.</p>
        <p>Writing in Science, the researchers suggest that the tremors occur as the subducting slab of rock dries out. As the plate sinks, pressure and friction cause it to heat up, and lots of water is liberated from the minerals that make up the rock. This superheated water, in turn, can cause many small fractures in the rock, resulting in the tremors.</p>
        <p>Sauropod Solidarity</p>
        <p>British scientists have analyzed dinosaur footprints from a limestone quarry near Oxford and have discovered evidence that different species herded together, perhaps to avoid predators.</p>
        <p>In a report in Science, the scientists say that 40 close-together trackways -- trails of 163-million-year-old footprints -- are a sign that more than one species of plant-eating sauropod dinosaur may have traveled together to avoid meat-eating predators. The analysis is bolstered by the presence, not too far away, of the tracks of a carnivore who was heading in the same direction at about the same time.</p>
