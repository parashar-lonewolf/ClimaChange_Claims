        <p>LEAD: THE American black duck, whose numbers have shrunk by 60 percent in the last 30 years, may be on the road to extinction because males of the species are too timid to win females away from the flashier and more assertive mallard drake, a study by Canadian scientists suggests.</p>
        <p>THE American black duck, whose numbers have shrunk by 60 percent in the last 30 years, may be on the road to extinction because males of the species are too timid to win females away from the flashier and more assertive mallard drake, a study by Canadian scientists suggests.</p>
        <p>When challenged by mallard drakes at mating time, male black ducks ''don't fight, or they tend to give up real quick,'' says Dr. C. Davison Ankney of the University of Western Ontario, a zoologist who took part in the study. Not only does this prevent female black ducks from mating with their own species, the researchers say, but it probably also sends them a message: a mallard drake will be a better protector during the critical egg-laying period.</p>
        <p>So, in what seems to be a clear-cut instance of natural selection at work, mallard-black duck hybrids are increasingly replacing black ducks across a wide stretch of eastern North America where mallards, more and more, are moving into black-duck territory. And although black ducks are not yet an endangered or threatened species, they could ultimately disappear. Efforts to Protect Species</p>
        <p>The trend is continuing despite stringent hunting regulations that have reduced the kill of black ducks by 40 percent in the United States and 10 to 15 percent in Canada in about the last five years. So far, no other method of stopping the interbreeding problem has been tried.</p>
        <p>Other factors, too, have been implicated in the decline of the black duck. These include acid rain in the lakes frequented by the ducks and human encroachment on habitats. But interbreeding with mallards has been recognized as a major threat and the new study is the first to suggest what may be responsible.</p>
        <p>The study was conducted by Lynn M. Brodsky, a post-doctoral student at Western Ontario; Dr. Ankney, a senior faculty member there, and Darrell G. Dennis, a wildlife biologist with the Canadian Wildlife Service.</p>
        <p>In one phase of the study, ducks of both species were raised from hatchlings in four separate groups of 10 males and 10 females each: mallard males and females, black duck males and females, mallard males and black duck females, black duck males and mallard females.</p>
        <p>In their first mating season, the experiment began. Male ducks from both species were placed in alternating cubicles arranged inside a pen in shallow, marshy water. One at a time, females from each of the rearing groups were released into the pen. They were separated from the males by wire mesh. The object was to observe the behavior of each male and female toward the other.</p>
        <p>In every case, the researchers found that every male was more attentive to females of the species with which he had been raised. Similarly, every female quickly gravitated to the most active male of the species with which she had been raised, and stayed in front of his cubicle during the test period. The researchers concluded that early learning primarily influenced the choice of mate.</p>
        <p>But in the second half of the experiment, they found that this learning was overwhelmed and overridden when male mallards and male black ducks were allowed to compete for a female's attention. The researchers put males of both species in a test pen in the marsh water, containing no barriers or cubicles. In the middle of the pen was a wooden platform on which the birds could rest. Pecking Order Is Established</p>
        <p>At once, the male ducks began chasing and attacking each other and competing for dominance of the platform. Within 30 minutes, a firm pecking order was established. The highest-ranking male, who dominated the platform, was always a mallard, the lowest-ranking always a black duck.</p>
        <p>When a female of either species was introduced into the pen, she paired with the dominant male, always a mallard. Subordinate males distanced themselves both from the dominant male and the female.</p>
        <p>Why mallards dominate black ducks is not certain. One theory holds that the brighter, more colorful mallard male - with his green head, white neckband, dark chestnut breast, violet wing feathers and orange-red legs and feet - looks bigger than a similar-size black duck, with its dark-brown dullness. Another possibility is that to a male mallard, a male black duck looks like a female mallard, and therefore does not appear to be much of a threat in a fight. Caught in Genetic Decline</p>
        <p>In the wild, said Dr. Ankney, mallards mate with both species. So while pure mallards continue to be produced, the black duck is caught in a genetic decline: If a male mallard-black duck hybrid pairs with a female mallard, most of their offspring will look like mallards. If it mates with a female black duck, the offspring will display the hybrid's partially green head and neck ring that make it look something like a mallard, but darker.</p>
        <p>Either way, it appears that the black duck species is being absorbed by that of the mallard. Or re-absorbed. The two species are so genetically similar, Dr. Ankney said, that it is likely that black ducks began splitting off from the mallard line, probably in the last Ice Age, but ''never really made it as a species.''</p>
