        <p>A major earthquake registering 7.1 on the Richter scale struck off Honshu Island early today, Japanese officials said. Three coastal villages were ordered evacuated for fear of tidal waves.</p>
        <p>There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage from the quake, which struck at 3:26 A.M. It was centered about 60 miles off the coast and at a depth of 20 miles, the Central Meteorological Agency in Tokyo said.</p>
        <p>After the quake, officials closed the major expressway through the affected region for inspection and overnight trains were stopped to check the condition of the rails.</p>
        <p>The agency warned of a tsunami, or seismic tidal wave, hitting coastal towns on northeastern Honshu and the northernmost main island of Hokkaido. The agency said sea levels two hours after the quake had risen nearly three feet in the region.</p>
        <p>Officials ordered the evacuation of the villages of Taro, Sanriku and Ozutsu, about 300 miles northeast of Tokyo on Honshu's eastern coast.</p>
        <p>The agency said the quake had a magnitude of 7.1 on the Richter scale, the same as the Oct. 17 earthquake that devastated the San Francisco Bay area.</p>
