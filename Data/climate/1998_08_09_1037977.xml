        <p>Marco Liberali decided not to fiddle around while Rome burned. Seeking relief from Rome's tropical temperatures, the 41-year-old mechanic installed central air-conditioning in his family's apartment on the edge of the city.</p>
        <p>''What a difference it makes,'' Mr. Liberali said with the assuredness of the newly converted. ''Humid heat is bad for you.''</p>
        <p>When Americans rushed to cool their air, Europeans traditionally just slowed down and endured the summer heat. But now people like Mr. Liberali, who got to know air-conditioning at the hotel where he works, have decided to stop going without.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Europe is becoming a big market for the air-conditioning industry. Sales of air-conditioners for homes and small businesses have grown more than 20 percent over the last three years, even as they stayed flat in the United States, and the growth shows no sign of abating.</p>
        <p>In Europe, sales of air-conditioners for homes and small businesses, including central air units for homes, are expected to reach $3.2 billion this year, from $2.5 billion in 1996. In the United States, they are expected only to inch up to $7.74 billion, from $7.73 billion in 1996.</p>
        <p>Credit some of the growth to the pressures of a global economy, which are increasingly forcing Europeans to work summers. Air pollution is also bolstering the demand for air-conditioning, and Europeans are becoming more accustomed to it in offices and their cars, and increasingly want it in their homes.</p>
        <p>But environmentalists are concerned. Air-conditioners consume a significant amount of energy, and their emissions help deplete the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>To be sure, many hurdles must fall before Europe can fully indulge its new fondness for the big chill. Both electricity and air-conditioners are costly, many homes lack proper wiring, home power supplies are often weak and many Europeans view air-conditioning as unhealthy: there is simply a bias to rely on nature.</p>
        <p>Still, the trend toward a cooler Europe is clear.</p>
        <p>''Above all in the whole area of small businesses and homes, the use of air-conditioning is increasing,'' said Alfred Voss, director of the Institute for Energy Use and Rational Use of Energy at Stuttgart University.</p>
        <p>But Europe has a long way to go before air-conditioning becomes the norm in homes. In Italy, 7 percent of homes are air-conditioned, and in Spain 11 percent, compared with 71 percent in the United States and more than 90 percent in Japan.</p>
        <p>Hotels, post offices, police stations, even hospitals, except for operating rooms, generally do not have air-conditioning.</p>
        <p>So it is hardly surprising that the world's biggest air-conditioner makers -- Japanese giants like Mitsubishi and Daikin Industries, and American leaders like the Carrier Corporation, a unit of United Technologies, and the Trane Company, a unit of American Standard -- view Europe as a potential El Dorado. European companies, like Riello and De Longhi in Italy, are jockeying to catch up.</p>
        <p>''The culture of air-conditioning is spreading,'' said Carlo Segato, head of marketing at De Longhi, a specialist in portable and room air-conditioners.</p>
        <p>But as temperatures climbed over Italy this summer, the country's Green Party, echoing warnings from environmentalists across Europe, argued that air-conditioners, while cooling the inside of homes, forced out warm air, raising temperatures outside. Moreover, they argued, more air-conditioners mean more ozone-depleting gases in the atmosphere, which contribute to global warming. ''Turning on your air-conditioner today,'' said Fulco Pratesi, a Green Party spokesman in Rome, ''means suffering more from the heat tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>The European air-conditioning market did not arrive overnight. It was created after World War II by the companies that pioneered the technology in the United States, including Carrier and the York International Corporation.</p>
        <p>In the 1980's the Japanese arrived. Mitsubishi has a factory in Scotland, Daikin has one in Belgium and Toshiba has one in Britain. And the Japanese got a leg up by introducing small, quiet portables and wall models suited to small European dwellings. The Americans responded quickly. Carrier bought local manufacturers in Spain and Italy and redesigned its products to meet European demands.</p>
        <p>European companies, for their part, took a chapter from the Japanese and copied Japanese models. The Italians introduced snappy new models at competitive prices.</p>
        <p>De Longhi, long a maker of room heaters, began importing Toshiba air-conditioners in 1988, then built its own, and its engineers now use refrigerants that do not damage the atmosphere, including a butane mixture similar to lighter fluid.</p>
        <p>Air-conditioning makers must scramble to find economical substitutes for chlorofluorocarbons, gases traditionally used as refrigerants, which were banned by the Montreal Protocol, a 1987 treaty signed by more than 150 countries, because they deplete the earth's ozone layer.</p>
        <p>Subsequent accords banned the production of the interim substitute, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, after 2020.</p>
        <p>Europe's industry is under particular pressure because Germany, Italy and Sweden, heeding environmentalists, want these gases gone by 2000. When a company in eastern Germany first produced refrigerators using butane in 1992, Greenpeace bought the first 10 prototypes.</p>
        <p>But substitutes are expensive. Sergio Zanolin, De Longhi's head of research, said butane air-conditioners cost 10 percent to 20 percent more than conventional models. While Americans can trundle down to a Home Depot and pick up a window unit for about $200, the least expensive room models in Europe sell for almost $1,000 because of low production runs and expensive components.</p>
        <p>This year De Longhi expects to sell about $165 million worth of air-conditioners and has even carved out a niche in the United States. In part, sales received a boost in Europe from air-conditioning's use as a marketing tool by stores, shopping centers and professional offices of dentists and lawyers.</p>
        <p>''The last five years have seen a revolution in light commercial use,'' said Halsey Cook, Carrier's head of marketing in Europe.</p>
        <p>When automobile air-conditioning caught on in the early 1990's, it was largely thanks to stagnant auto sales, which prompted car makers to offer air-conditioners to attract buyers. Five years ago, hardly any European cars were air-conditioned; now, 28 percent are.</p>
        <p>That may be peanuts compared with the United States, where 95 percent of cars are air-conditioned, but the market continues to grow.</p>
        <p>''It's getting started, people are buying it, and the technology now allows it,'' said Sandro Frigerio, who follows the auto air-conditioning market at Standard &amp; Poor's DRI in London. He said innovation and miniaturization now enabled auto makers to cool small European cars without significant power loss or higher gas consumption.</p>
        <p>And as Europeans grow fond of air-conditioning in cars and dentists' offices, more want it at home.</p>
        <p>Not that sales have exploded. ''The domestic market is really on the edge of a boom,'' said Jacques Benoist, director of certification at Eurovent, an industry association established recently in Paris to certify air-conditioning equipment. ''But it didn't happen yet.''</p>
        <p>And there are many reasons.</p>
        <p>The first, of course, is price, which is compounded by energy problems. In some countries, like Italy, sufficient electricity is scarce. Typical Italian homes are equipped with smaller circuit breakers than new American homes. In Italy, a separate circuit for air-conditioning costs as much as $400.</p>
        <p>Partly, Europe's reluctance can be traced to the relatively mild climate, with little of the tropical heat that assaults cities like Houston or Miami. Yet temperatures in Granada, Spain, or Palermo, Sicily, can easily surpass those in New York. Thus, some experts also point to a tendency for Europeans to favor nature over technology.</p>
        <p>''When they design a building, they take greater advantage of natural lighting and ventilation,'' said Bruce Anderson, head of marketing in Europe for Trane, based in Tyler, Tex. ''So owners will say, 'There's no reason to have air-conditioning.' ''</p>
        <p>Such reluctance is bolstered by a conviction that air-conditioning is unhealthy.</p>
        <p>Italian newspapers, which regularly advise readers how to deal with the heat, warn against it. The weekly health insert of La Repubblica in Rome recently warned readers that air-conditioning could cause colds and sore throats and spread ''germs, viruses and bacteria'' through unclean filters.</p>
        <p>In the United States, many experts argue the opposite. In the recent heat wave, more than 120 deaths were attributed to the heat. Indeed, some European doctors increasingly recommend air-conditioning for the elderly and for people with heart trouble and respiratory ailments.</p>
        <p>In response, European manufacturers have developed quieter and more efficient models. And increased production, economies of scale and cheap foreign imports will cut prices. In television ads, Italian importers offer cheap Chinese air-conditioners free to viewers who order mattresses.</p>
        <p>Moreover, as Europe deregulates the energy market, electricity supplies are expected to rise, thus reducing the cost. In France the national utility, Electricite de France, offers bonuses to builders who install energy-efficient heat pumps, which warm homes in winter and cool them in summer. Italy's national utility, Enel, now penalizes energy use by charging higher rates as more power is consumed. ''Ten to 15 years ago, we had power shortages,'' said Roberto Formigoni, Enel's marketing director. ''Now we have lots to sell.'' So Enel is petitioning Rome's energy authority to cut rates and increase the supply for homes.</p>
        <p>Antonietta Marconi, marketing director of GMC Climatizzatori, where Mr. Liberali bought his equipment, says it cannot happen too soon.</p>
        <p>''I've been in the air-conditioning business for six years, and prices will fall,'' she said. ''It will become like central heating.''</p>
        <p>Professor Voss, of Stuttgart University, agrees. ''With energy prices coming down, I think it's safe to say the tendency will be for demand for appliances like air-conditioners to continue to grow,'' he said.</p>
