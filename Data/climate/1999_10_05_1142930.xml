        <p>Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi ordered emergency inspections today at all of Japan's nuclear-fuel treatment plants and reactors.</p>
        <p>The announcement was made at a gathering of a panel appointed to investigate the nuclear accident on Thursday that severely injured three workers and exposed at least 52 other people to radiation. The order was issued as press accounts described the lackadaisical handling of nuclear materials and careless Government oversight.</p>
        <p>It was widely reported in the Japanese press today that the least seriously injured worker had told investigators that he had no inkling about the risks of a uncontrolled chain reaction when excessive quantities of enriched uranium were gathered in a container. Such a reaction occurred on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Referring to the carelessness and what was apparently a lack of training at the accident site in Tokaimura, 80 miles northeast of here, Mr. Obuchi said plant operators had to insure the ''proper moral discipline'' of the workers.</p>
        <p>Critics of Japan's accident-prone nuclear-power industry seized on the latest comments by embarrassed senior officials that focused responsibility on low-level workers at Tokaimura, saying the Government was missing a sorely needed opportunity to review nuclear policy.</p>
        <p>''The Government is still making statements to blame the accident on the individuals or people around them, and that is wrong,'' said Chihiro Kamisawa, a researcher at the Citizen Nuclear Information Center in Tokyo. ''This incident happened under a system which had been checked and approved by the national Government. So I don't think that the national Government can avoid its own responsibility.''</p>
        <p>To obtain a modicum of energy independence for a resource-poor nation, Mr. Kamisawa and other critics said, the Japanese Government decided decades ago to pursue nuclear power, intensively, particularly a hotly debated plutonium-based strategy that included the Tokaimura plant.</p>
        <p>The policy has remained unshaken by domestic or international pressure, the critics said, even as Japan has won the distinction of what is arguably the world's worst nuclear-safety record in the 1990's. In addition to the accident, Japan suffered an explosion at another processing plant in that town two years ago and a huge leak of radioactive materials at the Monju fast-breeder reactor in 1995.</p>
        <p>The critics here say the accidents stem from a combination of inherently dangerous technologies in a lax regulatory environment at a time of intense international competition. The plutonium-based strategy was largely drafted in response to the oil crises of the 70's, and the Government and industry have felt intense productivity pressures since oil prices have fallen.</p>
        <p>''The level of complacency throughout the bureaucratic safety apparatus is stunning, and it is difficult to understand why, except that their nuclear-fuel prices are up and they have decided that with a need to reduce their costs, safety just gets in the way,'' said Shaun Burnie, research director at Greenpeace International, the environmental group, which strongly opposes nuclear power. ''On top of that, you have an arrogance that says that their nuclear technology is Japanese, and therefore unique. They actually believed that they cannot have accidents here.''</p>
        <p>The emphasis on plutonium makes the nuclear power program virtually unique. Since the 60's, Japan has pursued what experts say is a risky and elusive strategy of developing so-called fast-breeder reactors, machines that produce more plutonium than they burn.</p>
        <p>Despite the allure of a virtually self-replenishing energy source, most other countries have abandoned that approach because of safety concerns, worries about nuclear proliferation and the devilish technical demands that it places on engineers.</p>
        <p>But Japan clings to a national goal of stockpiles of plutonium, despite the fact that the metal is the principal raw material needed for nuclear weapons. Major accidents and huge cost overruns may have led the country to de-emphasize fast-breeders for the time being. But they have not turned Japan away from using plutonium.</p>
        <p>Until the fast-breeder technology is considered mature, the Government has been pushing the burning of plutonium-uranium mixtures in light-water reactors that were built for conventional uranium fuel. International nuclear experts and antinuclear campaigners in Japan have frequently complained that this approach is not just uneconomical, given the higher prices of plutonium compared with uranium, but also far riskier.</p>
        <p>Studies have shown that plutonium used in light-water reactors cannot be completely burned without increasing the risks of a so-called fuel-rupture, or meltdown. But Japanese scientists describe their use of plutonium as posing little technical challenge and, at any rate, forming part of a strategic design of mastering a potentially renewable energy technology before the next global energy crisis.</p>
        <p>''In Japan, as you know, we have no energy resources,'' said a Japanese reactor designer, Dr. Keiji Miyazaki of Osaka University. ''So for the future, we must develop the fast-breeder reactor. Currently it is not necessary for us to make haste in its development. But for energy security in the future, say the latter half of the next century, we will need plutonium use.''</p>
