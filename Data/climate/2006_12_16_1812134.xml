        <p>How balmy has it been in the Alps these last few months? At the bottom of the Hahnenkamm, the famously treacherous downhill course in this Austrian ski resort, the slope peters out into a grassy field. And it's just 10 days before Christmas.</p>
        <p>Snow cannons are showering clouds of white crystals over the slopes, but by midmorning each day, the machines have to be turned off because the mercury has risen too far for the fake snow to stick.</p>
        <p>''Of course I'm nervous about the snow, but what am I supposed to do?'' said Signe Kramheller-Reisch, as she walked in a field outside her family's hotel, wearing suede shoes and a resigned expression. ''We have classic winters and we have nonclassic winters.''</p>
        <p>This season is certainly shaping up as a nonclassic, but it may be a milestone of another kind. The record warmth -- in some places autumn temperatures were three degrees Celsius above average -- has brought home the profound threat of climate change to Europe's ski industry.</p>
        <p>If venturing outdoors without a jacket is not enough evidence, there are two new studies -- one that says the Alps are the warmest they have been in 1,250 years and another that predicts that an increase of a few more degrees would leave most Alpine resorts with too little snow to survive.</p>
        <p>The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which sponsored the second study, stopped short of predicting ruin for Europe's ski industry. But Bruno Abegg, a researcher at the University of Zurich who was involved in it, said low-lying resorts faced an insuperable problem. ''Let's put it this way,'' he said. ''I wouldn't invest in Kitzbühel.''</p>
        <p>People here have heard baleful predictions for years. Because Kitzbühel sits in a low Tyrolean valley, at an altitude of only 2,624 feet, it is viewed as particularly vulnerable to the effects of global warming. (Vail, by contrast, sits at 8,210 feet in the Colorado Rockies).</p>
        <p>For Kitzbühel, a glamorous dowager among Alpine resorts, the only comfort in the warm spell is that it has afflicted rivals at all altitudes. Val d'Isère, in France, and St. Moritz, in Switzerland -- which are twice as high -- were forced to cancel recent World Cup races for lack of snow.</p>
        <p>Among the hoteliers, bartenders and others who depend on the ski trade, the long wait for winter has summoned a stoicism that comes from long experience with the vagaries of Mother Nature.</p>
        <p>''This just happens every few winters,'' said Josef Brandstütter, the owner of a mountaintop hotel, as he nursed a beer at a bar in town. ''We know the snow will come.''</p>
        <p>A few guests have canceled bookings for Christmas week, according to the local tourism office. But most are holding on to see if the weather changes; snow is forecast for Sunday. If it does not snow by New Year's Day, however, people here say the trickle of cancellations could turn into a flood.</p>
        <p>As for the broader threat of global warming, townspeople react with a mixture of fatalism and mild skepticism to studies like the one coordinated by Austria's Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics, which says the Alps have not been this warm since the eighth century.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kramheller-Reisch, whose great-grandfather introduced skiing to Kitzbühel in the 19th century, cited a letter her grandfather wrote in the 1920s, in which he said farmers could not haul wood from the mountains down to the village because there was no snow for their sleds.</p>
        <p>While she does not dispute the inevitability of global warming, Mrs. Kramheller-Reisch, 51, said that for the ski industry in Austria, ''This is not going to be a problem in our lifetimes.''</p>
        <p>Climatologists, however, say the warming trend will become dramatic by 2020. The new studies are alarming, suggesting that the Alps are warming twice as fast as the average in the rest of the world. In 1980, 75 percent of Alpine glaciers were advancing; now, 90 percent are retreating.</p>
        <p>Reinhard Böhm, a meteorologist who worked on the study of Alpine temperatures, said one explanation for the disparity was the region's location in the middle of the European continent, far from any oceans, which react more moderately to global warming trends.</p>
        <p>Temperatures in the Alps began heating up around 1980, Mr. Böhm said, after an uncommonly cool period that started in 1950. This coincided with the major development of the European ski industry.</p>
        <p>Despite the evidence of rapid change, Mr. Böhm said there was little talk of how to prepare for global warming in the resorts. ''Nobody in ski tourism plans out further than 10 years,'' he said. ''If you ask people whether they are interested in the climate in 50 years, they say no.''</p>
        <p>The O.E.C.D. study may focus minds. In Austria today, it says, 83 percent of ski resorts are ''snow-reliable,'' meaning they have enough snow for 100 days a season. If temperatures increased one degree Celsius, only 67 percent would have enough; if they rose two degrees, only half would.</p>
        <p>Like most resorts, Kitzbühel has focused on offering more alternatives to skiing. Most hotels now have saunas and steam rooms befitting the Romans. There is an elaborate town sports center, with curling, climbing and ice hockey. Mrs. Kramheller-Reisch has put in conference facilities.</p>
        <p>Kitzbühel has invested heavily in snowmaking equipment, which will soon cover all the major slopes. The resort has a few advantages: Because farmers use the slopes to graze cattle and sheep in the summer, there are fewer rocks than at other resorts. That means Kitzbühel needs less snow cover.</p>
        <p>Snowmaking, of course, is still hostage to the weather. Even with the machines running full tilt, Kitzbühel will be able to open only 6 or 7 of its 54 lifts this weekend. And snowmaking is extremely expensive, prompting a debate in town about who should pay the bill.</p>
        <p>Climate change need not end in Kitzbühel's extinction, said Georg Hechenberger, a director of the company that runs the resort's cable cars and lifts. One theory, he noted, is that rising temperatures will disrupt the Gulf Stream, plunging northern Europe into a period of chillier weather.</p>
        <p>''In that scenario,'' he said, ''low-lying ski resorts are in good shape. You're not going to feel comfortable at high altitudes.''</p>
