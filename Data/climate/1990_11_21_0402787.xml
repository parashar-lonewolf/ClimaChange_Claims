        <p>For the first hour of tonight's two-hour PBS special, "After the Warming," James Burke bustles through several thousand years in a summer suit, explaining how every momentous occurrence, from the development of writing to the rise and fall of the Roman Empire, to the discovery of America by the Vikings, to the Industrial Revolution was caused by the weather. It's quite a performance, a touch monomaniacal no doubt, but easily as plausible an explanation of history as other such grand theories as Marxism or millennialism. This quick course in climatism can be audited at 9 on Channels 13 and 49.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burke, a British journalist whose earlier public broadcasting series, "The Day the Universe Changed" and "Connections," showed an affinity for the big picture, pretends to be speaking from the year 2050. He does his traveling without moving from what the program's press release calls a "virtual reality" chamber, a big graphics generator that can call up scenes across the centuries and the continents. You may not be fooled.</p>

        <p>For the first hour of tonight's two-hour PBS special, "After the Warming," James Burke bustles through several thousand years in a summer suit, explaining how every momentous occurrence, from the development of writing to the rise and fall of the Roman Empire, to the discovery of America by the Vikings, to the Industrial Revolution was caused by the weather. It's quite a performance, a touch monomaniacal no doubt, but easily as plausible an explanation of history as other such grand theories as Marxism or millennialism. This quick course in climatism can be audited at 9 on Channels 13 and 49.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burke, a British journalist whose earlier public broadcasting series, "The Day the Universe Changed" and "Connections," showed an affinity for the big picture, pretends to be speaking from the year 2050. He does his traveling without moving from what the program's press release calls a "virtual reality" chamber, a big graphics generator that can call up scenes across the centuries and the continents. You may not be fooled.</p>
        <p>If you don't mind phrases like "oodles of boodle" and "gauze from Gaza," Mr. Burke makes a peppy guide as he explains how the industrialization that began in 18th-century England, "when climate stopped doing things to us and when we began doing things to it," brought the globe "greenhouse grief" by the end of the 20th century. For all the novelty of presentation, loyal viewers of public television will hear little new about the consequences of the burning of fossil fuels and the destruction of rain forests in pursuit of development and consumerism. Still, Mr. Burke delivers the hard-to-take news in an easy-to-take way.</p>
        <p>In the second hour, having brought things up to about the year 2,000, Mr. Burke reports from his vantage point in the 21st century on how humanity was saved in the nick. This wishful hour is less plausible than the first and a bit too determinedly edifying to swallow despite the sugar coating of the graphics.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burke's prescription for salvation turns out to be universal cooperation. Through a deal knocked together by the United Nations as the 20th century ends with droughts, floods and social and political upheaval, the countries of the world join in a Planetary Management Authority devoted to developing clean, renewable sources of energy, such as solar power. The goal: "instant energy, zero greenhouse." The new ecologically sound, politically orderly arrangement seems to be run by a coalition of the Greens and the World Federalists.</p>
        <p>The effect on the viewer, given the elaborate graphics, is like playing a science-fiction video game in which you score points for using dung for fuel and lose if you drive to work. Happily, in Mr. Burke's account, as the world settles into the 21st century, the computer is enabling most people to work at home in pleasant villages; those who have to be in a city enjoy clean, efficient underground transportation. Forests are flourishing, and almost nobody eats beef, thereby reducing the emissions of methane gas from flatulent cows. He gives no figures on how much gas television is still sending into the atmosphere.</p>
