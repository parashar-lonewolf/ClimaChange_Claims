        <p>Russia, with the last big economy outside the World Trade Organization, won support for membership in the group from the European Union on Friday and subsequently said it would support the environmental treaty on emissions known as the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
        <p>Russia signed a trade deal with officials representing the 25-nation European Union, Russia's biggest trading partner. The deal, after six years of negotiations, is a political victory for President Vladimir V. Putin. Russia's last remaining major hurdle to joining the 147-trade body is an agreement with the United States.</p>
        <p>Membership in the trade organization has been part of Mr. Putin's plan to integrate Russia into the global economy and promote growth at home. He has promised to double Russia's economy within the decade, a pledge that helped him win a second term last March.</p>
        <p>''Russia must be a member of the W.T.O. and we are striving toward that on conditions acceptable to us,'' Mr. Putin said on Friday. The reversal on Kyoto -- coming just six months after Moscow said it would reject the treaty -- was the key to striking Friday's deal, analysts said.</p>
        <p>''Russia clearly traded its support for Kyoto in exchange for some concessions on W.T.O. entry terms,'' said Christopher Weafer, chief equity strategist with Alfa Bank in Moscow.</p>
        <p>The Bush administration welcomed the news that Russia and the European Union had reached an agreement on Russia's entry into the W.T.O. but cautioned against concluding that Russia would sign the Kyoto Protocol as part of the bargain.</p>
        <p>''We have not been informed of any such decision,'' said Sean McCormick, a spokesman for the National Security Council.</p>
        <p>The protocol, which was completed at a 1997 United Nations conference in Kyoto, Japan, would require the leading industrialized countries to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gasses.</p>
        <p>Kyoto takes effect only when it has been ratified by enough nations to account for 55 percent of 1990 emissions. So far, countries that account for 44 percent of total emissions have ratified the treaty.</p>
        <p>With the withdrawal of the United States in 2001, the pact has depended on support from Russia, which has a 17 percent share of total emissions. In December, however, Moscow declared that it would not ratify the treaty, saying it ran counter to Russia's national interests.</p>
        <p>On Friday, Mr. Putin said he now favored moving toward ratification of the Kyoto pact after years of delay and indecision.</p>
        <p>''We are for the Kyoto process and we support it,'' Mr. Putin told a news conference after the signing the trade deal with the European Union. ''We will speed up the movement on Russia's ratification of the Kyoto Protocol.''</p>
        <p>The support was welcomed by environmental advocates. ''It's great that Russia is beginning to see that participation in W.T.O. and Kyoto Protocol markets can work synergistically to provide economic and environmental benefits,'' said Annie Petsonk, international counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund.</p>
        <p>If the Russian Parliament, or Duma, were to take up the Kyoto Protocol and ratify it in the next few months, she said, ''it is possible that the Kyoto Protocol could enter into force in early 2005.''</p>
        <p>Moscow's support for Kyoto may have helped seal the agreement with the European Union, but such a position will not help Russia in trade talks with the United States. Washington wants Russia to open up its markets quickly and allow competition from American banking and insurance companies, which are largely barred from doing business here.</p>
        <p>The United States also wants agreements with Russia that will give American oil companies access to potential new energy sources in Russia's lightly explored East Siberia, Far East and Arctic regions.</p>
        <p>Last week, Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, met with his Russian counterpart in Paris for three hours.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. Zoellick, Richard Mills, said that progress was being made but that the negotiations had been ''on again, off again from the Russian side.''</p>
        <p>''Different countries have different priorities,'' said Mr. Mills, referring to Europe's request that Russia support the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin's ambition has been to gain W.T.O. membership by the end of the year, although it could be several years before Russia comes in line with all the regulations necessary for membership.</p>
        <p>Still, Friday's agreement shows how important Europe is to Russia's economy. The European Union added 10 new nations this month, and the share of Russia's trade with the bloc jumped as a result to more than 50 percent, up from 35 to 36 percent. Total trade in goods between the enlarged European Union and Russia amounted to about 92 billion euros, or $110 billion, last year, according to Bloomberg News.</p>
        <p>For Europe, the most important element of the agreement was Russia's pledge to raise domestic energy prices slowly, more in line with energy prices Russia charges for export. Europe has long argued that Russia's cheap domestic fuel artificially buoys Russian industry and amounts to a hidden subsidy.</p>
        <p>But the deal does not require Russia to increase the domestic gas price as fast as Brussels had previously requested. Gazprom supplies a quarter of Europe's gas.</p>
        <p>Natural gas fees charged to Russian customers will be gradually increased to $37 to $42 by 2006, up from the current $27 to $28 per thousand cubic meters of natural gas.</p>
        <p>The agreement will also change the fees Russia charges to European Union airlines flying over Siberia, as well as setting limits on fishery products and farm goods tariffs.</p>
        <p>''This is a definite victory for Russia, it's a big diplomatic and practical victory,'' said Stefan Vassilev, the United Nations resident coordinator in the Russian Federation. ''It's not only symbolic but a practical victory.''</p>
