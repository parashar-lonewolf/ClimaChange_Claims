        <p>There were fairies in the gardens at Wave Hill on Saturday night, as well as drowsy cows, giant dancing leaves, Victorian mirages and a sexy naiad, in ''Long-Distance Calls and Close-up Dances,'' a program of pieces by Remy Charlip and friends that opened the summer Dancescape program at that beautiful environmental center in the Riverdale section of the Bronx.</p>
        <p>The fairies were elfin children trained by Ellen Robbins, who performed ''Rainbow Towel Ensemble: His'' and ''Rainbow Towel Ensemble: Hers,'' to music by Mozart and Bartok, respectively. Charming, soft-edged semaphoric dances, they were conceived, as were many of the program's pieces, as drawings by Mr. Charlip, also a noted writer and illustrator of children's books, and interpreted by Remy Charlip's International All-Star Dance Company, a collection of quirkily, mysteriously expressive performers who have danced with Mr. Charlip over the years.</p>
        <p>The Victorian mirages were Toby Armour and Sally Hess, dressed in flowing colored robes and moving gently in a distant greenhouse to music by Chopin, in ''The Greenhouse Effect.'' The naiad was Amy Nakazato, who performed beside a lily pond in ''Wet Towel Dance,'' to music by King Sunny Ade. Dressed in a star-spangled blue overall, Toby Towson balanced on a ball painted like the earth, a gold sun ball and a silver moon ball beside it, in the company of fireflies, in ''Heels Over Head.'' Performed on a small circular stone stairway, the solo was danced to Ravel with a wry autobiographical monologue spoken by Mr. Towson, a gymnast, dancer and environmentalist. And Phoebe Neville and Tryntje Shapli climbed, balanced and draped themselves monumentally over two freestanding white staircases in ''Three Steps,'' a stylish duet set to music by Schubert.</p>
        <p>Mr. Charlip's friends were well represented, too. Lance Westergard's ''Memory Lingers, Part III, for Tudor'' was a witty and poignant dance made of phrases from ballets by Antony Tudor, set to Dvorak and danced by the quietly riveting Mr. Westergard. Wearing papery cow and bull skulls, Tine Byrsted, Pat Cremins and John Ingle materialized and evaporated in Ms. Cremins's ''Hiding.'' And the lives and loves of three huge leaves were immortalized in Barbara Roan's lumbering, capering and very funny ''Fall Preview,'' danced by Ms. Roan, Amy Berkman and Robert Simpson to music from the ''Summer'' section of Vivaldi's ''Four Seasons.''</p>
        <p>Part Buster Keaton, part Tinkerbell, Tracy Rhoades served as master of ceremony and contributed two strong pieces. ''Spin Cycle'' combined baton, rubber phallus and cross-twirling with political commentary. ''Requiem'' was a plain-spoken elegy for a lost lover. Mr. Rhoades's slightly blank delivery in both was compelling, but also a little distancing.</p>
        <p>A wise and wicked observer of life and fantasy, Mr. Charlip is a miniaturist who would seem an odd choice for the sprawling Dancescape festival, directed by Earl Tucker. But the choice was as inspired as Mr. Charlip's use of Wave Hill. Sadly, this will be the last season of Dancescape, one of several Wave Hill programs scheduled for cancellation because of a deficit.</p>
