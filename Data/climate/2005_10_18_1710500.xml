        <p>The Question on Comets</p>
        <p>Dirty ice ball or icy dirt ball? For scientists who study comets, that is perhaps the question.

Since comets are believed to have lingered since the dawn of the solar system, their composition offers clues to conditions back then.</p>

        <p>The Question on Comets</p>
        <p>Dirty ice ball or icy dirt ball? For scientists who study comets, that is perhaps the question. Are comets largely frozen water and carbon dioxide with some rock and dust mixed in, or mostly rubble, peppered with ice? Since comets are believed to have lingered since the dawn of the solar system, their composition offers clues to conditions back then.</p>
        <p>The dirty ice ball theory had been favored by many scientists since it was first proposed more than half a century ago. But some recent evidence has suggested that comets may be more dirt than ice.</p>
        <p>The latest finding to point in that direction comes from the Deep Impact mission, a NASA spacecraft that slammed an 800-pound projectile into the comet Tempel 1 on July 4. The impact was observed by instruments all over the world and in space, including an array of cameras aboard a European Space Agency spacecraft, Rosetta, that is on its way to another comet.</p>
        <p>A team of scientists from many European institutions has analyzed the Rosetta data and concluded that while the impact produced a shower of water vapor, it probably produced more dust. Their findings are reported in the journal Nature.</p>
        <p>A spectroscopic camera on Rosetta was used to determine the amount of water released, by measuring hydroxyl radicals, which are produced as light from the sun breaks down the water molecules. An optical camera was used to measure the dust.</p>
        <p>The dust measurements are a bit iffier -- the researchers had to make certain assumptions about the size of the particles, for instance -- so the data do not conclusively prove that comets are more dirt ball than ice ball. Rosetta's own probe may settle the issue in nine years, when it is scheduled to land on the comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko.</p>
        <p>Protein Study a Bit of a Stretch</p>
        <p>The secret behind the remarkable jumping ability of fleas is a highly elastic polymerized protein called resilin. A pad of resilin between the flea's leg and its body stretches like a bow string, storing energy.</p>
        <p>When the energy is released the leg opens rapidly, catapulting the flea into the air.</p>
        <p>Resilin, a polymer, is found in crickets, all kinds of flies and many other insects, as well. And now it has been synthesized in a lab by Australian scientists. The artificial resilin, they write in Nature, may someday prove to be a useful biomaterial -- not to help people jump higher, but as a replacement for other elastic proteins in the body, like those that keep arteries flexible.</p>
        <p>The compound was created using genetic engineering techniques. A part of a fruit fly gene that encodes for a resilin-like compound (which gives the wings flexibility) was inserted into E. coli bacteria. The bacteria then produced the protein, called rec1-resilin. By mixing the protein with other chemicals, putting the resulting solution in molds and exposing it to light, cross-links were formed between the protein molecules, forming a polymer.</p>
        <p>The researchers found that their resilin was highly resilient: it can be stretched to more than three times its length, but resumes it original shape once released. The artificial resilin, in fact, was more resilient than polybutadiene, one of the stretchier rubbers made.</p>
        <p>A Truly Old World Creature</p>
        <p>A dinosaur fossil unearthed in Patagonia a year ago has been identified as a dromaeosaur, a type that is related to birds. The finding, by Peter J. Makovicky of the Field Museum in Chicago and two Argentine scientists, means that dromaeosaurs may be older than previously thought.</p>
        <p>The creature, Buitreraptor gonzalezorum, was a little smaller than a turkey, with a long neck and a long tail. Like other dromaeosaurs, it would have been able to run rapidly on two feet.</p>
        <p>Although the fossil is about 90 million years old, it pushes the origin of dromaeosaurs back much further. The finding is proof that the family of dinosaurs existed before Pangaea, the supercontinent that consisted of all the world's land, split into a northern mass called Laurasia and a southern mass, Gondwana. That split was completed by the late Jurassic, about 150 million years ago.</p>
        <p>Spider Likes Its Meals Rare, in Fact, Bloody</p>
        <p>Jumping spiders are the big cats of the arachnid world, stalking their prey like mountain lions and pouncing when it gets close. The spiders are aided in their hunting by keen vision, with four pairs of eyes.</p>
        <p>Among the roughly 5,000 species of jumping spiders, an East African one stands out for its discriminating taste in prey. Researchers have discovered that the spider, Evarcha culicivora, which is less than half an inch long, has a penchant for mosquitoes that have recently gorged on blood. The spiders cannot pierce the skin of a person or animal to get blood on their own, so they obtain it indirectly, and let the mosquitoes do the dirty work for them.</p>
        <p>The spiders are found in mud houses in parts of Kenya and Uganda that border Lake Victoria. Those houses tend to be very dark, said one of the researchers, Ximena J. Nelson of Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, and jumping spiders need a lot of light to see. ''That leads to the question of why they are here,'' Dr. Nelson said. ''There must be some kind of prey that's of interest to them.''</p>
        <p>The prey, she and her colleagues found, are the mosquitoes that are ubiquitous in the region (including Anopheles gambiae, a major transmitter of malaria). In their experiments, described in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers found that the spiders chose female mosquitoes that had recently had a meal of blood over females that had been fed sugar, males (which do not eat blood) and midges and other insects.</p>
        <p>Dr. Nelson said the spiders chose their prey based on odor and on size -- juvenile spiders chose smaller mosquitoes, and adult spiders picked larger ones. ''But the presence of blood overrides size preference,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Once it chooses its prey, the spider jumps on it and injects a paralyzing venom followed by digestive enzymes. Then the spider sucks up the fluids. Juvenile spiders, which are far smaller than the mosquitoes, jump on their victims from underneath; then they hold on for dear life while the insect flies around for a minute or so until the venom takes effect.</p>
        <p>It is unclear why the spiders have adapted to eating blood. Dr. Nelson said this is the first case in which a member of the animal kingdom chooses prey based on what the prey has eaten. ''The only other possibility might be humans,'' she said. ''I guess we feed our cows things to make them taste better.''</p>
