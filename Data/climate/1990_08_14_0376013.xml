        <p>LEAD: THOUSANDS of surgeons are learning a new technique for removing gallbladders that could greatly simplify the operations now performed on some 500,000 Americans each year.</p>

        <p>LEAD: THOUSANDS of surgeons are learning a new technique for removing gallbladders that could greatly simplify the operations now performed on some 500,000 Americans each year.</p>
        <p>THOUSANDS of surgeons are learning a new technique for removing gallbladders that could greatly simplify the operations now performed on some 500,000 Americans each year.</p>
        <p>The technique, called laparoscopic cholecystectomy, offers stunning health, financial and cosmetic advantages over the standard operation, surgeons say. Instead of cutting open the abdomen to reach the gallbladder, as is currently standard procedure, surgeons can now simply cut several small holes in the abdomen through which they insert a camera and surgical instruments.</p>
        <p>Although the laparoscopic technique has been used by gynecologists for many years to diagnose and treat reproductive problems in women, it is new to general surgeons. Its possible future applications may be limited only by surgeons' imaginations and the development of equipment. Some have already used the technique to perform appendectomies and intestinal surgery. In the last two months surgeons at Washington University in St. Louis used the technique to remove a kidney in two patients. And surgeons elsewhere are exploring the possibility of laparoscopic chest surgery.</p>
        <p>But the technique is being applied most rapidly to remove gallbladders that have been inflamed by gallstones. The gallbladder is a pear-shaped sac about four inches long that stores bile that is made in the liver. After a meal the stored bile is released to aid in digestion. Stones that commonly form in the gallbladder can cause severe inflammation. For unknown reasons, gallstones are more common among women than men.</p>
        <p>Small stones can pass out of the gallbladder to block bile in the main bile duct, causing the skin and thus to yellow the skin from jaundice. Stones in the bile duct can lead to life-threatening infections. Surgical removal of the gallbladder and the gallstones is standard therapy.</p>
        <p>''The procedure is spreading like wildfire through the country,'' said Dr. Charles McSherry, who does the laparoscopic procedure at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York.</p>
        <p>In New York City the other day, surgeons at the St. Luke's division of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Centermade four small slits in a woman's abdomen to insert a camera and then watched on a video screen as they manipulated the long instruments through the holes to cut out her gallbladder.</p>
        <p>A little more than an hour later the diseased gallbladder and the dozens of small stones contained in it slithered through her navel. The only scars were the puncture holes that were stitched and covered with small bandages.</p>
        <p>After an overnight stay in the hospital, the woman went home; she was back to her normal activities within the week. Some such patients go home the day of the operation.</p>
        <p>The laparoscopic cholecystectomy enables such a rapid recovery because it avoids slicing the major muscles of the abdomen through the six-inch incision used in the operation that has been standard for a century.</p>
        <p>The older operation keeps a patient in the hospital for up to a week and restricts physical activity for about six weeks while the major muscles of the abdomen heal.</p>
        <p>The Bandwagon</p>
        <p>No Standards Set In Rush to Learn</p>
        <p>Many experts believe laparoscopic cholecystectomy will eventually replace the standard operation for most of the 500,000 Americans who have their gallstones and diseased gallbladders removed each year, though the final word is not in.</p>
        <p>But medical experts are concerned that too many surgeons are being trained too fast in courses that vary in length and quality.</p>
        <p>Some courses last a day, others three days. In some courses surgeons practice on pigs, whose gallbladder anatomy most closely resembles that of humans. In other courses, no animal work is done. Some doctors do their first few cases only when a more experienced colleague assists them. Others tackle a case straightaway.</p>
        <p>In the rush, surgeons have rejected suggestions that the procedure be confined to specialized medical centers until its track record is established. ''Hopes for critical assessment of the procedure have pretty much gone by the boards,'' Dr. McSherry said.</p>
        <p>No one knows precisely how many surgeons have taken courses to learn the new technique or how many such procedures have been done in the United States. Dr. Eddie Joe Reddick of Nashville, and a pioneer of the technique, estimated that 5,000 have taken an introductory course and about 200 have actually done several thousand cases.</p>
        <p>Surgeons perform the new procedure in its entirety by watching a video monitor connected to the laparoscope, a device that contains a light and a camera that magnifies the image 16 times.</p>
        <p>Manipulating instruments under such circumstances requires development of tactile senses, manual dexterity and other surgical skills entirely different from those used in open operations. The skills are easily learned but take time and experience to master.</p>
        <p>Steering Underwater</p>
        <p>To a visitor watching the new procedure, it was as if the surgeons were navigating a submarine through underwater glaciers while watching its progress on a video monitor.</p>
        <p>The gallbladder is attached to the underside of the liver in the upper right side of the abdomen just beneath the rib cage where organs are so tightly packed that complications from surgery can be disastrous.</p>
        <p>Bile, which aids in digestion, is made in the liver and flows through ducts to the small intestine. As it passes through the main duct, much of the bile is channeled to the gallbladder, where it is stored until it is needed after a meal. Removal of the gallbladder does not interfere with digestion.</p>
        <p>The main concerns of surgical injury are bleeding and damage to the main bile duct. Surgeons who have learned the technique talk about the potential catastrophes from the new operation but can offer little data, in part because central registries are not kept for operations.</p>
        <p>The procedure has been carried out in many hospitals across the country. But the number of operations are limited for now by a backlog of orders for the laparoscope and other key instruments, which are made by hand, principally by two companies in West Germany.</p>
        <p>In about 10 percent of cases with the new procedure, surgeons encounter technical difficulties or a complication that force an immediate switch to the standard operation. For this reason, patients are asked to sign a consent form to cover the possible need for both procedures.</p>
        <p>The American College of Surgeons in Chicago says the new procedure should be performed by surgeons who are qualified to do the standard operation and who know how to do the operations for the complications of gallbladder disease.</p>
        <p>Swing to Surgery</p>
        <p>Other Treatments Lose Their Luster</p>
        <p>Beyond demand from patients, the race to learn the laparoscopic technique reflects vested interests of surgeons who were threatened with losing the abdominal operation they do most often to competition from other recently developed techniques. Among them are drugs, lithotripter machines that smash gallstones with shock waves andeven a type of ether that can dissolve them.</p>
        <p>But the new procedure appears to be swinging the balance back to surgery, as the alternatives generally either require continuing medication or leave the possibility of new gallstones and recurrent gallbladder attacks because the gallbladder is left in place.</p>
        <p>Dr. Karl A. Zucker of the University of Maryland said that some medical centers have shut down their gallstone lithotripters because of high costs and a far more limited number of candidates than originally projected.</p>
        <p>When surgeons began developing the gallbladder laparoscopic operation in France and Tennessee two years ago, they generally chose patients for whom the gallbladder operation was an elective procedure.</p>
        <p>But as surgeons gained experience, some became more aggressive, even tackling patients with acute gallbladder attacks and with complications from gallstones or with other major diseases. Most have been reported to be successful with few complications but there have been a paucity of published reports.</p>
        <p>When gallstones become stuck in the main bile duct, causing jaundice and other potentially life-threatening problems, they can be removed through another technique. This procedure involves passing a flexible tube with a lens, light and attachments through the mouth to the small intestine and then manipulating the device to enter the bile duct to remove the stones. Depending on the circumstances in each case, the procedure can be done before or after laparoscopy is used to remove the gallbladder.</p>
        <p>The Operation</p>
        <p>Video Monitors, Hooks and Scissors</p>
        <p>Though the techniques of laparoscopic cholecystectomy vary among surgeons, the procedure is usually performed by a team of three surgeons. All look at the video monitor to watch the instruments being maneuvered through the holes in the abdomen.</p>
        <p>In general, the operator manipulates long hooks, scissors and other instruments to dissect the tissue around the gallbladder.</p>
        <p>The first assistant uses clasps to put tension on the gallbladder to make it easier for the operator to cut.</p>
        <p>The third surgeon is a camera operator who keeps the lens focused on the anatomy so the others can see what they are doing. The camera operator does no cutting.</p>
        <p>While some hospitals now have the equipment needed for the laparoscopic gallbladder operation, others do not expect to receive it for several months. Some surgeons use equipment brought in for the day by the manufacturers.</p>
        <p>A Day of Surgery</p>
        <p>2 Successes, 1 Complication</p>
        <p>The other day, Michael Morton of Karl Storz, a medical supply company of Culver City, Calif., brought the equipment to St. Luke's Hospital in New York City for use by Dr. Robert E. Miller and Dr. Fred Kimmelstiel. The two doctors had learned the procedure in a course in Kansas City, Kan., and had watched other surgeons experienced in the technique before they themselves did their first case.</p>
        <p>The three operations they performed this day illustrate the success and limitations of the laparoscopic procedure.</p>
        <p>The procedure went smoothly in two women. However, in a third case of a 68-year-old man, the surgeons had to switch to the standard operation after spending more than an hour trying to cut through a web of adhesions, or scar tissue, that had formed as a result of previous operations. The surgeons were able to cut through the tangle, but when they reached the gallbladder they found it was too rigid and scarred for them to grasp it safely with their instruments. There was no way for the surgeons to have known this before they began the procedure.</p>
        <p>Even after opening up the operating area by resorting to the standard procedure, they had to leave part of the gallbladder because it was imbedded in the liver and could not be safely removed in its entirety.</p>
        <p>The successful operations began after the patient fell unconscious from a general anesthesia. The surgeons cut through the navel, or umbilicus, which offered the easiest entry to the abdomen.</p>
        <p>Then the surgeons inserted a tube connected to a machine that inflated the abdomen with carbon dioxide, making the patient look pregnant. The gas separated the abdominal muscles beneath the skin and the organs in the abdomen, creating a wide area in which the surgeons could safely work.</p>
        <p>Then they inserted a laparoscope and dimmed the overhead lights in the operating room. A clear picture of what the surgeons could not see with their naked eye appeared on a video monitor.</p>
        <p>The surgeons cut three more holes in the abdomen and began inserting the instruments to reach the gallbladder. (For patients who have scars near the navel from previous surgery, surgeons sometimes make the holes elsewhere in the abdomen.) As they cut away scar and other tissue, the surgeons found the dissection tougher in some places than others, in part because the instruments they and most other surgeons use are borrowed from laparoscopic gynecological procedures and are crude for gallbladder surgery.</p>
        <p>''Get a better grasp,'' Dr. Kimmelstiel told Dr. Miller as the surgeons cautiously moved their instruments, making sure they were not cutting a blood vessel.</p>
        <p>''Look, there's a small branch of the cystic artery,'' Dr. Miller said, pointing to a vessel that feeds the gallbladder. He expressed amazement over the clarity of the laparoscope's magnification, which allowed his team to see anatomical details that would have gone unnoticed in the standard operation.</p>
        <p>But the magnification requires some adjustment. ''The first time I saw the new procedure, a trickle of blood seemed like a flood,'' Dr. Miller said.</p>
        <p>When they reached the gallbladder, it appeared as a big tear drop. As one step, they squeezed the handle of an instrument to place two sets of titanium clips over the artery that fed the gallbladder. One set of clips would remain in the body, and the other would be removed with the gallbladder after the surgeons cut between the two sets of clips.</p>
        <p>In a similar step, the surgeons removed the tube that drains bile from the gallbladder into the main duct that leads to the small intestine.</p>
        <p>Then they teased the gallbladder away from its attachment to the liver by applying an electrical current to burn the tissue. Some surgeons use a laser to do the cutting.</p>
        <p>After they used suction to remove the bile from the gallbladder, they pulled the gallbladder through the tube in the navel. In this case there were about 40 small stones in the gallbladder sac. But some gallstones can be an inch or more in diameter, and if they are too big to slither through the tube, the surgeon can crush the stone or enlarge the incision.</p>
        <p>''It looks beautiful,'' Dr. Kimmelstiel said as his team checked for any bleeding before they deflated the abdomen by removing the carbon dioxide. Some gas inevitably remains and causes discomfort for a day or two until the body gradually absorbs it.</p>
        <p>Then the surgeons put a few stitches in the skin to close the holes and placed bandages over the incision.</p>
        <p>Clear View Of Gallbladder</p>
        <p>Four small punctures in the abdomen allow insertion of a small television camera and instruments. While one surgeon acts as camera man, other surgeons watch the procedure on the television screen as they manipulate the instruments. The gallbladder is attached to the under surface of the liver.</p>
        <p>Instruments put traction on the diseased organ and surgeon attaches clips to artery and duct, then cuts between the clips. Then surgeons work to wrest the gallbladder from its attachment to the liver. Once released, the gallbladder is pulled through one of the small holes. The patient usually goes home the next day, with only four punctures to form scars.</p>
        <p>Smaller Scars From New Operation</p>
        <p>In the old technique, a long incision was needed to reach the gallbladder, making it necessary to cut through the muscles of the abdominal wall, as shown at left. In the new method, instruments and cameras are inserted through small punctures; injury to abdominal muscles is greatly reduced.</p>
