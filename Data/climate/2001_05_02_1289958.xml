        <p>Consolidated Edison plans to restart the most polluting power plant in New York City, a small, dormant generator in Brooklyn. State regulators, eager to increase the city's power supply, have tentatively agreed to let it resume operation without an environmental review.</p>
        <p>The plant, a part of the Hudson Avenue Generating Station, near the Brooklyn Navy Yard, was built in 1951, long before there were emissions standards. It burns oil, a much dirtier fuel than the natural gas used by newer plants.</p>
        <p>Resuming the plant's operation reflects the delicate balance the state and utilities face in trying to find as many electricity sources as possible in case of potential power shortages this summer.</p>
        <p>''The reason that we want to restart the plant is the power situation in the city,'' said Peter Lanahan, vice president for environmental health and safety at Con Edison, citing warnings of possible power shortages this summer or next. Restarting the plant would also allow the company to reap a small share of the windfall that power-plant owners have gained in the last year from high electricity prices.</p>
        <p>But environmentalists point out that the plant, at 60 megawatts, would produce a tiny fraction of the city's peak daily power need of more than 10,000 megawatts. The plant would create more pollution, per pound of fuel consumed or per megawatt of power produced, than any other power plant in the city, according to data compiled by the federal and state governments, and an analysis by the Natural Resources Defense Council. There are several much larger plants that emit more pollution, but they also produce far more electricity.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists and some state legislators argue that reviving the plant would be illegal. They have complained to the state that the project circumvented rules on obtaining permits for sources of pollution, that it must undergo a complete environmental impact review, and that it might be subject to the same stringent emissions standards as a new plant faces. ''We think the way they're going about this violates all sorts of laws,'' said Keri Powell, a lawyer with the New York Public Interest Research Group.</p>
        <p>Con Edison mothballed the plant in 1997, and applied to the state for emissions credits that it earned by eliminating a source of air pollution. Under the emissions credit program, companies that violate clean air standards can use the credits to keep their plants running. But in a novel twist, Con Edison, rather than selling the credits, proposes to use them to obtain a state permit to restart the same plant.</p>
        <p>Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, the author of the state law on pollution credits, said those credits could be earned only when a source of pollution is eliminated permanently. ''So what they're doing is patently illegal,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''That's not our understanding,'' Mr. Lenahan said, adding that the company knows of no requirement that a plant be closed forever to earn credits. He said that the plant meets ''all of the applicable air standards.'' Plants built before 1970 do not have to meet the current standards.</p>
        <p>The Department of Environmental Conservation, the state agency that has given tentative approval to reopening the plant, would not comment directly on Hudson Avenue or its handling of Con Edison's application. But a department spokeswoman, Jennifer Post, noted that the level of smog in New York City had declined sharply in the last decade -- although it continues to violate federal clean-air standards -- and that Gov. George E. Pataki has pledged that the state will demand sharp emissions cuts from older power plants, starting in 2003.</p>
        <p>''New York has some of the strictest standards in the nation, requiring utilities to emit far less pollutants than utilities in virtually any other state outside the Northeast,'' she said. ''We will closely monitor this plant and require it to adhere to the state's strict standards.''</p>
        <p>Ashok Gupta of the Natural Resources Defense Council, one of the groups opposing the project, said Hudson Avenue proves that a consensus needs to be reached on building new power plants, because the alternative is to rely more heavily on older plants that pollute more. Environmental groups have opposed construction of some of the new plants, arguing, among other thing, that increased energy conservation is needed as well.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, the Department of Environmental Conservation issued a notice that it intended to grant Con Edison a permit to re-start the Hudson Avenue generator. The department determined that the company did not need to conduct an environmental impact review. Several Assembly Democrats, including Speaker Sheldon Silver, sent a letter to the department today, calling on it not to grant the permit, and to require a full environmental review.</p>
        <p>When demand for electricity rose last summer, electric bills surged, and state regulators have warned of more price spikes and possible blackouts and brownouts. Several major new power plants have been proposed, but they remain at least three years away.</p>
        <p>The Pataki administration has been struggling to find new sources of electricity by summer to avoid a crisis, but some of those efforts have run into opposition from environmental and community groups.</p>
        <p>State agencies have adopted policies encouraging businesses that own diesel generators, intended as backup power in case of blackouts, to use them for limited periods this summer, to ease the demand on the power grid. Environmentalists say that such diesel generators pollute far more than power plants do, and have threatened to sue to block the plan.</p>
        <p>The New York Power Authority is installing 10 small power plants in the city and one on Long Island to add about 400 megawatts to the power supply. Lawsuits to stop the projects have failed to stop construction so far.</p>
        <p>Community groups and state legislators complained that the miniplants were slated for poor, mostly minority communities. Environmentalists argued that while the generators might be a good idea, the state was required to conduct an environmental impact review before installing them.</p>
        <p>But the Power Authority's miniplants, each producing up to 44 megawatts of power, burn gas and would use some of the cleanest technology available. Department of Environmental Conservation documents show a vast disparity in the level of pollution they would produce, compared to Hudson Avenue.</p>
        <p>For example, each Power Authority plant would emit up to 20 tons per year of nitrogen oxide, the main contributor to smog, compared to 825 tons for the Hudson Avenue plant. The Power Authority plants' output of sulfur dioxide, the main contributor to acid rain, would be close to zero, compared to 918 tons per year at Hudson Avenue. Even when compared to other oil-burning plants in the city, Hudson Avenue would pollute about twice as much for each pound of fuel used.</p>
        <p>''This thing is an environmental disaster,'' said Assemblyman Joan L. Millman, whose district includes the plant. ''We will go to court if we have to stop this.''</p>
        <p>Con Edison sold off its major power plants as part of a state-sponsored restructuring of the power industry, but it kept several smaller plants that are used to generate both electricity and steam, which the company sells for heating some buildings.</p>
        <p>The Hudson Avenue plant, part of the steam system, has four separate units. Three of them have remained in operation, though they have barely been used in recent years.</p>
