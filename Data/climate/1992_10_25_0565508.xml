        <p>ECONOMY AND TAXES</p>
        <p>Robert Abrams, Democrat: Favors phased reduction in military spending to $145 billion in the year 2000, or roughly half the military spending forecast by the Bush Administration for that year. Would use part of the estimated $900 billion to $1 trillion savings for deficit reduction and part for investment in infrastructure, housing and schools. Favors tax credits of up to 20 percent for businesses and industries that invest in plant modernization or defense-industry conversion, and of up to 30 percent for research and development. Opposes any increase in personal taxes.</p>

        <p>ECONOMY AND TAXES</p>
        <p>Robert Abrams, Democrat: Favors phased reduction in military spending to $145 billion in the year 2000, or roughly half the military spending forecast by the Bush Administration for that year. Would use part of the estimated $900 billion to $1 trillion savings for deficit reduction and part for investment in infrastructure, housing and schools. Favors tax credits of up to 20 percent for businesses and industries that invest in plant modernization or defense-industry conversion, and of up to 30 percent for research and development. Opposes any increase in personal taxes.</p>
        <p>Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican: Opposes any tax increases. Favors a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. Has proposed a two-year freeze in Federal spending, except for Social Security. Favors tax credits for first-time home buyers, and restoring full deductibility for I.R.A. accounts. Wants private enterprise zones to help rebuild inner cities, and privatization of some Government services.  HEALTH  Abrams: Favors a national health insurance program, backed by Congressional Democrats, to provide benefits to all Americans, in place of more than 1,500 private insurance plans now in place. Says the national plan would be financed through a new payroll tax (in lieu of premiums employers now pay) higher corporate taxes, and higher taxes on alcohol and tobacco. Favors condom distribution in schools and needle exchanges to fight AIDS.  D'Amato: Favors plans backed by Congressional Republicans to offer vouchers to poor families that could be used only to buy medical insurance, and tax deductions for families with incomes below $80,000, plus the deduction of medical insurance premiums for the self-employed. Supports changes in medical malpractice and laws to hold down medical costs. Opposes needle exchanges. Supports supervised condom distribution in schools as long as parents can elect that their children not participate. THE MILITARY  Abrams:  Says military spending cuts of nearly $280 billion over the next five years should be used for "victory fund" to revitalize the economy. Proposes to reduce total troop strength to 1.1 million from 2.1 million, Army divisions to 7 from 18, Air Force fighter craft to 800 from 1,728. Also favors large cuts in strategic nuclear warheads.  D'Amato: Favors cuts in military spending of $85 billion over the next five years, emphasizing troop reductions in Europe, leaving a total of about 100,000, fewer than the 150,000 the Bush Administration wants. This would comprise one heavy Army corps, six Air Force tactical wings and Navy headquarters and support units for the Sixth Fleet. THE ENVIRONMENT Abrams: Favors increased Federal support for recycling and the imposition of minimum standards for recycled content in packaging and paper. Supports Earth Summit limits on emission of greenhouse gases, and favors stricter energy efficiency standards for automobiles and appliances. Favors more stringent review of pesticides and stronger Federal open-space provisions and conservation incentives. D'Amato: Has taken a grab-bag of positions on environmental issues. Has fought vigorously for mass transit money and stricter fuel emission standards, but voted against cleaning up contaminated Department of Energy nuclear waste centers. Has voted both for and against restoring United States financing to the United Nations Population Fund. ABORTION Abrams: Favors abortion rights and opposes restrictions like parental notification for teen-agers or 24-hour waiting periods. Supports Medicaid financing for abortions for poor women, though his office is required by law to defend a state law that provides money for prenatal care, but not abortions, for some women with incomes above the poverty level. D'Amato: Opposes abortion, and has endorsed a proposed constitutional amendment holding that life begins at conception. In the past, he opposed abortion except to save the life of the mother, but now says he also favors exceptions in cases of rape and incest. Favors parental notification. Twice voted to uphold the gag rule prohibit federally financed family planning clinics from dispensing advice about abortions, but recently voted against it.  CRIME: Abrams: Opposes the death penalty, but supports an alternative statute that would mandate life in prison without parole for certain crimes, including murder. Supports stricter handgun controls and a ban on assault weapons. Favors increased Federal support for enforcement of state and local drug laws and for residential drug treatment programs. D'Amato: Favors the death penalty for murder or contract killings ordered by drug lords. Has opposed some gun control laws, but voted for the Brady Bill to require a waiting period for handgun purchases nationwide. Sought to make street handgun slayings a Federal crime, punishable by death. CIVIL RIGHTS Abrams: Favors Federal legislation providing benefits to domestic partners regardless of sexual orientation. Favors Federal law to bar discrimination against homosexuals. Pledges to support new Federal laws to punish bias-motivated violence. D'Amato: Cast a deciding vote to let stand President Bush's veto of the Civil Rights Act of 1990, arguing that the bill would lead employers to use quotas. Says the Federal Government should "do more" to protect the civil rights of all Americans, whatever their "predilection," but has not specified how. EDUCATION Abrams: Favors loan program to allow every American student to borrow up to $10,000 per year to finance college education, with the money repaid through future tax filings on a scale linked to income levels. Opposes prayer in schools, and tuition tax credits for private and parochial schools. D'Amato: Favors tuition tax credits for private and parochial schools, and giving parents of public school students the right to select which school their children can attend. Supports voluntary prayer in the schools. Favors expanding existing loan programs for college students, and a new plan in which loans would be repaid on a sliding scale pegged to income. FOREIGN AFFAIRS Abrams: Says that the United States is "the world's only remaining superpower, but should not attempt to be the world's super-policeman." Says European allies should take lead in forging a peaceful solution in the former Yugoslav states. Refused to say unequivocally until the Persian Gulf War ended whether he favored that use of military force. Sharply criticized the Bush Administration for delaying loan guarantees to Israel. D'Amato: Was a sharp early critic of Saddam Hussein and a proponent of the Persian Gulf War. An early supporter of independence for the Baltic states, and strong backer of Israel. Warns that despite the end of the cold war, "this is still a dangerous world." Supports coordinated United States-European action to provide cover for humanitarian relief in Bosnia.</p>
