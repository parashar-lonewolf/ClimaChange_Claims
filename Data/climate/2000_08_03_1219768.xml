        <p>General Motors challenged Ford today to a battle over which company can deliver bigger improvements in fuel economy, particularly for sport utility vehicles, the least efficient vehicles of all.</p>
        <p>Ford committed itself last week to improve the average mileage of its sport utility vehicles by almost five miles a gallon over the next five years. General Motors announced today that no matter how much Ford improved the energy efficiency of its sport utilities by 2005, G.M.'s sport utilities would average even more miles to the gallon by then.</p>
        <p>The announcements affect half of all the sport utilities sold in the country -- about 800,000 by each automaker.</p>
        <p>G.M. also upped the ante, saying that the overall fuel economy for all its light trucks -- a category including minivans and pickups as well as sport utilities -- would be better than Ford's in 2005.</p>
        <p>''G.M. will still be the leader in five years, and in 15 years for that matter,'' said Harry Pearce, G.M.'s vice chairman, at a news conference today in this Detroit suburb.</p>
        <p>Ford vowed last week to raise its sport utilities' mileage by 25 percent, from a little over 18 miles a gallon now. Ford also said that it would improve the fuel economy of its minivans and pickups, and planned future announcements to give more precise figures, after performing additional engineering studies. Mr. Pearce's comments today effectively pre-empted Ford's next move, by committing G.M. to exceed in average light truck fuel economy whatever Ford does. The world's two largest automakers make nearly half the nation's minivans and pickup trucks.</p>
        <p>Automakers have been trumpeting the occasional fuel-economy improvement in various models for years, but have typically offset these gains by making other vehicles more powerful and less efficient. The G.M. and Ford announcements are the first instances of big domestic automakers committing themselves voluntarily to significant increases in the average fuel economy of large classes of vehicles.</p>
        <p>Why, after merely two decades of no significant improvement in the fuel economy of light trucks, are G.M. and Ford reversing course? Both companies said their market research had found growing interest in better fuel economy. Foreign automakers are stepping up their sales of sport utilities and showing that they do not have to be gas guzzlers, partly because the foreign brands are often based on lightweight car underbodies instead of cheap but heavy pickup truck underbodies. G.M. and Ford also worry that the government might require higher fuel economy; the automakers helped narrowly defeat such a plan in Congress two months ago.</p>
        <p>But another big reason for G.M.'s declaration seemed to be a nervousness that last week's news conference by Ford had burnished Ford's  reputation for environmental responsibility, which might help Ford sell more vehicles. ''What annoys me is the perception that seems to come from that press conference that Ford is somehow the environmental leader,'' Mr. Pearce said.</p>
        <p>Jacques A. Nasser, Ford's chief executive, said last week that the planned improvement in fuel economy would save the typical sport utility customer about 1,700 gallons of gasoline, or 80 trips to the gas station, over the first 10 years of vehicle ownership. The effect on the nation's overall oil imports and emissions of global warming gases, while  small at first, would grow as the more efficient models gradually replace the behemoths now on the road.</p>
        <p>DaimlerChrysler and Asian automakers declined to join Ford and G.M. in promising fuel-economy gains, saying that they already had better gas mileage, partly because they did not sell models as big as the Ford Excursion and the G.M. Chevrolet Suburban. ''We'll let them do the tit for tat,'' said Michael Aberlich, a DaimlerChrysler spokesman.</p>
        <p>Michael Love, Toyota's national regulatory affairs manager, said the Japanese automaker would focus on the gas mileage of individual models. ''We'll try to have class-leading fuel economy in every segment we're in,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists hailed G.M.'s position. ''That's huge -- Ford placed its bet and G.M. anted up and we've got a real race here,'' said Jason Mark, the transportation co-director at the Union of Concerned Scientists.</p>
        <p>Like Ford last week, G.M. said today that it would improve fuel economy without resorting to the auto industry's favorite loopholes in the 1990's: building vehicles so heavy that they are exempt from federal fuel-economy rules, and claiming gas mileage credits for vehicles that have the capability to burn either gasoline or nearly pure ethanol, even though ethanol is not available in most of the country. G.M. also said that, like Ford, it would achieve almost all of its improvement through changes in conventional gasoline-powered engines, rather than by switching to potentially dirty diesel engines or introducing partly electric engines for which consumer demand is unclear.</p>
        <p>G.M. provided more technical details than Ford, saying it planned to change all of its big V-8 engines over the next several years to use a technology tried in desperation and abandoned during the depths of the oil crisis that followed the Iranian revolution in 1979. The technology involves turning off four of the engine's eight cylinders except when maximum power is needed for acceleration or towing.</p>
        <p>This approach was discredited when G.M. tried it in the early 1980's because the engine controls then were slow to sense changes in the driver's need for power, so there was a long lag when drivers tried to accelerate. The latest microprocessors adjust the number of cylinders in use faster than a human being can appreciate the change, said Stephen G. Poulos, a G.M. engineer.</p>
        <p>G.M. also said it would introduce in some of its light trucks a technology known as a continuously variable transmission. This replaces a conventional four-speed automatic transmission, and is in use on a few very small cars, mainly overseas. But the technology, which allows gear changes that are undetectable to drivers, has been improving lately for use on larger vehicles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pearce also displayed a large pickup truck and a city bus that were each powered by a hybrid system of a gasoline engine and an electric motor. The hybrid pickup truck will be 15 percent more fuel efficient than current models and the hybrid bus will be 50 percent more efficient. Many electric vehicle enthusiasts say that even bigger efficiency gains will be possible, and that hybrid systems could someday reduce considerably the nation's energy needs.</p>
        <p>But G.M. is concerned that customers may take a while to accept hybrids as household vehicles, and is not counting on hybrids to play more than a very small part in its overall improvement in light truck fuel economy by 2005, said Jeffrey Kuhlman, a G.M. spokesman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pearce said G.M.'s current sport utilities go 6 percent farther than Ford's on a gallon of gasoline, on average. He did not promise that G.M. would beat Ford by a similar percentage in 2005, raising the possibility that G.M. could keep the lead but improve its fuel economy by a little less than Ford's 25 percent.</p>
        <p>Ford officials said they were unsure whether G.M.'s current sport utilities were ahead in fuel economy. In midmodel year reports to regulators on the 2000 model year, G.M. and Ford have both reported that their light truck fleets are averaging 20.9 miles a gallon.</p>
        <p>But Ford welcomed G.M.'s overall willingness to compete on fuel economy. ''It's good for the ecology; it's good for the customer,'' said Ken Zino, a Ford spokesman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pearce, who has overseen public policy and technology issues at G.M. for four years, mentioned repeatedly today his irritation at the attention that Ford had received for its commitment to greater fuel economy at a news conference in Washington last week. He chided Mr. Nasser, Ford's chief executive, for having flown to Washington to make his announcement at the National Press Club. ''We've got them beat in S.U.V.'s and they know it, and maybe that's why they felt compelled to be in the Press Club,'' he said, speaking at G.M.'s Truck Design Center here.</p>
