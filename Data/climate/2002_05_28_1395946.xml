        <p>President George W. Bush appeared to be yearning for his bed after arriving at the villa of the American ambassador to Italy, shortly after 10:30 tonight. After six stops in five days, including two rather late nights with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who could blame him?</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush is clearly a very tired man. His staff says so. He admitted to jet lag at a news conference at Élysée Palace on Sunday, just after asking to be reminded of the elements of a multipart question he had been asked moments before. ''That's what happens when you are over 55,'' he said to his host, Jacques Chirac, who is pushing 70 and arched his eyebrows at the explanation.</p>
        <p>It wasn't the only moment Mr. Bush seemed in serious need of caffeine, or Ronald Reagan's more leisurely approach to foreign travel. Instead, he moves between countries the way his father did -- aerobic travel, like the family sport of aerobic golf. But the pace is taking an obvious toll, even on a fit baby-boomer president who keeps a treadmill on Air Force One.</p>
        <p>Equally exhausted reporters following Mr. Bush on his whirlwind European tour, many of whom are younger than 55, were quick to recognize the embarrassing signs of this experiment in sleep deprivation.</p>
        <p>At the hour when Mr. Bush might prefer to be packing it in, Europeans are just thinking about dinner. And when in Rome -- or Berlin, or Moscow, or St. Petersburg -- you eat when the local leaders do.</p>
        <p>He was out until 11 p.m. the first night, sipping coffee in a Berlin café. On Friday night, it was dinner at the Putins' until 12:30 a.m. The next night he was out late at the ballet and on a cruise in St. Petersburg, getting home just before midnight.</p>
        <p>An aide who has been with him for much of the trip conceded, ''He's dragging a bit by the end of these intense days.'' And Mr. Bush is far more prone to rhetorical missteps when he's droopy.</p>
        <p>In Germany, at a news conference with Prime Minister Gerhard Schröder, he talked of the West's obligation ''to help Russia securitize the dismantling -- the dismantled nuclear warheads.'' That comment prompted one of Mr. Bush's foreign policy aides to crack that ''We'd be happy to have the stuff locked up -- we don't really expect anyone to buy shares in it.''</p>
        <p>In Moscow, he had no apologies to Thomas Jefferson when he told religious leaders that, ''we hold dear what our Declaration of Independence says, that all have got uninalienable rights, endowed by a Creator.''</p>
        <p>In St. Petersburg, though, Mr. Bush seemed to have a pretty good comeback when a student asked if he were worried about the brain-drain from Russia to the West. ''It's going to take a lot of brains in Russia to create a drain,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Punching Bag for Politics</p>
        <p>Anyone wondering why Mr. Bush was greeted so warmly in Russia, yet took zingers about the environment, farm policy, steel, and American unilateralism from other European leaders, should consider this: Russia may be a new democracy, but Mr. Putin is a long way from an election.</p>
        <p>Not true for Mr. Schröder, who faces a tough fight in September and could not afford, his advisers say, to seem too cozy with a president who is regularly berated in the German press. ''Schröder had to show a little independence from the president,'' a German diplomat said. ''You know -- we're happy to finally have you here, but don't get too close.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chirac, facing some parliamentary elections in two weeks, pointed out that the United States consumes too much of the world's energy. In case Mr. Bush missed it the first time, on Sunday, Mr. Chirac repeated it at Normandy today. And on Sunday he needled the president a bit for signing a farm bill that subsidizes American farmers while American negotiators are telling Europe to let their farmers discover the workings of the free market.</p>
        <p>Then there is Mr. Putin, who is trying to turn a weak hand into some cold cash. Once an opponent of missile defenses, he now wants a piece of the contracts to build the system's interceptors. Once interested in an alliance with China against American power, he is now interested jumping aboard the unilateralist bandwagon.</p>
        <p>At St. Petersburg State University, Mr. Putin's alma mater, not a single student berated Mr. Putin's guest over the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, steel tariffs or Iraq. Instead, they asked what made him a good manager.</p>
        <p>Tongues, Twisted</p>
        <p>A lesson for correspondents covering Mr. Bush: When abroad, stick to English in the president's presence.</p>
        <p>Offenders might otherwise find themselves in the situation David Gregory, an NBC News White House correspondent, who appeared to raise Mr. Bush's ire Sunday afternoon at Élysée Palace when he asked a rather in-your-face question to a tired president, then broke into French to seek Mr. Chirac's opinion.</p>
        <p>''I wonder why it is you think there are such strong sentiments in Europe against you and against this administration?'' Mr. Gregory asked Mr. Bush in English, ''Why, particularly, there's a view that you and your administration are trying to impose America's will on the rest of the world, particularly when it comes to the Middle East and where the war on terrorism goes next?'' Turning to Mr. Chirac, Mr. Gregory broke into French and asked him to comment on the same question.</p>
        <p>Perhaps Mr. Bush thought the French question was directed at him, or perhaps he thought Mr. Gregory was showing off. Whatever the case, Mr. Bush, his voice dripping with sarcasm, said ''Very good, the guy memorizes four words, and he plays like he's intercontinental.'' (Mr. Gregory offered to go on in French, but that only made things worse.)</p>
        <p>''I'm impressed -- que bueno,'' said Mr. Bush, using the Spanish phrase for ''how wonderful.'' He added: ''Now I'm literate in two languages.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gregory seemed a bit abashed, but others noted that, during the trip, Russian, German and French reporters posed questions to Mr. Bush in English, and in their native tongue to other leaders.</p>
