        <p>IT was Philibert Commerson, a naturalist on the voyage of the French explorer Louis Antoine de Bougainville, who first labeled the mountainous island of Tahiti ''utopia.'' That was in 1768, and in the two and a half centuries since, sailors from Fletcher Christian to James Cook, writers from Robert Louis Stevenson to Jack London, painters like Gauguin, and tourists by the tens of thousands have followed, all seeking the same: Heaven on Earth.</p>
        <p>Today it's no secret that Tahiti has become largely a beautiful stopping-off point on the way to more remote French Polynesian islands. This was confirmed for me recently on a hillside overlooking Tahiti's Bounty Bay, during a long afternoon spent with Jamie Hall, grandson of James Norman Hall, who with Charles Nordhoff wrote a handful of books including ''Mutiny on the Bounty'' and ''Men Against the Sea,'' set in and around his adopted Tahitian paradise.</p>
        <p>''If he could see Tahiti today, he'd turn around and go straight back to heaven,'' said his grandson, Mr. Hall. ''Too many people, too much noise and too much pollution. Where might he go instead? To the outer islands, the Tuamotus. If there is a paradise today, that's where you will find it.''</p>
        <p>His grandfather and I would have gotten along just fine. I've been in the Tuamotus several times, most notably on an expedition in 2002 that took me the length of the 1,000-mile-long chain by sea kayak, fishing boat and cargo ship. Last spring I spent a few more weeks there, traveling by small plane and big ship. On the latter trip, I was acutely aware that these paradisical islands are threatened by both loss of culture and the planet's changing climate.</p>
        <p>The remote chain of 77 coral reef atolls and one rocky island lies halfway between Australia and South America. It was nicknamed ''the Dangerous Archipelago'' by Bougainville, thanks to the shallow, sharp reefs that surround the atolls. Magellan was the first Westerner to map the chain, spying its northeasternmost member, Pukapuka, in 1521; 300 years later when the atolls finally succumbed to the French Protectorate, there were still a handful of cannibals living about. Life since has been mostly peaceful, but for France's testing its nuclear weapons on the atolls of Muroroa and Fangataufa. That ended in 1996. Today, thanks to a booming black pearl industry, many of the inhabited Tuamotu atolls now have growing populations and airstrips. The atolls nearest Tahiti -- Tikehau, Manihi, Fakarava, Rangiroa -- rate among the best dive spots on the planet and boast both luxury hotels and simple pensions. Fakarava is an easy two-hour flight from Tahiti. Black-pearl money has recently helped pave the atoll's main street. The best pain au chocolat in the South Pacific can be bought along the same main drag, from a boulang√®re just next to a church elegantly decorated with chandeliers made from conch shells.</p>
        <p>I stayed in a simple pension called Chez Matilde, with cabins to rent on the beach; a fancier hotel -- the Fakarava Dream -- has opened a few miles down the beach, with a couple of dozen luxury cabanas.</p>
        <p>My preference though is to sleep on the beach, which is easily done in the Tuamotus, on any of a number of motus -- mini-islands made of sand washed up on the rim of the coral reef. If you are after a glimpse of paradise, sleeping in these sands offers as close to a utopian experience as possible. On Fakarava I chose a motu named Kiria on the far side of the lagoon from town. I hired a boat to drop me and made camp next to a hoa -- a tidal stream running in from the sea -- hanging a hammock between two coconut palms. In the mornings I would watch a squadron of frigate birds hover above the palms, floating on thermals. Beneath the hammock an army of sand crabs went about their various duties, leaving long, thin trails in the otherwise unadulterated sand. Gently pounding surf, broken by the thin coral reef crest, created a shallow aqua-blue swimming hole.</p>
        <p>I spent my days walking my mini-island, contemplating the notion -- as outsiders have done for two millenniums -- whether these most-isolated little islands in the heart of the Pacific Ocean are in fact Heaven on Earth.</p>
        <p>An hour's flight west, Rangiroa is the largest of the Tuamotu atolls, its lagoon 40 miles by 20 miles. At its far western end is the Blue Lagoon, a shallow, mini-lagoon with arguably the bluest waters in the South Pacific and access to a kind of marine life that is hard to ignore in this part of the world: Sharks. Lots of sharks.</p>
        <p>The best way to observe sharks, of course, is to dive with them. The two natural passes on Rangiroa -- Tiputa and Avatoru -- offer some of the best drift diving in the world. Dropped off on the ocean side, you dive deep right away, to 100 feet, into the fast-moving current. In order to stay in place, and not get sucked right away through the pass, fingertips grasp for coral outcroppings -- any little nub will do in the four-to-five-knot current. If you can manage to hold on, to stay in one place for even a few seconds, a watery dreamscape lies on the other side of your mask: giant napoleon wrasses, hawksbill turtles, manta and eagle rays, angelfish, banner fish, parrotfish, pink soft anemones; schools of snappers, trevallies, surgeonfish, unicornfish, groupers, soldierfish. Dolphins plunge deep beneath the surface, then rocket out of sight.</p>
        <p>Arms clasped to chest, fins gently treading, trying to breathe slowly, I looked out into the deepest blue I've ever seen; the trench drops off several thousand feet, down to 10,000 feet. Deep in the blue spectacle unfolds a whole other world. Call it Shark City. Gray reefs, lemons, a hammerhead or two, and dozens of black tips, too many to count.</p>
        <p>As I let let loose of my fingerhold, the ocean world began to move past in a dizzying hurry as I was sucked, pleasantly, by a racing current through the underwater pass toward the lagoon. The biggest danger is being caught inside a mascaret, a phenomenon produced when the swell or wind is traveling in the opposite direction as the current. The accompanying turbulence creates whirlpools and the sea fills with particulate, making it difficult to see, easy to get lost. Being thrown against sharp rock pinnacles jutting out from the valley side is another worry. I was nearly hallucinating on the rush of marine life skidding by like some kind of 12-lane traffic accident passing in slow motion, when the dive master unfurled the orange banner signaling the pickup boat above.</p>
        <p>Back on the surface, I was reminded of the irony in all this surrounding beauty. There is a strong possibility the Tuamotus will not be easy to inhabit, much less visit, in the century to come. These living, breathing, still-growing reefs -- and the lagoons they protect -- will very likely disappear in the next 50 to 100 years, thanks to their inability to keep pace with a warming ocean.</p>
        <p>International climate change experts recently warned that global warming could cause seas to rise worldwide by up to two feet this century, but marine biologists in French Polynesia think that there it could be four feet. The potential for disaster is clear and present in a place where human populations -- as few as 5 (Tauere) and as many as 2,500 (Rangiroa) -- live just a few feet above sea level. A bigger concern is that warm seas bring more violent and frequent storms, which threaten to end life as it is today on these fragile rubble heaps.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the nastiest storm in the Tuamotus was in 1906, following the San Francisco earthquake that set off a tidal wave that surged across the Pacific to wipe out dozens of island populations. Jack London sailed his Snark through the Tuamotus in 1910, and his story ''House of Mapuhi'' describes a hurricane on Hikeru that killed hundreds, as palm trees heavy with escapees from the storm broke off and sent them to drown in the heaving sea. The last hurricane to blow through Rangiroa, in 1983, flooded its two villages, sending people scampering up the airport towers for escape. Locals tie their boats to trees and try to ride out big storms, lashing plastic coolers around the bases of palm trees and placing infant children inside, as seas rise to a man's shoulders.</p>
        <p>This potential coming calamity is mostly lost on locals. In Avatoru a school bus driver and amateur javelin-thrower was building a new home just 45 feet from the lagoon edge. Cement pylons supported heavy I-beams raised three feet above the ground, allowing for rising seas to -- he hopes -- race beneath his new home.</p>
        <p>When I asked him about the weather, he responded in perfect Polynesian form: ''Today was not very good.'' What about tomorrow? No reply. It's a beauty of the Polynesian lifestyle, like that of many island people around the globe, that they don't look much beyond right now. The future is too far off.</p>
        <p>''Global warming?'' the bus driver pondered, scratching his head. ''No, don't know what that is, never heard of it.'' The reality is that if tropical storms and hurricanes increase as is predicted, things here will change very quickly.</p>
        <p>I stopped off in Manihi and Tikehau, small atolls closest to Tahiti and easily reached by daily flights. Manihi is the chain's black pearl capital, with more than 60 farms. Only one hotel -- the Pearl Beach Resort -- has been there for 30 years, and I spent a couple of nights in a comfortable beachside bungalow. While the lagoon is picture-perfect -- right down to the abandoned shacks on stilts in its center that used to house pearl farms -- and the snorkeling just outside its sole pass is the most beautiful I've done in the South Pacific, there is something slightly industrial about the atoll, thanks to all the pearl farms lining the reef crest. At Tikehau I stayed in a sister Pearl Beach resort, this one just five years old. It is the complete opposite of a hammock-in-paradise experience -- an over-water cabin, replete with metal ladder allowing direct access to and from the sea.</p>
        <p>For me, the highlight of Tikehau's lagoon is reached by motorboat. Motu Puarua -- Bird Island -- lives up to its name. We anchored the boat in the coral and circumnavigated the tiny lump of coral and sand by foot on a hot, hot day. Everywhere -- everywhere -- are nesting birds, just at head height. Thousands of birds -- boobies, noddies and terns -- were curious by our presence and flew circles above our heads, squawking. Then they got used to us, and continued their business of feeding chicks and making nests. In the center of the mini-island, under short palm trees, a pair of white terns cleaned each other, all the while carrying on some kind of elaborate conversation.</p>
        <p>Under blue sky, with matching seas surrounding and not a human soul for 10 miles, the question once again arose: Might this be Paradise? It is probably as close as a Western imagination gets.</p>
        <p>And I felt very, very lucky to see it before it changes -- forever.</p>
        <p>ATOLLS AND LAGOONS, BIRDS AND SHARKS</p>
        <p>BEFORE YOU GO</p>
        <p>United States citizens get an automatic 30-day visa for travel to the Tuamotus. An onward-bound ticket is necessary for everyone arriving except European Union citizens. Flights from Kennedy Airport to Papeete, Tahiti, are available several times a week; the fare is around $1,500 on Air Tahiti Nui (www.airtahitinui-usa.com).</p>
        <p>GETTING AROUND</p>
        <p>Rangiroa has two towns; Tiputa is reached only by boat taxi. Dive shops, a regional school, hotels and pensions are near Avatoru, close to the airport. The paved road on Tikehau is just six miles long -- five miles on Manihi -- so there's not much need to rent a car. Most of the hotels rent bicycles. If you want to explore the lagoons, it's easy enough to hitch a ride with a fisherman or pearl farmers.</p>
        <p>To get to Tikehau, Air Tahiti (689-96-22-66; www.airtahiti.aero) flies 10 times a week from Papeete. Manihi can be reached by air from Papeete via Ahe, Rangiroa or Bora Bora. Inter-island flights run between $300 and $400.</p>
        <p>HOTELS</p>
        <p>On Rangiroa, the Kia Ora Village Hotel is made up of 60 small cabins and is at the high end (689-93-11-11; www.hotelkiaora.com; rates begin at 32,000 French Pacific francs, about $360 at 97 Pacific francs to the U.S. dollar). Its sister is the Kia Ora Sauvage, a group of small cabanas on the far side of the lagoon, reached by boat. I stayed at Chez Glorine, next to the wharf at the far end of Avatoru (689-96-04-05; 7,500 Pacific francs). On Fakarava, the new Fakarava Dream (689-98-43-00; www.hotelmaitai.com/fakarava) is all elegance, with rooms starting at 38,200 Pacific francs.</p>
        <p>There are luxury Pearl Beach Resorts on Tikehau and Manihi (689-50-84-52; www.pearlresorts.com). The Tikehau Pearl Beach Resort is the newer and fancier one, with 30 over-water bungalows from 38,000 Pacific francs. Also on Tikehau is the Tikehau Village (689-96-22-86; from 17,000 Pacific francs). The Manihi Pearl Beach Resort, the oldest in the chain, is closed for renovations, but should reopen next month.</p>
        <p>SIGHTS AND ACTIVITIES</p>
        <p>Some of the best scuba diving in the world is on Rangiroa and Fakarava. I dove with Six Passengers on Rangiroa (689-96-02-60, www.the6passengers.com), and Te Ava Nui (689-98-42-50; www.tuamotu.plongee.free.fr) took me to the spectacular Garuae Pass.</p>
        <p>Scuba diving on Tikehau can be arranged through Rangiroa's Raie Manta Club (689-96-02-16; www.raiemantaclub.free.fr). Lagoon excursions to Motu Puarua, the bird island, can be arranged through the Pearl Beach Resort.</p>
        <p>Scuba diving can be arranged with Manihi Blue Nui (689-96-42-17; www.bluenui.com).</p>
