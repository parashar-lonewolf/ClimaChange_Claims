        <p>After years of pursuing legal action against Midwestern and Southern power plants for their emissions, New York State has settled a pollution case in its own backyard.</p>
        <p>The attorney general's office and the State Department of Environmental Conservation announced yesterday that the current and former owners of the Lovett coal-fired power plant in Stony Point, in northern Rockland County, had agreed to improve pollution controls substantially over the next five years.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, the former owner of the plant, Orange and Rockland Utilities, has agreed to pay a $600,000 fine and to spend $800,000 on conservation and clean-energy projects.</p>
        <p>The current owner, Mirant New York, agreed to install $1 million worth of new equipment that is expected to cut nitrogen oxide emissions by at least 75 percent and reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by at least 40 percent.</p>
        <p>In the spring of 2000, the Department of Environmental Conservation charged that the companies were violating the federal Clean Air Act, which requires power plants to install up-to-date technology to reduce harmful pollutants whenever major modifications are made.</p>
        <p>The state asserted that changes made under Orange and Rockland's ownership constituted major modifications, not routine maintenance.</p>
        <p>Even though Mirant did not own the plant at the time the modifications were made, the company is still responsible for upgrading the anti-pollution technology, the state attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, said.</p>
        <p>''We have always maintained that we would be just as aggressive in enforcing in-state utilities,'' Mr. Spitzer said.</p>
        <p>A Mirant spokesman, Louis F. Friscoe, said that the company admitted no wrongdoing and believed the plant had been operated in accordance with the law, but had decided to settle anyway. ''The other option we had was to tie up all our resources fighting this in court,'' Mr. Friscoe said. ''This way we can better plan for the life of that facility.''</p>
        <p>In April, New York claimed victory in the largest settlement ever reached under the Clean Air Act when a Virginia power company agreed to spend $1.2 billion to install pollution-reducing technology in eight coal-burning plants in Virginia and West Virginia. In that case, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, which are downwind from many plants in the South, argued that the company had made extensive modifications to the plants without installing the new pollution controls.</p>
        <p>According to the attorney general's office, the 350-megawatt Lovett plant releases 9,890 tons of sulfur dioxide and 4,256 tons of nitrogen oxide a year, emissions linked to acid rain and smog. That represents 24.5 percent of the sulfur dioxide and 30.5 percent of the nitrogen oxide from electric generators in seven counties in the Hudson Valley, said Mike Fraser, a spokesman for the Department of Environmental Conservation.</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 13, 2003, Friday  An article yesterday about New York State's settlement of a pollution case against the past and current owners of a coal-fired power plant in Stony Point, N.Y., misstated the amount to be spent by the current owner, Mirant New York, to reduce emissions. It is about $100 million, not $1 million.</p>
