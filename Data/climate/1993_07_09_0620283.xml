        <p>The Rise and Fall of the House of Windsor</p>
        <p>By A. N. Wilson</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 211 pages. W. W. Norton &amp; Company. $22.  The Tarnished Crown</p>
        <p>Diana and the House of Windsor</p>
        <p>By Anthony Holden</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 401 pages. Random House. $23.</p>
        <p>These two new books on the House of Windsor and the crisis of the British monarchy agree on practically nothing.</p>
        <p>For the novelist and biographer A. N. Wilson, "there are few finer spectacles in the world" than "the Queen in her robes of State processing through the House of Lords at Westminster to open Parliament." For Anthony Holden, a longtime royal watcher, the monarchy is a ridiculously expensive exercise in folderol, which left unreformed would "consign 21st-century Britain to the realms of Ruritania."</p>
        <p>To Mr. Wilson, Queen Elizabeth II is the very model of the modern monarch: she has performed her role "so flawlessly that anyone who comes after her will seem second-rate." To Mr. Holden, the Queen is "the world's richest woman," who has lived for years "at public expense, tax free."</p>
        <p>To Mr. Wilson, Diana, the Princess of Wales, is "a creature of the media," who is surrounded by "ludicrous friends" and who has demonstrated "disloyalty to the royal family," a "hysterical nature" and "indiscretion with journalists." To Mr. Holden, the former Lady Diana Spencer is "the people's Princess," who has pioneered a pared-down, populist-style monarchy that "may yet prove the House of Windsor's only hope of salvation."</p>
        <p>One thing Mr. Holden and Mr. Wilson do agree on is that Prince Charles is a twit. Mr. Wilson, who once described the Prince of Wales as "a diminutive bore with protuberant ears," writes here that he "does not merely contribute to the difficulties of the royal house, he is the difficulty." Mr. Holden, on his part, describes Prince Charles as "a puerile, bawdy, hot-blooded adulterer" who "was in the habit of talking to his plants."</p>
        <p>The other thing the authors agree on is that Prince Charles's highly publicized marital difficulties do not simply provide fodder for the tabloid press; they also have serious implications for the future of the British monarchy.</p>
        <p>Queen Elizabeth herself acknowledged the royal family's plight when she described 1992 as an "annus horribilis." This was the year that witnessed the separation of Prince Andrew and Sarah, the Duke and Duchess of York; Princess Anne's divorce from Capt. Mark Phillips; the newspaper publication of extracts from Andrew Morton's hotly debated book, "Diana: Her True Story," and the fire at Windsor Castle, which led to a furor about the Queen's exemption from the tax code.</p>
        <p>The advent of 1993 would do nothing to alleviate the royal family's miseries: in January, the press published transcripts of an intimate, sexually explicit telephone conversation between two lovers, widely identified as Prince Charles and his longtime friend Camilla Parker-Bowles. The famous "Camillagate," Mr. Holden writes, "dragged the crown as deep into the mud as at any time in the 500 years since Henry VII found it there at Bosworth Field."</p>
        <p>As both Mr. Holden and Mr. Wilson make clear, these recent developments have raised serious questions about the House of Windsor's ability to fulfill the traditional functions of constitutional kingship. In the first place, Mr. Holden argues, the collapse of the younger royals' marriages has deprived the royal family of its role as "a paradigm of Christian family life."</p>
        <p>The crown's religious function, embodied in the sovereign's role as Supreme Governor of the National Church, has also been called into question. Advocates of disestablishment (separation of the church, crown and state) have long been arguing that the Church of England represents a dwindling fraction of the British population, and their calls for the end of its special status have gained momentum with the prospect of Prince Charles's ascent to the throne. Divorce, after all, looms large as a possibility for the Prince and Princess of Wales, and it would be hard for Prince Charles to become Supreme Governor of a Church that still forbids divorce.</p>
        <p>As for the constitutional role of the crown (in the words of the scholar Walter Bagehot, "to be consulted, to encourage and occasionally to warn") it, too, appears to have been threatened by what Mr. Wilson describes as Prince Charles's taste for "the headline-grabbing potential of adopting 'controversial' attitudes." His decision to give a speech that compromised Britain's position in the embattled General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks, his moralistic homilies on everything from medicine to architecture to the ozone layer, and his petulant attack on the writer Salman Rushdie, all indicate, Mr. Holden writes, the Prince's "dogged determination to wander way out of his depth."</p>
        <p>Neither Mr. Holden nor Mr. Wilson aspires to give the reader a wholly objective view of the royal family: Mr. Holden, who is billed on the cover of "The Tarnished Crown" as "Lady Di's friend," makes no secret of his loyalties to the Princess, while Mr. Wilson seasons the text of "The Rise and Fall of the House of Windsor" with cranky, idiosyncratic asides that reveal his royalist sympathies and his impatience with "filthy, chaotic, idle, rancorous modern Britain."</p>
        <p>Although both authors agree that the Prince of Wales should not succeed his mother on the throne, they present widely divergent suggestions for remedying the crisis of the crown. An impassioned supporter of the monarchy, Mr. Wilson proposes installing Richard, Duke of Gloucester, as King. The Duke, Mr. Wilson asserts, not only has historical claims to the throne (his father was the fourth child of George V and Queen Mary), but is a "decent, quiet sort" who might restore a measure of dignity to the throne as well.</p>
        <p>Mr. Holden's argument sounds considerably less eccentric. If the House of Windsor wants to avoid being replaced by an elected president, he suggests, it must rapidly take steps toward reform to insure that the monarchy is "a relevant, contemporary force for good in the modern world, rather than an antique, outmoded repository of hereditary wealth and privilege." He adds: "As long as its denizens live in extravagant luxury at public expense, hoarding their huge private wealth -- and failing, in some cases, to maintain the high moral standards, which are the price of such privilege -- the monarchy's chances of survival sink daily."</p>
