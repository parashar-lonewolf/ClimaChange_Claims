        <p>U.S. Bans European Meat, Fearing Spread of Virus  The United States banned imports of animals and animal products from the European Union after learning that foot-and-mouth disease had spread to France from Britain. The Agriculture Department said it was taking the precaution to protect the domestic industry from a possible outbreak of the virus, which poses no danger to people but is devastating to cloven-hoofed animals.</p>

        <p>Western Europe has chosen to deal with the virus largely by slaughtering and cremating infected animals rather than by inoculating them.</p>

        <p>Pilot Had Approval to Bomb  Pentagon officials said an air controller on the ground at a Kuwaiti bombing range had cleared the pilot of a Navy fighter to release his three 500-pound bombs, which landed in the wrong area and killed six people. The officials said that seconds after issuing the clearance the controller realized the plane was aiming at the wrong target and tried to stop it.</p>

        <p>Israel Loosens Roadblocks  Israel eased a tight blockade of Ramallah by opening two roads on the West Bank and allowing some Palestinians access to them after thorough security checks. Palestinian officials said the change was superficial.</p>

        <p>Syria May Gain Council Seat  Syria appears likely to be elected to a rotating Security Council seat this year after gaining the backing of a majority of Middle Eastern and Asian nations and several important European governments, diplomats said.</p>

        <p>North Korea Puts Off Talks  North Korea postponed meetings planned for this week between North and South Korean cabinet members on inter-Korean relations. There was speculation that the North's leader, Kim Jong Il, was unhappy about recent comments by President Bush after a meeting with President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea.</p>

        <p>Approval of Bush at 60%, Despite Some Misgivings  President Bush's job approval rating is 60 percent, although half the public believes he is not really in charge of what is going on in his administration, a New York Times/CBS News Poll found. And while more than half of all Americans accept Mr. Bush as the legitimate president, three-quarters of black Americans do not, an aftereffect of the Florida recount.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Reversal on Gas Emissions  President Bush, under pressure from conservative Republicans and industry groups, reversed a campaign pledge and said his administration would not seek to regulate emissions of carbon dioxide, which has been linked to global warming.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Vote on Medicare Revenue  The Senate blocked an effort by Democrats to restrict Congressional use of surplus Medicare revenue for a tax cut or general government spending. Republicans said the measure would not have had any practical effect, in part because the budget could be made to add up without using Medicare revenue for any purposes outside of Medicare.</p>
        <p>A16</p>
        <p>Effort to Ease Air Delays  Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta said he favored charging airlines more for flights at busy airports during peak hours to spread out traffic and cut delays, though that might make fewer seats available when most customers wanted to fly.</p>
        <p>A16</p>
        <p>Pardon Inquiry Centralized  Attorney General John Ashcroft has decided to refer all accusations of criminal wrongdoing related to President Bill Clinton's final pardons to the United States attorney in New York, Mary Jo White.</p>

        <p>Terrorism Trial Opens  Federal prosecutors in Los Angeles began their case against an Algerian man, Ahmed Ressam, 33, who is accused of transporting bomb-making equipment into the United States from Canada in the trunk of a rented car 15 months ago.</p>

        <p>Fewer Big Signs Reflect Cooler Economic Times  The economic slowdown is pinching advertising budgets, cooling the billboard frenzy that swept New York City over the last four years. One company with nearly 60 signs in Times Square said prices for some billboards were down 25 percent.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Nassau Leader Won't Run  Thomas S. Gulotta, the Nassau County executive since 1987, said he would not seek re-election. Mr. Gulotta, tarnished by the county fiscal crisis, is lagging in opinion polls and has been abandoned by fellow Republicans.</p>

        <p>Egan Lobbies in Albany  Cardinal Edward M. Egan used his first visit to the state capital to seek support for the Roman Catholic Church's position on insurance coverage for birth control, financing for parochial schools and other issues.</p>
