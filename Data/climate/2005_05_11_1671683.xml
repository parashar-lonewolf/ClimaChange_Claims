        <p>A ski resort in central Andermatt has wrapped part of the shrinking Gurschen glacier in a layer of reflective foil to protect it from melting. The cover, which is made of synthetic fibers, cost $83,000 and covers as much as 4,000 square yards, will protect natural access to the runs on the glacier. Urs Elmiger, a board member of the ski lift company behind the project, told Reuters that the retreat of Alpine glaciers due to global warming meant it would become ''common practice to cover parts of the glaciers.''</p>
