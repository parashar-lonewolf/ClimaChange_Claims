        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>While I enjoyed your fascinating supplement on the climate conference in Kyoto, Japan (Global Warming, special section, Dec. 1), I was disappointed by the absence of environmental education from the articles. Education should be a top priority when discussing environmental issues, but we continually ignore this preventative way of dealing with ecological problems and settle for putting out fires instead.</p>

        <p>While I enjoyed your fascinating supplement on the climate conference in Kyoto, Japan (Global Warming, special section, Dec. 1), I was disappointed by the absence of environmental education from the articles. Education should be a top priority when discussing environmental issues, but we continually ignore this preventative way of dealing with ecological problems and settle for putting out fires instead.</p>
        <p>Environmental education policy is especially significant this year as the National Environmental Education Act of 1990 is up for reauthorization in Congress. If it is given the same amount of public discussion as the talks in Kyoto, the law may help to prevent the environmental firefighting that has become so common in recent years.</p>
