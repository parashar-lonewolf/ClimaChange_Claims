        <p>The Sierra Club, one of the nation's largest and most influential environmental groups, will endorse Vice President Al Gore today at a news conference where its president, Robert Cox, will declare that Mr. Gore would be ''the most pro-environment'' president in modern history if elected.</p>
        <p>Debbie Sease, the Sierra Club's legislative director, said 12 of the group's 15 board members voted to endorse Mr. Gore on Saturday. Only one member wanted to endorse Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate. Among those voting for Mr. Gore was Michael Dorsey, a college professor from Michigan who wrote a memorandum sharply criticizing Mr. Gore last year.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sease said the board members supported Mr. Gore not only because of his strong environmental record, but also because they viewed his Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush, as a real threat to clean air and water.</p>
        <p>''Bush has made it very clear that he plans to undo and undercut and weaken the very provisions that have given us the environmental progress we have had in the last several decades,'' Ms. Sease said.</p>
        <p>The Sierra Club has already run television advertisements criticizing Mr. Bush in select states. Now, with its endorsement, the organization will also try to mobilize its 600,000 members to work toward Mr. Gore's election.</p>
        <p>Another major environmental group, the League of Conservation Voters, has also endorsed Mr. Gore. The only other national environmental group that endorses presidential candidates, Friends of the Earth, the smallest of the three, is still weighing whether to support Mr. Gore or Mr. Nader.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Gore wrote a book on global warming titled ''Earth in the Balance,'' he has been sharply criticized by some environmentalists, particularly for his strong support of global trade.</p>
