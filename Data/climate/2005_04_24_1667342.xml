        <p>WHEN Sydney Pollack shot his new thriller ''The Interpreter'' on location at the United Nations, he did not do so on the fourth floor of 800 Second Avenue. That is hardly a surprise. The place is not accustomed to the limelight.</p>
        <p>The fourth floor of No. 800, a sturdy office building that is protected by concrete flower boxes and sits on the corner of 42nd Street, represents a rare pocket of international office-sharing in the ostentatious world of diplomatic missions.

        <p>WHEN Sydney Pollack shot his new thriller ''The Interpreter'' on location at the United Nations, he did not do so on the fourth floor of 800 Second Avenue. That is hardly a surprise. The place is not accustomed to the limelight.</p>
        <p>The fourth floor of No. 800, a sturdy office building that is protected by concrete flower boxes and sits on the corner of 42nd Street, represents a rare pocket of international office-sharing in the ostentatious world of diplomatic missions. Known formally as the Joint Office for Commonwealth Permanent Missions to the United Nations, it is the place where Gambia might borrow the fax machine belonging to the Solomon Islands, which might be wondering whether to split a cab downtown with the Maldives.</p>
        <p>On a recent Thursday morning, a mini-crisis was brewing on the floor, but it was not of the diplomatic kind. Some of the phones were down.</p>
        <p>''We've called Verizon,'' Nadine Adjodha, secretary to the ambassador of Samoa, said to Janet Grace John, the general receptionist to the floor.</p>
        <p>Ms. John replied, ''I called St. Lucia, and their phones are dead, too.''</p>
        <p>The Joint Office, which has beige walls brightened by occasional posters from its mainly tropical inhabitants, formally came into being 20 years ago. These days, 10 nations from three regions -- the Pacific, the Caribbean and Africa -- have their U.N. missions there, and for some countries these offices serve as their embassies to the United States and Canada as well. The only nation on the floor that is not entirely made up of islands (or a SIDS, a small island developing state, in U.N. language) is Gambia.</p>
        <p>Unsurprisingly, it was their only New Yorker, a Brooklyn dentist named Lamuel Stanislaus, who was the driving force behind this solution to the rent problems of these small nations. Dr. Stanislaus, 85, served as Grenada's permanent representative to the United Nations from 1985 until his retirement last year.</p>
        <p>''As soon as I got there, I couldn't understand how you had such a number of small states operating in such an uneconomical manner,'' Dr. Stanislaus said. In the pricey precincts of Midtown, those poor countries were toughing it out on their own, paying rent on separate offices.</p>
        <p>Dr. Stanislaus first approached the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States with the idea of a shared space, but it turned him down. (This month, St. Vincent, one of the first countries Dr. Stanislaus pitched his idea to, will finally join the Joint Office. ''Now they feel the crunch,'' Dr. Stanislaus said with some satisfaction.)</p>
        <p>In the end, it was the Commonwealth, the organization of nations of the former British Empire, that agreed to the Stanislaus plan. The Commonwealth's largest donors, countries like Britain, Australia and New Zealand, would pay the rent for the shared office, while the tenants would pay other expenses. So the tenants get a break on rent as well as the efficiency of shared services.</p>
        <p>''There is nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come,'' said Dr. Stanislaus, who is writing his memoirs, which he hopes will give ''a good, good picture of dentistry and diplomacy.''</p>
        <p>On the same morning that the phones failed, most of the ambassadors agreed that cost and convenience were the main benefits of the arrangement, which allows them to share a conference room, a reception area, a library and copying machines.</p>
        <p>''It is very hard,'' said Ambassador Mohamed Latheef of the Maldives. ''No matter how small a mission is, it requires a minimum amount of facilities. When we joined up, there were a lot of savings.''</p>
        <p>Just down the hall, Ambassador Crispin Grey-Johnson of Gambia agreed. ''All of these things you would normally have to break your head worrying about, someone else deals with them,'' he said, referring to the receptionist and to Tania Laumanulupe Tupou, the floor's manager, who is from Tonga.</p>
        <p>Ambassador Ali'ioaiga Feturi Elisaia of Samoa, noting that tiny missions often shared their notes because none could attend every U.N. meeting, added, ''I can't imagine what life would be like without it.''</p>
        <p>The Joint Office is about more than shared facilities; its tenants also have shared interests. Beyond the struggle against what Mr. Grey-Johnson calls ''the problem of smallness'' -- the difficulty in having any presence in international diplomacy -- these countries jointly grapple with specific troubles.</p>
        <p>Global warming is one, with many of the states facing the prospect of losing islands and coral reefs to rising sea levels and temperatures. Securing beneficial trade treaties is another, as is the continuing struggle against natural disasters. Grenada, for instance, suffered about $1 billion of damage last September, when Hurricane Ivan destroyed 90 percent of the island's buildings. In December, both the Maldives and the Seychelles were hit by the tsunami.</p>
        <p>Banding together will not cure these troubles. But it helps. ''The moral support is there for one another,'' said Mr. Latheef of the Maldives, which lost more than 100 lives during the tsunami and suffered extensive damage to a third of its 1,191 islands. ''We are small, we cannot offer anything else.''</p>
