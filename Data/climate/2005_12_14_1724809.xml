        <p>The American ambassador, David H. Wilkins, interjected himself into the Canadian national elections on Tuesday with an implicit but strong warning to Prime Minister Paul Martin to stop attacking the United States while on the campaign trail.</p>
        <p>''I understand political expediency, but the last time I looked, the United States was not on the ballot for the Jan. 23 election,'' Mr. Wilkins said in a speech in Ottawa.

        <p>The American ambassador, David H. Wilkins, interjected himself into the Canadian national elections on Tuesday with an implicit but strong warning to Prime Minister Paul Martin to stop attacking the United States while on the campaign trail.</p>
        <p>''I understand political expediency, but the last time I looked, the United States was not on the ballot for the Jan. 23 election,'' Mr. Wilkins said in a speech in Ottawa. ''It may be smart election-year politics to thump your chest and constantly criticize your friend and your No. 1 trading partner, but it is a slippery slope.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilkins did not mention Mr. Martin by name. But it was clear that he was referring to recent statements by Mr. Martin criticizing American tariff policy on Canadian lumber, linking gang shootings in Toronto to gun smuggling from the United States and condemning the Bush administration's opposition to the Kyoto climate control protocol.</p>
        <p>At a United Nations climate change conference in Montreal last week, Mr. Martin said, ''To the reticent nations, including the United States, I say there is such a thing as a global conscience, and now is the time to listen to it.''</p>
        <p>American diplomats have often complained about Canadian criticisms, but Mr. Wilkins's remarks were perhaps the strongest since the cold war.</p>
        <p>Mr. Martin said he was not putting the United States in the campaign. ''We do expect our partners to honor their agreements,'' he said, referring to the disputed lumber tariffs. ''And I will defend Canada. Period.''</p>
