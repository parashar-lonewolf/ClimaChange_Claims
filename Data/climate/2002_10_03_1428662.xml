        <p>While the United States courts western Russia as a new source of non-OPEC oil, Japan is looking to the Russian Far East, ensuring that Sakhalin Island will become a major supplier of oil and gas to Japan within a decade.</p>
        <p>In the largest foreign direct investment in Russian history, an expected $13 billion is starting to pour into two gas and oil projects here on Sakhalin Island, a Siberian Kuwait of hydrocarbons that begins only 25 miles above Japan's northern tip.</p>
        <p>''Japan seeks to diversify its energy sources away from the Middle East,'' said Andy C. Calitz, commercial director for the Sakhalin Energy Investment Company, a multinational oil and gas group here that is led by the Royal Dutch/Shell Group. ''Japanese demand launched Alaska. Japan launched Brunei. Japan launched Australia. And Japan is going to launch Sakhalin.''</p>
        <p>In 2003, Sakhalin Energy is to start work on a 560-mile pipeline down the island to feed gas from an offshore operation to what is to be the largest liquefied natural gas plant in the world. From an ice-free terminal a few miles east of here, tankers are to start supplying, in late 2006, a dozen gas terminals around Japan, the world's largest importer of gas by ship. Sakhalin Energy, the first energy producer on the island, has been pumping and exporting oil since 1999.</p>
        <p>A group led by Exxon Mobil is developing a Sakhalin offshore section, with the goal of producing oil in about three years. The project's target of 250,000 barrels a day is the equivalent of 6 percent of Japan's daily oil imports. In 2006, Exxon Mobil plans to start building a gas pipeline to Japan, potentially a 1,000-mile, $16 billion undertaking.</p>
        <p>''The Japanese see the obvious benefit of having this enormous gas station on their border,'' said William D. Miller, executive vice president of BP Sakhalin, a BP-led group that plans to drill its first exploratory well in 2004 in a third international block. He said that based on existing information about Sakhalin's offshore oil and gas reserves, ''You can compare it to Alaska's North Slope.''</p>
        <p>With Russian companies saying they can one day supply 10 percent of American oil imports, Lukoil, the largest producer, has gone to Houston promoting a plan to build pipelines and terminals to make Russia's northwestern port of Murmansk an export outlet to the United States. Russian and American government officials and oil company executives have met at the first U.S.-Russia Commercial Energy Summit.</p>
        <p>''There could truly be a fabulous energy linkage between the United States and Russia,'' said Jeffrey Valkar, director of the American Business Center, a promotion office financed by the United States government, in the island's capital, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk.</p>
        <p>But geography and infrastructure dictate that most of Sakhalin's oil, and virtually all of its gas, will go to Asia, largely to Japan.</p>
        <p>An oil tanker can go from this port to Tokyo in three days, about one-third the time it takes to go to California. And Asia, eager to escape the $1.50 a barrel ''Asia premium'' charged by Middle East exporters, is expected to swallow up almost all of Sakhalin's oil exports in coming years. Moreover, Asia is expected to register the world's fastest growth in energy demand in this decade.</p>
        <p>As for the gas, there are no liquefied natural gas terminals on the West Coast of North America. Shipments from here are also expected to be largely consumed by Japan, a nation whose industries already pay twice as much for gas as those in Europe and nearly four times as much as those in the United States.</p>
        <p>''The price of energy in Japan is probably the highest in the world,'' Alexander N. Panov, Russia's ambassador to Japan, said in a recent news briefing in Tokyo. ''With the cheap gas from Sakhalin, there will be no reason for the high cost of energy. Otherwise, Japan's economy will lose its competitiveness.''</p>
        <p>The difference in gas prices is caused largely by pipelines. There are no international gas pipelines in Asia. Plans are being drawn up for lines linking Siberian gas deposits to China and South Korea, and for the line linking Sakhalin to Japan.</p>
        <p>With Asian countries promoting natural gas as a cleaner alternative to domestic coal or imported oil, Tatsuo Masuda, president of the Asia Pacific Energy Research Center, a regional study group financed by the Japanese government and based in Tokyo, estimated that $100 billion worth of natural gas pipelines and liquefied natural gas centers would be built in Asia in the next 15 years. To cut carbon dioxide emissions, Japan has set a goal of increasing the natural gas share of Japan's energy consumption to 20 percent in 2010 from 13 percent today. And Russia has the world's largest known natural gas reserves.</p>
        <p>For half a century, Sakhalin was as accessible to Japanese investment as the far side of the moon. In the summer of 1945, Soviet troops expelled Japanese soldiers and settlers from the island's southern half, ending four decades of Japanese occupation. To this day, there is no World War II peace treaty between Russia and Japan. Cities in the southern part of the island are dotted with monuments to Soviet heroes who fell fighting ''the samurai.''</p>
        <p>But now, with economists forecasting that Sakhalin could supply 10 percent of Japan's oil and gas imports within a decade, Japan is racing to engage its northern neighbor. Japan's newest consulate is in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. On Oct. 11, the foreign ministers of Japan and Russia are to meet in Moscow to pave the way for a visit by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to Moscow this winter.</p>
        <p>''Almost all our oil comes from the Middle East,'' said Akinari Segawa, correspondent for the new bureau here of NHK, the Japanese government television network. ''For security, we want to diversify. Japan has to take gas and oil from Sakhalin.''</p>
        <p>This summer, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk's dilapidated Soviet-era air terminal was host to a steady stream of business-suited energy company executives from Tokyo and other Asian capitals. With flights from Hokkaido and Seoul increasingly booked, All Nippon Airways is considering starting a flight next spring between Tokyo and Sakhalin.</p>
        <p>''We had visits over the summer from all our major buyers -- Japan, China, Taiwan, South Korea,'' said Chris Wilshaw, an executive in Tokyo with Sakhalin Energy's marketing office. ''It's like the opening of the North Sea, or the Gulf of Mexico.''</p>
        <p>Security of supply is often in visitors' minds, Mr. Wilshaw said. Japan, the world's largest importer of natural gas, was unnerved in 2001 when the Tokyo Electric Power Company was unable to import natural gas for six months from Aceh, Indonesia, because of separatist violence there.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilshaw declined to say if any supply contracts had been signed, saying only that he thought ''the market commitment'' was solid enough for company executives to decide in December to go ahead with $9 billion in planned investments.</p>
        <p>In addition to Shell, the Sakhalin group includes Mitsui &amp; Company and the Mitsubishi Corporation. ''This project is anchored in Japan,'' Mr. Calitz, the group's commercial director, said.</p>
        <p>With Exxon Mobil planning to build a pipeline capable of delivering 800 million cubic feet of gas a day to Japan, the company's local unit, Exxon Neftegas Project Services, opened a marketing unit in Tokyo in late August. In the production venture, Exxon Neftegas Ltd. is the operating partner of a group that includes a Japanese company, the Sakhalin Oil and Gas Development Company, two Russian companies and an Indian company. In the pipeline venture, Exxon Mobil's partner is the Japan Sakhalin Pipeline Company, whose shareholders include the Itochu Corporation, the Marubeni Corporation and the Japan Petroleum Exploration Company.</p>
        <p>''Diversity of supply is an important issue for energy buyers world-wide, and this pipeline would introduce an abundant, reliable and competitive source of energy for Japanese gas buyers,'' said Jack King, who is in charge of the new gas marketing office.</p>
        <p>With about $2 billion scheduled to be spent on development on this island every year until the end of the decade, Sakhalin's 591,000 residents are bracing for a major boom.</p>
        <p>''Come next summer, and we are going to hit a logjam of people -- cargo, airplanes, hotels, you name it,'' predicted James R. Sexton, an American business consultant who has worked here for the last decade. ''It's exciting times, just like Alaska was decades ago.''</p>
