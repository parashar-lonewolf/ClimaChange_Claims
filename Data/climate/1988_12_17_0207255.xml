        <p>LEAD: A landmark treaty to protect the earth's ozone shield came into force today as the European Community formally agreed to abide by its provisions.</p>
        <p>A landmark treaty to protect the earth's ozone shield came into force today as the European Community formally agreed to abide by its provisions.</p>
        <p>Now that the requisite number of nations have officially signed, nations ratifying the treaty will by the end of next year be required to freeze at 1986 levels the production and use of industrial chemicals believed to be destroying ozone molecules in the upper atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Countries adhering to the treaty, which was drafted by 42 nations in Montreal last year under the sponsorship of the United Nations Environmental Program, will also be required to cut production and use of these chemicals, chlorofluorocarbons and halons, by at least half by the end of the century. Hailed as a Major Step</p>
        <p>Many scientists, policy makers and environmentalists contend that scientific data that have emerged since the Montreal meeting show that the chemicals should be eliminated completely to protect the ozone layer from severe depletion.</p>
        <p>But they hailed the Montreal protocol, saying that it could be an important precedent for international cooperation on environmental problems like the warming of the earth caused by manmade gases in the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>The loss of ozone in the upper atmosphere permits higher levels of harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun to penetrate to the earth's surface. Such radiation can cause skin cancer, eye cataracts and damage to the immune system of humans as well as damage to crops, forests and wildlife. Over the Top</p>
        <p>The Montreal protocol on protecting the ozone layer required that at least 11 nations, representing at least two-thirds of world production of the offending chemicals, approve the treaty for it to come into effect.</p>
        <p>Today, the European Community filed a ratification notice binding its 12 members to the treaty, and member nations West Germany, Britain, Italy, Greece, the Netherlands, Spain, Ireland and Denmark filed duplicate notices. More than 20 countries, including the United States, have approved the protocol, and with the countries that signed on today they represent more than two-thirds of world production.</p>
