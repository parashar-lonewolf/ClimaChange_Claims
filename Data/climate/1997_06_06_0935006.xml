        <p>Following are excerpts from Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright's commencement address yesterday at Harvard University .  Her remarks were transcribed by the Federal News Service, a private transcription agency.</p>
        <p>British Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin called the Marshall Plan a ''lifeline to sinking men,'' and it was -- although I expect some women in Europe were equally appreciative.  By extending that lifeline, America helped unify Europe's west around democratic principles and planted seeds of trans-Atlantic partnership that would soon blossom in the form of NATO and the cooperative institutions of a new Europe.</p>
        <p>Just as important was the expression of American leadership that the Marshall Plan conveyed. After world War I, America had withdrawn from the world, shunning responsibility and avoiding risk. Others did the same. The result in the heart of Europe was the rise of great evil. After the devastation of World War II and the soul-withering horror of the Holocaust, it was not enough to say that the enemy had been vanquished --  that what we were against had failed.</p>
        <p>The generation of Marshall, Truman and Vandenberg was determined to build a lasting peace. And the message that generation conveyed from the White House, from both parties on Capitol Hill, and from people across our country who donated millions in relief cash, clothing, and food, was that, this time, America would not turn inward, America would lead.</p>
        <p>Today, in the wake of the cold war, it is not enough for us to say that Communism has failed. We, too, must heed the lessons of the past, accept responsibility and lead.</p>
        <p>Because we are entering a century in which there will be many interconnected centers of population, power, and wealth, we cannot limit our focus, as Marshall did in his speech, to the devastated battleground of a prior war. Our vision must encompass not one, but every continent.</p>
        <p>Unlike Marshall's generation, we face no single galvanizing threat. The dangers we confront are less visible and more diverse, some as old as ethnic conflict, some as new as letter bombs, some as subtle as climate change, and some as deadly as nuclear weapons falling into the wrong hands.</p>
        <p>To defend against these threats, we must take advantage of the historic opportunity that now exists to bring the world together in an international system based on democracy, open markets, law and a commitment to peace.</p>
        <p>We know that not every nation is yet willing or able to play its full part in this system. One group is still in transition from centralized planning and totalitarian rule. Another has only begun to dip its toes into economic and political reform. Some nations are still too weak to participate in a meaningful way. And a few countries have regimes that actively oppose the premises upon which this system is based.</p>
        <p>Because the situation we face today is different from that confronted by Marshall's generation, we cannot always use the same means. But we can summon the same spirit.</p>
        <p>We can strive for the same sense of bipartisanship that allowed America in Marshall's day to present to both allies and adversaries a united front.</p>
        <p>We can invest the resources needed to keep America strong economically, militarily and diplomatically, recognizing, as did Marshall, that these strengths reinforce each other.</p>
        <p>We can act with the same knowledge that, in our era, American security and prosperity are linked to economic and political health abroad.</p>
        <p>And we can recognize, even as we pay homage to the heroes of history, that we have our own duty to be authors of history.</p>
        <p>Let every nation acknowledge: today, the opportunity to be part of an international system based on democratic principles is available to all. This was not the case 50 years ago. . . .</p>
        <p>Today, there is no Stalin to give orders. If a nation is isolated from the international community now, it is either because the country is simply too weak to meet international standards or because its leaders have chosen willfully to disregard those standards.</p>
        <p>Last week, in the Netherlands, President Clinton said that no democratic nation in Europe would be left out of the trans-Atlantic community. Today, I say that no nation in the world need be left out of the global system we are constructing. And every nation that seeks to participate, and is willing to do all it can to help itself, will have America's help in finding the right path. . . .</p>
        <p>As this great university has recognized in the foreign students it has attracted, the research it conducts, the courses it offers and the sensibility it conveys, those of you who have graduated today will live global lives. You will compete in a world marketplace; travel further and more often than any previous generation; share ideas, tastes and experience with counterparts from every culture, and recognize that to have a full and rewarding future, you will have to look outward.</p>
        <p>As you do, and as our country does, we must aspire to the high standard set by Marshall, using means adapted to our time based on values that endure for all time, and never forgetting that America belongs on the side of freedom. I say this to you as Secretary of State. I say it also as one of the many people whose lives have been shaped by the turbulence of Europe during the middle of this century and by the leadership of America throughout this century.</p>
        <p>I can still remember, in England during the war, sitting in the bomb shelter, singing away the fear, thanking God for American help.</p>
        <p>I can still remember, after the war and after the Communist takeover in Prague, arriving here in the United States, where I wanted only to be accepted and to make my parents and my new country proud.</p>
        <p>Because my parents fled in time, I escaped Hitler. To our shared and constant sorrow, millions did not.</p>
        <p>Because of America's generosity, I escaped Stalin. Millions did not.</p>
        <p>Because of the vision of the Truman-Marshall generation, I have been privileged to live my life in freedom. Millions have still never had that opportunity.</p>
        <p>It may be hard for you, who have no memory of that time fifty years ago, to understand. But it is necessary that you try to understand. . . .</p>
        <p>Today, the greatest danger to America is not some foreign enemy; it is the possibility that we will fail to heed the example of that generation; that we will allow the momentum toward democracy to stall, take for granted the institutions and principles upon which our own freedom is based, and forget what the history of this century reminds us: that problems, if left unattended, will all too often come home to America.</p>
        <p>A decade or two from now, we will be known as the neo-isolationists, who allowed tyranny and lawlessness to rise again, or as the generations that solidified the global triumph of democratic principles.</p>
        <p>We will be known as the neo-protectionists, whose lack of vision produced financial meltdown, or as the generations that laid the groundwork for rising prosperity around the world.</p>
        <p>We will be known as the world-class ditherers, who stood by while the seeds of renewed global conflict were sown, or as the generations that took strong measures to forge alliances, deter aggression and keep the peace.</p>
        <p>There is no certain road map for success, either for individuals or for generations. Ultimately, it is a matter of judgment, a question of choice.  In making that choice, let us remember that there is not a page of American history of which we are proud that was authored by a chronic complainer or prophet of despair. We are doers.</p>
        <p>We have a responsibility in our time, as others have had in theirs, not to be prisoners of history, but to shape history; a responsibility to fill the role of pathfinder, and to build with others a global network of purpose and law that will protect our citizens, defend our interests, preserve our values, and bequeath to future generations a legacy as proud as the one we honor today.</p>
        <p>To that mission, I pledge my own best efforts and summon yours.</p>
