      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial holds that although many scoffed when Arnold Schwarzenegger said he was running for governor of California six months into job he can seemingly do no wrong; cites his achievements, noting that as an executive he is at once flexible and determined; says his current 64 percent approval rating could evaporate in time, but right now this 'accidental governor' is starting to seem almost inevitable</p>

        <p>Here's one recipe for political success: Wealth, independently acquired. Enormous self-confidence. A brand of Republicanism coupling liberal social views with fiscal pragmatism. This mix has worked well for Michael Bloomberg, who, despite low popularity ratings, has turned out to be a productive and innovative New York City mayor. And it seems to be working even better for Arnold Schwarzenegger, California's governor. Six months into the job, the last action hero can seemingly do no wrong.</p>
        <p>Of the two story lines, Mr. Schwarzenegger's is the more improbable. Though people questioned Mr. Bloomberg's political experience, nobody scoffed at him the way they scoffed at Mr. Schwarzenegger, who was variously derided as a Hollywood lightweight and as an accidental product of California's crazy recall system, a crippling economic crisis and the staggering unpopularity of the incumbent, Gray Davis.</p>

        <p>Here's one recipe for political success: Wealth, independently acquired. Enormous self-confidence. A brand of Republicanism coupling liberal social views with fiscal pragmatism. This mix has worked well for Michael Bloomberg, who, despite low popularity ratings, has turned out to be a productive and innovative New York City mayor. And it seems to be working even better for Arnold Schwarzenegger, California's governor. Six months into the job, the last action hero can seemingly do no wrong.</p>
        <p>Of the two story lines, Mr. Schwarzenegger's is the more improbable. Though people questioned Mr. Bloomberg's political experience, nobody scoffed at him the way they scoffed at Mr. Schwarzenegger, who was variously derided as a Hollywood lightweight and as an accidental product of California's crazy recall system, a crippling economic crisis and the staggering unpopularity of the incumbent, Gray Davis.</p>
        <p>This page was among the vocal doubters, but nobody's laughing now. Since ousting Mr. Davis last October, Mr. Schwarzenegger has ended years of paralysis in the California Legislature and delivered on a string of campaign promises, like winning public approval for a $15 billion bond issue and reforming the state's hugely expensive workers' compensation system. Last week, in an announcement barely noticed outside the state, the governor offered a comprehensive energy plan that dealt the final blow to the unfettered deregulation that helped cause a series of blackouts in 2000, bankrupted a major utility and marked the beginning of the end for Mr. Davis. He then flew off to Israel, Jordan and the troops in Germany.</p>
        <p>Governor Schwarzenegger has had his stumbles. Given the fiscal crisis, it was surely a mistake to repeal $4 billion in automobile tax increases. His budget plan -- which essentially involves issuing new debt to pay off old debt -- could backfire if California's economy sours again. But at least things are beginning to happen. As Leon Panetta, a prominent California Democrat, said of the bond issue, adding to an already overburdened budget was the worst possible solution -- except for all the others.</p>
        <p>Celebrity helps a lot, as does wealth. Both provide protection against special interests. The governor's independence from the White House on issues like air pollution and global warming cannot hurt him in an environmentally conscious, largely Democratic state. As an executive, he is at once flexible and determined. He prevailed on the workers' compensation issue by agreeing to settle for less than he wanted while threatening to go directly to the voters if the Legislature did nothing at all. For good measure he gathered the negotiators in a windowless war room, where they survived on M&amp;M's and the governor's special blend of trail mix.</p>
        <p>Even his critics find him a hard man to dislike. This is a governor who bombs around the freeways with his old motorcycle buddies every weekend, who loves a crowd and whose favorite word is ''fantastic.'' His wife is ''fantastic.'' Gray Davis is ''fantastic.'' He even described a $4 million judgment against him in a campaign finance case as a ''fantastic'' decision. Criticism bounces off like rubber bullets. When John Burton, the Democratic leader in the State Senate, accused him of ''pontificating,'' the governor called him up and said: ''That's funny! Pontificate. Like the pope!'' ''Nothing fazes him,'' Mr. Burton observed.</p>
        <p>Right now Californians are giving him fantastic leeway -- a 64 percent approval rating, including a majority of those describing themselves as liberals and Democrats, according to a recent Los Angeles Times poll. The poll also showed that if Mr. Schwarzenegger needed to renege on his no-new-taxes promise, most people would support him.</p>
        <p>All this good feeling could evaporate. Colorful newcomers have a way of wilting, as Mr. Bloomberg's popularity did when hypothetical tax increases became real. But for now, the accidental governor, besides having a great time, is starting to seem almost inevitable.</p>
