        <p>Midway through President Bush's journey across Europe, from the friendly terrain of Britain to the violent protests in Genoa to the bleak border between Kosovo and Macedonia, a senior German official offered this revised assessment of how the president is viewed by his closest allies.</p>
        <p>''We're getting used to him,'' he said.</p>
        <p>It was a phrase that came up often on this trip, six months into Mr. Bush's presidency, as a prelude to both guarded praise and harsh criticism. If Mr. Bush's first foray to Europe in June was, to use his own phrase, all about ''icebreaking,'' this one was mostly deal-making. And his performance alternately perplexed and pleased.</p>
        <p>Over the week the Europeans saw all the contradictory shades that have made him so hard to define in domestic politics: the defiant Bush, the obstinate Bush, the creative Bush, and the malleable Bush.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush was defiant when it came to the protests that racked Genoa during the meeting of the leaders of the world's largest industrialized nations and Russia. He declared the people on the streets plain wrong, saying they should just accept as a matter of fact that free trade is the only path out of poverty. He appeared not the least bit interested in entertaining the intellectual arguments about whether borderless competition worsens the gap between rich and poor.</p>
        <p>''I know what I believe,'' he said Sunday night in the Roman Forum and added, ''and I believe what I believe is right.''</p>
        <p>He was obstinate when the subject turned to the Kyoto Protocol on global warming. Mr. Bush told the leaders in Genoa that they should sit and wait until his administration came up with an alternative plan, but he would not say when.</p>
        <p>So they papered over their dispute in the meeting's communiqu√© and then delivered him a stinging rebuke in Bonn, where a simultaneous conference resolved long disputes over specific language on how countries will define and limit their emissions of carbon dioxide. One hundred and seventy-eight countries agreed, but not the United States.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Bush seemed just to shrug when asked whether the United States had isolated itself. His aides suggested the treaty was worth little if Washington did not sign, leading one senior Japanese official to ask a reporter how long it would take for the White House team to ''rid itself of this American arrogance.''</p>
        <p>But at the next moment, Europe saw the creative Bush, who can capitalize on his freshness to the world scene to force a rethinking of old approaches. In this case, the issue was the balance of nuclear terror 12 years after the cold war ended.</p>
        <p>By the end of the week, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia all said that Mr. Bush was right to force the world to think about a new ''strategic framework'' that links drastic cuts in bloated, unnecessary nuclear arsenals to the first talks over missile defenses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush looked elated. ''You saw the president yesterday,'' he said of Mr. Putin. ''I thought he was very forward-leaning, as they say in diplomatic nuanced circles.'' Then Mr. Berlusconi stepped in to suggest, ever so gently, that Mr. Bush would be wise to tone down his threats about dumping the Antiballistic Missile Treaty if Mr. Putin does not reach an accord soon enough.</p>
        <p>''They come from a past,'' Mr. Berlusconi said of the Russians. ''They were a world power. They had a very strong fall as far as their economy was concerned.'' But they have ''that old pride,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And then, driving home the point to Mr. Bush, he said, ''I believe that this can all be done without unilateral measures.''</p>
        <p>Finally, Mr. Bush came close to full circle on a position he took in the campaign: that American troops should withdraw as soon as practical from the Balkans, leaving the Europeans to keep the peace. When Mr. Bush landed at Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo this morning, he told the troops that they play a vital role, declaring that America and its allies ''came in together, and we will leave together.''</p>
        <p>His only nod to his old view is the statement that ''our goal is to hasten the day when peace is self-sustaining,'' which was, in the end, the goal of President Clinton before him.</p>
        <p>The Balkan experience has convinced the Europeans of one thing: Mr. Bush can, under the right conditions, be persuaded to change his mind. A senior French official at the Genoa meeting said the caricatures that filled the French press for months of a dumb cowboy are ''plain silly.''</p>
        <p>''He's a good listener,'' the official said. ''He has his convictions, but it's not as though he's not open to discussion.''</p>
        <p>But these many faces of the new president have left the Europeans posing the same question as Congressional Democrats: when Mr. Bush says he wants to consult, does he mean he wants to converse for a while then go ahead as planned? And how does one reconcile his seeming absence of intellectual curiosity about the roiling debate over globalization with his intense engagement on the subject of nuclear defenses and embryonic stem cell research?</p>
        <p>Perhaps one reason that it is taking the world so long to get used to Mr. Bush is that his interests bear little resemblance to Bill Clinton's. Mr. Clinton could wax on for hours about the pros and cons of a free trade and its intersection with domestic and world politics.</p>
        <p>In fact, he would talk about the issue so much that he got himself into trouble. Mr. Clinton's public musing about strategies to spread American-style environmental standards and labor rights around the world so terrified developing nations at the Seattle trade conference in 1999 that they sank Mr. Clinton's hopes for another round of global trade talks.</p>
        <p>''Our responsibility is to help countries prepare for the new world they are entering, not to talk endlessly,'' said Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Bush's national security adviser, during a break in the Genoa meeting. ''Rather than say. 'On-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand,' President Bush has a concrete way to say to Senegal and El Salvador, 'This will help you.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's fellow leaders, when speaking publicly, say they detect signs that he is becoming more internationalist as he gains experience. ''We were all pleased by his new orientation,'' President Jacques Chirac of France said at the end of the Genoa meeting, where Mr. Bush had solicited Mr. Chirac's views at length on the Middle East.</p>
        <p>But it will be a long while before Mr. Bush can erase the early image  of a man who defines America's national interests narrowly and who looks to unilateralism when frustrated by slow diplomacy.</p>
        <p>Of course, it took Mr. Clinton more than two years to define his diplomatic style and one senior American diplomat, a veteran of the debates over Bosnia, noted this weekend that ''getting him to the right place wasn't pretty.'' Getting Mr. Bush there, in the midst of the global warming debate and the fragile new arms talks with Russia, may not be much prettier.</p>
