        <p>LINDA McCARTNEY, who for more than two decades has been trying to convince people to give up meat, is taking her mission a giant step forward next week: she is to open a factory in Fakenham in Norfolk, England, that can produce one million vegetarian meals a week, The Observer reported on Sunday.</p>
        <p>According to the British newspaper, Mrs. McCartney's brand of frozen porkless sausages, meatless pies and chickenless Kievs, introduced in England four years ago by a division of the multinational company United Biscuits, is enormously successful. Last year, she sold her 100 millionth meal.</p>
        <p>The new factory will have a vegetarian canteen; ammonia refrigerant, which is said to be relatively benign for the ozone layer, and natural gas. Employees will be provided with nonleather shoes.</p>
        <p>Despite the company's success, Mrs. McCartney, wife of Paul McCartney, the former Beatle, told The Observer that profit was never her motive. She and her husband, once fanciers of meat, she said, were converted 25 years ago when they saw lambs gamboling outside a window as they sat down to a lunch of lamb. "I strongly believe that we can't continue to eat animals," she said. "It's killing the environment and it's very unkind." NADINE BROZAN</p>
