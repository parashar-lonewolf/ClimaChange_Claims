        <p>THE Toyota Prius, the world's first mass-produced hybrid vehicle, has been a success in Japan since it went on sale last December. In about two years, Americans will have a chance to sample the car for themselves.</p>
        <p>The Prius (pronounced PREE-us) combines a gasoline engine with an electric motor, thereby promising pollution levels nearly as low as those of fully electric vehicles but with the everyday practicality of a conventional gasoline-powered automobile. For that reason, many engineers are more excited about the potential of hybrid vehicles than they are about electric cars.</p>
        <p>In the eight months the Prius has been on the market in Japan, more than 7,700 have been sold. That certainly qualifies as a success, at least as measured against the modest expectations for any alternative vehicle.</p>
        <p>Sales are strong partly because Toyota is selling the vehicle for 2.15 million yen, about $15,500 -- well below the car's development and production costs and only about $1,500 more than the similarly sized Corolla.</p>
        <p>Toyota says the Prius will reach the American market late in 2000. The price in the United States and other details of the American model have not been determined, but the challenge here will be greater than in Japan. Gasoline prices in the United States are a fraction of Japanese prices.  Moreover, Toyota must substantially tweak the design if the Prius is to deliver its promised fuel economy and low emissions under American driving conditions.</p>
        <p>In Japan's standard fuel-economy test, the Prius gets a remarkable 66 miles a gallon, about double the fuel efficiency of a similar gasoline car. It also has half the gasoline car's carbon dioxide emissions and only 10 percent as much output of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons.</p>
        <p>Toyota executives said at a recent news conference here that their goal was for the American version to achieve 60 m.p.h. and to qualify for California's new proposed category of ''super ultra-low-emission'' vehicle.</p>
        <p>Since the Prius uses gasoline, it cannot be a zero-emission vehicle. But under a proposal before the California Air Resources Board, such ''super ultra low'' vehicles would be granted some credit toward meeting the future requirement that 10 percent of the vehicles sold by major manufacturers  meet zero-emission standards.</p>
        <p>While Toyota might at first concentrate in California and some other environmentally conscious markets, it eventually hopes to sell nationwide and does not want the car to be typecast as a fringe vehicle.</p>
        <p>Hiroshi Okuda, the Toyota's president, recently announced in Japan that the company plans to export 20,000 Priuses a year starting in 2000, many of them no doubt bound for the United States. By contrast, in the last year only a few hundred electric vehicles have been sold in the United States by all manufacturers combined.</p>
        <p>Fully electric vehicles are expensive and can only be driven about 100 miles or so before the batteries must be recharged, a process that takes several hours. The Prius, by contrast, can be filled up at a gasoline station like any other car. It uses power from the gasoline engine to recharge the batteries as the car is driven, so it is never necessary to go to a recharging station.</p>
        <p>Because the batteries and gasoline help each other, the Prius can get by with smaller versions of each, cutting costs and weight. The batteries, for instance, weigh only about one-fifteenth as much as those in a fully electric vehicle. And the gasoline engine has a capacity of only 1.5 liters.</p>
        <p>Under complex computer control, the Prius switches from battery power to gasoline power, or a combination of the two, automatically and seamlessly. The driver just steps on the fuel pedal and is oblivious to what is powering the car.</p>
        <p>When the car is idle or starting up at slow speed, it is powered by the batteries alone. Therefore, there is no pollution or gasoline wasted when the car is, say, mired in traffic.</p>
        <p>At moderate speeds, the car is powered by the gasoline engine. Some of the engine power that is not used to drive the vehicle is diverted to a generator to make electricity used to recharge the battery.</p>
        <p>At very high speeds or during full-throttle acceleration, the battery and the gasoline engine work together.</p>
        <p>The small gasoline engine alone, for instance, can make the car go as fast as 80 m.p.h. But with the batteries kicking in, the speed can hit 110. Once the batteries run down, the speed would drop back below 80, even though the driver maintains constant pressure on the accelerator.</p>
        <p>This situation would not be faced by most drivers. At lower speeds, the Japanese version of the Prius performed just like a regular car. In a short test drive, it was virtually impossible to tell when the car shifted from battery power to gasoline and back.</p>
        <p>The squat four-door sedan, designed at Toyota's studio in Newport Beach, Calif., can seat five, four quite comfortably, with enough room in the back seat for tall people. Its acceleration is somewhat sluggish, but that is not unusual for a car of its size.</p>
        <p>The Prius's dashboard contains a small video screen that displays a schematic diagram of the car's inner workings, using moving arrows to show how the energy is flowing at any given instant, whether from the battery or the gasoline engine. This quickly becomes distracting to the driver. Most drivers probably wouldn't care what is happening under the hood anyway, since it has no bearing on how they drive.</p>
        <p>But what was most revealing was when a button labeled ''fuel economy'' was pressed. The display changed to a bar graph showing the car's fuel economy over the last half-hour, broken up into five-minute intervals.</p>
        <p>What's this? In one 20-minute test drive mainly on city streets with one two-mile stretch of Los Angeles freeway, the Prius achieved only about 24 m.p.g., far less than the 66 m.p.g. advertised and not even as good as many small all-gasoline cars.</p>
        <p>Admittedly, test drivers accelerate more quickly than an average motorist would, but that is not the whole story. The fuel economy and low emissions of a hybrid come mainly from using batteries instead of gasoline. But that happens mainly at speeds up to about 10 m.p.h. At higher speeds, when the car relies mainly on gasoline, the Prius is not much more fuel-efficient than other cars.</p>
        <p>In the Japanese mileage test, which simulates congested city driving, the vehicle travels at an average speed of about 14 m.p.h., according to Toshihiro Oi, the chief engineer of the Prius. Even near downtown Los Angeles, we were going much faster than that. Moreover, we had the air-conditioner running, meaning the gasoline engine was working while the car was stopped.</p>
        <p>Toyota officials acknowledge that they have work to do to deliver the promise of the Prius under American driving conditions. Right now, for instance, the Japanese version of the car would qualify only as a ''low-emission vehicle'' in California, two ranks below the rating Toyota hopes to obtain with the American version.</p>
        <p>For now, Toyota has managed to design an alternative vehicle that elegantly succeeds in functioning like a gasoline-powered car -- perhaps too much so.</p>
