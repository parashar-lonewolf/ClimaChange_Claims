        <p>LEAD: MUCH of the sulfuric gas pumped into the atmosphere by man and nature falls out in acid rain, but some molecules can penetrate the upper reaches and hover like an impenetrable cloud.</p>
        <p>MUCH of the sulfuric gas pumped into the atmosphere by man and nature falls out in acid rain, but some molecules can penetrate the upper reaches and hover like an impenetrable cloud.</p>
        <p>Violent volcanic eruptions inject the largest amounts of sulfur into the stratosphere, but a stable layer of sulfur-containing aerosol that persists in between these events is considered the background level. During the last decade, the background level of nonvolcanic sulfates in the stratosphere has increased at an alarming annual rate of about 5 percent, according to a study published in the current issue of the journal Science.</p>
        <p>High levels of sulfur in the stratosphere can block sunlight, resulting in a milky sky and an eventual cooling of the earth. Sulfur also contributes to the destruction of the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>Just what is causing the rise in sulfur concentrations is not yet understood, said D. J. Hofmann, a physicist at the University of Wyoming who is the author of the study. He has been measuring atmospheric aerosols each month since 1971 over Laramie, Wyo., at an altitude of about 13 miles.</p>
        <p>The increasing amounts of sulfurous gases released from burning forests and fossil fuels, petroleum refining and other industrial processes, do not fully account for the higher levels in the stratosphere, he said. Other natural sources or previously overlooked human causes must be identified.</p>
        <p>Recent measurements suggest that human-induced emissions may be larger than previously believed. Stratospheric sulfur concentrations are much lower in the Southern Hemisphere than in more populated Northern Hemisphere, Professor Hofmann said. One possible culprit is the emissions from a growing number of airplanes flying closer to the stratosphere, the study said.</p>
        <p>''There are not enough studies pinpointing the sources of sulfur emissions or monitoring the levels in the stratosphere,'' Professor Hofmann said. ''I hope this paper will increase interest.''  SCIENCE WATCH</p>
