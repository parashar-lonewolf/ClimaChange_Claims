        <p>IT'S finally spring. Or is it? With so many false springs this year, snow may yet fall on the tulips. Or maybe a northeaster, as happened last weekend.</p>
        <p>Spring came prematurely to New York twice: first in January, when daffodils and Japanese apricots bloomed in 70-degree weather, before the mercury took a dive to 19 degrees; and again in February, when temperatures hovered in the 70s, and then fell to the 20s.</p>
        <p>Each time, gardeners at the New York Botanical Garden hurried to cover vulnerable plants with burlap tents.</p>
        <p>They saved the Edgeworthia chrysantha (paperbush), which is now blooming beautifully and gives off a spicy fragrance. The camellias survived, though their satiny green leaves look a bit burned. Pineapple lilies rotted in the cold, wet ground, and a venerable rosemary died down to its roots.</p>
        <p>In Louisville, Ky., Sissy Nash and two helpers recently rushed to protect about a hundred peonies in her garden, as well as astilbes and other plants that had started to bloom as temperatures rose to the 80s on April 1, a Sunday, then plunged to the 20s by the following Wednesday and stayed there four days.</p>
        <p>''We worked desperately all day, covering them with Reemay, if we could find it,'' Mrs. Nash said, referring to the spun polyester used to protect plants from frost. She stuck pots over smaller plants, with a brick on top to keep them from falling over in the wind.</p>
        <p>It was desperate work, at a mad pace. But it was worth it, Mrs. Nash said, because ''most of the plants survived.'' But there wasn't time to cover all of them, and many of those left uncovered -- blooming tulips, hostas, clematis -- were ruined. The wisteria looked like a dirty lavender dishrag.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago snow fell on Madison, Wis., after 80-degree temperatures had brought the daffodils and hellebores into full bloom. ''Now they're flopping on the ground,'' said Edward R. Hasselkus, an emeritus professor of horticulture at the University of Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>''I can't remember another year when this has happened,'' Mr. Hasselkus said. ''Obviously, we've had late snows, but not plunging from 80 down to 18.''</p>
        <p>In Seattle plants suffered through an extremely wet, cold winter.</p>
        <p>''In 20 years of gardening, this is the hardest winter we've ever had,'' said Daniel J. Hinkley, the plant collector who gardens on the usually balmy Kitsap Peninsula, just west of Seattle. ''We've lost about 20 percent of our plants from excessive rain,'' he said, ''followed by the lowest temperatures ever experienced in Washington.'' Plants native to many areas that were hardy until this year -- echiums, agaves, aloes and opuntias -- all died, he said.</p>
        <p>Just how to garden in these erratic times is the subject of ''Gardening in a Changing Climate,'' a three-day symposium at the New York Botanical Garden that is open to the public and begins tomorrow. Three scientists will talk about patterns of global warming and what people can do to ease the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, by taking steps like recycling and using less synthetic fertilizer on their lawns. Garden discussions with experts will delve into basic good-garden practices that can make the difference between success and failure in such wildly variable conditions.</p>
        <p>Composting and soil preparation will be the mantras, as well as choosing appropriate plants and siting them properly. There will be plenty of consideration of pests, which thrive in warmer winters and longer growing seasons.</p>
        <p>John Grant, a New York arborist, will speak on Sunday about how to use growing degree-days, as well as phenology (the study of naturally recurring phenomena), to monitor pests and diseases and control them with horticultural oil, which smothers them.</p>
        <p>It's crucial, though, to know when the insects will emerge. A simple formula can be used to calculate approximately when plants will flower and develop -- and when the insects that pollinate or prey upon them will show up. For an explanation of how it works in different regions, you can contact state agricultural schools or extension services, which should be able to discuss the formula and provide a list of pests to watch for as growing degree-days add up.</p>
        <p>''When we hit 804 cumulative growing degree units, you will see Japanese beetle activity,'' Mr. Grant said. (Northeast gardeners can find this information at www.gardening.cornell.edu/weather/gdd.html.)</p>
        <p>Gardeners will also have a chance to study the plants in the Ladies Border, a garden devoted to testing marginally hardy plants, on the southeast side of the Enid A. Haupt Conservatory. And they will see that some have done better than others.</p>
        <p>''We've learned that broad-leafed evergreens do much better in partial shade,'' Sarah Carter, the curator of herbaceous plants and outdoor gardens, said on a walk through the garden one sunny day a few weeks ago. She pointed out tree peonies, camellias and daphnes, all thriving under tall firs.</p>
        <p>Yuccas and agapanthus basked in the sun. Even a palm, Trachycarpus takil, grows here, given a burlap tent for winter protection.</p>
        <p>Watering newly planted trees and shrubs until they develop good root systems has never been more important. Early planting of hardy shrubs and perennials helps too.</p>
        <p>''Planting them after the last frost gives them a whole season to get established,'' Ms. Carter said. ''And protect them for one or two winters with burlap or extra mulch, which can be removed in spring.''</p>
        <p>(County extension services are good sources for the last frost date in particular areas; in New York City, for instance, it's around May 15.)</p>
        <p>And don't be too tidy on a warm spring day, if there is still danger that temperatures may plunge. All those dead leaves on your hellebores are actually protecting the crowns and the tender green shoots.</p>
        <p>Ms. Carter bent over her favorite hellebore, Honeyhill Joy, whose creamy white flowers looked up, right into her face. With a few pine boughs over its crown, it sailed through this year's severe temperature fluctuations.</p>
        <p>Expert Advice for an Uncertain Forecast</p>
        <p>''GARDENING in a Changing Climate,'' a three-day symposium at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx, begins tomorrow, with three scientists discussing the effects of global warming on plants and gardens: Cameron P. Wake, a research associate professor at the Climate Change Research Center at the University of New Hampshire; David W. Wolfe, a professor of plant ecology at Cornell; and Peter Del Tredici, a research scientist at the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard.</p>
        <p>Tomorrow's symposium, from 9:30 to 11:30 a.m., is $40 for nonmembers, $36 for members. Registration for that session: (718) 817-8747.</p>
        <p>Saturday and Sunday will feature programs from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., for home gardeners. These workshops are free, though they require admission to the garden for nonmembers ($13 for adults, $11 for people 62 and older, and $5 for children). Horticulturists will explain how environmental changes have affected plants, and what gardeners can do to ease imbalances. They will offer tips on the fundamentals of good gardening, and answer specific questions.</p>
        <p>Information, directions and workshop schedules: nybg.org or (718) 817-8700.</p>
