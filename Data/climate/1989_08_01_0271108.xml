        <p>LEAD: AS Congress considers clean- air legislation that would require millions of new cars to run on fuel other than gasoline, many Government analysts and environmentalists are questioning whether methanol, the most likely alternative, will significantly reduce air pollution.</p>
        <p>AS Congress considers clean- air legislation that would require millions of new cars to run on fuel other than gasoline, many Government analysts and environmentalists are questioning whether methanol, the most likely alternative, will significantly reduce air pollution.</p>
        <p>Methanol, fuel made from methyl alcohol, costs about as much as gasoline and can be used in conventional gasoline engines when mixed with a little gasoline.</p>
        <p>Engines designed to run on gasoline will not start on pure methanol when the temperature drops below 50 degrees. For that and other reasons, methanol is blended with gasoline, usually at a proportion of 85 percent methanol to 15 percent gasoline, to produce a fuel known as M85.</p>
        <p>While engines running on M85 emit fewer hydrocarbons and other harmful chemicals than gasoline engines, they produce considerably more formaldehyde, which is a health hazard in its own right and contributes as well to urban smog. No Fuel Specified</p>
        <p>''It's a growing consensus that methanol fuel vehicles don't have nearly the environmental benefits that are commonly thought,'' said Peter Blair, program manager for the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment's forthcoming alternative fuel report.</p>
        <p>Clean-air legislation proposed last month by President Bush calls for alternative fuels to be used in 500,000 new cars beginning in 1995, 750,000 new cars in 1996 and 1 million cars in 1997 and in years thereafter. It does not specify that the fuel must be methanol. But methanol blends are the only fuel, other than gasoline and diesel, for which the Environmental Protection Agency has established fuel emission standards.</p>
        <p>Auto makers have said they are reluctant to design engines to burn other alternative fuels before government guidelines for acceptable emissions levels are set.</p>
        <p>E.P.A. laboratory tests indicate that the amount of hydrocarbon emissions from cars designed to run on M100, which is 100 percent methanol, are 20 percent of those from for comparable gasoline cars. Hydrocarbons are complex chemicals that combine with other gases in the air and react to bright sunlight to form ozone, the major component of urban smog. For M85, the emissions rise to as much as 70 percent of the conventional level, the E.P.A says. Effect Termed 'Uncertain'</p>
        <p>But two Government draft reports call into question the ability of methanol-blend fuels to reduce air pollution.</p>
        <p>''The overall effect on urban ozone of shifting to methanol vehicles is very uncertain,'' according to an Office of Technology draft report to Congress. Methanol-gasoline mixtures ''may yield an increase in ozone-forming potential,'' the O.T.A. report said, because methanol evaporates more readily than gasoline, increasing the amount of hydrocarbons that escape to the air without even being burned.</p>
        <p>The unpublished draft of another report, for the Energy Department, found that ''emissions from methanol vehicles are for the most part comparable to those from gasoline fuel vehicles.'' The report, prepared by Argonne National Laboratories in Argonne, Ill., said methanol use would not provide short-term solutions to concerns about air pollution and in the long term could produce new pollution problems. Preferred 'Clean Fuel'</p>
        <p>Environmentalists say that even though the Government reports and other scientific studies comparing methanol blends, gasoline and other alternative fuels and their effect on air pollution are pointing away from methanol as a solution, the President's proposals are, in effect, running toward it as the preferred ''clean fuel.''</p>
        <p>''I think that the proposal puts too many of the President's eggs in the alternative-fuel basket, and this may crack some of those eggs,'' said Richard E. Ayres, chairman of the National Clean Air Coalition.</p>
        <p>An E.P.A. report on alternative fuels, scheduled for release later this month, will support the President's proposals, which include other measures aimed at cleaning the nation's air, said agency officals.</p>
        <p>''We believe that the air pollution benefits from methanol are potentially so great that the use of the fuel will establish the fact without question,'' said William G. Rosenberg, assistant administrator of the E.P.A. air and radiation division. 'Chicken and the Egg'</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosenberg said methanol's critics focus on M85, which he admitted will not achieve the pollution reduction levels claimed for pure methanol.</p>
        <p>''We are looking at M100 as the light at the end of the tunnel,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. also calculates, however, that the use of M85 alone will significantly reduce ozone levels in the air, a contention that is sharply disputed by methanol's critics.</p>
        <p>Even a previous E.P.A. report projected that if methanol blends were used in up to 26 percent of the vehicle miles traveled in New York, Washington and Los Angeles, there would be less than a 2 percent reduction in ozone levels.</p>
        <p>Catalytic converters, which in newer cars remove most of the hydrocarbons and formaldehyde from gasoline exhaust, can be adapted to do the same thing for the higher levels of formaldehyde generated by methanol. But automobile companies say that even the most advanced catalytic-converter technology will allow significant levels of formadelhyde to escape.</p>
        <p>Even the most technologically advanced prototypes of methanol-blend cars ''are only slightly cleaner than comparable gasoline vehicles,'' said Mark A. DeLuchi, an environmental policy analyst at the University of California at Davis. Research Termed Invalid</p>
        <p>Other pollutants, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide, are produced in similar amounts by M85 and gasoline as are gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect, like carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.</p>
        <p>But the complexities of the combustion process, and of the way chemicals leaving the tailpipe react with other gases in the atmosphere can significantly alter the overall effects. For example, while M85 produces fewer of the type of hydrocarbons that react readily to make smog, it produces other types of hydrocarbons that are less reactive. They too contribute to ozone formation; it just takes them longer.</p>
        <p>''Methanol offers no clear advantage over gasoline in reducing vehicle emissions levels,'' said Thomas C. Austin, an automotive engineer for Sierra Research Inc., an environmental consulting organization in Sacramento, Calif. ''Methanol's reputation as a 'clean fuel' is based on scientifically invalid research that was done more than a decade ago.''</p>
        <p>Charles L. Gray, the director of the E.P.A. emissions testing laboratory in Ann Arbor, Mich., said the assertion that methanol's clean-fuel reputation rides on old data ''is just ludicrous.''</p>
        <p>''Nobody can honestly suggest that we're not going to get the kind of reductions that we've found,'' Mr. Gray said. ''Tailpipe emission reductions translate directly into the reduction of ozone-forming potential in the air.'' Industry's Hand Seen</p>
        <p>Critics of methanol say the move toward it as an alternative fuel has more to do with the power and influence of the automobile manufacturers than with a concern for cleaning the air.</p>
        <p>Automobile companies prefer methanol to other alternative fuels because existing engines can run on methanol blends and new engine designs can easily be adapted to use the fuel.</p>
        <p>But methanol's proponents say many of its critics are allied with the oil companies, who have a powerful interest in keeping gasoline as the primary transportation fuel.</p>
