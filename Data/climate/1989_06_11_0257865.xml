        <p>LEAD: THE Chardonnay Restaurant at the Long Island Marriott in Uniondale has the appearance of a first-class hotel dining room.

        <p>THE Chardonnay Restaurant at the Long Island Marriott in Uniondale has the appearance of a first-class hotel dining room. It boasts snowy white tablecloths, sparkling crystal, impressive china, crisp professional service, a jungle of plants, soothing piano music and soaring ceilings outlined in starry lights.</p>
        <p>On closer inspection, much is illusion: half the plants are fakes, the music stems from a ghostly player piano and service sometimes stumbles and falters. All is a mixture of artificial and real, sham and substantial, pretentious and professional.</p>
        <p>The tableside preparation of Caesar salad is a microcosm of the restaurant. Traditionally, this salad's dressing is ceremoniously concocted before diners' eyes. At Chardonnay, with great tableside fanfare, a premixed dressing is unceremoniously tossed with greens and croutons.</p>
        <p>Salads aren't the only place where sophistication is surface deep. Waiters attempt to bluff their way through menu mixups. Only when a diner requested the menu did the waiter admit that the vegetable accompaniment for Texas tapas was supposed to be grilled, not steamed.</p>
        <p>The less-than-polished style of the staff is set by the manager, who introduced himself by his first name, did the same for the waiter and thanked us for ''trying Chardonnay.'' This casualness is out of synch with the formality of the restaurant.</p>
        <p>Despite Chardonnay's recently adopted seafood menu, canny diners with long experience in hotel dining rooms know that prime rib is often the superior choice. The hefty, succulent slab here beat out all surfside competition.</p>
        <p>Rack of lamb, comprised of seven juicy chops, and chicken Dijonais, three man-sized medallions atop green and white fresh linguine, also satisfied meat eaters.</p>
        <p>For openers, chunky-textured crab cakes paired with a spicy remoulade sauce were my favorites. The crab cakes are on a special menu that's part of a summerlong highlighting of seafood recipes from Marriott hotels nationwide. When the ''sea to shining sea'' celebration is over, this delectable appetizer deserves a spot on the regular menu.</p>
        <p>Top starters from the everyday list are the escargots sauteed with garlic and shiitake mushrooms enfolded in cream and served atop puff pastry, and the shrimp Le Mougin (four firm lovelies in a creamy white sauce punctuated with lime and ginger).</p>
        <p>Skip oysters Chardonnay, an ill-conceived mass of baked oysters topped with crab, mushrooms and spinach and a heavy pastry lid, all resting in a pool of pallid spinach Mornay sauce. Also skippable are oversized, chewy clams casino.</p>
        <p>Salads languish. The garden salad has flashes of radicchio, but is mainly limp iceberg lettuce. Our no-frills Caesar had so many pulverized crouton crumbs that it could have been labeled breaded salad.</p>
        <p>Every evening, eight different fresh fish can be ordered poached, baked, broiled, sauteed or blackened Cajun style. We sampled salmon, swordfish, grouper, brook trout and lemon sole in a variety of preparations. Excepting a slightly dry broiled swordfish, all were moist, fresh and pleasing. Cajun offerings are not for the timid, however. Seasoning is spirited.</p>
        <p>Desserts are a mixed lot. Remember two offerings on the special menu: fresh fruit topped with lemon sorbet over blueberry-raspberry puree and vanilla ice cream in a sweet, crisp cinnamon tortilla served with bananas and caramel sauce. The waiter says nothing about the availability of either when the dessert tray is presented.</p>
        <p>Best bets from the tray include cheesecake and chocolate mousse in a chocolate shell. The Napoleon, fruit tart and peach torte are listless.</p>
        <p>Marriott has made a major investment in cruvinets, making it possible to offer an extensive selection of wine by the glass. Although the wine list is far from Long Island's longest, around 100 different selections are available by the glass. Additionally, appropriate wine choices are menu-paired with each appetizer and entree.</p>
        <p>Coffee is also a star-spangled spectacular. A pot of Hawaiian Kona coffee is placed on the table with whipped cream, half and half, sugar lumps, white chocolate chunks, chocolate morsels, cinnamon sticks and licorice-chocolate add-ons. Along with the complimentary chocolate-dipped strawberries, diners are treated to a sweet sendoff.
