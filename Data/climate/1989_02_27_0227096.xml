        <p>The Economy</p>
        <p>Energy efficiency has stopped growing, ending a trend dating from the energy crisis of the early 1970's, U.S. statistics show. The shift means greater dependence on foreign oil, which is near an all-time high, and makes the U.S. more vulnerable to oil shortages and price increases. The change also bodes ill for efforts to limit smog, acid rain and the ''greenhouse effect.''  [ Page A1. ]</p>

        <p>Liz Claiborne's founders said they would retire in June from active management roles in the clothing company.

        <p>The Philippine economy has grown in each of the three years since Corazon C. Aquino became President. Despite questions about how strong the recovery has been and how long it can be sustained, the mood is optimistic.  [ D1. ]</p>
        <p>H. J. Heinz remains the only major U.S. company in Zimbabwe seven years after it began its profitable investment.  [ D4. ]</p>
        <p>Taiwan is on a buying spree, and U.S. cars are high on the shopping list. The Big Three enjoyed record sales there last year.  [ D4. ] The Media Business</p>
        <p>National Public Radio is ''on a roll,'' its president says, after repaying its debt and ending 1988 with a $7.8 million surplus.  [ D13. ]</p>
        <p>Will publishers and bookstores avoid controversial works, like the novel by Salman Rushdie, in the face of future threats? Despite pledges that there will be no concessions, some critics say the industry has left itself open to threats. Reporter's Notebook.  [ D13. ]</p>

        <p>Short-term rates may move higher in the next week or so, even without further tightening of credit by the Fed. People in the markets say current rates do not fully reflect last week's half-point rise in the Federal funds rate. Credit Markets.  [ D7. ]</p>
        <p>The dismantling of an effort to corner Chase Medical's stock is about to begin. After more than six weeks it is still unclear who will end up controlling most of the shares. Market Place.  [ D6. ]</p>
