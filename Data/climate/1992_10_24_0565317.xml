        <p>The White House is planning to announce a series of environmental regulations next week to focus attention on President Bush's environmental program just before the election, Administration officials and critics of the Administration said today.</p>
        <p>Although the announcements appear to be aimed in part at fending off assertions that the White House has undermined clean-air laws, some of the rules may lead to additional criticism of the Administration's environmental record.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the political strategy appears aimed in part at highlighting the Administration's differences with the Clinton campaign, appealing to industries that favor the Bush environmental program and the efforts of the White House Council on Competitiveness, led by Vice President Dan Quayle, to soften the impact of clean-air regulations on industry.</p>
        <p>To some extent, the way the regulations are received depends on whether they include provisions that have been pushed by White House officials over the objections of the Environmental Protection Agency. Signs of Softening</p>
        <p>Conflicts between the agency and White House offices over environmental issues have long held up important environmental regulations. Last month, the White House showed signs of softening some of its positions, when the White House chief of staff, James A. Baker 3d, ordered changes in a rule that would have allowed manufacturers to dispose of hazardous wastes in town dumps.</p>
        <p>At the time, Bush Administration officials said the change was made out of concern that the Bush campaign had become vulnerable to Democratic criticism on the environment.</p>
        <p>But in the past week, President Bush has been harshly critical of the Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate, Senator Al Gore, calling him "Mr. Ozone" for his views on how to cut air pollution.</p>
        <p>The Sierra Club, which has been critical of the Administration's record, said it had learned of five announcements, one scheduled for each day beginning Monday. Environmental groups were issued invitations on Thursday to briefings on some of the announcements.</p>
        <p>"This last minute flurry of activity will not obscure the fact that the Bush Administration has failed to issue dozens of needed regulations required under the Clean Air Act of 1990," said Blake Early, a Sierra Club official. Political Purposes</p>
        <p>A White House official said that while some of the regulations had been moving through the normal review process for months, announcing them right before the election also served political purposes.</p>
        <p>Some of the rules required by the Clean Air Act are being published well behind schedule, and others may have been weakened, but the Sierra Club said that one of the new rules, dealing with air pollution from coke ovens in the steel industry, is "strong enough that the environmental community will support it."</p>
        <p>But environmentalists might end up objecting to parts of the regulations on acid rain pollution. These regulations, which were to be published last May but have been held up by a White House review, establish an "allowance" system letting coal-fired power plants buy and sell pollution rights.</p>
        <p>The Administration won considerable praise for establishing this market-based approach to pollution control under the Clean Air Act.</p>
        <p>But the Sierra Club said the Office of Management and Budget was trying to allow municipal waste incinerators to qualify for conservation allowances that were intended to promote conservation and the use of renewable energy.</p>
