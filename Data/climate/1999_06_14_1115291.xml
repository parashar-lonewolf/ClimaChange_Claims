        <p>EFFORTS to make cars more environmentally sound have centered on designing cleaner-running engines, and eliminating the need for gasoline in favor of electricity. But presumably any car will still have an engine made up of some moving metal parts, and that requires lubricants. Cars, like trains, lawn mowers or chain saws, rely on petroleum-based motor oils. And that brings those concerned about the environment right back to the drawing board. Even an electric car may produce toxic waste from motor oil.</p>
        <p>But James Lambert and Duane Johnson have developed an alternative. They have patented a vegetable oil lubricant. Their invention can be circulated in internal combustion engines, or sprayed in one-time applications like those necessary for lubricating train rails.</p>
        <p>The inventors, from Colorado Springs, plan for their lubricant to be ''a total replacement for current petroleum and vegetable-based additives to petroleum.''</p>
        <p>Years ago, car owners who changed their own oil could just dump a pan of dirty black oil into the nearest sewer drain. Now that people understand how toxic oil waste can be to soil, water, plants, animals and people, used motor oil must be discarded carefully.</p>
        <p>But other petroleum-based lubricants are still regularly dumped in the open.</p>
        <p>Some lubricants are also used in what the inventors identify as ''total loss applications,'' in which oils are  applied only once and then thrown away. Trains use such oils, spewing huge amounts of petroleum waste onto the ground.</p>
        <p>''A train alone may consume five gallons of oil per 1,000 miles as the oil is sprayed on the track to lubricate the wheels,'' the inventors write in their patent. ''This amounts to a total of 300,000 gallons annually being discarded along railings within the U.S. alone.''</p>
        <p>Since the oils used in cars and on train rails are petroleum based, they are not biodegradable. In addition, chemicals are usually added to improve the oil's consistency and performance. And of course, these oils are distilled from crude petroleum, a nonrenewable natural resource.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lambert and Mr. Johnson hope to eliminate concerns over motor oils altogether. Their patent covers a vegetable oil lubricant they say is biodegradable as well as more efficient at lubrication and heat transfer than petroleum-based oils. Their lubricant uses three elements: a base oil, an oil made up of hydroxy fatty acids and an oil made up of vegetable or animal waxes.</p>
        <p>The patent stipulates that the base oil come from unrefined vegetable oils like soybean, canola, rapeseed, crambe, safflower or sunflower. The inventors prefer to get their hydroxy fatty acids from castor, and their waxes from jojoba, meadowfoam or lanolin. Natural antioxidants are also present in the lubricant, and the inventors say that synthetic antioxidants may also be added.</p>
        <p>The patent, which belongs to the Agro Management Group of Colorado Springs, is 5,888,947.</p>
        <p>Cleaning Up The Dry Cleaners</p>
        <p>The dry-cleaning industry has also been plagued with the environmental, health and occupational hazards of the solvent usually used to clean clothes, pechloroethylene. Researchers have worked for years to find an alternative to the chemical known commonly as Perc.</p>
        <p>William Hayday, from Woodbury, N.Y., and Stephen Bates, from Huntington, N.Y., have won a patent for an alternative they say cleans clothes better than Perc without any of Perc's drawbacks.</p>
        <p>Perc became popular in dry-cleaning because it does not ruin dyes, damage or shrink fabrics, and is nonflammable and easily distilled.</p>
        <p>But its uses are far more extensive than clothes cleaning. Perc is also a popular industrial degreasing agent.</p>
        <p>''The industrial uses of Perc are approximately tenfold greater than its use as a solvent for dry cleaning,'' the inventors state in their patent.</p>
        <p>But Perc is also damages water supplies, soil and the ozone layer. Any substitutes must prove as effective at dry cleaning and degreasing, while also being biodegradable and nontoxic.</p>
        <p>To that end, the inventors have discovered that ''a particular propylene glycol ether, when mixed with certain weight percentages of water to form an azeotropic mixture'' creates a solvent that cleans clothes better than Perc. (In an azeotropic mixture the vapor composition is identical to that of the liquid, the inventors explained, so the liquid and vapor act as one substance).</p>
        <p>The inventors say their patented solvent also degreases metals, cleans electronic components and scours and mills woolens better than Perc. It also weighs less than water, making it easier to dispose of, since unlike Perc, it will not sink to the bottom of a water supply.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hayday and Mr. Bates received patent 5,888,250.</p>
