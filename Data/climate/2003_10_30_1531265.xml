      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial says Senate's 56-day delay in confirming Pres Bush's appointment of Michael Leavitt to run Environmental Protection Agency reflects not on Leavitt but on Senate's displeasure with Bush's regressive environmental policies; calls on Leavitt to restore professional credibility of demoralized agency that for three years has been treated like extension of Karl Rove's political operation in White House</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Michael Leavitt, the Utah governor chosen by President Bush to run the Environmental Protection Agency, has finally won Senate confirmation after 56 days. The embarrassing delay was less a reflection of senatorial dismay with Mr. Bush's choice than a means of showing displeasure with his regressive environmental policies.</p>
        <p>Nobody expects Mr. Leavitt to try to change these policies, although there are steps he can quickly take to improve his reputation among environmentalists. There is a proposal on his desk to narrow the scope of the Clean Water Act. He should get rid of it. A deadline approaches for imposing controls on mercury emissions from power plants. He should meet it. But what is absolutely essential -- and what is clearly in Mr. Leavitt's power to do -- is to restore the professional credibility of a demoralized agency that for nearly three years has been treated like an extension of Karl Rove's political operation in the White House.</p>

        <p>Michael Leavitt, the Utah governor chosen by President Bush to run the Environmental Protection Agency, has finally won Senate confirmation after 56 days. The embarrassing delay was less a reflection of senatorial dismay with Mr. Bush's choice than a means of showing displeasure with his regressive environmental policies.</p>
        <p>Nobody expects Mr. Leavitt to try to change these policies, although there are steps he can quickly take to improve his reputation among environmentalists. There is a proposal on his desk to narrow the scope of the Clean Water Act. He should get rid of it. A deadline approaches for imposing controls on mercury emissions from power plants. He should meet it. But what is absolutely essential -- and what is clearly in Mr. Leavitt's power to do -- is to restore the professional credibility of a demoralized agency that for nearly three years has been treated like an extension of Karl Rove's political operation in the White House.</p>
        <p>Executive agencies inevitably reflect the preferences of the president they serve. But the E.P.A. has a long tradition of providing solid science and independent analysis on complex environmental questions. That reputation is now at risk, largely because the agency has been asked to manipulate or withhold science to serve political ends. The most shameful examples were two instances of censorship on global warming. In 2002, the White House ordered a chapter on climate change deleted from the E.P.A.'s annual report on air pollution trends. Last summer, as the agency was finishing a broad assessment of environmental problems, the White House ordered so many changes in the global warming chapter that Christie Whitman yanked all but a few paragraphs.</p>
        <p>In other cases, the agency has been told not to provide cost-benefit analyses to senators sponsoring bills that compete with the administration's own proposals, even though such information has been routinely furnished in the past.</p>
        <p>Building a firewall between the agency's scientists and White House politicians should be Mr. Leavitt's first task. That alone could lead to a higher level of environmental protection from an agency charged with providing it.</p>
