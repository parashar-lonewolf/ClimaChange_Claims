        <p>AS the residue of last week's snowstorm lingers in much of the Northeast, it may seem odd that inventors keep trying to perfect the manufacture of snow. But they do, and not just the stuff used at ski resorts.</p>
        <p>Two Swedish inventors, for instance, received a United States patent in December for a method of using artificial snow to kill bugs and other vermin.</p>
        <p>The two Swedes, Bertil Eliasson from Vallda and Per Hallberg from Savedalen, say the object of their invention is to freeze surfaces or spaces quickly so that ''harmful insects and other undesirable animals are cooled rapidly to kill them.'' In their patent, they write that carbon dioxide or another gas can be converted into a snow that will reach cold temperatures, stick easily and cover any surface thoroughly. The inventors say their method can be used to kill insects and other pests in the food industry, where insecticides are commonly used.</p>
        <p>''Traditional poisons are expensive, require careful cleaning and cause lengthy operating shutdowns,'' they write in their patent. ''The poisons create an unsafe working environment and pose the risk of contamination of foodstuffs. Confined spaces are often difficult or impossible to treat.''</p>
        <p>University studies in Sweden, the inventors say, have shown that ''rapid cooling is an effective way of killing insects.'' They recommend a decontamination recipe using five kilograms of carbon dioxide, an amount equivalent to ''the carbon dioxide exhaled by seven persons over a 24-hour period or produced by a car that is driven for approximately 20 kilometers.''</p>
        <p>''The method is thus nontoxic and environmentally friendly,'' they add. The snow produced can reach temperatures far below zero, the inventors said, which results in ''the 100 percent elimination of insect pests.''</p>
        <p>The snow machine consists of a gas cylinder of carbon dioxide that then passes into one or more small chambers, each of which is larger than the previous one. The gas is crystallized, and as the snow moves through the increasingly bigger chambers, small particles of snow are able to clump together into larger flakes. As the snow accumulates, it cools further. The gas may also pass through obstructions in the chambers, like brush bristles, tubes, thin strips or a rotating mechanism, and these act to shape the snow.</p>
        <p>The resulting snow is then blown through a nozzle onto surfaces, or into spaces where it can expand. The device has ''a pistol grip for regulation of the gas flow.'' The inventors say the snow becomes thicker if it comes into contact with a larger surface area, and colder if it mixes with snow that has already been formed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Eliasson and Mr. Hallberg received patent 6,491,231.</p>
        <p>Three inventors from Japan working on behalf of Bridgestone have won an American patent for a method of testing snow tires on a turntable covered with artificial snow.</p>
        <p>In their patent, the three inventors -- Koichi Usami, Kouichi Fukuda and Kazuyuki Yamanoi, all from Tochigi -- write that testing tire performance in snow generally involves ''a test course on which snow has accumulated,'' which they say creates the problem that ''testing can be performed only during winter, when snow has fallen.''</p>
        <p>They considered using artificial snow from pulverized ice or freezing sprayed water, they added, ''but the problem is that large-scale facilities are required for this method.'' That means building an indoor road, refrigerating it and then maintaining freezing air inside the building, they write in the patent. Such a system would use large quantities of water, which would have to be flushed through a sewer as waste when the tests were over.</p>
        <p>To get around the problems, the inventors designed a spinning turntable covered with ice and layers of snow for testing tires under various conditions. The device includes a turntable, a cooling element, an arm to support and rotate the tire, and a mechanism that presses the tire onto the artificial snow to simulate different loads applied to the tire. It also has brakes, so the tire's response to braking on snow can be measured.</p>
        <p>Their fake snow is made from a granular, water-absorbent material that expands when wet. They say it can be saved after each test session and used again.</p>
        <p>''The artificial snow may be compressed and used,'' they write, giving it ''a state similar to that of an actual compressed snowy road.''</p>
        <p>Adding more or less water will also change the snowy road conditions, they write. And they can reproduce driving conditions of acceleration, deceleration and slippage by tinkering with the tire speed.</p>
        <p>To keep the test tire from wearing a rut in the artificial snow, it is moved around the turntable, the inventors say. And the invention has a ''snowfall device,'' they added, so that an artificial snow layer can be created that closely mimics ''road surface conditions in which new snow has accumulated.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Usami, Mr. Fukuda and Mr. Yamanoi received patent 6,408,689.</p>
        <p>In a more decorative vein, Philip Culver of Sarasota, Fla. -- where snowfall rarely if ever transforms the outdoors -- owns a patent for a device that sprinkles artificial snow over the branches of trees to give them the winter wonderland look.</p>
        <p>His invention includes a blower stationed at the base of a tree and a tube that extends upward along the trunk. Along the length of the tube, dome-shaped discs are positioned at intervals. Each of these discharges artificial snow.</p>
        <p>''By this arrangement, artificial snow is uniformly dispersed to fall over the tree,'' Mr. Culver said. He received patent 5,098,084.</p>
