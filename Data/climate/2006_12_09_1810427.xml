        <p>THE American Association of Advertising Agencies thinks that doctors should keep their noses out of advertisers' business, even when those doctors think that advertisers are harming children.</p>

        <p>THE American Association of Advertising Agencies thinks that doctors should keep their noses out of advertisers' business, even when those doctors think that advertisers are harming children.</p>
        <p>At issue is a dire warning issued this week by the American Academy of Pediatrics, which called for severe restrictions on advertising aimed at children (pediatrics.aappublications.org). ''It's as dangerous for pediatricians to make recommendations about advertising as for me to write a prescription for a child's ear infection,'' the group's spokesman, Dick O'Brien, told AdAge.com.</p>
        <p>Exposure to some ads, the pediatrics group said, ''may contribute significantly to childhood and adolescent obesity, poor nutrition, and cigarette and alcohol use.'' Of particular concern, according to the report, published in the journal Pediatrics, are ''techniques to which children and adolescents are more susceptible,'' like product placements in movies and television shows and tie-ins among TV shows, commercials and children's toys. About one-fifth of all fast-food commercials mention a toy premium, the group said.</p>
        <p>According to the academy, advances in technology will only make things worse. ''Interactive games and promotions on digital TV will have the ability to lure children away from regular programming, encouraging them to spend a long time in an environment that lacks clear separation between content and advertising,'' the report states. ''Interactive technology may also allow advertisers to collect vast amounts of information about children's viewing habits and preferences and target them on the basis of that information.''</p>
        <p>Among other restrictions, the group called for regulations that would cut in half the number of commercials during children's programs; a ban on all tobacco advertising, including ads at sports arenas; a ban on alcohol ads that feature cartoon characters or ''attractive women;'' and a ban on junk-food ads during children's programs.</p>
        <p>Even with the new Democratic-controlled Congress, most of the restrictions have little chance of being instituted, Michael Jacobson, executive director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, told AdAge.com.</p>
        <p>But Don Shifrin of the academy said the overall goal was to draw attention to the problem. ''We think if we knock on the door enough times, sooner or later someone will answer,'' he said.</p>
        <p>MINING FOR DOLLARS -- The Energy Department announced last week that the federal government would provide $1 billion in tax credits to nine companies ''to bring about rapid deployment of advanced coal-based power generation and gasification technologies.'' Among the companies that will receive tax breaks are Duke Energy, TX Energy and the Southern Company (doe.gov)</p>
        <p>The technological improvements ''will bring us closer to the next step in the development of near-zero-emission power plants,'' the Energy Department said. Gasified coal can be burned with fewer harmful emissions than standard coal.</p>
        <p>But Todd Woody, author of the Green Wombat blog for Business 2.0 magazine, wrote this week that gasification ''does nothing to ameliorate the high environmental costs and greenhouse emissions that result from coal mining itself.'' He also noted that environmentalists have singled out several of the companies for the pollution emitted by their coal plants (blogs.business2.com).</p>
        <p>MAN EATERS -- Among the many recent TV commercials that equate unhealthful eating with virility, which is the worst? Burger King's, where a guy sings ''I am Man,'' to the tune of ''I am Woman'' (sample lyrics: ''I'm too hungry to eat chick food'')? TGI Friday's, where a guy eats vegetables, drawing uncomfortable looks from his male pals? Or the one where a guy is embarrassed to be seen purchasing tofu, so he runs out to buy a Hummer as the words ''Restore Your Manhood'' appear on the screen?</p>
        <p>There are many more, but the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine has whittled them down to those three, which it says ''prey on men's insecurities and shame men for consuming low-fat, healthful items.'' The group is conducting an online poll to determine which of the three is the worst (pcrm.org.).</p>
