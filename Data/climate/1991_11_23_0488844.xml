        <p>It is an impossible job for which nobody is truly qualified. That said, Boutros Ghali of Egypt is an appealing choice as the next Secretary General of the United Nations. He meets the tests of character and experience, offsetting doubts that at 69 he is too old for a demanding five-year term. And since Egypt is both an Arab and an African state, he can bring new diversity to a post previously held by three Europeans, an Asian and a Latin American.</p>
        <p>It is nowhere inscribed that this was "Africa's turn" to fill the job. Yet the Security Council faced a rebellion if its five permanent members -- Britain, China, France, the Soviet Union and the U.S. -- ignored geography in submitting a candidate for General Assembly approval. Wisely, Washington supported Mr. Ghali in the vote on Thursday that ended a deadlock. The result took fair account of Africa's claims; if rival contenders from black Africa were passed over, so was the Dutch Foreign Minister, whom George Bush was said to favor.</p>

        <p>It is an impossible job for which nobody is truly qualified. That said, Boutros Ghali of Egypt is an appealing choice as the next Secretary General of the United Nations. He meets the tests of character and experience, offsetting doubts that at 69 he is too old for a demanding five-year term. And since Egypt is both an Arab and an African state, he can bring new diversity to a post previously held by three Europeans, an Asian and a Latin American.</p>
        <p>It is nowhere inscribed that this was "Africa's turn" to fill the job. Yet the Security Council faced a rebellion if its five permanent members -- Britain, China, France, the Soviet Union and the U.S. -- ignored geography in submitting a candidate for General Assembly approval. Wisely, Washington supported Mr. Ghali in the vote on Thursday that ended a deadlock. The result took fair account of Africa's claims; if rival contenders from black Africa were passed over, so was the Dutch Foreign Minister, whom George Bush was said to favor.</p>
        <p>If approved by the Assembly, Mr. Ghali will guide a world organization bursting with promise and problems. A flabby bureaucracy cries out for surgery as the U.N. copes with peacekeeping in Iraq, Cambodia, El Salvador, Afghanistan, Cyprus and now Yugoslavia. Every imaginable dispute, from human rights to global warming, crowds its agenda. Yet its coffers are empty.</p>
        <p>The U.N. needs a voice able to persuade and cajole, a sure-footed diplomat capable of taking risks. These are Mr. Ghali's strengths. As Deputy Foreign Minister he accompanied Anwar el-Sadat to Jerusalem in 1977, substituting for a Foreign Minister who had quit in outrage. From Camp David to the Persian Gulf war, Mr. Ghali has earned the trust of allies and adversaries. His easy humor and empathy reflect his own life as a British colonial schooled in France, and as a Coptic Christian whose wife is a Jew from Alexandria.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ghali was not hand-picked by Washington or the West, which will help his dealings with poorer nations fearful of being ignored in any "new world order." And since the Security Council surprised itself with an early decision, he can benefit from a month's transition before his respected predecessor, Javier Perez de Cuellar, retires.</p>
