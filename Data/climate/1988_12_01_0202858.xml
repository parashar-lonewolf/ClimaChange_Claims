        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Alcohol fuels: ''What's all the fuss about?'' Mobil Corporation asked this question in two advertisements that appeared in a number of newspapers, including yours (Op-Ed page, Sept. 22 and 29).</p>
        <p>Open the window, take a deep breath and read the morning newspaper: hostages, terrorism, oil imports, the trade deficit, the budget deficit, farm foreclosures, air pollution, acid rain, the greenhouse effect, leaking underground storage tanks and odd-even driving days. These are just a few examples of what all the fuss is about, and why there's a lot of interest in alcohol fuels.</p>
        <p>Mobil may wish we would forget these problems. But more and more cities can't forget when faced with the choice of cleaning up the air or losing Federal aid. Many states are turning to alcohol fuels as part of their answer.</p>
        <p>But wait, Mobil says. Cleaner air isn't everything. Consider the drawbacks.</p>
        <p>Alcohol fuel doesn't have drawbacks; it has opponents.</p>
        <p>Mobil says ethanol increases ozone. If Mobil would allow alcohol blending, the alcohol blends would cut ozone in the lower atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Mobil says alcohol fuels can't be competitive without government subsidies. If Mobil and other oil companies would pay the $14.6 billion ($52.61 per barrel) it cost to keep the Persian Gulf open for oil shipments last year, alcohol fuels wouldn't need a subsidy.</p>
        <p>Mobil says it takes more energy to make alcohol fuel than the fuel provides. The U.S. Department of Agriculture says the production of fuel ethanol has a positive energy balance.</p>
        <p>Mobil says there are times when the farmer is hard pressed to harvest enough crops. Ask farmers in my state and they'll tell you how hard pressed they have been for the last 10 years to find enough storage for the surplus grains our country is almost giving away at subsidized prices overseas.</p>
        <p>Mobil says alcohol fuels are dangerous when swallowed or absorbed through the skin. Has gasoline suddenly become a health drink?</p>
        <p>What is Mobil's real issue? The real issue is that Mobil explores, drills, refines, transports and markets crude oil, not alcohol.</p>
        <p>If both the President and President-elect of the United States, the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate, the White House Task Force on Regulatory Relief, Ford, General Motors, farmers, environmentalists, hundreds of independent gasoline marketers, the Legislatures of Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, Arizona, California and Minnesota, the Governments of Brazil, Argentina, France, Africa, Central America and Caribbean countries think alcohol fuels are the right way to go, why does Mobil think it is wrong?</p>
        <p>From a business standpoint, I can understand why Mobil would make a fuss about its loss of sales to a different product. Keeping our nation's economy and environment at risk is a tremendous price to pay for Mobil's self-interest.</p>
        <p>As a U.S. Senator, I am responsible to more than Mobil's bottom line. In short, what all the ''fuss'' is about is America's future. I am one of a majority of senators who will make sure there's a fuss about alcohol fuels. TOM DASCHLE, U.S. Senator from South Dakota  Washington, Nov. 17, 1988</p>
