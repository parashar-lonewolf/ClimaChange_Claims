        <p>EXPLOSION IN EDISON: 1 DEAD, THOUSANDS AWESTRUCK</p>
        <p>A natural gas pipeline explosion and fire that roared out of control for hours in the central New Jersey city of Edison sent 1,500 nearby residents fleeing in terror, leveled eight apartment buildings and damaged a half-dozen others, melted cars and lighted the night sky from New York to Pennsylvania. A1. EVERYONE HAD ONE THOUGHT: RUN</p>
        <p>When the explosion brought a sense of Armageddon to the sprawling Durham Woods Apartments shortly before midnight, the 1,500 residents did not know what evil had visited them. They imagined that it was a tornado, a plane crash, an alien ship from outer space, a hydrogen bomb or the final revenge of global warming. But they all had the same feeling: run. A1.</p>

A1. EVERYONE HAD ONE THOUGHT: RUN</p>
        <p>When the explosion brought a sense of Armageddon to the sprawling Durham Woods Apartments shortly before midnight, the 1,500 residents did not know what evil had visited them. They imagined that it was a tornado, a plane crash, an alien ship from outer space, a hydrogen bomb or the final revenge of global warming. But they all had the same feeling: run. A1.</p>
        <p>Victims began wrestling with how to reconstruct lives suddenly upended. B4.</p>
        <p>Relieved searchers checked more and more names off their list of possible casualties. B4.</p>
        <p>What caused the 33-year-old pipeline to fail is the subject of an intensive investigation. B5. NEW YORK CITY  GIULIANI OUSTS CRITIC FROM BOARD</p>
        <p>Mayor Giuliani has forced one of his critics off the board of the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation, strengthening his hand against potential resistance to his plans to reorganize New York City's municipal hospital system. He also informed another board member that his term will expire in 1995, not 1996. B3. YEARS LATER, MOTHER HELD IN DEATHS</p>
        <p>From 1964 to 1971, Waneta E. Hoyt had five children. All of them died before their third birthday. The authorities originally attributed the deaths to sudden infant death syndrome. But this week they decided to charge Mrs. Hoyt with five counts of murder. B2.</p>
        <p>The robbers who shot an out-of-town couple at a bridal boutique may have carried out other robberies on the East Side, the police say. B3. REGION  ADOPTION CASE WITH A TWIST</p>
        <p>The theater producer David Merrick, once the most powerful man on Broadway, sat quietly in the court spectators' gallery as his lawyer argued a case with a labyrinthine plot and an intriguing legal question: Can the 82-year-old Mr. Merrick, severely disabled from a stroke, be forced to become a father? B6. THE BUTTAFUOCO SOAP OPERA BEGINS AGAIN</p>
        <p>After serving four months and eight days in the Nassau County Jail, Joey Buttafuoco is free again to be with his family and cavort with the news media, the two groups that appear to be the most devoted to him. B6. TESTS FAIL TO FIND SOURCE OF DEADLY VIRUS</p>
        <p>Tests on blood samples from more than 60 people and 100 rodents in two states have failed to turn up the source of the hantavirus that killed a 22-year-old college student from Roslyn Harbor, L.I., in January, health officials said. B6. MEASURE OPPOSING FLAG BURNING PASSES</p>
        <p>The New York State Assembly approved a resolution urging Congress to propose a constitutional amendment that would prohibit the "wanton destruction" of the American flag. B6.</p>
