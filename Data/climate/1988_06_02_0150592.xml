        <p>LEAD: Robert R. McMillan, a Long Island lawyer and Republican fund raiser, announced his candidacy for the Republican Senatorial nomination in New York yesterday. He criticized the Democratic incumbent, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, for ''a lack of performance'' and ''ignoring the problems that confront the average family in this state.</p>
        <p>Robert R. McMillan, a Long Island lawyer and Republican fund raiser, announced his candidacy for the Republican Senatorial nomination in New York yesterday. He criticized the Democratic incumbent, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, for ''a lack of performance'' and ''ignoring the problems that confront the average family in this state.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McMillan, who is almost certain to be nominated by the Republican and Conservative Parties next week, said at a news conference in the Hotel Roosevelt that Mr. Moynihan's name was on just 15 items of legislation in the last 11 years and that 12 measures were routine commemorative and memorializing resolutions.</p>
        <p>The other three measures, Mr. McMillan said, dealt with tandem-trailer trucks, a new Federal building and a nuclear demonstration project. Mr. McMillan charged that ''Senator Moynihan is not responsible for a single piece of welfare legislation,'' despite his widely disseminated views on the problem. Partner of Dunne</p>
        <p>Mr. Moynihan, in New York to be nominated for re-election by the Liberal Party last night, said that welfare legislation originated in the House and would bear the name of a House sponsor.</p>
        <p>''If you don't know that, you don't belong in the Senate,'' Mr. Moynihan said. ''I'm not going to get into an argument with this guy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McMillan, 55, is a law partner of State Senator John R. Dunne of Garden City, L.I., and has raised money for Vice President Bush for three years. 'Wait Until Labor Day'</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's brother Jonathan, finance chairman of the state party, helped persuade Mr. McMillan to run after other Republicans, including Rudolph W. Giuliani, the United States Attorney in Manhattan, declined to challenge Mr. Moynihan, whose ratings in polls have been consistently favorable.</p>
        <p>He acknowledged the accuracy of such descriptions as uphill battle, mission impossible and little-known lawyer. But, he said, ''Wait until Labor Day,'' the usual starting point for intense campaigning. Mr. McMillan's sole previous candidacy was an unsuccessful race 24 years ago in Queens for the City Council.</p>
        <p>His government work has included being an assistant to President Richard M. Nixon, counsel to the late Senator Kenneth B. Keating of New York and a Justice Department attorney.</p>
        <p>Mr. McMillan has worked mostly in business. He was a lobbyist for the Mobil Oil Corporation and an executive of Avon Products Inc. and Abraham &amp; Straus before becoming a senior partner in the firm of Rivkin, Radler, Dunne &amp; Bayh.</p>
        <p>Mr. McMillan appeared at ease as he answered questions in his session, at which 21 family members, outnumbering reporters and photographers, surrounded him for photographs. He and his wife, a schoolteacher, have three children and live in Garden City. Mention of Issues</p>
        <p>He said that as a senator he would be ''somewhere between'' Mr. Moynihan and Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican. Mr. McMillan said he had the ability ''to articulate issues,'' as well as act on them.</p>
        <p>Mr. McMillan took a moderate to liberal position as he emphasized such issues as day care, acid rain, low-cost housing, retraining for welfare recipients and garbage disposal, which, he said, had become a crisis and should involve the Government.</p>
        <p>He would not to say whether he would seek the support of the Right to Life Party, the fourth-ranking party in the state. Mr. McMillan said he opposed abortions and favored restricting them.</p>
        <p>Although his firm has represented the Long Island Lighting Company in environmental cases, he said he supported the pact to prevent the Shoreham nuclear power plant from opening. He praised Governor Cuomo and Economic Development Director Vincent Tese for promoting the accord.</p>
        <p>Mr. McMillan said that Mr. D'Amato, who has been criticized by some Republicans for playing down party loyalty, had promised to be supportive, but that he could not expect the full support of many politicians ''until I start to close in the polls.''</p>
        <p>''I understand the club nature of the United States Senate,'' he said.</p>
