        <p>A3</p>
        <p>Turkish Flu Response Criticized  International experts said that while Turkish officials were taking appropriate measures, their initial slow response to outbreaks of avian influenza have created a health crisis that may be difficult to remedy.</p>

        <p>Global Warming as a Frog Killer  Scientists studying a fast-dwindling genus of colorful harlequin frogs on misty mountainsides in Central and South America report that global warming is combining with a spreading fungus to kill off many species.
