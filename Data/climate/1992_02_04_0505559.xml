        <p>Record levels of chemicals that destroy the earth's protective ozone layer have been measured above the Northern Hemisphere, a NASA-led team of scientists reported today.</p>
        <p>They said their preliminary findings raised the possibility of an ozone hole's developing this winter over populated parts of the United States, Canada and Europe, exposing people and plant life to higher levels of harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun.</p>
        <p>Using a new space satellite and high-altitude airplane flights, researchers said they had found exceptionally high levels of chlorine monoxide, a compound of chlorine that destroys ozone, over parts of Europe, Asia and North America. They said the area subject to increased ultraviolet radiation extended as far south as New England, Britain, France and Scandinavia. Harmful Effects of Depletion</p>
        <p>Scientists fear that depletion of atmospheric ozone as a result of human pollution will result in an increase of skin cancer, cataracts and impaired immune systems as well as disruptions in agriculture worldwide.</p>
        <p>The findings of the six-month multi-agency study were announced in a briefing at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's headquarters here.</p>
        <p>Although the chemical stage is set for an Arctic ozone hole similar to the one that appears over Antarctica each winter, scientists at the briefing said they could not predict precisely when it might happen. But they said they expected a dramatic decrease in protective ozone in the north to occur in this decade.</p>
        <p>"We believe now that the probability of significant ozone loss taking place in any given year is higher than we believed before," said Dr. James G. Anderson, a Harvard University chemistry professor who was involved in the studies.</p>
        <p>In addition, Dr. Anderson said, the studies found that chemicals that help deactivate ozone-depleting chlorine and bromine were at significantly reduced levels in the stratosphere above the North Pole. Dr. Anderson said the rate at which the atmosphere was able to recover from ozone depletion was reduced because of those low levels of helpful nitrogen oxides.</p>
        <p>"The immune system of the atmosphere is weaker than it has been before," he said, noting that nitrogen oxides check ozone depletion yearround.</p>
        <p>The layer of ozone from 9 to 30 miles above the earth is believed to be under attack by natural and manmade chemicals that drift up into the stratosphere. Destructive chlorine from chlorofluorocarbons, chemicals used in refrigerants and some aerosol sprays, and bromines, compounds from halons used in fire suppressants, are believed to be the chief culprits.</p>
        <p>Scientists, who have documented severe ozone depletion over the South Pole for five winters, have noticed smaller declines over the Arctic since 1989. Researchers do not believe ozone losses in northern regions, previously estimated to be about 10 percent at times during the winter season, will reach the levels of those at the South Pole because of differing atmospheric conditions.</p>
        <p>Data from NASA's Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite, launched last September, and aircraft taking part in the Airborne Arctic Stratospheric Expedition indicate that the atmosphere over the northern latitudes is primed for ozone depletion this winter, said Dr. Michael J. Kurylo, an upper atmosphere scientist at NASA.</p>
        <p>In January, he said, satellite instruments and aircraft measured levels of chlorine monoxide, a form of chlorine primed to destroy ozone in a chemical reaction fueled by sunlight, at up to 1.5 parts per billion, the most ever recorded in either hemisphere.</p>
        <p>Levels in this range are high enough to destroy ozone at the rate of 1 percent to 2 percent a day for the short, late-winter periods when a vortex of cold air that serves as an engine for the process is massed in the upper atmosphere near the North Pole, Dr. Kurylo said. If this Arctic vortex, which usually lasts through February and into March, remains stable and weather conditions are right, this rate of depletion could result in a 20 to 30 percent loss of the ozone over northern areas, he said.</p>
        <p>In the Antarctic, where the vortex of winter air lasts longer and is more stable, scientists have measured seasonal ozone depletion of 50 percent, he said. The atmospheric area of high chlorine monoxide concentration, and therefore of potentially greatest ozone depletion, was tracked by satellite during January, scientists said.  This raised the possibility of populated areas north of 50 degrees latitude being subjected to increased ultraviolet radiation for a time, they said.</p>
        <p>"We're not concerned with just remote areas now," Dr. Kurylo said. "What we're dealing with extends to very populated regions in the Northern Hemisphere."</p>
