        <p>LEAD: NEW research shows that acid rain may have contributed to the mysterious decline of black ducks in the last three decades and may be causing serious and widespread damage to the breeding grounds of many other water birds, according to a report released today by the Izaak Walton League of America, a private conservation group.</p>
        <p>NEW research shows that acid rain may have contributed to the mysterious decline of black ducks in the last three decades and may be causing serious and widespread damage to the breeding grounds of many other water birds, according to a report released today by the Izaak Walton League of America, a private conservation group.</p>
        <p>Although the research is preliminary and much of the evidence circumstantial, wildlife biologists familiar with the report said it was the first strong indication that birds as well as fish were suffering from the adverse effects of acid rain on the wetlands and lakes of eastern North America.</p>
        <p>''We now know that acid-stressed lakes do not produce many baby ducks,'' said Kathleen L. Fischer, co-ordinator of research on acid rain at the Canadian Wildlife Service in Ottawa. The Canadian Government has sponsored some of the studies described in the new report.</p>
        <p>Kenneth Ross, a biologist with the Canadian Wildlife Service, said that recent studies in the field produced a ''fairly reasonable correlation'' between acidified lakes and the decline of some fish-eating birds. Research is being conducted to determine the effect on other species, he said.</p>
        <p>In a foreword to the Izaak Walton League report, Frank C. Bellrose, a scientist with the Illinois Natural History Survey and an authority on North American waterfowl, said the new study ''presents alarming information that acid rain may be a real, and certainly is a potential, source of degradation for waterfowl breeding habitat.'' The report, written by Paul W. Hansen of the league's Upper Mississippi Regional Office in Minneapolis, concluded that the evidence suggested ''that an extensive regional fish and wildlife resource may be put at great risk by further delays in passing measures to control acid rain.''</p>
        <p>Most in danger, according to the report, appeared to be the black duck, a big, shy, dark-feathered bird with coral-red legs and olive-green bill. This duck is a familiar sight along the East Coast from Cape Breton to the Carolinas. But its number has declined by 60 percent since 1955.</p>
        <p>The decline has been attributed to many factors - increasing competition from other ducks, especially mallards; overhunting; human encroachment on habitats; the effects of ingesting lead shotgun pellets, which poison the birds and the effects of pesticides and other environmental contaminants.</p>
        <p>Now acid rain is also suspected as being a problem for the black duck. In part the suspicion is based on circumstantial evidence. According to the report, the breeding range of this duck coincides closely with the area of North America where deposits from acid rain are heaviest, and the decline of the black duck since 1955 coincides closely with the increase of acidic industrial emissions in this region.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the report noted, the black duck breeding season begins and the birds' nutritional needs are greatest in early spring when snowmelt surges into streams and lakes carrying the accumulation of the winter's acidic precipitation.</p>
        <p>One of the studies cited in the Izaac Walton League report was conducted by biologists at the U.S. Government's Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Maryland, where scientists raised black ducklings in experimental ponds with high and low levels of acidity. G. Michael Haramis, a biologist with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, reported that the mortality of ducklings raised on acidic wetlands was more than three times higher than that of ducklings raised on non-acidic wetlands.</p>
        <p>Another study, this one conducted in natural areas in Quebec by Dr. Jean-Luc Desgranges of the Canadian Wildlife Service, showed that young black ducks in moderately acidic areas grew at a rate 60 percent slower than those in non-acidic areas. Many of them starved to death, and many survivors suffered from malnutrition.</p>
        <p>The black duck belongs to the group of waterfowl known as dabblers. They sit on the water surface and pick up their food there, mostly insects, weeds, seeds and algae.</p>
        <p>In breeding season, black duck females eat more insects, mayflies and dragonflies, as well as snails and other invertebrate animals to get the protein and calcium needed for successful reproduction. Studies have shown that ducks on a protein-deficient diet laid half as many eggs as those on a normal diet. Ducklings in the first nine days after hatching also require high-protein diets.</p>
        <p>According to the recent studies, increased acidity in lakes decreases the abundance and diversity of the food species available to breeding ducks.</p>
