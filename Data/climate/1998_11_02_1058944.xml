        <p>International negotiators will resume talks on Monday in Buenos Aires over details in the treaty to fight global warming, but with their expectations sharply lowered.</p>
        <p>Last year in Kyoto, Japan, more than 150 nations hammered out a far-reaching agreement for steep reductions in emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases by industrialized countries in the next 10 to 15 years.</p>
        <p>They also agreed, in principle, to establish a system to allow the sale or trade of emissions permits between countries and to do more to bring developing countries into the effort, two key demands made by the United States. In theory, trading emissions credits would lessen the overall cost of reducing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by letting one country pay another to reduce emissions to meet global targets.</p>
        <p>But there has been little progress since the Kyoto Protocol was approved. And it now appears highly unlikely that an agreement on the details will be reached in time for the United States Senate to vote on ratification before the Presidential elections in 2000. The Kyoto Protocol continues to face substantial opposition among major American energy producers and consumers, who say it would be too costly.</p>
        <p>Treaty supporters in this country, acknowledging the slow pace of negotiations, have begun to emphasize steps that can be taken before mandatory emissions restrictions go into effect. They want Congress to guarantee that companies voluntarily reducing emissions of waste industrial gases believed to be a factor in global warming will receive credit for the actions when a treaty finally takes shape.</p>
        <p>Signaling the lowered expectations, Stuart E. Eizenstat, the senior American negotiator, cautioned that the Administration's first objective is to avoid what he called ''backsliding'' by other nations on the agreement that the United States brokered last year.</p>
        <p>In Kyoto, the Clinton Administration agreed to cut United States emissions over the next 10 to 15 years to a level 7 percent below 1990's emissions -- if international trading of emissions credits is allowed. That would let the United States meet a big part of its obligation by paying other countries to reduce their emissions more than the treaty requires.</p>
        <p>European nations are calling for limits on how much a country could rely on emissions trading to meet its treaty obligations. But Mr. Eizenstat said: ''I want to drive home as strongly as I can that we adamantly oppose efforts by the European Union or others to set arbitrary limits on trading. That is not consistent with either the letter or the spirit of Kyoto, and it would impose unsustainable costs on the U.S. economy.''</p>
        <p>After Kyoto, the parties to the treaty were also expected to work out what roles the developing nations would accept and what aid the industrial powers would provide them.</p>
        <p>Big developing nations are expected to overtake the United States in emissions of greenhouse gases sometime in the next century. But many developing countries still are resisting commitments to reduce their emissions until they see action by the developed countries like the United States, which produces a quarter of the world's greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>Some developing nations -- even China, which at Kyoto was skeptical of measures to increase the role of developing nations -- are said to be intrigued by the ''clean development mechanism'' included in the protocol. It would funnel money and technology to energy efficiency projects in developing countries, letting industrialized nations take some of the credit for the resulting reductions in emissions. But the details of this, too, remain to be resolved.</p>
        <p>Another source of delay is scientific uncertainty over how to count deforestation and reforestation in each country's contribution to the atmosphere's carbon dioxide. Growing trees absorb carbon dioxide, storing the carbon in wood and releasing oxygen. But the treaty partners will not decide how to score forestry until a science panel reports in about two years.</p>
        <p>In the next two weeks, negotiators are expected to do little more than to agree on a pace for further talks and studies.</p>
        <p>''I think a success at Buenos Aires would be a work plan and timetable,'' Melinda Kimble, Acting Assistant Secretary of State for International Environmental Issues, said at a recent briefing for foreign reporters.</p>
        <p>Christopher Flavin, an energy expert at the Worldwatch Institute, an environmental research organization, said: ''The Kyoto Protocol has been moving forward more slowly than most people had hoped for. The number of new, complicated issues added in the six months before the Kyoto Protocol was negotiated created a level of negotiating complexity that I fear has got us to the point that this protocol is in real danger.''</p>
        <p>But advocates are pressing industrial companies to reduce their emissions anyway. In Congress, a bipartisan group has introduced legislation that would guarantee that those who act soon will be given financial credits under any final agreement, whether it applies only in the United States or around the world.</p>
        <p>Last week, members of the President's Council on Sustainable Development, made up of industry, government and citizen groups, also endorsed steps to give credit for voluntary early actions to reduce emissions.</p>
        <p>Several big companies, including British Petroleum, United Technologies and Du Pont, have already pledged to cut their emissions and have begun to urge Congress to approve credits for early actions.</p>
        <p>Even industry groups like the Global Climate Coalition, which opposes the Kyoto Protocol, are supporting the Administration's insistence on unfettered trading. ''If emission caps are ever imposed, these market tools will be absolutely necessary to lessen high economic burdens placed on our citizens,'' said Connie Holmes, the organization's chairwoman.</p>
