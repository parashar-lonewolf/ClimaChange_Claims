        <p>Russian and American astronauts clambered out of the star-crossed Mir this morning and began a complex and potentially hazardous space walk to help restore the space station.</p>
        <p>Clad in a Russian-made spacesuit, the American astronaut Michael Foale was the first to venture through the hatch. He was followed by Anatoly Solovyev, the Mir commander.</p>
        <p>The purpose of today's operation was to find the hole punched in the Mir during a collision June 25 with an unmanned space cargo craft and undertake other repairs.</p>
        <p>The team's space walk was scheduled to last six hours -- enough time for the Mir to circle the Earth four times and for temperatures in space to soar to hundreds of degrees (when the Mir is in sunlight) and to plunge to minus 150 degrees (when the Mir passes into darkness).</p>
        <p>The space walk is to be quite elaborate. To move around the Mir, Mr. Foale will use a special crane to hoist Mr. Solovyev toward the damaged section of the Spektr module so he can search for a tear or puncture.</p>
        <p>Frank Culbertson, a senior NASA official, described the mission as being of ''moderate risk.'' ''We don't know yet, of course, what the holes look like and what repair procedures might be in the future,'' he added. ''But this is the first step in trying to gain that understanding.''</p>
        <p>If the hole, or holes, can be located, it would be repaired on a future mission, perhaps using equipment taken t to the Mir by the American space shuttle.</p>
        <p>Mr. Foale has had extensive training for the space walk, including practice in using Russian space suits. NASA officials said he had about 148 hours of ground-based training and another 44 hours of training in orbit.</p>
        <p>Still, every space walk is something of a venture into the unknown.  When American astronauts conduct space walks, they generally do so within the open bay of the space shuttle. And Jerry Linenger, the only other American astronaut to carry out a space walk in open space outside the Mir, has described his experience as unnerving, if fascinating.</p>
        <p>''The whole time it felt like I was falling from the edge of a cliff,'' he observed. ''It was a remarkable feeling, and you had to keep yourself under control and keep talking to yourself and saying, 'It's O.K. to be falling.' ''</p>
        <p>Beyond the psychological stress, the main hazards include mechanical problems, the risk that an astronaut's tether to the Mir might somehow come loose, sending him drifting out into space, or the possibility that one could snag his suit on a ragged portion of the Mir.</p>
        <p>Russian and NASA officials, however, say the dangers are manageable and the mission valuable training for the new International Space Station that is being built.</p>
        <p>Greg Harbaugh, a NASA specialist on space walks, said that Mr. Foale's space walk would help the Americans learn about the Russian space suit, safety practices and the disorienting experience of conducting a space walk outside the shuttle bay.</p>
        <p>To be sure, the crew of the Mir has already had more experience than they would have liked in making emergency repairs in space. Since the June 25 collision between the Mir and an unmanned cargo craft, life aboard the Mir has been a continual battle against breakdowns.</p>
        <p>The crew has already reconnected electrical cables that were disconnected after the collision. They have repaired oxygen generation systems and struggled successfully to stabilize the spacecraft after the Mir's computerized navigation system was inadvertently disabled.</p>
        <p>But there is still plenty left to do.</p>
        <p>Not all of the lost power has been restored because the crew has not been able to direct the solar arrays at the sun. They were to try to turn at least one of the four solar arrays on the module today. The team would also like to install a valve on the exterior so a new system for removing carbon dioxide can be connected.</p>
        <p>Then there is the problem of finding and fixing a hole, a task that has never been accomplished in space.</p>
        <p>The Mir crew began final preparations for today's mission by listening to a concert in the Grand Hall of Moscow's Tchaikovsky Conservatory, part of the elaborate celebrations of Moscow's 850th anniversary. The music was transmitted to the space station by ground control.</p>
        <p>They were instructed to go sleep by 7:10 P.M. on Friday and wake up three hours later. As a precaution, the flight engineer, Pavel Vinogradov, was to go to the Soyuz rocket docked along the Mir, as Mr. Foale and Mr. Solovyev passed through the hatch of the Kvant-2 module.</p>
        <p>Mr. Foale, who brought a camera and tools, attached a tether to a handrail on Kvant-2 so that he does not float away into space.</p>
        <p>After handing Mr. Solovyev his tools, he was to make his way over to the crane and use it to lift Mr. Solovyev to the cone-shaped area of the Spektr.</p>
        <p>There are two areas that the astronauts planned to check for damage. One is near an external radiator. The other is near the base of a solar array. The astronauts were to use special tools to look for rips in the thermal insulation and cameras and video recorders to document the damage.</p>
        <p>They originally planned to attach handrails on the outside of the Mir to  make today's mission and future operations easier. But Russian officials said that this part of the mission was being canceled to limit the spacewalk to six hours.</p>
        <p>The crew will also try to retrieve a radiation monitor attached to the Mir as part of a scientific experiment by Mr. Linenger during a space walk in April.</p>
        <p>Every step was to be monitored by the Mission Control Center here. The astronauts got a taste of how unforgiving their colleagues and the Russian media can be this week when the chief Russian coordinator of the Mir program put the responsibility  for the June 25 collision squarely on the previous Russian crew.</p>
        <p>The crew's allies in the Russian space program rushed to their defense and on Friday the crew -- Vasily Tsibliyev and Alexander Lazutkin --were rewarded with plots of land, medals and free mobile telephones.</p>
        <p>Still, the pain of the controversy lingered. The June 25 accident, Mr. Tsibliyev insisted at his award ceremony ''came unexpectedly and was not the responsibility of any one man.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 8, 1997, Monday</p>
        <p>An article on Saturday about a spacewalk from the Mir space station misidentified a Russian astronaut. He is Anatoly Solovyov, not Vladimir Solovyov, no relation, who is a Russian space official.</p>
