        <p>The continuing controversy over President Clinton's pardons of Marc Rich and others has placed leaders of the Democratic Party in a quandary. In some ways, the last few weeks have been harder on Mr. Clinton's supporters than even the battle over impeachment. Some have strongly criticized his pardon decisions, and many were embarrassed by questions over gift-taking as he and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton left the White House.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Clinton's legacy of economic prosperity and his record on welfare reform, the environment and civil rights remain central to the Democratic agenda. The Op-Ed Page asked prominent Democrats and political commentators how the party can refashion its message, regain the public's trust on ethical issues and position itself to become the majority party in Congress in two years.</p>
        <p>Robert B. Reich, secretary of labor under President Bill Clinton and author of ''The Future of Success.''</p>
        <p>The seemingly interminable Clinton scandals are not the Democrats' biggest problem, and merely distancing themselves from Bill Clinton (or Hillary Rodham Clinton) won't restore the party's soul.</p>
        <p>The Democratic establishment in Washington is no longer connected to the grass roots. The national party is nothing but a fund-raising machine. Terry McAuliffe, head of the Democratic National Committee, is distinguished mostly by his ability to wrestle dollars from donors. The Democratic Leadership Council is distinguished mostly by its opposition to organized labor. Congressional Democrats who flock to the vacuous ''center'' of a rightward-creeping agenda lack the courage of any strong conviction.</p>
        <p>Yet strong conviction is exactly what's needed. Three million more Americans voted for Al Gore or Ralph Nader than voted for George W. Bush. Most Americans don't want a giant tax cut for the rich. They'd prefer health care, good schools and quality child care for all; stronger Social Security; and a tax cut mostly for men and women of modest means.</p>
        <p>They don't want a giant missile defense against the world; they'd rather join the world in slowing global warming and reducing global poverty.</p>
        <p>A third party won't get there. (Nader was a disaster.) But neither will the poll-driven, money-grubbing Democratic establishment in Washington. Reviving the Democratic Party will require rebuilding a party rooted in our communities and fiercely opposed to what the Republicans are pushing. In short, a political movement that inspires Democrats to be the party of the people who have been left out.</p>
        <p>Kevin Phillips, author of ''The Cousins' Wars: Religion, Politics, and the Triumph of Anglo-America.''</p>
        <p>The tacky side of Bill Clinton outweighed his achievements last November, and the balance keeps worsening. Quiet but serious Democratic exorcism is in order. Ralph Nader was right about the Democratic Party losing its soul to big donors and corporate money. The party needs to reclaim the legacy of Jefferson, Jackson, Franklin Roosevelt and Truman.</p>
        <p>The two Democratic presidential nominees to lose to the Bushes -- Michael Dukakis and Albert Gore -- were both centrist, technocratic policy wonks with Harvard degrees. Enough said.</p>
        <p>The most important Clinton legacy may be 1993-2000 as a prosperity period between two Bush recessions. No other legacy is more important to burnish. Historically, the G.O.P.'s vulnerability comes when a major economic downturn and the bursting of a speculative bubble catch the party in top-one-percent partying mode -- for example, upper-bracket tax cuts, glorying in globalization, fat-cat fund-raising. The near future could prove to be such a period of vulnerability. On top of which, our first-ever Restoration -- the quirky, risky selection of the previous Republican president's eldest son to establish the dynasty -- doubles the stakes of a G.O.P. failure.</p>
        <p>Maynard Jackson, national development chairman of the Democratic National Committee.</p>
        <p>Our party must distance itself from tabloid politics and focus on the business of working to restore the grass roots of our party. Although former President Clinton is beleaguered right now, we Democrats cannot abandon the leader who brought us America's greatest economic expansion. Now we must concentrate our energy and efforts on the people in the precincts. Democrats have a proud tradition of people politics.</p>
        <p>Our Democratic Party is not an end; it is a means to an end. The end is a greater America -- where individual worth is valued and no person is left out; where every vote counts; and where ''inclusion'' is not a catchword, but is a passion. That must be our preoccupation, and that is our action plan.</p>
        <p>Geraldine Ferraro, former congresswoman from New York and 1984 Democratic vice-presidential nominee.</p>
        <p>The party should lie low and let the raging pardon fire burn itself out, as it inevitably will. When all is said and done, Bill Clinton will rise from the ashes and still be able to help Democrats running for office to raise money and get elected. Because of this amazing talent of his, his positive impact on the Congressional and Senate races in 2004 could be profound.</p>
        <p>But it's quite another thing for Hillary. She worked hard for 18 months to win the Senate seat from New York with very little help from her husband, and voters responded to her agenda. She leads a separate and independent political life from her husband. She's done the Washington press conference, which was necessary to respond to the revelations about her brother. Now she should go back to the voters around the state and start telling them what she's doing in the Senate to deliver on her promises. Only by successfully changing the subject will the senator be able to move on and be her own woman.</p>
        <p>Al From, founder and chief executive of the Democratic Leadership Council.</p>
        <p>For most ordinary Americans, the last eight years meant better jobs and higher incomes, more opportunities and less inflation, more work and less welfare, safer neighborhoods and better schools. As long as Democrats stick to the New Democrat formula that produced that progress -- furthering our party's first principles by modern means to tackle America's new challenges -- we'll retain the confidence of the American people.</p>
        <p>We must honor Andrew Jackson's credo of opportunity for all by spurring economic growth.  That means fiscal discipline, paying down the debt, expanding trade, and investing in education and new technologies. We must honor John Kennedy's ethic of civic responsibility by expanding AmeriCorps. And we honor Franklin Roosevelt's legacy of innovation by modernizing Social Security and Medicare for new circumstances and by expanding programs that empower citizens, like charter schools and community policing.</p>
        <p>So long as we keep our attention focused on solving the real problems facing people in their daily lives, the politics will take care of itself.</p>
        <p>Donna Brazile, 2000 campaign manager for Al Gore.</p>
        <p>As a Democrat, I believe my party has a future -- a future built on Bill Clinton's successes and beyond his disappointments.</p>
        <p>The immediate task is to renew the discussion that Al Gore began in the campaign: to fight for working families, protect and expand our prosperity and invest in improving education and cleaning up the environment. This discussion, which also included paying down the debt, support for a modest tax cut for the middle class and strengthening and saving Social Security and Medicare, was on the right issues and holds the right ingredients to put together another winning coalition in 2001, 2002 and beyond.</p>
        <p>So, it's time to let Bill Clinton go -- go on and live the rest of his life and allow a new generation of Democratic leaders to renew their fight on behalf of working families in America.</p>
        <p>Jesse L. Jackson Jr., Democratic representative from Illinois.</p>
        <p>The 2000 election revealed that Americans are united on goals but divided over means: they chafe at the constraints of a two-party system and the limiting philosophies of conservatism, moderation and liberalism. We need to reach beyond these constraints to achieve the goals of the people.</p>
        <p>In 1948, Hubert Humphrey said it was time for the Democratic Party to rise above states' rights and fight for human rights. Humphrey's insight has validity for our own time. Both candidates, and both parties, campaigned on providing every American with a good education and health care -- to ''leave no one behind.'' I believe public education and health care are human rights and should be codified as American rights in the form of Constitutional amendments. Fighting for these rights is a nonideological, nonprogrammatic and bipartisan way of uniting the American people, and both parties, around common goals.</p>
        <p>Dale Bumpers, retired senator from Arkansas.</p>
        <p>I well remember pundits predicting that the impeachment of President Clinton would wipe the Democrats out in 2000. The Democrats proceeded to win/lose (whichever you prefer) the White House and make significant gains in Congress.</p>
        <p>The investigations of the Clinton pardons are important, but to suggest that President Bush will get his program through in a cakewalk because of this issue is a stretch.</p>
        <p>The pardons have been soundly condemned by Democrats as well as Republicans, taking away party advantage. And it would be very surprising if the pardon story has a life long enough to distract the public three or four months from now.</p>
        <p>My own prediction is that once President Bush's programs hit center court, they will meet the same strong resistance they would have met had no pardons ever been granted. I know how strongly the Democratic Congressional leaders oppose them. More important, the American people always have a greater interest in matters that directly affect them, like income and estate taxes, education and medical care, than in a repeatedly hyped story on television. Democrats need to argue now that for the first time in our history, we are on the threshold of a golden age where affluence makes it possible to attack problems with solutions once thought unaffordable and to free our children of debt -- and that we must not fritter it away by adopting huge tax cuts. If Congress doesn't seize this opportunity, it won't be because the Democrats didn't make the case.</p>
        <p>Warren Beatty, movie actor and director.</p>
        <p>The Democratic Party has abdicated much of its soul to raise the money necessary to be elected. To regain its historic mission and activate its natural constituencies, the party must, above all, face the fact of its own culpability in the odor of the legalized bribery that constitutes the way we finance our campaigns. Why bemoan the Bush restoration if fund-raising has turned the Democrats into slightly kinder and gentler Republicans?</p>
        <p>The present discussion of bribery should focus less on detecting those we feel might be culprits under the letter of the law and more on favorable treatment exchanged for campaign contributions that now technically qualify as legal.</p>
        <p>Blackstone, in his ''Commentaries,'' says: ''Plato therefore more wisely, in his ideal Republic, orders those who take presents for doing their duty to be punished in the severest manner; and by the laws of Athens he that offered was also prosecuted as well as he that received a bribe.''</p>
        <p>How do we encourage honorable people to enter or remain in a profession in which success is so often achieved by dishonorable conduct? I hope the revelations of the last few days will dramatize for the public the dire necessity of having, and the high cost of not having, public financing of political campaigns.</p>
        <p>Nita M. Lowey, a congresswoman from New York and chairwoman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.</p>
        <p>Democrats can best move beyond this moment by drawing clear contrasts with Republicans on the issues. We must argue for a responsible budget that pays down the debt, provides a sensible tax cut for working families, and reflects our values. Over the past eight years, Democrats have been justly defined as the true party of fiscal responsibility and sound economic policy, and the American people acknowledged this last November when we gained seats in Congress and Al Gore won a plurality in the race for president. The challenge Democrats face is whether we can continue to articulate an agenda that keeps America on the path of economic prosperity by investing in our key priorities -- education and health care.</p>
        <p>Mario Cuomo, former governor of New York.</p>
        <p>The tsunami of media coverage unleashed by the Clinton pardons will be spent only when the current investigations conclude there is no provable criminal conduct. And that is likely. The suspicious conjunction of quid and quo -- gifts or contributions to politicians and decisions by politicians that favor the givers -- is an everyday occurrence in Washington and state politics, but rarely does it produce investigations, and even more rarely, convictions.</p>
        <p>This week President Bush will describe his program for America. Its most important piece will be a tax cut mostly for wealthy Americans that is dangerously large and will leave us inadequate resources to deal with our education, health care and debt problems.</p>
        <p>Distracted Democrats have already ceded much of the argument and are quibbling over the amount of the tax cut and who should benefit. As a result, they are in a precarious political position.</p>
        <p>If they give the president a clear victory in the tax cut debate, they may forfeit any real chance to win either house of Congress in 2002. What a sad mishandling of the political situation that would be. Al Gore received half a million votes more than Mr. Bush -- a statement of preference for the Democratic agenda.</p>
        <p>The Democrats have 50 votes in the Senate and are only nine votes from parity in the House. They  should forge a powerful alliance, supporting only a much smaller tax cut, one that benefits the working poor and middle class, and stay with their position until hell or the Republicans freeze over.</p>
