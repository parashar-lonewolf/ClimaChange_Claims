        <p>The first act of a major theatrical production opens today in the streets of New York, as thousands gather inside the Waldorf-Astoria for an exclusive event called the World Economic Forum, and thousands more muster outside for protest. Advanced billing for the spectacle, which has a limited engagement of five days, promises stimulating and perhaps even violent confrontation between good and evil.</p>
        <p>What distinguishes this drama is that no one will accept the role of evil antagonist; all of the actors claim to represent goodness, light and the best that the city has to offer. These players also know that they are performing on a world stage with a New York backdrop, where any aggressive act caught on videotape -- smashing a Starbucks window, jostling a doe-eyed protester -- will color their reputation for years to come.</p>
        <p>Then there is the delicate matter of respecting a weary and impatient audience: city residents for whom Sept. 11 seems like yesterday, for whom the trauma of the World Trade Center disaster is fresh. Every action and reaction, it seems, will be interpreted through the prism of ground zero -- every raised placard, every raised truncheon, every raised cocktail.</p>
        <p>And so the many sides have gone to great lengths to explain why they are doing what they are doing, and why the motivations of others are not in the best interests of either the city or humankind. The forum's organizers say they are bringing together the world's best minds to solve the world's worst problems. The activists say they are challenging the forum's motives with peaceful protests -- even puppets. The police say they are summoning thousands of officers to ensure the safety and civil rights of all involved.</p>
        <p>If it were all that simple, of course, then the city would be welcoming a love-in, not bracing for a Super Bowl weekend of conflict.</p>
        <p>The seeds for having the conference in New York this weekend were planted on Sept. 11, organizers say, when the forum's founder, a Swiss business professor named Klaus Schwab, happened to be in the city. Stunned, Mr. Schwab returned to Switzerland and proposed moving the annual event from its traditional location, the remote skiing village of Davos, to Manhattan as a demonstration of solidarity for a wounded city. (Critics of the conference say that the forum had actually worn out its welcome in Davos.)</p>
        <p>Representatives of the forum  talked of a move with Rudolph W. Giuliani, then in his final weeks as mayor. According to Charles D. McLean, the conference's spokesman, the mayor said: ''Great, welcome to New York.''</p>
        <p>As a result of that agreement, some 3,000 heads of state, political theorists, cultural figures and -- in particular -- corporate leaders will begin arriving this morning for five days of discussions on such sober topics as global warming, worldwide recession and the threat of terrorism. Mr. McLean said that the recommendations that emerge from the conference are worked on year-round by the forum's members and employees, and that its proposals had influenced the decisions of the world.</p>
        <p>He suggested that people who were not invited to the Waldorf this weekend should think of the event as ''a global town hall of leaders from different sectors of society.'' He said that members and invited guests ''come to our meetings because of a shared commitment to the forum's mission of improving the state of the world.''</p>
        <p>Among the many guests are the likes of Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu and Kofi Annan, the secretary general of the United Nations. But it mainly attracts the heads of international corporations who have paid about $25,000 for the chance to establish and burnish valuable business contacts amid all the somber theorizing.</p>
        <p>The forum also carries a certain egghead glitz: there are A-list gatherings at top restaurants; late-evening ''nightcaps'' with former President Bill Clinton and others; and tours of the city's sights, including, of course, ground zero. In one conference room at the Waldorf might be Secretary of State Colin Powell; down the hall, Peter Gabriel, the rock star who is listed in the roster of participants as ''Peter B. Gabriel.''</p>
        <p>Finally, the World Economic Forum brings protesters by the thousands: anarchists, socialists, environmentalists, labor unions. They see the forum as a sinister force, an opportunity for a small group of elite capitalists to carve up the world as though it were a pizza with everything on it. Many have protested peacefully at similar economic conferences in the past, often using acts of civil disobedience. But a few have had violent confrontations with the police, most notably in Seattle in 1999 and Genoa in 2001.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, the police and the demonstrators have monitored each other's preparations as best as they can, and have engaged in the kind of psyche-out posturing normally seen at a weigh-in for a boxing match.</p>
        <p>The police recently invited the media to watch a training exercise at Shea Stadium, at which police cadets, posing as demonstrators, disrupted mock motorcades and caused general mock mayhem. Activists complain that the police sought to frighten away protesters with the widely disseminated photographs of officers in riot gear.</p>
        <p>Some activists have been conducting training sessions of their own, in the techniques of nonviolent confrontation (although law enforcement officials say that mischievous diversionary tactics have also been taught). ''One thing we've found,'' said David R. Graeber, a member of an anarchist group called the Anti-Capitalist Convergence, ''is that if everybody sits down, you don't look threatening, and it's hard for the cops to come in and start slugging everybody.''</p>
        <p>On Monday, police officials held a no-nonsense news conference at police headquarters. The overall message they imparted was zero tolerance; any infraction of the law, no matter how minor, will lead to incarceration.</p>
        <p>In a way, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly played the ''good cop'' role. ''I think people are certainly distressed, you might say, as a result of Sept. 11, and there may be very little tolerance,'' he said. ''But we're here to make certain that these people who want to demonstrate do so peacefully. They have First Amendment rights; we are going to ensure that they are able to exercise those rights.''</p>
        <p>Then came Joseph J. Esposito, the chief of department, to fill the ''bad cop'' role. He said the Police Department was prepared ''for that small percentage that are bent on destruction of property or other things of that nature.''</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, representatives from several protest groups held a long news conference at the Community Church of New York, in Midtown, to express similar resolve -- although with nowhere near the precision demonstrated by the police. One of the many speakers was so nervous that she had to pause in the midst of denouncing the people who would be meeting ''behind the closed and heavily militarized doors of the Waldorf-Astoria.''</p>
        <p>They emphasized that they were interested in nonviolent demonstrations, and maintained that the violent outbreaks at previous economic conferences were blown out of proportion and mostly the fault of the police. They bristled at being asked, again, about vandalizing the property of large corporations. They said the tactic was used only rarely by a handful of people, and, as Mr. Graeber of the Anti-Capitalist Convergence put it, ''A lot of people may feel that this may not be the moment.''</p>
        <p>The moment, of course, is the first raw months after the terrorist attack of Sept. 11. But Eric Laursen, a member of Another World Is Possible, an umbrella organization, pointed out that he and many others who planned to protest were New York residents who shared the city's grief. He said it was an insult to suggest that protests for which city permits had been issued were somehow unpatriotic.</p>
        <p>Mr. Laursen said that a mother  had called to ask if a rally on Saturday would be safe enough for her to take her 14-year-old son. ''I told her it's not going to be one where we're running that kind of risk,'' he said. He said that the activists who sometimes destroyed property as a means of protest ''have assured us that they're not going to do anything to compromise our march and rally.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, police officers are hanging outside the Starbucks stores throughout Manhattan. Is it because of the rich coffee -- or because they know something? Call it dramatic tension.</p>
