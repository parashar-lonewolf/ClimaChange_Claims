      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial urges Senate filibuster of energy bill approved by Republican leaders, calling it barrel of pork for selected industries and campaign contributors, and says Congress must then come up with measure that will encourage development of alternatives to fossil fuels, source of America's dependency and global warming; says Sen Tom Daschle, Democratic leader, must rethink his support for provision mandating big increase in use of ethanol made from corn, expensive and environmentally dubious giveaway to Midwestern farmers who are already generously subsidized</p>

        <p>President Bush seems to have been the recipient of poor intelligence again. Last weekend, he claimed that the energy bill approved by Republican leaders would make the country ''more secure.'' Senator John McCain's description of the bill as a ''leave no lobbyist behind'' barrel of pork for selected industries and campaign contributors was closer to the truth. So was Senator Robert Byrd's unsparing judgment that the bill would ''do about as much to improve the nation's energy security as the administration's invasion of Iraq has done to stem the tide of global terrorism.''</p>
        <p>One can only hope for a similar show of honesty from 39 of their Senate colleagues, 41 being the minimum needed to sustain a filibuster and launch this dreadful bill into the legislative netherworld where it belongs. At that point Congress can start again and give the country an energy strategy worthy of the problems it faces, oil dependency being one, and global warming another.</p>

        <p>President Bush seems to have been the recipient of poor intelligence again. Last weekend, he claimed that the energy bill approved by Republican leaders would make the country ''more secure.'' Senator John McCain's description of the bill as a ''leave no lobbyist behind'' barrel of pork for selected industries and campaign contributors was closer to the truth. So was Senator Robert Byrd's unsparing judgment that the bill would ''do about as much to improve the nation's energy security as the administration's invasion of Iraq has done to stem the tide of global terrorism.''</p>
        <p>One can only hope for a similar show of honesty from 39 of their Senate colleagues, 41 being the minimum needed to sustain a filibuster and launch this dreadful bill into the legislative netherworld where it belongs. At that point Congress can start again and give the country an energy strategy worthy of the problems it faces, oil dependency being one, and global warming another.</p>
        <p>Both problems require fossil fuel alternatives -- not just environmentalists' favorite hobbyhorses, like wind and solar power, but biofuels that can take the place of gasoline. They demand vastly more efficient cars and trucks, as well as more benign forms of coal, the world's most abundant fuel. This bill takes baby steps -- a clean-coal demonstration project here, a hydrogen project there -- that pale next to the huge tax breaks and generous regulatory rollbacks it gives fossil fuel producers.</p>
        <p>The oil and gas companies were particularly well rewarded -- hardly surprising in a bill that had its genesis partly in Vice President Dick Cheney's secret task force. Though they did not win permission to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, they got a lot of other things, not only tax breaks but also exemptions from the Clean Water Act, protection against lawsuits for fouling underground water and an accelerated process for leasing and drilling in sensitive areas at the expense of environmental reviews and public participation. Meanwhile, the bill imposes new reliability standards on major electricity producers, but it is not clear whether it would encourage new and badly needed investment in the power grid.</p>
        <p>The responsibility for providing something better now falls to the Democratic leadership, in particular Tom Daschle. Mr. Daschle is one of several Midwestern senators drawn to a provision mandating a big increase in the use of ethanol made from corn. The ethanol mandate might be justifiable as part of a much broader and more aggressive biofuels program. By itself, it is an expensive and environmentally dubious giveaway to Midwestern farmers who are already generously subsidized. Though Mr. Daschle seems to regard their votes as essential to his political future, it is time for him to think on a grander scale.</p>
