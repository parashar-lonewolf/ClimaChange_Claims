        <p>POLYURETHANE is a relatively new finish that is gradually replacing traditional shellac, varnish and oil finishes. Polyurethane dries to a hard film that wears well. Since it dries faster than varnish, it is less likely to collect dust particles as it cures, so it needs less sanding and rubbing. Some craftsmen, however, say the tough, super-glossy finish has an artificial, plastic look that takes away from the natural beauty of wood furniture.</p>
        <p>When do-it-yourselfers try to buy polyurethane, they are often confused by the terminology on the can; ''urethane,'' ''polyurethane,'' ''spar urethane'' and ''liquid plastic'' are common terms. These terms are used by marketing departments in an effort to position their products. The terms are similar; they refer to products that produce the same type of finish.</p>

        <p>POLYURETHANE is a relatively new finish that is gradually replacing traditional shellac, varnish and oil finishes. Polyurethane dries to a hard film that wears well. Since it dries faster than varnish, it is less likely to collect dust particles as it cures, so it needs less sanding and rubbing. Some craftsmen, however, say the tough, super-glossy finish has an artificial, plastic look that takes away from the natural beauty of wood furniture.</p>
        <p>When do-it-yourselfers try to buy polyurethane, they are often confused by the terminology on the can; ''urethane,'' ''polyurethane,'' ''spar urethane'' and ''liquid plastic'' are common terms. These terms are used by marketing departments in an effort to position their products. The terms are similar; they refer to products that produce the same type of finish.</p>
        <p>Most polyurethanes are oil-modified formulas with a vegetable oil base (usually linseed, soya and safflower oils) treated with polyhydric alcohol and disocyanate. The chemical reaction between the oil base and other ingredients takes place in a large closed stainless steel container, at least 1,000 gallons. To avoid discoloration, the air in the container is evacuated and replaced with carbon dioxide; then heat is applied. The result is a concentrated resin that must be thinned with solvents and blended with additives to produce a workable product.</p>
        <p>While some manufacturers tout their products as being clear and non-yellowing, all polyurethanes will yellow to some degree over time. It is the oil base that will eventually turn yellow. Linseed oil will turn the deepest shade, while safflower oil will remain relatively light. Safflower-oil polyurethanes are therefore a better choice for furniture made of light-colored wood. Even thought it darkens more, linseed oil-based polyurethane produces a slightly tougher film than the other oil-based formulas and is a better choice for outdoor applications.</p>
        <p>High-gloss polyurethanes generally have a tougher film than the satin polyurethanes. That's because the satin finishes have silicate additives. The silicate particles in the film break up the reflected light and create a matte finish, but they also reduce the tensile strength of the film. Nevertheless, the satin finish is a good choice for most do-it-yourself projects because it hides minor scratches and imperfections in the wood surface, and it looks less artificial than the gloss finish.</p>
        <p>Polyurethane is called a build-up finish because, unlike lacquers, it doesn't dissolve and blend with the previous layer to form a solid film. As each layer is applied, it lies on the layer underneath. It is essential that each successive application grip and bind with the previous layer.</p>
        <p>Applying polyurethane is not difficult, but care must be taken to insure that the bare wood surface is free of wax, oil and dust. Wipe the surface clean with a rag moistened with denatured alcohol. Denatured alcohol is volatile, so keep it away from an open flame and make sure your work area is well ventilated. Allow the surface to dry; than wipe it with a tack cloth to remove any dust.</p>
        <p>Seal the wood with a sealer made of diluted polyurethane. The sealer soaks into the wood and allows the next coat to flow more evenly and get a stronger hold on the work surface. Most manufacturers offer a formula for sealer on the label of their product. Typical recipes call for diluting six parts of polyurethane with one part mineral spirits or three parts to two parts respectively. (Use mineral spirits if you are using oil-based polyurethane. Use water to dilute water-based polyurethane.) Always use regular mineral spirits, not odorless, to dilute the polyurethane; it has greater cutting power.</p>
        <p>To insure good adhesion, stay with the same brand of polyurethane. Different brands are not always compatible and the layers may separate and peel in time. Open the can and stir the mixture to blend all the ingredients. Don't ever shake a can of polyurethane; this will only add air bubbles that will show up in the final finish.</p>
        <p>Use a natural-bristle brush to apply oil-based polyurethane, and a synthetic-bristle brush for water-based polyurethane. Dip the brush in the finish. Avoid wiping the bristles on the rim of the can; this creates air bubbles. Then apply just enough to cover the surface. When the finish is applied, brush it again lightly with long strokes from end to end. This will remove brush strokes and drips.</p>
        <p>Some manufacturers suggest applying the second coat within four to six hours of the first. In this way, the first coat will still be soft enough to allow a good bond with the next layer. If you wait longer, the first coat will dry with a smooth hard surface; sand it lightly with 400-grit sandpaper. (Do not use steel wool, which leaves tiny particles that become embedded in the film.) The sanding will scuff the surface and provide a tooth to insure a good bond between the layers.</p>
        <p>Wipe the surface to remove any dust; then apply the final coat. Some experts think it is better to use a foam brush for the final coat because it creates a smooth finish without brush marks, but this is a matter of personal preference.</p>
        <p>Allow enough time for the finish to dry thoroughly -- at least 24 hours. Then examine it carefully for brush stokes, drips, and other imperfections. These can be removed by rubbing the surface with automotive rubbing compound then polishing compound (both available at auto supply stores), and finish the job by buffing the surface with a clean cloth.</p>
