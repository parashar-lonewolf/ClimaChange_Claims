        <p>"What we found is that the cheapest source of new power is conservation." Those words from a senior New York State energy official explain Gov. Mario Cuomo's laudable decision to cancel a $12 billion contract to buy power from a mammoth hydroelectric complex planned for Quebec.</p>
        <p>The project, known as Great Whale, was bitterly contentious. It would have provided New Yorkers with clean power beginning in 1995. It would also have turned a huge, unspoiled area of Quebec into a managed system of waterways and reservoirs, threatening the hunting grounds and livelihood of native Indians.</p>

        <p>"What we found is that the cheapest source of new power is conservation." Those words from a senior New York State energy official explain Gov. Mario Cuomo's laudable decision to cancel a $12 billion contract to buy power from a mammoth hydroelectric complex planned for Quebec.</p>
        <p>The project, known as Great Whale, was bitterly contentious. It would have provided New Yorkers with clean power beginning in 1995. It would also have turned a huge, unspoiled area of Quebec into a managed system of waterways and reservoirs, threatening the hunting grounds and livelihood of native Indians.</p>
        <p>Alarmed American environmentalists, led by William B. Hoyt of Buffalo, moved to block the deal. Mr. Cuomo based his reversal largely on economic grounds. He did not address the difficult question of whether New Yorkers should try to dictate environmental policy to Quebecers. Nor did he dispute the fact that the deal made environmental sense for smog-ridden New Yorkers. Hydroelectric power creates none of the gases that contribute to air pollution and acid rain.</p>
        <p>But the protests forced a fundamental question: Does New York really need the energy? The answer turned out to be no. One reason was the economic downturn after 1989. A more surprising finding was that New York's utilities had done a remarkably good job conserving energy. Instead of building new plants to meet demand, utilities have tried to satisfy that demand by getting everyone to use existing energy more efficiently.</p>
        <p>The Power Authority has spent millions of dollars encouraging high schools, police departments and municipal hospitals to use more efficient lighting, heating and air-conditioning systems. Investor-owned utilities, which would have bought 80 percent of Quebec's power, had done the same with their customers. By 1991, these efforts had begun to pay off. According to one study, New York's conservation-related energy savings are now close to double the national average.</p>
        <p>"Conservation competes very well when you give it a chance," one economist remarked after Mr. Cuomo's decision. That's a lesson California's inventive utilities learned years ago. It's a lesson New Yorkers are learning now. And it's a lesson, clearly, for the country at large.</p>
