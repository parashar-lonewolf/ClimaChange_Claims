        <p>HOLDING their noses, two model-pretty teen-age girls in bikinis shot down the matching Shotgun Slides and into the air before crashing into the water. They bobbed up to the surface, and it didn't matter that they suddenly looked like half-drowned rats, with their long hair tangled over their faces. They shoved the matted tresses back, gasping -- and laughing wildly.</p>
        <p>A few feet away, the line was 10 deep at the Ropeswing, and almost all male. A 10-year-old grabbed the rope and swung out, twisting into a mangled dive as he let go. A tattooed 42-year-old followed with a ridiculous belly bomb that raised a chorus of amused  ''eeeeeews'' from spectators.</p>
        <p>It was like that all day on a recent Saturday at Raging Waters Mariner's Landing, a water park along the boardwalk in the funky Shore resort of Wildwood.</p>
        <p>Most of the people who find their way to any of the region's dozen or so water parks go once or twice a summer to have some fun, cool off, jazz up a vacation or stop the kids from moping in boredom around the house. They form a constantly replenished stream of bodies that plummet down slides and zoom around twisting pipes on inner tubes or mats, feet first, head first, accompanied by an incidental soundtrack that blends  screams with the pop-rock on the public address system.</p>
        <p>But for a few hundred people, the workers, life in a water park goes on six or seven days a week, for 8, 10 or 12 hours a day. Like waiters in a restaurant, the water park employees occupy a parallel universe. While the visitors blast from ride to ride, or sack out on lounge chairs, the staff is buzzing around unobtrusively, coordinated by routine, rules and sometimes two-way radios.</p>
        <p>Some make sure that the water-moving machinery keeps growling, that the locker keys all work. Some are the meeters and greeters who take the tickets and shepherd the lines. And some stand in the sun for hours, watching a succession of bodies send up reverse cascades as they crash into turbulent blue pools, ready to drag out anyone who inadvertently discovers the fragility of the human body, the oxygen-dependence of the human lung.</p>
        <p>''Our goal is to deliver family fun in a safe, clean, friendly environment,'' said Denise Beckson, a remarkably level-headed 26-year-old who is the water park's general manager. ''The 'safe' and 'clean' is relatively easy. The 'friendly' is hard, after you've been here 12 hours.''</p>
        <p>Judge for yourself: Here is one day -- Saturday, June 27 -- in the life of a water park.</p>
        <p>7:20 A.M. Raging Waters opens at 9 A.M., but Ms. Beckson and a half-dozen supervisors are already gathering in the First Aid station/office for the normal morning meeting. Except this morning isn't normal.</p>
        <p>''People are going to ask,'' said Ms. Beckson. ''And the truth is, we just don't know what happened yet.''</p>
        <p>At 9 the night before, the rear axle on the Sea Serpent roller coaster on the Mariner's Landing pier had broken, bringing the ride to a sudden stop that cracked one teen-ager's tailbone and bumped, bruised and terrified the 22 other people on board.</p>
        <p>An alert went out on the two-way radios that the managers wear. Ms. Beckson, who was treating her lifeguards to pizza, dashed off to help. (By chance, one of the people waiting in line for the next ride was Will Morey Jr., the president of the family-owned company that built Raging Waters and the rest of the pier, not to mention much of the town itself.) Ms. Beckson has slept maybe three hours. The pizza boxes are still on the table.</p>
        <p>7:30 A.M. There are over a million gallons of water coursing through the rides, siphoned  at the beginning of the season from the city's pipelines and then filtered, treated and recycled. Water pours through some of the rides all night long to keep it filtering. The early maintenance crew turns pumps on for the remainder and backwashes the filters. William Ray Null, the head of maintenance, pulls out a skimmer basket and checks the overnight catch: bandages, lint, bits of pool paint, hair, fake fingernails, straws, an M&amp;M wrapper.</p>
        <p>7:35 A.M. Ms. Beckson and her crew drill.  One plays victim in a pool and the others save her over and over again, immobilizing her neck, giving her mock artificial respiration. Every guard and every supervisor goes through this at least once a week.</p>
        <p>''We try to make this as realistic as possible,'' Ms. Beckson says, ''so we'll be ready if something real goes down.''</p>
        <p>8 A.M. The supervisors head off to inspect the rides and dive their pools. John Famiano, a 22-year-old from North Cape May, tests little plastic tubes of water for chemical levels. Every two hours, he does it again. It's a backup: electronic monitors constantly adjust the bromine (similar to chlorine), and the pH level, by feeding in spurts of carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>8:30 A.M. About 30 guards in red shorts and white tank tops wend their way from the boardwalk onto the Mariner's Landing pier. It's a real pier, and at one time, the ocean lapped up under it, all the way to the boardwalk, which is jammed with carnival games, T-shirt stores and taffy shops. But every year, the ocean brings more sand, stealing from the other barrier islands along the shore. Now, even at high tide, the waves break far in the distance.</p>
        <p>The water park occupies the easternmost third of the pier; the guards are used to trundling past the European-built ''dry rides'' on the western two-thirds, not just the broken Sea Serpent, but also the old rococo Venetian Carousel and the waltzing Teacups ride, in which the ''china'' is an authentic-looking blue Delft pattern.</p>
        <p>Amusement parks, a European invention, have been around since the 1840's, and started booming in the United States during the  car-crazy 50's. That was also the era of motels, and Wilbert Morey, the grandson of a Coast Guard carpenter, made a career out of building some 30 in Wildwood. The motels are still there, and gorgeously dated, with their Frank Lloyd Wrightish geometry adorned with curving grillwork, plastic palms and stylized signs. Mr. Morey and his brother, William, got into the amusement park business in 1969, with a fiberglass slide (still standing on Morey's Pier, a half mile north of Mariner's Landing) and a huge King Kong, later importing dozens more  rides from Europe.</p>
        <p>Water slides and wave pools, based on American technology, arrived in the late 70's, and the Moreys jumped on board right away and by the late 80's, they had created two full-scale water parks, both named Raging Waters, one at Mariner's Landing and one at Morey's Pier.</p>
        <p>8:55 A.M. Larry Loscalzo, 26, is the first guest of the day, and he's early. A portfolio assistant for a money manager in New York, he's alone. His wife, he explains, likes sleeping more than splashing. Kay and Charles Swanson arrive from Philadelphia with their 8-year-old grandson, Thomas.</p>
        <p>Four workers arrive with smiles and boxes and boxes and boxes of wristbands, marked for two-hour, three-hour or all-day sessions. Everyone waits for the opening announcement, but the lifeguards have to be in place, and George Rohman, Ms. Beckson's assistant, is still prepping Team Rage, as the guards are collectively known, for the roller coaster questions.</p>
        <p>9:04 A.M. Remy Wallace, 21, a student at Temple, picks up the microphone. ''Good morning, and welcome to Raging Waters,'' he intones. ''At this time, the park is officially open. Please read all signs before riding the slides and obey the lifeguards, for your safety and enjoyment. Thank you and enjoy your stay with Team Rage and Raging Waters at Mariner's Landing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Loscalzo heads to the Lazy River, a meandering circuit with a gentle current that pleases the very old, the very young and the very languid. Thomas zips off to the Ropeswing.</p>
        <p>Some guests pay $2 for a locker key. They get $1 back when they turn it in. About 30 keys a day don't make it back. Harry Reeve, a 54-year-old maintenance worker, spent an hour and a half replacing locks this morning. In more than a decade, he has not ridden a single slide. ''I got no time to be going down the rides,'' he says.</p>
        <p>9:40 A.M. Mary Beth Bryers, 43, follows her 13-year-old daughter, Elise, and Elise's basketball friends, grabbing a foam mat and climbing the seemingly endless wooden stairs to the Speed Slides. When the guard tells her it's her turn, she lies down, stomach to the mat, grips the front edge and shoots down a series of turns and whirls. Somewhere in the 20 seconds of the ride, somehow, she bangs her head.</p>
        <p>As she flies into the exit pool, blood is pouring down her face, but she has no idea. She doesn't know why the guard is pulling her to the side.</p>
        <p>Seconds later, Jack Ross, an army-trained emergency medical technician, leads her into the First Aid station and puts a tiny bandage on the quarter-inch gash by  her right eyebrow. Ms. Beckson gives her directions to a hospital where she'll get a stitch or two. ''The thing is,'' Ms. Bryers says ruefully, ''I can't go back in!''</p>
        <p>10:30 A. M. The thermometer is at 82, with a clear sky and a burning sun. (The day's high will be 88.) All the guard chairs are full, all the rides are being ridden. The only thing that will change from now until closing, at 7:30 P.M., is the number of visitors, which will total 2,000 or so by the end of the day.</p>
        <p>The guards rotate all day long, switching at least every 40 minutes. It helps keep them vigilant. Alexandra Jablokov, 19, yields her chair at the Shotgun Slides to another guard and climbs up to the top of the Sky Pool, a relatively gentle thriller that takes riders in inner tubes down a slide, into a pool, down another slide, into another pool, and so on.</p>
        <p>The day moves on fairly uneventfully. Rom Nardi, 70, comes through with a couple of new employees, university students from Holland. Mr. Nardi goes way back with the Moreys, and speaks with sad warmth of his old friend Wilbert, who died in January.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nardi hires several hundred people a year to staff Morley-owned snack stands, the dry rides and the water parks, and if there's one secret to making the whole thing work, it's his judge of character and his rapport with young adults. What other age group would have the necessary combination of energy and focus? And, for $5.25 an hour, what could draw them in these numbers besides the summertime company of hundreds of their peers?</p>
        <p>They are not just from Philadelphia, but also from Ireland, Scotland, England, Spain, Russia. Americans go back to school in September, when the piers are still bustling, Mr. Nardi says, but the foreign students stay till October.</p>
        <p>''We all hang out outside of work,'' says Katy Sullivan, 17, who works in guest services. ''No, I haven't met anyone special,'' she laughs, blushing. ''Not yet, anyway.''</p>
        <p>Geoff Rogers, the head of operations and Ms. Beckson's direct boss, walks through, admiring changes at the pilot house, where -- at his prompting -- Jim Kirk, the park's inventive carpenter, widened a door and lowered a counter for a new employee who uses a wheelchair. Mr. Rogers is the father of a newborn boy and a 14-month-old daughter, a bubbling, laughing blonde who was born with spina bifida, and endured 15 surgeries before she was 5 months old. He's already taken her on the Rocket Raft.</p>
        <p>''I expect her to do every ride we have here,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A couple of Wildwood police officers patrol the park. Earlier this year, the Legislature passed a law increasing fines for violations by amusement park operators. At the same time, they established fines for riders who ignore safety instructions. ''That law is, so far as I know, untested,'' said Mr. Rogers. ''It's not something we really want to have to use.''</p>
        <p>The Shipwreck Shoals, a special shallow area for the littlest children, equipped with tiny slides and gentle water cannons, is packed all day. It was the brainchild of Jack Morley, Wilbert's younger son, who, at 37, is generally regarded as the inheritor of his father's creative vision, just as Will Jr. is credited with Will Sr.'s acumen. Each son has two sons who eagerly ride the rides and splash the park and who may, perhaps, carry on the family tradition.</p>
        <p>''We have an insatiable desire to build,'' Jack Morley says. ''It's a very expensive proclivity.''</p>
        <p>Once or twice an hour, a guard plunges in to pull someone out, but it's all simple stuff. Leah Stuckey, 4, made it down the Rocket Raft just fine, but in the pool at the very end, she slipped right out of her life vest. Her sister, Sharell Vines, of Irvington, carries her around till she regains her courage. ''Are you all right now?'' Nod. ''Do you want to go on another ride?'' Nod.</p>
        <p>At 7 P.M., the public address system reverberates: one-half hour till closing. The pace picks up a bit. Some visitors dash around, trying to milk their last few minutes. Some start packing up.</p>
        <p>7:15 P.M. The soundtrack is Michael Jackson: ''Beat It.'' ''That song seems to come on every night at this time,'' says George Rohman, the assistant manager. The streams of people jamming the park all day are now rivers of departing guests.</p>
        <p>This is the hardest part of the day, says George Rohman, the assistant manager.  How do you keep the lifeguards focused on their jobs, not their wristwatches? The 15-minute warning goes out.</p>
        <p>7:20 P.M. Geoff Rogers drops by, telling Mr. Rohman to make sure the park's visitors remain welcome until the last minute. ''This should not be like, the lights are going out at Kmart,'' he says. Mr. Rohman nods.</p>
        <p>7:30 P.M. Mr. Rohman wiggles his finger and Dan Hartnett immediately announces, ''Ladies and gentlemen, the park is now closed.'' He manages to sound official, not relieved.</p>
        <p>Guards block the stairways to the rides; anybody in line can come down, but that's it. When the last rider is down, the guard at the top walks down the stairs, making sure no one is hiding.</p>
        <p>7:35 P.M. The guards cluster for the the good night speech. ''Great job, everybody.'' Mr. Rohman says. ''Just, in that last 15 minutes, don't let your guard down. And don't rush any of the guests to leave.''</p>
        <p>Dismissed, the guards make tracks, ready for their own fun: beer by the ocean, cookouts, movies.</p>
        <p>8:04 Mr. Rohman tromps up an exit ramp with one of the supervisors, Sarah Nessler, 19, pulling a gate closed behind them. ''And I'm going to come back and do it all over again tomorrow!'' he says.</p>
        <p>8:10 P.M. Or sooner. A trio of teen-agers from Bridgeton, Penn., stare at the empty slides and the pristine pools. They look comically bereft.</p>
        <p>They had bought a day pass to the entire Morey amusement empire about noon, and spent their first few hours at Raging Waters, during which one of them lost their locker key. ''I didn't lose it,'' protested James Holden, 16. ''The ride took it!''</p>
        <p>Then they headed out to do the dry rides.  ''Nobody said they was going to close,'' said Will Perez, 17. ''We come back and ain't nobody here!''</p>
        <p>They find a roving police officer, who finds Charles Dickinson, 23, the supervisor of the dry rides at Mariner's Landing. He radios out for Mr. Rohman, who, luckily for the boys, is still within range.</p>
        <p>8:20 P.M. Mr. Rohman returns, teases the boys gently, and makes them describe what he's going to see when he uses his master key to open locker No. 504. White shorts, a black belt, they answer. Nike socks. And they're right. With a jingling of keys, Mr. Rohman leaves again. This time, he really won't be back till morning.</p>
