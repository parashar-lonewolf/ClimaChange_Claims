        <p>LEAD: Leading conservation organizations called on President Bush today to review and reverse the Reagan Administration's decision to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling.</p>
        <p>Leading conservation organizations called on President Bush today to review and reverse the Reagan Administration's decision to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling.</p>
        <p>The organizations, joined by more than 100 local civic and environmental groups, also sent a petition to Interior Secretary-designate Manuel Lujan Jr. asking him to protect the refuge on Alaska's North Slope. That petition, and a letter to the President, said the Interior Department had gone ''well beyond the bounds of legality and propriety.''</p>
        <p>The conservation leaders said at a news conference that it was a top priority to preserve the refuge, home to many caribou, polar bears, wolves and other wildlife.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said in the political campaign that he favored oil exploration in the refuge. Mr. Lujan, as a Congressman, co-sponsored legislation that would have permitted oil activity there. Industry Issues Statement</p>
        <p>A statement by the American Petroleum Institute said: ''The issue of opening the plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration has been studied extensively, and the call now by environmental organizations for still more study is merely a stalling tactic and is unnecessary.''</p>
        <p>The environmental leaders said drilling in the refuge's 1.5 million-acre coastal plain, the last untouched stretch along the North Slope of Alaska, made no sense when scientists were urging less use of oil and other fossil fuels that emit carbon dioxide and contribute to a warming trend around the earth.</p>
        <p>''This request gives President Bush an early opportunity to fulfill his campaign pledges to protect the environment and to establish a sound energy policy,'' said Jay D. Hair, president of the National Wildlife Federation.''</p>
        <p>Michael Fischer, executive director of the Sierra Club, said, ''We hope President Bush will see, as we do, that development in the refuge is a short-sighted sacrifice of a national treasure for a few months of energy that is readily available elsewhere.'' Distortions Are Perceived</p>
        <p>The Interior Department has said that there is about one chance in five that a major oilfield lies under the refuge but that, if there is one, it could yield 3.2 billion barrels of recoverable oil, a significant amount.</p>
        <p>In their letter to the President and their petition to Mr. Lujan, the environmentalists said, ''The most egregious of the Department's violations of the law and of the public trust was its failure to produce an accurate, complete and objective report to Congress.'' It said that report, which supported the recommendation of Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel to lease the entire coastal area to the oil industry, presented incomplete data.</p>
        <p>The environmentalists say the report did not include new information about the impact drilling could have on wildlife and did not consider all reasonable alternatives, including energy conservation.</p>
        <p>Peter A. A. Berle, president of the National Audubon Society, said that improving the fuel efficiency standards of automobiles by one-and-a-half miles a gallon would save as much oil as would come from the refuge.</p>
        <p>While the Interior Department has recommended that drilling be permitted, Congress much give its approval under the Alaska Lands Act.</p>
        <p>Legislation to permit such drilling, as well as legislation to make the refuge a permanently protected Federal wilderness, is expected to be introduced early in the 101st Congress.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Interior Department said that Mr. Lujan is not responding to inquiries from the press.</p>
