        <p>Dr. Daniel B. Botkin, 64, a professor of biology at the University of California at Santa Barbara and the president of the Center for the Study of the Environment there, is one of the world's leading environmental researchers and has done much to popularize the concept of using yet maintaining the world's natural resources.</p>
        <p>''Discordant Harmonies: A New Ecology for the 21st Century,'' his 1990 book, published by the Oxford University Press, is considered by many ecologists to be the classic text of the movement.</p>
        <p>Q.  It's been a decade since the United Nations' Earth Summit meeting in Rio de Janeiro, where the term sustainability was heard early and often. In the 10 years since Rio, have you seen much movement toward that ''sustainable world'' that was heralded so hopefully there?</p>
        <p>A.  The good news is there is a lot more talk about sustainability than ever. The bad news is about people doing things sustainably: nothing much has improved. What's also discouraging is that a lot of concern has wandered away from a solid scientific basis for sustainability and toward empty verbiage. The term has become so overused that it means vastly different things to different people.</p>
        <p>Q.  Give us Daniel Botkin's definition of sustainability.</p>
        <p>A.  First, we have to look at sustainability of a product -- for instance, timber. That's different from sustainability of an ecosystem. A natural resource like a forest is sustainable if it can regrow at the same rate that you harvest it, for a defined time period. An ecosystem is sustainable if when you affect it -- perhaps through harvesting or humans' hiking through it -- it can still sustain itself through a defined time period.</p>
        <p>Q.  Despite the increased discussion of sustainability, material consumption in the United States has escalated. The trend in new houses and cars is the bigger the better. Is it your view that Americans are in a kind of denial about nature's finiteness?</p>
        <p>A.  It's deeper than that. Few human societies have ever restrained their use of resources if they had the technology to overexploit them. But a lot of pro-sustainability efforts are still possible in America without reducing the standard of living. Let's talk specifics here. If Americans want trophy houses and big cars, you have to talk to them about energy policy. There are sustainable solutions to the energy problem. There's plenty of solar and wind energy right now. The technology exists. It's ready. You can buy it off the shelf.</p>
        <p>Q.  So why do we see so little use of sustainable energy like the sun and wind?</p>
        <p>A.  Well, I can tell you in California, where there's push to do this, the power companies lobby and get little riders on bills that make it unprofitable for people to use solar energy or to go into businesses that would make solar energy devices. There's a lot of industrial and political inertia based on a fossil fuel economy.</p>
        <p>You have to break through that fossil fuel mind-set. When I talk to my friends in economics, they tell me that the conventional wisdom has it that solar and wind power are way off in the future and that nuclear is something we can use now. The facts are the opposite. So we have a cultural mind-set that drags us down.</p>
        <p>Q.  Do you see Americans as too affluent to incorporate principles of sustainability into their everyday lives?</p>
        <p>A.  I don't think that affluence necessarily leads to nonsustainable practices. Nor is the converse necessarily true. There are poor aquaculture farmers in Malaysia, who destroy mangrove swamps to make shrimp ponds that will last only two or three years. It's human nature to think of the immediate need first. On the other hand, in a developed country like Norway, people there are very sustainability-conscious.</p>
        <p>In terms of the United States, there's never been a movement for sustainability. You can't name a major political or cultural leader who has emerged as a spokesman for it. Sustainability is a much more fashionable word in international circles, in Europe, at worldwide centers like the United Nations Environment Program.</p>
        <p>Q.  How do you rate the record of the Clinton-Gore administration on issues of sustainability?</p>
        <p>A.  A big disappointment. There were so many ways they could have worked toward sustainability. They didn't.</p>
        <p>Q.  And would you give us your view of the performance of the Bush administration on sustainability?</p>
        <p>A.  I wish they understood global warming. I wish they had an understanding of the energy situation. They don't understand that the technology for renewables is here now, that nuclear is no solution, that we must stop depending on foreign oil and that we can solve energy problems by going to solar and wind power.</p>
        <p>Also, I think they are totally underestimating the importance of global warming as a risk. It has to be looked at in the same way you look at earthquakes and hurricanes. The question should not be, ''Is global warming happening?'' but rather, ''What is the risk of global warming happening, and what are the consequences if it does?'' You should act like you're buying an insurance policy against something you hope won't happen. The insurance premium would include reduction of greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>Q.  During the last 10 years, globalization brought wealth to corners of the world previously considered underdeveloped. Will these newly affluent countries be as profligate with resources as the United States and the rest of the industrialized world has been?</p>
        <p>A.  People have always been profligate with resources. But the facts here are clear. There aren't enough resources to go around for everybody to live at the level we in America live at. Somebody's going to have to give up something. But that's where we get into sustainable development in a meaningful way. One of the big questions of our time is, How can you have a good quality of human life, physically and spiritually that uses fewer resources per person?</p>
        <p>Q.  You speak of people needing a new mind-set. What exactly do you mean by that?</p>
        <p>A.  My belief is that we will not attain sustainability until we learn to love both nature and people. To love nature, you have to find a way to make a deep connection with it. If more Americans felt more connected to nature, they would feel a bigger stake in policies that cut resource consumption. They wouldn't be as defensive about scaling back on big cars or other wasteful consumer items; they'd want to do it.</p>
        <p>Q.  As the delegates to the World Summit on Sustainable Development begin their deliberations, what advice would you offer?</p>
        <p>A.  In the past, sustainability advocates have mostly talked about sustaining one product or resource. In these new times, I would hope that they turn their attention toward creating sustainable livelihoods in a context with ecosystems that are also sustained. We have to think about people and nature as one.</p>
