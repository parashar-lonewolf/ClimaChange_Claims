        <p>Iraqi Airline Opens Flight From Baghdad to Basra  An Iraqi Airways flight between Baghdad and Basra allows quick and safe passage between the capital and the city at the heart of Iraq's economy, making it perhaps the most significant in-country transportation development since the war began.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Law Strands Romanian Orphans  A new child welfare law passed in Romania essentially forbids international adoptions, leaving hundreds of families in Western Europe and the United States without children they had counted as theirs.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>U.S. to Send North Korea Food  The Bush administration said it would send 50,000 metric tons of food to North Korea this year, even as other American officials press ahead with plans to deprive the country of hard currency if there is no progress in talks over ending the country's nuclear weapons program.</p>
        <p>A3</p>
        <p>Calls for Iraq Pullout Plan  The top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee called for a shift in American policy toward Iraq, saying the administration must hold out the prospect of a major troop withdrawal unless Iraqis agree on a constitution by February.</p>

        <p>Air Force Pilot Dies in U2 Crash  The pilot of an American spy plane was killed when his aircraft crashed in the United Arab Emirates after completing a surveillance mission over Afghanistan, military officials said. It was the first crash of a U-2 flying reconnaissance missions in support of the military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>

        <p>Senators Investigate Dealings by Lobbyist  The Senate Indian Affairs Committee heard testimony contending that Jack Abramoff, a Republican lobbyist, and his associates defrauded several Indian tribes by charging them millions of dollars in fees and expenses to promote their gambling interests.</p>

        <p>U.S. Raids Marijuana Clubs  Federal agents executed search warrants at three medical marijuana dispensaries as part of an investigation into marijuana trafficking in San Francisco, setting off fears among medical marijuana advocates that a crackdown had begun on the sickest users of the drug.</p>
        <p>A12</p>
        <p>Study Cites Ohio Voting Flaws  A five-month study for the Democratic National Committee found that more than one in four Ohio voters experienced problems at the polls in last year's election, but the study did not find evidence of widespread fraud that might have contributed to President Bush's narrow victory there.</p>
        <p>A12</p>
        <p>Prostitutes' Patrons, Online  The Chicago police department began posting on its Web site the photographs, names and partial addresses of people arrested for soliciting prostitutes, in hopes of embarrassing offenders and deterring people from making such solicitations.</p>

        <p>Contraceptive Bill Passed  The New York Senate passed a bill that would allow pharmacists and nurses to dispense the so-called morning-after pill to women who do not have prescriptions. The Assembly has already passed the bill, which now goes to Governor Pataki.</p>
