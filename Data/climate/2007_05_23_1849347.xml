      <block class="full_text">
        <p>FOR decades, the Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies relied on word of mouth and personal relationships to maintain a client roster of the biggest corporations and to bring in new business. And it grew into the world's largest insurance broker.</p>
        <p>But two years after being staggered by accusations of rigging bids and taking kickbacks from insurance companies, Marsh &amp; McLennan has hired Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide, part of the WPP Group, to deliver a campaign of newspaper and magazine advertisements to run in publications including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, BusinessWeek and The Financial Times.</p>
        <p>The ads, which are also appearing in New York City on bus stop billboards and in subway cars, do not refer to the damage to the company that included the resignation of Marsh &amp; McLennan's chief executive, Jeffrey W. Greenberg, in late 2004. The company also paid $850 million to settle a lawsuit by the New York State attorney general in early 2005. But the tag line, ''Find The Upside,'' seems to carry a dual message that implicitly speaks to Marsh &amp; McLennan's recent problems while explicitly urging corporate clients to enlist Marsh &amp; McLennan's expertise as they wrestle with their worst problems.</p>
        <p>While its rivals were also accused of betraying the trust of their clients, Marsh &amp; McLennan paid by far the most to settle, and Wall Street analysts say that the other brokers have rebounded more quickly.</p>
        <p>Financial analysts and advertising executives call the Marsh &amp; McLennan ads an encouraging sign that the company is shifting from a defensive posture. And while the ads are more sober by far than, say, the ones that feature the Geico gecko and cavemen, the experts said they broke out of the mold of insurance advertising, which has often relied on fear to sell coverage for hurricanes or plant explosions or lawsuits.</p>
        <p>''They're trying to reframe insurance,'' said Barbara E. Kahn, a vice dean at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania who has taught marketing for 25 years. ''Insurance has always been a negative. The idea of turning the risk into a gain is an interesting idea.''</p>
        <p>The ads have been running since late April as full-page ads, some in sets of three pages. One opening page begins with the headline question: ''Climate Change Regulations, What's Your Upside?'' Another starts, ''Navigating China: What's Your Upside?'' A third says, ''Where There's a Risk, There's a Way.''</p>
        <p>Michael G. Cherkasky, who succeeded Mr. Greenberg as chief executive of Marsh &amp; McLennan a few days after the lawsuit was filed in 2004, said in an interview that ''Find the Upside'' is now ''the theme of the company.''</p>
        <p>As customers and senior brokers fled the troubled ship, Mr. Cherkasky seized an opportunity to trim the work force, which he has cut by 13 percent, to 55,500. He also developed the idea of offering a comprehensive approach to the problems of clients -- not just their insurance needs -- by creating teams of experts drawn from the company's separate consulting units.</p>
        <p>The Marsh &amp; McLennan umbrella includes a number of big names in financial services, from the signature Marsh insurance division to Mercer Human Resource Consulting to Oliver Wyman, a leader in general business consulting, and Kroll, which advises on security and corporate intelligence. None of the other insurance brokers can match Marsh &amp; McLennan with these broader resources, analysts say.</p>
        <p>The range of expertise, Mr. Cherkasky said, led to the team approach and to a proposal to address overall corporate risk. The goal is to provide strategies for handling risks for which no insurance policies have yet been invented, like the prospect of having crucial executives hired away or the potential damage to a company's image of taking on a project -- like drilling a new oil well, for example -- that could make money but draw criticism from environmentalists.</p>
        <p>The big-picture approach is often referred to as enterprise risk, and some analysts are skeptical that Marsh &amp; McLennan can pull it off successfully.</p>
        <p>Alain Karaoglan, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said it sounded like another form of cross-selling which, he said, ''is tough to do.''</p>
        <p>''It seems to make sense,'' he said, ''but I need to see the benefits in dollars and cents.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Karaoglan said the Marsh &amp; McLennan ad campaign is ''getting noticed'' and that ''on the margins it should be helpful.'' But, he added, ''it's tough to know what brings revenue to the brokers.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Karaoglan is recommending that investors buy Marsh &amp; McLennan stock -- but partly, he said, because he thinks the chances of the company's being taken over are increasing. Whether it thrives again or is bought, Mr. Karaoglan said, its stock price will probably rise.</p>
        <p>Brian R. Meredith, an insurance analyst at UBS, said the ad campaign underscored Marsh &amp; McLennan's hope of reaching into the huge middle market of companies with annual revenue of $500 million or less.</p>
        <p>''Marsh has historically dominated the large corporate accounts,'' he said. ''The ad campaign is not going to help there. The large corporations know Marsh. But perhaps as you move down to some of the middle market companies or smaller, the ad campaign might help with a little bit of brand recognition.''</p>
        <p>One of the main issues, Mr. Karaoglan said, is the cost of the ad campaign and whether that cost is offset by increased revenue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cherkasky said that Marsh &amp; McLennan was spending at least several million dollars on the campaign and that he regarded that as modest for a company with annual revenue of about $12 billion. But he declined to be more specific.</p>
        <p>Some companies routinely disclose their ad spending, and Marsh &amp; McLennan's reticence raised questions for Professor Kahn. She said her guess was that the company did not ''want a number associated with how much they're paying to mitigate the damage to their reputation.''</p>
