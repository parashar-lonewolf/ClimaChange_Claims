        <p>When President Bush announces on Monday that he will seek millions of dollars for new research into the causes of global warming, and will try to renegotiate an international accord on the problem, it will mark yet another example of how global and domestic politics have forced him to back away from the hard-line pronouncements of his first five months in the White House.</p>
        <p>In retrospect, those months will likely be known as the anti-Clinton phase of the Bush presidency. Eager to show that the national enterprise is under new management, the president and his aides reflexively reached for positions that could be cast as the opposite of whatever came before.</p>
        <p>Now, in the words of one senior administration official, ''the realities of governing have begun to overwhelm the memories of campaigning.''</p>
        <p>On the vexing question of how to deal with a bankrupt and paranoid Communist government in North Korea; on the tricky politics of bailing out economically failing but strategically important nations, and on the perpetual issue of when America needs to push along the peace process in the Middle East, Mr. Bush is suddenly trimming back, changing his emphasis, and, in the end, coming up with solutions that have shades of the ancien regime.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't say we are changing our views,'' one of his senior national security advisers insisted over the weekend. ''But it's fair to say that we are more careful in how we explain those views.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps so, but some officials say the change of tone also reflects an administration that is gradually learning the real-world complications of sole superpower status -- of what happens when allies push back, or demand American help. Mr. Bush himself, aides say, has been distressed by a stream of headlines and editorials suggesting that his call for a ''humble'' foreign policy is really camouflage for a president who expects the rest of the world to fall in line with his agenda.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush is hardly the first president to discover that a president's options are not quite as wide as they appear while savaging the other party during a presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>Bill Clinton came to office denouncing former President George Bush's policy on Haiti, only to discover during his first crisis there that it made some sense. He accused the elder Mr. Bush of coddling dictators in China, and later became a far more articulate enthusiast of economic engagement with Beijing than his predecessor.</p>
        <p>That experience taught George W. Bush to tread lightly on economic engagement with China.</p>
        <p>But during the presidential debates, the younger Mr. Bush lambasted the Clinton administration for unwisely bailing out countries that ran their economies into the ground, saying that such actions created a ''moral hazard'' -- market jargon for sending the message around the world that the United States would help bail out other countries that dug themselves into an economic hole.</p>
        <p>In the first two cases that have cropped up -- economic crises in Turkey and Argentina -- the Bush administration decided to vote for bailouts at the International Monetary Fund. (It rejected pouring direct American aid into those countries, as Mr. Clinton did in the Mexican crisis in 1995.) The White House said almost nothing about the bailouts. But one senior official said that during the key meetings on the subject, Mr. Bush's new team came face to face with the question of what chaos in Turkey would mean to the political alliance against Saddam Hussein of Iraq, and what a meltdown in Argentina would do to Mr. Bush's hopes for a free-trade area of the Americas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's statement on Monday on global warming, just a few hours before he leaves on his trip to Europe, is already shaping up as a classic example of saying the second time what the White House should have said the first time.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Bush rejected the global warming pact known as the Kyoto Protocol in March, he said the treaty was ''dead.'' His aides still think so -- the United States, they say, cannot abide a treaty that mandates reductions in American carbon dioxide emissions, especially at a moment that the administration is talking about building more coal-fired power plants to solve an energy shortage.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush's chief of staff, Andrew H. Card, said he was unhappy with how the administration conveyed that decision. So on Monday, Mr. Bush will announce that he agrees with a panel from the National Academy of Sciences that concluded last week that global warming was a real problem and that it was getting worse. He will ask the Commerce Secretary, Donald L. Evans to step up studies of the problem and announce his fidelity to a 1992 United Nations treaty that commits the United States to negotiating a solution with the rest of the world.</p>
        <p>No doubt that will not satisfy the Europeans. ''We just didn't have time to come up with specifics before the European trip,'' said one senior official involved in the cabinet-level review of the global warming problem. ''Our message will be that the only way to make this work is to come up with an agreement that can include the United States and developing nations.'' All that raises the question of why Mr. Bush failed to express a willingness to revisit the issue urgently two months ago.</p>
        <p>A similar issue surrounds the North Korea policy review. Mr. Bush used a visit by South Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung, to make the point that he did not trust North Korea's mysterious leader, Kim Jong Il. The statement left the impression that the new president thought it was a waste of time negotiating an accord with an untrustworthy Communist leader.</p>
        <p>The Republican right wing was overjoyed. Moderates, including former aides to the elder President Bush, were horrified, and began a lobbying campaign to convince Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, and her boss that there were not a lot of choices in how to deal with North Korea -- and that providing it with economic incentives to restrain its missile and nuclear programs made a lot of sense. Japan and South Korea said the same thing, and the European Union began to intervene, playing the role the United States once played.</p>
        <p>''It was inevitable that they would come out the same hole the Clinton folks did,'' said one senior career official involved in the announcement last week that, after a thorough review of Korea policy, Mr. Bush had decided to re-engage Pyongyang in talks on a wide range of issues.</p>
        <p>In the minds of many Korea experts outside the government -- and a few inside -- the decision put the new administration back to about where Mr. Clinton was in 1998.</p>
        <p>''The goal posts on issues like this are only so wide,'' said the senior official, a veteran of Asian strategic issues, holding his hands about a foot apart. ''You don't have as much running room as you think you do.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Rice defended the decision over the weekend, saying that ''two months ago there was a lot of skepticism about re-engagement, and the only way to make a decision we were comfortable with was to thoroughly review what was on the table. You need time. It doesn't make sense to proceed until everyone is comfortable with that decision.''</p>
        <p>Now, as Mr. Bush heads to Europe, he will have other opportunities to rethink early positions. The Middle East, where he sent Central Intelligence Director George J. Tenet last week after months of eschewing the use of special envoys, is likely to demand more of his attention. So are the Balkans. As one of his aides said this weekend, ''He's going to be making a lot of these decisions on the plane,'' between meetings with allies who are looking for reassurance that their views count, too.</p>
