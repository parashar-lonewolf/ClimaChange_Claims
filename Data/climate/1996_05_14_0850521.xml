        <p>IN 1993, six volcanologists studying the Galeras volcano, a smoky colossus in the Colombian Andes, died when it exploded in a riot of lava, ash and incandescent boulders, some flung miles high. A seventh member of the team gathering data in the crater at the time of the eruption lived to tell about it, though with a fractured skull, crushed ear, broken nose, broken jaw, broken legs and extensive burns.</p>
        <p>That lone survivor, Dr. Stanley N. Williams, a volcanologist at Arizona State University, now healed and armed with a new instrument, is headed for Popocatepetl, a 3.4-mile-high volcano 45 miles from Mexico City whose peak is covered year round by snow. El Popo, as it is called, shows signs of getting ready to explode, threatening one of the most populous regions on earth, as well as important ruins, like Cholula, site of the 40-acre, 230-foot Tepanapa Pyramid, one of the largest in the Americas.</p>
        <p>A main goal of volcanology is to learn how to predict trouble so that timely warnings can be issued for cautioning and evacuating people in the area. Scientists have devised many ways to spy on active volcanoes over the decades. Unfortunately, most of the techniques require close-up scrutiny. On average, one volcanologist dies on the job each year or so.</p>
        <p>Despite his close call, Dr. Williams is anything but ready to give up volcanology.</p>
        <p>"I'm going to work on Popo because it's an exciting opportunity to test this  instrument -- and because it demands attention," Dr. Williams said in an interview, pointing out that it was a huge volcano next to one of the biggest cities in the world.</p>
        <p>But as he renews his acquaintance with slumbering giants, Dr. Williams plans  to stay far from the volcano's rocky crater, which has repeatedly exploded in a  frenzy of blistering lava and ash over the centuries. In a way, he has learned his lesson.</p>
        <p>His new instrument works by reading volcanic gases from a distance, using a small telescope linked to a chemical sensor. During field trials, he hopes to analyze gases from the volcanic plume and detect symptoms of an impending explosion -- all from a relatively safe range of up to 20 or 25 miles. He can do the research as he travels around the volcano's base in a rental car.</p>
        <p>Even so, Dr. Williams cannot resist the temptation to get a bit closer to his quarry in a bid to compare the ground readings with those taken higher up. And so he also plans to fly his instrument aboard a friend's airplane, passing beneath the volcano's smoky plume.</p>
        <p>Peers of Dr. Williams applaud his dedication and say his approach has great technical merit. They also commend the work because it promises to save lives -- not only those of people who live near volcanoes but of volcanologists because it can potentially work far from the areas of greatest risk.</p>
        <p>"Gas measurements offer a tremendous amount of promise," said Bill Rose, a volcanologist at Michigan Technological University in Houghton, who works on such instrumentation. "Stan is trying to make them safe and reliable."</p>
        <p>With a hint of defensiveness, Dr. Rose added, of himself and all volcanologists, "None of us in this business are trying to get blown up."</p>
        <p>Popocatepetl (pronounced po-po-ka-TEH-pe-tal) is seen as a worthy object of study not only because of its current menace but because it has repeatedly proved its deadliness by devastating human settlements over the ages. In studying earthen samples and cores from its flanks, geologists have discovered that the giant has gone through three major cycles of eruption in the last 5,000 years, most recently from A.D. 675 to 1095.</p>
        <p>Such eruptions made the central Mexican plateau not only a dangerous place for early settlers, but, paradoxically, attractive as well. The rich volcanic soil was a bonanza for agriculture and fostered the rise of the region's sprawling pre-Colombian cultures.</p>
        <p>During the most recent eruption cycle, the smoking mountain (the meaning of Popocatepetl in the local language) spewed enough ash and lava and mud from melted snow and ice to all but bury a nearby town.  Claus Siebe of the National  Autonomous University in Mexico City, and three colleagues, writing in this month's issue of Geology, a journal of the Geological Society of America, suggest that the eruption destroyed the great ceremonial center at nearby Cholula, "essentially leaving the pyramids sticking out of a muddy wasteland."</p>
        <p>The decline from A.D. 800 to 900 of Cholula, probably the oldest continuously occupied town in Mexico, has long been an archeological riddle.</p>
        <p>Of late Popocatepetl has shown signs of entering a new phase of activity. On  Dec. 21, 1994, a minor eruption prompted Mexican officials to evacuate 75,000 people from its eastern flank, the site believed to be most vulnerable to disaster. Ever since, officials and geologists have labored to monitor its pulse more effectively, hoping to avoid mayhem.</p>
        <p>Among the monitoring techniques used routinely around the world, one of the best and least intrusive is to track the movements of hot magma beneath the volcano with sensitive arrays of seismographs that detect earth tremors. Once sensors are buried, they can be left alone while their signals are sent to a remote spot where scientists try to track the upward migration of magma, the term for molten rock before its release at the surface as hot lava.</p>
        <p>Such techniques can reveal trends but often fail to pin down specifics. For that, closer monitoring is often required. For instance, much can be disclosed by measuring cracks and swellings on a volcano's dome and flanks.</p>
        <p>One of the newest predictive tools is the tracking of changes in the composition of vented gases. Rising magma undergoes a huge drop in pressure. As  it does, gases once dissolved in it rapidly come out of solution, just as carbon dioxide fizzes out when a bottle of soda or seltzer is first opened.</p>
        <p>In volcanic magma, light gases like carbon dioxide and water vapor predominate at first. But if magma sits in a reservoir just beneath the volcano, getting relatively old and less likely to erupt, the rush of light gases is eventually replaced by heavier ones like sulfur dioxide.</p>
        <p>Over the years, geochemists have found many suggestions that monitoring the changes in vented gases is a good way to track the arrival of fresh magma -- and to warn of fast-rising danger.</p>
        <p>Recently Popocatepetl has been releasing about 10,000 tons of sulfur dioxide  daily, scientists calculate, indicating that a huge reservoir of relatively old  magma sits deep beneath its craggy rim. The question of interest to Dr. Williams and many other scientists is whether that enormous flow of hot gas is being joined by increasing amounts of carbon dioxide, indicating an influx of newer, more dangerous magma.</p>
        <p>The tracking of carbon dioxide from slumbering volcanoes usually requires that the sensors be placed in the plume itself by volcanologists who hike into the zone of extreme danger. What Dr. Williams is trying to do, with financing from the National Science Foundation, a Federal agency that sponsors basic research, is to develop the means to make such measurements remotely.</p>
        <p>"The big advantage is that I don't have to get blown up again," Dr. Williams  said. "I can drive or fly. It doesn't have to be close."</p>
        <p>The new instrument is basically a white box about a foot by a foot by 18 inches. Highly computerized, it collects light from the smoky plumes with its telescope and analyzes it for the presence of the carbon dioxide, which is revealed by a slight glow in the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum.  Because the device responds to emitted light rather than sunlight reflected off  the plume, it can work day and night.</p>
        <p>"It looks a little bit warm against the sky," Robert Dick, an official at Barringer Research, a company in suburban Toronto that is helping Dr. Williams design the instrument, said of the carbon-dioxide glow.</p>
        <p>So far, the instrument has been tested against plumes from electric power plants in Canada and the United States, which release carbon dioxide from burning fuels. The planned test in Mexico, to begin after Dr. Williams arrives this Sunday, will be the first volcanic surveillance.</p>
        <p>The plan is to drive and fly beneath Popocatepetl's smoky plume, comparing the readings underneath with those of the nearby sky.</p>
        <p>One challenge is to distinguish the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from that added by the volcano. Carbon dioxide in air naturally occurs at a level of  about 350 parts per million. Popocatepetl might add enough carbon dioxide so that the plume, after the dispersion and dilution that occurs as it drifts away, might give readings no more than 1 to 10 parts per million above that background level. An additional challenge is the haze of the central Mexican plateau, which is rich in carbon dioxide added from cars and factories.</p>
        <p>But if Dr. Williams can track the volcanic changes at a safe distance, he is  confident that he can help save lives, perhaps thousands of them.</p>
        <p>"It's a new instrument," Dr. Williams said, allowing that unforeseen trouble  might hamper its performance. But if everything works right, he said, he is confident that he can get about 6 miles downwind, and possibly 25 to 30 miles from the volcano to look for signs of trouble.</p>
        <p>"We know that the ratio of carbon dioxide to sulfur dioxide is going to be changing," he said. "We want to know the envelope of nature's noise," of the natural variation in the volcano's gases. And ultimately, Dr. Williams added, "we want to know when Popo is going out of that envelope and is ready to blow."</p>
