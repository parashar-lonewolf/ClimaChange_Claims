        <p>By day, the forest is the property of the Pacific Lumber Company, but by night it belongs to the radical environmentalists of Earth First.</p>
        <p>Under a cloak of darkness, small bands of men and women begin an arduous hike over steep ridges, their flashlights dimmed with blue filters to elude the timber company's security men. After a few hours of stolen sleep on the trail, they meet at midmorning in a clearing.</p>
        <p>In all, there are more than 70 intruders in ragtag camouflage fatigues. One man weaves pine sprigs into his epaulets to blend in with the forest. Instructions are whispered and then the eco-guerrillas of Earth First! (the group uses an exclamation point in its name) move out. Their target: Murrelet Grove, 222 acres of virgin redwood trees in Northern California where logging is under way. The objective: to stop the cutting by placing their own bodies in the path of Pacific Lumber's bulldozers and chain saws.</p>
        <p>Around 11 A.M. the Earth Firsters climb a steep slope into Murrelet Grove, named for a rare sea bird believed to nest only in virgin forests. The grove is deeply shadowed, with streaky beams of light penetrating the multilayered canopy. But the scars of logging are already to be seen: haul roads and skid tracks used by bulldozers to drag fallen trees off the hillsides.</p>
        <p>With whistles, horns and Indian war whoops, the Earth First guerrillas announce their arrival. On the ridge above them, several loggers in steel helmets look up in astonishment. In an effort to halt two men who are cutting apart a fallen tree, one protester shouts: "That tree may roll! You are endangering lives!"</p>
        <p>Suddenly, there is the angry growl of a bulldozer from above. It careens into view, pushing an avalanche of dirt before its steel blade. "Whoa," one Earth Firster cries in alarm. "What the. . . ."</p>
        <p>Many in the group back away from the charging dozer, but others stand their ground. The machine halts a few feet away, while a handful of protesters clamber onto the pile of dirt it has pushed up, challenging its advance. As the bulldozer retreats up the slope, the Earth Firsters race after it, seizing their victory.</p>
        <p>In Murrelet Grove, a bitter controversy over harvesting the last virgin forests has come to a head. Once redwoods as old as one millennium -- giant trees with moss-draped boughs -- carpeted the foggy coastal mountains of Northern California. Today less than 10 percent of this old-growth forest remains. Some three-quarters of the remnants are in state and national parks, while most of the unprotected trees -- on about 24,000 acres in Humboldt County --are held by the Pacific Lumber Company.</p>
        <p>Two initiatives on the California ballot this week could sharply curtail the harvesting of the old-growth redwoods. But the militant environmentalists of Earth First couldn't wait for the judgment of the voters. In June, they began a campaign of illegal protests, dubbed "Redwood Summer," to derail the logging. For its part, fearful of the initiatives, the timber company had crews out working six days a weeks to stockpile as many logs as possible. For both Earth First and Pacific Lumber, it has come down to a fight that is being waged grove by grove, tree by tree.</p>
        <p>In a forest hollow, the Earth Firsters rush to a redwood that is about to be felled. Some 30 people, forming two circles, link arms around the redwood's giant trunk.</p>
        <p>A logger, attempting to ignore them, goes about his job, making two small cuts with a chain saw. He raises his ax to chop out the wedge of wood.</p>
        <p>A protester named Dakotah Schrempp places his fingers inches from where the ax blade strikes.</p>
        <p>"Let me fall the tree," the logger, 60-year-old Doug Coleman, says in exasperation. But then Coleman sets down his ax. He knows he can't cut down a tree that's surrounded by human bodies. He tries to reason. "When you guys leave, I'm gonna cut this tree anyway," he says, "so why not leave now so I can do my job?"</p>
        <p>The Earth Firsters argue their case passionately: the forests are being overcut; at the current harvest rate, the ancient groves will be gone in less than 20 years, and loggers like Coleman will be out of work.</p>
        <p>"If we go your way, I'm out of work today," Coleman replies.</p>
        <p>"Go on strike! Don't cut old growth," pleads Schrempp, a 36-year-old activist from Louisiana. He hugs the trunk of the redwood, which is so big he can see the man standing next to him, and the man after that -- but no one else. Coleman, a logger nearly all his life, tells the tree-huggers this redwood was probably a sapling around the time of Christopher Columbus. When Schrempp hears this, tears spout from his eyes.</p>
        <p>Just then someone yells, "Deputies coming with handcuffs." There is instant mayhem. Earth Firsters scatter as furious loggers, along with the sheriff's deputies, give chase. One logger clamps a protester in a headlock.</p>
        <p>In all, 37 protesters are arrested on trespassing charges and taken into custody. Meanwhile, the loggers go back to work. Coleman cuts down not only the giant redwood but also many others, and by the end of the summer only about 30 percent of Murrelet Grove is still standing. EARTH FIRST IS A group that in no way resembles other environmental organizations. Frustrated with the political system, its followers take direct, often unlawful, actions, aimed at timber, mining and other development companies.</p>
        <p>As demonstrated in Murrelet Grove, the radicals have brought a degree of passion to environmental causes that more moderate groups, like the Sierra Club and the National Wildlife Federation, cannot match. To some mainstream environmentalists, the passion of Earth First is an inspiration. But others find it counterproductive, tarring radicals as irresponsible or, in some cases, eco-terrorists.</p>
        <p>In May, when two organizers of Redwood Summer were injured in their car by a pipe bomb explosion, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, working with police in Oakland, immediately accused the activists of making the bomb themselves. Further investigation left the Government in the embarrassing position of declining to bring charges for lack of evidence. The contention of the injured activists, Darryl Cherney and Judi Bari, that they were victims of an F.B.I. harassment campaign reminiscent of the 1960's drew more attention to Earth First than it had ever known.</p>
        <p>Claiming 15,000 members, Earth First is now one of the most visible environmental groups in the country. Its theatrics have landed on network newscasts and "60 Minutes"; an Earth Firster equipped with a cellular phone once gave live radio interviews while staging a sit-in in a tree, as a roaring chain saw threatened to bring him down. For sheer guerrilla theater, Earth First has outstripped even the anti-whaling commandos of Greenpeace, the one-time fringe organization, which now looks positively moderate. Earth Firsters say that's part of the point: their extremism allows others a bolder field in which to operate.</p>
        <p>At the same time, their real impact on the issues, the backlash they may be generating and their underlying philosophy -- which is far more revolutionary than many sympathizers may think -- have gone largely unexamined. THE OCCUPATION OF Murrelet Grove was billed as an act of civil disobedience. But Earth First is usually identified with something more serious: ecological sabotage. One of the group's co-founders, Dave Foreman, was co-editor of a book on the subject, "Ecodefense: A Field Guide to Monkeywrenching," which explains in devilish detail how to disable bulldozers -- by slashing hydraulic hoses or pouring Drano into the radiator. Other techniques include pulling up road survey stakes, toppling billboards and spiking trees with 60-penny nails that damage loggers' saws.</p>
        <p>Radicals call these tactics "monkey wrenching," in homage to the 1975 Edward Abbey novel, "The Monkey Wrench Gang." Earth First's covert image is furthered by the fact that it has no national officers and no offical enrollment -- the better to foil investigators. Since Earth First emerged a decade ago, acts of monkey wrenching have risen steadily. Last year, scores of incidents were reported in the Pacific Northwest, and there were at least 12 tree spikings in Northern California; nationally, the cost to the timber industry was as high as $25 million, according to Christopher Manes in his book "Green Rage."</p>
        <p>The mainline environmental movement deplores ecological sabotage. "I have no use for tree spiking and other tactics which in their ideal might look like a moral statement, but which threaten to harm people," says Doug W. Scott, associate executive director of the 620,000-member Sierra Club. "Individuals ought to take responsibility for the consequences of their political actions, but action in the night is on a slippery slope down toward terrorism, and that is a slippery slope that I abhor."</p>
        <p>Few radicals actually practice monkey wrenching, and not all agree on the need for it. But Dave Foreman, whose lectures, writings and seven arrests have made him the most influential leader of the movement, defends it. He considers it a desperate act in desperate times.</p>
        <p>"We're in a war," he says bluntly, "the war of industrial civilization against the natural world. If you look at what the leading scientists are telling us, we could lose one-third of all species in the next 40 years. We're being told that by the end of the century the only large mammals left will be those we choose to allow to continue to exist. We're in one of the great extinction episodes in three and a half billion years of evolution."</p>
        <p>Many Earth Firsters make a moral distinction between their actions and terrorist ones because they target only inanimate objects. They say they draw the line at causing harm to people. Yet the potential for injury does exist, as demonstrated by a 1987 tree spiking that seriously injured a California timber worker when his saw shattered. The episode was never officially linked to Earth First, which advocates that spikers mark their trees with a spray-painted "S." But not every spiker complies. The very need to promote a warning proves the possibility of injury.</p>
        <p>The controversy doesn't bother Foreman much. He can sometimes seem coolly indifferent to human well-being when measured against the fate of the natural world. "To me," he says, "the possibility that we could lose the last 5 percent of the ancient forest and the ecosystem it represents is far more frightening than possible injury.</p>
        <p>"It comes down to the point where if you give warnings, who's making which decision? We're saying, just leave the tree alone. It's a totally different thing than what we think of as terrorism. Just leave the goddam place alone. Don't destroy this ecosystem that's been around since the glaciers retreated."</p>
        <p>It's no surprise that with such rhetoric Earth First has caught the attention of law-enforcement authorities. In 1988, the F.B.I. succeeded in infiltrating one of its agents into Arizona Earth First, extensively bugging members and recruiting three informants. On the night of May 30, 1989, three Earth Firsters were arrested while allegedly blowtorching a utility tower in the desert west of Phoenix. The next morning, half a dozen officers, with drawn pistols and bulletproof vests, seized Foreman in his bed and charged him as a conspirator. Facing five years in prison, Foreman is scheduled to go on trial early next month. He vehemently denies the charges, claiming he has been targeted for a political reason: to send a message of intimidation to other radicals. BY DESIGN, EARTH FIRST has no Washington office. Most envrionmental radicals decline to work through the political system, disdaining the process of filing lawsuits, lobbying or even voting. They rally round a simple -- some would say simplistic -- slogan: "No compromise in the defense of Mother Earth!"</p>
        <p>Thus, for example, the group, with a straight face, proposes a Wilderness Preserve System that would encompass one-third of all United States territory outside Alaska. Earth First's mission, as one broadside puts it, is to "move out the cars and civilized people, dismantle the roads and dams, reclaim the plowed land and clearcuts, reintroduce extirpated species."</p>
        <p>But this no-compromise stance is criticized by other environmentalists as self-defeating. They contend that Earth First cannot hope to be a player if it won't take a seat at the table; the give-and-take of politics, even the necessity to accept temporary defeat, is part of the democratic process. "Of all the countries in the world, the U.S. has by far the most easily influenced Government," says the Sierra Club chairman, Michael McCloskey. "There's no sense in acting frustrated, like there's no recourse, when there often is a pretty good recourse if you're systematic and organized in how you go about it."</p>
        <p>Earth Firsters reply that in Washington and many state capitals during the past decade the political system broke down because public officials are in the thrall of development interests. Agencies like the United States Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management, which regulate timber, mining and grazing, are accused of failing to exercise stewardship over public lands. Even McCloskey concedes this point: "We have a sit-down strike by the Government on environmental issues. There's this great gap between what the public wants and what it's getting, and this is leading to a radicalizaton of the grass roots."</p>
        <p>This has played into Earth First's hands. The radicals have sympathizers in unexpected places. "Boy, I could probably put cement in a bulldozer," said one high-ranking staffer at a Washington environmental group, insisting on anonymity.</p>
        <p>Earth Firsters charge that environmentalists who let themselves be drawn into negotiations with public officials end up co-opted. They point to a compromise last year, brokered by Oregon's pro-timber Senator Mark O. Hatfield and reluctantly accepted by the Sierra Club, that released for cutting some 100,000 acres of old-growth forest in the Pacific Northwest previously protected from the chain saw by the courts. The accord incensed many grass-roots activists and led to defections from the Sierra Club. JUDI BARI LIES stretched full-length on a living-room couch, nerve damage and shattered pelvis making it extremely painful to sit up. Nine weeks after the May car bombing, the Earth First activist was released from a rehabilitation center, but her injuries will probably leave her permanently disabled. She has agreed to a meeting, though only at the home of friends; at the time she was in hiding in Northern California. Today she travels with a bodyguard, still fearful she may be a target of assassins.</p>
        <p>Activist insiders say it's absurd to believe that Bari could have knowingly had a bomb in her car, since Northern California Earth First has been moving away from environmental sabotage, or "ecotage," renouncing tree spiking and calling for nonviolent protest during Redwood Summer. Bari, 40 years old, is an assured and articulate speaker who, even before her near martyrdom, was one of Earth First's leaders.</p>
        <p>A former union organizer from the East Coast, she became a radical environmentalist while working as a carpenter in Mendocino County. Working on a house one day, she noticed the beauty of the knot-free wood used for siding. "Is this old-growth redwood?" she asked.</p>
        <p>"Oh, yeah," her supervisor said offhandedly, "this stuff's a thousand years old."</p>
        <p>"I was appalled," Bari recalls. "A light bulb went on: we are cutting down the old-growth forests to make yuppie houses! I was building a 25,000-square-foot mansion for a single man to use as a weekend retreat. It was so wasteful. I became obsessed with the forests."</p>
        <p>Earth Firsters, especially in Northern California, think of themselves as a tribe, and they have evolved their own life style -- more precisely, they've retreaded a quaint and familiar life style. In small towns among the redwoods, new-age settlers have appeared in tie-dyed wardrobes and dreadlocks. They work as carpenters, holistic healers, mandolin players, giving themselves names like "Sequoia" and "The Man Who Walks in the Woods."</p>
        <p>Within Earth First, these neo-hippies are known as the "woo-woo element." Their utopia is a concept called "bioregionalism," a vision of people depending only on what's locally grown or made. Timber and other natural resources would cease to be exported from their native region. Thus, Earth Firsters in Northern California are pushing for legalization of a major regional crop -- hemp, a form of marijuana that is also used for fiber products.</p>
        <p>"Something like Los Angeles," Judi Bari says, "which only exists because they're stealing water from another region, would not exist. Los Angeles is an ecological disaster."</p>
        <p>Bari is indifferent to the great hope of mainstream environmentalists in California, the ballot initiative nicknamed "Forests Forever" that would protect the redwoods. "I may vote for it, if I happen to vote," she says casually. "Earth First doesn't really work in the political system. We don't work in the legislative system."</p>
        <p>Which raises some questions: How effective can Earth First be in bringing about change? What role does the group play in the environmental movement, and does it make a difference? Answers to these begin to crystallize upon closer inspection of the occupation of Murrelet Grove, an Earth First campaign in microcosm.</p>
        <p>The Murrelet Grove activists were among some 3,000 people who heeded the call to participate in Redwood Summer, a name chosen to evoke the early-60's freedom riders of Mississippi Summer. By Labor Day, more than 150 Redwood Summer participants had been arrested. The Murrelet Grove protest was one of the largest "direct actions" of the summer, and yet it slowed down logging for barely an afternoon. It did not even generate the media attention that Earth First protests had in the past, since access to the woods required reporters to risk arrest. The demonstration got only a couple of paragraphs in local and regional papers. Overall, Earth First's Redwood Summer failed almost completely to stop logging activity.</p>
        <p>Measured in the short term, direct action usually does fail, and most Earth Firsters know it. The only lasting solutions to conservation of forests have traditionally come through new laws, lawsuits and land purchases. Earth First, while swearing off these kinds of actions, nevertheless concedes the need for other environmental groups to pursue them.</p>
        <p>And so, in a broader sense, there is no doubt that the antics of Earth First in the California redwoods have had an impact. In 1987, when the group first targeted the Pacific Lumber Company, owner of the majority of unprotected old-growth redwoods, none of the mainstream environmental groups was much involved. Pacific Lumber had doubled its rate of cutting to pay off junk-bond debts after it was acquired in a hostile takeover, and the company wasn't much interested in selling or donating its trees for parks.</p>
        <p>Through attention-grabbing actions, Earth First turned the fate of the grand old redwoods into a public issue. And into the fray they drew the Sierra Club and other more conventional environmentalists, who sued to halt the cutting until more was known of the threat to wildlife. With pressure mounting against them, Pacific Lumber and state officials announced a temporary moratorium this spring on harvesting the world's largest unprotected virgin redwood grove, a 3,000-acre tract known as Headwaters Forest. If the Forests Forever initiative passes this Tuesday, Headwaters Forest will be purchased with state funds and officially made a preserve.</p>
        <p>"It was the spirit of yahooism that led to the logging restrictions," says Marc Depolo, a longtime Earth First activist. "We stood up for the trees' right to exist. We've ended up where the Headwaters Forest is a statewide issue."</p>
        <p>In the Headwaters Forest at least, without Earth First trees might have fallen with no one to hear. ALL THROUGH THE Pacific Northwest, logging has been a subject of bitter controversy. As tree cutting reached record highs in the late 1980's, timber interests argued that the economy of the region depended on unlimited access to the old-growth trees outside parks and designated wilderness areas. In rebuttal, conservationists contended that, at the rate the trees were being felled, the old growth, mostly on Federal lands on the western slope of the Cascade range, would be gone in 10 to 20 years. These enormous trees, the conservationists also pointed out, are an invaluable habitat for salmon and the spotted owl, which this year made the threatened species list.</p>
        <p>The cause of the old-growth forests has become the leading conservation issue in the country. The impetus for the cause didn't come from mainline environmental organizations. It was largely the work of a plethora of obscure grass-roots groups, who, drawing on the research of the Government's own biologists, sounded the alarm. "This is an issue where the grass roots got going first, and the national groups were asked to come join," admits Frances Hunt, a Washington lobbyist for the National Wildlife Federation.</p>
        <p>Earth First, which erected its first illegal blockades to protect old growth in 1983, claims to have played a major role in the successful grass-roots campaign. But other environmentalists aren't so sure. They say that the contribution of the radicals was minimal, that -- apart from making lots of noise -- when it came to the unglamorous work of putting together the coalition necessary to exert poltical muscle, most Earth Firsters were nowhere to be found. "There's a big difference between Earth First actions and grass-roots activism," says George T. Frampton Jr., president of the Wilderness Society. "The real grass-roots activity in the last two to three years has been hard, not very sexy, and not very visible. It doesn't get on television.</p>
        <p>"If you read editorials now in the Northwest papers, you will see in almost every editorial the fact that, while saving forests costs jobs, we have to understand this area is in transition and jobs will be lost anyway. Most of the jobs are being lost to technological change. How do you think that argument gets on every editorial page? It's two and a half years of work."</p>
        <p>Earth Firsters argue that without a favorable climate of public opinion, mainline groups would not be able to influence politicians. The willingness of the radicals to put their bodies between the trees and the chain saws dramatizes the issue, they say, and taps public sympathy.</p>
        <p>To a degree this is true. But while Earth First has won sympathizers, the group's tactics have also alienated many people, particularly in timber country. Earth First's guerrilla theater has led to a backlash that threatens to undo even the small gains already made, such as Headwaters Forest.</p>
        <p>In the end, the spirit of Redwood Summer bore scant resemblance to that of Mississippi Summer, with its pursuit of high ideals. Marc Depolo, who, under the nom de guerre "Mokai," helped organize the Murrelet Grove takeover, conceded that its objective was not really to stop logging. "Mostly what we do is get in their face," he says. "It's almost personal. We don't like what you guys are doing, so we're going to come over and tell you."</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the loggers of Humbolt County took it personally. They felt they were being harassed, and they grew furious at what they saw as the arrogance of the Earth Firsters. In Northern California, the two cultures are bitterly polarized, with condescension, ugly words and sometimes even violence passing back and forth between them.</p>
        <p>Just as they'd expected, Redwood Summer demonstrators were the targets of physical abuse: one man was stripped and beaten; others were chased from a town meeting, and several had their heads forcibly shaved, supposedly for lice, in the Humboldt County jail.</p>
        <p>Earth First's aggressive confrontations succeeded in "getting in their faces." But as for saving trees, which ultimately requires a political solution such as the Forests Forever initiative, the tactic seems to have backfired. "I don't think it has been helpful, because it allowed industry to focus on Earth First and take the light away from the overcutting," says Gail Lucas of the Sierra Club, a prime mover behind the Forests Forever campaign.</p>
        <p>As the days dwindle down before the vote, polls show that the initiative, Proposition 130, is in trouble. The timber industry has mounted a $12 million ad campaign, cunningly implying that Earth First was behind the iniative, which it wasn't. "The polling shows that a linking of Prop 130 with Earth First can kill it," Lucas says flatly. "People do not like radical environmentalists." TACTICS ARE NOT the only way in which Earth First differs from groups in the mainline environmental movement. Its philosophy is also vastly different. Most Earth Firsters espouse a system of belief called "Deep Ecology," which holds, in essence, that a man has the same rights as a mouse. Human beings are not meant to exert dominion over the earth; all species have equal title to the earth's bounty.</p>
        <p>Though the theory has a certain noble simplicity, Earth Firsters have used it to arrive at some truly revolutionary conclusions. Our current technological culture is unethical, they say, since it permits humans to prosper while driving other species toward extinction. To protect the rights of trees and wolves -- and to save the human species -- we must be prepared to give up such planet-destroying extravagances as cars, televisions, planes and computers. A Luddite phobia of technology runs deep through Earth First, whose members have even opposed the University of Arizona's development of a telescope on a fragile desert mountain.</p>
        <p>In his recent book, "Green Rage," Earth Firster Chirstopher Manes argues that we must roll back more than just the last century of technology.  Manes calls the Enlightenment a "holocaust," because it was during that period that the intellectual distinction between man and nature was first made. Manes suggests that future societies be modeled on hunter-gatherer tribes, quoting one activist as saying, "Many of us in the Earth First movement would like to see human beings live much more like the way they did 15,000 years ago, as opposed to what we see now."</p>
        <p>Needless to say, few Earth Firsters actually practice Deep Ecology. Not many have given up their cars or unplugged their word processors. Even Dave Foreman, wearing a Hawaiian shirt and chomping on a cheeseburger in a Ramada Inn in downtown Tucson, Ariz., his home city, looks every bit the middle-class American he admits to being. "Certainly I recognize the contradiction in flying all over the country to give speeches about not doing that sort of thing," Foreman says casually between bites. "There are constantly contradictions."</p>
        <p>While the mainstream of the environmental movement is absorbed with issues like clean air, clean water and the greenhouse effect, the radicals of Earth First dismiss these efforts as nothing but attempts to preserve the high standard of living in advanced industrial society. For Deep Ecologists, the real hot-button issues are overconsumption and overpopulation.</p>
        <p>Foreman isn't sure how many human beings the earth could support in a society that gave equal rights to all creatures. But Arne Naess, a Norwegian philosopher who coined the term Deep Ecology, once suggested, in all seriousness, a target population for the globe of 100 million people.</p>
        <p>Such thinking has lead some Earth Firsters to view human beings as, in Foreman's words, "a cancer on nature." Indeed, Foreman goes so far as to argue that the United States ought to be closed to immigration. His reasoning is that an influx of people striving to live a middle-class life in America will deplete our resources faster than if they'd remained home in the third world.</p>
        <p>Foreman has also suggested that such human tragedies as the AIDS epidemic and African famines can be viewed as examples of nature healing itself. Rather than send foreign aid to Ethiopia, he once argued, "the best thing would be to just let nature seek its own balance, to let the people there just starve."</p>
        <p>Such views lead critics to label Foreman an "eco-fascist." He claims, however, that he is merely the bearer of bad news, not its advocate. "I don't think the earth can sustain this population of five and a half billion," he asserts. "People are going to die. It's not because I want them to. It's because they've overshot the carrying capacity of the planet. I really think there is going to be a major ecological collapse. There's going to be a concomitant die-off of the human population. The next 20 years aren't going to be very pleasant."</p>
        <p>Foreman speaks matter-of-factly, bloodlessly, as if all this were self-evident. In his youth, before he discovered Deep Ecology, he campaigned for Barry Goldwater and led a state chapter of the far-right Young Americans for Freedom. His stands today on immigration and foreign aid are in perfect sync with the archconservative positions of his past. He is a man at home on the edges, where the issues are always black and white.</p>
        <p>Even fellow Earth Firsters are concerned about Foreman's shocking indifference to human suffering, fearing that their leader has gone beyond Deep Ecology to advance the cause of other species at man's expense. Recently Foreman's anti-humanism precipitated a schism in the movement. A few months ago -- when some Earth Firsters in Northern California started to embrace such traditional political causes as labor reform in an effort, they say, to change society before it's too late -- Foreman resigned from the group he co-founded. He immediately announced plans for a new organization to focus narrowly on wilderness preservation. As one Earth Firster put it, "Foreman takes the mission of environmentalism at this point as a holding action while creatures wait for the demise of modern civilization."</p>
        <p>If environmental extremism has made an impact, it is by dint of the alarm bells it has set off. The calls of Earth First have not fallen on deaf ears. Environmentalists of all stripes share the anxiety that the life-support system of the planet is perilously out of balance, that we are running out of natural resources, while we choke on toxins and subvert our own climate.</p>
        <p>But a huge gap has developed between diagnosing the problem and prescribing the cure. Many environmentalists worry that the solutions of Earth First are so extreme, and often so merciless in their implications for present society, that people will be convinced the situation is hopeless. And that is something no environmentalist believes the earth can afford.</p>
