        <p>A2-8</p>
        <p>Pope Names American As Guardian of Doctrine  Pope Benedict XVI named the archbishop of San Francisco to be the guardian of church doctrine -- one of the church's most contentious posts -- and said he would speed up the process to make his popular predecessor, John Paul II, a saint.</p>

        <p>New Push for U.N. Nominee  The White House renewed its defense of President Bush's choice for ambassador to the United Nations, and urged the Senate to quickly confirm John R. Bolton, even as leading Democrats vowed to stall the vote until the State Department turned over certain classified documents.</p>

        <p>Uzbeks Demand More Freedom  A day of antigovernment protest, chaos and violence in Uzbekistan left at least 10 people dead and dozens more wounded. The protesters released no list of demands but accused President Islam A. Karimov of political repression and said they wanted more democratic freedoms and economic opportunities.</p>
        <p>A3</p>
        <p>Protests Rock the Middle East  Thousands of Muslims throughout the Middle East joined in rapidly spreading protests over the reported desecration of a Koran by American interrogators at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. In Afghanistan at least 8 people were killed, bringing the death toll over four days of rioting to at least 16.</p>
        <p>A3</p>
        <p>U.S. Battles Insurgents  Fighter jets flattened what the United States military said was an insurgent hideout on the fifth day of the Marines' 1,000-man-strong offensive in the western Iraqi desert near the Syrian border. At least one American soldier, four members of the Iraqi military forces and five civilians were killed in Baghdad and three other cities.</p>

        <p>Pentagon RecommendsClosing 180 Military Bases  The Pentagon recommended closing nearly 180 military installations and offices, including 33 big bases from Hawaii to Maine, in the first major restructuring of the nation's network of bases in a decade.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>The Pentagon wants to close the country's oldest naval shipyard, Portsmouth, which employs 4,800 people from Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts. Hundreds of shipyard workers rallied in protest after the announcement.</p>

        <p>Texas Library Goes Electronic  The University of Texas says almost all of its library's 90,000 volumes will be dispersed to other university collections to clear space for a 24-hour electronic information commons, a fast-spreading phenomenon that is transforming research and study on campuses around the country.</p>

        <p>Mayors Against Global Warming  Some 130 like-minded mayors have joined a nationwide bipartisan coalition to fight global warming on the local level, in response to the Bush administration's rejection of the Kyoto protocol.</p>

        <p>As Wall Cleanup Begins,Causes Are Assessed  As long ago as 1998, people in Washington Heights complained about the wall that collapsed onto both Riverside Drive and a stretch of the Henry Hudson Parkway. The cleanup has become a multilevel project, and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said that the city would recoup its cost once it was determined exactly who was responsible.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Execution May Be Exception  The execution of Michael Bruce Ross, the first inmate to be put to death in New England since 1960, was an aberration that is unlikely to lead to more executions in New England or the rest of the Northeast, several death penalty experts said. They said that his case was too distinctive to accelerate other death penalty cases or increase the acceptance of capital punishment in the region.</p>

        <p>Union Square Stagecoach Crash  A wild scene erupted in Union Square when a van hit the back of another vehicle, a stagecoach pulled by two horses, that was on its way to promote a new perfume. The horses broke away, sprinted down the sidewalk and ran amok in traffic before they were corralled.</p>
