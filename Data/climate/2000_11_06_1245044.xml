        <p>Bob Herbert's question regarding the dire consequences of climate change -- ''Is anyone paying attention?'' -- has justifiably desperate overtones (column, Oct. 30).

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Bob Herbert's question regarding the dire consequences of climate change -- ''Is anyone paying attention?'' -- has justifiably desperate overtones (column, Oct. 30). After all, we seemed to learn little from the energy crisis of the 70's; once oil prices dropped, so did our push toward renewable energy sources like solar and wind.</p>
        <p>Now we're getting a second chance; energy seems to be on everyone's mind. Presidential candidates talk about clean energy. Rising oil and electricity prices, coupled with deregulation, are front-burner concerns for policy makers and consumers.</p>
        <p>Scientific evidence about global warming has pushed the debate beyond the argument of whether it is for real and on to a hard look at solutions. The renewable energy industry is poised to go big time. Solar electricity, for example, could be shining on a million roofs by 2010.</p>
        <p>LINDA ANNE BURTIS  Delmar, N.Y, Oct. 31, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is director of N.Y. Shines, a solar-energy education campaign.</p>
