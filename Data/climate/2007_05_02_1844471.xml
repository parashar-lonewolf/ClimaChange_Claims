        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''Preserving Fossil Fuels and Nearby Farmland by Eating Locally,'' April 25, Jessica Prentice has it right: ''Eating locally is an interesting exercise.'' But if we are truly interested in a sustainable food system, we must consider the producer's point of view as well as the consumer's.</p>
        <p>From the producer's perspective, coffee, chocolate, vanilla, olive oil and wine are products that could not survive if they had to depend on local-only consumption. ''Locavores'' should understand that there's a difference between indulging in tasteless midwinter raspberries and supporting the efforts of indigenous farmers whose livings depend on offering their unique products to a global market.</p>

        <p>Removing jet fuel from the food chain is good for both the food and the planet, but allowing biodiversity to wither through benign neglect is not. To achieve a truly sustainable food system we must support both our own local agriculture and everyone else's.</p>
