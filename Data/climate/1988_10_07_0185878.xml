        <p>LEAD: Senator Dan Quayle, who claimed ''a very strong environmental record'' in the Vice-Presidential debate Wednesday night, received 20 percent out of a possible 100 percent on a ''scorecard'' on Congressional action on environmental issues issued today by the League of Conservation Voters.</p>
        <p>Senator Dan Quayle, who claimed ''a very strong environmental record'' in the Vice-Presidential debate Wednesday night, received 20 percent out of a possible 100 percent on a ''scorecard'' on Congressional action on environmental issues issued today by the League of Conservation Voters.</p>
        <p>Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate, scored 40 percent, above Mr. Quayle but below the average of 56 percent for Senate Democrats. The average for Senate Republicans was 37 percent. In the House, the average scores were 66 percent for Democrats and 35 percent for Republicans.</p>
        <p>The league, a nonpartisan political arm of the environmental movement, has already endorsed the Democratic ticket. It has also endorsed some Republicans, such as Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island.</p>
        <p>The league's scorecard, which it issues annually, rates members of Congress on their records regarding important environmental legislation. Quayle Defends Record</p>
        <p>Jeff Nesbit, a spokesman for Senator Quayle, said that, contrary to the league's report, the Senator had a long record of proenvironmental votes. He said the Senator had consistently voted to increase funding for clean air and water programs and for environmental programs generally. He noted that the Senator had opposed President Reagan's effort to reduce funding for sewage treatment plants from $18 billion to $12 billion.</p>
        <p>The league's scorecard is based on how members of Congress voted or otherwise acted on legislation affecting the environment, including clean water, acid rain, nuclear waste, energy conservation, timber cutting on public lands, endangered species and other issues.</p>
