        <p>Fair Trade Coffee  Producers of goods and services face a daunting range of potential ethical missteps: damaging the environment, outsourcing jobs, mistreating workers. But what about the ethics of Joe Consumer? Or, to take a particular case, a joe consumer. Your morning cup of coffee happens to be an ideological battleground over the ethics of the global economy. The world-market price of coffee has fallen so low that, according to a nonprofit called TransFair USA, millions of third-world farmers are being crushed by unfair competition and cannot survive. Coffee sellers who buy beans at the cheapest price are simply following the ruthless logic of markets: if they pay more, they have to raise prices -- and risk losing customers. But rather than agitate for some kind of international legislative solution, TransFair has devised a strategy that depends, ultimately, on consumer ethics.</p>
        <p>The idea is that if you buy coffee -- or other foodstuffs like tea, chocolate and fruit -- with a ''Fair Trade certified'' label, you know that farmers at the other end of the consumption chain have been fairly compensated. Since 1999, when TransFair started its strategy, sales of such coffee, which can cost twice as much as Folger's, have grown from 2 million pounds to a projected 27 to 30 million pounds in 2004. TransFair's president, Paul Rice, is justifiably proud that thousands of small farmers are able ''to put food on the table, to keep their families together'' as a result.</p>

        <p>Fair Trade Coffee  Producers of goods and services face a daunting range of potential ethical missteps: damaging the environment, outsourcing jobs, mistreating workers. But what about the ethics of Joe Consumer? Or, to take a particular case, a joe consumer. Your morning cup of coffee happens to be an ideological battleground over the ethics of the global economy. The world-market price of coffee has fallen so low that, according to a nonprofit called TransFair USA, millions of third-world farmers are being crushed by unfair competition and cannot survive. Coffee sellers who buy beans at the cheapest price are simply following the ruthless logic of markets: if they pay more, they have to raise prices -- and risk losing customers. But rather than agitate for some kind of international legislative solution, TransFair has devised a strategy that depends, ultimately, on consumer ethics.</p>
        <p>The idea is that if you buy coffee -- or other foodstuffs like tea, chocolate and fruit -- with a ''Fair Trade certified'' label, you know that farmers at the other end of the consumption chain have been fairly compensated. Since 1999, when TransFair started its strategy, sales of such coffee, which can cost twice as much as Folger's, have grown from 2 million pounds to a projected 27 to 30 million pounds in 2004. TransFair's president, Paul Rice, is justifiably proud that thousands of small farmers are able ''to put food on the table, to keep their families together'' as a result.</p>
        <p>Some people suggest, in fact, that consumer ethics are on the rise. In April, the consulting firm Wirthlin Worldwide put out a report noting that 82 percent of consumers it surveyed said that ''corporate citizenship'' has at least some influence on their buying decisions. Marc Gobé, a brand consultant and the author of a book called ''Citizen Brand,'' insists that a sea change is under way, partly because, he says, ''We live in a society where everybody feels guilty.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps. But here's another way to look at it: the United States imported 2.8 billion pounds of coffee last year. Even if you just look at premium coffee, which TransFair says is a 500-million-pound market, Fair Trade accounts for only 5 or 6 percent of sales. This is not a supply problem; Rice says that farmers who are already certified could easily produce three times as much coffee as they do now, which would in turn attract more farmers -- if the demand was there.</p>
        <p>And that's just one product. How many Fair Trade buyers also stick to free-range chicken? How many eschew all clothes or electronics made in unsavory conditions abroad too? How many are, on top of that, ''carbon neutral'' (or even know what that means)? The answer is, obviously, a lot closer to 0 percent of all consumers than 82 percent.</p>
        <p>In defense of the modern shopper, sorting out and taking sides on even a few issues would be a major undertaking. The Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit consultancy, helps companies promote ''sustainable consumption,'' which means producing things in ways that take into account all the consequences to society and nature. But getting consumers to think systemically is not easy; more immediate issues -- price, for example -- often guide day-to-day decisions.</p>
        <p>Rice figures that only a small percentage of Fair Trade buyers are motivated primarily by a desire to do good, ''even if it means a certain element of self-sacrifice.'' If Fair Trade goes mainstream, he says, it will be because of the larger group that wants great-tasting coffee and food but doesn't want ''to feel as if they're contributing to someone's misery.'' Gobé makes a similar point when he notes companies boosting sales by, say, supporting breast-cancer research. ''We want to do good, but we don't want to get out of the house,'' Gobé explains. ''A brand can help us feel good -- if you buy this yogurt, you don't have to make any other effort. You just buy it.''</p>
        <p>So that's it? We just buy ourselves some ethics? This seems to let us off the hook a little too easily. Yet Rice is optimistic. Maybe opting for the Fair Trade version of an everyday purchase is a first step. Consumers, he says, are a ''sleeping giant'' that could reconfigure markets by dint of their demands -- if they would only wake up and smell the coffee.</p>
