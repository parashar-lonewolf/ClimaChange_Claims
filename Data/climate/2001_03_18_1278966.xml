        <p>Just as environmentalists had begun to give President Bush credit for being willing to tackle global warming, he reversed a campaign pledge to seek to regulate power plants' emissions of carbon dioxide, a gas seen as a major contributor to the warming of the environment. Mr. Bush said a crackdown could lead to a surge in electricity prices, compounding what he referred to for the first time as an ''energy crisis.'' Environmentalists were also disappointed by administration signals that it would not fight lawsuits that seek to overturn Clinton administration rules putting a third of national forests off limits to development.</p>
