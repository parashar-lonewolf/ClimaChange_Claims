        <p>Speaking to a United Nations conference today, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo painted an ominous portrait of a looming environmental catastrophe and criticized the Bush Administration for not adopting European standards for controlling emissions of gases that warm the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>"It is absurd for this powerful nation to say that we cannot afford to curb the flow of greenhouse gases when they're building up like a blanket in the atmosphere, threatening eventually to melt the icecaps, to flood our coastal regions, to turn the world's breadbaskets into deserts, and convert the planet into a cosmic hothouse," Mr. Cuomo told the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development.</p>
        <p>The New York Governor said the United States should reduce carbon-dioxide emissions by the year 2000 to the levels of 1990. That standard has been set by many European nations in response to findings that the earth's ozone layer is deteriorating faster than was expected.</p>
