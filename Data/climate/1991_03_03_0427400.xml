        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was amused to read "Global Warming Is Politics, Not Science" (letter, Feb. 19), Richard S. Lindzen's critique of Leslie Gelb's illuminating column on global warming ("Sununu vs. Scientists," Feb. 10). Together with a handful of other naysayers, Mr. Lindzen is setting up a second career for himself: obfuscating the facts on global warming and portraying his doubts as representative of a broadly held scientific uncertainty.</p>
        <p>His defense of John Sununu, the Administration's final word on global-warming policy, demonstrates loyalty to his former Massachusetts Institute of Technology colleague, but doesn't square with the facts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lindzen's statement that only a handful of scientists are engaged in climate research belies the $1 billion, multiagency research program the Administration is fond of touting. Then Mr. Lindzen questions Mr. Gelb's assertion that "hundreds of scientists from dozens of countries" support the idea that the earth will warm. Where has he been?</p>
        <p>Last year, the internationally recognized Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued its science report, which stated unambiguously that "there is a natural greenhouse effect" and that man-made emissions "will enhance the greenhouse effect, resulting on average in additional warming of the earth's surface." The panel of hundreds of scientists from 25 countries expects a global warming of 5 degrees in the 21st century, unless we reduce emissions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lindzen also takes Mr. Gelb to task for suggesting that carbon dioxide fouls the air. Perhaps that is an unfortunate choice of words; technically, carbon dioxide is not a pollutant, in that it does not cause health problems. But its relentless buildup in the atmosphere is a threat to the health of the planet's most important environmental systems. That life evolved when carbon dioxide concentrations were high is exactly the point. We shouldn't be fooling with Mother Nature.</p>
        <p>Last year, half of this country's Nobel laureates and members of the National Academy of Sciences wrote the President to urge him to take action to prevent global warming. Those are scientists, not politicians. Mr. Lindzen seems to be on a crusade to confuse what is indisputably a scientific consensus about the threat of global warming. The December 1989 issue of Science magazine had it right in an article about this iconoclast titled "Greenhouse Skeptic Out in the Cold."  TIMOTHY E. WIRTH U.S. Senator from Colorado Washington, Feb. 20, 1991</p>
