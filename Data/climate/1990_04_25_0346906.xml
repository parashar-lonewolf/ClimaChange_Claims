        <p>LEAD: If the books people are buying are an indication, a new decade has already ushered in a new mood in America.</p>
        <p>If the books people are buying are an indication, a new decade has already ushered in a new mood in America.</p>
        <p>Gone from best-seller lists are the books of businessmen like Donald Trump and Lee Iacocca, whose first-person accounts of their successes sold millions of copies and made the authors icons of the 1980's. In their place, a host of successful books have emerged about the newly perceived greed of the last decade, and about the need to place environmental concerns above personal acquisitiveness and unfettered industrial expansion.</p>
        <p>Several books scheduled for publication question the legacy of Ronald Reagan. Among them are ''Disorder and Decline: Crime and the Spiral of Decay in American Neighborhoods,'' by William Skogan (Free Press), ''The Politics of Rich and Poor: Wealth and the American Electorate in the Reagan Aftermath,'' by Kevin Phillips (Random House), and ''The Worst Years of our Lives: An Outsider's View of the 80's,'' by Barbera Ehrenreich (Pantheon).</p>
        <p>''What we are seeing in the books that are selling is the turnaround from the celebration of greed to the denigration of greed,'' said Linda Grey, the president of Bantam Books.</p>
        <p>Heroes No More</p>
        <p>Gary Del Vecchio, president of Doubleday bookstores, said the absence of best-selling business biographies or autobiographies had become a subject of discussion at Doubleday stores. Noting the success of several books on the environment, he said, ''We are seeing an absolute change in the things that readers are focusing on.''</p>
        <p>Howard Kaminsky, chief executive of the Hearst Trade Book group, asked: ''What businessmen as heroes are left?''</p>
        <p>Publishers perceive a new mood of questioning about exactly what happened during the Reagan years -specifically, whether the making of big fortunes on Wall Street and a rash of debt-financed consumer spending masked deep underlying problems like sagging national competitiveness and the growing gap between rich and poor.</p>
        <p>''People feel like they are waking up experiencing the hangover after a smashing good drunkfest,'' said Steve Wasserman, the editorial director of Times Books. ''In the cold morning light, they are assessing a country that seems adrift at a time when all political and economic assumptions are up for grabs.''</p>
        <p>Some publishers, including Ms. Grey of Bantam, said they believe it was Tom Wolfe's best-selling novel ''The Bonfire of the Vanities,'' published in 1987, that initiated the shift to a more critical focus on the Reagan years. More recently, the talk of the New York book-party circuit has been two best-selling books that take critical looks at the frenzied deal-making on Wall Street in the 1980's: ''Barbarians at the Gate,'' by Bryan Burrough and John Helyar (Harper &amp; Row), and ''Liar's Poker,'' by Michael Lewis (W. W. Norton).</p>
        <p>Saving the Earth Is Popular</p>
        <p>This mood of reassessment has also helped make the environment and ecology hot topics in publishing, analysts say. Dozens of books on the subject have been, or are scheduled to be, published.</p>
        <p>''A lot of the psychic energy that went into political protest is now finding in the environment an outlet that provides the same sort of pleasures and sense of moral justification,'' said Erwin Glikes, president of the Free Press.</p>
        <p>The most successful of the books has been ''50 Simple Things You Can Do to Save the Earth,'' self-published by the San Francisco-based Earthworks Press, co-owned by John Javna and Julie Bennett. This has been on the New York Times best-seller list for 12 weeks.</p>
        <p>A follow-up book, ''50 Simple Things Kids Can Do to Save the Earth,'' has just been published by Andrews &amp; McMeel, a Kansas publisher, and has had very brisk initial sales, he said.</p>
        <p>Donna Martin, vice-president of Andrews &amp; McMeel, said the books were so successful because they suggest something positive people can do about the environment. ''We've been having weird weather here in Kansas - a warm January and now Easter cold, and in the popular perception that's linked to the Amazon burning, the greenhouse effect and acid rain,'' she said. ''People want to get involved. There's a turn from the 'me' to the 'we' decade.'' Another publisher suggested this was the ''re'' decade - one obsessed with recycling.</p>
        <p>''Chico Mendes could be a hero for the 90's,'' commented one publisher, referring to the slain Brazilian rubber tapper about whom two books are to appear soon.</p>
        <p>A Sequel by Trump</p>
        <p>Others think business books still have big potential, despite their current slump. Mr. Trump, whose first book, ''The Art of the Deal'' (Random House) has sold more than two million copies, has a second book, ''Trump: Surviving at the Top,'' also scheduled to be published by Random House later this year. ''It's deeper and more poignant than my first, and I think it will do even better,'' he said. Asked about the success of ''Barbarians'' and ''Liar's Poker,'' Mr. Trump said, ''People love reading negative things about successful people.''</p>
        <p>Whether or not the new Trump book does well, several publishers said they believed the first book that really addresses America's new questioning mood, and offers solutions, could be very successful. ''People are floundering for a vision, and nobody has yet articulated it,'' Mr. Wasserman said. Mr. Kaminsky said there was thirst for ''a new motivational hero.''</p>
        <p>And Mr. Glikes of The Free Press added: ''There is a sense of gridlock in the country, of a pious concern masking the fact problems are not confronted. The first book to really confront them could be very big.''</p>
