        <p>Some government researchers have come up with a new idea for improving fuel economy -- the cool seat.</p>
        <p>The Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory reported on Thursday that if every car and truck on America's roads was equipped with ventilated seats, air-conditioning-related gasoline consumption could be reduced by 7.5 percent, thus saving 522 million gallons of fuel per year.</p>
        <p>The seats tested have two built-in fans that suck warm air and moisture through their perforated leather and send it away from the driver or passenger.</p>
        <p>Ventilated seats make drivers feel cooler, so they could save fuel by turning their air-conditioners down a notch, in theory.</p>
        <p>''But try telling that to some guy driving through Mississippi on a hot day in July,'' said David Caldwell, a spokesman for Cadillac.</p>
        <p>The seats, ComfortCools, made by W.E.T. Automotive Systems of Germany, are offered as an option in the Cadillac STS.</p>
        <p>Mr. Caldwell says 30 to 40 percent of STS models are ordered with ventilated seats, but only as part of $3,000 to $10,000 luxury packages that also include some features (including a heated steering wheel) that actually make the car less fuel-efficient.</p>
        <p>Closely related to the ventilated seat is the heated and air-conditioned ''climatized'' seat with its own refrigeration unit, seen in an increasing number of upscale vehicles. Cooled seats are hot, but they're not exactly fuel savers.</p>
