        <p>Everybody agrees that toxic wastes are nasty. But getting rid of them has become increasingly difficult as environmentalists and regulators have recognized the danger of stashing pesticide residues, chemical industry leftovers and paint sludges in landfills, where the toxins can seep into public water supplies.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, one of the few alternatives to dumping, the incinerator, also has a flaw: the smokestack. As waste is burned, hot gases spew into the atmosphere, carrying with them any toxic materials not consumed by the flames. The Clinton Administration recently imposed a ban on new hazardous-waste incinerators.</p>
        <p>And so developers see commercial opportunities for two distinctly different technologies that are now emerging from the laboratory and moving to pilot plants.</p>
        <p>Both approaches eliminate toxic wastes by exposing them to intense heat in closed vessels, breaking the materials down into simple, safe compounds with virtually no emissions. One method effectively "burns" them in water; the other uses a bath of molten metal to reduce complex chemicals to their elemental constituents.</p>
        <p>The first technique depends on the phenomenon of "supercritical" water. When water is heated to more than 705 degrees Fahrenheit and compressed to 3,200 pounds a square inch, it ceases to act like a liquid or a gas, and its physical properties change in other striking ways.</p>
        <p>Oily substances, which do not mix with water at ordinary temperatures and pressures, are easily soluble in supercritical water. And salts, which do dissolve in ordinary water, are separated out in supercritical water.</p>
        <p>These characteristics of supercritical water have led researchers at the University of Texas at Austin and at some private companies to develop disposal systems in which water, waste and a source of excess oxygen are placed in a big pressure cooker. Once the water reaches the supercritical phase, the waste molecules break down to their constituent atoms. These atoms then combine with the excess oxygen, which may come from injecting gaseous oxygen or liquid hydrogen peroxide. This is the equivalent of burning, but without the flame or smoke. Test Projects Under Way</p>
        <p>Companies at work on such systems include the General Atomics Corporation of San Diego; Eco Waste Technologies of Austin, and the Modell Development Corporation of Framingham, Mass. Supercritical water oxidation is undergoing commercial testing in three or four locations, and the Departments of Defense, Commerce and Energy are sponsoring nearly a dozen projects.</p>
        <p>The economics of supercritical water oxidation are such that it works best with wastes that are watery to start with, like sludge from municipal sewage plants, wastes from pulp and paper mills, and the remnants of pharmaceutical and food processing. The technique produces clear water, carbon dioxide and an ash that can be disposed of in a landfill.</p>
        <p>Since this "burning" of carbon-based compounds releases heat, the process can be self-sustaining after the initial heating, as new toxic "fuel" is gradually added while the waste products are drawn off or filtered out. And because the combustion takes place in a fluid, there are no air pollutants like oxides of nitrogen, oxides of sulfur or particulate emissions, all three of which are byproducts of incinerators. Variety of Uses</p>
        <p>Supercritical water can be used to treat a broad variety of nonorganic wastes as well, including chlorinated hydrocarbons like PCB's, which come from old electrical transformers and are difficult to dispose of, as well as old solid rocket propellants and nerve gas that has been stashed in Government warehouses since the chilliest days of the cold war.</p>
        <p>These more complicated wastes present more problems, because elements like chlorine, sulfur and phosphorus form highly corrosive acids that attack virtually any alloy used in the walls of reactor vessels. The acids can be neutralized by adding a base, like sodium hydroxide, but this does not completely solve the problem, because the resulting salts are sticky and tend to gum up the system.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, agencies of the Defense Department are intent on perfecting supercritical water oxidation to clean up cold war remnants like the five million rounds of chemical warfare ammunition that is slowly corroding in military warehouses.</p>
        <p>While some corporate scientists experiment with the watery demise of toxic waste, others are busily adapting an approach, first developed at United States Steel in the early 1980's, that destroys wastes by injecting them into a bath of molten metal, usually iron. The technology was inspired by the steelmaker's desire to lower energy costs by using waste items, like scrap tires, as fuel.</p>
        <p>Molten Metal Technology Inc. of Waltham, Mass., has come up with a system for injecting toxic materials into a pool of molten iron at 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Such treatment causes almost all compounds to break down into their constituent elements because of the intense heat and the catalytic effect of the metal. Hydrocarbons are rendered into hydrogen, which bubbles off the top of the bath, and carbon, which similarly boils off as carbon dioxide gas if oxygen is provided.</p>
        <p>As in supercritical water oxidation, the process occurs in a closed system, with minimal releases to the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>The company touts the process as recycling, and indeed some materials, like the gases, can be separated and recovered. Vastly more important is the regulatory reality that once substances are labeled as waste, a company is liable for them forever. If the materials can be broken down and the constituents re-used, however, nothing remains that could become a liability in the future.</p>
        <p>If the metal bath is installed in a plant as part of a manufacturer's production system, the material going into it, no matter how toxic, stands a good chance of being considered a "process intermediate" that will be rendered harmless before it leaves the factory. Thus no waste needs to be reported to regulators and a company's environmental liability is reduced.</p>
        <p>The process has some limitations. Because of the prohibitive energy costs of keeping the metal molten, the process cannot handle wastes with a high concentration of water, which would act as a coolant. That would seem to leave that part of the market to supercritical water.</p>
        <p>And at this point, the company cannot separate out metals while the process is in operation, so it has to market the result as an alloy or treat the alloy in a separate process to recover valuable materials. If a company with a lot of printed circuit boards wanted to run them through the bath to recover the small quantities of gold and silver in each board, for example, the process would require two steps. Mining an Alloy</p>
        <p>"If you operate the technology properly, you could get all the gold to accumulate until you had a gold-rich alloy," said Ian C. Yates, Molten Metal's vice president for market development. Then the furnace could be taken out of operation and the gold leached out of the alloy using mining techniques.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yates said a top research goal was to find ways of separating metals out while the bath was still in operation by adding chemicals that would combine with them and have them precipitate out of solution.</p>
        <p>Molten Metal has built a small commercial-scale plant in Fall River, Mass., which is capable of processing up to two tons of waste an hour, and it anticipates testing waste for such potential customers as the Du Pont Company later this year.  BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY</p>
