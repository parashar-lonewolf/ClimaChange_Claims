        <p>Just a few years ago, ''eco-resort'' referred mainly to crunchy retreats in places like Costa Rica where even the cat's leftovers were composted. But with ''sustainability'' now a buzzword in nearly every industry, green is becoming the new normal in luxury hotels. According to the International Ecotourism Society, the eco-tourism category grew three times faster than the industry as a whole in 2004. Marketers attribute the growth to a group they call ''metrospirituals'' -- hybrid-driving, yoga-practicing baby- and echo-boomers for whom social responsibility and seeking out new adventures are a way of life.</p>

        <p>Just a few years ago, ''eco-resort'' referred mainly to crunchy retreats in places like Costa Rica where even the cat's leftovers were composted. But with ''sustainability'' now a buzzword in nearly every industry, green is becoming the new normal in luxury hotels. According to the International Ecotourism Society, the eco-tourism category grew three times faster than the industry as a whole in 2004. Marketers attribute the growth to a group they call ''metrospirituals'' -- hybrid-driving, yoga-practicing baby- and echo-boomers for whom social responsibility and seeking out new adventures are a way of life.</p>
        <p>While progressively more luxurious eco-resorts have been opening in early-adopting regions, the boom is currently spreading to more surprising destinations -- like megapolluting Brazil. ''Anyone with any feeling for the world is going green,'' says the cult interior designer Anouska Hempel, who is at work on Warapuru, a lavish eco-resort set to open next year on Brazil's north coast; made entirely of locally sourced materials, it will have customized spa treatments using native plants (www.warapuru.com).</p>
        <p>China -- home to the world's 10 most polluted cities -- gets its first fully sustainable five-star eco-resort next month with Crosswaters Ecolodge (011-86-0752-7693-666; www.crosswaters.com.cn; doubles from $280); guests in this Guangdong retreat will visit a Keija tribal village and sleep in bamboo aeries. In the Western Ghats of India, the New York architect Steven Harris has broken ground on the 3,000-acre Shilim Eco-Resort, where many rooms will have private bathing gardens with infinity pools. And in developing Mozambique, Guludo Beach Lodge recently opened in Quirimbas National Park: nine tented oceanfront suites by the London architects Cullum &amp; Nightingale (www.bespokeexperience.com; doubles from $235).</p>
        <p>Closer to home, the Orchard Garden Hotel opens next month in San Francisco (888-717-2881; www.theorchardgardenhotel.com; doubles from $149), the first urban hotel in America to earn the United States Green Building Council's LEED certification. In the Caribbean region, Ritz-Carlton is trailblazing with the Ã¼ber-luxe West Caicos Reserve in the Turks and Caicos, where roads won't have tar, and vegetation won't be disrupted beyond three feet of the buildings.</p>
        <p>No doubt surging energy costs and media attention to climate change are powering this Al Gore effect. For developers, the bottom line helps, too. ''Once eco-friendly systems are paid down,'' says Christina Koch, the editor of Eco-structure magazine, ''these buildings are not paying for electricity. It's cost-effective.''</p>
        <p>The take-away for travelers: guilt-free luxury. ''If eco-lodges were the vegans of the industry, this new breed is vegetarian,'' says Hitesh Mehta from EDSA, the architects behind Crosswaters. Meat-free, but with a Michelin-star chef.</p>
