        <p>THE Bloomberg administration's proposal to charge cars and trucks to enter Manhattan below 86th Street will help reduce air pollution and improve the health of some New Yorkers, but not all. Indeed, it is likely to worsen the health of many New Yorkers, particularly the poor.</p>
        <p>And contrary to Mayor Michael Bloomberg's claim that his congestion pricing proposal will reduce traffic throughout the city, common sense dictates that it will lead to more traffic in Brooklyn, Harlem, Queens, the South Bronx and Washington Heights. Why is that? Because drivers will be looking for parking near subways there to take them to Midtown. Truck traffic coming into the city will continue unabated and trucks crossing Manhattan will detour through poorer neighborhoods. The consequence of all this will be increased air pollution in those areas.</p>
        <p>Exposure to air pollution increases our risk of cancer, heart attacks and respiratory diseases like asthma. There is also growing evidence that prenatal exposure to air pollutants can hurt fetal growth and cognitive development.</p>
        <p>Asthma is a serious public health problem in New York City and disproportionately affects residents of impoverished areas. Two neighborhoods in Harlem and five in the Bronx are among the top 10 New York City neighborhoods with the highest rates of hospitalization for asthma in children. Hospitalization rates for asthma are nearly 10 times higher among children from the lowest-income ZIP codes in New York City compared to children from the highest-income ZIP codes.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, children in the South Bronx are twice as likely as children in other parts of the city to attend school near a highway. And in Manhattan, most of the diesel bus terminals are near schools or day care centers north of 110th Street. Poor people in the city are far more likely to live in high-traffic areas and be exposed to high levels of particulate matter from diesel and gasoline exhaust.</p>
        <p>At the risk of oversimplification, we can think of air pollution in New York City as coming primarily from two sources: regional industrial polluters and vehicle exhaust. In the city, however, the largest source of air pollution is from vehicle exhaust generated by the huge number of cars and diesel trucks traveling through and around the city. This exhaust contains hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen and sulfur gases. These compounds, along with high levels of ozone (produced by the effect of sunlight on hydrocarbons) cause wheezing, shortness of breath, inflammation in the lungs and even allergic responses in people who are not prone to allergies.</p>
        <p>The 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta provided an opportunity for a natural experiment to evaluate the impact of citywide traffic changes on air pollution and health. All vehicles except buses were barred from much of downtown Atlanta during the Games. This decrease in traffic was associated with a prolonged reduction in ozone, carbon monoxide and particulate levels. As a result, pediatric acute care visits and hospitalizations for asthma in Atlanta decreased more than 40 percent.</p>
        <p>New York City needs a more comprehensive plan to reduce vehicle traffic than Mayor Bloomberg has offered. We should focus on providing better and less expensive mass transit from the suburbs, expanded express subway options throughout the city, incentives to companies to use trucks that pollute less, strict enforcement of laws against idling, reduced fees for registering vehicles that meet tighter emission standards and safe bicycle lanes throughout the city.</p>
        <p>People might object that many of these initiatives will stretch the city budget. State and federal subsidies are important. But in the larger scheme of things, the city should spend money to protect citizens' health. Ultimately, reducing asthma and other respiratory illnesses will reduce hospital costs, and good health is something everyone deserves.</p>
