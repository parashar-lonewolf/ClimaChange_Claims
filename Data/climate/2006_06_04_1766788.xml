        <p>Intensifying complaints about a cut in antiterrorism money for New York City, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton challenged President Bush on Saturday to take responsibility for the action, saying that ''at some point, the buck stops in the White House.''</p>
        <p>''We're going to have to go to the White House and just make it very clear: We don't appreciate being used as a prop,'' said Mrs. Clinton, appearing with Representative Peter T. King, a Long Island Republican, at a news conference. ''We don't appreciate people coming here and having conventions and doing photo ops and then sticking us where it hurts with a decision like this.''</p>
        <p>But in a letter sent to the New York Congressional delegation Friday night, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff noted that New York City has received far more money under the program in question, the Urban Areas Security Initiative, than any other city. The cut between this year and last year, he wrote, was the result of an unusually high appropriation for the program in 2005, itself meant to offset an unusually low appropriation in 2004.</p>
        <p>In response to one particular criticism by Mrs. Clinton, Mr. King and others -- that the department deemed New York to have no national icons or monuments -- the letter said that the Empire State Building had been classified as commercial infrastructure and the Brooklyn Bridge as transportation infrastructure. Both categories, the letter said, gave New York City's application a higher score than if they had been classified as monuments.</p>
        <p>Those categorizations represent a greater potential for loss of life as well as economic damage, a spokesman for the department, Russ Knocke, said Saturday.</p>
        <p>The decision in question was the allocation of $711 million in federal antiterrorism financing across the United States. New York's share of the 2006 grants was reduced by 40 percent, to $124.5 million this year, from $207.6 million in 2005.</p>
        <p>Since the grant allocations were announced last week, members of the New York delegation have directed their ire at Mr. Chertoff. They launched a postcard campaign, urging voters to send postcards to Mr. Chertoff featuring New York icons like the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chertoff's letter said that the city had received about 19 percent of all grants to high-risk metropolitan areas from 2003 to 2005, and received about 18 percent this year. ''New York City received a funding percentage roughly equivalent to the average it received in the preceding three years,'' he wrote.</p>
        <p>The letter did not mention a report by the department that found flaws in the city's grant application, including criticism of overtime costs for police officers assigned to counterterrorism duties.</p>
        <p>Mr. Knocke said that the department's analysis had included roughly 7,000 critical sites in the five boroughs. The actual grant allocation for the city, he added, ''would not have changed at all if these monuments or stadiums had been listed as icons and monuments.''</p>
        <p>The Statue of Liberty, he said is a federal property under New York State jurisdiction, and so it was included on the state's list of critical sites, not the city's.</p>
        <p>Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg also has criticized the reduction. During his weekly radio program on Friday, he questioned whether there had been a ''breakdown'' within the agency and said that Mr. Chertoff had pledged to look into the matter over the weekend. Among the outstanding questions was whether New York officials had made mistakes in submitting the grant application, as some Homeland Security officials had suggested. A mayoral spokeswoman said yesterday that the application had been submitted properly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Knocke confirmed that the mayor and Mr. Chertoff had had ''a very productive conversation,'' but said that the department was not yet contemplating an increase in the city's grant money.</p>
        <p>''We're not going back to review the awards,'' he said. ''If somebody comes to us and says that, in our review, there has been a factual and substantive error, we'll go back and take a look at that.''</p>
        <p>The back-and-forth came after several days of harsh criticism by Senator Clinton of the Bush administration on an array of subjects, including energy policy and the environment, as she toured the state on a campaign swing following her nomination by the state Democratic Party in Buffalo last week. Although Mrs. Clinton is not facing any formidable opposition for her Senate seat, she is considering whether to run for president in 2008, giving her remarks about national policy and the Republican leadership extra resonance.</p>
        <p>In Port Washington, on Long Island, Saturday morning, where she accepted the endorsement by the League of Conservation Voters, Mrs. Clinton skewered the Republican leadership in Washington for ''putting ideology before science'' in addressing global climate change.</p>
        <p>Two days earlier, in an informal gathering of patrons at the Carmel Diner in Putnam County, Mrs. Clinton digressed from answering a question to remark, ''We are now in a time in our history when the leadership is very secretive, very controlling, and very much wanting to do everything without having to answer any questions.''</p>
