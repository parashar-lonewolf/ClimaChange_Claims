      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial calls on New York Gov Eliot Spitzer to establish ambitious goals for reducing emissions of carbon dioxide; says much can be done by executive order, thus avoiding impasse with Legislature; says along with California Gov Arnold Schwarzenegger's commitment to reducing emissions, Spitzer's intervention could compel Congress to address problem of global warming and to pass meaningful federal legislation</p>

        <p>Given the concerns of the new Democratic Congress, as well as persuasive new scientific evidence of the dangers of climate change, Washington may finally be ready to address the problem of global warming. The chances of that would be better still if New York's new governor, Eliot Spitzer, would commit himself and the state to a cause that needs all the friends it can get.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer should quickly commit himself to establishing ambitious goals for reducing emissions of carbon dioxide from cars, power plants and other industrial sources in New York State, and to writing regulations to achieve those goals. That will mean butting heads with powerful constituencies like the utilities, but Mr. Spitzer has always enjoyed a good fight. And with California's governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, already committed, Mr. Spitzer's intervention could tip the national debate and compel Washington to move more quickly than it might have to endorse meaningful federal legislation.</p>

        <p>Given the concerns of the new Democratic Congress, as well as persuasive new scientific evidence of the dangers of climate change, Washington may finally be ready to address the problem of global warming. The chances of that would be better still if New York's new governor, Eliot Spitzer, would commit himself and the state to a cause that needs all the friends it can get.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer should quickly commit himself to establishing ambitious goals for reducing emissions of carbon dioxide from cars, power plants and other industrial sources in New York State, and to writing regulations to achieve those goals. That will mean butting heads with powerful constituencies like the utilities, but Mr. Spitzer has always enjoyed a good fight. And with California's governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, already committed, Mr. Spitzer's intervention could tip the national debate and compel Washington to move more quickly than it might have to endorse meaningful federal legislation.</p>
        <p>California has pointed the way. Last fall it became the first state to mandate reductions of greenhouse gas emissions from every sector of the economy. The plan calls for reducing such emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, with a longer-range goal of an 80 percent reduction by 2050. A state law already requires automobile companies to begin producing more fuel-efficient cars. And in January, Mr. Schwarzenegger ordered refineries and other fuel producers to reduce emissions by 10 percent, largely through the development of alternative fuels. California has also warned that it will stop buying electricity from power producers outside the state that produce heavy carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
        <p>This would be a hard act to follow for any governor, but to some extent Mr. Spitzer's path has already been smoothed by his predecessor, George Pataki. Mr. Pataki joined with California in demanding more fuel-efficient cars and increased funds for energy-efficiency programs, and he directed that by 2013 one-quarter of New York's power must be produced by renewable fuels. And -- perhaps most important -- Mr. Pataki enrolled New York in an effort to reduce regional greenhouse gas emissions involving seven Northeastern states.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer, who built a formidable environmental record of his own as attorney general, has endorsed all of these programs. But he will have to go further if he intends to match Mr. Schwarzenegger. Among other things, he must help get the regional greenhouse initiative up and running, and make sure that any new power plants built to meet the state's energy needs use the most modern technologies and add as little as possible to the atmosphere's already heavy carbon burden.</p>
        <p>This is a tall order even for an aggressive new governor. But the good news is that most of what Mr. Spitzer must do can be accomplished by executive order, thus skirting an unadventurous Legislature that tends to prefer business as usual.</p>
