        <p>After a week of international squabbling at the summit meeting here on the environment and development, two uneasy neighbors lifted spirits today with an unexpected agreement: Israel and Jordan announced that they would join forces to save the Dead Sea, the biblical body of water that is rapidly receding.</p>

        <p>After a week of international squabbling at the summit meeting here on the environment and development, two uneasy neighbors lifted spirits today with an unexpected agreement: Israel and Jordan announced that they would join forces to save the Dead Sea, the biblical body of water that is rapidly receding.</p>
        <p>The Dead Sea, on the border between the two countries, sits in a place that is revered by Jews, Christians and Muslims. It is near the waters where Jesus is believed to have been baptized; near Mount Nebo, where the Bible says Moses saw the Promised Land; and near the Kerak fortress, where Muslim fighters conquered Christian crusaders in the 1100's.</p>
        <p>But the sea is ebbing by three feet each year as a thirsty region diverts virtually all of the water that originally flowed into it from the river Jordan.</p>
        <p>Over the next 50 years, the sea could to shrink to less than half of its current size, officials say. To prevent that, Israel and Jordan plan to build a 186-mile pipeline at a cost of about $1 billion to pump water from the Red Sea into the Dead Sea.</p>
        <p>The project, which officials described as the largest cooperative venture between the two nations, is expected to begin after a nine-month study is completed.</p>
        <p>The pipeline will take two to three years to build, and the governments hope to finance it with foreign donations. Officials say the project will save the Dead Sea and preserve the unique wildlife, and the tourism industry, that flourish around it.</p>
        <p>But perhaps the biggest dividend is the signal that peace and cooperation might still be possible between Arabs and Jews in a region with seemingly endless conflict. Ministers from the two nations, whose relationship has been strained by the recent violence, sat side by side in a hotel suite here as they discussed their plans.</p>
        <p>''This sends a message that we do live in one area with a common destiny,'' Bassem I. Awadallah, Jordan's planning minister, said in an interview. ''The environment, ecology and nature know no boundaries and no political conflicts.''</p>
        <p>Roni Milo, the Israeli minister for regional cooperation, agreed.</p>
        <p>''We think this is a very important environmental project,'' he said, ''but it's also going to be helpful in the future for establishing good relations in the region.</p>
        <p>''This can show us that on an environmental issue we can find cooperation between countries that sometimes, in other issues, find it's not so easy to find cooperation.''</p>
        <p>The announcement came as weary negotiators from around the world struggled to complete an international action plan to combat poverty and climate change and to preserve the world's forests, lakes and wildlife.</p>
        <p>Officials at the United Nations World Summit on Sustainable Development said tonight that they were nearing consensus on language calling for the reduction of trade subsidies in wealthy countries. But they remained deeply divided over timetables for providing more poor people with access to sanitation and for converting from oil and gas to solar and wind power and other sources of renewable energy.</p>
        <p>The United States and the European Union have opposed language that criticizes the subsidies that protect their farmers and businesses from foreign competition. American officials have also refused to support specific targets and timetables on the sanitation and energy issues.</p>
        <p>Developing countries want the world to agree to halve the number of people without sanitation by 2015. The European Union wants nations to make commitments to ensure that renewable energy sources account for 15 percent of the world's total energy production by 2010.</p>
        <p>The United States has refused, saying it prefers to finance concrete programs as opposed to supporting targets and deadlines that may never be met. Meanwhile, poor countries have been resisting efforts by American and European officials to link aid to steps on their part to fight corruption and improve human rights, delegates said.</p>
        <p>Today leaders urged the negotiators to find a compromise to ensure that the meeting produces a strong and memorable action plan.</p>
        <p>''We have absolutely no choice,'' Jean Chrétien, the Canadian prime minister, said at a news conference. ''We must deliver.''</p>
        <p>There was progress on a number of issues, including a compromise on protecting endangered animals and plants, which calls for a significant reduction in the rate of extinction by 2010. Delegates also agreed to phase out the use and production of chemicals that harm human health and the environment by 2020.</p>
        <p>But with battles over sanitation and energy still raging, some officials feared that the plan would not be completed by Monday, when more than 100 presidents and prime ministers will meet here to discuss strategies to reduce poverty and environmental degradation.</p>
        <p>''From South Africa's point of view it's certainly a challenging process,'' said Alec Erwin, that country's minister of trade and industry. ''This is a massive negotiation.''</p>
        <p>The ministers from Israel and Jordan expressed hope that their project would encourage other countries to work together, even under difficult circumstances. The pipeline will begin in Israel and run through Jordan. After it is built, the officials would like to build a canal to carry water from the Red Sea that would be desalted to meet the water needs of Jordan.</p>
        <p>The officials described it as a major step forward. Hopes that the two nations would work closely together have dimmed since they signed a peace accord in 1994. Relations have cooled since the current Palestinian uprising began two years ago.</p>
        <p>But today the ministers joked and laughed as they discussed the pipeline and considered other projects. They talked about how to revive the tourism industry in the region. They also talked, carefully, about the conflict that has battered Israel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milo said he hoped that the Palestinians and Arab countries would work together in this project and others in coming years. Dr. Hazim el-Naser, Jordan's minister of water and irrigation, commented: ''People are saying that water will cause wars. We in the region, we're saying, 'No.' Water will enhance cooperation. We can build peace through water projects.''</p>
