        <p>For 20 years, local officials carefully measured this city's air pollution levels and equally carefully hid the results -- fearing that the truth might tarnish the capital's image or lead to social unrest. This continued even as Beijing's famously blue sky turned ever more gray and its surrounding hills disappeared behind an acrid mist.</p>
        <p>So it seemed a small miracle when, on Feb. 28, Beijing joined 38 other Chinese cities that have started to issue weekly air quality reports in the last year. In newspapers and on television, they parade a sometimes eclectic mix of statistics -- from levels of nitrous oxides produced by car exhausts to the concentration of tiny particles from coal burning in the air. And Chinese citizens for the first time have hard information on the air they breathe.</p>
        <p>Despite technical flaws, the tangled mass of data has confirmed what many Western scientists have suspected and at times measured: that the air in China's cities is among the most polluted in the world, and contains the highest levels of pollutants harmful to health. Recent research suggests that bad air causes 178,000 premature deaths a year.</p>
        <p>The severity of the pollution, now openly acknowledged by the Government, has propelled environmental issues onto the agenda of the Chinese-American summit meeting that is to take place later this month. Chinese officials say they are eager to have Washington's technical help in the battle for cleaner air.</p>
        <p>But more than that, the Government's candor has created a new political dynamic between the Government and its people, feeding an environmental consciousness.</p>
        <p>''The air is bad -- you can read it in the newspapers,'' said Zhang Jiyan, from her roadside bathing-suit stand in downtown Beijing. ''Look, you can't even see tall buildings a few streets from here.''</p>
        <p>People who six months ago might have peered out the window and seen fog, or wu, now realize that it is pollution, or wuran. And their anger in turn has encouraged local governments to develop more ambitious, if not always realistic, efforts -- for example, requiring car owners to install catalytic converters.</p>
        <p>''Releasing the numbers is a revolutionary concept for the people and the Government,'' said Lu Xinyuan, of the State Environmental Protection Agency. ''We were worried that the people would complain that air pollution is too serious. Instead, the consciousness of people has been raised. And they feel the Government trusts them with the facts, so we are gaining points by doing this.''</p>
        <p>Others suggest another motive: the weekly barrage of frightening statistics has generated popular support for otherwise unpalatable Government moves, like shutting down inefficient state-owned enterprises, with the inevitable loss of jobs.</p>
        <p>''Why are they being so open about this?'' asked one Western diplomat. ''It's because it dovetails with their economic agenda. This way when the factory gets closed, the people want it to be closed, even though the real reason it has to be closed is not for pollution but for economics.''</p>
        <p>These days in Beijing, everyone is complaining about the air. Since the weekly air quality reports began three months ago, the city's air has ranked 4 on its 1-to-5 pollution scale (5 being the worst) every week but two, said Yu Xiaoxuan, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau.</p>
        <p>Level-4 pollution can have serious health effects on people with heart or lung problems, and could make others feel uncomfortable as well.</p>
        <p>Many Beijing residents suspect that the truth is even worse -- after all, theirs is a leadership that until a few years ago shaved degrees from summer temperatures in news reports in the name of morale. Elderly people who used to exercise outside in the early morning -- when pollution is usually worst -- are postponing their exercises until later in the day, and ''fresh air'' tours of the countryside have become popular.</p>
        <p>At the Beijing Children's Research Clinic, mothers carrying hacking children and newly prescribed medicine are quick to complain. Two-year-old Long Fei ''often gets sick with colds and infections,'' said his mother, who identified herself only as Lin. ''You see it on TV. The air is not good, that's the problem.''</p>
        <p>According to the World Bank, 5 of the world's 10 most polluted cities are in China, and despite some recent successful efforts to combat the problem, pollutant levels are two to five times the World Health Organization guidelines for safe exposure.</p>
        <p>''China is still among the world's most polluted countries,'' said Qu Geping, chairman of the National People's Congress's Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Committee. ''Among 600 cities, 70 to 80 percent can't even meet our own air standards.''</p>
        <p>For years now, Mr. Qu has campaigned for greater openness in this field, prodding China's cities to abide by a generally ignored 1987 law that required them to release data about their air. But last year the State Council stepped up the pressure, and starting with Nanjing in May 1997, dozens of cities have now complied.</p>
        <p>Still, many experts worry about the reliability of the reports, according to Todd Johnson, an environmental economist at the World Bank, since local environmental bureaus are often understaffed, relying on old equipment and techniques.</p>
        <p>Experts also find the reports sometimes incomplete or confusing. A number of cities, including Beijing, report only some of the vast number of statistics they measure. And many report air quality according to an ''air pollution index,'' with scores derived from a formula that combines harmful and innocuous pollutants in such a complex manner that even specialists have trouble interpreting its significance.</p>
        <p>Dr. Wang Lihua, a professor of environmental health at Beijing Medical University, and her former student Dr. Xiping Xu, now at the Harvard School of Public Health, have been studying pollution in Beijing more than 15 years. They say they do not entirely understand how Beijing determines daily rankings.</p>
        <p>''I don't always trust the data,'' Dr. Xu said. ''But in the end, whether the number is 100 or 150 is not so important -- we know it's very high. And this is a very good step to publish the information, to let people gain knowledge.''</p>
        <p>The most serious pollutant in most Chinese cities is tiny airborne particles, measured as total suspended particles, produced primarily by the burning of coal and, increasingly, car exhausts. Mexico City's notoriously bad air contains different types of pollutants, mostly small chemical compounds that are not thought to be as dangerous to health.</p>
        <p>In China, coal also produces sulfur dioxide, the source of acid rain. Cars add nitrous oxides.</p>
        <p>In terms of suspended particles, ''Chinese cities are among the worst in the world -- that's just a fact,'' said Mr. Johnson, the World Bank official. ''Because they are so dependent on coal, I can't think of any city in the world that's as bad as the worst cities in China.''</p>
        <p>In China, which has only limited access to oil and natural gas, coal powers huge factories, fuels restaurant stoves and heats homes. In Beijing, where coal produces 80 percent of energy, mountains of it fill courtyards, especially in winter, and bicycles towing carts piled with coal briquettes are everywhere.</p>
        <p>On top of that, there are 1.3 million cars registered in Beijing today, compared with 200,000 a decade ago. And the average Chinese car produces 10 to 15 times the exhaust of its American counterpart.</p>
        <p>Medical researchers have begun to document the toll that air pollution is taking on human health here.</p>
        <p>In studies, Dr. Xu of Harvard and colleagues in China have found that urban air pollution contributes to increased deaths, premature births and low birth weight. They have also found that breathing Beijing's air depresses lung function in otherwise healthy individuals and that on polluted days, the number of hospital visits skyrockets.</p>
        <p>''In a city like Beijing, you've got 20,000 excess deaths at the end of the year,'' Mr. Johnson said. (Beijing's population is 12 million.) ''You throw in a few badly polluted days and the old person dies a few months earlier than otherwise.''</p>
        <p>The asthma rate has reached 5 percent in some areas around factories. Specialists at Beijing Children's Hospital now see 60 wheezing, coughing children a day.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hu Yiji, the hospital's director, said he believed secondhand cigarette smoke was the biggest culprit, but acknowledged pollution as a problem. ''We tell parents if they smoke, to quit,'' he said. ''And then we advise them to take the kids to the suburbs when they can.''</p>
        <p>The central Government recently announced plans to spend 1.2 percent of the G.N.P. on pollution control and is desperately seeking an alternative to coal. It is pumping natural gas to Beijing from Shaanxi Province. It is negotiating with Russia to import gas. It also has plans to close down urban factories and convert coal into electricity near the coal mines to keep the pollution out of the cities.</p>
        <p>At best, these changes could reduce reliance on coal to about 65 percent in 2000, from 75 percent this year. But they could have a big impact on urban air pollution.</p>
        <p>Cars have proved an easier problem to tackle. As of Jan. 1, Beijing has banned the sale of leaded gas, and as of next year all new cars must have catalytic converters. The police recently started spot checks of tailpipe emissions, and fewer than 40 percent of cars tested on the first day passed. Polluting owners have their licenses revoked and are instructed to install catalytic converters, at a cost of about $100.</p>
        <p>Beijing has long required yearly emission checks, but enforcing such laws is difficult. In a poor country like China, there is persistent tension between wanting cleaner air and not having the money to pay for it.</p>
