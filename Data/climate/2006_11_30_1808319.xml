        <p>THE $100 LAPTOP A nonprofit project to build a $100 laptop for children in the developing world is winning over many skeptics. Five countries have made tentative commitments to put the computers into the hands of millions of students, with production in Taiwan expected to begin by mid-2007. [Page A1.]</p>
        <p>HARD TIMES FOR WAL-MART Wal-Mart is expected to announce next week that sales for November fell for the first time in a decade, leading some industry experts to wonder whether the retailer is changing too fast, acting more like a start-up than a 44-year-old company with 6,000 stores, 1.3 million employees and sales of $312 billion. [A1.]</p>
        <p>GAUGING THE IMPACT OF $4 DRUGS Wal-Mart says that its $4 generic drug program is attracting new customers to its stores and starting the nation on a road that will squeeze billions of dollars from prescription drug spending. But two months into the program, it is unclear whether Wal-Mart is meeting its stated goal of making a profit on those drugs. [C1.]</p>
        <p>BUYOUTS COSTLY FOR FORD The Ford Motor Company expects to burn through $17 billion -- nearly half of its cash reserves -- by 2009, mostly in the next year as 40 percent of its hourly workers voluntarily leave their jobs. [C1.]</p>
        <p>WORRIES OVER KIDNEY DRUGS An expert panel of doctors for the National Kidney Foundation plans to assess whether hundreds of thousands of patients with kidney disease are being dangerously overtreated with drugs for anemia. [C1.]</p>
        <p>TROUBLE WITH PATROL BOATS After spending $100 million to renovate eight of its workhorse cutters, the Coast Guard will announce that it is suspending the use of the Florida-based patrol boats because of chronic hull cracking and engine problems. [A22.]</p>
        <p>CARBON DIOXIDE ON TRIAL A Supreme Court argument on the Bush administration's refusal to regulate carbon dioxide in automobile emissions offered three intertwined plot lines to the audience that had come to watch the court's first encounter with the issue of global climate change. [A23.]</p>
        <p>A NEW CLASS SYSTEM India, once divided chiefly by caste, is creating a different divide by skills. Those with marketable skills are sought for service call centers and software houses; those without are ensnared in drudgery. [C3.]</p>
        <p>VERIZON PLAYS HOST Verizon's newest store in Southlake, Tex., lets consumers play the latest video game, practice downloading music or kick back and watch football in high-definition, making Verizon the latest electronics retailer to open an outlet that feels more like an arcade than a phone store. Advertising. [C3.]</p>
        <p>EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHERS IN DEAL Riverdeep Holdings, an Irish maker of educational software, agreed to acquire the American textbook publisher Houghton Mifflin for $1.75 billion. [C9.]</p>
        <p>AUSTRALIA BALKS AT BIDS A recent flurry of multibillion-dollar takeover bids by international buyers for Australian companies has touched a nationalistic nerve and drawn some calls for a more protectionist government stance. [C13.]</p>
        <p>SHARES RALLY Wall Street rallied for a second consecutive session after the government's latest gross domestic product reading showed the economy was in better shape than expected, easing concerns that growth was slowing too sharply. [C15.]</p>
        <p>GRASSO REQUESTS JUDGE'S REMOVAL Richard A. Grasso, the former New York Stock Exchange chairman, has asked an appeals court to remove the judge presiding over a lawsuit seeking the return of some of his $190 million pay package from the Big Board. [C15.]</p>
        <p>A PROPOSAL TO SCALE BACK RULES An independent committee formed with the endorsement of Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., left, will call today for a sweeping overhaul of securities market regulations, including making it harder for companies to be indicted by the government or sued by private lawyers. [C1.]</p>
        <p>SOARING PROFITS FOR INSURERS Auto insurance companies are reaping extraordinary profits from rising premiums in New York City, even as they pay out less in claims, because state regulators have not adequately policed the industry, according to a report released by the city comptroller. [B5.]</p>
        <p>ONLINE</p>
        <p>DIGITAL HOLIDAYS Designers and engineers have come up with enticing new devices, and scores of them are set to reach the store shelves in time for the holiday shoppers. A special report is at nytimes.com/technology/circuits.</p>

        <p>An article on these developments are at nytimes.com/business.</p>
        <p>YAHOO HAS REBUFFED Google's attempt to learn more about its efforts to create digital copies of books, dealing Google another setback as it prepares to fight a copyright infringement suit. In rejecting Google's request, Yahoo adopted the same stance taken last month by the Internet retailer Amazon.com, and called Google's request a brazen attempt to pry into its trade secrets. (AP)</p>
