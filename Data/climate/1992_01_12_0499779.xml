        <p>AS THE GREAT WHALE River rises east out of Hudson Bay in northeastern Canada, its broad sandy shores quickly give way to a carpet of light-green lichen studded with granite outcroppings. Beyond the banks lies a vast expanse of black spruce and tamarack, great coniferous forests broken here and there by lakes and bogs and kettle ponds. In winter, the taiga can be harsh and remorseless, a region racked by "wind, snow and natural violence of every sort," as an adventurer described it a half-century ago. But it is also a landscape that teems with life in fall and spring, when enormous herds of caribous stomp across the earth and millions of migratory birds tarry in the estuaries of James and Hudson Bays, some stopping to double their weight as they feast on eelgrass and coastal shrimp before flying as far south as Tierra del Fuego. It is quiet in summer: on an August evening there is utter silence in the northern Quebec bush, save for the rippling of the river or the honking of a pair of geese overhead in a salmon-colored sky.</p>
        <p>This subarctic wilderness is, in any season, an unlikely subject of an international controversy. But that is precisely what it has become hundreds of miles away, in southern Quebec and in New York State's capital, Albany, where the central question about the Great Whale River basin is this: Should large parts of it be underwater?</p>
        <p>Hydro-Quebec, a utility owned by the province of Quebec, envisions flooding the Great Whale as the second of three phases in a planned hydroelectric power system of colossal proportions. To harness the kinetic energy in 20 wild rivers, Hydro-Quebec plans to erect three dozen huge dams and hundreds of dikes across the taiga, ultimately redrawing terrain in an area the size of France.</p>
        <p>Affecting the regions east of James Bay and southeast of Hudson Bay, the James Bay development project would be one of the largest hydroelectric complexes in the world, churning turbines with a dozen times the force of Niagara Falls. It would easily rank as one of the largest construction projects ever undertaken.</p>
        <p>The work already completed in the first phase of the project, south of the Great Whale basin and known as the LaGrande River complex, used enough fill to build the Great Pyramid of Cheops 80 times over. A feat like diverting the Caniapiscau River, so that it flowed west into James Bay, rather than northeast into Ungava Bay, as it had for eons, was considered a routine engineering matter, hardly worthy of comment -- until 1984, that is, when 10,000 migratory caribous died in its raging waters.</p>
        <p>In Phase 2, Hydro-Quebec intends to push north into the Great Whale area and, in Phase 3, plans to divert the Nottaway and the Rupert Rivers into the Broadback River, storing the water in seven new reservoirs, sending it through 11 powerhouses and transforming the lower parts of the diverted rivers into dry bedrock. With all phases completed, sometime after the turn of the century, the project would produce 26,400 megawatts of electrical power, of which 15 percent would be available for export.</p>
        <p>But Quebec's expansive plans are drawing bitter resistance from native Cree Indians, concerned about preserving the land and traditional Indian ways of life, as well as from environmentalists, who warn of impending ecological disaster. And, while the Quebecois tend to see hydropower as the province's pathway to economic, and possibly political, independence from the rest of Canada, there is a competing claim. The native people in the north -- there are about 12,000 Crees and 6,000 Inuit Eskimos living in the James Bay region -- say that if Francophone Quebec gains recognition as a "distinct society," they should be granted the same recognition and more authority over what happens to their land. Indeed, the Canadian Government lent renewed force to their argument last month, when it said it would grant the Inuits control over nearly two-thirds of the Northwest Territories, an area to be known as Nunavut.</p>
        <p>And James Bay is the object of an increasingly fierce debate in New York, where Gov. Mario M. Cuomo must decide within the next year whether to go ahead with a 20-year, $19.5 billion contract to buy some of this power from the Canadian north.</p>
        <p>At first glance, the agreement seems like the perfect match of Quebec's supply and New York's demand. By early next century, if the plan goes through, 10 to 12 percent of the state's electricity (compared with about 2 percent today) would come soaring down high-voltage lines from the taiga and into electrical outlets from Massena to Manhattan to Montauk.</p>
        <p>Yet opponents have raised a number of disturbing questions that already have forced New York officials to postpone the decision once. Is the importing of "clean" hydropower the salvation of a state that has labored unsuccessfully to comply with Federal clean-air standards? Or is it simply tantamount to exporting environmental and cultural destruction to the taiga, the ultimate not-in-my-backyard solution to New York's energy needs? Will energy demand truly rise by 2 to 3 percent a year, as was forecast a few years ago, before the growth in demand slowed in the face of the current recession? And, finally, should New York not in any case try harder to meet its energy needs through conservation?</p>
        <p>By virtue of its financial clout, New York will cast what many analysts say is the decisive vote on Great Whale. Hydro-Quebec officials insist that they will go ahead with the $50 billion to $60 billion project no matter what New York decides. The only effect, they say, will be to delay it for a few years. But less-interested observers doubt that Quebec can proceed without the contract and the capital it represents. "The whole essence of James Bay 2 depends on export sales," says Ihor Kots, managing director of Canadian Bond Rating Service Inc., the largest credit-rating service in Canada. "The electricity demand in Quebec won't be sufficient to take up the capacity for years to come. If there is not demand from elsewhere, it would add considerably to the financial risk."</p>
        <p>WHILE HYDROPOWER HAS LONG BEEN TOUTED AS clean and cheaper than any other available source of power, virtually everyone involved in the James Bay dispute agrees that this is no longer completely true. Given current long-range projections for energy costs, the New York State Energy Office says the Quebec power would actually cost slightly more than electricity generated from oil, coal and natural gas. This could change, however, if New York, as some state officials predict, succeeds in negotiating a lower price with Hydro-Quebec this year.</p>
        <p>For the moment, though, the debate about James Bay turns primarily on environmental questions. Proponents of hydropower purchases, including the New York Power Authority, warn of increased fossil-fuel pollution if the contract is rejected. They cite an energy office study that shows emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide rising by 7 percent, 10.4 percent and 6.1 percent respectively in New York, without the hydropower. And, they point out, some of this pollution would be transported across the border and deposited on Canadian territory.</p>
        <p>Critics insist that the only sure way to reduce pollution and avoid environmental destruction is to conserve energy use. Jeffrey Wollock, the executive director of the New York City-based James Bay Defense Coalition, a group representing 24 environmental and native rights organizations, calls the James Bay contracts "a case of exporting New York's environmental problems to another part of the planet. This is not environmentalism, but pseudo-environmentalism."</p>
        <p>Hydro-Quebec's brochures stress its commitment to building "in harmony with nature," and feature pictures of Hydro-Quebec workers carefully airlifting animals to safety from islands created by the flooding. Nevertheless, the utility is fighting an uphill battle to improve its image, especially after the caribou disaster in the Caniapiscau River.</p>
        <p>The mass drowning happened to occur the first year the reservoirs were full enough to require controlled releases down the riverway. Hydro-Quebec claims that, because of the torrential rains that year, the caribous very likely would have died anyway, and notes that the overall caribou population in the James Bay region has increased in the last 20 years. But the natives and some biologists insist that the mass drownings would never have occurred if the river had been left alone.</p>
        <p>The most profound, but also most problematic, questions involve long-term threats to the James Bay region as the subarctic habitat is altered on such a dramatic scale.</p>
        <p>Hydro-Quebec insists that the overall impact will be minimal, that humans and animals will adapt and that no animal species is threatened with extinction. Environmentalists paint drastic scenarios. Jan Beyea, chief scientist at the National Audubon Society, has concluded that "in terms of wildlife and habitat, the devastation of James Bay is the northern equivalent of the destruction of the tropical rain forest." Others say New York should back out of James Bay simply to avoid becoming "an accomplice to the crime," in the words of William B. Hoyt, a Buffalo Democrat who is chairman of the State Assembly's energy committee and a principal opponent.</p>
        <p>The New York Power Authority has vigorously insisted to Hydro-Quebec that New York wants a proper environmental review of the project, and Canadian Federal officials have also vowed to monitor Quebec's plans. Still, some state officials have protested that cancellation of the contracts on ecological grounds would amount to drastic interference in Canada's internal affairs. But that is precisely what the Cree opponents are requesting.</p>
        <p>"How can we expect the Quebec government to be fair?" asks Chief Robbie Dick, the band, or tribal, chief for the Crees of Whapmagoostui (also called Kuujjuarapik, in Inuit), the village at the mouth of the Great Whale River. "They are the proponents and the analyzers, the judge and the jury."</p>
        <p>The James Bay dispute involves starkly conflicting visions of the landscape. "Who would consider the total elimination of the Hudson River?" Matthew Coon Come, the chief of the Grand Council of the Cree, asked a United Nations panel last year. "Yet great rivers have been destroyed where my people live."</p>
        <p>Yet Robert Bourassa, the Quebec premier and original mastermind of James Bay, looks at the wilderness and sees kilowatts vital to the province's future. Northern Quebec, he wrote in a 1985 book, "Power from the North," is a "vast hydroelectric project-in-the-bud, and every day millions of potential kilowatt hours flow downhill and out to the sea. What a waste!"</p>
        <p>THERE IS ONE POINT ON WHICH JUST ABOUT everybody involved in the clash over James Bay concurs: Hydro-Quebec knows how to build hydroelectric power plants, gargantuan structures that attract astounded engineers from all over the world.</p>
        <p>There is the enormous dam, known as LaGrande 2, whose 16 turbines 450 feet below the surface of the water generate enough thrust to power 50 Boeing 747's at takeoff. And there is LaGrande 2-A, called the "baby sister," a generating station still under construction, whose 2,000 megawatts will be more powerful than the combined output of all the gas- and oil-fired plants and the single nuclear reactor in Quebec. (A megawatt is a million watts, or the power needed to light 10,000 100-watt electrical bulbs. A suburban shopping mall with 100 stores or so draws roughly 3 megawatts, the towers of the World Trade Center use about 32 megawatts each.) A few miles from LaGrande 2-A, across the reservoir, is a giant spillway blasted out of the rock and capable of carrying the combined flows of all the rivers of Europe (excluding the territory of the former Soviet Union).</p>
        <p>Sixty-eight people died in construction accidents during the 13 years it took to build the first phase of the LaGrande project. Hydro-Quebec is quick to assert, however, that given the 150 million man-hours involved, this actually represents one of the best safety records for a major construction project in North American history.</p>
        <p>Hydro-Quebec, which generates 95 percent of the province's electrical power and accounts for 5 percent of gross domestic product, has become a kind of adopted stepchild of Bourassa, the Quebec premier. He was in office to make the 1971 announcement kicking off the first phase of the project and, after an interval in political exile, returned to announce James Bay 2 in 1988.</p>
        <p>The fantastic plans the Premier has already made for James Bay pale beside his grandest vision. In a project that would cost well more than $100 billion and that is not likely to be taken seriously until decades into the next century, if ever, Bourassa has advocated transforming James Bay into an enormous freshwater lake by erecting a dike across its mouth -- a distance of 100 miles. From there the water would be pumped through a series of enormous channels to the arid stretches of the Great Plains, the American Southwest and California. Bourassa has referred to his plan simply as the "Grand Canal."</p>
        <p>STILL, WHILE NO ONE questions Hydro-Quebec's technical prowess, the company has enjoyed far less success in assuaging concerns about the environmental toll. These range from the still-disputed caribou drowning in 1984 to undisputed releases of toxic methyl mercury, which have led to limits on the consumption of fish in the region, a staple in the diets of the Crees and Inuits.</p>
        <p>As vegetation decomposes underwater, bacteria transform mercury -- a common and harmless component of soil and vegetation -- into a toxic methylated form that is absorbed by fish, which then become dangerous to eat. A 1984 study of the Cree village of Chisasibi, downstream from the LaGrande complex, found that 64 percent of the residents had methyl mercury levels classified as unsafe by the World Health Organization. Methyl mercury is thought to cause numerous birth defects, including palsy and retardation, as well as stillbirths and convulsions.</p>
        <p>Hydro-Quebec officials concede that methyl mercury will continue to be a problem for 25 to 30 years at LaGrande and, if it is flooded, Great Whale. Yet, through medication and strict limits on the consumption of predatory fish like trout and pike, they say, the incidence of unsafe mercury levels among residents of Chisasibi has been reduced to 30 percent since the 1984 study.</p>
        <p>But the talk of limits on fish angers the Crees. "Telling us that we'll be O.K. if we don't eat fish is like telling us that we will be O.K. if we just cut our own legs off," says Andrew Natachequan, a Cree elder in the village of Whapmagoostui.</p>
        <p>Hydro-Quebec has invested $18.5 million in studies for a methyl-mercury advisory committee. But other than coming up with the consumption limits and suggesting the Crees might turn a profit by grinding fish into commercial fertilizer, the committee has been largely stumped.</p>
        <p>Longer-range questions about the effect of the construction on the James Bay habitat remain, in many ways, unresolved.</p>
        <p>A number of Canadian and American environmental organizations argue that cumulative changes will have unpredictable and in some cases devastating consequences. For one thing, the James Bay project has already succeeded in reversing the normal flow of water in many of the dammed rivers. Water now runs faster in the winter, corresponding to the peak demand for electricity in Quebec (where more than 70 percent of homes use electric heat), and slower at other times as the water is stored in reservoirs. This means that coastal marshes and tidal flats have fewer nutrients in spring and fall, the times of heaviest migration, when many birds must eat voraciously to prepare for their flights. The scene at James Bay during such times has been described as a "rite of gluttony."</p>
        <p>These migrants "may have no substitute habitat if key sites in James Bay are destroyed," according to a study of the area released in November by the National Audubon Society. The report further states that "many species of migratory shore birds would be severely threatened, possibly even to extinction, if a crucial stopover area were damaged."</p>
        <p>Gaetan Guertin, director of environmental studies for Hydro-Quebec, asserts that any animals displaced by the flooding or the man-made reservoirs would thrive elsewhere in the area. While acknowledging that the company does not keep specific counts of species populations in the James Bay region, he insists that little damage will be done. "We have enough data, and we're very confident in the quality of our data, that our predictions will be borne out," he says. "They show that it's not a disaster there."</p>
        <p>Hydro-Quebec further notes that all three projects together would flood only about 1.5 percent of the dry land in the James Bay region. But that figure still amounts to an area nearly the size of New Jersey, and it does not include the lakes and ponds swallowed up by the new reservoirs. Finally, for all the concern about flooding, the project's many diversions would also turn hundreds of miles of roaring riverways into dry riverbeds.</p>
        <p>THE ELECTRICITY GENERATED IN THE Canadian north races down the transmission lines that stretch like forests of steel across the taiga, into New York State and ultimately across a grid that reaches into every home, apartment, factory and office in the state. Under a 1978 contract with Hydro-Quebec, New York buys anywhere from 800 to 1,000 megawatts during the peak demand period of the year, from April 1 to Nov. 1. The new contracts would extend this arrangement to the year 2018, and add a new year-round commitment of 1,000 megawatts beginning in 1995.</p>
        <p>The question of whether New York State "needs" the James Bay hydropower is, on one level, unanswerable. Public utilities have achieved substantial energy savings in recent years through "demand-side management" practices pushed by the chairman of the state's Public Service Commission, Peter A. Bradford. Demand management includes both conservation and the manipulation of rates to discourage use during peak daylight hours and to encourage use during slack times at night.</p>
        <p>These measures, coupled with the lengthy recession, have worked. As recently as two and a half years ago, Consolidated Edison, which serves New York City and neighboring Westchester County and is the state's largest utility, was projecting annual consumption increases of between 2 and 3 percent. Now the utility says it will meet all demand growth in coming years through demand management. And one official for the Long Island Lighting Company, at a rate-setting case before the P.S.C. last spring, said the utility appeared to be "reaching the point where we may have too much power," even after the closing of the Shoreham nuclear plant.</p>
        <p>But many state energy planners caution that such optimism can extend only for the next few years. After that, with a hoped-for return to robust economic growth and the phasing out of New York's dirtiest fossil-fuel plants, the picture will be far more uncertain. And in any event, they say, even if conservation measures could succeed beyond anyone's wildest imagination, tapping Quebec's hydropower is still a lot better than burning fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>And even as total consumption appears to be flattening out, there is another ominous measure of electricity use that keeps rising. That is the figure for "peak demand," which typically comes on a sweltering summer day, when nearly everybody seems to stay close to an air-conditioner. New York State set a new all-time record this July with a peak demand of 26,839 megawatts. Without adequate reserves, officials warn, technicians may some day have no choice but to impose widespread brownouts and blackouts at the worst possible time.</p>
        <p>Opponents of the contract are skeptical of this doomsday scenario. In any event, some energy analysts contend it would be cheaper for New York to pay for an energy-conservation program in Quebec and then to import the freed-up electricity than for Hydro-Quebec to build Great Whale.</p>
        <p>HARDLY A THOUSAND people live in the wind-swept village at the mouth of the Great Whale River. But in a reflection of the polyglot culture there, it has the distinction of being known by four names: Great Whale, in English; Poste-de-la-Baleine, in French; Whapmagoostui, in Cree; and Kuujjuarapik, in Inuit. Europeans settled there a few hundred years ago -- first arriving as missionaries and traders at the outpost of the Hudson's Bay Company. Another group arrived in the mid-1950's, to help build and maintain a huge airstrip for the Canadian Air Force.</p>
        <p>Great Whale is an odd mix in another way. Most people live in trailerlike housing with all the modern conveniences, but they are more likely than not to have a canoe or a tepee in the backyard. And while about half the Cree natives still go miles out into the bush for months at a time to fish, hunt and trap, they often fly out there in floatplanes operated by a Cree-owned airline, Air Wemindje. "It's really a lot easier that way," explains Robbie Dick, the local council chief.</p>
        <p>But the placid patterns of life in the village have been shattered in recent years as the Crees and Inuits, alarmed by the LaGrande hydro development to the south, have geared up to fight the Great Whale project. It is in many ways a different battle than the one waged by the Crees and a smaller number of Inuits in the mid-1970's over LaGrande, when no public hearings were held on the project outside of a lawsuit filed by native leaders against Hydro-Quebec. After months of hearings and a trial in which lawyers spoke in French, English, Cree and Inuktituk, the Inuit tongue, a Quebec Superior Court Judge shocked the province by ruling in favor of the natives and ordering a halt to construction.</p>
        <p>Within a week, though, an appeals court had overturned the ruling. In 1975, with many natives now accepting the LaGrande project as inevitable, Cree, Inuit and Quebec officials signed the landmark James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement. In return for allowing construction to be completed on the first phase, the Crees and Inuits received more than $170 million in land-use compensation, including trapping subsidies, government housing financing, mineral-rights royalties and hospitals -- and even a network of snowmobile trails. The pact also called for an environmental review and consultation with the natives on any future development in the James Bay region.</p>
        <p>In light of the agreement, some Quebec officials have suggested that the native peoples' opposition to Great Whale is simply a tactic designed to gain another generous compensation package. But the Crees insist that they were misled about the ecological and sociological effects of LaGrande, which brought into their area tens of thousands of Quebecois workers and, with them, all the attributes -- good and bad -- of modern life. If they had known what was coming, they now say, they would never have signed the agreement.</p>
        <p>The Inuits' opposition is not quite so adamant, possibly because they have not been as severely affected by development as have the Crees. While many do indeed object to further development, at least two Inuit communities have elected mayors in the past year who argue that the James Bay project is unstoppable, and that the Inuits should negotiate another deal with Hydro-Quebec.</p>
        <p>Curiously, both the Cree and Quebec officials cite the same evidence as proof of their diametrically opposed views on the social effects of development: Chisasibi, the village at the mouth of the LaGrande, 165 miles south of Great Whale.</p>
        <p>Development has brought some undeniable benefits to the 2,500 people there, most of them Crees. Infant mortality is significantly down compared with 30 years ago, life expectancy is up and tuberculosis, which used to ravage whole communities, is almost unheard of. Almost everyone lives in comfortable, modern houses; from the air, in fact, Chisasibi looks like a miniature Levittown on the taiga. There is a hockey rink, a post office and a shopping mall.</p>
        <p>But there are also alcoholism, drug abuse, sexually transmitted diseases, family violence and suicides, all of which the Crees say scarcely existed a generation ago. And many of the Cree leaders find it distressing that elders and young people alike, once resourceful enough to survive winters in the bush, can now be found idling in the mall, playing checkers or eating junk food.</p>
        <p>"What we have said is that yes, our life is in many ways much easier now than it used to be," says Violet Pachanos, elected chief of the Chisasibi band council. "But we are also prey to all the social diseases of the south. We are no longer in control of our lives."</p>
        <p>Back in Great Whale, the protests against James Bay have occasionally turned militant, and some leaders have warned they will become increasingly so. For example, in June, a team of Hydro-Quebec engineers who had come for an Inuit-sponsored hearing on the hydroelectric project was blockaded by a crowd of Crees at the Great Whale airport. The officials left on the same plane, after native leaders said they could not guarantee their safety.</p>
        <p>The anger so evident in these incidents is also softened by a sense of irony. For example, when asked what kinds of progress had come to his village since he was a boy, Sappa Fleming, the former Mayor of the Inuit in Great Whale, says, "Well, my children can choose from six different kinds of potato chips at the Northern," referring to the local store that is a direct descendant of the Hudson's Bay Company outpost. "I suppose that is a kind of progress."</p>
        <p>IN COMING MONTHS, officials and politicians in Quebec and New York will try to balance their best estimates of future electricity demand, based on shaky forecasts, against the expected environmental effects of the James Bay project, which past experience shows are unpredictable. They will try to balance the rights and needs of native people, and of animals with exotic names like the beluga, bufflehead, Eskimo curlew and Hudsonian godwit, against the rights and needs of city dwellers. In the end, they will try to answer one of the basic questions of North American history: Do the land and its natural inhabitants have certain rights that outweigh the demands of urban, industrial society?</p>
        <p>Canadian and New York officials will weigh Bourassa's assertion that James Bay represents "the means of liberating Quebec's people," economically and politically, against the observation of the Cree chief, Robbie Dick, that if the Great Whale project comes about, "we'll lose part of our lives, because the land is our life."</p>
        <p>The rivers and lakes of northern Quebec can be harnessed to suit the demands of humans and to relieve ecological strains elsewhere. Or the taiga, the largest stretch of wilderness left in eastern North America, can simply be left alone. But in James Bay, you cannot have it both ways.</p>
