        <p>When the Al Gore documentary ''An Inconvenient Truth'' received an Academy Award last week, it seemed a pretty sure sign that Hollywood believes that global climate change is taking place. But what about the rest of the world? Prompted by a New York winter that went from disturbing warmth to bone-chilling cold practically overnight, the Op-Ed page asked four writers from different corners of the globe to report on the erratic weather they've been experiencing. Here are their dispatches.</p>
        <p>THE sun was finally back in late January, and I thought, when it shines again it might even be yellow. (When the sun returns to the Arctic, you stare at it like a lost love.) But the sky was still gray, the temperature was 5 below (what we call ''warm''), and the west wind was drifting snow off the sea ice. The ice was not as thick or plentiful as it should be at that time of year.</p>

        <p>When the Al Gore documentary ''An Inconvenient Truth'' received an Academy Award last week, it seemed a pretty sure sign that Hollywood believes that global climate change is taking place. But what about the rest of the world? Prompted by a New York winter that went from disturbing warmth to bone-chilling cold practically overnight, the Op-Ed page asked four writers from different corners of the globe to report on the erratic weather they've been experiencing. Here are their dispatches.</p>
        <p>THE sun was finally back in late January, and I thought, when it shines again it might even be yellow. (When the sun returns to the Arctic, you stare at it like a lost love.) But the sky was still gray, the temperature was 5 below (what we call ''warm''), and the west wind was drifting snow off the sea ice. The ice was not as thick or plentiful as it should be at that time of year.</p>
        <p>Late January marks the beginning of good winter travel, and I was impatient to be out. At 10 a.m. I lashed snowshoes, camera bag and tools to my snowmobile. The snow-scoured town droned with the beat of the power plant, auto engines and four-wheelers and the tortured roar of high-performance snowmobiles driven by lawless teenagers (some in their 40s).</p>
        <p>My husky came sleepily out of his doghouse, stepped over giant, gnawed moose bones and stretched to the end of his chain, wagging his tail, wanting to go with me. Though it was still twilight, I felt pressed not to waste light. To take photographs in winter you must be close to caribou or wolves or whatever you're shooting when the light arrives. In past winters, the caribou herds have been nearer to town, but this year has been different.</p>
        <p>While the snowmobile engine warmed up, I hurried inside for the rest of my gear: parka and fur hat, face mask and goggles, binoculars and beaver mittens.</p>
        <p>The sky here has lost its hard-earned trust; the weather has always been unpredictable, but who knows anymore, the temperature could plummet or, worse, it could rain. Here in winter we fear water most of all.</p>
        <p>It is good that our uncertain ''freezeup'' -- our word for the season that divides summer and water from winter and ice -- is behind us, with the ice forming and then rethawing, with that strange rain in October that felt like Oregon weather but with extra darkness, with thin ice in November and temperatures in the teens into December. It was nice too that an early January storm and minus-35 weather had passed. We've been spoiled by warm weather, and yet we are worried watching the Arctic melt.</p>
        <p>One cold spell and people were already talking about ''global cooling.'' It turned cold again the first week of February, and has been relentlessly 15 to 30 below since. But not everyone remembers the deep freezes of decades past when inland winters regularly dipped to minus 60, and here on the coast minus 100 wind chill was common. What we are left with now is a suspicion about what the sky will bring, and what new bugs and birds may fly in under it.</p>
        <p>Cold matters here; we travel long distances on snow and ice. Think of driving from Washington to New York and wondering the whole way if the road will melt. These days, everyone here knows or is related to someone who has drowned by falling through thin ice.</p>
        <p>Out on Kotzebue Sound snowdrifts slowed my travel. After 15 miles I left the ice, climbed up onto the tundra and crossed the fresh tracks of two other snowmobiles. Kotzebue is a town of hunters, the tradition going back 10,000 years, before rifles and aircraft, and though times have changed and brought NBC and ''CSI,'' Gore-Tex and FedEx and every other thing to the Arctic, caribou remain the meat of choice.</p>
        <p>The land stretched into rising, rolling tundra dotted with clumps of brush (brush that is very happy, thank you, with the last 10 years of late falls and melting permafrost). Occasional stands of spruce marked tributaries and south-facing slopes. The spruce, too, are moving north, trailing new thickets of cute green babies along the way.</p>
        <p>The snow was trackless. In the ringing of the engine my thoughts wandered ahead and behind. In autumn, sometimes 50,000 caribou come through this area. Caribou here are like wild ducks; they migrate at predictable times -- south in September, north in May. They provide food and in the process define the seasons. But this past season was a strange and lean one; caribou delayed migrating until after freezeup. Many folks believe this happened because of our warmer falls; most also heap blame on the recent invasion of another species -- swarms of sport hunters from the lower 48 states whose camps block the trails, and who do not know or follow the local custom of not shooting the leaders of the caribou migration.</p>
        <p>But it was January, and finally cold. Down in a buried creek, I found the first footprints of wild creatures -- a fox, and then ptarmigan. Four ptarmigan burst out of the willows, their feathers white on white, as if chunks of the snow itself had sprung to life. On a rise I shut off my machine and with cold fingers put my camera together. The land was growing lighter, hushed, empty. A thousand distant brush clumps looked like caribou but were not. To the south were bands of orange. To the north, mountains rose into low, gray falling snow.</p>
