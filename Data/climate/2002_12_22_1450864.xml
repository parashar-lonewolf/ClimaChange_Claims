        <p>With autumn fishing winding down, most anglers have hung up their tackle, winterized their boats, and begun their annual hibernation from outdoor pursuits. But for others, the long wait is nearly over, as they eagerly ready their toothpick rods and toy-sized reels.

        <p>While warm-weather anglers pine through the winter months, gazing forlornly through frost-covered glasses, jiggermen cheer on Alberta clippers and hoot and holler as the mercury rattles around the ball of the thermometer like a frozen pea. Their conversations are restricted to meaningful debates on fishing the hardwater, like the merits of tipping one's jigs with either waxworms or mousies -- a type of fly larvae (read: maggot).</p>

        <p>While warm-weather anglers pine through the winter months, gazing forlornly through frost-covered glasses, jiggermen cheer on Alberta clippers and hoot and holler as the mercury rattles around the ball of the thermometer like a frozen pea. Their conversations are restricted to meaningful debates on fishing the hardwater, like the merits of tipping one's jigs with either waxworms or mousies -- a type of fly larvae (read: maggot).</p>
        <p>Last winter, however, the wait was interminable for most jiggermen, myself included. Blame it on El Ni√±o or global warming, but most lakes in the Northeast remained ice-free for the entire season. I remember watching the Weather Channel and tracking polar air masses, only to watch them fizzle out somewhere over the Great Lakes.</p>
        <p>The sled I had rigged for ice fishing, complete with rod holders, a bucket for sitting and even a space for my thermos, remained by the back door like an anxious puppy waiting to be let outside. By mid-January, it was covered with dust instead of snow or ice.</p>
        <p>Yet I did manage one ice-fishing trip at the end of last season, and it turned out to be worth the wait. My friend John McMurray called me in early March with an invitation to fish a private pond in southern Massachusetts. I half thought he was joking, but he promised that it not only had adequate ice from a cold snap a week earlier, but it also contained some of the largest yellow perch he had ever seen. This was all the prompting I needed.</p>
        <p>Jumbo yellow perch -- called jackperch or cows -- are the jiggermen's most prized catch. Forget pickerel as long as your arm, forget giant largemouth bass whose bloated bellies barely fit through the ice-hole. To a jiggerman, a 14-inch-jackperch with black eyes, and a humped back streaked with deep olive bars is as good as it gets.</p>
        <p>But it must be caught on a jigging rod the size and strength of a twig, and a tiny reel spooled with two-pound line. Then it should be filleted -- preferably with several of its friends -- dipped in egg, dredged in Italian bread crumbs and fried in peanut oil until it turns golden brown and crunchy. Leave the bass for humid summer evenings and popping bugs, the pickerel for weedy bays and streamers.</p>
        <p>When I joined John on the pond that miraculous day, it was as if I had stumbled onto a scene straight out of Currier and Ives. McMurray and his friend Ted Williams stood sentinel over carefully chopped ice holes. Already a few perch lay scattered on the ice, some well over a pound and a half. A light snow fell, as if sent down by Old Man Winter himself, dusting the boughs of a few white pines on the far side of the pond.</p>
        <p>Williams is a hard-core jiggerman and ice-fishing purist. He proudly uses a homemade ice chisel to chop holes, shunning conventional augers. He mostly fishes with a Swedish Pimple -- a lure that's to ice fishing and perch what the Adams is to trout streams and brookies. He sweetens the end of his hooks with the eye of a perch, claiming that the scent triggers reluctant cow-perch into biting.</p>
        <p>I remember Ted's hooking a particularly big perch while I readied my tackle. ''There's another,'' he called out, snapping the rod upward. Then, like a bear swatting a salmon from a stream, he snatched the fish from the hole. ''That's a cow,'' he said, holding the nearly two-pound fish. By then, I had threaded a wax worm onto my jig, and lowered it to the bottom. I then began the ever-so-gentle jigging action that triggers perch into mouthing the lure.</p>
        <p>A fly-fisherman might boast that a trout sipping a spinner is the most subtle take in all of angling. But compared with a perch inhaling a jig below the ice, trout feed with all the finesse of a blue marlin smashing a trolled bonito. At best, perch hits are barely perceptible -- the line may quiver once, or go slack, or slowly inch to one side of the hole. Sometimes the rod tip hiccups a fraction of an inch.</p>
        <p>I lightly jigged the rod again, felt a slight increase in weight, and lifted. The rod immediately jerked downward, thumping in time to the head shakes of a nice perch. The fish then ran away from the hole, bending the little rod and peeling line from the reel. I quickly dropped the rod tip into the water to prevent line from chafing on a sharp edge in the ice. A few seconds later, the head of a jumbo perch poked into the daylight. I grabbed the fish around the midsection and flipped it onto the ice. The jackperch stared blankly, its dark sides and orange fins contrasting sharply with the newly fallen snow. Taking Ted's cue, I quickly snapped its back and placed it on the ice, where it lay still.</p>
        <p>For the rest of the day, the fishing continued at a slow pick. Mixed in with the perch were several two-pound largemouth bass and a few nice-sized pickerel -- prized any other time, but on the hardwater, little more than unwanted thugs that we quickly released.</p>
        <p>At last light, four more perch came up over a 10-minute period, including two that pushed 15 inches.</p>
        <p>Finally, at dark the action shut down completely. With snow continuing to fall, we gathered up about a dozen jackperch from the ice -- not a huge catch, but a welcome respite from an otherwise ice-free winter, which to jiggermen, can be particularly long and cruel.</p>
