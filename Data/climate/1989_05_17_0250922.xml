        <p>LEAD: For two decades, economists have tried and failed to make their mark on America's effort to clean up the environment. Now, for the first time, their arguments are finding a receptive audience at the White House, where President Bush's aides are drafting legislation on acid rain.</p>
        <p>For two decades, economists have tried and failed to make their mark on America's effort to clean up the environment. Now, for the first time, their arguments are finding a receptive audience at the White House, where President Bush's aides are drafting legislation on acid rain.</p>
        <p>The legislation would allow companies to buy and sell the right to pollute and thus let the market decide the cheapest way to contain smokestack emissions. It is rated by one White House official at having a ''better than even money'' chance of passing Congress. Such a victory for economists would change the thrust of anti-pollution efforts for decades to come.</p>
        <p>To a generation of environmental advocates hardened by trench warfare with business, the only good polluter is a repentant polluter. But to economists, pollution is a necessary evil: the best way to cope with it is to figure out how much is too much and then let private markets decide who can clean it up most efficiently. This market-based approach has also gained powerful allies in Congress and even in environmental groups. Agreement on Cause and Effect</p>
        <p>After a decade of investigation, there is no longer any serious dissent from the view that acid rain is largely caused by sulfur emissions from coal- and oil-burning electric power plants. Nor is there much doubt that acid rain is damaging forests and lakes in the Northeast and Canada. President Bush, reversing the stance of the Reagan Administration, has pledged to support some sort of legislation to reduce those emissions.</p>
        <p>The strategy long favored by most Congressional Democrats and environmental groups is to set a limit on the amount of sulfur that can be emitted by utility boilers.</p>
        <p>Many utilities, it was assumed, would meet the standard by switching from high-sulfur coal extracted by members of the United Mine Workers in the East and Midwest to low-sulfur coal from the West, coal largely mined by nonunion workers.</p>
        <p>Thus, to win the support of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and coal-state members of Congress, proponents of acid-rain legislation have generally agreed that some plants should be denied the option to use low-sulfur coal. These plants would be required to use ''scrubbers,'' special equipment on smokestacks that removes sulfur by a chemical reaction.</p>
        <p>One such proposal, the 1988 bill sponsored by Senator George J. Mitchell, a Maine Democrat who then headed a subcommittee on environmental protection, would have effectively required such scrubbers on about 55 older coal plants by 1995. The installation costs would have been subsidized with a tax on electricity produced in all high-sulfur plants. Regional Allowances</p>
        <p>A cheaper, market-based alternative, argues Dan Dudek, an economist for the Environmental Defense Fund, would be to set the maximum tonnage of sulfur emissions permitted from an entire region - the 31 states east of the Great Plains, for example.</p>
        <p>Utilities would then be issued permits to pollute, with emissions linked to past rates of discharge. A big utility in the Midwest with aging plants that have always burned high-sulfur coal might end up with rights to dump a half-million tons of sulfur a year, while a small-town electricity co-op operating an emissions-free hydropower power plant would receive none at all.</p>
        <p>The limit in total emissions, and each utility's share of the tonnage, would be ratcheted down over time, with a goal of, say, cutting sulfur output in half within 15 years.</p>
        <p>According to studies by ICF Inc., a respected environmental consultant in Virginia, scrubbers would remain the cheapest way for some utilities to stay within emissions limits; the tighter the constraint on total tonnage, the larger the number of plants likely to need scrubbers. But others, Mr. Dudek believes, would adopt alternative strategies.</p>
        <p>They might switch to low-sulfur coal or try new technologies that remove sulfur without scrubbers. Or they might limit the use of their most polluting plants to periods of peak electricity demand. Yet another strategy would be to retire older plants, replacing them with natural-gas fired units or offering subsidies to customers to invest in high-efficiency appliances and lighting fixtures. Buying and Selling Permits</p>
        <p>But some utilities, particularly those in areas of rapidly growing demand for electricity, would probably find it cheaper to buy pollution permits than reduce emissions. Indeed, some might use the market for permits the way wheat dealers now use the grain markets in Chicago, buying and selling permits according to price and seasonal needs.</p>
        <p>Such flexibility, Mr. Dudek says, would generate more anti-pollution bang for a buck. And a study by ICF that was just released by the Environmental Protection Agency comes to the same conclusion.</p>
        <p>Cutting nine million tons of sulfur (roughly half the amount now emitted each year) by tightening controls on every smokestack would add $2.3 billion annually to utility costs by the year 2000, the study says. Meeting the same goal by allowing unrestricted trading in pollution permits would cost just $1.5 billion, the agency found.</p>
        <p>These numbers may be new, but the basic ideas have been around for years. Since 1978, the E.P.A. has allowed cities that could not meet air quality standards to create emissions trading systems, in which new businesses buy pollution rights from existing ones. But the approach has been used very sparingly and has never caught on with local environmental adminstrators.</p>
        <p>According to Paul Portney, a researcher at Resources for the Future in Washington, the idea of exchanging the right to pollute for money has never appealed to those in the vanguard of the environmental movement. ''They viewed pollution as morally wrong,'' he says, something to be excised, not accommodated. Political Climate Changes</p>
        <p>Why have the prospects for a market-based approach improved? One reason is a changing political climate. Ronald Reagan opposed any regulation of acid rain. President Bush says he is committed to such legislation, and as early as last December declared himself in favor of market-based solutions to environmental problems wherever they were practical.</p>
        <p>Senator Robert C. Byrd, the former Majority Leader from West Virgina, a major coal-mining state, insisted that any legislation protect high-sulfur coal mines and miners. His successor, Senator Mitchell, is known as a friend of organized labor. But his past support for scrubbers was pragmatic, not ideological.</p>
        <p>An equally important factor is the rise of a new generation of environmentalists who are more cost-conscious and less suspicious of business.</p>
        <p>The free-market enthusiasts at the Environmental Defense Fund, based on the West Coast, may not dominate the Clean Air Coalition, the collective voice of environmental groups on air pollution matters, But they do serve as a counterweight to the Coalition's traditionalists at the Natural Resources Defense Fund.</p>
        <p>David Hawkins, an E.P.A. official in the Carter Administration and the Defense Fund's spokesman on acid rain, will not commit himself to support legislation for a market-based system. However, if a bill were introduced by the Bush Administration that promised substantial reductions in sulfur emissions by any reliable means, the Defense Fund would not likely oppose it. To do so would risk a split in the coalition and dim the chances of any acid rain legislation this year.</p>
        <p>Similar realignments are emerging in Congress. Senator Tim Wirth, a Democrat from Colorado with a long record of supporting tough environmental regulations, has lent his name, as co-chairman with Senator John Heinz, Republican of Pennsylvania, to ''Project 88,'' a report encouraging market-oriented solutions to a dozen environmental problems. ''If a market-based solution is the way to get a cost-effective, technologically neutral acid rain bill, I'm for it,'' he said in an interview. Opposition Remains</p>
        <p>Supporters of a market-based solution to acid rain must still overcome opposition from organized labor, Eastern coal-state Democrats, coal-burning utilities and conservatives who insist that reducing sulfur emissions is not worth the price.</p>
        <p>But paradoxically, the most telling opposition to such a bill may come from within the Bush Administration. Some of the President's political strategists favor market-based acid rain legislation, but they want a legislative victory for George Bush even more. If it appears that an alliance with high-sulfur coal interests behind a bill requiring scrubbers would assure a quick triumph, they might make a deal.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Dudek and many other economists, who are looking ahead to critical global debates on how to contain the threats posed by pollution-related atmospheric warming and destruction of the ozone layer, that would be a hard compromise to bear.</p>
        <p>Acid rain legislation, he says, ''is the last best opportunity to demonstrate the power of market-based methods in solving environmental problems.''</p>
