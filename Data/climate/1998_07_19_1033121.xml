        <p>Re: the continuing debate over Lilco, Shoreham and the LIPA deal -- it's O.K. to argue that crimes were committed, but to do so without any specifies while tossing around generalities like ''massive crimes'' doesn't help.</p>
        <p>The decision to build Shoreham fit in very well with the tenor of the times and the worldwide effort to provide needed energy by means other than fossil fuels, which is a finite source. Nuclear energy has been proven safe all over the world, with the exception, of course, in the Soviet Union. They were trying to impress the world and gave no heed to safety in their planning.</p>

        <p>The decision to build Shoreham fit in very well with the tenor of the times and the worldwide effort to provide needed energy by means other than fossil fuels, which is a finite source. Nuclear energy has been proven safe all over the world, with the exception, of course, in the Soviet Union. They were trying to impress the world and gave no heed to safety in their planning.</p>
        <p>Over the years decisions about Shoreham were made by many people, government personnel, company employees, politicians of all stripes, all in response to varied desires and constituents. But to continue to call names, impugn people's integrity and make claims without proof or legitimate discussion does no one any good. If the authorities wish to prosecute people who were decision-makers, then they may do so. That's the way this country works. But discontinue the unsubstantiated and vitriolic rhetoric.</p>
