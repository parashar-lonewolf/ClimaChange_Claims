        <p>Gen. Wesley K. Clark loves to talk on the campaign trail about a new electric motor and rechargeable battery that he says could be used in electric cars and windmills to reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil. If he is elected president, General Clark promises, he will put ''big bucks'' into subsidies for the development of those and other types of renewable energy.</p>
        <p>One thing General Clark does not mention is that he has a financial interest in the small private company that developed and is marketing the new motor and battery.</p>
        <p>Financial disclosure forms released late last week show that General Clark owns options to buy a percentage of the company, WaveCrest Laboratories, based in Dulles, Va. General Clark has worked for the company as a consultant and served as chairman of its board.</p>
        <p>The disclosure form, which must be filed by all presidential candidates, says the options are currently worth little or nothing, accounting for an immeasurably small portion of General Clark's net worth of approximately $3 million. Called membership options, they are similar to publicly traded stock options in that they give General Clark the right to buy a small percentage of the company at a certain price. Because WaveCrest is a private entity however, the options cannot be traded.</p>
        <p>WaveCrest officials and the Clark campaign declined to disclose the options' terms or expiration date. If the company were to attract new financing, sell stock to the public or be acquired, the options' value could increase. At present, the company has no plans to go public.</p>
        <p>An aide to General Clark dismissed the suggestion that he could benefit. ''General Clark has made clear that when he becomes president he will take the appropriate steps to make sure his financial interests present no potential issues,'' said Chris Lehane, a strategist for the campaign, because those holding would be divested or placed in a blind trust.</p>
        <p>Tom McMahon, the director of communications and government affairs at WaveCrest, said in an interview that the company's initial sales to the Pentagon, of an electric bicycle that uses the company's motor and battery technology, occurred after General Clark began working for WaveCrest as a consultant. But, he said that General Clark did not directly market the product to military officials but rather helped to guide the company's overall marketing strategy.</p>
        <p>In the last two years General Clark has received more than $195,000 in consulting and director fees from WaveCrest, and he served as chairman of its board from April 1 through Oct. 7, when he resigned to focus on his campaign for the Democratic nomination for president. The company is seeking additional financing to further develop its motor and battery systems. Even if General Clark doesn't win the nomination or the presidency, WaveCrest might benefit from his consistent promotion of its technology.</p>
        <p>WaveCrest describes its ''adaptive motor system'' as an energy-efficient motor that does not require gears or transmission but instead relies on computer algorithms to maximize torque. Its efficiency and the company's special battery let it run longer on the same charge, said Boris Maslov, a co-founder of WaveCrest. The company is now working on a system whereby the motor would draw power from the battery while a driver is accelerating and then recharge the battery when the driver applies the brakes or coasts. And Mr. Maslov said wind-powered applications are being studied as well.</p>
        <p>General Clark has discussed the WaveCrest technology several times over the last month, most recently at a campaign event on Thursday in this town in western New Hampshire, where he enthused about a future where the use of electric cars employing the WaveCrest technology could cut oil imports in half.</p>
        <p>At a campaign event on Dec. 9 in New Castle, N.H., when a student asked about wind and other renewable resources, General Clark responded: ''I like wind-generated power. I was in a company, and we had this really great electric motor technology.'' After giving a basic description of the motor, he added, ''If you hook this new kind of motor up the right way to a small, not big, a very small windmill, you can generate very good electricity.''</p>
        <p>On Dec. 8 in Contoocook, N.H., he said: ''We are going to put the big bucks and the incentives into alternative energy. The form of alternative energy that I think offers the greatest promise for America frankly is wind-generated energy,'' and he went on to describe the adaptation of the WaveCrest motor for wind power.</p>
        <p>General Clark again raised about the WaveCrest technology in a meeting with the editorial board of The New York Times on Dec. 11. ''This little company I was the chairman of came up with two very interesting technologies that are worth just a minute here,'' he said. One, an electric motor, ''fits in wheels, and if you have small powerful motors that are controlled by electronics that fit in wheels you will see the end of the internal combustion engine. It's just inevitable. And when you do that and couple it with the battery technology that they've come up with, which is a sort of instant recharge battery,'' what will result is widespread electric transportation.</p>
        <p>For all of General Clark's enthusiasm, Mr. Lehane laughed at the prospect that he would profit from the venture.</p>
        <p>''The chances are greater that Wes Clark will get hit by a meteorite than that he will benefit in any way, shape or form from his minuscule financial interest in a company that sells electric bikes,'' he said.</p>
