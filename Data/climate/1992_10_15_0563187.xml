        <p>Moving carefully from his roots in the Bronx up the fragile rungs of New York power, Bob Abrams has tended to face daunting odds and fierce enemies with a certain equanimity.</p>
        <p>Perhaps because he usually wins.</p>
        <p>In 12 races in a 26-year career in public office, Mr. Abrams has lost only once. The blow came in 1974, when he made his first bid to replace Louis J.

He has been winning ever since.</p>

        <p>Moving carefully from his roots in the Bronx up the fragile rungs of New York power, Bob Abrams has tended to face daunting odds and fierce enemies with a certain equanimity.</p>
        <p>Perhaps because he usually wins.</p>
        <p>In 12 races in a 26-year career in public office, Mr. Abrams has lost only once. The blow came in 1974, when he made his first bid to replace Louis J. Lefkowitz, an institution as Attorney General. In that election, Mr. Abrams ran a close second. Four years later, when Mr. Lefkowitz did not seek re-election, Mr. Abrams won. He has been winning ever since.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Abrams is facing what may be the bitterest fight of his political career, simultaneously having to combat charges against his integrity and lingering unease within his own party after an unusually vicious -- and close -- Democratic primary for the United States Senate.</p>
        <p>Running close in the polls but far behind at the bank, the Attorney General is pitching the $750,000 he had set aside for his general campaign against the $4 million Alfonse M. D'Amato had as the general-election campaign began. He has been buffeted by volley after volley of accusations, as Mr. D'Amato, the 12-year Republican incumbent Senator, has tried to wear away the Attorney General's reputation as an effective, if bland, public servant who has spent two largely scandal-free decades in New York politics.</p>
        <p>Yet in the midst of this strange season of political unrest, Mr. Abrams's biggest problems may be at home base. After a brutal primary race that gained him a sliver-thin victory over Geraldine A. Ferraro, he has found himself having to caravan around the state, convincing party members and even some longtime supporters that he did not stoop to conquer. Many Democrats say they were disturbed by the vitriolic tone and exchanges of the primary. And though they mostly blame Elizabeth Holtzman, the New York City Comptroller, for initiating a bitter series of assaults against Ms. Ferraro, they blame Mr. Abrams, too, for taking advantage of that assault and sometimes joining in.</p>
        <p>The controversy and distaste has marked an unusual moment in a career that has otherwise been outstanding mostly for its lack of drama. In fact, most of Mr. Abrams's career has been anything but controversial. Toiling first in the State Assembly (at the age of 27), then as the powerful Bronx Borough President and finally, for the past 13 years as the State Attorney General best known for his battles in such areas as the environment, civil rights and consumer protection, he has built a name for consistency and built his strongest support among New York liberals.</p>
        <p>In this age of extravagant personalities and pugilistic politics, Robert Abrams is an unlikely player. If he were a vegetable, he would be a humble pea in a world of radicchio. Bland in victory and distinctly uncharismatic on the stump, he is not the sort of politician people run to, just to touch that magic. Instead, he is Mr. No Charisma. Boring Bob.</p>
        <p>"Yeah, that's what they say," said James E. Tierney, a former Attorney General of Maine who joined Mr. Abrams in several legal actions. "We live in a world where if a guy gets up in the morning and goes to work he's dull, no flash. Except this isn't theater. This is government," said Mr. Tierney, who is now a fellow at Harvard and consultant to eight attorneys general around the country. "You could argue that we've already had enough actors."</p>
        <p>Mr. Abrams has been New York's Attorney General for 13 years, but few people know what he does. "Something to do with the law, right?" ventured a middle-aged man walking near Central Park one recent afternoon.</p>
        <p>Not even the New York bureaucracy is entirely clear on this point. The worst fight Mr. Abrams ever had with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo came early in his career as Attorney General. Piqued over a legal controversy, Mr. Cuomo said he remembers calling Mr. Abrams and asking him for support. "Are you the Governor's lawyer or aren't you?" he remembers asking Mr. Abrams, though he no longer remembers the details of the case.</p>
        <p>The Attorney General, said Mr. Cuomo, responded that he was "the people's lawyer." The Governor remembers it as a "grating experience" that was eventually resolved to both men's satisfaction.</p>
        <p>Politicians say there are tensions between the two men to this day. But Mr. Cuomo dismissed reports of a rift. "I respect him," the Governor said of Mr. Abrams. "I like him, and I like what he stands for."</p>
        <p>Later, the Governor would give Mr. Abrams his toughest case, asking him to investigate the charges of Tawana Brawley that she was abducted and sexually assaulted by at least six white men. The case was so loaded with racial trip wires and political sand traps that many believed he was sure to fail. Instead, Mr. Abrams survived relatively unscathed when Ms. Brawley's charges were discredited, though a lingering resentment remained among many blacks. Changing the Role Of Attorney General</p>
        <p>Although in the Tawana Brawley case the Attorney General's involvement in a criminal matter was the result of orders from the Governor's mansion, the gradual movement of Mr. Abrams's office into more and more criminal work has been criticized by some as a cynical attempt to push himself into the spotlight. Criminal cases tend to get more publicity than civil ones do.</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Abrams has changed the role of the Attorney General's office in several ways. Mr. Tierney, who as Maine Attorney General came to know Mr. Abrams when they cooperated in several cases involving antitrust law and acid rain, sees Mr. Abrams's expansion of his duties as the work of an activist trying to take maximum advantage of a vaguely defined role. Having studied the offices of attornies general around the country, Mr. Tierney said Mr. Abrams's office has been at the cutting edge of work involving such topics as consumer protection, antitrust law and the environment. "The modern office of the Attorney General was created by Bob Abrams," he said. "He took over an office that was really in the dark ages. He developed a management structure and depoliticized the office."</p>
        <p>That view, of course, does not square with Senator D'Amato's. In recent weeks the Senator has repeatedly charged Mr. Abrams with abusing his office in his political fund-raising efforts, citing the report of the State Commission on Government Integrity appointed by Mr. Cuomo and headed by John D. Feerick. That report, after addressing risks inherent in the structure of the office, concluded that Mr. Abrams's fund-raising efforts had sometimes entailed "appearances of conflicts of interest," which were "similar to those we have noted in our analysis of the other statewide elected officials."</p>
        <p>The report, which constitutes one of the few broadsides against the candidate in his career, dwells at length on Mr. Abrams's dealings with Donald J. Trump and another real-estate developer, Arthur Cohen, as part of the Attorney General's review of plans for co-operative and condominium apartments. The report concludes that "inherent in a policy that permits solicitation of campaign contributions while a plan is pending" is the implication "that payment will be expected for favorable action by the office holder." The report concluded that the practice was "implicitly coercive."</p>
        <p>Mr. Abrams's defenders counter that the report dwelled more on institutional failures than personal ones.  "It's an outrage that Al D'Amato, who the Feerick Commission could not investigate because he was a Federal official, is using that report," said Peter Bienstock, a former Abrams staff member who left in 1987 to be executive director of the Feerick Commission. "The report is pretty clear that the criticisms are really a function of the system and not the person."</p>
        <p>Mr. Bienstock, who excused himself from the investigation into the Attorney General's office because of his former connection with it, said he believes Mr. Abrams did all that he could to take politics out of the office. A Primary Cause Of Harsh Criticism</p>
        <p>Some of the harshest critiques of Mr. Abrams have not been about his ethics, but about his judgment during the primary campaign.</p>
        <p>It was his behavior in the primary that hurt him most obviously. Ms. Ferraro is clearly still angered by his attacks and has declined to offer what in most cases would be a rather automatic endorsement.</p>
        <p>Some Italian-Americans have expressed distress over the Attorney General's part in attacks on Ms. Ferraro, which they suggest amounted to ethnic slurs. Others simply say they resent the tone of the primary and lost respect for Mr. Abrams in the process. And some women complain that Mr. Abrams spoiled an opportunity for New York to send a woman to the Senate.</p>
        <p>It is a strange moment for a man who has consistently worked on matters of gender and ethnicity. Mr. Abrams has long been a supporter of abortion rights, one issue key to many women voters, and has worked throughout his tenure as Attorney General to fight prejudice at all levels.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bienstock remembers one case in particular in which the Attorney General's office moved to sue a neighborhood group for trying to prevent the establishment of a home for retarded children in the area. "Bob never blinked," he recalled. "And we prevailed in that case."</p>
        <p>Criticism from women has particularly hurt the candidate politically, because he spent much of the primary depicting himself as a "better feminist" than Ms. Ferraro, more consistent on abortion rights, health care, family leave and other issues considered central to women's lives. In recent days, Mr. Abrams has intentionally courted women's votes and underscored his record on those issues.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abrams has assembled a staff that busily gets his message out. When Operation Rescue, an anti-abortion group, came to New York City during the Democratic National Convention, the Attorney General's office sent newspapers background material about a temporary restraining order obtained by that office to prevent the group from shutting down clinics. Lawyers with the NOW Legal Defense Fund later sputtered that Mr. Abrams's approach was modeled upon their own, started earlier, and said the action was little more than a legal redundancy. Mr. Abrams maintains that each effort served a separate purpose. Law and Politics Were Early Interests</p>
        <p>There was, perhaps, a certain inevitability to Mr. Abrams's decision to become a lawyer. As he was growing up in Pelham Parkway, the Bronx, his father often warned him not to follow in his footsteps, running a small luncheonette and working from 4 a.m. until nearly midnight. "He used to always tell me, 'Be like your Uncle Henry. Go join your Uncle Henry's law firm,' " Mr. Abrams recalled. He did precisely that.</p>
        <p>The attraction to politics came early, too. On Sundays, when his father's diner was closed, the family would gather and talk about the way the world was run. One uncle was a union official. His grandfather was an organizer in a sewing-machine factory on the Lower East Side. So Mr. Abrams was intrigued when a reformist group within the Democratic Party encouraged him to become involved in New York politics while he was still a student at the New York University Law School.</p>
        <p>After that, he backed into his real career, he says now. Drafted first as president of his political club, he was then drafted to run for the State Assembly. "I was always underfunded," he said. "I was always running against someone with a lot of money."</p>
        <p>It is the same this year. Outspent "five to one," as he repeats at nearly every stop, the Attorney General is fighting the same difficult odds, but as a veteran.</p>
