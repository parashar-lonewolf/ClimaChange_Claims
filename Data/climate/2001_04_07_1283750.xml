        <p>After deriding for months the pledges of Ford Motor and General Motors to improve the fuel economy of sport utility vehicles and other light trucks by close to 25 percent, DaimlerChrysler A.G. has reversed itself and now says its light trucks will meet or exceed its rivals' models in average gas mileage.</p>
        <p>DaimlerChrysler last year sold 1.9 million light trucks, a category that encompasses pickup trucks like the Dodge Ram and minivans like the Dodge Caravan, as well as sport utility vehicles like Jeeps and the Dodge Durango. G.M. sold 2.4 million light trucks and Ford sold 2.5 million. So the three manufacturers have now pledged to increase the gas mileage of nearly seven million vehicles a year, or two-fifths of the American market.</p>

        <p>After deriding for months the pledges of Ford Motor and General Motors to improve the fuel economy of sport utility vehicles and other light trucks by close to 25 percent, DaimlerChrysler A.G. has reversed itself and now says its light trucks will meet or exceed its rivals' models in average gas mileage.</p>
        <p>DaimlerChrysler last year sold 1.9 million light trucks, a category that encompasses pickup trucks like the Dodge Ram and minivans like the Dodge Caravan, as well as sport utility vehicles like Jeeps and the Dodge Durango. G.M. sold 2.4 million light trucks and Ford sold 2.5 million. So the three manufacturers have now pledged to increase the gas mileage of nearly seven million vehicles a year, or two-fifths of the American market.</p>
        <p>Those improvements would be the first significant change in the fuel economy of any class of passenger vehicle in almost two decades.</p>
        <p>''We are committed to improving the fuel efficiency of all our vehicles,'' JÃ¼rgen Schrempp, chairman of DaimlerChrysler, said in a statement this afternoon. ''Our fleet will match or exceed those of other full-line manufacturers.''</p>
        <p>He set no timetable for carrying out the standards.</p>
        <p>Federal regulations require that each automaker sell cars that get an average of at least 27.5 miles per gallon. But the minimum average required for light trucks is 20.7 miles per gallon, and DaimlerChrysler, Ford and G.M. barely meet that standard. As sport utilities have soared in popularity, the average fuel economy of new vehicles has fallen steadily.</p>
        <p>This has alarmed environmentalists, because the burning of gasoline by automobiles is the second-largest source of manmade emissions of carbon dioxide, a gas linked to global warming. Last month, President Bush reversed a campaign pledge to regulate carbon dioxide emissions of power plants, which are the biggest source of such emissions in the nation.</p>
        <p>The decline in fuel economy has also worried people concerned about rising gasoline prices and about the world's dependence on oil from politically volatile areas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schrempp made a point, however, of saying in his statement that DaimlerChrysler would match or exceed what other automakers actually did, not what they promised. ''Our yardstick is not what is announced, but is delivered,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Because G.M. also pledged to beat only Ford, this means that everything depends on Ford's ability to carry out the commitments it made last summer. Jason Vines, a Ford spokesman, said Ford would meet its commitment. He noted that Ford had pledged in January 1998 to reduce sharply the air pollution from its sport utility vehicles by the end of that year, and had done so.</p>
        <p>In a speech in Washington last July 27, Jacques Nasser, Ford's chief executive, promised to improve the average fuel economy of Ford sport utilities by 25 percent over the next five years. That would amount to nearly five miles a gallon.</p>
        <p>Ford executives also said then that they planned to commit themselves this year to a similarly large increase in the fuel efficiency of minivans and pickup trucks, but have not yet done so. Mr. Vines said Ford was still calculating the precise improvement that was technologically feasible.</p>
        <p>Harry Pearce, G.M.'s vice chairman, responded to Mr. Nasser in a speech on Aug. 2, vowing that no matter how much Ford improved the average fuel economy of its sport utilities over the next five years, G.M. would make sure it had an even higher average fuel efficiency. Mr. Pearce then one-upped Mr. Nasser, saying the average fuel efficiency of all G.M. light trucks would be higher than Ford's average as well.</p>
        <p>Max Gates, a DaimlerChrysler spokesman, said Mr. Schrempp's statement referred to matching or exceeding Ford and G.M. in overall gas mileage for cars and for light trucks. DaimlerChrysler is not committing itself to fuel-economy goals in specific market segments like sport utilities, he added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schrempp's statement came after limited consultation with the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler, where executives were surprised and dismayed when told of it. ''It's going to be news to a lot of people who are toiling in the fields on our fuel economy and on our future products,'' said an executive who insisted on anonymity. ''I really don't think that's something the company has to do to sell cars.''</p>
        <p>Much more than Ford and G.M., Chrysler has a long history of resisting pressure to improve fuel economy, tailpipe emissions and safety. Chrysler executives were bitter last summer about Ford's announcement, privately accusing Ford of having undermined the industry's opposition to tighter federal fuel-economy standards for sport utilities and other light trucks.</p>
        <p>DaimlerChrysler had said after the G.M. announcement on Aug. 2 that it was not willing to make a similar commitment. ''We'll let them do the tit for tat,'' Michael Aberlich, a DaimlerChrysler spokesman, said then.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gates said that today's statement had been prepared because of a visit Mr. Schrempp had made to The New York Times on Tuesday. ''Schrempp's statement was made in response to questions asked by editors of The New York Times,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Christoph Walther Sr., DaimlerChrysler's vice president for communications and its top spokesman, said automakers in Europe had made voluntary commitments to much higher gas mileage there out of a sense of social responsibility, so the company saw a need to make commitments in the United States as well.</p>
        <p>The American executives of Chrysler have been the staunchest opponents of tighter regulations on light trucks because 74 percent of Chrysler's sales are light trucks now. Chrysler's light trucks currently get slightly better gas mileage on average than Ford's or G.M.'s, because Chrysler does not sell any sport utilities as big as the Ford Excursion or GMC Suburban.</p>
        <p>Federal fuel-economy standards have been frozen for the last six years by Republicans in Congress. Upset by high gasoline prices, Democratic and Republican senators from Western states allied themselves with environmentalists last summer in an attempt to let the Clinton administration raise the standards. In a compromise last summer, Congress ordered the creation of a committee of the National Academy of Sciences to assess American fuel-economy policy and deliver a report by this July 1.</p>
        <p>Foreign automakers have refused to commit themselves to any voluntary improvements in fuel economy. The average gas mileage of cars and light trucks sold by Japanese automakers is currently higher than the average gas mileage of American automakers' vehicles. But the average gas mileage of the Japanese automakers, especially Toyota, is now falling as they sell more large models.</p>
