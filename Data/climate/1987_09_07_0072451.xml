        <p>LEAD: A foot-long crack that developed after the test firing of the space shuttle's redesigned booster rocket last week will prompt more rigorous inspection of rocket casings before they are re-used, the booster's manufacturer said yesterday.</p>
        <p>A foot-long crack that developed after the test firing of the space shuttle's redesigned booster rocket last week will prompt more rigorous inspection of rocket casings before they are re-used, the booster's manufacturer said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The crack developed several minutes after the Aug. 30 test firing was complete, when a water cooling system failed. The system was designed to keep the steel casings from overheating.</p>
        <p>The head of the booster redesign project for Morton Thiokol Inc., Allan J. McDonald, said in a telephone interview yesterday that the conditions that led to the crack were ''unique to this kind of test,'' and posed no danger during flights. Company officials said they did not expect the problem to cause additional delays in the tests scheduled as part of the effort to resume shuttle missions, which came to a halt with the Challenger explosion in January 1986.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the appearance of the crack underscored the fragility of the heavy steel cases that house 1.1 million pounds of solid propellant.</p>
        <p>It appeared to raise questions about the space agency's plan to continue re-using some of the rocket segments. The booster rockets are shed from the shuttle two minutes into flight and recovered from the ocean. After testing, the casings are ordinarly re-filled with propellent as an economy measure. If in Doubt, We Won't</p>
        <p>''We'll still be able to re-use undamaged segments,'' Mr. McDonald said. ''But it's possible that we will have to re-use fewer than we originally planned. Obviously, if there is any doubt about re-using a case, we won't do it.''</p>
        <p>During hearings held by the Presidential commission that investigated the Challenger accident last year, it was revealed that the casings swelled after each ignition, perhaps affecting their ability to fit together correctly. Some investigators believe such swelling could have contributed to the accident, which killed seven astronauts.</p>
        <p>According to the account provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Mr. McDonald, the crack developed after a kink in a fire hose kept the cooling system from spraying water on the casing toward the rear of the rocket, which burned for two minutes at Thiokol's test facilities in northeastern Utah.</p>
        <p>In actual flights, no such water system is necessary because the booster segments are cooled as they fall back to earth and then hit the ocean off Cape Canaveral. But in test firings, the rocket is lashed down horizontally. As a result, hundreds of pounds of unburned ''slag,'' the superheated remnants of the fuel, collect in the aft end of the booster at the end fo the test. Super Heat, Then Super Cold</p>
        <p>The slag sits on the bottom of the rocket and slowly burns through the insulation that ordinarily protects the casings from the heat.</p>
        <p>''The slag heated the case to about 1,000 degrees,'' said Mr. McDonald. Firefighters who raced up the mountainside after the test aimed water on the cases, ''but by that time it was too late. You could already see the hot spots.''</p>
        <p>Some time later, super-chilled carbon dioxide, which had been shot inside the rocket casings to extinguish any remaining burning fuel, chilled the same spot on the case to sub-freezing temperature. That shrank the case, and the foot-long crack appeared along the circumference of the casing, about a tenth of an inch across, Mr. McDonald said.</p>
        <p>The crack developed on only one of the five-foot sections that form the rear segment of the rocket. An adjoining section was deformed, and will also have to be discarded. Other sections are still being tested to determine if they were also damaged.</p>
        <p>Thiokol officials said they did not expect that the failure of the water cooling system, which is being redesigned to use only rigid pipe instead of fire hoses, would delay the second test of the booster in November.</p>
        <p>So far, only one segment of the test-fired rocket has been removed and inspected for erosion of its safety seals, the chief cause of the Challenger disaster. ''That segment looked fine,'' said Mr. McDonald. An additional segment would be removed today, he said.</p>
