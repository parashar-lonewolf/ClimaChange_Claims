        <p>Four years ago, a company that owns two local power plants settled a lawsuit with New York State by agreeing to install $100 million worth of pollution control technology at one of them, its coal-fired plant here, or shut it down.</p>
        <p>At the time, the company, Mirant New York, said it would move forward with the upgrades at its Lovett plant. But on Thursday, state officials announced a different outcome. In a news conference here, Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo said the state was forcing the plant to close after Mirant failed to reduce emissions with new technology.</p>
        <p>One unit of the plant closed on Monday, while the other will close in one year, as stipulated by a 2003 consent decree.</p>
        <p>The emissions from the 350-megawatt Lovett plant are linked to acid rain and smog. At the time of the settlement, state environmental officials said the emissions from Lovett alone, which looms over the west bank of the Hudson River, represented a quarter of the sulfur dioxide and almost a third of the nitrogen oxide released by electric generators in seven counties in the Hudson Valley.</p>
        <p>The state also announced on Thursday that it had won a concession from Mirant, the area's largest taxpayer, that should assuage residents of this town as well as the neighboring town of Haverstraw, where the company has its Bowline plant, an oil-powered generating station.</p>
        <p>Area residents are reeling from a settlement last year with Mirant in which Rockland County and several taxing entities agreed to pay the company $275 million to make up for tax overcharges dating back more than a decade.</p>
        <p>The settlement has led to an increase in local taxes for several municipalities. To meet the terms of the settlement, the North Rockland school district, which is now on an austerity budget, recently issued a 30-year bond to raise $220 million for a tax refund.</p>
        <p>State officials, realizing that the closing of Lovett could result in new tax headaches for the area, won a commitment from Mirant not to challenge its tax assessment for the Bowline plant for the next two years. The company also pledged $1 million for energy conservation projects in northern Rockland County.</p>
        <p>''This is a win for the environment and also a win for the taxpayers,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''We're going to reduce pollution, and with this agreement we're also going to protect the taxpayers of Stony Point and Haverstraw.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mirant New York, Louis F. Friscoe, said in a phone interview that the company had decided not to upgrade the Lovett plant. ''Because of the vintage of the facility and the cost of the new technology, we just thought the economics weren't there,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But the Atlanta-based Mirant Corporation, which owns two dozen plants nationwide and recently emerged from bankruptcy, is exploring the possibility of building new natural-gas-fired plants on the sites of Lovett and Bowline, Mr. Friscoe said. Natural gas burns cleaner than coal or oil.</p>
        <p>In a statement, Mirant's chairman and chief executive officer, Edward R. Muller, cited state estimates that the Hudson Valley would need increased electrical generation by 2011. He said that Mirant would ''work with the state to insure that the new generation is built there to serve New York consumers.''</p>
