        <p>Laurie David is organizing a star-studded, cause-oriented television special this week, but here's something refreshing: She doesn't want your cash or credit-card number.</p>
        <p>''We're raising awareness, not money,'' said Ms. David, the creator of ''Earth to America!,'' a two-hour special on TBS that aspires to highlight the issue of global warming by making people laugh themselves silly. Ms. David has recruited a formidable roster of comics and other stars -- Ray Romano, Robin Williams, Wanda Sykes, Martin Short, Steve Martin, Stephen Colbert, Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Tom Hanks, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and at least a dozen more -- but instead of ''please call the number you see on your screen and make a donation,'' they will be asking people to go to www.stopglobalwarming.org. That is where, at no cost, people can join what organizers call a ''virtual march on Washington,'' expressing their concern electronically about global warming.</p>
        <p>The issue, of course, has not exactly been underexposed, but Ms. David said her special is not just about trumpeting the term; it's about conveying ''what you can do about it, and what you can demand gets done about it.'' The virtual march, she said, is intended to show that people no longer view the issue as an academic debate, that ''Americans know the globe is warming, we're causing it, and we want solutions to it.''</p>
        <p>The message may be serious, but the show, Ms. David promised, will not be. ''First and foremost, the goal is to entertain,'' she said. ''The second goal is to put across a little information and give the issue some prominence.''</p>
        <p>Getting such a starry lineup, she said, did involve calling in quite a few markers, with the help of her husband, Larry David, of the offbeat HBO show ''Curb Your Enthusiasm.'' (Viewers, she said, will get a rare chance to see Mr. David do something resembling standup.) But ''everyone was eager to do it,'' she said, since comics are attuned to the news and well aware of environmental issues.</p>
        <p>The show is being taped three days before the broadcast at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas and will mix standup, sketch comedy, film and other forms. ''To some extent it's like a variety show,'' said Ms. David, who added that it was something of a surprise that there was a national channel brave enough to offer a show on such a charged topic. What does she hope viewers will think afterward? ''That was different and fun and about something,'' she said.</p>
