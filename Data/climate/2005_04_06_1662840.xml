        <p>Peter Jennings Announces That He Has Lung Cancer  Peter Jennings, the anchor of ABC's evening newscast for the last 22 years, announced that he was suffering from lung cancer and had begun treatment.</p>
        <p>ABC said Mr. Jennings, who is 66, will work as often as he can during his course of treatment.

[Page A20.]</p>
        <p>Allied Domecq in Talks to Be Bought  Allied Domecq of Britain said that it was in talks with Pernod Ricard of France and Fortune Brands of the United States about a buyout, a move that would revamp the alcoholic beverage industry. An offer for Allied Domecq could be worth more than $13 billion, executives involved in the talks said. [C12.]</p>
        <p>MCI to Stick With Verizon Deal  The board of MCI Inc. said last night that it was sticking by its merger agreement with Verizon Communications and rejecting a higher takeover bid from rival Qwest Communications. [C10.]</p>
        <p>Morgan Stanley Change Urged  Eight retired dissident executives of Morgan Stanley proposed that one of their own, Robert G. Scott, immediately replace Philip J. Purcell as chief executive. [C7.]</p>
        <p>Mortgage Regulator Resigns  Armando Falcon Jr., the top regulator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, announced that he would step down. [C5.]</p>
        <p>Interpublic Again Delays Results  Executives of the Interpublic Group of Companies said for the third time in almost a month that they could not yet determine when they would be able to release 2004 financial results. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [C6.]</p>
        <p>Auto Emission Cuts in Canada  Automakers agreed to reduce greenhouse gases under a voluntary agreement with the Canadian government. [C5.]</p>
        <p>Wal-Mart Chief Responds to Critics  H. Lee Scott Jr., Wal-Mart's chief executive, took the offensive against critics who have sought to block new stores in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, saying that the company is good for consumers and good for its 1.3 million American employees. He noted that when Wal-Mart opens a store, more than 3,000 people often apply for 300 jobs. [C11.]</p>
        <p>Major Stock Indicators Show Gains  Stocks gained as oil prices retreated. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 37.32 points, to close at 10,458.46. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index was up 5.27 points, to end at 1,181.39. The Nasdaq composite index rose 8.25 points, to 1,999.32. [C12.]</p>
