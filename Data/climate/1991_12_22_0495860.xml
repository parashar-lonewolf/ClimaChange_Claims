        <p>THE CITIZENS HUMANE COMMISSION OF BERKELEY, CALIF., a city that can always be counted upon to encapsulate America's loss of knowledge about the real world, not long ago conducted a spirited debate over exempting miniature pet pigs from an ordinance banning farm animals within the city limits. The issue, a spokesman told The Wall Street Journal, was not whether the pigs posed a threat to hygiene, or whether they would create a nuisance to neighbors, but "whether it is humane to impose domesticity on yet another animal." One commissioner argued that domestication of any animal "deprives that animal of living its own life," and vowed to fight the commission's mildly pro-pig recommendation.</p>
        <p>Even those who don't equate the domestication of animals with their enslavement, as today's increasingly strident animal rights activists would have it, readily accept the idea that domestication of animals was something "imposed" by man, just as we imposed our will in countless other ways on the world around us. A not too far-fetched distillation of this view was in one of Mel Brooks's 2,000- Year-Old Man routines: it was a cave man named Bernie who "discovered" the woman, the 2,000-Year-Old Man recalls. "I think there's ladies here," Bernie announces one morning. It is a central myth of our culture that we are the authors of our destiny; the limitless power of human invention is something we simply take for granted.</p>
        <p>Casting domestication as a human act reinforces not only this heroic vision of human progress but also the modern, environmentalist world view that draws an uncrossable line between the natural and the artificial. This sentimental if perhaps understandable reaction to the excesses of the Industrial Revolution sees nature as a pristine world, perfect but for modern man, the klutz in heavy boots trampling the flowers. Domesticated animals are perforce artificial -- along with highways, nuclear power plants, clear-cut forests and all the other ugly ways human beings have devised to spoil nature.</p>
        <p>Yet archaeological evidence, animal-behavior studies and evolutionary theory have all begun to indicate that domestication was in fact an act of nature -- a remarkable and rather humbling explanation for the 10,000-year-old alliance between man and beast. The evidence suggests that it would have been impossible for humans willfully to domesticate animals in the way most people -- indeed, most scientists -- have long believed. Rather than a crime against nature, domestication was a product of nature, an evolutionary process driven by the animals' own need to adapt to the rapidly changing climatic conditions that swept the earth at the end of the ice age.</p>
        <p>Anthropologists, focusing on human intent as the determining factor, still often suggest that domestication grew out of the practice of pet-keeping, or arose in response to the pressures of an expanding human population or of environmental degradation. There are inherent contradictions, however, in supposing that domestication was an idea that just struck Bernie some fine Mesolithic morning: there are plenty of good reasons why no hunter-gatherer would have adopted a life of raising crops and tending stock by free choice. And there are fundamental biological obstacles that would have thwarted any primitive man determined to ignore good reason.</p>
        <p>The biological obstacles are manifest in the extraordinarily high failure rate of man the domesticator. American Indians, for example, kept moose, raccoons and bears as pets, but not one exists as a domesticated species today. The ancient Egyptians, whose very civilization was based on cattle herding and who were well versed in the mysteries of animal husbandry, tried but failed to domesticate gazelles, ibexes, hyenas and antelopes. Egyptian art depicts these and other animals with collars around their necks or being herded. Yet even for this highly developed agricultural civilization, such experiments proved to be failures. By contrast, several thousand years earlier, the very first agriculturists, people who had never built a fence or mowed a hayfield, had "succeeded" in domesticating virtually every animal that even today continues to occupy a place of importance in our homes and fields.</p>
        <p>Moreover, if we are to believe that domestication resulted from human exploits alone, we run into a biological paradox: the only way to produce an animal with the desirable traits is through captive breeding, yet the only way they could have been captively bred is if they had the desirable traits to start with. This paradox is the crux of the entire counterintuitive line of evidence that argues for domestication as an evolutionary, rather than human, invention. Those traits that would have made an animal amenable to domestication or profitable from a human standpoint -- docility, lack of fear, high reproductive rate -- were simply not present in the wild type that early man first encountered. It was not until the rigors of the ice age selected for those traits, which would prove so crucial to domestication, that the process could begin.</p>
        <p>In an evolutionary sense, the animals that we think of as domesticated chose us as much as we chose them. And that leads to a broader view of nature, which sees humans not as the arrogant despoilers and enslavers of the natural world, but as part of that natural world -- and the custodians of a remarkable evolutionary compact among the species.</p>
        <p>THE SEARCH FOR AN EXPLANATION THAT OVERCOMES THE inadequacy of purely cultural theories of domestication must begin with biology. Even if some primitive man or woman did set out into the woods and bring home a wolf pup, even if a thousand of them did, that act of human initiative could not have resulted in domestication; the biological differences between a wolf and a dog are too vast. Many people have raised raccoons, skunks and wolves in human households, but such tame animals are far from domesticated. They show a degree of aggressiveness and unpredictability that sets them well apart from the behavior of dogs and cats, and their behavior often becomes disruptive once they reach sexual maturity.</p>
        <p>Domesticated animals display many other characteristics, in particular a loss of defensive, fearful and territorial behaviors, that reflect basic biological changes -- not just training or taming. One anecdotal but nice example can be found in the tracks of dogs and cats in snow. The tracks of wild animals like wolves and foxes move in straight and purposeful lines; at the trot, each hind foot is cautiously placed exactly in the spot where the corresponding front foot first fell. Dog and cat tracks are a testimony to carefree fearlessness. They meander, circle, zigzag and drag; the hind feet sloppily miss the mark. The basic biological changes that underlie this loss of fearfulness have been well documented in that most studied of animals, the laboratory rat, which is a domesticated version of the Norway rat. The laboratory rat has been found to have undergone substantial changes in its major hormone-producing glands, including a reduction in size of the adrenal glands, associated with the hormones that trigger the "fight or flight" response.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, the consequences of domestication at times not only have nothing to do with human intention but in some cases actually work in opposition to it. Much of the mythology surrounding the domestication of the dog, for example, focuses on his utility as a guardian or hunter or herder. No one would deny that the dog has served man well. But even when the benefits are very broadly defined to include companionship, the success of dogs and cats in association with human society far outstrips the benefits to humans. The reproductive success of the United States' 118 million dogs and cats far outruns our generosity; witness the millions of unwanted cats and dogs in animal shelters. Even in parts of the world where cats and dogs are considered vermin and are the targets of occasional extermination campaigns, they continue to flourish. But their survival has nothing to do with being rewarded for their utility to man. It has to do, rather, with their superb adaptation to human society. In particular, the dogs' submissive behaviors -- cringing, looking away or rolling over -- are readily recognizable as such to humans, and generally succeed in deflecting human aggression.</p>
        <p>Even the domestication of food animals and the rise of animal husbandry, which conventional wisdom has always portrayed as a revolutionary advance for mankind, now appears to have been something less than that. A mounting body of archaeological evidence indicates that the shift from foraging and hunting to growing crops and tending herds was, as Jared M. Diamond, a physiologist at U.C.L.A., has written, "in many ways a catastrophe from which we have never recovered."</p>
        <p>Studies show that, at least initially, agriculture triggered an epidemic of injuries, malnutrition and infectious disease. The anthropologist George J. Armelagos, now at the University of Florida at Gainesville, studied the skeletons of Indians who lived in what is now Illinois from A.D. 950 to 1300; their adoption of intensive agriculture around A.D. 1200 was accompanied by a sudden increase, from 16 percent to 64 percent, in the incidence of iron-deficiency anemia and a sudden drop, from 26 years to 19 years, in average life expectancy. The explanation for this may be that the diet of hunter-gatherers was often nutritionally superior. The daily intake of calories and protein of one group of modern hunter-gatherers, the !Kung of the Kalahari Desert, is well above the recommended daily allowances, and the average time per week spent gathering food may be only 12 to 19 hours, according to one study. Agriculturalists, by contrast, may rely primarily on a single vegetable crop, as even such relatively recent catastrophes as the Irish potato famine illustrate, and their food supply is susceptible to drought and other environmental stresses. (Diamond goes on to blame agriculture not only for malnutrition and starvation, but also for epidemic diseases related to the rise of cities, and "another curse upon humanity: deep class divisions.")</p>
        <p>Direct evidence that the agricultural way of life was not an obvious improvement is buttressed indirectly by evidence that it was adopted slowly -- one might even say reluctantly -- rather than embraced in an enthusiastic "revolution." Hunting survived alongside agriculture and herding for thousands of years in the Middle East and Europe, just the opposite of what had long been thought.</p>
        <p>The implication of all this is that if we are to make sense of how and why domestication happened -- in spite of tremendous obstacles -- we need to stop looking at domestication as a human phenomenon and start seeing it also through the eyes of animals. The question is not what's in it for us, but what's in it for them.</p>
        <p>WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE DOG, WHOSE APPEARANCE AMONG the ranks of the domesticated preceded all other plants and animals by several thousand years, the first signs of domestication appear about 9,000 years ago, give or take a thousand years, in places as varied as the Middle East, Mesoamerica, Peru and the Far East. These first permanent agricultural settlements show evidence of domesticated cereal grains and, in the Middle East, domesticated sheep and goats.</p>
        <p>Something very unusual was happening, both geologically and biologically, at this time. It marked the end of the Pleistocene -- a tumultuous million years in the history of North America, Europe and Asia when glaciers repeatedly swept the continents and strange new animals came and went. As recently as 18,000 years ago, at the peak of the last major cycle of glacial advance, ice sheets covered about a third of the earth's present land area. What is now New York City lay beneath a mile of ice; glaciers reached as far south as Cincinnati, St. Louis, Kansas City, London, Amsterdam and central Germany. In much of North America, Europe and Asia, expanses of open tundra stretched thousands of miles.</p>
        <p>How might the climatic upheavals of the Pleistocene have set the stage for the rise of domestication? First, simply by forcing man and animals together. Across these treeless expanses, man and the wild horses, bison, mammoths, reindeer and cattle he hunted lived on terms of intimacy that have scarcely been duplicated since. But there is something else that was biologically special about this time in laying the groundwork for domestication: the rigors of climate change acted to select those very biological traits that would prove crucial to domestication.</p>
        <p>The million years that preceded the final retreat of the glaciers was not just a single "ice age," but more correctly a series of ice ages, marked by enormous swings in climate that occurred with -- geologically speaking -- enormous rapidity. Glaciations occurred about every 100,000 years, alternating with interglacial periods when temperatures rose to within a few degrees of today's and the ice sheets retreated northward. Analysis of fossil pollen samples show that the retreat of the glaciers was followed by the replacement of tundra and grassland plants with spruce forests and then oak. The ice sheets moved as much as 200 feet per year at their swiftest. The entire process was accompanied by other environmental swings -- in precipitation, ocean levels and lake sizes. A series of smaller and faster fluctuations occurred within each major glacial period, but even these small cycles were on the order of several degrees over a few hundred years, much greater than anything in historical experience.</p>
        <p>Raymond P. Coppinger, a biologist at Hampshire College in Massachusetts, writing with Charles K. Smith, a professor of English at the University of Massachusetts, advances the argument that such a traumatic fluctuation in habitat would have "penalized" any high degree of specialization within a species. As ranges expanded and contracted, as the forests moved northward behind the retreating ice cover and then were covered by the returning glaciers, a species that was locked into a single, highly specialized mode of existence would be less competitive. It is risky to make correlations between extinctions and climate, but the entire glacial epoch was marked by the displacement of many animals from their accustomed ranges and by sudden extinctions that may have left many ecological niches unfilled. An enormous variety of new animals appeared and disappeared -- including mastodons, mammoths, giant sheep and goats, saber-toothed tigers and huge-horned rhinos.</p>
        <p>But others came through the Pleistocene with flying colors. Those who succeeded apparently were able to take quick advantage of expanding ranges in the wake of the retreating glaciers, to adapt to a new environment and to fill the vacant niches. The wild sheep was one example of successful adaptation, spreading its range throughout most of the world during the intervals of glacial retreat.</p>
        <p>Adaptability is of course not a directly selectable genetic trait, like eye color. Rather, whether a species successfully adapts to a changing environment depends in part on the amount of natural variation that exists within the species. That variation, as Darwin demonstrated, is essential for the working of evolution: it makes it possible for new advantageous traits to be selected or new species to branch out when environmental conditions so dictate. A species of hare whose members come in shades from white to dark gray, for example, will have more genetic raw material to draw on if environmental changes -- say, the advance of glaciers -- suddenly make a pure white coat preferable for camouflage.</p>
        <p>The variation within a species is normally limited, however, both by natural selection itself and by basic rules of genetics and development. But there is one source of enormous variation within a species that can be tapped -- the change that all mammals and birds undergo in the course of developing from an infant to an adult. The range of variation in any adult population is minuscule compared with the differences that separate the average adult from the average juvenile. Physical characteristics -- everything from body shape and color to internal organs -- and behavior both change dramatically during development. If the genes that control this development process change in such a way that adulthood is reached before the "normal" process of development is complete, youthful characteristics will be locked in. This process is called neoteny and has been well documented in the physical evolution of many modern species, man included. Human and chimpanzee babies, for instance, are in many respects similar in facial appearance, with high, domed foreheads and rounded cheeks; adult humans retain more of these characteristics than do adult chimps.</p>
        <p>Even relatively small changes in the genes that determine the rate of development can produce enormous changes in the adult form. Through the process of neoteny a whole slew of new traits may be introduced very rapidly, thereby increasing the variation available for natural selection to act upon. But more important, the very characteristics of neotenates, even unrefined by further selection, could themselves have proved advantageous in a changing world.</p>
        <p>The environmental changes that directly preceded the era of domestication would have been a powerful force favoring the selection of neotenic characteristics in many animals. Young mammals and birds show a curiosity about their surroundings, an ability to learn new things, a lack of fear of new situations and even an undiscriminating willingness to associate and play with members of other species -- all of which are lost as they mature into adults and develop the more predictable and fixed sequences of behavior needed to hunt or forage, maintain their place in the social hierarchy and compete for mates. But curiosity, a willingness to move into new territory and an ability to learn throughout life are advantageous characteristics for individuals faced with a swiftly expanding or contracting ecosystem.</p>
        <p>Behavioral studies by the biologist Valerius Geist at the University of Calgary suggest that that is precisely what happened in the case of sheep. In both physical appearance and in behavior, the farther today's wild sheep live from the eastern Mediterranean region, their point of geographic origin in the Pleistocene, the more pronounced their neotenic traits. The North American bighorn sheep, for example, whose ancestors arrived in America via the Bering Strait, act in distinctly more juvenile ways than do the Stone's sheep of British Columbia, the more primitive types they descended from. Typically, as rams mature, their behavior becomes more "adult" in several distinct ways: they display their horns more frequently, kick subordinates with their front legs and are less likely to mount ewes that are not in heat. In all of these characteristics, fully adult bighorn sheep behave in less adult ways than do Stone's sheep.</p>
        <p>The curiosity, the lack of a highly species-specific sense of recognition and the retention into adulthood of juvenile care-soliciting behavior (like begging for food) of neotenates would all have been factors in inducing dogs, sheep, cattle, horses and many other occupants of the Asian and European grasslands of the late glacial era to approach human encampments and to allow humans to approach them. In the same way, the neoteny that is part of our own evolutionary heritage may have made us willing to tolerate the proximity of other species: of dogs scavenging hunting parties, cats invading granaries to hunt mice, cattle and sheep robbing crops from fields.</p>
        <p>If the rise of agriculture and animal husbandry was not a revolution, it was perhaps a slow subversion that, once begun, could not be stopped. Agriculture changed human society in demographics and structure; the animals that entered into an alliance of mutual dependence with human beings changed in biology and behavior. The environment, too, changed -- first by forces purely natural as the glaciers retreated and the grassland habitat of many of the domesticates' forebears vanished in the forward march of oak forests across the landscape, then by forces artificial as a society built upon tillage and pasture slashed, burned and uprooted those forests to meet its growing needs. If there was nothing inevitable about the emergence of agriculture, there was everything inevitable about its spread, its triumph over older ways of subsistence and its irreversibility.</p>
        <p>The triumph of agriculture was part of a larger story of evolutionary change, in which nature itself was redefined. The template for evolution for at least the last 10,000 years has included man and the environment created by his agricultural symbioses. The romantic conception of nature that is still with us, one in which noble, independent creatures proudly live free in unspoiled splendor, is almost a sort of racial memory of our hunter-gatherer past. The nature of nature was forever changed by agriculture, even if our conception of nature was not.</p>
        <p>The animals that entered into a symbiosis with humans are now biologically adapted to a way of life that largely precludes a return to their predomesticated ways. Their expectation of care and feeding is a part of their very biological makeup. The transformation of the environment by agriculture has erected an equally formidable barrier against evolutionary revanchism: there is less and less "wild" for domesticated species to return to.</p>
        <p>Looking at the dependence of domesticated animals in much broader terms, it may be that evolution and time are now on the side of these species that some biologists classify as "degenerates." Dependence not only means there is no turning back; it has actually become such a powerful evolutionary force that it is ushering in a new evolutionary age -- what Coppinger terms an "age of interdependent forms." The dominance of species living in this kind of symbiotic relationship will inevitably lead to a mass extinction of more specialized and independent species as great as that which struck the earth 65 million years ago with the vanishing of the dinosaurs: "The king of beasts will have been outcompeted by the cooperative strategy of the house cat," as Coppinger says.</p>
        <p>A glance at the population growth of man and his fellow degenerates readily substantiates that species outside the dependent alliance simply are incapable of reproducing as swiftly as those within. In 1860, man and domestic species accounted for 5 percent of terrestrial animal biomass -- the net total weight of all animal life on the continents. Today the figure is approximately 20 percent; by 2020 it may be 40 percent, and, if world population reaches 12 billion, as seems possible before it levels off, the figure will be 60 percent sometime in the middle of the next century.</p>
        <p>All of which is not necessarily the environmental disaster that is so often depicted by those who point with alarm to the extinction of species and the "appropriation" of ever more of the earth's resources by humans. Change, to an evolutionist, is not good or bad; it is simply inevitable. The dominance of man and domesticated animals and plants is not the end of nature; it is no more than the beginning of yet another new period in nature's long and varied history. The same evolutionary forces that have brought forth new species, our own included, have eliminated species as well. New ecological balances have repeatedly replaced old as mass extinction has followed mass extinction.</p>
        <p>The dependence of domestic plants and animals upon humans is part of something much larger than us or them. In a moral sense, it represents a responsibility that has been thrust upon us that it is too late for us to renounce. In an evolutionary sense, it may be something that we could not renounce even if we tried. 'MUST WE KILL THE MOUSE?'</p>
        <p>MANY ANIMALS HAVE found it to their advantage to associate with humans. We've just been slow to recognize the fact.</p>
        <p>"Must we kill the mouse?" a little girl asks her mother in an advertisement in The Animals' Agenda, an animal rights magazine: "No, honey," the mother replies, "the world is big enough for all of us. The mouse is intelligent and wants very much to live. We just want him out of our home and into the woods where he belongs." The solution -- available for a mere $10 -- is a live-animal trap complete with a patented "Freedom Door" ("delays escape so mouse must eat thru cracker to freedom, avoiding contact with captor," though it is not clear which party this feature is meant to benefit).</p>
        <p>The significant feature of this advertisement, however, is the contention that what the mouse really wants is to be out in the woods -- back in "nature." It is a view that fits well with the simple picture of nature as a place where animals live out their peaceful lives, far from the disturbing influence of man. In Takoma Park, Md., which has the distinction of being a nuclear-free zone, one of the handful of American cities that can boast of having elected a Marxist mayor and home to a number of vocal animal rights activists, this nice picture of an orderly natural world came into play on a slightly grander scale a few years ago when the town was overrun with rats. After poison was found to be too dangerous, the local government decided to provide residents with glue traps. The animal activists swung into action and demanded that live traps be offered instead to those who wanted them.</p>
        <p>Coming to the defense of an animal usually considered a public-health menace was at least ideologically laudable -- as the animal rights movement, in spite of its philosophical credo of equal rights for all species, tends to be partial to the rights of cute, furry animals readily amenable to anthropomorphic projections. But the problem then arose about what to do with a large collection of captured rats in what is a very urban suburb of Washington. The animal rights activists suggested that the rats could be released into a "natural" habitat. Where? Frederick County, suggested one. The farmers of that rural county, who are among those who bear the brunt of an estimated $1 billion nationally every year from mice and rats, were not amused.</p>
        <p>But the mice and rats in question would probably not have been amused either. The image of furry animals safely nesting in the woods has little to do with the evolutionary reality of rats and mice. After eating its way through the Freedom Door, the trapped mouse will either head for a nearby house, be eaten or freeze or starve to death in the woods.</p>
        <p>Neither rats nor house mice are native to North America or Europe. To be sure, the house mouse (</p>
        <p>Mus musculus)</p>
        <p>will on occasion nest in meadows or grainfields (not woods); in temperate areas like California and Florida, the black rat (</p>
        <p>Rattus rattus)</p>
        <p>will nest in trees, and the Norway rat (</p>
        <p>Rattus norvegicus)</p>
        <p>will summer in grainfields. But all live in close association with man by preference. By virtue of several thousand years of co-evolution and an ability to eat anything that we do, rats and house mice are supremely adapted to living inside walls and garbage dumps. Biologists call the species "human commensals" -- they eat at our table, sometimes literally.</p>
        <p>The warmth, incidental protection from predators (we like sharing our shelter with snakes even less than with mice and rats) and bountiful food supply of a house provided a niche that allowed rat and house mouse populations to explode and spread over the face of the earth. House mice, in fact, compete poorly with most wild indigenous small mammals; their success is a direct result of their ability to colonize human habitations. The black rat and Norway rat, which originated in the Far East, likewise became human commensals as soon as the first permanent human settlements were established.</p>
        <p>So the solution is not so neat and simple as one of restoring the mouse to "nature." When it's in our house it already is in nature. By its evolutionary history, by its feeding habits and by its nesting habits, cohabitation with man is the way of life the house mouse has adapted to.</p>
