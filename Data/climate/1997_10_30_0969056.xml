        <p>Some of my politically conservative compeers have been telling wild tales about the Clinton Administration. They see vast conspiracies in the small-time chicanery of Whitewater, Castle Grande and the Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan. They view the shabby, provincial Rose Law Firm as a super-villain cabal worth a new Batman film. They experience fits of credulity about drug smuggling at the airport in Mena, Ark., and an adolescent Bill Clinton's K.G.B. contacts. They monger gossip about the President and his wife participating in what may be politely termed a rich and varied social life, and they claim that webs of hidden influence are spun from such extramaritalities.</p>
        <p>I'm a right-wing nut myself -- believing in flat tax, Second Amendment rights, God and other things liberals find incredible. But I do not believe Vince Foster was kidnapped by space aliens or murdered by a jealousy-maddened Ruth Bader Ginsburg or whatever the latest canard is. More likely Mr. Foster came to Washington with people he thought were friends, hated the place, was having personal problems and then discovered that he was to be left holding a large bag of Whitewater effluvium. In the matter of his own death, poor Mr. Foster had what a prosecutor (special or otherwise) would call ''motive, means and opportunity.''</p>

        <p>I'm a right-wing nut myself -- believing in flat tax, Second Amendment rights, God and other things liberals find incredible. But I do not believe Vince Foster was kidnapped by space aliens or murdered by a jealousy-maddened Ruth Bader Ginsburg or whatever the latest canard is. More likely Mr. Foster came to Washington with people he thought were friends, hated the place, was having personal problems and then discovered that he was to be left holding a large bag of Whitewater effluvium. In the matter of his own death, poor Mr. Foster had what a prosecutor (special or otherwise) would call ''motive, means and opportunity.''</p>
        <p>I don't understand why conservatives resort to the fabulous to discredit such a less-than-fabulous Administration. The reality of the Clinton Presidency is damning enough. The energy would be better spent attacking Mr. Clinton's political principles -- if and when he shows any.</p>
        <p>Maybe this is the problem. Mr. Clinton is so elusive that conservatives are driven to romance by frustration. Here is a man who no one disputes is untrustworthy but whom everyone agrees to like. A man of dubious courage and character who defeats not one but two war heroes. A man who beats Republicans by running as one. A man who is able to use arguments from the right, the left and indeed from thin air (i.e., global warming) to further a political agenda that seems to consist of nothing but making everything more political.</p>
        <p>Conspiracy theories are the traditional consolation of the powerless, and conservatives feel powerless watching President Clinton benefit from the cold war victory and the free market success won by conservative ideas. He is a cheerleader who thinks he carried the ball, a cheerleader for the other side at that. In the past we've seen powerless conservatives create McCarthyism, the John Birch Society and water fluoridation hysteria just as we've seen powerless liberals create Psychology, Sociology, Anthropology and Political Science. Now it's the conservatives' turn to play the fools again.</p>
        <p>Conspiracy theories are also the consolation of the stupid. Bill Clinton as President of the United States is a perplexing phenomenon. A conspiracy might explain it. Contrary to certain appearances, liberals do not have a monopoly on thickheadedness. When a stupid person espouses a conspiracy theory, he is saying, ''The world is so stupid that, given some special information, even I can understand it.''</p>
        <p>But although all conservatives are exasperated with Bill Clinton and some are stupid, too, the best reason for conservatives to pull the longbow about the Presidency is to get attention. The public is not listening to the substantive points conservatives are making -- about sloppy foreign policy, entitlement burdens, military unpreparedness, tyrannical regulatory powers and other fundamental issues. In a time of no international threats and a prospering economy (check today's Hang Seng closing to make sure these things are still true), the public doesn't care about political principles. With giddy insouciance Americans support family values legislation, then go out and act like the cast of ''Melrose Place.'' They vote for tax cuts, they vote for benefit increases, and they often don't vote at all. An entire New Jersey gubernatorial race is being fought on the issue of car insurance rates.</p>
        <p>If it makes conservatives feel better, nobody is listening to Bill Clinton, either. Watch him desperately trying for a ''place in history'' -- one week it's as welfare reform maestro, the next week as race relations adept, then ecology maven, education cognoscente, etc. He may come back in a hundred years to find that his historical place is ''whatshisname with two terms between Bush pere and Bush fils.''</p>
        <p>I think Bill Clinton and the conservative bunko merchants should go on one of those daytime television shows. The President could confess that he did everything of which he's accused. The conservative pundits could admit that they made up every allegation. All concerned could hug and cry. And maybe somebody would tune in.</p>
