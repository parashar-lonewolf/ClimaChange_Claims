        <p>President Clinton and the leaders of Russia, Japan and Western Europe emerged from their marathon meetings in Denver over the weekend like tired college students who had endured a grueling round of final exams.

        <p>President Clinton and the leaders of Russia, Japan and Western Europe emerged from their marathon meetings in Denver over the weekend like tired college students who had endured a grueling round of final exams. Their joint declarations covered such a bewildering array of subjects, from Bosnia to global warming to trade barriers, that it was hard to imagine that they did justice to any of them. The blurred focus obscured a couple of significant accomplishments, however. One was the further integration of Russia's President, Boris Yeltsin, into the West's concerns, and the other was a new economic agenda for the world's richest countries.</p>
        <p>As host of the Denver summit, Mr. Clinton rankled feelings among some colleagues, especially Japan, by insisting that Mr. Yeltsin become a nearly full-fledged member of the exclusive club of nations known as the Group of Seven. In financial terms, Russia is clearly not in the same league as the other G-7 countries that have met annually since 1975 to discuss economic problems. But since the collapse of Communism, Russia has crept its way in. For the United States, inviting Russia this past weekend was a crucial payback for Russia's reluctant acceptance of NATO expansion, to be formalized in Madrid next month.</p>
        <p>In return, Mr. Yeltsin gave welcome new promises to speed economic reform at home. Russia agreed just before the summit to write off most  of its Soviet-era debt, and in Denver Mr. Yeltsin promised to push hard for improved tax collection, a step that economists consider crucial to restoring Russian solvency. American officials were impressed that Russia had floated its first 10-year bond issue since 1913. But it was far from clear that Russia will make sufficient progress toward a legal system and open markets to meet the criteria for joining the World Trade Organization next year.</p>
        <p>A year ago Mr. Yeltsin was a physically ravaged man, struggling to survive politically and unable to attend the economic summit meeting in Lyons, France. This past weekend he seemed more fit than in years. He joined with his summit colleagues to call for the reconstruction of Bosnia and went along with a renewed threat of sanctions against Iraq. But there were disquieting signs that Mr. Yeltsin remains on the defensive at home because of the United States' ill-considered drive for NATO expansion. Russian officials offered little assurance, for example, that they would win parliamentary approval of the Start 2 nuclear arms treaty in the Russian Parliament any time soon.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Yeltsin's presence overshadowed the other work of the summit, the conferees nudged a few economic issues forward and papered over their differences in several areas. Europe continues to complain about lagging American aid for Africa, but there was at least an agreement to accelerate trade and investment for countries with open markets. The summit gave a welcome if vague push toward closer collaboration on global warming and the spread of infectious diseases. A pledge to make bribery by multinational companies a crime might eventually reduce corruption in the world economy.</p>
        <p>Conspicuous by its absence in the final communique was much reference to Europe's painful struggle to meet the austere requirements of a new monetary union without deepening unemployment, especially in France and Germany. While bragging about America's recent economic success, Mr. Clinton wisely avoided lecturing his European colleagues about how to solve their problems. He seemed more intent on creating a diversion from their crises at home in the warm Rocky Mountain sunshine.</p>
