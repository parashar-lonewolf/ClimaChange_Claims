        <p>IT'S MY PARTY TOO</p>
        <p>The Battle for the Heart of the GOP</p>
        <p>and the Future of America.</p>
        <p>By Christine Todd Whitman.</p>
        <p>247 pp. The Penguin Press. $24.95.</p>
        <p>Let me confess up front to being one of those ideologically androgynous Democrats who think the revival of Rockefeller Republicanism is a prerequisite for saving the Republic. You know the type -- we perked up when Colin Powell flirted with a presidential run, can't say enough about anyone named Chafee and feel genuinely hopeful about Arnold because he's forging a fresh model of Republicanism in the nation's most consequential state. So I raced through ''It's My Party Too'' with an overwhelming feeling of ''it's about time!'' -- about time, that is, that a prominent moderate Republican like Christine Todd Whitman warned that her party's takeover by what she calls ''social fundamentalists'' needs to be fought tooth and nail by Republicans.</p>
        <p>Yet beyond this call to arms, which Whitman in general issues admirably, her book is interesting for what its existence says about this moment in our public life. When a successful politician like Whitman, a former governor of New Jersey and administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in George W. Bush's first term, who plainly has national aspirations, has calculated that striking out against the far right is good not only for her party and her country (which seems obvious) but for her political future (which doesn't), it's worth taking notice.</p>
        <p>Whitman begins by dismissing the 2004 election as a signal of a new era of Republican dominance and by characterizing evangelicals' claim that they won Bush re-election as ''overblown'': ''The president's 3-percentage-point popular vote margin was the smallest margin of any incumbent president ever to win re-election,'' she notes, arguing that if the Republican Party caters to its ''ideological zealots'' on issues like gay marriage and stem cell research, it will alienate mainstream voters and risk marginalizing itself. Instead, she says, her party should return to ''the core Republican values'' -- ''smaller government, fiscal responsibility and strong security'' -- that unite conservatives and moderates, ''even moderates in the Democratic Party.''+</p>
        <p>''Ironically, Barry Goldwater would be considered a moderate today, if not in temperament at least in many of his principles,'' Whitman writes, referring to Goldwater's positions on abortion and homosexuals in the military. In passages that will surely bore the pundits but possibly resonate with normal Americans, Whitman repeatedly makes the case for a productive political center, insists that politics is not just about winning elections but about solving problems, and laments the ''harsh tenor'' of our political culture, which is ''making it increasingly difficult to hold rational discussions about the most important issues facing the country.'' Along the way she sprinkles in scenes from her life and career (Whitman's parents met at the Republican convention in 1932, not otherwise ''a good year for the G.O.P.'').</p>
        <p>While Whitman's frustration with her stint as Bush's environmental chief is evident, her book offers a textbook contrast with Paul O'Neill's scathing post-Treasury indictment of the administration. Whitman seems to intend to remain a player, and so makes clear on matters like regulation and global warming where she disagreed with administration policy while remaining loyal to the president who appointed her. It's a shame that O'Neill -- another talented moderate whose private sector work on health care reform has been nationally important -- didn't exercise the same judgment and so retain a little more influence in party circles.</p>
        <p>Given Whitman's appealing reasonableness, the book's biggest disappointment is its failure to address the fiscal charades with which the Republican Party continues to bamboozle the country. This is also the surest sign she is entertaining the idea of running for president. The party's cardinal sin today is its ceaseless drumbeat for deeper tax cuts -- when Republican leaders know full well that the baby boomers' retirement can't be paid for with the taxes we are raising now, that further long-term tax cuts only deepen the hole and that federal tax rates at Clinton-era levels are simply not an impediment to robust growth (as the 1990's proved). As they know, just seven programs make up 75 percent of federal spending: Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, military and civil service pensions, defense and interest on the debt. That's ''big government.'' Yet Republicans in Congress and the White House aren't trying to cut a dime of it. And that's before you toss in everything from NASA to the national parks, not to mention homeland security. Whitman knows all this too, of course -- but she seems to think Republican primary voters aren't ready to hear it out loud. Still, expecting too much candor from a politician preparing herself for a national race seems unfair, or at least hopeless. On my scorecard, Whitman's ratio of Big Truths Uttered to Big Issues Disingenously Sidestepped is well above the acceptable range for an undeclared presidential candidate.</p>
        <p>Especially given where we are. Think about it: in 2004, John Kerry wouldn't have stood behind Richard Nixon's combined plans for universal health coverage and a minimum family income because Nixon's agenda from the early 1970's is way too liberal for the mainstream Democratic Party today.</p>
