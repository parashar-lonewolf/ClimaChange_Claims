        <p>Marlborough Gallery  211 West 19th Street, Chelsea  Through March 24</p>
        <p>Black rubber tires, cut up and recycled into sculptures, are Chakaia Booker's tough, aggressive signature medium, and in this show they are given even more expressive power. She uses patterned treads, thicknesses, textures, subtle differences in color (steel radials give the most chromatic effect) to different advantage in each object.</p>
        <p>To Ms. Booker, black symbolizes the strength of African identity, suggests Charlotta Kotik of the Brooklyn Museum of Art in a catalog preface to the show, but her stress on the color's nuances is meant to evoke the complexities of black's human application.</p>
        <p>The work in this show is more figural than before. A powerful example is ''Spirit Hunter (Industrialized Nkisi Nkondi-Barbwire),'' approximately 10 1/2 by 11 by 12 feet, a huge loop that arcs up and backward from a front ''leg'' resting on the floor to come down again on a back leg some feet behind. Ribbed like a vertebra, and studded with sharp fins cut from sections of tire, it is held together by big nuts and bolts that show as part of the work. Its shape is inspired by the coils of razor-edged wire put up to deter crime in urban and industrial neighborhoods, but it has the spirit of a dragon's tail.</p>
        <p>The large relief sculpture ''Acid Rain,'' an Abstract Expressionist wall of cleverly orchestrated tire parts from bicycle to pickup truck size, writhes rhythmically with assertive forms. Particularly arresting is a gestural swath near the top that looks like an open body cavity, with a splayed rib cage made of repetitive pieces of bicycle tires and rubber tubes.</p>
        <p>More anthropomorphic pieces include ''Baby Girl,'' a convoluted massing of cut and mangled tire pieces, rubber tubes and gaskets. The central portion of this decidedly female presence is arranged to suggest a vagina.</p>
        <p>A row of small wall sculptures, although entirely abstract, put one in mind of figural themes from landscape to African masks. Ms. Booker's fluency with her recalcitrant material deserves close study. Old tires never die, but in Ms. Booker's hands they become pure poetry.</p>
