        <p>Op-Ed article by George Packer says Democrats, who in 2000 won presidential popular vote, equal split in Senate and stayed about even in House, have retreated to defensive cringe, reflecting psychology of defeat that is so strongly ingrained in Democrats; says now, out of power, Democrats enjoy luxury of being opposition party closer to majority of Americans than is party in power, but Democratic leaders say nothing about Bush presidency's seeming governing ideology: 'long live big business'; says Democratic Party, along with Republican Party, have become nothing but fund-raising machines; says only way to change direction is hard way, from below, much as grass-roots Republicans did after Barry Goldwater's landslide defeat in 1964; drawings (M)</p>

        <p>These mental habits partly account for the far greater single-mindedness of the Republicans in the Battle of Florida: from Election Day on they acted as if they had a natural right to win. But since President Bush's inauguration, the party that won the presidential popular vote and an equal split in the Senate, while staying about even in the House, has largely fallen silent in the face of repeated provocation. When President Bush broke his campaign promise to cap carbon dioxide emissions and then shrugged off the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, Al Gore, the candidate who won the popular vote by half a million, was apparently too busy mending fences in Tennessee to say one word about an issue that once inspired him to write an entire book.</p>
        <p>One might imagine that the Democrats' confusion or paralysis is due to their being used to holding power. In fact, it's the opposite. They have retreated to a deeply familiar posture: the defensive cringe. The psychology of defeat is strongly ingrained in Democrats, especially those under 50. Born in 1960, I had entered my fourth decade before I cast a vote for a winning presidential candidate. Many of the party's recent heroes made their reputations and gave their great speeches amid the pathos of noble defeat: Eugene McCarthy resurrecting Adlai Stevenson at the 1960 convention (''Do not leave this prophet without honor in his own party''); Edward Kennedy in 1980, Mario Cuomo in 1984 and Jesse Jackson in 1988 making passionate appeals to the party's traditional commitment to the downtrodden.</p>
        <p>The conservative movement of the late 20th century framed the terms of political debate so successfully that the Democratic position became the embattled view on a host of issues. For years, Democrats tried to win elections by disguising or blurring their true thoughts, or else by exchanging them for others. They weren't for more spending, just fiscal responsibility. They weren't really against tax cuts, but they wanted to save Social Security first. They wanted to mend affirmative action, not end it. They wouldn't ask, and they wouldn't tell.</p>
        <p>The Clinton years helped rid Democrats of the labels -- soft on crime and welfare, big-spending, unpatriotic -- that had stuck to them since the 60's. But the habits of mental defensiveness and disguise are not as easy to break, and it's possible that for some the disguise became reality. Mr. Clinton himself achieved most of his success by turning these habits into a master strategy. Throughout the 90's, the rationale for the party's creeping centrism was victory.</p>
        <p>Now, out of power, Democrats enjoy the luxury of being, in terms of their positions on issues, an opposition party closer to the majority of Americans than is the party in power -- with that much more freedom to say what they mean.</p>
        <p>The question is, do Democrats know what they mean? And if they know, can they break old habits and say it now that the price is no longer likely defeat?</p>
        <p>The election of 2000 was not the election of 1980 or 1994. The once-formidable conservative movement is spent. If the second Bush presidency has a governing ideology, it isn't the populist conservatism that emboldened Republicans from Ronald Reagan to Newt Gingrich with the potent message, ''Get the government off my back.'' It's simply, ''Long live big business,'' the philosophy of McKinley, Harding and Coolidge. According to a recent poll, two-thirds of Americans think President Bush cares more about the interests of large corporations than about the interests of ordinary people. This is not a philosophy that Republicans can speak plainly, so they find themselves in the disadvantageous position that Democrats held for so long: they have to blur and disguise, to manipulate language into sequences of poll-tested catchwords like ''civility'' and ''bipartisan.'' But in case there's any lingering doubt, the administration's actions, from ergonomics to arsenic, indicate that the disguise is only that.</p>
        <p>George W. Bush's presidency is almost forcing Democrats to declare their core belief. Do they have one as simple and powerful as the Republicans' ''freedom''? For most of the party's history, it could be summed up in the word ''equality.'' In the 19th century, the Democratic idea of equality meant opposition to government interventions in economic life because these tended to favor the wealthy and powerful.</p>
        <p>In the 20th century, equality meant support for government programs that insulated ordinary people against the harsher effects of industrial capitalism. Perhaps the word will mean something different in the 21st century. A useful role for the Democratic Party would be to articulate it.</p>
        <p>Today the word equality might not fly with focus groups; it is easily taken to mean coercive redistribution or, in the Republicans' favorite phrase, class warfare. Throughout American history, it has almost always meant equality of opportunity, not of condition. But when the ideal of equal opportunity is mocked by vast inequality of condition, Americans start losing their sense of a common purpose or fate.</p>
        <p>This is increasingly the reality in an age of Internet billionaires, the working poor and a middle class left largely alone by government to deal with vast economic changes. President Bush's actions and proposals make the mockery of equality complete, and nothing demonstrates this more dramatically than his drive to eliminate the estate tax, a move that would entrench a hereditary aristocracy like the one that created George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>The fact that total repeal of the estate tax now seems unlikely shows that a bias toward equality still informs Americans' sensibilities. The fact that it took a public campaign by billionaires to bring those sensibilities into focus shows the lack of direction from the Democratic Party leadership.</p>
        <p>It's a mistake, though, to think of a party just in terms of its leaders. Waiting for someone to step forward and replace the disgraced Bill Clinton or the muted Al Gore is beside the point. Both parties have become fund-raising machines, and the only way to change their direction is the hard way, from below.</p>
        <p>In a new book, ''Before the Storm,'' Rick Perlstein shows how grass-roots Republicans responded to Barry Goldwater's landslide defeat in 1964 -- not by trying to install new party leaders, but by forming think tanks, training activists, knocking on doors and electing true believers to local offices. Conservative Republicans, who knew what they were about, refused to be discouraged by a mere 16-million-vote defeat. Instead, they took it to mean that they could move the country in their direction. By 1980 their new Goldwater had emerged as president.</p>
        <p>Al Gore lost, officially, by 537 votes. All that's left is for Democrats to decide what they're about.</p>
