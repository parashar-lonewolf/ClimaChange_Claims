        <p>The Bush administration, facing fresh criticism on several fronts in climate talks here, maintained its opposition on Wednesday not only to new targets for cutting emissions linked to global warming but also to any informal discussions that might even touch on the subject.</p>
        <p>In an unusually direct rebuke, Prime Minister Paul Martin of Canada singled out the United States at a news conference for not joining international efforts to require curbs on carbon dioxide and the other greenhouse gases. ''To the reticent nations, including the United States, I say this: There is such a thing as a global conscience,'' Mr. Martin said. ''And now is the time to listen to it.''</p>

        <p>The Bush administration, facing fresh criticism on several fronts in climate talks here, maintained its opposition on Wednesday not only to new targets for cutting emissions linked to global warming but also to any informal discussions that might even touch on the subject.</p>
        <p>In an unusually direct rebuke, Prime Minister Paul Martin of Canada singled out the United States at a news conference for not joining international efforts to require curbs on carbon dioxide and the other greenhouse gases. ''To the reticent nations, including the United States, I say this: There is such a thing as a global conscience,'' Mr. Martin said. ''And now is the time to listen to it.''</p>
        <p>Separately, representatives from the Eskimo native culture of the Arctic, which for 5,000 years has used sea ice as a platform for hunting and transportation, announced that they had filed a petition against the United States on Wednesday in the Washington offices of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, a body examining claims of rights abuses in the Americas.</p>
        <p>The petition asserts that unabated American emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases are threatening Eskimo traditions and presses the United States to curb the gases.</p>
        <p>Bush administration officials attending the conference, convened to discuss updates to a set of international agreements including the Kyoto Protocol, said they had not yet seen the petition and so declined to comment. They also rebuffed critics of their stance in the talks, saying the United States was pursuing independent actions to slow growth in emissions and conducting research with other countries on new, less polluting energy technologies.</p>
        <p>The meeting is the latest in a 17-year string of conferences that produced a 1992 treaty pledging, but not requiring, cuts in greenhouse gases and a 1997 addendum, the Kyoto Protocol, that has binding targets and a 2012 deadline but for only three dozen industrialized countries.</p>
        <p>The United States is a party to the first pact, the Framework Convention on Climate Change. But President Bush rejected the Kyoto pact, saying that the emissions cuts would harm the economy.</p>
        <p>The Montreal conference has parallel discussions under way on the two pacts. Parties to Kyoto are required to consider new targets and timetables beyond 2012.</p>
        <p>The American delegation has insisted repeatedly that there be no new talks to reconsider aspects of the 1992 framework treaty. It is not involved in talks related to the Kyoto treaty because it is not a party to it.</p>
        <p>At a news conference on Wednesday, Paula J. Dobriansky, under secretary of state for democracy and global affairs and the top American official at the meeting, said the framework treaty allowed countries to pursue independent efforts.</p>
        <p>''We believe that the best way forward is acknowledging the fact that there are different approaches that have been represented here at this gathering, and one size does not fit all,'' she said.</p>
