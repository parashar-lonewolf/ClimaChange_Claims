        <p>Adversaries' Envoys In a Deepening Standoff  As senior Bush administration officials prepared for a new round of arm-twisting aimed at resolving the dangerous military standoff between India and Pakistan, the two adversaries' ambassadors in Washington each spoke in terms that showed little flexibility or movement toward negotiations. Meanwhile, President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan and Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee of India both headed for a regional conference in Kazakhstan, where President Vladimir Putin of Russia has offered to serve as a broker in a meeting between them.</p>

        <p>Israel Backs Military Option  As Israeli forces swept through the West Bank city of Nablus for a third day, the country's leaders said that unilateral military action was the best path to security. George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, is scheduled to visit Israel to promote an overhaul of the Palestinian security forces that would make them more effective at blocking violence against Israel. But with Israeli troops raiding Palestinian areas regularly, the notion of cooperation between the Israeli and Palestinian security forces has been all but abandoned.</p>

        <p>Arrests in Mexico Killings  Sixteen people were jailed in Mexico on suspicion of killing 26 villagers from rural Oaxaca in a vendetta over land. The suspects were residents of nearby villages that have fought the people of Santiago Xochiltepec for many years. A state prosecutor said he had not ruled out the possibility that the massacre had its roots in a fight between low-level drug traffickers.</p>

        <p>Swiss Ease Abortion Laws  Swiss voters have agreed to ease the country's strict abortion laws, and to bring them closer to much of the rest of the continent's laws and the actual practice in Switzerland. Abortions will be allowed in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, provided the woman requests the procedure in writing and agrees to counseling and medical advice.</p>
        <p>A4</p>
        <p>Canadian Minister Ousted  Canada's finance minister, Paul Martin, left, has been forced to resign by Prime Minister Jean Chrétien in a contest over the leadership of the Liberal Party that has thrown the government into its largest crisis yet. Mr. Chrétien had warned that he would fire anyone organizing for the convention to decide who will be the leader, and Mr. Martin has been planning a run at the leadership post for years. He was replaced by Deputy Prime Minister John Manley, a moderate former tax lawyer and loyal ally of Mr. Chrétien's.</p>

        <p>Choosing Afghan Leaders  With a conference to pick a transitional government to run Afghanistan for up to two years a week away, enthusiasm and political pressures have risen in equal measure.</p>

        <p>C.I.A. on Hijacker's Trail Months Earlier Than It Said  The Central Intelligence Agency has said in a classified chronology submitted to Congress that it had picked up the trail of a Qaeda operative who turned out to be a Sept. 11 hijacker months earlier than it has previously acknowledged, government officials said.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Perils of a Prosecution Witness  Essam Al Ridi, a former federal witness, helped convict a Qaeda member early last year in connection with a plot to bomb American embassies. But since then, Mr. Al Ridi said, he has faced reprisals, including a detention during a trip home to Egypt, and the loss of his job with a Middle Eastern airline. He sees his treatment as a sign of potential perils facing Arabs and Muslims who assist the F.B.I. in the war on terror.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>A Shift on Global Warming  In a stark shift for the Bush administration, the United States has sent a report to the United Nations detailing far-reaching effects that it says global warming will inflict on the American environment. The administration for the first time places most of the blame for recent global warming on human actions. But while the report says the environment will be changed substantially in the next few decades, it does not advocate major changes in administration policy on greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Candidates Clash in Alabama  For the last 10 years, the all-but-invulnerable occupant of Alabama's Seventh Congressional District seat has been Earl F. Hilliard, the state's first black representative since Reconstruction. But Mr. Hilliard suddenly finds himself battling for his political life against a lawyer, Artur Davis, in a Democratic primary contest that is getting dirtier by the day.</p>
        <p>A10</p>
        <p>When Faith and Zoning Collide  A federal law enacted in 2000 prohibits zoning regulations that impose a substantial burden on religious exercise unless the government can show that there is a compelling interest in doing so, and that there is no less restrictive option. The measure has unleashed a torrent of litigation.</p>
        <p>A10</p>
        <p>A Shrinking Shrimp Market  Shrimpers in Louisiana's Cajun country are facing prices at the pier that are lower than they have been in decades. Demand has suffered through an economic hangover and a post-Sept. 11 plunge in travel and entertainment spending.</p>
        <p>A13</p>
        <p>Studying Cloning's Potential  Cows implanted with cells taken from a cloned embryo did not experience immune rejection, showing the potential of therapeutic cloning, researchers said. The technology is opposed by many, but some scientists who oppose the cloning of humans say that therapeutic cloning should be pursued because it could supply healthy tissue to treat a variety of illnesses.</p>

        <p>Studies Say Welfare Rules May Discourage Marriage  Just as the White House is seeking welfare legislation with more stringent work requirements and more support for marriage, new research findings in Connecticut and Iowa show that the stricter rules significantly reduce the chances that a single mother will wed.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Harbor on a Hard Drive  Over the next decade, millions of tons of silt, sand and muck must be dredged from New York Harbor to keep the port competitive. Knowing what is in that mud, how it moves and where pollutants in it come from could save hundreds of millions of dollars. In pursuit of the answers, experts are using computer models to create what may be the most sophisticated analysis ever of how a harbor system actually works.</p>

        <p>Parkway Disrupted by Blaze  One home was destroyed and nine others were damaged, hundreds of residents were evacuated, and a 24-mile stretch of the Garden State Parkway was closed yesterday by a windblown forest fire that engulfed more than 1,000 acres of tinder-dry pinelands several miles inland from the Central New Jersey shore.</p>
        <p>B1</p>
        <p>Relocating the Mentally Ill  When state officials moved in March to close Seaport Manor in Brooklyn, long one of New York's most notoriously troubled adult homes for the mentally ill, they pledged to do all they could to protect the safety and well-being of its nearly 300 residents. But the home's discharge records and interviews with officials show that the state, in coordination with Seaport's management, has merely been relocating many of the profoundly ill residents to other adult homes that have their own histories of neglect.</p>

        <p>Ground Zero on the Cusp  Many of them said they would be back to leave flowers and written messages for their dead relatives, and to mark a lifetime of anniversaries ahead. Still, a memorial service for the families of more than 2,800 victims of the World Trade Center attack held enough finality for organizers to call it the Ground Zero Closing Ceremony.</p>

But the transition has been far from smooth, and it now appears that it will be shorter than promised. People inside Merrill say the relationship between David H.

        <p>Books Take On Church Scandal  The sexual abuse scandal engulfing the Roman Catholic Church is about to become the subject of at least a half-dozen new books. But publishers are proceeding with trepidation, worried that the story may, in fact, repel the core Catholic audience.</p>
        <p>C1</p>
        <p>No Bankruptcy for Now  Directors at the embattled cable company Adelphia Communications decided not to seek bankruptcy protection, at least for now, according to people close to the situation. Still, the people said, the board would probably discuss a possible filing at another meeting which could come as early as this week.</p>
