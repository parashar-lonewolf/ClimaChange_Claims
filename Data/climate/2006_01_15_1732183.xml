        <p>THE United States needs to develop alternative sources of energy like wind power, in part to mitigate the effects of global warming, says Thierry Vandal, president and chief executive of Hydro-Québec, the electricity producer based in Montreal. Here are excerpts from a conversation:</p>
        <p>Q. Is global warming really happening?</p>
        <p>A. NASA came out with analysis of the year 2005 and concluded that it was the warmest year on record. That certainly seems to be telling us something. It's a potentially huge issue for all our societies.</p>
        <p>Q. Can you Canadians actually see the effects of the warming?</p>
        <p>A. Populations that reside in the far north, the Inuit, for example, tell us that on the basis of their traditions, they feel that something is going on. And in recent excursions, research ships up north have also detected dramatic evolution of some of the large glaciers. There is an abundance of facts that all point in the same direction. We certainly believe that as a provider of electricity we should be very, very concerned about this. That's why our focus is on renewable sources of energy. There's obviously a huge need for electricity -- it's the fuel of the information age. But we should be proactive in the way we address the supply of electricity.</p>
        <p>Q. Aside from the generation of power from water, you think that wind power is increasingly viable. Why?</p>
        <p>A. Technology. Clearly, this is a power source that is seeing some very interesting technological development. It's the development of power electronics and the materials that are used. And the scale of these facilities also has seen some development. All those factors combined make it a source of power that is not only renewable but also can be competitive in the power market.</p>
        <p>Q. Wind hasn't been seen as a very reliable source of power. Is that changing?</p>
        <p>A. Our largest wind farm 10 years ago was actually on the electricity grid about 20 percent of the hours of the year. In more recent wind farms that have been attached to the grid, the technology is allowing them to maintain a presence for more than 30 percent of the time.</p>
        <p>The electronics enhance our ability to control and optimize the production of energy on a more sustained basis. And composite materials mean that the blades are lighter and stronger and can therefore be used to produce at a larger scale. In a matter of 10 years, the scale of each turbine has been multiplied by a factor of 10. The efficiency of scale makes the whole sector more cost-competitive.</p>
        <p>Q. Does this technology come from General Electric?</p>
        <p>A. There are others, such as the Danish firm Vestas and a Spanish company named Gamesa. But certainly General Electric is showing strong leadership in this sector.</p>
        <p>Q. How big is the wind farm that you and G.E. are working on in northern Quebec?</p>
        <p>A. We have attached 500 megawatts to the grid, and we're going to be attaching 1,000 additional megawatts of wind power. That's under way. We're looking at buying an additional 2,000 megawatts. We'll soon be concluding the contracts. So that's 3,500 megawatts, which is enough to supply more than one million homes with energy for a year.</p>
        <p>Q. Will any of that power come to the United States?</p>
        <p>A. Yes, Hydro-Québec has a presence in the New York market and in the Northeast in general. We are looking at growing that presence over the next five years on the basis of renewable energy.</p>
        <p>Q.  Would a dip in the price of oil undermine the economics of what you're doing?</p>
        <p>A. No. Our focus on the development of wind and hydro started before the last spike in oil prices.</p>
        <p>Q. We're seeing resistance in Massachusetts to an offshore wind farm. Are you encountering any resistance in Quebec?</p>
        <p>A. There is clearly a need to focus this development in areas that are not sensitive from the point of view of recreational activities. The Quebec transmission grid is very extended because a lot of our hydro generation is quite far north. The ability to attach wind power, therefore, is easier than in more densely developed areas in the United States, where a lot of power is generated close to where it's consumed.</p>
        <p>If you're 100 meters away from a wind farm, noise is not a factor. Clearly, the industry is going to have to continue research on wind farms' interference with certain species of birds. But on balance, we believe wind farms can continue to be developed in a way that's sensitive to both humans and other species.</p>
        <p>Q. The American electricity grid can fail, as it did in August 2003. Has the grid been fixed?</p>
        <p>A. Extensive work is taking place. In the Energy Policy Act that was passed last year, Congress and the administration put a lot of focus on reliability. It's all pointing in the right direction.</p>
        <p>Q. So even though it's headed in the right direction, very little has actually been done?</p>
        <p>A. I wouldn't characterize it that way. We shouldn't minimize the importance of what's taking place at the industry level. There's a focus on new investment and also on having an industry that operates with higher grid reliability. We think 2005 was a year in which we moved forward in grid reliability. It doesn't mean that all the work is done.</p>
