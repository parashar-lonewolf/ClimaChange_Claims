        <p>Negotiators met behind guarded doors late tonight, trying to reach a consensus on a global warming treaty before their meeting breaks up on Saturday.</p>
        <p>''For the environment, it doesn't get any bigger than this,'' said Jennifer Morgan, the climate change specialist for the World Wildlife Fund, as she caught delegates on the way into the negotiating room for a last bit of arm twisting.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Jan Pronk, the overseer of the two-week meeting and the Dutch environment minister, had lowered expectations a notch, saying there would doubtless be issues that would be delayed and text that would remain unwritten. The next meetings are already scheduled, for May in Germany and for October in Morocco.</p>
        <p>But he and many participants said there was a decent chance that a general declaration of success was within reach by Saturday morning.</p>
        <p>The proposed treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, was drafted by more than 170 countries in 1997 and the session here was intended to flesh out the fine print. If enacted, the treaty would commit three dozen industrial countries to cut their greenhouse-gas emissions by 2012 at least 5 percent below the levels in 1990. So far, no industrial countries have ratified the pact.</p>
        <p>An accord, according to many delegates and scientists gathered here, could be a first tentative step away from an age built on combustion of fossil fuels, which has flooded the atmosphere with heat-trapping greenhouse gases, and toward economies that are more in balance with global ecology.</p>
        <p>Any success at all would inevitably be a result of big compromises on dozens of fronts, given the competing and contradictory situations of many countries taking part in the discussions.</p>
        <p>Cloistered in the Van Gogh Hall at the Netherlands Congress Center were representatives of tiny lowlying countries vulnerable to the rising seas expected in a warmer world; of some nations where crops might flourish in a warmer world and others whose crops could wilt; of countries cloaked in forests that can absorb carbon dioxide and help them cut emissions; and of nations whose fortunes derive from coal or oil, fuels that would lose favor and cost more should the treaty take force.</p>
        <p>As a result of this diversity, private environmental groups saw two possible outcomes. One would be a landmark success, in the form of effective, enforceable rules for cutting emissions of warming greenhouse gases. The other would be a wrenching failure, should the treaty lack clear language calling for strategies that cut emissions without creating other ecological trouble.</p>
        <p>Today, countries and alliances that had been giving daily news conferences canceled all such sessions, with the action moving into cubicles and offices. No one seemed satisfied with the latest treaty summary. Frank E. Loy, the chief American negotiator, communicated only with a printed statement, in which he said he was ''deeply disappointed'' with the document, but added that ''the situation is fluid'' and that negotiations would press ahead.</p>
        <p>And within the environmental movement, there were passionate divisions. Some people said the treaty, as proposed, failed to give credit for preserving tropical forests as a ''sink'' for carbon dioxide. Others objected to that idea, saying any credit for forest projects would take away the incentive for cutting the emissions causing the problem.</p>
        <p>Ms. Morgan said success would lie in the strength of the consensus and its power to motivate action now to start curtailing the human impact on the atmosphere. ''What we're looking for is a signal to businesses and countries that they need to start changing,'' Ms. Morgan said.</p>
        <p>In the end, the prospect of a climate treaty was creating unlikely alliances, with some businesses that had long been seen as enemies of the environment aligning themselves with conservation groups. Among those at the sessions calling for clear rules and strong penalties was Dale E. Heydlauff, senior vice president for environmental affairs of American Electric Power, a $12 billion-a-year energy company that has for decades wrestled with environmentalists over clean-air laws.</p>
        <p>''Environmental groups and industry both need strong, effective compliance mechanisms because otherwise this treaty is a fraud,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Tooker Gomberg, an environmental campaigner from Ontario, blasted a shrill note on a pocket trumpet in the press room, resulting in a stampede of television crews and reporters.</p>
        <p>He took out his passport and a cigarette lighter. ''Tonight I am ashamed to be Canadian,'' Mr. Gomberg said. ''My country is the worst country here at The Hague.''</p>
        <p>With a flick of his thumb, the passport blossomed into flames. ''Some people think this conference is an exercise in politics, diplomacy and compromise,'' he said. ''The only thing being compromised here is the integrity of the biosphere.''</p>
        <p>Eventually the halls grew quiet as aides and advisers retreated to hotels. They were useless until dawn, because their bosses were locked away with Mr. Pronk. One young man played a harmonica in a corner.</p>
