        <p>What will the weather be like in 2100?</p>
        <p>Don't laugh. While forecasting the next century in any field is a dicey exercise, climate experts have more tools than most prognosticators.</p>
        <p>Hence the widespread concern about global warming. Computer models enable climatologists to project the effects of the ever-increasing emissions of industrial gases, like carbon dioxide, that scientists contend are warming the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Of course, the picture that the models paint depends on the scientists' assumptions. A 1999 study by Dr. Tom Wigley, a climatologist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., ran four possiblities for the future thrugh climate models to examine how global temperature. Then he combined the results of 15 models to explore the effects on temperature and precipitation in North America.</p>
        <p>Presented below are projections for the year 2100 under two of Dr. Wigley's cases: those assuming the highest and lowest levels of emissions.</p>
        <p>A word of caution. Computers do not yet have the capacity to make more than relatively crude simulations of the climate's behavior, and scientists have not yet firmly pinned down the climate's sensitivity to warming by greenhouse gases. Dr. Wigley's analysis, conducted for the Pew Center on Global Climate Change in Arlington, Va., assumed a moderate sentivity of about 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit for a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>WILLIAM K. STEVENS</p>
        <p>The Highest-Emissions Future</p>
        <p>ASSUMPTIONS  * High population growth  * Relatively little emphasis on technological change  * No specific steps by governments to control greenhouse gas emissions</p>
        <p>GLOBAL CONDITIONS IN 2100  * Average surface temperature increase of about 5 degrees Fahrenheit increase of about 5 degrees Fahrenheit  * Sea level would rise about 2 feet</p>
        <p>The Lowest-Emissions Future</p>
        <p>ASSUMPTIONS  * Low population growth  * Emphasis on global action to reduce environmental problems, but no policy steps on greenhouse gas emissions specifically  * Rapid technological change  * Use of cleaner-energy technologies</p>
        <p>GLOBAL CONDITIONS IN 2100  * Temperature increase of about 3.5 degrees  * Sea level would rise aoubt 1.5 feet</p>
