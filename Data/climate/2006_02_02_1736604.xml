        <p>The energy proposals set out on Tuesday by President Bush quickly ran into obstacles on Wednesday, showing how difficult it will be to take even the limited steps he supports to reduce the nation's reliance on foreign oil.</p>
        <p>On the day after he declared in his State of the Union address that the United States was ''addicted to oil'' and had to wean itself from a century-old habit, Mr. Bush drew some support for putting the issue more prominently on the agenda but also skepticism about how achievable his goals really were.</p>
        <p>''Every administration since the early 1970's has struggled with the issue of rising oil imports and the right mix of policies to deal with them,'' said Daniel Yergin, the author of ''The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power'' and the founder of a consulting firm, Cambridge Energy Research Associates. ''Some people would just say, 'It's world trade, we sell Boeings and we buy oil.' But since oil is intertwined with geopolitics, people worry about vulnerability and whether oil is a drag on our foreign policy.''</p>
        <p>Diplomatically, Mr. Bush's ambitious call for the replacement of 75 percent of the United States' Mideast oil imports with ethanol and other energy sources by 2025 upset Saudi Arabia, the main American oil supplier in the Persian Gulf. In an interview on Wednesday, the Saudi ambassador to Washington, Prince Turki al-Faisal, said he would have to ask Mr. Bush's office ''what he exactly meant by that.''</p>
        <p>Politically, both parties on Capitol Hill displayed a lack of enthusiasm. Democrats said Mr. Bush had opposed foreign oil reduction targets in last year's energy bill, and Republicans questioned the practicality of relying on ethanol and other alternatives.</p>
        <p>Scientifically, researchers said ethanol and other alternative fuels were still years away from widespread commercial use.</p>
        <p>Economically, energy analysts said Mr. Bush's goal of reducing Mideast oil imports would have little practical benefit because oil was traded in world markets and its price was determined by global supply and demand, rather than bought from one country by another.</p>
        <p>''If the United States was zero-dependent on Middle Eastern oil, but the rest of our allies among consuming nations were just as dependent, then a disruption anywhere is a price increase everywhere,'' said Lawrence Goldstein, the president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, a policy analysis group in New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, like other modern presidents, has talked since the earliest days of his administration about weaning the United States off oil, but mostly by supporting an increase in domestic production. On Wednesday afternoon, Vice President Dick Cheney said on Rush Limbaugh's radio program that the administration would continue to push to open part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling.</p>
        <p>The difference on Tuesday was Mr. Bush's emphasis on alternative energy sources that he had not made a top focus in the past: better batteries for hybrid and electric cars, hydrogen cars, ethanol from wood and agricultural waste, solar and wind technologies and what he called ''clean, safe nuclear energy.''</p>
        <p>The president's tone was so changed, in fact, that some analysts said he sounded like a Democrat. Dan W. Reicher, who served in the Energy Department during the Clinton administration, said Mr. Bush's ideas showed ''an uncanny resemblance'' to some Clinton efforts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's main departure from many Democrats and another source of resistance to his energy plan is his opposition to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars. Mr. Bush has also opposed any effort to impose a higher gasoline tax.</p>
        <p>Many economists contend that a significant increase in the gasoline tax could lead to sharp changes in American behavior, because it would give consumers strong reasons to drive more efficient vehicles and give manufacturers incentives for innovative cars, including hybrids that run on gasoline and electricity.</p>
        <p>In 2004, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that a gasoline tax of 46 cents a gallon, up from today's federal tax of 18 cents, would reduce gasoline consumption by 10 percent over the next 14 years.</p>
        <p>But when asked why Mr. Bush had not called on the public to sacrifice to reduce oil consumption, Samuel W. Bodman, the energy secretary, said in a conference call with reporters on Wednesday that ''many Americans believe they're already sacrificing by paying the prices they're paying for gasoline and heating oil and natural gas.''</p>
        <p>Other analysts praised Mr. Bush's support for ethanol, but said that alternative fuels would not answer the administration's biggest fear about oil at the moment, the prospect that a confrontation with Iran over its nuclear program could disrupt the flow of oil from the Middle East.</p>
        <p>''The State of the Union address was good politics and good policy, but it doesn't address the most pressing problem,'' said J. Robinson West, an official in the Reagan administration and the chairman of PFC Energy, a consulting firm in Washington. ''The thing that they're really losing sleep about at the White House is the crude supply from Iran.''</p>
        <p>Specifically, the White House is worried that pressing Iran to give up its nuclear weapons ambitions could cause the Iranian government to retaliate by cutting off its oil supply to the world, as one economics minister in Iran threatened last week.</p>
        <p>The administration's more immediate international brushfire after the president's address was Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil supplie. Analysts said they were startled that Mr. Bush had singled out the Middle East with implicit criticism, and on the very day that the Saudis provided important support for American interests at a meeting in Vienna of ministers from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.</p>
        <p>At the meeting, Saudi Arabia blocked an effort by Venezuela and Iran to reduce the group's oil production.</p>
        <p>In Washington, Prince Turki, the Saudi ambassador, said he was puzzled by Mr. Bush's words in the speech. He said he wanted to know if reducing American dependence on foreign oil also applied to other suppliers to the United States. ''Is that a declaration that the U.S. is going to work to be independent of Canadian oil, Mexican oil and Venezuelan oil?'' he asked, adding, ''I see no threat from America from receiving its oil from the Middle East.''</p>
        <p>On Capitol Hill, Republicans praised the president's overall goals, but sounded notes of caution, with representatives of oil-producing states leading the way. Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, said he was enthusiastic about nuclear power but questioned whether the government should be subsidizing alternative fuels like ethanol.</p>
        <p>''It loses some of its shine when it becomes another government support program for an alternative fuel, which seems to be the pattern here in Washington,'' Mr. Cornyn said.</p>
        <p>Representative Joe L. Barton of Texas, the chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, even seemed to contradict the president's alarms about high energy prices. ''America runs on energy that is both abundant and available at prices we can afford to pay,'' Mr. Barton said in a statement.</p>
        <p>Energy analysts said the push on energy policy at the White House came in large part from Mr. Bodman, a former professor of chemical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as well as the former president of Fidelity Investments. Republicans said Mr. Bodman's push dovetailed with the view of Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's top political adviser, that high gas and home heating prices would be a potent political issue. Congress and the administration have at times sent conflicting signals about their priorities, further complicating Mr. Bush's prospects of pushing through his proposals.</p>
        <p>The Energy Department will begin laying off researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in the next week or two because of cuts to its budget.</p>
        <p>A veteran researcher said the staff had been told that the cuts would be concentrated among researchers in wind and biomass, which includes ethanol. Those are two of the technologies that Mr. Bush cited on Tuesday night as holding the promise to replace part of the nation's oil imports.</p>
        <p>The budget for the laboratory, which is just west of Denver, was cut by nearly 15 percent, to $174 million from $202 million, requiring the layoff of about 40 staff members out of a total of 930, said a spokesman, George Douglas. The cut is for the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1.</p>
