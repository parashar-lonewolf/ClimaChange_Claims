        <p>Wading into one of the nation's most contentious environmental debates, Vice President Al Gore pledged today to prohibit logging and road building on 43 million acres of undeveloped national forests.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's promise goes beyond a proposal the Clinton administration made just three weeks ago that would bar road building across that same broad swath of roadless land in 155 national forests and grasslands. That land accounts for about a quarter of the entire forest system and includes many of its most pristine areas.</p>
        <p>But even as they praised President  Clinton's proposal, many environmental groups said it did not go far enough because it would not prevent logging in those undeveloped forest lands. Environmentalists also criticized the plan, which is under review, for explicitly exempting the Tongass National Forest in Alaska, the nation's largest.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Gore addressed both complaints, saying he would bar logging as well as road building in the roadless areas. And he strongly suggested that he would extend the same protections to the Tongass, where conservation efforts have been opposed by Alaska's influential Congressional delegation.</p>
        <p>''If I am entrusted with the presidency, it will be a national priority to preserve these roadless areas as they are, no ifs, ands or buts about it,'' Mr. Gore said. ''No more destructive development and exploitation. And just so I'm crystal clear about it, no new road building and no timber sales in the roadless areas of our national forests. Period.''</p>
        <p>On the Tongass, Mr. Gore added, ''I will ensure total and permanent protection for the roadless areas in the Tongass, America's great temperate rain forest.''</p>
        <p>The vice president made his announcement after picking up the endorsement of the League of Conservation Voters, which represents the leadership of more than 40 environmental groups.</p>
        <p>''His environmental achievements are the most extensive of any public official in high office,'' said Deb Callahan, president of the league. ''Without Al Gore and this administration, we would already be experiencing a dramatic backward slide on the environment.''</p>
        <p>Beyond its new environmental promises, Mr. Gore's speech was notable for not mentioning Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, his Republican rival. The vice president has been criticized by some fellow Democrats for spending too much time in recent weeks attacking Mr. Bush rather than explaining where he would lead the country.</p>
        <p>Today's speech, Mr. Gore's aides said, was just the first of several in which he plans to focus on his own proposals and vision, rather than reacting to news that his opponent creates. The vice president has also begun devoting more of his speeches to spotlighting parts of his background, a strategy the Democratic National Committee plans to incorporate into a series of biographical television commercials in the coming weeks.</p>
        <p>But if Mr. Gore gave his Republican opponent a pass today, Ms. Callahan, who worked on Mr. Gore's 1988 presidential campaign, did not. She asserted that Mr. Bush had done little to reduce air pollution or improve state parks in Texas. And she accused Mr. Bush of pandering to big corporate polluters that have contributed generously to his campaigns.</p>
        <p>''George W. Bush's appointees to key cabinet and administrative positions predict an administration of, by and for the special interests,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, said Mr. Bush's administration had actually added nearly 91,000 acres to the state park system and had significantly reduced the release of toxic pollutants into the air, water and soil.</p>
        <p>''When Al Gore chooses surrogates to pollute Governor Bush's record, he should choose ones that have their facts straight,'' Mr. Bartlett said. ''The new Al Gore is the same old Al Gore. The negative campaigning will continue.''</p>
        <p>To counter the league's endorsement, the Republican National Committee circulated today copies of a memorandum written at least six months ago by a board member of the Sierra Club, one of the nation's largest and most influential environmental groups, that sharply criticized Mr. Gore's environmental record.</p>
        <p>''With this legacy, no real environmentalist could ever endorse Al Gore,'' wrote Michael Dorsey, a doctoral candidate at the University of Michigan school of natural resources and environment.</p>
        <p>But Daniel J. Weiss, the Sierra Club's political director, described the memorandum as ''one person's opinion,'' adding that it would have ''no impact'' on whether the group endorsed Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Many environmentalists expect the Sierra Club to back Mr. Gore by the fall. Indeed, the group has already spent $250,000 on television commercials attacking Mr. Bush's environmental record. The spots are being broadcast in Michigan, Missouri and Wisconsin and will begin running in Ohio this week.</p>
        <p>A third, smaller environmental group, Friends of the Earth, which endorsed Bill Bradley in the Democratic primaries and has been sharply critical of Mr. Gore's record on global warming and trade issues, remains undecided in the race. A spokesman, Mark Whiteis-Helm, said the group is considering endorsing Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, but has not ruled out backing Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>In proposing new protections for the national forests, Mr. Gore stepped into an emerging national debate over development in some of the nation's wildest lands.</p>
        <p>Advocates of the expanded protections contend that roadless areas encompass some of the cleanest, safest wildlife habitats in the nation. But off-road vehicle enthusiasts and timber industry officials argue that too much public land has already been placed off limits to development. The ban has also been strongly opposed by some powerful Western lawmakers who say it would reduce logging jobs.</p>
        <p>Forest Service officials have said that simply banning road building would significantly reduce future logging in the roadless areas. But Mr. Gore sided today with environmentalists, who contend that unless logging is specifically prohibited, helicopter logging and other activities could damage the land.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore did not consult with Mr. Clinton about today's speech, advisers to the vice president said. But aides to the two men did confer beforehand.</p>
        <p>In his speech today, Mr. Gore also pledged to prevent oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. And he asserted that passing campaign finance reform legislation would be a form of environmental protection, because it would reduce the influence of big corporate polluters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore also defended his 1992 book on the environment, ''Earth in the Balance,'' which was recently reissued, much to the glee of some Republicans who say it exposed Mr. Gore as an extremist on the issue. But today, Mr. Gore said: ''I am proud I wrote that book. I stand by every word in that book.''</p>
        <p>He concluded: ''I believe that God created only this one earth and the earth is in the balance. Save it we can, and save it we must.''</p>
