        <p>INTERNATIONAL A3-12</p>
        <p>Israel Bombards Lebanon After Hezbollah Hits Haifa  The Lebanese militia Hezbollah unleashed its deadliest missile yet on Israel, killing eight people in the city of Haifa. Israeli warplanes struck targets in southern Beirut and southern Lebanon, killing 45 people and wounding more than 100, according to local reports. The impact of the deaths on both sides and the missile strike marked a qualitative and psychological escalation of the conflict on its fifth day.  A1</p>
        <p>The Lebanese militia Hezbollah fired 10 powerful rockets -- a kind it has never unleashed before -- which traveled more than 20 miles over northern Israel before slamming down in Haifa. The attack confirmed what Israeli security chiefs have warned for years: that Hezbollah has large, powerful rockets able to reach major Israeli cities.  A8</p>
        <p>Arabs Publicly Blame Hezbollah  Arab governments are taking the rare step of publicly blaming Hezbollah. Saudi Arabia, supported by Jordan, Egypt, several Gulf states and the Palestinian Authority, chastised Hezbollah for ''unexpected, inappropriate and irresponsible acts'' at an emergency Arab League summit meeting in Cairo.  A1</p>
        <p>Tacit U.S. Approval for Israel  The Bush administration appeared to give Israel tacit approval to cripple Hezbollah, casting the conflict in the Middle East in terms of a wider war on terrorism. That was a central theme of both public and private statements from senior American officials, even as President Bush and his aides issued a statement including a request for restraint in Israel's attacks on Lebanon.  A10</p>
        <p>Group of 8 Focuses on Oil  The world leaders at a Group of 8 summit meeting issued a communiqué on energy policy that touched lightly on alternatives to fossil fuels, like biomass and wind power, but focused mostly on how to bring more oil to the market.  A11</p>
        <p>Sunnis Shift View of U.S. in Iraq  As sectarian violence soars, many Sunni Arab political and religious leaders once staunchly opposed to the American presence in Iraq are now saying they need American troops to protect them from the rampages of Shiite militias and Shiite-run government forces.  A1</p>
        <p>Iraqi Officials' Safety Shaken  Gunmen in vehicles resembling those used by Iraqi security forces kidnapped Adil Mohamed al-Qazaz, president of one of Iraq's state-owned oil companies in Baghdad, an Oil Ministry spokesman said. The abduction underscored the danger that high-level Iraqi officials face and the power of criminal groups who strike at them seemingly at will.  A12</p>
        <p>2nd Mexican Recount Protest  For the second time in a little over a week, thousands of supporters of the leftist presidential candidate, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, filled Mexico City's central plaza to demonstrate their support for his demand for a recount in the disputed election.  A3</p>
        <p>NATIONAL A13-15</p>
        <p>Hospitals and Vendors Are Under Scrutiny  While the financial relationship between doctors and drug companies has come under intense scrutiny, much less is known about how hospital executives interact with companies that sell them drugs, medical equipment and financial services.  A1</p>
        <p>Aid Arrives for Gulf Coast  Nearly $10 billion in federal aid is starting to flow into the hands of people in Mississippi and Louisiana who lost their houses in last year's hurricanes, the culmination of a year of political battling and bargaining between the states and Washington.  A1</p>
        <p>A Reward for Arizona Voters  A proposal to award $1 million in every general election to one lucky Arizona resident simply for voting -- no matter for whom -- has qualified for the November ballot. Mark Osterloh, left, a political gadfly who is behind the initiative, is promoting it with the slogan ''Who wants to be a Millionaire? Vote!''  A1</p>
        <p>Plan Cuts Medicare Payments  The Bush administration says it plans sweeping changes in Medicare payments to hospitals that could cut payments by 20 percent to 30 percent for many complex treatments and new technologies. The changes, the biggest since the current payment system was adopted in 1983, are meant to improve the accuracy of payment rates.  A13</p>
        <p>SCIENCE/HEALTH</p>
        <p>A Diabetes- Alzheimer's Link?  Several new studies suggest that diabetes increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease, adding to a store of evidence that links the disorders. The studies involve only Type 2 diabetes, the most common type, which is usually related to obesity.  A15</p>
        <p>Discovery Gets the All-Clear  The space shuttle Discovery is coming home, buoyed by positive tests and inspections indicating the spacecraft is in good shape for a landing in Florida following a 13-day mission to the International Space Station.  A13</p>
        <p>OBITUARIES B7</p>
        <p>Winthrop Paul Rockefeller  A lieutenant governor of Arkansas who followed his family's twin traditions of philanthropy and politics in the state adopted by his father, he was 57.  B7</p>
        <p>Dr. James A. Nicholas  A pioneer in the treatment of athletic injuries who was best known for performing four knee operations that saved the celebrated career of the Jets quarterback Joe Namath, he was 85.  B7</p>
        <p>Carrie Nye  A stage, film and television actress and a fixture at the Williamstown Theater Festival, she was 69.  B7</p>
        <p>NEW YORK/REGION B1-6</p>
        <p>Bloomberg Commission Addresses Poverty in City  Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's Commission on Economic Opportunity has been focused on how to solve the problem of rising poverty in a city as wealthy as New York. They found that the solution is employment, and rather than pumping benefits into households, they want the government to use more of its resources to allow people to enter the work force -- and stay in it.  B1</p>
        <p>Church Divided Over Gays  Though All Angels Church in New York City is a theologically conservative branch of the Episcopal Church, it serves a liberal diocese. But the church has joined the national battle over the promotion of a gay bishop, and this month will take a major step toward cleaving itself from the denomination by formally joining the Anglican Communion Network.  B1</p>
        <p>WNYC Relocating Next Year  After broadcasting for the last 82 years from the Municipal Building in Manhattan, WNYC, which has the largest audience of any public radio station in the United States, is moving. No longer will its 18 journalists be jammed into a shoebox of a newsroom, and guests will wait in an actual green room, not out in the hall at the water cooler.  B1</p>
        <p>Program for Disabled Ailing  New York State has prevented thousands of disabled people from receiving walkers and wheelchairs by delaying or denying their requests in violation of state and federal rules, according to an investigation by the State Assembly.  B5</p>
        <p>SPORTSMONDAY D1-8</p>
        <p>400th Save for Rivera  Mariano Rivera, left, of the Yankees, earned the 400th save of his career in a pressurized 6-4 victory over the Chicago White Sox . The play concluded what may have been the team's best weekend of the season and it came against the defending World Series champions before 54,781 fans at Yankee Stadium.  D1</p>
        <p>Injuries on Tour de France  Two riders in the Tour de France, a Belgian cyclist with the French Cofidis team and a Spaniard on the Saunier Duval-Prodir team, ended their tours with a visit to the hospital after violent falls some 25 miles from the end of the stage, which was won by Pierrick Fedrigo.  D1</p>
        <p>ARTS E1-8</p>
        <p>Long-Term 'Talent' at NBC  ''America's Got Talent,'' the singing, dancing, juggling and ventriloquizing new reality talent competition, has posted solid ratings in each of its four outings on NBC this summer. But the numbers, while strong, have been just tenuous enough to leave some doubt about whether it can break through as a genuine hit in the regular season.  E1</p>
        <p>BUSINESS DAY C1-12</p>
        <p>Airbus Plans New Project  Airbus, desperate to pull out of the worst downturn in its history, plans to disclose details of a radically redesigned midsize plane, a $10 billion project that will compete with Boeing's 787, executives said.  C1</p>
        <p>Backdating Option Grants  More than 2,000 companies appear to have used backdated stock options to sweeten their chief executives' pay packages, according to a new study that suggests the practice is far more widespread than previously disclosed.  C1</p>
        <p>Disney Alters Movie Division  Walt Disney Studios will soon announce a major reorganization of its live-action movie division, which will alter the way Disney movies are made and marketed, according to several people briefed on the plan.  C3</p>
        <p>New Technology from H.P.  Researchers at Hewlett-Packard are set to introduce a new technology that they say will allow large amounts of information to be stored on tiny chips attached to objects. The stored information might include video, sound and text.  C8</p>
