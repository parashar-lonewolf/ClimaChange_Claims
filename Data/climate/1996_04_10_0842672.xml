        <p>The fight against bad English is not frivolous," George Orwell wrote in 1946  -- a conviction that has grown ever truer in the intervening half century. Today, a muddled thought or phrase can send the whole globe marching down a cul  de sac. This is why Earth Day, April 22, should be spent with dictionaries and thesauruses.</p>
        <p>For nearly a decade, environmentalists have tried to introduce a catchword into the planetary vocabulary. "Sustainability" made its debut in the mid-1980's in United Nations documents, and today it is standard jargon in certain circles. Think tanks and policy analysts use it constantly; just last month, President Clinton's Council on Sustainable Development issued its report, "Sustainable America."</p>
        <p>But the phrase has never made the leap to lingo -- and never will. It's time to figure out why, and then figure out something else.</p>
        <p>"Sustainability" was born partly in an effort to obfuscate, to paper over the tension between the fact that societies are overexploiting the planet's physical resources and the fact that everyone seems reluctant to stop this rapaciousness. Hence, phrases like "sustainable development" and "sustainable growth" are used  when the real intent is to put off the day of reckoning for a few more decades.</p>
        <p>The President's Council, whose report is powerful in many ways, could not even bring itself to call for less use of energy, only for less use of energy "per unit of industrial output" (say, one less barrel of oil in making each widget while producing ever more widgets).</p>
        <p>It's no wonder we want to avoid choosing between economic growth -- between an expanding, interdependent world economy -- and a healthy environment. Helping economies in poor countries grow might reduce some of the environmental damage that comes of desperation; it allows rich countries to alleviate certain kinds of pollution with advanced technology.</p>
        <p>But the largest environmental problems -- global warming, destruction of habitat -- are essentially caused by economic and population growth, not by faulty technology.</p>
        <p>To deal with such troubles in the next few decades, the world will need not only bicycles and energy-efficient mass transport, it will need a new way of thinking. Our societies will have to voluntarily stabilize, if not reduce, the size of their economies and populations. "Sustainability," which Orwell would have disdained, is no help in this situation. In competition with "growth," "sustainability" is doomed, because it  does not refer to anything familiar. We understand "growth," because everything  that lives grows.</p>
        <p>But we do something else, too, if we are lucky. We mature. We stop growing physically, and we start concentrating on moral, spiritual and cultural development. And so "maturity" just might be the right new buzzword. People can  imagine mature societies, civilizations, perhaps even economies, even though we  may not know yet how to achieve them.</p>
        <p>The transition to a world of tighter limits -- by choice now, or necessity later -- would be wrenching. But at least the term fits our frame of reference.</p>
        <p>Maturing means restraining oneself -- precisely what environmentalists contend our species must do. Maturity means, at bottom, recognizing that you are not the center of the world but part of something larger. And that is just the point that the ailing planet wants everyone to grasp.</p>
