        <p>SIX years ago in the Washington Monthly, Malcolm Gladwell faced off against Adam Gopnik, his fellow New Yorker writer, in a debate over Canada's single-payer health care system. Mr. Gopnik favored it; Mr. Gladwell opposed it vigorously. ''Canada has achieved a wonderful thing, which is universal health care coverage,'' he said then. ''But it has achieved it at a price, and that is quality of care.''</p>
        <p>On the blog he started last week (gladwell.typepad.com), Mr. Gladwell noted that the blogosphere has, for some mysterious reason, picked up on the debate. ''But wait!'' he wrote.

        <p>SIX years ago in the Washington Monthly, Malcolm Gladwell faced off against Adam Gopnik, his fellow New Yorker writer, in a debate over Canada's single-payer health care system. Mr. Gopnik favored it; Mr. Gladwell opposed it vigorously. ''Canada has achieved a wonderful thing, which is universal health care coverage,'' he said then. ''But it has achieved it at a price, and that is quality of care.''</p>
        <p>On the blog he started last week (gladwell.typepad.com), Mr. Gladwell noted that the blogosphere has, for some mysterious reason, picked up on the debate. ''But wait!'' he wrote. ''That was six years ago! I've now changed my mind. I now agree with virtually everything Adam said and disagree with virtually everything I said. In fact, I shudder when I read what I said back then.''</p>
        <p>In 2000, Mr. Gladwell recalled a bicycle accident he had at 16 in Ontario. ''I ran off the road and I basically impaled my eye on a stick,'' he says. It took 9 days and a 120-mile trip to Toronto for him to get a CAT scan. The doctor declared that he ''clearly suffered irreversible brain damage.'' His recovery, he said, was due more to luck than to the care he received.</p>
        <p>In the United States then, CAT scan equipment proliferated. In Canada, it was rare. The United States is where medical discoveries are made. Countries like Canada don't make discoveries, they only benefit from those made in the United States. So argued Mr. Gladwell in 2000.</p>
        <p>And now? By 2005, in a New Yorker article, Mr. Gladwell was arguing for health care reform with a vehemence he did not exhibit when he was on the other side of the question. One of the ''great mysteries of political life in the United States is why Americans are so devoted'' to a health care system ''of increasing complexity and dysfunction,'' he wrote.</p>
        <p>Why the change? ''I woke up one day,'' he wrote in his blog, ''and realized what much smarter people than me (Adam Gopnik) realized a long time ago, which is that the idea of employer-based health care is just plain stupid. And only our familiarity with it and sheer inertia prevent us from rising up in rebellion.''</p>
        <p>ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS -- Here's something to chew on as you head to work on Monday: ''Everything the economic system produces ultimately returns to the ecosystem as waste.''</p>
        <p>That idea, which puts increases in productivity into new prospective, comes from Joshua Farley, an ''ecological economist'' who was interviewed this week on WorldChanging.com.</p>
        <p>As the interview makes clear, ecological economics is as complex as the phenomena it studies. But as the name hints, it puts heavy emphasis on sustainability, and it introduces factors into economic analysis that traditionalists generally ignore -- to the peril of all of us, according to Mr. Farley.</p>
        <p>''The dominant economic paradigm strives for ever-increasing economic growth,'' he says. ''Not only is this impossible on a finite planet, but growing evidence suggests that beyond a certain point, more material consumption does nothing to make us better off.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Farley says that resource scarcity lies at the heart of his discipline. ''Some of the most important issues we face today are climate change, biodiversity loss, ozone depletion and other environmental problems that are completely ignored by market forces. Our economic system has to evolve to respond to these new scarcities.''</p>
        <p>IS IT REAL, OR IS IT  -- Sometimes, life imitates parody. National Lampoon came up with the mock heavy metal group Megadeath a good decade before the real band Megadeth was formed in 1983. ''Saturday Night Live'' ran a commercial spoof for the ''Triple-Trac'' razor 23 years before Gillette introduced the Mach 3.</p>
        <p>This week, a video that depicts what it might be like if Microsoft had designed the packaging for Apple's iPod made heavy rotation online. Then, Microsoft posted a promotional video for its coming mysterious portable product, Origami, that in some ways resembles the parody. So in this case, it's life imitating parody imitating life.</p>
