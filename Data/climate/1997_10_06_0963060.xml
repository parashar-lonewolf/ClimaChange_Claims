        <p>Editorial Notebook comment by Robert B Semple Jr says Pres Clinton can turn increasingly polarized argument about global warming to his advantage by positioning himself as moderate in American proposal he presents to industrialized nations meeting in Kyoto, Japan, in December to negotiate treaty controlling emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases; says in addition to Clinton's stated principles, one element he has not talked about is emissions-trading scheme in which rich nations would 'buy' pollution permits from poorer countries (M)</p>

        <p>The debate over global warming has taken on all the characteristics of a political brawl, complete with spin doctors and aggressive advertising.

        <p>The debate over global warming has taken on all the characteristics of a political brawl, complete with spin doctors and aggressive advertising. A badly confused public is told one day that only a quick and dramatic reduction in energy use can avert meteorological disaster, then warned the next that any such prescription would send energy prices through the roof and the economy through the floor.</p>
        <p>If he is smart about it, President Clinton can turn this increasingly polarized argument to his advantage. Most Americans are at least vaguely aware that rising atmospheric temperatures pose real if remote threats. They are also eager to know whether there are ways to address that threat that are both effective and affordable. It is here that Mr. Clinton can make a difference, positioning himself as a moderate in a debate that has so far shed more heat than light.</p>
        <p>Between now and December, when the industrialized nations will meet in Kyoto, Japan, to negotiate  a treaty controlling emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, Mr. Clinton must devise a specific American proposal. He has already committed himself to ''realistic and binding'' limits on carbon emissions, but has not said what these targets should be and how to reach them. He is unlikely to be any more specific today in his remarks to a White House conference on global warming, a gathering aimed mainly at sharpening public awareness of the issue. But he has already sketched out four principles that will guide his Kyoto proposals.</p>
        <p>First, he believes, along with most mainstream scientists, that man-made gases produced by the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil are contributing  to warming and that unless these gases are reduced,  bad things -- coastal flooding and widespread droughts -- are likely to occur late in the 21st century. Second,  he believes that no global emissions-control system  can succeed without the leadership of the United States, which produces one-fifth of the world's greenhouse  gases with only 5 percent of the world's population.</p>
        <p>Third, he is convinced that developing countries like India and China, which are projected to throw off huge greenhouse emissions, must be part of any global warming agreement -- if not right away, then soon. This is a contentious subject. The Europeans argue that these countries need more time to grow and cannot now be forced into an international regime. The Senate, however, has said that it will not ratify a treaty that does not bind developing countries to enforceable targets.</p>
        <p>Fourth, Mr. Clinton wants a system that will not impose intolerable strain on the American economy. He has already rejected as disingenuous (and much too expensive) a European proposal to reduce emissions 15 percent below 1990 levels by 2010. He clearly prefers a more gradual approach, and seems also to have ruled out new gasoline or carbon taxes (neither of which would fly in Congress anyway) and strong new regulations. His preferred approach is to set firm national limits on emissions and then let individual industries meet those targets using the cheapest means possible, either by switching to cleaner fuels or by making far more efficient use of energy.</p>
        <p>There is one other element to Mr. Clinton's strategy that he has not talked about, but which may well be his ace in the hole in Kyoto as he tries to draw developing countries into the mix while providing flexibility for American industries. Devised by the Environmental Defense Fund, this is an emissions-trading scheme in which rich nations that cannot meet their assigned targets without crippling taxes or investments would be able to ''buy'' pollution permits from poorer countries whose economies are so inefficient that even the tiniest adjustments can achieve big reductions in greenhouse emissions. That money, in turn, would help developing countries invest in cleaner technologies.</p>
        <p>This may not satisfy the Europeans, who find  Mr. Clinton's faith in technology and efficiency touching but unrealistic, or those economists who believe that anything short of a stiff tax on carbon-based fuels will not get the job done. But Mr. Clinton has two constituencies, one in Kyoto and the other in the Senate. If he means to win over both, a modest course may be his only course.</p>
