        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As the inventors of superconducting magnetically levitated trains and holders of the original 1968 patent, we wish to comment on "Doubts About Magnetic Train Mount" (letter, Dec. 3) by Marjorie and James Young. Our published designs have formed the basis for the levitation and propulsion systems in the Japanese superconducting maglev project the Youngs discuss, as acknowledged by its developers.</p>
        <p>The Youngs state that maglev consumes at least three times as much energy per passenger mile as Japan's bullet high-speed rail train. However, their comparisons reflect totally different conditions. The Japanese maglev trains will travel at 300 miles per hour in tunnels where air drag effects are large, while the bullet trains travel at 140 m.p.h. in the open air. Sixty percent of the proposed Tokyo-Osaka maglev route is in tunnels because of the mountainous terrain. This new route represents a social decision by the Japanese to open previously undeveloped portions of their crowded country.</p>
        <p>When traveling under similar conditions -- at the same speed and both in tunnels or both in open air -- maglev passengers use much less energy per passenger mile than high-speed rail passengers. This is because maglev vehicles are much lighter than high-speed rail trains, and there is no mechanical friction with the track.</p>
        <p>The Youngs also do not compare maglev with auto and air travel. Maglev at 300 m.p.h. uses half the primary thermal energy per passenger mile that 60 m.p.h. autos do, and only a quarter of that used by airplanes. United States transport energy use would be considerably reduced by shifting to maglev. Moreover, maglev does not use oil fuel, but electricity from clean coal, hydro, solar or nuclear power.</p>
        <p>The Youngs are wrong in stating that maglev cannot carry freight. Maglev could readily and economically transport most of the United States truck-type freight, in addition to passengers. Maglev forces are distributed over a large area on the guideway, and there is no mechanical contact; thus maintenance requirements are very low, even if freight is carried. In contrast, carrying freight on high-speed rail trains would quickly wear out and destroy the precisely positioned tracks from the constant heavy pounding. Even carrying passengers, high-speed rail tracks require a large maintenance force.</p>
        <p>As for the health effects of magnetic fields, maglev can be designed so that passengers experience a constant magnetic field of the same strength -- about 1/2 gauss -- as all life forms evolved in and are exposed to on earth. Passengers in electrified rail trains typically experience strong magnetic fields that alternate at power-line frequencies. Such alternating fields are of potentially much greater concern.</p>
        <p>Maglev, if it is implemented, will have enormous environmental, safety and economic benefits. It can greatly reduce pollution and carbon dioxide emissions, provide greater and safer mobility at lower cost, and reduce dependence on foreign oil. If we are to improve our environment and living standards, we must bring forward new technologies to solve our crisis problems. JAMES R. POWELL GORDON T. DANBY Shoreham, L.I., Dec. 12, 1990 The writers are with Brookhaven National Laboratory as, respectively, head of the reaction systems division and a senior physicist.</p>
