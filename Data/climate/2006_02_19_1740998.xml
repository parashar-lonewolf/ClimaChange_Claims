        <p>IF ever there was a year that Connecticut's maple syrup makers were sweating it, this would be the one.</p>
        <p>Literally.</p>
        <p>Through most of January, uncommonly warm temperatures that approximated the perfect maple sugaring conditions traditionally found from late February through March, had syrup makers facing a conundrum: to tap or not to tap early. Additionally, they faced the prospect that whatever choice they made, the result would still be a lousy syrup crop, and perhaps more ominously for this $600,000 a year business, that these conditions could extend into the future.</p>
        <p>''The biggest problem is you have to try to outguess Mother Nature,'' said Randall King Sr. of Mik-Ran's Sugarhouse in Brooklyn, among the larger of Connecticut's about 350 maple syrup makers.</p>
        <p>Not easy after a January in which daytime high temperatures not only ran above normal 23 out of 31 days, but also cracked 60 twice and averaged in the low 40's instead of just above freezing, which would have been typical. Lows ran above the normal 17 to 18 degrees on 26 nights.</p>
        <p>Temperature is key to making maple syrup. For optimum sap flow in a sugar maple, nighttime temperatures should be below freezing, ideally no higher than the mid-20's, followed by daytime temperatures in the mid-to- high 40's.</p>
        <p>The daytime rising temperature allows gas bubbles within the cells of sugar maple wood to expand, creating pressure and forcing out the tree's sap, which is water with sugar in it. At night when the temperature goes down and the tree refreezes, the gas bubbles shrink, the tree pulls more liquid from the soil, and the whole process starts again. To keep sap flowing, the tree needs that recharging every few days.</p>
        <p>If the weather is too cold, sap will not flow. If the weather stays warm, sap will push out, but it will not last long. All of which assumes that there is a tap hole in the tree for the sap to flow through.</p>
        <p>And that is the tricky part: picking the right time to poke that hole.</p>
        <p>''The danger of tapping too early is that it gets cold for a prolonged period of time and the tap hole will dry out, so when normal conditions return you wouldn't get as much sap,'' said Dr. Timothy Perkins, director of the University of Vermont's Proctor Maple Research Center, considered by the industry to be the premiere maple research institution in the United States.</p>
        <p>He said that if it stays warm like it was in January and the trees are tapped early, ''you'd miss some of the early runs.''</p>
        <p>The clock starts ticking the second that tap hole is bored. Like any wound, it immediately begins to heal. In the case of a sugar maple, that takes about six weeks, less if the weather is warm. It is generally not advisable to bore a second hole in a tree, although syrup makers will sometimes re-bore a tap hole later in the season.</p>
        <p>Maple syrup -- a fundamentally simple product -- is made by boiling sap until its sugar content reaches 66 to 67 percent, and then filtering it. Sap is commonly 2 percent sugar, which means it takes 40 to 43 gallons to make one gallon of syrup. If sap is only 1 percent sugar, it will take 80 to 86 gallons to make a gallon of syrup. In a normal year, when sugaring season begins after a proper freeze, sugar content in sap can be as high as 4 percent early in the run. That syrup, because it requires less boiling, becomes the premium, most delicate and expensive syrup: the light amber.</p>
        <p>This year, the lack of a January freeze could mean sugar content will be low, and indeed reports from early taps have borne that out. That likely means a darker and lower-priced syrup, and less of it.</p>
        <p>All of which explains why so many syrup makers were agonizing over when to tap.</p>
        <p>''This is the most confusing year I've ever seen,'' said Rob Lamothe of Lamothe's Sugar House, the largest syrup maker in the state with about 4,300 taps in Burlington and New Hartford. After consulting his five National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's weather radios, including one in his bathroom, and hand-wringing through most of January while a neighboring sugar maker was making syrup, he gave into his apprehensions and began tapping himself on Jan. 30, his earliest date ever.</p>
        <p>He made his first batch of syrup on Feb. 2, also his earliest ever. And by Feb. 4, all his trees were tapped. On Feb. 6, the temperature went below freezing, and not only stayed close to that point for the next 10 days, but also was punctuated by last Sunday's massive snowstorm, offering little hope of sap while his tap holes began their march toward sealing.</p>
        <p>''I held out as long as I could,'' said Mr. Lamothe, who has been in the business for 35 years. ''Whatever happens, happens. We could be making a big mistake.''</p>
        <p>Bill Proulx, owner of River's Edge Sugar House in Ashford, the second-largest producer in the state, took a more Zen approach. On a sunny Groundhog Day that tickled the 50-degree mark and was punctuated by chirping birds outside his sugar house, he vowed to hold out until at least the middle of the month.</p>
        <p>''It's out of my control, and I'm not going to get an ulcer over it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''It reminds me of stocks, when should you buy?'' he added. ''I'm still thinking that if you tap this early, we're going to get to the second week in March and the temperature is going be good and we're going say: 'The holes are sealing up. We should have waited.' So I'm gambling on that.''</p>
        <p>Stephen Broderick, a forester for the University of Connecticut Extension Service, who aside from dealing with trees for a living is also a syrup maker, said he couldn't remember a winter like this. He recommended that syrup makers ignore the weather forecasts. Stick with the mean daily temperature averages, Mr. Broderick said, and tap the second or third week in February, regardless of the weather.</p>
        <p>''If you have a six-week window, my contention is if you place that window over the typical period for sugaring, you will do better over 10 or 15 years than when you consistently jump the gun,'' Mr. Broderick said, though he, too, is concerned about low sugar content this year.</p>
        <p>''Having made syrup annually for 20 years and been attached to it practically all my life, I am hard pressed to remember a typical season,'' he said. ''There is always some fluke in the works.''</p>
        <p>The most common fluke in recent years has been warmer temperatures, according to data gathered by Dr. Perkins for a study of how such a climate change might have an impact on maple trees. Many people attribute the change to global warming, but Dr. Perkins wouldn't go that far.</p>
        <p>''Although I personally believe global climate change is occurring, it is not possible to say that what we are seeing now is a result of global warming,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Assuming the warming trend continues, Dr. Perkins said there was research that predicted that in several hundred years, the maple/beech/birch forests of New England will have migrated north, replaced by oak and pine. And that would mean no maple syrup at all in what are now the southern edges of those forests.</p>
        <p>In 2005, the fluke was sustained colder than usual temperatures in February, which caused most sugar makers to tap late. That was followed by a sudden and sustained extreme warm-up, which shortened the sap run. While the syrup quality was extraordinarily good, national production was down 18 percent, although Connecticut only suffered a 9 percent drop, because, in part, of sugar makers who had made early January runs.</p>
        <p>Connecticut is not a major syrup producer. Among the 10 main syrup-producing states, Connecticut ranks last with 1 percent of the national production, about 10,000 gallons in 2005, valued at barely $600,000 out of a total national product of $42.8 million in 2004, the latest year numbers were available. That is only the syrup, not revenue produced by tourism the sugar houses bring in and the other products many of them sell. Vermont is the first-place powerhouse with about a third of the total syrup. Maine and New York each produce about a fifth.</p>
        <p>But Connecticut ranks first in two critical categories. Eighty-five percent of its product is sold retail, usually at the sugar houses or a small specialty shops, as opposed to wholesale or bulk, substantially higher than any other state. Vermont, by comparison, sells only about 30 percent of its product retail.</p>
        <p>And Connecticut retail prices are the highest, with the average gallon selling for just under $40, though an informal check found many prices at $50 a gallon. The high price is a simple case of supply and demand, according to Ron Wenzel, president of the Maple Syrup Producers Association of Connecticut. The state doesn't produce that much syrup and, he said, ''we have a lot of people.''</p>
        <p>Syrup makers, who raised prices last year when production was low, said they would try not to raise prices again, putting an item already in the luxury category further out of reach for many people who are just trying to sweeten their pancakes.</p>
        <p>''That's the last thing I want to do,'' Mr. Lamothe said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Proulx agreed.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to have people buying Aunt Jemima.''</p>
