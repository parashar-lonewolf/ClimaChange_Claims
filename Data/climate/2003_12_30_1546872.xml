        <p>All Squawk Together Now</p>
        <p>In a family, children often learn that collaboration is one way to get what they want. One child asking for the umpteenth time to have pizza for dinner may be little more than an irritant to a parent, but when two or three all plead in concert, the parent may give in.</p>
        <p>What works in human families appears to work with gulls, too. Canadian and French researchers have found that adult black-headed gulls respond more often when two or more of their chicks beg for food together than when one chick goes it alone. This means less effort for each chick, and they wise up rather quickly: the more offspring there are, the researchers say, the more they coordinate their begging.</p>
        <p>The researchers, who described their work in The Proceedings of the Royal Society: Biology Letters, observed nests with up to three chicks at a pond near St. Etienne in central France. They noted the intensity of begging behavior (approaching the parents, hunching over, stimulating the parents' beaks and calling) and the parents' response (regurgitating food).</p>
        <p>Chicks begged more often and more intensively when they were the only offspring than when they had siblings, but the solo begging was far less effective. Parents responded about one time in five to a solo chick, but five times in six to two chicks begging together. And when three chicks were in the nest and they all begged in concert, the parents gave them food every time.</p>
        <p>An earlier study of tree swallows had the opposite result, showing that individual begging intensity increases with number of offspring. This makes more sense intuitively: when there's competition, after all, it should be the squeaky bird that gets the food. But the latest study shows that among gulls, at least, coordination can get the offspring what they want.</p>
        <p>No Picnic for Cod</p>
        <p>By now the sad state of Atlantic cod is well known. Overharvesting has severely depleted their stocks in the Gulf of Maine, the North Sea and elsewhere, and commercial fishing has been restricted in the hope that populations will recover.</p>
        <p>But it's not just overfishing that has placed cod in peril. New research by French, British and Danish scientists shows that plankton has added to its misery.</p>
        <p>In a paper published in the journal Nature on Dec. 11, the researchers found that changes in the plankton ecosystem in the North Sea over four decades have affected cod populations. Copepods and other zooplankton are a primary food source for cod in its larval stage.</p>
        <p>The researchers used data obtained from the Continuous Plankton Recorder, a program in place since the 1930's that samples plankton in the North Sea. Since the mid-1980's, they found, the quantity and quality (as measured by size) of plankton has declined, and the period when plankton is most abundant has shifted to later in the year. They say that rising sea temperatures are probably the cause.</p>
        <p>All of this is bad news for cod, which depend on having enough plankton of suitable size around at the right time, before the larvae get too big and are no longer interested in such tiny prey.</p>
        <p>Overharvesting has been a problem in the North Sea since the 1960's. But until the mid-80's, the researchers say, the plankton situation was favorable to cod, and tended to counteract the overfishing. In the last 20 years, though, the plankton changes have exacerbated the overfishing.</p>
        <p>Virtue in Deer Double</p>
        <p>Overharvested is not a word you'd use to describe the white-tail deer, the most abundant game animal in the United States. Yet that hasn't stopped researchers at Texas A&amp;M's veterinary school from cloning the first deer. School officials say the experience from the project may someday help in cloning endangered subspecies like the Key deer in the Florida Keys.</p>
