        <p>Charles T Clark letter says logical conclusion of Katherine Ellison's May 20 Op-Ed is not her submitting to lack of leadership on global warming but her inspiring concerted effort among mothers to do more than buy fluorescent light bulbs</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I know it's naïve, but I couldn't help thinking that the logical conclusion of Katherine Ellison's article isn't her submitting to the lack of leadership on global warming but her inspiring a concerted effort among mothers to do more than buy fluorescent light bulbs.</p>
        <p>With their children's and grandchildren's futures at stake, they could, starting tomorrow, build a culture of conservation, lower their thermostats, get rid of their S.U.V.'s, teach their kids restraint in energy use, and force companies, through sheer economic power, to confront the degradation of our planet.</p>

        <p>What greater expression of maternal concern could there be?</p>
        <p>If we can vote with our dollars, surely we can take a stab at saving ourselves with them. Perhaps even men would follow.</p>
