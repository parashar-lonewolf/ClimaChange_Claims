        <p>This corn and soybean and hog farming town, which pops up out of nowhere at a crossroads and disappears as fast, has only 533 residents left. As in many withering rural communities, worries here lean toward keeping the school open, persuading sons and daughters to stay and finding a role for small farms in a changed economy. But a different worry has risen here, too.</p>
        <p>With government financing and help from state agriculture officials, Reynolds is wrestling with the nation's dependence on ordinary energy supplies and starting a one-town rebellion. Some say the goal may be too ambitious, too fantastic, for any place, much less little Reynolds.</p>
        <p>True, most of the plans are just that, for now. But in the end, the town wants to secede from America's energy grid and power itself entirely with renewable sources, like its corn and pigs.</p>
        <p>The push might seem less surprising in a counterculture bastion like Berkeley, Calif., or even in an ecologically focused city like St. Paul. But Reynolds is in a conservative patch of a largely conservative state, a place where many cars are actually pickups and the word ''environmentalist'' can draw a groan.</p>
        <p>Still, frustration, driven in part by the price of gasoline at the only station in town, has boiled over and rendered ideological labels meaningless.</p>
        <p>King Van Voorst, 85, a longtime resident, blamed Arab nations for the recent spike in gasoline prices. ''We have got to get some kind of energy going over here to show we can do it ourselves,'' Mr. Van Voorst said. ''And why can't we? They need to know that we can do it, and that we don't need them.''</p>
        <p>The State of Indiana first brought the idea to Reynolds last year, calling it BioTown, in an experiment Gov. Mitch Daniels acknowledged could be viewed as a bit of ''a stunt.'' But in the ensuing months and as the price of gasoline soared, Reynolds adopted the notion as its own, and residents began speaking passionately of an end to their reliance on foreign oil and of the potential electricity they could envision in the more than 150,000 pigs that wander nearby.</p>
        <p>Since November, nearly 100 of the community's residents have begun driving cars that can run on ethanol-based fuel, as has the employee who drives one of the town's three vehicles. The other two town cars have been replaced with diesel vehicles, so they can run on bio-diesel fuel like vegetable oil.</p>
        <p>And this month, officials here began work on a plant that would allow Reynolds to draw its electricity from pig and cow manure, as well as human waste. After that, they say they want to make their own renewable natural gas with the methane from the waste of those same pigs, cows and people.</p>
        <p>Plenty of cities have tackled parts of the same concept, filling city fleets with hybrid cars, installing solar panels on municipal building roofs or building miles of bicycle paths, but Thomas C. Dorr, an under secretary for the federal Department of Agriculture, said he knew of no effort as comprehensive as Reynolds's plan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Van Voorst seems a fitting example of this town's unlikely support for the idea. The booming campaign in town to sell cars that can run on ethanol-based fuel to residents at significant discounts may hurt Mr. Van Voorst's own business -- a used-car lot where he sits at a desk most days waiting for someone to step inside.</p>
        <p>Still, he said the effort was worth it, whatever the lost business. In fact, he recently bought himself a new Chevrolet Silverado pickup, a flex-fuel vehicle that can run on E-85, which is 85 percent ethanol, or on regular gasoline.</p>
        <p>In a way, the passion that has emerged seems to be as much about helping to save this town as it is about walking away from the reliance on traditional energy sources.</p>
        <p>The thought that the items so abundant in these fields may create electricity seems to soothe a worry people here have long held about the future of the region's farms. And the common goal of turning this place into BioTown seems to have jump-started the hopes of those who, over the years, have watched two grocery stores close, the Big Boy's garage shut down, the barber move away.</p>
        <p>''There's only one way for this town to go,'' Mr. Van Voorst said.</p>
        <p>The state's choice of Reynolds was nearly happenstance. In 2005, state agriculture officials wandered the map in search of a small town near big roads and with a large livestock population. It was to be not too far from Purdue University, which could supply needed academic assistance for a ''showcase'' on renewable energy.</p>
        <p>Even with financial and technical backing from the state and federal grants from the Department of Energy, there are those here who wonder if BioTown will ever be more than a political press release. Will there really be the more than the $7 million in private financing it will take to design the ''technology suite'' that officials announced here in May to turn animal waste, municipal waste, corn stover and other remains into electricity?</p>
        <p>Jody Snodgrass, a principal at Rose Energy Discovery Inc., the managing investor for the technology, said that the project was already drawing investors, and that construction on the plant would start this fall.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Governor Daniels said that no amount of state encouragement could make the Reynolds plan work; the real test, he said, would lie in private investment in a town that functions solely on renewable fuels. ''Life is risk,'' he said. ''Ultimately, this concept has to be self-sustaining.''</p>
        <p>Already, Reynolds has seen the first snag along the way to self-sufficiency.</p>
        <p>Despite all the new flex-fuel cars on the streets of Reynolds (20 of them two-year leases given away by General Motors, and about 80 more bought by locals, many of whom adorned them with ''BioTown'' license plates), there is no ethanol-based fuel for sale in town.</p>
        <p>The nearest E-85 pump is many miles away, so nearly every car here is still powered by ordinary gasoline.</p>
        <p>John Harris, who owns the only local gas station, said he had faced criticism lately from neighbors. He had hoped to remake his station by now into a ''BioIsland'' that would sell E-85 and bio-diesel. But Mr. Harris, who said he endorsed the notion of his town turning only to renewable fuels, said he found that he could not afford to add underground tanks and pumps, even with financial help.</p>
        <p>As pounding rain fell at the station on a recent afternoon, Mr. Harris, 50, said he was selling the place. His successors, he said, would be able to afford to put in the new tanks, and, with any luck, would be providing ethanol-based fuel by the end of June. Don Good, one of the new owners, said August was more realistic.</p>
        <p>''I like what they're trying to do here,'' Mr. Harris said of the BioTown idea. ''From a business standpoint, though, it's a little shaky.''</p>
        <p>What if he paid hundreds of thousands to install the new tanks, he wondered, and there still were not enough E-85 customers to pay for it? In places like Indiana, home to a small though growing number of the nation's 100 or so ethanol production facilities, the price of E-85 is not much less than ordinary gasoline, Mr. Harris said. What if those with flex-fuel cars went right on buying gasoline?</p>
        <p>''It's a good thing in the long run,'' he said, ''but BioTown basically made me lose the store.''</p>
        <p>At the USA Family Restaurant, the men who gather each morning and afternoon for coffee said they had become firm believers that the lights here, even the coffeepot, would soon be run on the waste from pigs. Almost all of them have bought flex-fuel cars.</p>
        <p>''You get your naysayers, of course, but I'm not one of them,'' said Fred Buschman, a member of the Reynolds Town Council. ''This is as real as it gets.''</p>
