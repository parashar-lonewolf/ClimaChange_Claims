        <p>The oldies stations of 2099 won't be playing much 20th-century pop. While all art is a product of its time, popular music doesn't pretend otherwise. In a century, audio-only music may itself be an antique, superseded by tunes tied to video, virtual reality or direct neural stimuli.</p>
        <p>Oblivion could envelop even the 20th century's most popular songs. Consider Irving Berlin's ''White Christmas,'' the best-selling single until Elton John's ''Candle in the Wind 1997.'' When Bing Crosby recorded it in 1942, it was a taste of home-front coziness in the midst of World War II. The melody uncoils craftily, but what would late-21st-century listeners identify with? Not Christmas cards, long since replaced by e-messaging. And the snow for Bing's white Christmases? Gone with global warming. While pop needs nostalgia for preservation, ''White Chistmas'' may sound like an ecological indictment instead.</p>
