        <p>Long an underdog in the quest for healthy air, New Jersey stands to fall even further behind if recent Federal proposals for more stringent air-quality standards take effect.</p>
        <p>The standards, which would classify lower levels of ozone and smaller particles of soot as unsafe, would make compliance difficult for most state governments, but could make it impossible for New Jersey and other states in the densely packed Northeast to comply on their own.</p>
        <p>Despite obstacles to compliance, Governor Whitman supports the stricter regulations. In fact, she and other Northeast governors are prepared to lobby heavily to have them adopted. The reason is simple: The new rules would enlarge the Government  net over communities that have so far escaped regulation but whose pollution has tended to drift across borders into the Northeast.</p>
        <p>''New Jersey is supporting this because it is looking for help,'' said Alan Krupnick, the co-chairman of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency's subcommittee on ozone, particulates and regional haze implementation programs. ''If the guidelines are strengthened, more areas of the country come under the gun. New Jersey is betting it can shift most of the responsibility upwind.''  It could be a political boon for the Governor, helping her to enhance her environmental portfolio while deflecting criticism of the state's poor air quality to outside sources. The Governor has already announced several environmental projects or goals in recent months. This month she backed a long-stalled initiative that would force New Jersey Transit, the state's mass transit agency, to buy buses that run on alternative fuels, instead of diesel. She has also been able to crow about the measured improvement in air quality throughout the state, with unhealthy ratings being recorded fewer than one day in 20 during last year, as compared to one every 10 days in 1986.</p>
        <p>And while the state came nowhere close to meeting a 15 percent reduction in pollution levels required by the Federal Clean Air Act, the Governor has pointed out that the E.P.A. recently proposed granting interim approval for an ambitious vehicle inspection and maintenance program that could help the state reduce pollution by up to 23 percent.</p>
        <p>Her administration added on Wednesday that the Governor would support the E.P.A.'s proposed regulations. The standards would limit ozone in the air to 80 parts per billion, averaged over an eight-hour period, compared to the current rule that limits it to 120 parts per billion, averaged over one hour. It would also decrease the size of particles that fall under its regulation to 2.5 microns in diameter, causing at least nine counties in New Jersey to fall out of compliance. (Typically, noncompliance draws threats of even tighter restrictions or of withholding Federal highway funds.)</p>
        <p>''She is repositioning herself as a green governor and we will probably see a lot more of this as the year progresses,'' said Richard A. Kassel, a senior lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council. Adding that the Whitman administration recently settled a nine-year-old lawsuit brought by the council over non-implementation of several state pollution control strategies, he added that ''the first couple of years the environment was not on her radar screen.''</p>
        <p>Many environmentalists still wonder if it is on the screen. Curtis Fisher, program director for the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group Citizen Lobby, said that Governor Whitman long ignored calls to restrict the use of diesel buses by New Jersey Transit until this year, had not reined in several badly polluting power plants and had done little to invest in energy efficiency or renewable energy sources.</p>
        <p>''New Jersey is also a source of pollution,'' he added.''If we did a better job at cleaning up our own back yard we would be in a much better position to tell Ohio to clean up its.''</p>
        <p>But doing more cleaning in New Jersey is  becoming increasingly difficult. While many power plants in Ohio and Illinois have yet to install scrubbers on their smokestacks, this is already a common feature in the Northeast where most quick fixes have already been squeezed from industrial polluters and new measures have proved not only more expensive but also politically unpalatable.</p>
        <p>Governor Whitman's auto inspection and maintenance program, for example, has been hotly debated and gone through several changes because of an outcry by motorists and those who service their cars. It remains unclear if or when the program will take effect.</p>
        <p>''The first 50 percent of pollution reduction is easy to get by just putting scrubbers on smokestacks,'' Mr. Kassel said. ''But there are no easy targets left in New Jersey. If everyone stopped driving tomorrow the state would still be in non-compliance because of the pollution coming in from places like Ohio. That's why the stricter standard is absolutely critical.''</p>
        <p>Common wisdom is that the new standard, while slightly increasing the pressure on New Jersey, will disproportionately hit areas in the South and West, whose pollution has long drifted into the Northeast.</p>
        <p>Ray Werner, an E.P.A. official for this region, said that the agency would strongly weigh this fact when calculating new pollution control measures.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. has estimated that even partial national compliance would cost up to $8.5 billion, while the health benefits would be worth up to $120 billion, among them being the reduction of premature deaths.</p>
