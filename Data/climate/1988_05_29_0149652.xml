        <p>LEAD: A HIGH-RISK business venture, begun here with $2 million in Government money, appears headed for success after only seven months of operation.</p>
        <p>A HIGH-RISK business venture, begun here with $2 million in Government money, appears headed for success after only seven months of operation.</p>
        <p>The Cape May Seafood Company, a fish-processing plant, is:</p>
        <p>* Producing and harvesting more than 100 seafood products, including exotica like mahi-mahi fillets, snowcrab clusters and mako shark, and innovative items like microwaveable fish entrees, which its president, Martin Buchalski, said he was seeking to patent.</p>
        <p>* Delivering, within 24 hours of receiving an order, to 225 accounts throughout the Middle Atlantic States, including supermarket chains, hospitals, schools, prisons, epicurean haunts and cabarets in Atlantic City hotel-casinos.</p>
        <p>* Generating revenues for Cape May, whose 80 ships and 15 million-pounds-a-year-catch make it the East Coast's second-largest commercial fishing port, behind New Bedford, Mass.</p>
        <p>* Grossing sales of nearly $5 million annually, and, according to Mr. Buchalski, ''accelerating at an exponential rate.''</p>
        <p>''If anyone needs an example of the big payoff to be had in government-business teamwork, they need look no further than here,'' said Richard Cano, director of the National Marine Fisheries Inspection Service (and a native of Spotswood in Middlesex County), at a recent ceremony at which he gave Cape May Seafood a plaque honoring its success.</p>
        <p>Cape May Seafood was conceived over a kitchen table in nearby Marmora by Martin and Debra Buchalski.</p>
        <p>The 40-year-old Mr. Buchalski is a graduate of Glassboro State College, a former Wildwood lifeguard and a former Campbell Soup Company executive who was in charge of marketing Prego Spaghetti Sauce. Mrs. Buchalski, 32, is a former sales manager for a Philadelphia printing company.</p>
        <p>The Cape May County Department of Economic Development, reeling from the loss of a failed textile mill at a county-owned industrial park here three years ago, and the consequent loss of 400 jobs, sought to replace the mill with a seafood processing plant.</p>
        <p>It solicited bids from entrepreneurs to establish one, holding out as bait $2 million in state and Federal funds with which to convert the mill into a state-of-the-art seafood plant.</p>
        <p>The Buchalskis offered their marketing and food-processing expertise, plus $700,000 in cash - raised mainly from George H. Baldwin Sr. of Bensalem, Pa., now Cape May Seafood's board chairman - and won out in the bidding.</p>
        <p>The plant began operating last Oct. 19 after a ribbon-cutting ceremony with Muhammed Ali, whose name the company plans to use in marketing a fish sausage. The business is driven by the Buchalskis's notion that they can succeed by emphasizing freshness.</p>
        <p>''It seemed a natural tie-in with the state's incessant 'Jersey Fresh' promotional campaign, augmented by mounting consumer worry over fish freshness,'' Mr. Buchalski said in an interview.</p>
        <p>''I had been to Japan to study fish distribution for Campbell Soup, and when the county sought bids, we leaped at the chance to enter ours. I make no bones about it. Our operation is a complete knock-off of Japanese fish distribution methodology, with emphasis on freshness and sanitation.''</p>
        <p>To achieve freshness and cleanliness, Cape May Seafood:</p>
        <p>* Breaks down all fish-processing machinery to its most-basic component parts and scours it nightly.</p>
        <p>* Insists that all employees wear white hair covers and sanitary gloves and use hand-dip sterilization stations repeatedly throughout the day.</p>
        <p>* Spot-checks continuously, in an in-house microbiology laboratory, bacteria levels of fish passing along the production line.</p>
        <p>* Makes its own ice to avoid contamination through tainted water from outside suppliers.</p>
        <p>* Limits seafood purchases to those boats whose captains enjoy reputations for keeping their catches fresh.</p>
        <p>* Freshness-dates its microwave entrees to insure that their shelf life limit of seven days is not exceeded.</p>
        <p>* Scrutinizes all fillets and steaks over candling tables that reveal the presence of bones and parasites.</p>
        <p>* Submits voluntarily, at its own expense, all of its output to examination by on-site, full-time Government inspectors. According to the Federal Department of Commerce, Cape May Seafood is the only fish processor in New Jersey to do so.</p>
        <p>''Most consumers assume that fish, like meat and poultry, is rigorously inspected by the Government and certified as clean, safe and wholesome,'' Mr. Buchalski said, ''but nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
        <p>''I regret to say that our industry is rife with instances of abuse. Of course, those very shortcomings have created a market opening for us.''</p>
        <p>There is no doubt that the recent rash of nationally publicized cases of fish poisoning, including the first cholera outbreaks since 1911, has helped Cape May Seafood's sales.</p>
        <p>Although fish consumption in the States is at a record high (14.7 pounds per capita last year), only 7 percent of America's 1,900 seafood processors now participate in the Government's inspection program, a percentage that has plunged in recent years as fish prices have skyrocketed. A Federal inspection official, quoted in The Wall Street Journal last month (april) said:</p>
        <p>''When business is bad, processors seek the marketing advantage of our Grade A certification; when business is good, they don't.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Buchalski foresees mandatory Federal fish inspection and says that ''when it comes, we will be poised as the industry paragon.''</p>
        <p>Cape May Seafood's inspection and sanitation procedures add significantly to its costs, which are passed on to customers as higher prices.</p>
        <p>''I'm happy to say that our customers readily pay the premium,'' Mr. Buchalski said. ''It's no exaggeration to say that restaurateurs and supermarket managers are in a state of panic over fish food poisoning.</p>
        <p>''As one chain-store buyer said to me the other day, 'I'll gladly pay you 10 cents extra a pound just to sleep easy.' ''</p>
        <p>In addition to mandatory inspection, Mr. Buchalski foresees other major changes for the national and New Jersey fishing industries. The latter generates $500 million a year for the state, according to the Department of Agriculture in Trenton, and accounts for half of all fish harvested by the Middle Atlantic States.</p>
        <p>''We've lost most of our local fluke and only recently learned that marine fishery stocks overall are being decimated by acid rain,'' Mr. Buchalski said. ''This will necessitate two major shifts in New Jersey fishery activity.</p>
        <p>''First, we must begin to invest heavily in aquaculture, or fish-farming, as states down South already have. I predict that, within 10 years, farm-raised catfish will supplant flounder as our No. 1 piscatorial delight.''</p>
        <p>''Second, we must begin to eat many of the delicious underutilized species, which locally include porgies and mackerel.''</p>
        <p>Eighty percent of all fish is consumed in restaurants,'' Mr. Buchalski said, adding:</p>
        <p>''Their menus shape American fish preferences. Restaurateurs don't like porgies and mackerel because they're cheap and make it difficult to charge fancy prices.</p>
        <p>''We must start popularizing those species and, in fact, we at Cape May Seafood have already begun to promote them.''</p>
        <p>Citing what he described as a ''tasty morsel of fish trivia,'' Mr. Buchalski said that the name mackerel derived from the French ''after the ancient belief that the species acted as matchmakers for the schools of herring that mackerel invariably accompany.''</p>
        <p>''It means,'' he said, '' 'Pimp of the Sea.' ''</p>
