        <p>ICE</p>
        <p>The Nature, the History, and the Uses of an</p>
        <p>Astonishing Substance.</p>
        <p>By Mariana Gosnell.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 560 pp.</p>
        <p>Alfred A. Knopf. $30.</p>
        <p>Most of us don't spend a lot of time contemplating where, when, how and why ice forms. We clink our cubes round our cocktails without a thought about frozen water's role in shaping the earth, in changing the climate, or even in forming us. But Mariana Gosnell has thought long and hard about all of this, and more. Her 560-page ''Ice: The Nature, the History, and the Uses of an Astonishing Substance'' is the fascinating and dauntingly comprehensive result.</p>
        <p>Gosnell travels to the ends of the earth, into the clouds and under the frozen sea to conduct her investigations, interviewing chemical engineers, glaciologists, liquid-state theorists, atmospheric physicists, climatologists and geochemists. Through 36 chapters, Gosnell, a former reporter for Newsweek and the author of ''Zero Three Bravo: Solo Across America in a Small Plane,'' writes in a clear and amiable manner about the gazillion different forms that ice takes and the varying effects it has on everything from dirt to fruits and vegetables, animals, people, planets and inanimate objects like airplane wings and bridges. She covers the freezing and melting of rivers and lakes; the construction of ice roads; surging glaciers, marine ice sheets, icebergs (yes, the Titanic), polar travel (yes, Shackleton) and scientists who drill ice cores, some of them miles long, to study the climate of yore and global warming today.</p>
        <p>Lonnie Thompson is a pioneer in this field, but instead of drilling in Greenland or Antarctica, he labors in the death zones atop equatorial mountains, which makes transporting his ice cores to northern laboratories epic. Gosnell spends a few pages on Thompson, but Mark Bowen, an alpinist and physicist, has written a whole book about him. THIN ICE: Unlocking the Secrets of Climate in the World's Highest Mountains (John Macrae/Holt, $30) is a lively but sometimes padded history of greenhouse science and a warning about the disintegration of some of the planet's iciest places.</p>
        <p>After plowing through Gosnell's descriptions of frost-wedging, frost pulling, permafrost, pingos (cones of ice and soil rising as high as 150 feet), icicles, ice storms, frost, sleet, rime, graupel (like hail but smaller), hail, cloud seeding and ice halos, readers might wonder how much more can be said on the subject of frozen water. The answer is: Plenty. Gosnell forges on to explore the remarkable adaptations of plants that survive frigid temperatures (ever wonder how Florida oranges survive a freeze?), vertebrates that live on or around ice (yes, emperor penguins) and communities of algae, bacteria, ciliates, rotifers, copepods and nematodes that live on the undersides of sea ice. Polar bear behavior is pretty cool, but that tiny stuff? Even cooler: ''By subtly warming their immediate environment . . . one-celled algae alter global weather patterns thousands of kilometers away.'' Closer to home, Gosnell focuses on humans' physiological responses to cold -- frostbite, hypothermia, the chilling of organs for transplant, the reattachment of amputated appendages (yes, John Wayne Bobbitt) and cryopreservation. ''As of this writing,'' she reports, ''the bodies or heads or brains of about 100 people worldwide are being kept in long-term storage facilities at temperatures as low as 320 degrees F.''</p>
        <p>If chapters on extraplanetary ice and new forms of ice produced in laboratories make dry reading, descriptions of ice games (skating, curling, hockey and bobsledding), frozen confections and artisans who carve palaces out of frozen water are the sugar that helps the medicine go down. Gosnell herself remains enthusiastic, and wryly humorous throughout. She affectionately mocks a few scientists, takes a crack at Vonnegut (yes, Ice-9) and has a little fun with whales: when a bowhead thrusts its lower jaw through an ice hummock, protruding three feet into the air, she comments, parenthetically, ''Why abrade your blowhole more than you have to?'' (O.K., maybe you had to be there.)</p>
        <p>Gosnell isn't afraid of complex or technical material, but she takes a huge risk in assuming readers will follow her anywhere. ''Ice'' is extraordinarily wide-ranging. Unfortunately, so much of its action is too far away or too small to see. It may be philistine to say so, but the book's most exciting parts are those that cover the dramas of large machines and animals falling through lake ice, hail pounding antelope, icebergs wiping out oil rigs and lovers leaping over tumbling blocks of ice at the foot of Niagara Falls. That's good stuff, and the author herself isn't immune to such thrills. Of an ice breaker working the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, she writes, ''O the destruction! The violence! I was breathless with shock, something was happening that oughtn't to, some harm being done that should be stopped, as if somebody were breaking the best china, an intact thing being smashed to pieces!''</p>
        <p>For anyone who doubts that ice is as significant to the history of the world as, say, cod, Gosnell frequently underscores the implications of its physical properties. Ice is the solid phase of life's essential liquid. Almost all other substances are denser and heavier as solids than as liquids, but ice is lighter. It floats. Is that a big deal? Well, yes: if it didn't, frozen seas and lakes would never have melted, oceans would fill with ice from the bottom up, and marine life would die. Humans might never have evolved. When we get to the chapters on ice in space, we learn that we are made up of material that was brought to the earth by comets, which themselves are made up of . . . ice. As Joni Mitchell wrote, and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, sang, ''We are stardust.'' Or as one astronomer told Gosnell, ''no ice, no us.''</p>
        <p>By giving ''Ice'' the more-is-more treatment, Gosnell has created a Kama Sutra for pagophiles -- lovers of ice -- and provided cocktail chatterers with an endless trove of cube-related trivia. Oil companies employ ice observers to scout for and map bergs in the North Atlantic. The Army Corps of Engineers' most requested publication is ''Pothole Primer.'' In winter, the proportion of glycerol antifreeze in the body fluid of the gall-moth caterpillar is nearly as high as the proportion of ethylene glycol in fluids added to car radiators in southern Canada. Some of the 65,000 ice houses on Minnesota's Mille Lacs contain televisions, bathrooms and bars. Each winter, North Americans put 10 to 15 million tons of salt on their roads -- that's 10 percent of all the salt used in the entire world every year for all purposes combined. To de-ice its rail switches and couplers, Metro-North relies on hair dryers, among other devices. The most common subject for an ice sculpture is a swan.</p>
        <p>By the time you finish this remarkable book (it may take a few seasons), you'll never think about freezing and melting in quite the same way. You'll understand that water doesn't get colder in order to freeze, it gives up heat. And that in order for your cocktail to be chilled, it must give up some of its heat to the ice, which will, in turn, cause your ice to melt. If that's too much physics for you, remember this rule of thumb: frozen frogs can be thawed overnight in a refrigerator, but it will be 24 hours before you can expect them to jump. Cool.</p>
