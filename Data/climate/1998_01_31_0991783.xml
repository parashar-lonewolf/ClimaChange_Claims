        <p>The Clinton Administration is proposing generous new tax credits for consumers who buy advanced automobiles that use emerging technologies to go two or three times as far on a gallon of gas as today's models.</p>
        <p>The credits would lower an auto buyer's Federal income tax bill by $3,000 to $4,000, substantially cutting the net cost of vehicles that are likely, at first, to be more expensive than today's models. The subsidy, which would start in the year 2000, is meant to jump-start the mass production of exotic cars, trucks, vans and sport utility vehicles using novel technologies that are still on manufacturers' drawing boards.</p>
        <p>The subsidies are the centerpiece of a $6.3 billion package of tax credits and research subsidies intended to fight the threat of global warming caused by emissions from burning fossil fuels. The package is part of President Clinton's budget request for the 1999 fiscal year.</p>
        <p>Other parts of the tax proposal are intended to encourage owners of homes, factories, power plants and others to adopt solar power and other energy-efficiency technologies. One provision would give a $2,000 tax credit for the purchase of an energy-efficient new home.</p>
        <p>The President is to submit his budget proposal to Congress on Monday, and he will discuss the energy-related tax incentives in his Saturday morning radio address, White House officials said today.</p>
        <p>If Congress approves the tax subsidies -- which is by no means assured -- the measures could help make the new types of cars more affordable and help halt the recent American trend away from fuel-efficient vehicles.</p>
        <p>Auto makers have already been tinkering with vehicles that would use hybrid gas-and-electric engines or even more efficient fuel cells instead of ordinary internal combustion engines, and several makers have said that such cars could become available in the next few years. Toyota has already introduced one model, the Prius, in Japan.</p>
        <p>The $3,000 tax credit would begin in 2000 and would apply to any car that gets double the mileage of the average car of similar size. The $4,000 credit would begin in 2003, and would go to those who buy cars with triple the normal mileage. Both credits would phase out in later years, giving the most incentive to the earliest buyers.</p>
        <p>To qualify for the proposed $3,000 tax credit, a midsized car would have to get about 45 miles a gallon.</p>
        <p>Ari Fleischer, the spokesman for Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, responded skeptically to the President's proposal.</p>
        <p>''As worthy as it sounds and may be, it is terribly complicated,'' Mr. Fleischer said of tax credits to stimulate specific economic activities. He said Mr. Archer was committed to steps that would simplify, not further complicate, the tax code.</p>
        <p>The automotive tax credits would cost about $660 million over the next five years, officials said.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the American Automobile Manufacturers Association declined to comment on the plan, saying the car makers had not had a chance to examine its details.</p>
        <p>Environmental advocates welcomed the proposals.</p>
        <p>''We call on the Congress to recognize the broad economic and environmental benefits,'' said Howard Geller, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Geller also urged Congress to finance the research and development initiatives and approve the tax incentives.</p>
        <p>The package also includes research subsidies to spur innovations in solar power, energy efficiency, and alternative fuels that give off less carbon dioxide than oil and coal.</p>
        <p>A Clinton Administration official said that among the tax credits would be significant subsidies for owners of homes and businesses who  install solar systems on their roofs, either to heat water or to generate electricity.</p>
        <p>In another incentive for businesses, the Administration will propose investment tax credits to reward companies that install highly efficient equipment that generates electricity as well as capturing heat for industrial processes.</p>
        <p>And it will propose expanding a tax benefit through which employers can subsidize workers' commuting expenses by paying mass transit fares, just as many workers receive free parking as a tax-free benefit.</p>
        <p>The Administration will also propose extending an existing tax credit for electric utilities that generate power with windmills. The subsidy is due to expire.</p>
        <p>In all, the tax credits would amount to an estimated $3.6 billion in lost revenues over the five years beginning in October. In addition, the Administration is calling for $2.7 billion in new Federal spending on energy conservation and related research over the five-year period.</p>
        <p>The research subsidies would be focused on about five areas, an Administration official said.</p>
        <p>These include efficient technologies for heating and cooling buildings, including advanced household appliances; further research into advanced automobile technologies; other transportation-related research, like fuel efficient heavy trucks and transit programs; conservation technologies for energy-intensive industries like steel, paper, and chemicals; and technologies involving renewable energy sources.</p>
