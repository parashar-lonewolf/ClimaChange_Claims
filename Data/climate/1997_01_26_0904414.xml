        <p>MYSTIC is known for the tourist traffic that clogs its streets, not searching for solutions to automobile-induced air pollution. Yet it is in Mystic that Dr. Herster Barres has founded a nonprofit organization called Reforest the Tropics Inc., that just may help in the antipollution wars.</p>
        <p>The Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies has endorsed Dr. Barres' effort, as has the Federal Government; the Connecticut Business and Industry Association has sent its members information about the project. Five area schools now include Dr. Barres' ideas in their studies of the environment.</p>
        <p>The focus of this attention surrounds the klinki tree, a straight, fast-growing conifer native to Papua New Guinea, with narrow, dark green leaves. After 27 years of experimentation, Dr. Barres, a former United Nations forestry officer, is convinced that planting klinki is one way to help lower levels of carbon dioxide in the air, helping to mitigate the threat of global warming.</p>
        <p>If Dr. Barres' project succeeds, farmers in Costa Rica and, he hopes, elsewhere in Central and South America will soon be planting klinkis mixed with native trees on land that would otherwise be in pasture. Dr. Barres is a true believer, with 100,000 klinkis growing in a Costa Rican nursery and at least 100 of various sizes growing under artificial light in his Mystic condominium. Trees are only part of the answer.</p>
        <p>''The best solution lies in finding alternatives to fossil fuels,'' Dr. Barres said, explaining that the 500 million cars in the world today -- and an estimated 1 billion by 2030 -- produce huge amounts of carbon dioxide as they burn gasoline.</p>
        <p>But trees are important because they absorb carbon dioxide, storing carbon in the form of wood and releasing oxygen. Dr. Barres, who wrote his doctoral thesis on fast-growing trees, wasn't interested in just any tree. ''Unless the farmer says, 'Wow, I'd like to plant that,' you aren't going to get him to plant,'' Dr. Barres said. He aimed to find a tree that farmers would be excited about, a cash crop that would also be good for the soil and whose branches wouldn't sweep out too widely so that they could be planted densely.</p>
        <p>The klinki tree fits the bill. Klinkis have existed for 160 million years, dating to the Jurassic era during which dinosaurs roamed the earth. They grow to 280 feet high and 6 feet in diameter; they are also pest resistant and don't mind shade. They make excellent plywood and grow so straight that they can easily be used for utility poles, which Costa Rica and other such countries are currently forced to import.</p>
        <p>At the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, of which Dr. Barres is a graduate, the dean, Dr. Jared Cohen, said, ''We're impressed by his work. He is practical and a dreamer, too, the kind of person that can make things happen. ''</p>
        <p>Assistant dean Gordon Geballe, added, ''The school as an institution is lending its name to the project. Where he needs research done or a study done, we're standing in the wings. But the way we can really be useful isn't a big part of the story. The great part of the story is how the project affects Costa Rica itself.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Barres thought Costa Rica was a natural starting place. ''Because of the educational resources of Costa Rica, it tends to be a bellwether country'' in Latin America, he said. Dr. Barres has 40 farmers willing to plant klinkis on 6,000 acres of land. He hopes to involve several hundred more farmers in the next few years.</p>
        <p>President Bill Clinton's Climate Change Action Plan chose Dr. Barres' project as one of the most promising to help combat global warming, coordinating United States interests with those of farmers in Costa Rica.</p>
        <p>But to Pam Ryley, one of the best aspects of Dr. Barres' project is the tangible way it brings to the classroom the problems of air pollution and global warming.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ryley, an instructor at Cutler Middle School in Mystic, took a week last year to teach students about global warming, using the klinki tree as a focus. Seventh and eighth grade students planted klinki seeds, conducted carbon experiments, studied photosynthesis and heard from Dr. Barres, whom they called ''Dr. Klinki.''</p>
        <p>''The more they know about global warming, the better equipped they are to help in solutions,'' Ms. Ryley said. ''Dr. Barres's enthusiasm on the project really rubbed off on the kids.'' Aside from Cutler, the klinki project was in the curriculum at Fitch Middle School in Groton, Noank Elementary School and Pine Point School in Stonington.</p>
        <p>The Connecticut Business and Industry Association was intrigued enough to send 50 of its members information about the klinki project. ''This is a little bit of an unusual case,'' said Eric J. Brown, director of the group's environmental policy council. ''This is an example of a homegrown initiative with a national and international scope. The companies may not be interested in it, but we want to make them aware of the project.''</p>
        <p>The association was careful not to take sides on the controversy concerning global warming. ''We aren't in a position to say it is happening or it isn't happening,'' Mr. Brown said. ''We try to keep companies involved in projects that help the environment, but we leave it to them to decide.''</p>
        <p>As for Dr. Barres, he feels that ''Clearly we have to work principally on reducing emissions; fixing carbon through forestry is only a partial solution. But if we started 40 years ago, we'd be far ahead.''</p>
