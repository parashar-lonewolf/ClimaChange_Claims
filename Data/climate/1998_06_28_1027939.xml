        <p>WORKING between the tides, teams of students and their instructors are digging along the shore of Cape May to unearth history. The teams can work some of the sites only during low tide and then must shift to other inland digs when the tide rises</p>
        <p>The students are enrolled in a six-week course, ''Field Study: Prehistoric Native American Coastal Archeology,'' given by the Rutgers University Department of Archeology at sites in the Cape May National Wildlife Refuge and on private land along the Delaware Bay. The 22 students receive six credits for the work, which includes lectures and work with the on-site staff and visiting scholars.</p>
        <p>The site work is part of a research project Rutgers has been conducting for four years. The study of how prehistoric residents of the area lived will try to reconstruct landscapes from the Paleo-Indian Period, 10,000 to 12,000 year ago. It will look into how the prehistoric inhabitants responded as the area changed from an interior upland, freshwater region to a salt-water one. This change resulted from a steadily rising sea level, which inundated more of the land.</p>
        <p>Because coastal erosion continues to threaten the area, study sites closest to the water, and therefore most threatened, are being studied first.</p>
        <p>The artifacts already uncovered include a variety of shaped projectile points and other stone tools, pieces of ceramic containers, and the remnants of bone, shell and other matter from ancient campsites.</p>
        <p>Along a stretch of private beach in the refuge area, Anthony Frau, above at left, Jesse Muscle and Kelly O'Connell felt through excavated mud as they searched for artifacts.</p>
