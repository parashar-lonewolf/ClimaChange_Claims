        <p>The Du Pont Company said that within five years its factories would stop emitting a gas that eats away at the earth's protective ozone layer. Du Pont set the timetable to eliminate nitrous oxide, which is produced while making a raw material in nylon.</p>
        <p>Du Pont said its announcement was in response to an article published on Feb. 22 in Science, the journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, that said nitrous oxide can eat away at the ozone layer and thus act as an agent of global warming. Du Pont has been developing a process to recycle the gas instead of burning or releasing it into the atmosphere. The process should be ready within five years.</p>
