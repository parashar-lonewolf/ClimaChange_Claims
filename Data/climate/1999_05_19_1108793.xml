        <p>Students are gaining awareness of the environment, reports the Environmental Literacy Council, a nonprofit group, but that does not mean they know very much about it.</p>
        <p>More than 30 states now require teaching environmental concepts in grade school and high school, the council said in a recent report. But it also complained that environmental studies are often tacked on at the end of science classes; that texts for young children do not engage their curiosity about the natural world, and that texts for older students focus on the politics of the environment rather than the science.</p>
        <p>The council cited a study finding that only 35 percent of Wisconsin fifth graders knew that scientists suspect a link between climate change and the use of fossil fuels. The same percentage thought that climate change might be occurring because the Sun is moving closer to the Earth.</p>
