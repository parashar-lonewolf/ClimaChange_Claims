        <p>LEAD: NOW is the time to think about having enough water for the garden. Although no one can ever predict the weather accurately, it is practical to think ahead. Even those pundits who forecast weather several days in advance are often wrong.</p>
        <p>NOW is the time to think about having enough water for the garden. Although no one can ever predict the weather accurately, it is practical to think ahead. Even those pundits who forecast weather several days in advance are often wrong.</p>
        <p>Planning should be a rule because the days of ample water are over. More and more, the supply of water is being threatened, if not from warming weather patterns - the greenhouse effect from the burning of fossil fuels - then with contamination of water from underground sources or seepage or both. Those who rely on their own wells often face serious water shortages, especially during the summer.</p>
        <p>Granted, the Northeast is known as a moist region, and there usually is ample rainfall, as there was last spring. But this is not always true, and water restrictions are clamped down quickly, as soon as there is even a hint of a water shortage. In addition, government officials usually start curtailments with non-essential water uses, particularly lawns and gardens.</p>
        <p>So wise, indeed, is any gardener who thinks about the season ahead. Such a common-sense effort has been called naturescaping, and it consists largely of things that can be done to waterproof your garden for summer.</p>
        <p>Start with the soil, especially at this time of year when the planting season is getting under way. The addition of as much organic matter as possible will aid the soil in its retention of moisture. The easiest way to add organic matter to soil is to rake it over the planting bed in a layer and dig it in.</p>
        <p>The addition of decomposed compost or leaf mold adds binding particles and helps the soil to hold moisture. Pore spaces in sandy soils are large, for example, and if these can be filled in with moisture-retaining organic materials, all to the good.</p>
        <p>Clay soil has tiny, sticky particles. Just rub them together between fingers, and you will feel their fine texture. When organic matter is added to clay soil, the soil becomes easier to work, and the added particles cause the gluey clay to separate and hold moisture rather than form a crust.</p>
        <p>Compost is among the best organic materials to add, and if it is not available, try aged manures from the barnyard (never fresh because of the high urine content), leaves and rakings from the spring cleanup, seaweed, aged sawdust or small-grade wood chips. Any of these materials can be worked into the soil to increase the water-holding capacity. Those who have been following this habit for years will confirm that their soil is more fertile, the gardens grow better and the gardeners have less worry during drought.</p>
        <p>Another water-saving measure is to plant all of the plants that will need water in one place. This is particularly true for vegetable gardeners. Although mulches will help to keep the moisture in the soil and keep the roots cool and weed free, planting the vegetables in one patch rather than spreading them out over the landscape will help to keep water-needing crops in one place. Then when a hose is needed, it can be used efficiently. Remember that drip-watering systems are highly recommended, as these devises, when installed properly, can save up to 50 percent of the water.</p>
        <p>Also, thin-leaved plants like impatiens, coleus, petunias and most annuals, need attention and water. Keep these showy plants in places close to the house where water can be carried to them, if need be. Water from dehumidifiers is a great source of supply, as is water from cooking.</p>
        <p>The key is to plan water management, to design a water-conserving landscape and to work with the soil to increase its water-holding capacity. And remember to keep plants strong and vibrant. A weak garden is never going to survive stress.</p>
        <p>There is no better time than now to apply fertilizer to established plants. Use a general garden fertilizer like 5-10-5, and follow the application directions on the package. Gardeners know that stronger plants require less coddling and water.</p>
        <p>Northeast gardeners may not have to be as drastic in their choices of plants as some of their Western cousins, who are learning the merits of xeriscaping (taken from the Greek for dry gardening). Eastern gardeners will not have to resort to cactuses and succulents, but they can emphasize native plants. Those local species have been around and survived for a long time.</p>
        <p>A research plant information bulletin from the Morton Arboretum in Lisle, Ill., concludes: ''No one is certain of future weather patterns. While it is true that we can do little about the weather, in order to grow plants successfully, we need to use better cultural and landscape management practices. Through proper plant selection and use, our landscape plants will have a better chance to survive during a drought.''</p>
