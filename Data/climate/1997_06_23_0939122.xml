        <p>Clinton Calls for Scrutiny Of Tobacco Settlement  President Clinton encouraged critics of the tobacco settlement agreement to regard it only as a starting point, and said he feared that it might hobble the Government's regulation of nicotine.</p>
        <p>The President did say he was pleased with the reception that even critics of the proposed settlement had given it, but repeated that he would withhold judgment on the deal until his Administration had reviewed it. $(Page A1.$)</p>
        <p>The agreement suggests that the tobacco companies will pass most of its cost on to smokers, but it has little to say about how and when that will happen. $(B9.$)</p>
        <p>The settlement, as proposed, would provide plaintiffs' lawyers -- both those representing smokers in lawsuits and those acting for states in Medicaid-related claims -- with the biggest windfall in legal history. $(B9.$)</p>
        <p>C-Net Readies New On-Line Service  Though the Internet industry is littered with consumer on-line services that have failed, C-Net, a source of on-line information, is planning to introduce a service to compete with America Online, Compuserve and the Microsoft Network. $(D2.$)</p>
        <p>Tax Plans Are Said to Favor the Rich  The changes in Federal tax and benefit policies proposed in Congress would eventually be worth thousands of dollars a year to the wealthiest families, while those with the lowest incomes would lose money, a study by a liberal research group shows. $(B6.$)</p>
        <p>The Drive-In Theater, Updated  General Motors has begun a novel effort to gently advertise its cars at a movie theater complex in suburban Detroit. The promotion goes far beyond simply running ads during film previews to include displays of models like the Chevrolet Corvette, and other promotions. Advertising. $(D7.$)</p>
        <p>An Industrialized Split on Pollution  The heads of the leading industrial nations, meeting in Denver, agreed on a number of foreign policy goals. But in a sharp dispute with France and other European nations, President Clinton refused to commit the United States to a specific reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases. $(A1.$)</p>
        <p>A Radio Giant Is Born  Jacor Communications has gone from being a bit player in the radio business to one of its rising stars, thanks to deregulation and a Wall Street-financed buying binge. $(D6.$)</p>
        <p>Planning Computer Games for Girls  A number of companies in Silicon Valley and elsewhere expect to tap into the multimillion-dollar computer game market, traditionally dominated by shoot 'em up games for males, with games and specially designed products that they maintain make computers and technology more accessible to girls. $(D3.$)</p>
        <p>Two years ago, hundreds of video game companies abandoned the cluttered floors of the huge computer trade shows, setting up the Electronic Entertainment Expo to train the spotlight on their own products. Now, some of the companies they left behind are joining them. $(D3.$)</p>
        <p>Might the Thrill Be Gone?  In contrast to the usual hubbub that surrounds a new Michael Jackson album, the pop singer's latest release, ''Blood on the Dance Floor: History in The Mix,'' was accompanied by hardly a sound -- in the United States, at least. Like other recent Jackson albums, it has done better overseas. $(D6.$)</p>
        <p>Advertisers' Influence in Magazines  Demonstrating how clouded the once-solid line between advertising and editorial content in magazines has become, the American Society of Magazine Editors is urging editors to resist influence from advertisers about what appears in their publications. $(D7.$)</p>
