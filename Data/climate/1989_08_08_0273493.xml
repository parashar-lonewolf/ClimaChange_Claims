        <p>LEAD: ACID rain falling on the Yucatan peninsula and much of southern Mexico is fast bringing destruction to the temples, colorful murals and aunting megaliths of the ancient Maya civilization, art historians and archeologists say.</p>
        <p>ACID rain falling on the Yucatan peninsula and much of southern Mexico is fast bringing destruction to the temples, colorful murals and aunting megaliths of the ancient Maya civilization, art historians and archeologists say.</p>
        <p>Evidence of widespread damage to the Maya ruins is the most telling example yet that acid rain, which can blight forests and lakes as well as damage stone structures, is not confined to the world's northern industrial regions. It is a clear warning signal, environmental experts say, that this form of ''chemical weathering'' is threatening the millions of acres of tropical rain forests in southern Mexico and Central America.</p>
        <p>Alarming amounts of acid rain were also reported earlier this year over central Africa, caused by pollutants from the burning of thousands of square miles of grasslands. The Maya fallout, by contrast, is attributed to pollutants from oil refineries and tourist buses.</p>
        <p>The damage to Maya treasures is greatest, the experts say, in the temples at Palenque, where paint is flaking off by the handsful and stucco surfaces and stone inscriptions are corroding and crumbling. A black crust of acid deposit coats one wall of the Great Ball Court at Chichen Itza. Archeological treasures at Coba, Chicanna, Uxmal and other sites are also showing acid's devastating effects.</p>
        <p>''We've been struggling with this problem since the mid-1970's, and it's getting worse,'' said Dr. Richard E. W. Adams, an archeologist at the University of Texas at San Antonio, who specializes in Maya research.</p>
        <p>''I have seen a marked difference in the buildings and statues'' over the last decade, said Dr. Dorie Reents-Budet, curator of pre-Columbian art at Duke University. ''It's happening at all the sites.'' Dr. Seymour Lewin, a professor of chemistry at New York University and an authority on stone preservation, said acid rain's ruinous attack on statues and archeological sites is ''becoming a worldwide phenomenon,'' from the Parthenon and Michelangelo's David to the Taj Mahal and the hundreds of stone monuments on the battleground at Gettysburg.</p>
        <p>In a three-year study, supported by the National Geographic Society, Dr. Merle Greene Robertson, an art historian and director of the Pre-Columbian Art Research Institute in San Francisco, not only documented that ''the sculpture and architecture of the Maya civilization are being destroyed by acidic precipitation'' but warned that surrounding forests ''are now subject to increasing levels of acidic rainfall.''</p>
        <p>Although damage to the forests is not apparent yet, Dr. Robertson recommended that the governments of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras and Cuba as well as international organizations ''commence studies on the effects of acidic precipitation on the tropical environments of Mesoamerica.'' Damage to Tombstones</p>
        <p>Dr. Robertson said in a recently completed report on the study, that researchers used meteorological observations to trace the source of the Yucatan's acid rain mainly to emissions from uncapped Mexican oil wells and oilfield smokestacks near Coatzacoalcos and Ciudad del Carmen on the Gulf of Mexico. The wells are operated by Pemex, the Government-owned petroleum company. The nearest oil field is 75 miles from Palenque and 250 miles from Chichen Itza.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lewin had earlier called attention to the effects of oil refinery emissions on monumental stone in a study of limestone monuments in an 18th century Jewish cemetery on the island of Curacao, off Venezuela. Comparing plaster casts taken of the tombstone inscriptions with the condition of the actual stones after years of exposure to refinery vapors, Dr. Lewin found ''an enormous difference, with the inscriptions practically gone.''</p>
        <p>The burning of petroleum produces oxides of nitrogen and sulfur that rise into the upper atmosphere. There they are borne by wind and undergo chemical reactions with sunlight and moisture. After a few days, the sulfuric acid and nitric acid particles fall as acid rain or as dry acidic debris. The acid rain eats into the stone surfaces at once. The dry particles settle into crevices, ledges and molding, and the damage they create comes later, when rain comes in contact with the deposits and creates corrosive chemical reactions.</p>
        <p>Besides its immediate damage, Dr. Lewin said, acid rain acts as ''an opening wedge,'' creating cracks and pits that make the stone increasingly vulnerable to damage from ordinary water seepage and invasion by decay-causing microorganisms. Most of the ordinary wear and tear on the Maya structures, which have survived 700 to 1,500 years, has come from exposure to moisture, mold, bacteria and roots of vegetation in the humid jungle. Acid rain is believed to be accelerating these processes.</p>
        <p>One of the ugliest manifestations of the accumulation of acid fallout takes the form of a ''black scab.'' Even if the deposits are removed with extreme care, archeologists said, underlying paint and stucco usually flake off in the process. Vivid Colors Now Covered</p>
        <p>Dr. Robertson, who has studied Maya art for years, used pictures taken in the early 1970's to document the rapid deterioration that has occurred at several archeological sites. Some of the stucco walls that used to be painted red or blue, she said, are now virtually white from the acid-caused flaking. Moldings and inscriptions are severely eroded.</p>
        <p>At Coba, she said, the interior of the Temple of the Paintings once was decorated with murals in vivid colors, but now the walls are ''in such a devastated condition that there is very little one can see inside this shrine except the black scab, bacteria and mold that covers everything.''</p>
        <p>A stone carving at Palenque was cleaned of black scab in the early 1980's Dr. Robertson said, and is already being recoated.</p>
        <p>Although the Mexican government has blamed much of the damage on volcanic releases from El Chich'on, which erupted in 1984, Dr. Robertson said in an interview that photographic evidence indicated that the volcanic fallout, though severe, was a relatively minor contributor to the erosion of the ruins. Archeologists said the only cause for greater damage than acid rain is the rampant vandalism at Maya sites.</p>
        <p>Charles Gallenkamp, an archeologist in Albuquerque, N.M., and coordinator of a recent exhibition of Maya artifacts on a nationwide tour, said: ''The problem is beyond dispute. It's only a question of what can be done about it. Mexicans are very sensitive about protecting their archeological patrimony. But this brings you up against some very powerful commercial interests at a time when the country is having all kinds of economic troubles.'' 'Politically Explosive' Issue</p>
        <p>Louis E. V. Nevaer, editor of Mesoamerica, an English language quarterly journal published in Merida, said acid rain was a ''politically explosive'' issue in Mexico.</p>
        <p>He said the Government had officially acknowledged acid rain as a problem only in the Mexico City area. With the reports of damage to Maya sculpture and buildings, however, Mexico will be open to criticism from international ecological and archeological groups and perhaps from neighboring countries vulnerable to the fallout.</p>
        <p>''It's risky to be critical of Pemex in Mexico,'' Mr. Nevaer said.in an interview. ''Pemex is the country's No. 1 earner of hard currency.''</p>
        <p>The journal Mr. Nevaer edits is published by the Mesoamerica Foundation, an organization that arranges for the exchange of scholars in economics, politics, arts and sciences between the United States and Mexico. Dr. Robertson's report was published by the foundation. Exhaust of Tour Buses</p>
        <p>Not all the damage is traceable to the Pemex oilfields. Dr. Robertson said the rapid deterioration of painted walls at the Temple of the Frescoes at Tulum was caused by the exhaust of tour buses that stand for hours with their motors running in front of the stone structures.</p>
        <p>Indeed, archeologists said one reason the Guatemala ruins have largely escaped similar damage is because they are less accessible to tourists. Another reason, Dr. Reents-Budet said, is that the remote sites have not been cleared of overarching vegetation, which acts as a screen protecting the stones against much of the acid rain fallout.</p>
        <p>''It is only recently that we have come to realize that painted sculpture and structures in ancient Mesoamerica are adversely affected by acidic precipitation,'' Dr. Robertson said in her report.</p>
        <p>Although some stones can be protected with chemical treatments, Dr. Lewin said, ''The only safe thing to do at this stage is to make copies of prized art objects and put the originals in a protected indoor environment.''</p>
        <p>This has been done with the statues that serve as the outer columns at the Parthenon in Athens. The statues, or caryatids, in place now are copies. The Michelangelo David on view in Florence is also a copy. The solution for the Maya treasures will not be as simple, archeologists said, because there could be no way to copy the grandeur of a Palenque or Chichen Itza.</p>
