        <p>LEAD: As economists and environmental scientists consider the drastic measures that will be required if the nation is to meet smog reduction goals, many are coming to a conclusion they would once have considered unthinkable: the effort may not be worth it.</p>
        <p>As economists and environmental scientists consider the drastic measures that will be required if the nation is to meet smog reduction goals, many are coming to a conclusion they would once have considered unthinkable: the effort may not be worth it.</p>
        <p>The problem is ozone, the major component of smog and an irritant to the lungs.</p>
        <p>Vehicles and industry produce about three-fourths of the 23 million tons of ozone-producing chemicals, mainly hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides, released each year in the United States, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. But scientists say the methods being used to control these sources will no longer produce big gains.</p>
        <p>Instead, the agency and independent scientists have concluded, efforts will have to focus on thousands of small sources, like solvents used to clean the home, gasoline-powered lawn mowers, starter fluids for backyard barbecues, hair sprays, windshield cleaners, even bakeries that emit alcohol vapors from yeast growing in bread dough. New Products, New Taxes</p>
        <p>Officials in Southern California, which has the nation's worst smog problem, announced last month that they would restrict such emissions, as well as force people to drive less.</p>
        <p>But for the country as a whole, E.P.A. scientists have concluded, such steps would be difficult to impose and enormously expensive, costing perhaps as much as $20 billion a year for things like new products, improvements in public transportation and new taxes. In Southern California, the tougher air-quality rules will force businesses to alter the items they sell and the ways they make them, or even to cease operations.  [ Page D1. ]  In contrast, said Alex Cristofaro, director of the atomospheric and economic analysis division at the E.P.A., acid rain could be controlled for $2.5 billion to $5 billion a year.</p>
        <p>''The environmental movement as a whole is increasingly coming to realize that we can no longer make major gains by forcing people to put widgets on smokestacks of plants.'' Mr. Cristofaro said. ''Most of the easy sources to control already have controls. To get significant reductions now means changing a number of behaviors and on such a scale that we can't do it without controlling legislation.'' 'Tradeoff With Ozone'</p>
        <p>Dr. Bernard Goldstein, director of the Environmental and Health Sciences Institute of Rutgers University, voiced a similar sentiment on further controls. ''You will be getting an improvement in health, but the question is, how much are you willing to tolerate to get it?''</p>
        <p>Experts are divided on that question, with some arguing that the standards should maintained, no matter how difficult to achieve, and others that they be less stringently enforced.</p>
        <p>The standards were established under the Clean Air Act, which sets levels of ozone and other pollutants to protect the health of people most sensitive to them.</p>
        <p>Dr. Goldstein said Congress must decide if it wants to keep the act as it now stands. ''The problem I see here is that Congress has not faced a decision about the tradeoff with ozone,'' he said, He said he thought that the California measures were ''Draconian'' but that they would be needed around the country to bring metropolitan areas in compliance with the Clean Air Act's ozone standards. Declining Air Quality Seen</p>
        <p>Richard E. Ayres, chairman of the National Clean Air Coalition in Washington, an alliance of consumer and public health groups, said he was ''flabbergasted'' that some would ask whether the ozone standard should be relaxed. ''I find it remarkable that they would even suggest it be relaxed,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The situation is particularly disturbing, said Mr. Ayres, because ''we have a combination of scientific findings saying that the standards need to be tighter and at the same time we have declining air quality.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ayres said he thought Americans would be willing to change some of their habits and some of the products they use in order to breathe cleaner air. ''Is it really true that we care so much about oil-based paints or the stuff under our sinks in pressurized cans? Is that important enough to us to threaten people's health? I don't think so.'' Common Chemicals</p>
        <p>Officials of the environmental agency say as many as 75 or 80 areas of the country have failed to meet Clean Air Act standards. To come into compliance, many of these areas will need to slash the hydrocarbons emitted into the atmosphere by at least 50 percent, said Tom Helms, chief of the agency's ozone and carbon monoxide programs. ''That is going to hit everybody hard,'' he said.</p>
        <p>While the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere is an essential shield against ultraviolet radiation, at ground level ozone is a pollutant that forms when hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides mix in the presence of sunlight, in a process not fully understood. These chemicals are in household cleaners, paints, dry-cleaning fluids and lighter fluid.</p>
        <p>In some cases, people might be able to use substitutes for the volatile chemicals. But in other cases, they may have to use less of the chemicals. E.P.A. officials said they doubted that people would make these changes voluntarily. Deadline Extended</p>
        <p>Milton Russell, an economist at the University of Tennessee who has studied the ozone problem, agreed that the cost of reducing ozone pollution may not be worth the benefits. ''What does this tell you about the goals of the Clean Air Act?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>Cities violate the Clean Air Act if they have more than 0.12 parts per million of ozone in their air for one hour at any time on any day of the year. About 120 cities did not meet this standard last year, said Christopher Rice, an E.P.A. spokesman.</p>
        <p>Cities that violated the ozone standard on three or more days in the preceding three years are not in compliance. Congress extended the deadline for compliance with the Clean Air Act until August 1988; the agency is now analyzing its data on ozone violations but is not yet certain what sanctions might be imposed. Voice for Lower Standards</p>
        <p>But an E.P.A. official, who asked not to be named, said he was coming to question whether it was worthwhile to control ozone as stringently as the Clean Air Act required. His views were echoed by other scientists in and out of the Government.</p>
        <p>On average, the E.P.A. official pointed out, regions that exceed the ozone standard exceed it on only nine days of the year.</p>
        <p>The ozone standard is based on studies showing adverse health effects in some people when they exercise in air with high ozone concentrations. ''How much of that disease is due to ozone?'' the official asked. ''The agency really doesn't know. But now we are talking of taking all the cleaning stuff that's under your kitchen sink and throwing it away.'' An Outdoor Problem</p>
        <p>Researchers have found that ozone can cause losses of as much as 20 percent in lung capacity and that these effects have occurred at ozone levels that are now found in places like the northeastern United States for days at a time in the summer, when atmospheric conditions favor ozone formation.</p>
        <p>Although the ozone damage to the lungs seems to go away within a week, animal experiments have shown that chronic exposure to high levels of ozone leads to permanent damage and premature aging of the lung.</p>
        <p>But ozone is an outdoor problem, so not everyone is exposed to it all the time. And certain people are much more vulnerable to its effects than others. Children are sensitive to ozone, as are people who exercise outdoors on smoggy days, drawing air deeply into their lungs. No Easy Answer</p>
        <p>The Clean Air Act stipulates, however, that standards be set to protect the health of the most sensitive members of the population.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cristofaro said the E.P.A. was studying the feasibility of seeking legislation to impose fees or taxes on some of the thousands of contributors to ozone pollution. For example, the agency could tax certain solvents in paints used by auto body shops.</p>
        <p>But no one thinks there will be any easy answers as the nation confronts the next phase of its efforts to clean up the air.</p>
        <p>With the high cost and the substantial inconvenience of bringing metropolitan areas into compliance with the ozone standard, Mr. Cristofaro said, ''we should look very closely at what we get for it.''</p>
