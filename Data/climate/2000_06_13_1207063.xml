        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>MONTENEGRO: SPLIT VICTORY -- Both the government and the pro-Serbian opposition were able to claim victory in local elections. President Milo Djukanovic, left, welcomed the government coalition's win in the capital, Podgorica, as proof that ''Montenegro is marching on a stable, democratic, reformist path.'' But the pro-Belgrade opposition, led by the Yugoslav prime minister, Momir Bulatovic, won in the town of Herceg Novi in a show of support for President Slobodan Milosevic.</p>

        <p>BRITAIN: FOX HUNTING BILL -- The Government announced that it would make legislation prohibiting fox hunting with hounds a government priority in Parliament, where surveys show widespread opposition to the practice. The action, permitting a free vote on a series of options ranging from no ban to a full ban, guarantees passage by the House of Commons and will help the bill overcome expected opposition in the House of Lords. The bill will be introduced this fall.</p>

        <p>NORTHERN IRELAND: CHARLES SKIPS A TOWN -- Prince Charles visited Northern Ireland but did not carry out a planned engagement in Londonderry because of a continuing inquiry into the 1972 ''Bloody Sunday'' massacre in which 14 people were shot dead by members of the parachute regiment of which he is colonel in chief.</p>
        <p>Warren Hoge (NYT)</p>
        <p>IRELAND: CORRUPTION ATTACK -- President Mary McAleese criticized the culture of corruption that she said was jeopardizing Ireland's prosperity, and said corruption investigations among politicians were revealing the ''sordid side of the country's secret life.'' Ms. McAleese, whose role is largely ceremonial and diplomatic, said failed leadership had ''contaminated the wells of hope that we draw from.''</p>
        <p>Brian Lavery (NYT)</p>
        <p>THE AMERICAS</p>
        <p>CANADA: PROTESTS IN CALGARY -- In downtown Calgary, 200 people peacefully protested the World Petroleum Congress, which had just opened in Canada's energy capital, drawing almost 3,000 delegates from 95 countries. On Sunday about 1,500 people demonstrated, also peacefully, against global warming and sport utility vehicles as well.</p>
        <p>James Brooke (NYT)</p>
        <p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
        <p>ISRAEL: BARAK TALKS CONTINUE -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak continued to negotiate with political parties to reconstitute his government. He did not follow up on a threat to dismiss ministers who voted against the government for early elections, and they did not quit as threatened. In the midst of the talks, Shas Party ministers charged that other ministers who portrayed them as extortionist for demanding more money for their indebted school system were using ''Nazi techniques.'' That caused a storm.</p>
        <p>Deborah Sontag (NYT)</p>
        <p>ISRAEL: DIAMOND BAN -- The Israel Diamond Exchange said it would expel any member who ''knowingly trades'' in diamonds from rebel movements in Angola, Sierra Leone and Congo. The exchange, in Ramat Gan, outside Tel Aviv, supervises the importation and re-exportation of diamonds, Israel's largest foreign trade item. Expulsion would ban a diamond trader from conducting business in Israel and in 23 other recognized diamond exchanges around the world, the organization said.</p>

        <p>ISRAEL: SWITCHING PRESSES -- With striking printers shutting its presses near Tel Aviv, the daily Yediot Ahronot has been publishing sections of the paper in the Palestinian-ruled West Bank, a rival newspaper, Haaretz, reported. The paper is said to be using presses in Ramallah owned by Al Iyam, a Palestinian daily close to Yasir Arafat.</p>
        <p>William A. Orme Jr. (NYT)</p>
        <p>IRAN: REFORMISTS AND PRESS -- In a bid to fulfill promises that helped them win parliamentary elections, more than 100 reformist legislators have drafted a bill calling for lifting curbs on the news media imposed by their predecessors, a journalist and leading reformist lawmaker said. Rajabali Mazrouie added that no date had been set for introducing the bill, which would be the reformists' first legislative sign of change.</p>
        <p>(AP)</p>
        <p>UNITED NATIONS</p>
        <p>AMERICAN'S PALESTINIAN ROLE -- An American with nearly two decades of experience with the United Nations high commissioner for refugees has been named appointed director of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, an organization that provides education and health care for 3.6 million Palestinian refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank and Gaza. Karen Koning AbuZayd, who has most recently directed refugee work in the United States and the Caribbean, will be based in Gaza.</p>
        <p>Barbara Crossette (NYT)</p>
        <p>POVERTY AMONG THE RICH -- Unicef says in a new report that nearly one in six children in the world's richest nations lives in poverty. Britain, Italy, the United States and Mexico ranked at the bottom of the 29 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, when ''relative'' poverty was measured, defined as households earning below 50 percent of the national median income.</p>
        <p>Barbara Crossette (NYT)</p>
        <p>AFRICA</p>
        <p>NIGERIA: PRESIDENTIAL APOLOGY -- President Olusegun Obasanjo apologized for not consulting widely on sharp increases in gasoline prices on June 1 that have plunged Nigeria into a general strike. The government appeared desperate to end the strike, and analysts saw the dramatic apology as preparing Nigerians for a reversal of the widely unpopular increases, a result of the ending of government subsidies.</p>
        <p>(Reuters)</p>
        <p>ASIA</p>
        <p>INDONESIA: NEW CLASHES KILL 8 -- At least eight people, including two police officers, were killed in new Muslim-Christian fighting in the eastern province of Maluku, officials and witnesses said. In the provincial capital of Ambon, an official at the main mosque said four Muslims were killed in a clash with a Christian gang at Hative Kecil, a village near the city. Witnesses said two Christians also died.</p>
