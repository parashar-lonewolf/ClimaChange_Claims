        <p>LEAD: President Bush traveled on the West Coast today, raising campaign money and skirting two conservation issues that have complicated his effort to find new political ground on the environment.</p>
        <p>President Bush traveled on the West Coast today, raising campaign money and skirting two conservation issues that have complicated his effort to find new political ground on the environment.</p>
        <p>In Portland, Ore., Mr. Bush offered his familiar "find-a-balance" formula to environmentalists and to Republican politicians and timber industry executives. They have been at odds over proposed restrictions to logging on millions of acres; environmentalists say the restrictions are needed to protect the Northern spotted owl from extinction, and opponents say they would wipe out thousands of jobs in logging communities.</p>
        <p>In his public comments, the President seemed to lean slightly more toward those who argue that economic considerations outweigh the need to protect the owls. But he carefully avoided taking any clear position before June 23, when the United States Fish and Wildlife Service is to rule on whether the owl will be protected under the Endangered Species Act.</p>
        <p>"I'm interested in the owl," he said, "but I'm also interested in jobs for the American family."</p>
        <p>Debate Over Offshore Oil</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush also stayed away from discussion of offshore oil drilling while in Los Angeles, where debate over exploration for oil along the coast has been a major political issue for him since the 1988 Presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has come under mounting pressure from environmental and industry groups to announce a policy on Federal oil leasing off California and Florida, and promised last week to announce a decision within days. But White House aides made it clear in advance that the President was not going to use this trip to do so. Instead, he attended a Republican fund-raising event at a Bel Air mansion, where participants paid $15,000 to $25,000 a plate.</p>
        <p>The day reflected Mr. Bush's grappling with environmental issues in the 16 months since he took office. While the President has earned praise from environmentalists for proposing revisions to the Clean Air Act to reduce acid rain, he has tempered his avowals of support for environmental causes by saying they must be balanced with economic concerns.</p>
        <p>'Save Every Subspecies?'</p>
        <p>The Administration's recent handling of the protection of endangered species has been typical of this approach. Last week the White House rejected a suggestion by Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. that the Endangered Species Act be revised to take economic considerations into account.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush's comments in Portland seemed to reflect Mr. Lujan's notion. "I want to be known as the environmental President," he said, "but I also want to be concerned about a person's ability to hold a job."</p>
        <p>In making his suggestion, Mr. Lujan also commented on a debate over whether to allow construction of an observatory in Arizona that environmentalists say will cause the extinction of a subspecies of squirrel, the Mount Graham red squirrel. "Do we have to save every subspecies?" he asked.</p>
        <p>That argument had strong resonance in Oregon's debate over the Northern spotted owl, a subspecies of the spotted owl that lives in dense older forests in the Pacific Northwest. As loggers thin those forests, the owl becomes easier prey to the great horned owl. Last month an interagency commission recommended that logging be banned on 8.4 million acres of forest in Washington, Oregon and Northern California to protect the spotted owl.</p>
        <p>No action can be taken until the Fish and Wildlife Service determines whether the spotted owl is a "threatened" or "endangered" species under the law. After that, the Administration and Congress would have to agree on a way to save the owl.</p>
        <p>'A Passive Kind of Owl'</p>
        <p>Some opponents of a logging ban have echoed Mr. Lujan's arguments. "There are millions of owls in the world," said Representative Denny Smith, an Oregon Republican. "This little puppy just happens to be a passive kind of owl that's being run over by the great horned owl."</p>
        <p>While Mr. Bush was in Portland on Sunday and today, Mr. Smith and others put pressure on him to take a stand on the dispute. Instead, he offered his split-the-difference formula.</p>
        <p>Today, at a fund-raising breakfast for David Frohnmayer, the Republican candidate for governor in Oregon, Mr. Bush drew loud applause when he said: "I reject those who would ignore the economic consequences of the spotted owl decision. The jobs of many thousands of Oregonians and whole communities are at stake."</p>
        <p>Then he added a sentence that left his audience silent but cheered some of the two dozen protesters who stood outside. "But I also think that we ought to reject those who do not recognize their obligation to protect our delicate ecosystem," he said.</p>
        <p>"Common sense tells us to find a needed balance," he said in conclusion. "Together, I'm convinced we can work to find that balance."</p>
