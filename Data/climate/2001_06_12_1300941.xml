        <p>President Bush's five-day trip to Europe this week is shaping up as an important test of his foreign affairs leadership. It is the first major journey abroad for one of our least-traveled modern presidents, and could thus give him a fuller and firsthand understanding of the leaders and issues animating the European Continent. It also comes at a time when European leaders are distressed by the administration's early go-it-alone style on issues ranging from missile defense planning to the Kyoto treaty on global warming.</p>
        <p>In a week that will include meetings with top NATO officials, a summit conference with leaders of the 15 European Union nations and an initial get-together with Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, Mr. Bush needs to set a steady, productive course for trans-Atlantic relations. That will require commitment to genuine consultation and cooperation with Europe on nuclear weapons strategy, missile defenses, relations with Russia, creation of a European defense force and environmental issues.</p>

        <p>President Bush's five-day trip to Europe this week is shaping up as an important test of his foreign affairs leadership. It is the first major journey abroad for one of our least-traveled modern presidents, and could thus give him a fuller and firsthand understanding of the leaders and issues animating the European Continent. It also comes at a time when European leaders are distressed by the administration's early go-it-alone style on issues ranging from missile defense planning to the Kyoto treaty on global warming.</p>
        <p>In a week that will include meetings with top NATO officials, a summit conference with leaders of the 15 European Union nations and an initial get-together with Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, Mr. Bush needs to set a steady, productive course for trans-Atlantic relations. That will require commitment to genuine consultation and cooperation with Europe on nuclear weapons strategy, missile defenses, relations with Russia, creation of a European defense force and environmental issues.</p>
        <p>Europeans have also been confused by the conflicting policy visions articulated by Secretary of State Colin Powell and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld on their recent trips to the Continent. The contrast between Secretary Powell's assurances of serious consultation on mutual security issues and Mr. Rumsfeld's exhortations to fall in line behind Washington's nuclear leadership have left European leaders wondering who really speaks for this administration. Mr. Bush needs to make clear that he stands behind General Powell's wiser approach.</p>
        <p>In its first months, the Bush administration has clearly signaled its intention to break with Clinton administration policies on arms control and the environment. But it has largely neglected the kind of consultations with allies and Congressional Democrats that will be needed to win support for alternate approaches. With the Senate now under Democratic leadership, Mr. Bush will be obliged to pay more attention to his domestic critics. He needs to be similarly attentive to restive allies.</p>
        <p>Europe is understandably concerned by Mr. Rumsfeld's calls for Washington to abandon the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty with Russia to allow broader testing and early construction of a defensive missile shield. Such haste could unravel the whole structure of existing arms control treaties. It makes far more sense to continue abiding by the ABM treaty while trying to negotiate a new agreement with Moscow permitting limited missile defenses. With no technology that can reliably shoot down enemy missiles yet available, there is no compelling need to cast off the ABM treaty now.</p>
        <p>European leaders are also dismayed at Mr. Bush's overly passive approach to global warming. They could not have been pleased by his comments yesterday. He displayed a more nuanced grasp of the issue than he had before, and Europe could take some comfort from his pledge to assume a ''leadership role'' in seeking a global solution. But he committed the United States to little more than further study of a problem that has already been extensively researched. If anything, he was more critical of the Kyoto accord on global warming than when he renounced it in March. Regrettably, he showed no signs of reviving his campaign pledge to impose caps on emissions of carbon dioxide, the main global warming gas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush needs to listen carefully to the concerns of European leaders on these and other issues and recognize that American leadership is most effective when exercised in concert with Europe, not in opposition to it.</p>
