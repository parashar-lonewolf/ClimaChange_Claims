        <p>When you squeeze things hard enough, or change their temperatures drastically enough, or both, wondrous changes occur -- seemingly magical transformations that have hooked more than a few people on the joys of science.</p>
        <p>Take oxygen.</p>
        <p>We all know that oxygen is a colorless, odorless gas, as invisible to the eye as it is essential to human respiration. But a team of physicists at the European Laboratory for Nonlinear Spectroscopy in Florence, Italy, has reported on a new form of oxygen called epsilon-phase O4 . Wonder of wonders, this stuff -- pure oxygen -- is a blood-red solid!</p>
        <p>Exotic substances like epsilon-phase O4  are never easy to make. In this case, you need two large, gem-quality diamonds with apexes pointed at each other and nearly touching, and with the space between them encircled by a metal gasket. This arrangement creates a tiny sealed chamber in which the pressure rises astronomically when a vise squeezes the diamonds together.</p>
        <p>When a minute puff of oxygen is compressed in this diamond anvil to a pressure of about 100,000 times that of the atmosphere, red oxygen materializes. The Italian team believes the material is a peculiar molecular configuration of oxygen, made of rectangular units with an oxygen atom at each of the four corners. The ordinary oxygen in air is a molecule containing two oxygen atoms; another form, ozone, contains three oxygen atoms.</p>
        <p>The higher the pressure goes, the redder it gets -- up to a point. As the pressure nears one million atmospheres, another astonishing transformation occurs: oxygen becomes a metal; that is, it becomes capable of conducting electricity.</p>
        <p>And as if that were not amazing enough, oxygen compressed further and chilled to near the absolute zero of temperature was shown last year by a Japanese team to be a superconductor: a substance that conducts electricity with no resistance.</p>
        <p>I remember the thrill as a high school student a half-century ago when I first beheld liquid air pouring into a dish from a kind of thermos bottle called a Dewar. Ordinary air is invisible, and this frigid liquid form, tinted a faint blue, seemed like a ghost materialized from the ether -- a dangerous ghost that boiled malignantly and swiftly coated its container with thick white frost.</p>
        <p>A rose dipped into this sinister liquid instantly became as fragile as a Christmas tree ornament, and a rubber ball briefly immersed in it shattered when dropped.</p>
        <p>The founder of modern chemistry, Antoine Laurent Lavoisier, was fascinated by the notion of liquefied gases, even though he never saw one -- he died on the guillotine in 1794, before the feat had been achieved. But according to a recent biography, ''Absolute Zero and the Conquest of Cold,'' by Tom Schachtman, Lavoisier wrote at one point, in a prescient surmise, that in very cold regions of the solar system, ''the water of our rivers and oceans would be changed into solid mountains. The air, or at least some of its constituents, would cease to remain an invisible gas and would turn into the liquid state. A transformation of this kind would thus produce new liquids of which we as yet have no idea.''</p>
        <p>Changes in pressure are important for converting gases into liquids or solids. One way to make a gas cold enough to liquefy is to first compress it and then remove the heat created by compression. After that, when the pressure is quickly released, the gas instantly cools. Using this and other methods, including the evaporation and dilution of liquids, physicists have reached temperatures within one-billionth of a degree above the absolute zero (which is approximately minus 459.67 degrees on the Fahrenheit scale).</p>
        <p>Nearly all gases, including hydrogen, the lightest and simplest of all substances, freeze solid well above this temperature. The sole exception to this rule is helium, which can never freeze solid at any temperature.</p>
        <p>But a version of liquid helium that exists at temperatures below 2.17 degrees Celsius above absolute zero does something astonishing: it becomes a ''superfluid'' that can flow without any resistance through even the finest hole.</p>
        <p>It behaves in strange ways. Superfluid helium contained in a beaker creeps up the inside of the glass, climbs over the rim, descends on the outside and drips off the bottom of the container. It looks like magic.</p>
        <p>Liquid helium, moreover, can act as a window into the microscopic world ruled by the laws of quantum mechanics.</p>
        <p>When ordinary liquids are swirled they form a vortex, like that of water entering a bathtub drain. The more vigorous the swirling, the more pronounced is the vortex. But superfluid helium is different.</p>
        <p>When it is swirled a little, one vortex forms, but when swirled a little harder, two vortices abruptly appear, and then three, and so on. It is a quantum fluid that changes states in sharp quantum steps rather than in the smooth progression we see in the everyday world.</p>
        <p>Liquid helium is expensive and hard to handle, but dry ice -- the solid form of carbon dioxide -- is commonly used to ship ice cream, and can offer some fun. The temperature of a block of dry ice is no higher than minus 108 degrees Fahrenheit, and when dry ice is lowered into a beaker of acetone, the acetone is quickly chilled. A flower dipped into it becomes as brittle as glass, and liquid mercury becomes a silvery solid hard enough to hammer nails. (But bear in mind that acetone is a dangerous solvent and mercury is poisonous.)</p>
        <p>People have learned to squeeze things so hard that their molecular structure changes drastically. In the early 1950's engineers learned to squeeze graphite hard enough to turn it into diamond -- mostly in the form of industrial abrasives, but also into costly gems.</p>
        <p>Scientists will probably never attain the kind of pressure that creates neutron stars, in which atoms are literally crushed to a matter so dense that just a spoon of it would weigh thousands of tons, if it could be brought to Earth.</p>
        <p>But by firing metal plugs at targets using special gas guns, scientists have generated brief pulses of enormous pressure -- the kind of pressure that exists deep in the interior of giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn. With the help of gas guns, astrophysicists are deciphering the high-pressure structures of the solar system. For example, about 90 percent of Jupiter's mass is hydrogen, most of which is under such enormous pressure that it exists as a liquid metal. The circulation of this metallic hydrogen is believed to be the dynamo powering the planet's gigantic magnetic field.</p>
        <p>Scientists will never cease pushing the limits of pressure and temperature they can achieve, because surprises await each advance. Also, there's nothing so stimulating to the creative juices as trying to imagine something that no one has ever seen.</p>
