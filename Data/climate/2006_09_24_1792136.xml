        <p>CREATIONISTS</p>
        <p>Selected Essays, 1993-2006.</p>
        <p>By E. L. Doctorow.</p>
        <p>176 pp. Random House. $24.95.</p>
        <p>In this luminous, slyly titled collection of literary musings, E. L. Doctorow gives us compacted worlds, fissioning into ever larger worlds, of imaginative possibility. This should hardly surprise anyone who knows Doctorow's own literature. Those who regard him more selectively -- as leftist beau saboteur in political debate, as scourge of patriotic moms 'n' dads at suburban commencement podiums -- may be more astonished: Doctorow treats the dozen-odd authors under his scrutiny with unwavering respect. Not a single ''worst writer of his generation'' meets his comeuppance here. And yet (oh, let's be frank: and therefore) ''Creationists'' sustains a pitch of fascination, borne on a cascade of glittering aphorism, rarely encountered in the unforgiving genre of literary criticism.</p>
        <p>Doctorow offers no apologies for the charm. His subjects, all summoned rather pointedly from the past, ''do have a certain radiance in my eyes,'' he happily admits early on, adding, ''underlying all my attentions is a collegial homage, a sympathy, even a love for the aesthetic struggle as it shines with a kind of blessedness.'' Edgar Allan Poe (the worst writer of his, etc.) may Nevermore see this bounty of slack cut him.</p>
        <p>By shrugging aside the grim duties of the lit-cop, Doctorow is free to open a door seldom available to the nonspecialized reader. He escorts us through it into the deep thought-realms of the Working Writer as she struggles with the infinite possibilities, and perils, of choosing the next word, the next plot turn, the next confrontation with her own inevitably flawed but extraordinary muse. Poe, for example, is ''a genius hack,'' who transcended his limited genre by pouring ''the universal dread of existence'' into his dreamlike gothic fiction. Helpless against that genius, Poe ''knew what he was doing, and didn't know at the same time. He is an allegory for all literary life.''</p>
        <p>Doctorow chose his gallery with what may seem a generous dash of whimsy. Many of his writers and other ''creationists'' are not exactly habitués of the canon. Standing alongside the likes of Mark Twain, Sinclair Lewis, Scott Fitzgerald and John Dos Passos are Harriet Beecher Stowe; W. G. Sebald; the anonymous translators of Genesis into the King James version; Harpo Marx; Albert Einstein; the makers of the atomic bomb. (These final auteurs, he seems to be suggesting in this least congruent of the essays, carried the concept of magic realism a tad too far.)</p>
        <p>And yet the writers assembled here efficiently serve the critic's intentions. Each yields in robustly illustrative ways to ''the voice of the book,'' a voice more protean than the artist's own; a voice that soars into conjunction with the voice of the region, the nation, the times. ''Fitzgerald writes with clinical precision. ... He consistently offers the insights of a first-rate cultural historian.'' Sinclair Lewis was fueled by ''an obsessive detestation of American provincial life''; his booster-monster George F. Babbitt was nothing less than the replacement for Tom Sawyer as ''carrier of our national soul.'' Stowe, in her descriptive letters and even in her own unacknowledged racism, became a ''more or less inadvertent chronicler of the new 'national culture.' '' There were two Hemingways: the partisan deeply engaged with the Spanish Civil War, and the detached writer, ''there to gather the materials for a book.'' His ''notion that we are the self-reliant independent entrepreneurs of ourselves is a national heritage.''</p>
        <p>The primacy of text over author is of course a founding tenet of the New Criticism that formed Doctorow's writerly values -- he was a protégé of John Crowe Ransom at Kenyon College in the early 1950's. Reinforcing that approach -- visible in Doctorow's meticulously inductive construction, and in his affable indifference to polemic -- is an even earlier influence, the Bronx High School of Science, which Doctorow attended in the 1940's. ''Underlying everything -- the evocative flashes, the dogged working of language -- is the writer's belief in the story as a system of knowledge,'' he writes. ''This belief is akin to the scientist's faith in the scientific method as a way to truth.''</p>
        <p>But the author of ''The March'' is after something larger and more subtle, in these examinations, than a reaffirmation of the old isms. Nowhere are his aims more vividly suggested than in the collection's centerpiece, ''Composing 'Moby-Dick': What Might Have Happened.''</p>
        <p>Declaring a ''personal relationship'' with Melville, and remarking his surprise that ''I've realized how much of my own work, at its own level, hears Melville, ... endorses his double-dipping into the accounts of realism and allegory,'' Doctorow mounts nothing less audacious than a parallel voyage with the author's mind and motives as Melville proceeds with his epic. He supposes that at Chapter 20, the end of Ishmael's land-based wanderings, Melville paused, perhaps in despair, ''to read what he had written to see what his book was bidding him to do.'' The book, it seems, wanted him to notice its polymath logorrheic narrator: a narrator so infinitely bountiful in knowledge and prophecy that his talk could square up to the necessary vastness of the seaborne chase and battle that lay ahead. Melville's big gamble, then, was ''to pass the time by destroying it, to make a new thing of the novel form by blasting its conventions.'' Excess? ''It is indisputable in my mind that excess in literature is its own justification. ... In this case it turns the world on its head,'' and ''transformative as a consistent recourse ... persuades the reader finally into the realm so nakedly proselytized.''</p>
        <p>Melville was, in short, a creationist. Responding to a voice -- a voice that emerged from beyond his own mundane reasonings, he created a world.</p>
        <p>Which brings us back to Doctorow's sly title and gentle, reasoning tone. In the world Doctorow beholds in the twilight of his career, a polarized world gone delirious with anger and irrationality, perhaps a reconciliation can be made. Perhaps science (the secular) and that inexplicable leap of creation arising from within oneself (the numinous) might be conjoined in life, as in art, to restore a measure of hope against the unknowable rising sea. As Doctorow reminds us -- again, slyly -- ''all creationists are mortal.''</p>
