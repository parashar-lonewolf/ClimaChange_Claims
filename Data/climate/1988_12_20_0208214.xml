        <p>NEW archeological findings show that humans first occupied Cyprus as long ago as 8200 B.C., about 1,000 years earlier than had been thought. The discovery, scientists said, raises the possibility that human hunting, not climate change, brought about the extinction of the pygmy hippopotamus on the Mediterranean island.</p>
        <p>Judging by fossilized remains, pygmy hippos once roamed the island in great numbers. An adult, about two and a half feet tall at the shoulder, was no larger than a St. Bernard dog. The hippos shared the island with the rarer pygmy elephant, which was about four feet tall at the shoulder. It was assumed that the pygmy hippo and elephant had disappeared long before the arrival of humans.</p>
        <p>Alan H. Simmons of the Desert Research Institute at the University of Nevada in Reno reported collecting hippo bones mixed with 64 chipped-stone artifacts at an ancient rock shelter. Many of the bones had been burned and some showed marks indicating that the animals had been butchered with the stone tools.</p>
