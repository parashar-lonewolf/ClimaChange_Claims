        <p>LEAD: The United States accused some European countries and industrial concerns today of seeking to delay effective measures to protect the earth's ozone layer from destructive industrial chemicals, as a conference on the ozone threat ended without substantial movement toward an agreement.</p>
        <p>The United States accused some European countries and industrial concerns today of seeking to delay effective measures to protect the earth's ozone layer from destructive industrial chemicals, as a conference on the ozone threat ended without substantial movement toward an agreement.</p>
        <p>Ambassador Richard Elliot Benedick, the leader of the American delegation to the 30-nation conference, said, ''Some participants at these negotiations seem to be concentrating more on short-term profits than on our common responsibility to conserve the environment for future generations.''</p>
        <p>The five-day meeting, sponsored by the United Nations Environment Program, ended without serious progress on a protocol to restrict the use of chlorofluorocarbons, known as CFC's, and other compounds that deplete the ozone layer. Chemicals Are Widely Used</p>
        <p>The stratospheric ozone layer shields life on earth from dangerous ultraviolet radiation. The industrial chemicals that destructively interact with ozone are used as solvents, and in aerosol sprays, refrigerants, plastic foams and fire extinguishers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Benedick, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for the Environment, Health and Natural Resources, was the only delegation leader to hold a news conference. He took the floor after the conference chairman, Ambassador Winfried Lang of Austria, presented a briefing emphasizing the positive aspects of what he called ''a very difficult, but also very frank'' meeting.</p>
        <p>''The United States is not as optimistic as the chairman,'' Mr. Benedick said. ''Unfortunately, after two difficult sessions in Geneva last December and this week in Vienna, the hardest work still remains to be done.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately also, it was evident that a few countries and a few representatives from European chemical industries appear content to see these negotiations drag on inconclusively and to have effective international measures postponed far into the future.'' European Differences Cited</p>
        <p>Mr. Benedick expressed concern that the European Community, the second-biggest producer and user of CFC's and the leading exporter, ''probably because of internal differences among member countries, was still not in a position to negotiate officially.''</p>
        <p>The American official did not identify the countries that are at odds on the issue, but the West German delegation made it clear that its position was close to that of the United States, and that Britain stood at the other extreme.</p>
        <p>British delegates declined to define their country's stance and stressed that the community had not reached a common position, as its rules require in such negotiations. Heinrich W. Kraus, a German delegate, said that Bonn had pressed at periodic meetings of European environment ministers for a joint stance closer to the United States' and that it would continue to do so.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lang said he envisioned a protocol freezing production at the 1986 level and a 20 percent reduction of output within three years of signing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Benedick, however, termed a 20 percent reduction ''totally unacceptable'' and ''simply ridiculous.'' In his opening address Monday, he said an immediate reduction in CFC use of 85 percent would be required merely to hold the chemicals at their current volume in the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>West Germany, which with the Netherlands and Denmark represents the most active environmental interests in the community, is prepared to seek a 50 percent reduction, Mr. Kraus said.</p>
