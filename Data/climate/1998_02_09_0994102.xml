      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>SURELY the comfort value of a bowl of hot soup, even if it comes out of a can, is not a new concept to most of television-watching America. But how about the comfort value of a bowl of hot soup served to a foster child who has just watched her social worker drive off, leaving her in an unfamiliar new home?</p>
        <p>With that kind of jolt, the Campbell Soup Company is trying to graft a contemporary edge onto its image in a pair of television commercials scheduled to begin running tomorrow during the Winter Olympics. Known for trading on its iconic, homespun image in previous campaigns, Campbell this time seems determined to prove it understands modern life, particularly family life in all its fin-de-siecle permutations.</p>

        <p>SURELY the comfort value of a bowl of hot soup, even if it comes out of a can, is not a new concept to most of television-watching America. But how about the comfort value of a bowl of hot soup served to a foster child who has just watched her social worker drive off, leaving her in an unfamiliar new home?</p>
        <p>With that kind of jolt, the Campbell Soup Company is trying to graft a contemporary edge onto its image in a pair of television commercials scheduled to begin running tomorrow during the Winter Olympics. Known for trading on its iconic, homespun image in previous campaigns, Campbell this time seems determined to prove it understands modern life, particularly family life in all its fin-de-siecle permutations.</p>
        <p>Campbell is also departing from past practice of featuring one variety of soup -- chicken noodle, tomato -- in each commercial, in favor of an overarching brand image pitch. And it is a pitch that both echoes the past and somewhat hubristically points to the future: ''M'm! m'm! good for the body, good for the soul.''</p>
        <p>Such a theme is meant to connote both the physical and the emotional rewards of consuming soup, said Phil Dusenberry, the vice chairman of BBDO Worldwide in New York, the Omnicom Group unit that created the campaign. Mr. Dusenberry also created the ''Pepsi generation'' campaign for Pepsico, where Campbell's new chief executive, Dale F. Morrison, formerly worked.</p>
        <p>''We think the soul piece is a nice modern way of going beyond just the nourishing aspects of soup and talking in a contemporary sort of way about the nurturing aspects,'' Mr. Morrison said.</p>
        <p>Still, others may have different reactions. ''Soul is one of the most overextended theological terms in the present vocabulary, and I'm not surprised it's gone all the way to soup,'' said Forrest Church, the pastor of All Souls Church in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Emotions, which lend certain qualities to the soul, play a major role in the 60-second spots that have been completed so far. In the foster-child commercial, there is the anguished look the new mother gives the social worker, the painful disconnect of the child, the memories of home -- the vanished mother -- that are stirred up when the bowl of chicken noodle soup appears on a tray. (There are also plenty of shots of the soup, both in the can and out.)</p>
        <p>''My mommy used to fix me this soup,'' the little girl says. The foster mother replies: ''My mother used to make it for me, too. Why don't I tell you about my mom, and then you can tell me about yours?''</p>
        <p>The little girl chirps, ''O.K.''</p>
        <p>Viewers who may be left wondering what happened to land the child in foster care need not conclude that abuse had anything to do with it, Mr. Morrison said. ''It could be the parents died,'' he said. ''It could be a lot of things. It's a young girl with a new mom, and all of the trauma and emotion that goes around that.''</p>
        <p>The second, much more lighthearted spot shows six young children from two families who are plotting to get their single parents to marry each other, a la ''The Brady Bunch.''</p>
        <p>To get things rolling, the children decide to cook a romantic dinner, which turns out to be Chicken Parisienne, a recipe they find on the Campbell World Wide Web site (www.campbellsoup.com) that requires one can of Campbell's cream of chicken soup. The message is threefold: soup can become dinner, even for grown-ups; such recipes are incredibly easy; this company has thought of everything, as long as you have a home computer with access to the Web.</p>
        <p>''We're excited about the advertising in that it's part of a multifaceted plan we have to accelerate our top-line growth,'' said Mr. Morrison, who has made satisfying both Main Street and Wall Street his personal motto, and plans to double the company's ad budget, which is $130 million at present for soup. ''We want to have a growth profile that is more like Coca-Cola and Gillette.''</p>
        <p>That might be a tall order, one food industry analyst said.</p>
        <p>''Total category tonnage remains very sluggish, suggesting that people don't have time for soup, or maybe it's something your mother used to make for you,'' said John McMillin at Prudential Securities. ''You can blame global warming, but industry soup volumes haven't grown in five years.''</p>
        <p>The most recent data from IRI, which tracks product sales in supermarkets, shows Campbell's sales fell by 1.1 percent in the 52-week period that ended in November, Mr. McMillin said. The company has a 74 percent share of the $3.6 billion canned-soup business, dwarfing competitors like Pillsbury, a unit of Diageo P.L.C., which owns Progresso, and the H. J. Heinz Company.</p>
