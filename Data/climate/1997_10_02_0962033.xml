        <p>Crisis Over Budget Cuts in Italy  Italy's Communist party threw the Government into crisis by announcing that it would oppose a budget bill calling for further cuts in health care and pensions. The stance threatened Prime Minister Romano Prodi's center-left parliamentary majority as well as its efforts to tame Italy's finances and qualify for a single European currency.</p>

        <p>Paris Applies New Smog Law  Half the cars in the Paris area were ordered off the road as the city applied tough anti-smog laws for the first time. The Metro and other public transport were free and schools were told to teach about pollution instead of holding gym class. Critics called the surprise move undignified. The laws had been in place since early this year, but never applied.</p>

        <p>French Decline NATO Role  France announced that it would not rejoin the NATO military command structure later this year because the United States was not ready to let a European officer take over the Southern Command in Naples. The post, which includes the U.S. Sixth Fleet, has always been held by an American.</p>

        <p>Russia's Murky Privatization  The Moscow prosecutor's office said it was investigating whether a large book advance paid to Russia's former privatization chief, Alfred Kokh, was a quid pro quo for helping a bank gain control of a recently privatized telecommunications firm. Mr. Kokh is a close friend both of the bank's head and of one of President Boris N. Yeltsin's free-market advocates, Anatoly Chubais.</p>

        <p>NATO Seizes pro-Karadzic TV  NATO troops seized four television transmitters in Bosnia, ending broadcasts by Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic's party after it refused to end attacks against the peacekeeping force. The operation was carried out in Pale after repeated warnings to the Bosnian Serbs to end their propaganda campaign against NATO and a United Nations war crimes tribunal.</p>

        <p>Swiss Guard Is Cleared  Swiss authorities dropped a criminal investigation against a former security guard, Christoph Meili, who earlier this year saved Holocaust-era bank documents from being destroyed. Mr. Meili and his family became permanent residents of the United States on Monday after receiving threats in Switzerland. Zurich authorities also said they would end investigations against the bank's chief archivist, who had released the documents for shredding.</p>

        <p>Democratic Party Evaded Campaign Spending Limits  The Democratic National Committee quietly transferred at least $32 million to state Democratic parties in the last election as part of an elaborate plan to spend more money than Federal election law appeared to allow on a massive advertising campaign that indirectly helped re-elect President Clinton .</p>

        <p>Weathermen Visit White House  President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore invited more than 100 national and local television forecasters to the White House for briefings on climate change from Government experts. The Administration hopes that the forecasters will influence public opinion on climate change and global warming more than news reports, which Clinton aides complain pay scant attention to the issue.</p>

        <p>Senate Drops Landrieu Inquiry  A Senate committee voted unanimously to drop its inquiry into the election of Senator Mary L. Landrieu, following months of partisan wrangling, hundreds of thousands of dollars spent for the investigation and a foray into the picaresque world of Louisiana politics.</p>

        <p>Arts Endowment Survives  The National Endowment for the Arts survived its annual Congressional ordeal with only modest overall cuts in funding, but officials said new restrictions will mean drastic cuts in aid for New York State, always its biggest beneficiary.</p>

        <p>AIDS Experiments Defended  Two of the Government's top health officials have issued a pointed defense of controversial experiments on H.I.V.-infected pregnant women in the third world, saying that the studies adhere to international principles of ethics and that they ''address an urgent need in the countries in which they are being conducted.''</p>

        <p>Astronauts Make Spacewalk  An American and a Russian from the space shuttle Atlantis conducted a space walk as the craft was docked at the Russian space station Mir. The two men retrieved flypaper-like panels covered with cosmic lint and dings from micrometeorites.</p>

        <p>Agreement on Airport Rail Plan  Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki have agreed on a scaled-down connection to Kennedy International Airport from the Jamaica train station, both officials announced. The 8.4-mile project is about a quarter the price of a proposed 22-mile railway linking Manhattan, Kennedy and La Guardia airports that was deemed too costly in 1995, one of 21 proposals that have stalled over 30 years.</p>

        <p>Mayor Unveils Drug Program  Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, announcing a series of anti-drug measures that he hopes to make the hallmark of a second term, said he would expand the Police Department's anti-drug initiatives into Queens and the Bronx, offer more treatment for addicts and make Washington Square Park a ''drug-free zone'' by placing it off-limits to those convicted of selling drugs there as a condition of their probation.</p>

        <p>Ruth W. Messinger, who faces Mr. Giuliani in the mayoral race, called for an overhaul of the New York City school system, saying major decisions on running public schools should be shifted to principals. She also said incompetent principals should be fired, failing students should be held back, and that the city's most problem-plagued schools should be closed.</p>

        <p>Horse Trading for a Monet  The ''Monet and the Mediterranean'' show that begins at the Brooklyn Museum of Art on Oct. 10 was built on an ingenious bit of horse trading: Elizabeth W. Easton of the Brooklyn Museum used two modern works to convince the Norton Museum of Art in Florida to loan a Monet that it had been unwilling to part with.</p>
