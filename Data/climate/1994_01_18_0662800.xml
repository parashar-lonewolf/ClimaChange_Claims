        <p>As the Department of Energy's scriptwriters might envision it, the sequel to the movie "Giant" would have West Texans turning into owlish tree- or cactus-huggers, forsaking their drilling rigs for environmentally correct wind turbines.</p>
        <p>The department joined a Texas utility company here on Friday to announce a trial that would produce enough wind-generated electricity by early 1995 to supply 3,000 homes in the middle of the nation's richest oilfields.</p>
        <p>Bill White, the Deputy Secretary of Energy, said the project demonstrated the commitment by President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore to renewable energy sources. Through solar and wind energy, Mr. White said, "we can harness the energy of the sun in an environmentally compatible way."</p>
        <p>Strong, consistent breezes sweep much of this state, especially the arid western region. The department said in a statement, "The wind potential in the state of Texas is sufficient to provide more than five times the state's total amount of electric energy use."</p>
        <p>But utility officials said generating all this power might require reforesting the whole state, including office buildings and possibly backyard barbecues, with wind turbines.</p>
        <p>Mr. White said that the wind power could be generated for 5 cents a kilowatt-hour or less. The Central and South West Corporation, the utility company taking part in the test, says electricity from coal and natural gas in West Texas costs 7.5 to 8.5 cents.</p>
        <p>The Texas trial is part of a $40 million Department of Energy program that includes Maine and Vermont utilities and higher financing for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colo. The $17 million cost of the Texas project is being shared by the company, the department and the Electric Power Research Institute, an industry group.</p>
        <p>Wind farms are already a common sight in Southern California, but not among the cholla cactus, creosote bushes and oil rigs of West Texas.</p>
        <p>Texas faces no imminent power shortages, and oil prices are low. Mr. White, regarded as the oil industry's voice in the department, sees much greater use of wind power in the longer run. "Right there in the middle of the Permian Basin is also one of the the biggest basins for the development of wind energy," he said.</p>
        <p>As a Houston oil and gas lawyer, Mr. White said, "I hope to refine the image of Texas that people will have in 30 years."</p>
