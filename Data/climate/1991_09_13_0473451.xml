        <p>The space shuttle Discovery was launched tonight on a mission to deploy an environmental research satellite for the first detailed study of the effects of man-made pollution on Earth's upper atmosphere.</p>
        <p>One of the main objectives of the 14,500-pound Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite, equipped with 10 remote sensing instruments, will be to measure the life-protecting ozone layer enveloping the planet and to investigate the physical and chemical processes that cause its formation and are leading to its alarming depletion in recent years.</p>
        <p>Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration described the $710 million mission as historic, the first step in an ambitious, long-range program called "Mission to Planet Earth." The agency proposes to spend $30 billion to $40 billion over the next 15 years on spacecraft and other systems for monitoring the planet's health.</p>
        <p>The Discovery, with five astronauts aboard, lifted off at 7:11 P.M., 14 minutes late because of minor communications problems in the final countdown. Early reports indicated that the crew and the spaceship were in excellent condition. Orbit 351 Miles Up</p>
        <p>Deployment of the satellite from the shuttle's cargo bay is scheduled for Saturday night. The satellite is to be left in a 351-mile-high orbit for almost two years of data-collecting operations, directed by the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.</p>
        <p>The satellite is to be traveling a course taking it as far north and south as 57 degrees latitude on each orbit. With the side-looking capability of its scientific instruments, this should give the satellite a view of almost 98 percent of Earth's atmosphere, including most of the polar regions where large holes in the ozone layer have been observed.</p>
        <p>Ozone is a molecule made up of three oxygen atoms that is produced naturally in the upper atmosphere by chemical reactions resulting from solar radiation. The ozone layer at altitudes of nine to 30 miles screens deadly ultraviolet radiation. Its continuing depletion could lead to a rising incidence of skin cancer, damage to food crops and possibly unforeseen consequences for all life on Earth.</p>
        <p>Scientists have identified chlorofluorocarbons released by refrigerators, air-conditioners, some aerosol sprays and industrial processes as the main cause of the vanishing ozone. A single atom of chlorine can destroy 100,000 molecules of ozone. The space agency said today that scientists at the South Pole reported Wednesday that the annual appearance of an ozone hole over Antarctica had begun, a week earlier than in previous years. Beginning to Understand</p>
        <p>Dr. Lennard A. Fisk, NASA's associate administrator for science, said this mission is "where we begin to use our expertise in space to begin to understand what the human species is doing to the planet."</p>
        <p>Previous studies of the ozone problem have been conducted by high-flying balloons, aircraft and the Nimbus 7 weather satellite. But Nimbus is aging, and was limited to measurements of the total ozone content over any particular region of Earth's surface. The American ozone mapping spectrometer installed in a Soviet Meteor 3 spacecraft, launched last month, is similarly limited.</p>
        <p>Dr. Carl A. Reber, chief scientist for the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite, said the satellite would be able to measure variations in ozone at different altitudes in a single column of atmosphere. Several instruments will measure the concentrations and distribution of gases important to ozone depletion, climate change and other atmospheric phenomena.</p>
        <p>"That's what we're after -- vertical profiles of all the molecules between us and outer space," Dr. Reber said.</p>
        <p>Scientists expect the satellite to produce the first complete picture of the upper atmosphere's chemistry, winds and energy at all altitudes and over nearly all parts of the world. They will use these data to improve theoretical models of the upper atmosphere and how its dynamics affect the ozone problem, world climate and other phenomena.</p>
        <p>The launching of the Discovery is the fifth this year and the 43d for the shuttle program. Its timing, in the early evening, was set so that the shuttle would be able to reach the proper altitude and position for releasing the satellite into its designated orbit.</p>
        <p>The astronauts aboard Discovery are Capt. John O. Creighton and Comdr. Kenneth S. Reightler Jr., both of the Navy; Col. James F. Buchli of the Marine Corps; Col. Mark N. Brown of the Air Force, and Maj. Charles D. Gemar of the Army.</p>
        <p>If the mission continues as planned, the astronauts will remain in orbit until early Wednesday morning. They are to land the Discovery on a runway at the Kennedy Space Center at 1:55 A.M. It would be the first nighttime landing for a shuttle here, though there have been several at the Edwards Air Force Base in California.</p>
