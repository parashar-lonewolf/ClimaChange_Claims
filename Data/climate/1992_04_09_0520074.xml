        <p>Now a cherished monument, the Cathedral of Notre Dame has not always been well treated by the citizens of Paris. They have tried to blow it up, they have smashed its statues, they have scrubbed it clean and they have cycled through the aisles.</p>

        <p>Now a cherished monument, the Cathedral of Notre Dame has not always been well treated by the citizens of Paris. They have tried to blow it up, they have smashed its statues, they have scrubbed it clean and they have cycled through the aisles.</p>
        <p>A less violent but perhaps more insidious form of attack, however, has left the 800-year-old Notre Dame with its outer walls damaged, its turrets and buttresses eroded and its famous gargoyles without beaks and ears. And here the culprit is the modern enemy of medieval buildings: polluted air.</p>
        <p>Now, for the first time in 140 years, France's most visited cathedral is about to undergo a major restoration. Its keepers say that many of the outer stones are "fragile and sick" and too many chunks of the decorations have fallen off. They estimate that the work will take 10 years and cost at least $20 million.</p>
        <p>This month a small contingent of stonemasons set to work on the southern tower, which is already wrapped in scaffolding. They will pry loose brittle stones, insert new ones and restore many of the thousands of statues and carvings that have been eaten away by sulfur from car fumes, heating oil and factory smoke.  Nature's Battlefield</p>
        <p>Bernard Fonquernie, the architect in charge of the restoration, points at early Gothic casualties as though surveying a battlefield: splintered balustrades, worn pillars, cracks in flying buttresses. Flagstones have thinned and gutters are leaking.</p>
        <p>He is not worried about the basic structure, which he pronounces solid. The cathedral walls are six to nine feet thick and firmly founded on an earlier cathedral and Roman ramparts. But almost every external part exposed to acid rain, sun, wind and frost has suffered corrosion, he said.</p>
        <p>Most remarkable, in his view, is that additions like statues and a sacristy built in the 1850's are as damaged as the rest of the cathedral. "This shows the monument has suffered most in the past hundred years or so," Mr. Fonquernie said. "It shows that in our harsh civilization, stone has become very ephemeral."</p>
        <p>Notre Dame of Paris may not be the most elegant of France's Gothic cathedrals, and it misses the soaring presence of those, say, at Rheims or Chartres because its main spires were never built. But it has long been at the stormy heart of the nation's history as the site where kings were married, crowned and buried and revolutionaries vented their rage. Every year, 10 million people visit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fonquernie, who has pored over the monument for the last three years, is a great admirer of the 12th- and 13th-century builders. "It looks so balanced, so symmetric," he said. Yet in reality, he continued, "much of the building is crooked."</p>
        <p>"Horizontal and vertical lines were not necessarily respected. The wall faces are not straight. We can see the designers were masters, but the execution was sometimes primitive."</p>
        <p>It is this assembly of the uneven and imprecise, the architect says, that gives aged structures the character and feeling not found in the cold lines of modern buildings. And in the great European debate about how far restoration should be permitted to go, the restorers of the Notre Dame say they have come down on the side of "soft" and "respectful" interventions.  Perfection Not the Aim</p>
        <p>Their most important task, Mr. Fonquernie said, is to protect the monument's authenticity. It means that all stones and carvings will be cut by hand. "This cathedral was made by many pairs of hands and each pair was different," he said. "We cannot put in stones or lines that are too perfectly cut. It would be harsh, create too much contrast."</p>
        <p>In their workshop behind the apse, the stonecutters measure and mold each piece, which will be custom-made for a precise spot in this giant puzzle. Eric Salmon, who is responsible for dressing the stones, was examining slabs of limestone, judging them closely for texture and color, the way another cutter might look at a diamond.</p>
        <p>One big problem, he said, is to find stone that is thick enough and that matches that used by the medieval builders and by Eugene Viollet-le-Duc, who did the 19th-century restoration. "We know what quarries they used," he said. "But Paris is now built over them and we cannot get that stone."</p>
        <p>Finding stonecutters, it appears, is becoming just as difficult because their ancient craft is vanishing. Carvers and dressers of stones, restorers concede, are underrated and underpaid, yet they are professionals who must know the historical techniques and have an artist's eye. They must be willing to live a nomad's life, going from monument to monument. For the Notre Dame, restorers would like more than 30 stonecutters, but so far they have found only 15.</p>
        <p>On the scaffolding, 250 feet above Paris, Mr. Fonquernie and Mr. Salmon raised their voice above the roar of unrelenting traffic on the banks along both sides of the Ile de la Cite. At this height, damage is greater. The men poked at stones so worn they were rounded and flaking. Here, up close, was a wounded gallery of broken gargoyles, monsters without snouts, flowers without their petals.  'Changing the Monument'</p>
        <p>A lot of the work will involve correcting the efforts of the 19th-century restorers, who used cement, even lead, to seal many joints. All of this will have to be removed, Mr. Salmon said. Medieval builders used a porous mixture, permitting water to pass through the stones, he said, but cement is less porous. The water stagnates and ruins the stones.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fonquernie said that to his regret he had to build a barrier on the towers to prevent visitors from committing suicide. "It happens," he said, "and they have killed others down below."</p>
        <p>Probing a fractured monster, the architect returned to the question of authenticity, which he finds troubling. "However careful we are," he said, "ours will be repairs and stones made in 1992. We are changing the monument. Our civilization pushes us to conserve and preserve, to make something lasting that is not made for eternity."</p>
        <p>In his years of restoring monuments around France though, he said, he has learned a few lessons about old buildings. One of them is to look out for falling stones. He said with a laugh, "I never park my car at the foot of a cathedral."</p>

        <p>An article yesterday about the restoration of the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris misstated an aspect of its history. French kings were not crowned or buried there.</p>
