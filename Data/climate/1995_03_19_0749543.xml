        <p>THE threat of Lyme disease is real. It demands that those who work outdoors take practical precautions, without ceasing to enjoy being outdoors.</p>
        <p>Recognition of the illness began 20 years ago when the disease was identified by Allen Steere of the Yale University School of Medicine. Dr. Steere learned about several juvenile rheumatoid arthritis cases in the area of Old Lyme, many of them preceded by a bull's eye rash. Further studies showed that the disease was caused by a bite from a particular black-legged tick. The name of the region where the disease was first identified gave it its name.</p>
        <p>The disease vector is now known to be a minute black-legged tick identified in entomological circles as Ixodes scapularis, or deer tick. During April and May, and into June, nymphs seek hosts to obtain their blood meal. The host has been identified as the white-footed mouse from which the ticks get the spirochete bacterium that causes the disease. These young ticks molt, feed and mature to adults. The adult female gorges on a blood meal, lays up to 2,000 eggs, then dies.</p>
        <p>Although the highest number of adult ticks are found on deer, which seem to tolerate them without harm, the ticks are also found on dogs, cats, raccoons, horses and other mammals as well as on birds. After the eggs hatch, the ticks spend the winter as larvae. These larvae molt to the nymph stage, seek their blood meals, and so on. The life cycle takes two years to complete.</p>
        <p>Researchers say that the nymphal stage of the tick is the most difficult to detect because of its size, that of the period on a newspaper page. The nymphal phase is also the one most often associated with infection.</p>
        <p>Ticks most often can be found right at home. They frequent plantings around a house's foundation as well as flower beds; in wooded areas they are particularly abundant in leaf litter and grasses. Ticks cannot jump but they attach themselves to hosts as they pass by. Ticks are sensitive to body heat and odors, even carbon dioxide. All these factors aid the tick in finding a suitable host for the blood meal. To survive, ticks also need a humid environment.</p>
        <p>Once a tick finds a host, it may crawl around for several days before it begins to feed. For this reason, it is essential to do a thorough tick check when coming in from outdoors. Some gardeners undress right by the washing machine and dump all their clothing into it. Early detection of a tick and its removal is the best preventive measure. If the disease develops, early treatment with antibiotics has proved effective for many patients.</p>
        <p>A tick might be found on any part of the body, especially in regions below the waist. Thorough body checks are especially important for children and for household animals, too. If a tick is sighted, remove it carefully with a fine-pointed tweezers. Lift the tick straight away from the skin and be especially cautious not to break the tick. The object is to remove the tick wholly intact. Coating the tick with petroleum jelly or alcohol is not recommended, nor is using a match as a prod; stick to using tweezers and operate as skillfully as possible.</p>
        <p>Personal precautions before going outdoors are essential. Sometimes it is wise to cover the body with repellents before putting on clothes. Many gardeners use the Avon product called Skin-So-Soft, which can be rubbed on as a body lotion.</p>
        <p>When working outside men and women alike should wear long-sleeved shirts and trousers with pant legs tucked into long socks. And ticks are more easily spotted against clothing that is light in color.</p>
        <p>Many repellents are on the market, and most of them contain the broad-spectrum pesticide known as DEET.</p>
        <p>What percentage of the contents is pesticide is included on the label. Many experts agree that a product with 30 percent is good. But it is also important to note that reactions to DEET have been reported, especially among children. For this reason many of the DEET products are used on clothing only and not applied directly to the skin.</p>
        <p>Another repellent that is effective but must never be applied to the skin is called Permanone. Its active ingredient is permethrin and clothing can be sprayed before it is put on. Label directions recommend using a sweeping motion to moisten the outer surface of clothing with special attention to socks, trouser and shirt cuffs. Protection lasts for at least one day.</p>
        <p>Several studies are currently underway to test possible vaccines for Lyme disease. Hundreds of volunteers, who are considered high risk for the disease, have signed up to be part of this study that is being conducted by several pharmaceutical houses. One test was conducted last year and a second is currently underway. Results may not be known for some time, but an eager populace waits to hear what the results might be.  GARDENING</p>
