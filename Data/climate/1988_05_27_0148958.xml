        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your eloquent editorial ''Promises, Promises on Acid Rain'' (April 30) expresses the asperity of many of your readers with the policies of President Reagan that fail to recognize, let alone cope with, the problem of atmospheric pollutants. These are destroying forests, causing lakes and their fish to die, and now have been shown to kill marine life in Atlantic coastal waters.</p>
        <p>The Associates of the Art Commission, an organization comprising former members of New York City's Art Commission, has adopted and sent urgent resolutions to the President at its last two annual meetings. We pointed out that acid rain, in addition to causing disaster in the natural environment, is having a serious effect on public monuments, statues and historic buildings. One has but to look at the marble statue of George Washington on the western portion of the Washington Arch in Greenwich Village to see a distressing example. The marble facade of the handsome New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue at 42d Street, replete with works of art by famous sculptors, is at risk, actually already noticeably affected.</p>
        <p>We join Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada in demanding that our Federal Government establish controls over polluters and thus begin to reduce the acid rain falling on the beauties of our city, its precious Central and Prospect Parks, its many public works of art and notable architecture. JAMES ROSSANT &amp; MARGOT GAYLE  New York, May 12, 1988  The writers are respectively, president and secretary of the Associates of the Art Commission.</p>
