        <p>Diplomats attending the Earth Summit said today that they had achieved a broad consensus in favor of setting up a high-level watchdog group to insure that governments respect the pledges they make here.</p>
        <p>The new international body, to be called the Sustainable Development Commission, would rely heavily on evidence gathered by private environmental groups.</p>
        <p>It would be modeled on the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva and like it would use peer pressure and public opinion to shame countries into following policies that are compatible with environmental preservation. It would not be empowered to impose fines or other sanctions against offenders.</p>
        <p>The commission would also seek to insure that industrial countries stand by the commitments they give here to supply developing nations with aid and technology to help them meet the costs of conservation measures.</p>
        <p>"There is growing acceptance that the follow-up to the Rio summit should be entrusted to a Sustainable Development Commission," said Britain's Environment Minister, David Maclean, a leader of the push for the new agency. "It will be a forum for peer pressure that will identify gaps and problems."  Wide-Ranging Mandate</p>
        <p>According to a draft document drawn up for adoption by the United Nations General Assembly this fall, the commission will be charged with monitoring government compliance with Agenda 21, the ambitious plan the summit meeting is preparing for cleaning up the world in the coming century. It will also monitor compliance with the new conventions against global warming and on preserving the earth's biological resources.</p>
        <p>The commission is being given a wide-ranging mandate that allows it to check not only the environmental activities of governments but also those of international development agencies like the World Bank, to receive reports from United Nations bodies and to draw on the expertise of private environmental watchdog organizations as well as industry and science.</p>
        <p>"The commission will have a total picture of follow-up and implementation of Agenda 21," Mr. Maclean said.</p>
        <p>The General Assembly is to decide where the commission should be based and how often it should meet.</p>
        <p>The draft document stipulates that the commission will have delegates from 53 nations, like the Human Rights Commission. The document says the delegates should be high-level officials, and Western countries generally want the commission staffed by top Government officials who carry out environmental policies, rather than by regular United Nations diplomats.</p>
        <p>The document says that governments will be encouraged to submit "periodic communications or national reports" to the commission explaining what they are doing to carry out their commitments under Agenda 21. Some Are Reluctant</p>
        <p>But even if they do not provide this information, Western diplomats said, private environmental organizations like the Friends of the Earth and the World Wildlife Fund will be quick to report delinquencies to the commission, just as Amnesty International and other private human rights watchdog groups file complaints with the Human Rights Commission.</p>
        <p>The new commission would have no enforcement powers. But diplomats argue that the experience of the Human Rights Commission shows that governments tend to be highly sensitive to public criticism and can sometimes be made to change their policies as a result.</p>
        <p>Today's consensus was achieved despite the reluctance of some developing nations, led by India and China, to empower a new commission to pry into their environmental policies. Other countries were said to have complained that they lack the resources to provide regular environmental reports.</p>
        <p>And this week some American diplomats here expressed concern that the United States might soon find its environmental policies coming under critical scrutiny by the new commission, following its refusal to accept binding targets for cutting back on greenhouse gas emissions that can heat up the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>The United States received heavy international criticism over that decision and for its refusal to sign the new biodiversity convention to preserve animal and plant life, an agreement which won the European Community's support today.</p>
        <p>But diplomats say the Bush Administration decided against isolating itself further and went along with today's broad agreement to create the new commission.</p>
