        <p>Surprising even themselves, 178 countries ended a marathon bargaining session in Bonn with agreement on the rules of the Kyoto Protocol, the first climate treaty requiring industrial powers to cut emissions of gases linked to global warming. President Bush kept the U.S., the biggest source of such gases, on the sidelines, saying the treaty was unfair and costly. He continued to decline to say when he might propose another approach. The inaction seems to have goaded Congress, where both Democratic and Republican aides say that measures calling for cuts in emissions are likely to pass this year.</p>
