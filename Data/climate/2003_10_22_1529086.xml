        <p>THE next big regulatory battle between California and the auto industry will be over global warming.</p>
        <p>For years, the Golden State has been aggressive on something quite different -- the smog-forming pollutants emanating from tailpipes -- because of the gray haze that settles over its cities. This year, the industry and California's powerful Air Resources Board called a truce on the issue after General Motors and Chrysler dropped a suit against the state's Zero Emission Vehicle mandate. Overall, considerable progress has been made in curbing smog since the 1970's, though this year the state suffered some of its worst pollution problems in more than a half-decade.</p>
        <p>But as one struggle ends for now, another is beginning over a different tailpipe emission, carbon dioxide and other gases, like methane, that many scientists think are contributing to global climate change trends. The issue remains debatable in the scientific community and in Detroit, where global warming is often viewed skeptically.</p>
        <p>The opening salvo came last year, when Gov. Gray Davis of California signed into law the nation's first piece of legislation aimed at curbing automotive emissions of greenhouse gases. The legislation itself is vague and leaves it to the Air Resources Board, a branch of the California Environmental Protection Agency, to work out the details over the next year.</p>
        <p>Automakers are widely expected to sue the state over the measure, but until the specifics of the plan are laid out there is little basis for a court challenge. Battle lines are already coalescing, though, with state regulators and environmentalists on one side and automakers from Detroit to Tokyo, as well as the White House, on the other.</p>
        <p>The Bush administration prefers voluntary action by industries over regulation and withdrew the United States from an international treaty, known as the Kyoto Protocol, to curb greenhouse emissions.</p>
        <p>''When it comes to climate change, California is aligning itself with the rest of the world,'' Alan C. Lloyd, the chairman of the state air board, said in an interview in late September, adding, ''Somewhere along the line, we would expect a lawsuit.''</p>
        <p>''My hope is that somehow we could work with the industry and say: 'Look, it's only a matter of time before these things are addressed. Voluntary agreements will work for a while maybe but you have an opportunity here to help us craft the regulation.' ''</p>
        <p>But he said all the major automakers had indicated resistance to the measure, including Honda, which has not taken part in industry lobbying campaigns against environmental legislation in the past.</p>
        <p>''Many of them are talking to us on a technical basis,'' Dr. Lloyd said, ''but they draw the line there, typically, and say, 'We don't think having a state set tailpipe standards for greenhouse gases is the way to go.' ''</p>
        <p>Since Dr. Lloyd was appointed by Mr. Davis, who has been recalled from office, he could be out of a job when Arnold Schwarzenegger becomes governor. The new administration will mostly draft the regulation. That has aroused concern among environmentalists. Mr. Schwarzenegger has long been a booster of the gas-guzzling Hummer, the S.U.V. that groups like the Sierra Club love to hate. On one campaign stop, he made an offhand remark suggesting that the state should abolish its E.P.A.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwarzenegger's advisers later clarified the remark and said he supported the E.P.A. He has also tried to create a green image; among the positions laid out on his campaign Web site, at www. joinarnold.com, he said he supported the greenhouse gas legislation and would ''work to implement it and to win the expected challenges in court along the way.'' He said he also wanted to make one of his Hummers more environmentally friendly.</p>
        <p>But the new Republican governor also inherits a battle with the Bush administration because of the state's greenhouse gas plan.</p>
        <p>In August, the federal Environmental Protection Agency said it lacked the authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, reversing the stance of the Clinton administration.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, Governor Davis's administration said it would sue the E.P.A. over the issue before he leaves office.</p>
        <p>''It's apparent that California is reading the Clean Air Act one way, and the E.P.A. is reading it another way,'' said Mark Merchant, an E.P.A. spokesman. ''There's a difference of opinion there, and California has decided to ask the court to make a decision.''</p>
        <p>While the suit is partly aimed at prodding federal action on global warming, it is also viewed in California as an effort to counter what could be a potent legal argument against the state's plan to curb auto emissions: if the E.P.A. says it does not have the authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gases, why does California have the authority on air issues granted by the same legislation?</p>
        <p>Many legal experts on both sides believe that winning the suit against the E. P. A. will be crucial for the greenhouse gas law to stand up to a legal challenge and actually take effect, though California regulators do not concede the point.</p>
        <p>''Whatever California does on CO2  emissions would face a double-pronged challenge,'' said Sam Kazman, general counsel for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group that receives industry financing.</p>
        <p>The first prong, he said, would be an argument based on the Clean Air Act authority. The second, he said, would be similar to one that automakers have used against the Zero Emission Vehicle mandate -- that emissions rules are superseded by federal authority to set fuel economy regulations. The argument could be stronger in this case because global warming is tied directly to fuel consumption. While smog-forming pollutants can be filtered by devices like catalytic converters, no such filter exists for carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lloyd believes the state's law will hold up, but added that ''we think very strongly if we lose in the legal arena we're going to win in the court of public opinion,'' thus pressuring automakers to take action nonetheless.</p>
        <p>Certainly, the Air Resources Board is watched closely in automaking capitals from Stuttgart to Tokyo to Detroit -- because California is the world's eighth-largest auto market and because other states are allowed to choose its tougher air regulations over Washington's.</p>
        <p>In an interview last year, Nissan's chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, described the moment his staff told him the company would have to start producing expensive low- and zero-emission vehicles if an earlier and more demanding version of the state's final Zero Emission Mandate took effect.</p>
        <p>''I remember I had a meeting in Tokyo where they showed me all the cost of this stuff,'' Mr. Ghosn said. ''I said, 'Oh my God, the others have to do this too?'  Nobody believes in it, but you have to do it. It's a huge cost, but it's part of the cost of doing business.''</p>
