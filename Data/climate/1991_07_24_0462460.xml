        <p>The most tiresome thing about the heat is that you have to listen to people tell stories about it, all of which have been told before: the story about how you couldn't even get a spot on the beach, the story about how the air-conditioning broke down, the old stories about blowing fans over blocks of ice in luncheonettes.</p>
        <p>But there is always something new under the sun, and this summer it's global warming. People are talking about the weather as an act of man, not of God. Just 10 years ago the ozone layer was largely the purview of the tofu-and-Birkenstock crowd. Now scientists who study this stuff say that as sure as the beaches will fill with bodies on the first 100-degree day, their phones will begin ringing with questions about the slow cooking of planet Earth.</p>

        <p>But there is always something new under the sun, and this summer it's global warming. People are talking about the weather as an act of man, not of God. Just 10 years ago the ozone layer was largely the purview of the tofu-and-Birkenstock crowd. Now scientists who study this stuff say that as sure as the beaches will fill with bodies on the first 100-degree day, their phones will begin ringing with questions about the slow cooking of planet Earth.</p>
        <p>Weather's always been a useful symbol; maybe feeling guilty about the fact that 1990 was the warmest year on record in the Northeast has a lot to do with all the other diminished expectations we're passing along to our children. The old upward curve -- bricklayer to cop to lawyer to judge in four generations -- seems to be heading down for our kids as steeply as the trajectory of a roller coaster.</p>
        <p>Downward mobility is the hip term for what we see in their futures. No house, no savings -- and now no autumn. We can picture them huddled around the air-conditioner 50 years from now saying, "Oh, Mom, not that old story about how you had seasons when you were young!" But that old story already feels true. Winters without snow. Springs that last 24 hours. Long hot summers. In short, southern California for all.</p>
        <p>It makes me think of times driving with my father, when he would wave an arm out the car window and say, "I remember when all this was farmland." You'd look out at 28 splanches and a strip mall and think, there he goes again.</p>
        <p>It makes me think of fishing with my father in Delaware Bay when I was 5, of how we sat for hours pulling flounder after flounder into the boat, their pale undersides seeing the sun for the first time. Now the flounder are fewer and farther between in many of those fishing spots.</p>
        <p>The Alaskan snow melted two weeks earlier in the 1980's than in the 1940's. Put an icicle in the freezer this January to give your children something to remember you by.</p>
        <p>This generation of kids takes for granted heart transplants, air travel, recycling, take-out food, air-conditioned cars and personal computers.  Every time I look at one of their upper arms, I can't help noticing that they have no small round scar from smallpox inoculation, the tattoo of those of us born before the 1970's. In an effort not to seem like hopeless nostalgics, we try not to dwell too much on a time when the air wasn't earth-toned.</p>
        <p>Here's the good news: The sunsets and sunrises are expected to be spectacular this fall. Now the bad: That's because of stratospheric aerosols produced by the volcano eruption in the Philippines.</p>
        <p>We still buy the things manufactured with chemicals that foul the air, still talk nervously of global warming and then jump in the car to go to the beach, leaving our own little remembrance of carbon dioxide passed. It gives new meaning to the old line about everybody talking about the weather but nobody doing anything about it.</p>
        <p>Perhaps this is the beginning of some change, the fact that so many people seem worried that mild winters and long summers are environmental, not accidental. Once we believed that only God could make a heat wave; now we think that maybe we took creation into our own hands and fashioned a monster, a tent of gases that trap the warm air as surely as glass plates do.</p>
        <p>The folks who argue about whether we're really getting warmer say the 1990's will tell. They may also tell whether we're planning to do anything about this. Otherwise someday our children will settle down with the grandkids to tell them yet again the old story about the Flexible Flyer, about days so cold that the rain would actually freeze and coat the ground with a frozen white blanket on which you could skim downhill. One of them will surely say: "Ah, she's told us that one a million times. I still think she made it up."</p>
