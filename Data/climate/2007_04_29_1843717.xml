        <p>BELIEVE it or not, Fort Lee was once Hollywood. Around the turn of the 20th century, the pioneer filmmaker D. W. Griffith shot his one-reelers there. In the early 1900s, the silent sirens Mary Pickford, Pearl White and Theda Bara emanated their glamour in scores of films made in studios at what is now the western end of the George Washington Bridge.</p>
        <p>Soon, however, Hollywood became Hollywood; and that was ''the end'' for Fort Lee's movie career.</p>
        <p>Modern-day Fort Lee, chockablock with small shops, convenience stores and high-rise apartment buildings, is fairly devoid of glamour by any critical lights -- and more than ready for a comeback.</p>
        <p>This July, that moment will come, according to the developers of a $1 billion complex that is to have more than 800 condominiums, a first-class hotel and conference center and extensive new retail and office space.</p>
        <p>On a 16-acre tract that once housed some of the early film studios and later became a parcel in the Helmsley real estate portfolio, the complex, called the Centuria, is to rise.</p>
        <p>It has been a rather long time coming. Several borough officials have complained publicly in recent weeks about the apparent lack of progress at the site since Harry B. Helmsley's estate sold it for $50 million two years ago to Town &amp; Country Developers, an affiliate of Whiteweld Barrister &amp; Brown, a Manhattan real estate investment concern.</p>
        <p>''Getting the site ready to build took a lot longer than we thought it would,'' said John L. Johnson, who heads the Centuria Corporation, a division of Town &amp; Country established to develop in Fort Lee.</p>
        <p>But progress is now poised to happen. Some 50,000 tons of contaminated soil have been removed from the site, which is bordered by Lemoine Avenue, Main Street, Central Road and Bridge Plaza South. Final state environmental approvals are pending, and a sales office for the condos is set to open early next month, Mr. Johnson said.</p>
        <p>The developer has released detailed renderings and building floor plans and predicts a groundbreaking in July for the hotel-condominium structure, which it hopes to open sometime next year.</p>
        <p>''We are going to create a hotel that will outshine every other hotel in New Jersey,'' the developer asserted, ''with larger rooms that have incredible close-up views of the bridge, the river, Manhattan -- and a lobby with a very high 'wow' factor.''</p>
        <p>He said negotiations with Westin Hotels, a division of Starwood, were proceeding. (There is already one hotel in Fort Lee, a Hilton on Route 4.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson predicted that the Centuria's condos -- especially the 60 that will be on the 5 top floors of the 14-story hotel -- would be popular places for sports and movie stars to live. ''Yankee Stadium is only 15 to 20 minutes away,'' he noted. ''And there is still a lot of filmmaking going on in New York.''</p>
        <p>In a nod to the past, the Centuria Corporation has committed to building a film museum in downtown Fort Lee and a four- to six-screen fine-art movie theater within walking distance of the Centuria.</p>
        <p>The development company also agreed to put up new police and fire substations and pay for their equipment. In addition, Centuria will provide the borough with $2.9 million for creating affordable housing, and pay out approximately $6 million for road improvements, sewer systems and designated public parking in Centuria's garages.</p>
        <p>The project will be the biggest in Fort Lee history, according to the developers and officials of the borough. While other Jersey ''Gold Coast'' towns along the Hudson River have been substantially remade in the last 20 years, nothing on the scale of the Centuria has been attempted within the densely developed confines of Fort Lee, which has no other large parcels that could easily be cleared for redevelopment.</p>
        <p>''This is the future of development around the country,'' Mr. Johnson said, ''and we may have gotten one of the last available sites in this area: close in to a downtown, and big enough to create a city within a city, with everything right at hand. You can live, work, eat, shop, be entertained, all without owning a car.''</p>
        <p>In this era of heightened concern about global warming, the project can claim to be ''green'' because of its location, Mr. Johnson suggested. ''If you currently drive into Manhattan, you can cut an hour off the commute,'' he said. ''Bus service will be a block away. We will also run a shuttle from Centuria to the ferry in Edgewater. And the hotel may offer a direct shuttle to the city. We're talking about that.''</p>
        <p>Explaining that the mixed-use project would be a first of its kind for his company, which has previously concentrated on residential development, he said the plan was to initiate other such projects elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Centuria will offer more than 800 residential units, mostly one- and two-bedroom condos, with 126,000 square feet of retail space at ground level, Mr. Johnson said. The complex, which is centered on the 240-room hotel, will also include a 90,000-square-foot office structure and a 65,000-square-foot convention center.</p>
        <p>On the five-building development's east side, a 14-story building will hold 240 apartments, he said. An adjacent midrise building will provide 377 more residential units and the community clubhouse.</p>
        <p>The office space, conference center and most of the retail space will be on the western side, with 151 condos above the shops. The 60 condos above the hotel will be three-bedroom units, said Mr. Johnson.</p>
        <p>The company said the prices of the residential units had not yet been set.</p>
