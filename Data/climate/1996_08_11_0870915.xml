        <p>Evidence of life on Mars, real or imaginary, has been turning up for more than a century, and the latest hypothesis put forward by NASA scientists extends a tradition marked chiefly by disappointment.</p>
        <p>NASA's announcement last week of the finding of evidence of ancient microbial life on a meteor believed to be from Mars was the latest in a long series of Martian discoveries. Compared with images earlier scientists painted of advanced canal-building civilizations, it seemed a trifle mundane.</p>
        <p>However, unlike the earlier claims, it may be true.</p>
        <p>The more radical idea that Mars might harbor an advanced civilization gained many enthusiastic believers after observations were reported by the Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli in 1877.</p>
        <p>Using a small telescope, Schiaparelli thought he could see a network of thin ''canali,'' or grooves, on the face of Mars. The Italian word was mistranslated into English as ''canals,'' and from this it was inferred that a civilization must have existed to build the canals.</p>
        <p>The idea was endorsed and promoted by the American astronomer Percival Lowell, who made some telescopic observations of his own and drew sketches of what he saw.</p>
        <p>In the words of Dr. Carl Sagan of Cornell University, ''Lowell was unfortunately one of the worst draftsmen who ever sat down at a telescope, and the kind of Mars that he drew was composed of little polygonal blocks connected by a multitude of straight lines,'' the kind of lines Schiaparelli thought he had seen.</p>
        <p>A rich vein of science fiction was created by the Schiaparelli-Lowell ''discovery,'' a genre that thrives today. But it was not long before scientists began a corrosive scrutiny of the canal claim.</p>
        <p>In 1894, Edward Emerson Barnard, an American astronomer, tried to repeat the Martian canal observation and reported: ''To save my soul, I can't believe in the canals as Schiaparelli (or Lowell) draws them. I see details where he has drawn none.'' The ''canals,'' Barnard wrote, ''are a fallacy.''</p>
        <p>Subsequent observations by skilled astronomers using ever-larger telescopes -- and later, visits by the Mariner and Viking spacecraft -- failed to find any suggestion of canals on the Martian surface. But they did find huge river canyons, proof that bone-dry Mars once had liquid water.</p>
        <p>In 1971, Dr. Sagan proposed a reason for the canal illusion.</p>
        <p>''The canals of Mars are probably due to the eye's penchant for order,'' he said in a 1971 conference on extra-terrestrial life. ''It is much simpler to draw disconnected fine detail as a few lines, joining them up, than to put down all the irregular mottlings observed in an instant of good seeing.''</p>
        <p>Despite the demise of the theory about the canals, popular belief in Martian life remained strong.</p>
        <p>A seemingly hardy line of evidence of color changes on the Martian surface emerged from observations by astronomers. Patches of dark color scattered across the light Martian deserts seem to change in extent and darkness, almost as if seasonal changes in climate were responsible. Since the 1870's when French astronomers proposed the idea, it has sometimes been suggested that the dark patches represent vegetation.</p>
        <p>Mars, like Earth, has polar icecaps, and the size of these features seems to change seasonally. As the caps shrink, dark patches expand in the planet's middle latitudes: a phenomenon described by the French-born American astronomer Gerard de Vaucouleurs in 1948 as ''a wave of darkening.''</p>
        <p>To some, this hinted not only of vegetation but also of distinct growing seasons on Mars. In ''The Planets,'' a popular book published in 1962, the astronomer Patrick Moore wrote: ''Vegetation might be expected to behave in this manner; it would surely develop as soon as moisture reached it from the shrinking polar caps. For this reason, it has been widely supposed that the dark patches are in fact due to living matter.''</p>
        <p>Alas, a decade later, spacecraft visited Mars and found no living matter. Cameras and other instruments disclosed that the color changes came from sandstorms and other atmospheric effects, not vegetation.</p>
        <p>The exploration of the solar system has brought other disappointments to the search for extraterrestrial life. Venus was once regarded as a possible habitat because it is about the same size and density as Earth. Because Venus is eternally covered by opaque clouds, people were free to devise all kinds of theories about its surface and the living beings it might support.</p>
        <p>But when Soviet and American spacecraft reached Venus in 1967 and made measurements, the results were disheartening. The Venus surface is hot enough to melt many metals, and its atmosphere consists largely of sulfuric acid. Hopes of finding life on Venus vanished.</p>
        <p>The Viking Mars landers dealt a double setback to Martian life. Not only did they find no vegetation. They also failed to find anything capable of metabolizing the specially tagged carbon dioxide that their robotic laboratories supplied to samples of Martian soil. Most scientists therefore say they believe that the Viking search for life yielded negative results, although a few have said the results were ambivalent and that life was not entirely ruled out.</p>
        <p>But believers in Martian life had one heartening gift from a Viking lander. The craft sent back a picture showing an arrangement of rocks that has been interpreted by tabloid weeklies and others interested in extraterrestrial life as the image of a humanoid face.</p>
        <p>Geologists and other scientists have pronounced this image to be a mere accidental jumble. But at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration news conference on Wednesday, the agency's administrator, Dr. Daniel S. Goldin, was asked whether future missions would investigate the Martian ''face.'' Dr. Goldin replied that other goals had higher priority, but that a robotic explorer might take a look at the face if schedules permitted.</p>
        <p>There are high hopes that the minute spheres and worm-like carbonate structures found in the ''Mars meteorite'' will turn out to be genuine microfossils of once-living organisms. Yet the testimony of the tiny rock features may prove to be as illusory as the Martian canals.</p>
