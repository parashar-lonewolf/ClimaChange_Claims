        <p>Ariane Anthony is probably the only New York choreographer and performance artist who could get away with portraying, on the same evening, an at least superficially earnest lecturer on global warming and a glamorous gardener who eventually falls in love with the snails she intends to exterminate. Ms. Anthony did both, and more, in ''Snail and other spirited dances and films'' on Sunday night at the Construction Company on East 18th Street in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>In ''Global Crisis'' Ms. Anthony was Shirley Sturm, a dowdy young environmental activist and ''sex-positive feminist'' with the soul of a burlesque queen. Some of Shirley's lecture was more sad than funny. Some was hilarious, as when she lip-synced an over-the-top pop song about loving the world.</p>

        <p>Ariane Anthony is probably the only New York choreographer and performance artist who could get away with portraying, on the same evening, an at least superficially earnest lecturer on global warming and a glamorous gardener who eventually falls in love with the snails she intends to exterminate. Ms. Anthony did both, and more, in ''Snail and other spirited dances and films'' on Sunday night at the Construction Company on East 18th Street in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>In ''Global Crisis'' Ms. Anthony was Shirley Sturm, a dowdy young environmental activist and ''sex-positive feminist'' with the soul of a burlesque queen. Some of Shirley's lecture was more sad than funny. Some was hilarious, as when she lip-synced an over-the-top pop song about loving the world.</p>
        <p>And there were a few chilling moments, as when Shirley left the stage singing what she described as a paraphrase of a love song she had written. ''Ocean blue, ocean blue, you're a long way from Kalamazoo,'' she sang, then paused and peered earnestly at her audience. ''It's true,'' she said. ''At least for now.''</p>
        <p>In ''Snail'' Ms. Anthony slowly moved around the stage in a fantastical piece of looping, wearable sculpture of yarn, rope, twine and wire, created by Agata Oleksiak. Ms. Anthony talked of gardening and snails as she moved, eventually becoming both woman and snail, to an atmosphere-setting score by John Stone, her longtime collaborator. She wrote the witty, wistful text, as well as the script for ''Global Crisis.''</p>
        <p>The program's other highlight was ''Airmail Dance,'' created by Ms. Anthony and Bryan Hayes from dance-plotting drawings by Remy Charlip, which he mails to performers interested in the piece. Set to a tangy, dusky original score by Carolyn Lord and performed stylishly by Monica Olsson and Vincent McCloskey, the duet resembled a series of flowing calligraphic shapes that were also provocative choreography.</p>
