        <p>The crisis in California's grid seems to have abated for now, but in its wake, it has left renewed interest in alternative energy technologies. By 2006, the state hopes that 17 percent of its power will come from renewable energy, and it is now allocating $135 million a year to meet that goal. But California has its work cut out: last year, only 12 percent of its energy came from alternative sources. Here's what is in the pipeline.</p>
        <p>FOOD IS FUEL  Recently, Los Angeles World Airports, which manages LAX, began hauling small amounts of food waste from an airline catering company to a treatment plant nearby. After the food is ground (pictured above) and ''digested'' in a tank, the methane that results powers a steam turbine that generates electricity. The airport eventually hopes to recycle all 8,000 tons of leftover food produced each year by airline caterers. The plant already operates with electricity derived from sewage it processes, a fuel that costs about 2 cents per kilowatt-hour; Jerry Hernandez, a sanitary engineer for the city of Los Angeles, says that food may even be a cheaper fuel. Can mystery meat and sewage compete with natural gas and coal? Depends on how you look at it. Electricity from natural gas and coal might come cheaper, but some economists say that renewable energies deserve a handicap that takes into account their environmental benefits, like clearing the atmosphere of potent greenhouse gases like methane.</p>

        <p>TREASURE FROM TRASH  Landfill gas is too weak to power most generators, but new microturbines, made by a company named Capstone, can burn gas that has a third of the fuel of natural gas. In August, the L.A. Department of Water and Power installed 50 microturbines at the Lopez Canyon landfill. (They now power 1,500 homes.) Next, Edan Prabhu, founder of a company called FlexEnergy, plans to develop seven prototype turbines, which could run on even weaker gas: ''If it comes out of a bakery or a printing plant, I'd be able to suck that into our machine.''</p>
