        <p>TWO Congressmen introduced a bill on Friday that would encourage the sharing of medical knowledge by prohibiting patents for surgical procedures.</p>
        <p>Representative Greg Ganske, Republican of Iowa and a surgeon, and Representative Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, said physicians increasingly appear to be seeking patents on new procedures that were previously considered the evolutionary product of the entire medical profession.</p>
        <p>"One should not have to pay a royalty to use an advance in a surgical technique," Representative Ganske said. "Patents will prevent those advances from becoming widespread."</p>
        <p>Dr. Samuel Pallin, an eye surgeon in Sun City, Ariz., has made some of his colleagues furious, for example, by contending that his patent entitles him to a royalty each time a certain type of incision is made.</p>
        <p>Representative Ganske said nearly a score of medical associations, including the American Medical Association, support the bill. The measure does not appear to be so universally favored by patent experts.</p>
        <p>"The whole point of the monopoly of a patent," said Roger E. Schechter, a law professor at George Washington University, "is to act as an encouragement for innovation."  A New Test For Ulcer Bacterium</p>
        <p>Drugs and medical devices, however, have long been protected by patent law. One medical instrument patented last week would allow doctors to use a breath test to detect H. pylori, the bacterium that has recently been implicated in about 80 percent of stomach ulcers and nearly all intestinal ulcers.</p>
        <p>Currently, doctors must fish an endoscope down the throat of a patient and snip a sample of stomach tissue to test for the bacterium. But Daniel E. Murnick, a professor of physics at Rutgers University, said he had developed a laser system that can noninvasively detect the presence of H. pylori with as much precision as an endoscopic test.</p>
        <p>Dr. Murnick's instrument is essentially a new method of mass spectroscopy, a technique for measuring the presence of different isotopes that has been around more than 50 years. He said his system was faster, smaller and probably less expensive.</p>
        <p>Isotopes are different forms of the same element -- carbon, for example -- which differ only in the number of neutrons in each atom.</p>
        <p>H. pylori, it turns out, voraciously breaks down urea, a body byproduct normally secreted in urine. In the process, carbon dioxide is released into the bloodstream and then expelled through the breath. When patients ingest small amounts of urea that have been labeled with specific carbon isotopes, the carbon dioxide they exhale soon after will contain slightly higher than normal concentrations of that isotope.</p>
        <p>Researchers have for several years been testing in laboratory studies for H. pylori using carbon-14, a radioactive isotope. "The problem," Dr. Murnick said, "is most people don't like to swallow radioactive things."</p>
        <p>Dr. Murnick's instrument, by contrast, detects the presence of carbon-12 and carbon-13, which are nonradioactive isotopes. The device employs lasers whose light changes the electrical properties only of these two carbon isotopes, leaving all others undisturbed. By measuring these electrical changes, subtle difference can be detected in the natural ratio of carbon-12 and carbon-13 after the labeled urea has been ingested. If a change is found, H. pylori is present.</p>
        <p>Alimenterics Inc., a Newark-based company that is developing the laser system for H. pylori detection, said it expected to begin clinical trials this year. Dr. Murnick received patent 5,394,236, which was assigned to Rutgers. A Seaworthy Urn For the Last Voyage</p>
        <p>Some people would prefer to be cremated upon death and stipulate that their ashes be scattered at sea. Two Florida inventors have come up with a new way to meet that request.</p>
        <p>David R. Humble and Hans Barth have developed a small vessel made of biodegradable plastic. They say it is designed to resemble the velella jellyfish, which has a thin triangular flap that acts as a sail.</p>
        <p>Mr. Humble contends that from the right spot, the floating urn can sail across an ocean. "You couldn't launch it off Fort Lauderdale because of the trade winds," Mr. Humble cautioned. "It would end up back on the beach."</p>
        <p>Mr. Humble and Mr. Barth were granted patent 5,393,253, which has been assigned to Product Lab of Deerfield Beach, Fla.</p>
