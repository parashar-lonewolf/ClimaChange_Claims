        <p>For Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, who only a year ago seemed to be emerging as Europe's most powerful leader, the summit meeting here this week was a rude lesson in how quickly the world balance can change.</p>
        <p>At the 1990 summit talks in Houston, Mr. Kohl was welcomed as the leader of a mighty nation on the brink of unification and superpower status. This year, he found himself much weakened and unable to win support for his most cherished proposals, chief among them a plan for vast Western aid for the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kohl's loss of power and status reflects his own deepening problems at home, but also the renewed strength of the United States. The London summit meeting made clear that, largely as a result of its success in the Persian Gulf war, the United States has recaptured the dominant world role that some thought it had lost.</p>
        <p>In the 19 months since the Berlin wall fell, Mr. Kohl has become President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's strongest political ally. In that period, according to figures released by the German delegation here, Germany has provided 40 percent of the foreign aid sent to the Soviet Union and the nations of Eastern Europe. Japan and the United States were said to have provided less than 7 percent each.  Kohl's Diminishing Position</p>
        <p>"The balance is just not right," Economics Minister Jurgen Mollemann said this week.</p>
        <p>But there was no suggestion at the London summit talks that either Japanese or American officials share the German view. Chancellor Kohl realized several months ago that he was no longer in a position to press other leaders into approving a vast aid program for the Soviets. At the summit meeting, he confined himself to seeking more limited help.</p>
        <p>But even those efforts proved less than successful. The world leaders who met here agreed to give the Soviets an undefined "special status" in the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, but refused to commit themselves to giving the Soviets full membership at some future point, as Mr. Kohl had urged. Nor would the other leaders accept Mr. Kohl's proposal that the Soviets be offered new credits from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.</p>
        <p>The other area in which Mr. Kohl had hoped for greater support was protection of the global environment. He failed to win clear financial support for a German-backed pilot program intended to protect rain forests in Brazil. His plea for new actions to protect the earth's ozone layer also fell on deaf ears.  Slumping German Economy</p>
        <p>Commentaries in the German press today portrayed the London summit conference as a difficult moment for Mr. Kohl. The economic newspaper Handelsblatt called the summit meeting "anything but a success" for him, and asserted that his appeals on behalf of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe had been greeted with "icy silence."</p>
        <p>Next year's economic summit meeting will be held in Germany, and Mr. Kohl hopes to be in a position to press his views more forcefully there. But the aura of glory and success that surrounded him during the heady days of German unification appears to have faded.</p>
        <p>Germany's economy, though still the strongest in Europe, is slumping under the burden of vast expenditures needed to rebuild the eastern part of the country. Mr. Kohl's personal popularity has been falling steadily, and his Christian Democratic Union has lost a series of local elections.  Fear of Total Soviet Collapse</p>
        <p>Over the last year, Mr. Kohl's Government has expended great amounts of money and effort trying to raise the former East Germany up from ruin. Aides say the Chancellor thinks that experience has given him a special understanding of how difficult it is to rebuild nations that lived for decades under Communism. That belief, as well as his unusually close political friendship with Mr. Gorbachev, has made Mr. Kohl the strongest and most vocal advocate of Western help for the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries.</p>
        <p>German leaders have been candid about their reasons for supporting Soviet appeals for Western help.</p>
        <p>First and foremost, Germans recognize that without Mr. Gorbachev's assent, their nation could not have been unified last year. Second, they are acutely aware that 300,000 Soviet troops remain on German soil, and are eager for them to be withdrawn by 1994 as Mr. Gorbachev has promised. Third, they feel a lingering sense of guilt over Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union 50 years ago.</p>
        <p>Finally, the Germans fear what would happen to their own country if the Soviet Union collapsed. At the very least, hundreds of thousands of Soviet refugees would pour across their borders. It is cheaper, they reason, to aid Soviet citizens in the Soviet Union than to wait until they flood into Germany.</p>
        <p>At the London summit meeting, it appeared that the French and Italian leaders shared some of Mr. Kohl's sense of urgency. But they were easily outweighed by other leaders, especially President Bush, who say the Soviets have not made enough political and economic reforms to justify a major infusion of aid.</p>
