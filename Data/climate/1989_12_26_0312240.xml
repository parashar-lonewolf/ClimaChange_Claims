        <p>LEAD: MOUNT Erebus, the only active volcano in Antarctica, is spewing microscopic crystals of pure gold over the white continent.</p>
        <p>MOUNT Erebus, the only active volcano in Antarctica, is spewing microscopic crystals of pure gold over the white continent.</p>
        <p>The gold particles are far too fine and widely dispersed to harvest as bullion. But scientists studying the interaction of volcanoes with the atmosphere use the gold as a valuable signature of Mount Erebus, distinguishing the ash of this volcano from that of all others.</p>
        <p>The gases and suspended particles that volcanoes hurl into the atmosphere have come under increasing scrutiny because of their possible role in damaging the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>Ozone in the upper atmosphere blocks the sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet radiation, but in the last tow years huge gaps have opened in the ozone shield. The worst of these holes opened over Antarctica in 1987 and again this year. In temperate zones, the concentration of ozone in the upper atmosphere has been reduced by small amounts.</p>
        <p>Scientists believe that chlorofluorocarbons (Freon gases) released form spray cans, air conditioners, foam plastic and other human sources have caused much of the chemical degradation of the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>But volcanoes also emit large amounts of chlorine compounds, probably including hydrochloric acid, that are thought to cause ozone depletion. To estimate the relative impact of volcanic gases and suspended particles on the atmosphere, scientists are studying Erebus, among other mountains. They are examining emissions of carbon dioxide, which can contribute to the warming of the atmosphere, and sulfur dioxide, sulfuric acid and nitrogen compounds, which contribute to acid rain. Hurling Boulders of Basalt</p>
        <p>From a distance, the snow-sheathed flanks of Erebus and the plume of white smoke streaming from its summit form one of the most beautifil landmarks on Ross Island. But within the Erebus crater is a red-hot lava lake pouringf choking acidic gases into the air and occasionally hurling boulders of porous basalt toward populated camps on the mountain. The air is suffocatingly thin at an altitude of 12,450 feet. The summit temperature even in summer is about minus 30 degress Fahrenheit, and winds reach gale force.</p>
        <p>The discovery of gold in Erebus eruptions was made by Dr. Raymond L. Chuan of the University of New Hampshire at Durham and one of his students.</p>
        <p>''We have found that gold particles as well as particles of chromium oxide and particles of a certain carbonate occur in the ash of ERebus, and from none of the other volcanoes throughout the world that I have studies,'' Dr. Chuan said, ''This means we can reliably track the eruptions of Erebus in the atmosphere and on the earth's surface even where material form other volcanoes might be mixed in.''</p>
        <p>Cylindrical core samples of ice andsnow extracted from the depths of the East Antarctica and Greenland ice caps at opposite poles of theworld are stratified, and layers of ice, in common with layers of sedimentary rock, can be identified with specific geological ages. South polar ice contains a stratified record of duct deposited by volcanic eruptions going back 200,000 years.</p>
        <p>These strata also contain clues about the temperature of the air over the ages, and other atmospheric conditions affecting life that might have been modified by volcanoes. The methods Dr. Chuan and others here are developing amy make it possible to predict what kind of effect a given volcano might have on the atmosphere and therefore on life.</p>
        <p>Part of this study entails ascent of the mountain by helicopter and snowmobile to the fuming crater, an arduous and sometimes dangerous trip. Scientific teams must work close to the lava to draw samples of gas and minerals. To get to the summit of Erebus, researchers customarily stop for several days at lower camps on the mountain to accustom themselves to the lack of oxygen.</p>
        <p>''I feel pretty weak during the half day I spend at the summit.'' Dr. Chuan said. ''Luckily, there are some strong graduate students who act as sherpas and carry our instruments.''</p>
        <p>But even when no scientists are at the top, a solar-powered television camera perched on the crater rim sends continuous pictures of the steaming eruptions of Erebus to a snug building at New Zealand's Scott base, which is two miles from McMurdo and near the base of the volcano.</p>
        <p>Dr. Chuan has invented a new instrument for sampling suspended particles in the plumes of volcanoes. The instrument is mounted in an airplane that flies through the plume. Air is drawn in and passed over a succession of thin nickel plates, which collect depostis of successive sizes of volcanic aprticles. The instrument automatically weighs the particles and preserves them for later analysis.</p>
        <p>On the ground, a scanning electron microscope reveals the shapes of the particles and also discloses their chemical compositions.</p>
        <p>''The techniques we have developed in studying ERebus are helping us track the effects of volcanoes throughout the world.'' Dr. Chuan said. ''In trying to forecast the fate of our global habitat, some of these issues may be very important.''</p>
