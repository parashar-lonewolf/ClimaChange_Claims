        <p>Meeting in the relaxed setting of Camp David, President Bush and Japan's new prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, jointly embraced a rapid reform of Japan's recession-plagued economy but carefully sidestepped major differences on global warming and missile defense.</p>
        <p>The meeting today was stage-managed to emphasize the United States-Japan partnership and to subject the two leaders to relatively few questions about the implications of Japan's economic strategy or their differences on the Kyoto Protocol, the global warming accord that Mr. Bush has rejected as ''dead.''</p>
        <p>They agreed today that the two governments would explore restarting negotiations on the accord. But in a joint statement Mr. Koizumi emphasized the importance of the 1997 agreement, and Mr. Bush simply acknowledged that global warming was a problem both nations needed to address.</p>
        <p>The meeting took place as Japan sinks deeper into recession, after a decade of slow growth and a deepening banking crisis. Mr. Bush, aware that his guest faces a crucial parliamentary election next month, heartily endorsed Mr. Koizumi's reform plans.</p>
        <p>''I have no reservations about the economic reform package the prime minister is advancing,'' he said as the two men talked to a small group of reporters on the grounds of the presidential retreat in Maryland. ''He talks about tackling some difficult issues that some leaders in the past refused to address.''</p>
        <p>A senior aide to Mr. Bush said the meeting, in a small cabin at Camp David, ''was energetic, with really good chemistry.''</p>
        <p>The two men spent a considerable amount of time in the ''Maple'' cabin talking about the bad debts that are weighing down the Japanese economy, and which are increasing in size as the recession worsens. But Mr. Bush did not press for details about whether or how Mr. Koizumi's government would finally close failing banks, or pump more money into the banking system -- something Japan can ill afford to do now.</p>
        <p>Speaking to reporters with Mr. Koizumi, Mr. Bush talked about the experience of banks in Texas in the 1980's, when, he said, ''we acted to remedy a situation in which we had bad loans, nonperforming assets, and there was some pain.'' He said the Texas economy had come back ''stronger than before,'' although economists note a huge difference in scale between the savings and loan problem in Mr. Bush's home state and the troubles of banks in the world's second-largest economy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush did not mention the concerns that some of his economic aides and many Japanese officials have about the short-term costs of Mr. Koizumi's reforms. Japanese officials warn that fixing the banking system, which is sinking under $1 trillion in bad debts, and deregulating the economy could set off unemployment and further deflation. That, in turn, could worsen slowdowns in the United States and Europe.</p>
        <p>Much as Mr. Bush said two weeks ago that he had searched the eyes of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and found a man he could trust, Mr. Koizumi said he was pleasantly surprised by his first meeting with Mr. Bush. ''I didn't feel at the outset I would be able to establish such a strong relationship of trust with the president,'' he volunteered.</p>
        <p>In public at least, the two men kept the conversation and the atmosphere light. Mr. Bush and Mr. Koizumi tossed a baseball in front of reporters.</p>
        <p>But the easy tone could not conceal the magnitude of the problem that Japan and its trading partners face.</p>
        <p>''On the economic side, everyone is reduced to praying, and hoping that some of the economic reforms can be put in place,'' said Kenneth Courtis, vice chairman for Asia at Goldman, Sachs in Tokyo. ''But the fact is that unwinding the banking crisis will be very difficult, at a time that we remember that unwinding a much smaller crisis in Thailand in 1997 had vast global implications.''</p>
        <p>At a news conference in Washington this evening, Mr. Koizumi insisted that ''a Japan-initiated global recession will not occur,'' and he said that reviving the Japanese economy was ''the greatest mission'' for his governemnt.</p>
        <p>But he was not specific in response to questions about how he planned to accomplish that goal. He also said that pressure for reform from the United States did not bother him. ''I will accept it all as advice,'' he said, ''even though at times we may feel displeased.</p>
        <p>Just as Mr. Bush praised Mr. Koizumi's reform plans, the prime minister was careful not to publicly cross the president on the global warming pact. ''I am not disappointed in the president's position,'' Mr. Koizumi said, although a week ago he said Mr. Bush's stance was deplorable. Today he said that if Washington and Tokyo could cooperate, ''we will be able to create means which will be more effective in dealing with the global warming issue,'' and he said he would not proceed without the United States.</p>
        <p>Japan is caught between its desire to win passage of the treaty -- which requires industrial nations to reduce to pre-1990 levels emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that cause global warming -- and the strong opposition of its largest trading partner and military ally.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Koizumi arrived, an American Air Force sergeant was questioned in the rape of a Japanese woman on the island of Okinawa, where tens of thousands of American military personnel are based. The incident was not discussed, the senior aide said, and Mr. Koizumi ''said he understood how important the American presence was for Japanese and Asian security.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush and Mr. Koizumi also announced a bilateral economic initiative, aimed at promoting growth and discussing economic and regulatory reform, foreign direct investment, and market openings.</p>
