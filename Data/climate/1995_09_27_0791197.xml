        <p>There isn't much to do in the evening in the Douro Valley, so after dinner here at the Quinta do Noval, guests wander into the vat house to watch vineyard workers stomp the grapes.</p>
        <p>The guests, friends of the owners and sales representatives from around the world, stare at the workers who are treading slowly, knee-deep in grapes and juice. The workers, most of them from villages even more remote than this mountain fastness in north-central Portugal, stare back at the guests, creatures from another world.</p>
        <p>"It's a bit embarrassing," a Paris businessman said. "My wife and I stand around with drinks in our hands, while these people are working like dogs."</p>
        <p>It is a unique confrontation between the modern and the medieval. For their part, the workers earn extra pay for the nightly sessions in the open stone vats called lagars.</p>
        <p>The Quinta do Noval, one of Portugal's most famous producers of Port, dates back to 1715, and the grapes, a half-dozen or so different varieties, have been crushed in much the same fashion at every harvest since then. "Every modern method has been tried," said Christian Seely, Noval's managing director, "but no one has found a better way to make Port."</p>
        <p>Traditionally, the treading is done at night, because the men and boys who do most of it labor in the vineyards during the day. Women, children and the elderly pick the grapes, carry them in small panniers to the end of the vine rows and dump them into large straw baskets capable of holding more than 100 pounds.</p>
        <p>The men lift the heavy baskets onto their backs and balancing themselves with long staffs, carry them up the slopes, often using staircases carved into the terraces. The work is unbelievably hard. The terraced vineyards, perched precariously on dangerously steep slopes, were created years before any mechanical conveyances existed.</p>
        <p>Picking begins at 8 A.M. There is a break at 10 for soup and bread and a break at 1 P.M. for lunch. Picking ends around 5. After dinner in the pickers' dining hall, the men and boys who have been selected for trampling the grapes assemble at the lagars. There are six lagars of varying sizes. Usually, two or three are used each night, depending on the quantity of grapes to be crushed.</p>
        <p>The foreman assigns the workers to two teams of six for the larger lagars. Wearing shorts, they line up in two rows in the filled vats, their arms on each others' shoulders. To the slow count of the foreman -- one . . . two . . . -- they begin to trample the grapes, raising their knees in unison out of the cold mixture of juice and grapes, then just as slowly plunging their feet back into it.</p>
        <p>For about 20 minutes they inch their way across the rectangular vat; then, still to the count of the foreman, they walk backward, which helps insure that all the grapes are crushed.</p>
        <p>After two hours, the workers get a break. Jugs of wine are passed around, and cigarettes appear. The second half of the session is freestyle. The accordionist arrives, takes a long draft from the wine jug and begins to play lively old Portuguese songs. The tramplers, working individually or in pairs now, join in singing. The women and young girls who have come to the vat house to hear the music dance with each other alongside the vats. The music is infectious, and soon even the guests join in.</p>
        <p>After an hour and a half, the trampling stops, and the workers go off to their dormitory to sleep until harvesting begins again the next morning. The pickers earn about $120 a week, plus room and board. Trampling the grapes is worth another $10 a night.</p>
        <p>"The pay is low for such difficult work," Mr. Seely said, "but as many as four or five people in one family will come here. They are mostly marginal farmers in their home villages, and what they earn here adds considerably to their income."</p>
        <p>While the tramplers sleep, the grape skins and stalks float to the top of the lagar where they form a tight, almost foot-thick mat. Only an occasional carbon dioxide bubble works through to the surface to indicate that the juice is fermenting actively underneath.</p>
        <p>During the night, the chief wine maker or one of her staff will regularly check the must, as the juice is called. When the alcoholic content has reached about 8 percent, grape brandy is added to stop fermentation. From time to time, a crew of men wielding what look like six-foot-long swizzle sticks punch the grape-skin mat down into the fermenting juice to extract additional color and tannin.</p>
        <p>When the added spirit has increased the alcohol content of the wine to about 20 percent, it is drawn off for barrel aging. The lagars are refilled, and the process begins again.</p>
        <p>At the Quinta do Noval, only grapes destined for the best wine, vintage Port and the rare single-vineyard Nacional vintage Port, go into the lagars for trampling. In fact, grapes from the Nacional vineyard are crushed only in the smallest lagar, one holding about five pipes of wine. A pipe, the tradition measurement for Port, is about 117 gallons, the equivalent of 56 cases of wine.</p>
        <p>Grapes from lesser vineyards and those from as many as 120 outside suppliers are crushed in modern mechanical wine presses.</p>
        <p>In 1993, AXA, a major French insurance group, bought Noval from the van Zeller family, Port makers since the 18th century. The sale included the 360-acre estate, its production buildings and stocks. The van Zellers had begun a modernization program, including replanting the vineyards and building a new bottling plant and a large warehouse or lodge for aging wine, and this has been accelerated by AXA.</p>
        <p>Since the 18th century, the Port business has been divided between the grape growing and wine making here in the mountainous Douro region and the aging, storing and shipping of the wine at Vila Nova de Gaia, across the river from the city of Oporto, on the seacoast about two hours away. Until 1986, Portuguese law forbade the shipping of Port from any place other than Vila Nova de Gaia.</p>
        <p>Gambling on changes in the law, the van Zellers transferred almost all their operations to the estate here in the Douro. AXA has continued the process; eventually, only a small business office and tourist center will remain at Vila Nova de Gaia. Noval wines will be shipped from here via a recently opened auto route, either to the coast or eastward into Spain and the rest of Europe.</p>
        <p>The lagars may seem immutable symbols of Port tradition, but in fact, they have changed, too. Teams of women now take their turn in the vats. The other day, at Fonseca Guimaraens, a nearby quinta, a group of women trod solemnly to their own music; one played a triangle, another a drum and a third a flute.</p>
        <p>Here at the Quinta do Noval, a few guests tried their hand -- or more precisely, their feet -- at trampling grapes. One woman found herself dancing in the thick must with one of the regular tramplers. "I think it was a samba," she said later.</p>
        <p>TASTINGS Paul Thomas Cabernet Sauvignon 1993, Columbia Valley, Washington State. About $16. Paul Thomas started his winery in 1979. In the Washington tradition, he made fruit wines and produced some worthwhile cabernets during the early 1980's. But in 1988, Brian Carter, the wine maker, left, and some critics said the wines suffered as a result. The winery was sold in the late 1980's and then resold in 1993 to David Lake's Columbia Winery in Woodinville, near Seattle. So it's not quite clear who vinified and who finished this particular cabernet. Whoever was responsible, it is a lean, elegant wine, a style much favored by Mr. Lake. Devotees of California cabernets will find this wine to be a departure from the lush, full-bodied style they know. The best Washington cabernets, of which this is an excellent example, have a lot to teach them and other wine enthusiasts as well.</p>
