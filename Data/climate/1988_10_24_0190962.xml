        <p>LEAD: Overshadowed for six years by a popular and aggressive President, Congress regained its voice in the 1987-88 sessions, enacting ground-breaking legislation in areas as diverse as trade policy and welfare, civil rights and arms control.</p>
        <p>Overshadowed for six years by a popular and aggressive President, Congress regained its voice in the 1987-88 sessions, enacting ground-breaking legislation in areas as diverse as trade policy and welfare, civil rights and arms control.</p>
        <p>The 100th Congress, which adjourned early Saturday morning, drew rave reviews from Democratic leaders, and many Republicans were only slightly less effusive.</p>
        <p>Even Representative Dick Cheney, Republican of Wyoming, who said some of the two years had been marred by partisan antagonism in the House, agreed it had been a ''workmanlike job,'' adding, ''Everybody can walk away and claim some credit.'' Democratic Agenda</p>
        <p>Much of the major legislation adopted in the two sessions closely tracks an agenda mapped out by Democratic leaders in January 1987 as they moved to capitalize on their party's return to control in the Senate and the rise in the House of a new and more combative Democratic Speaker, Jim Wright of Texas.</p>
        <p>They were determined to establish a record on which their Presidential candidate could run in 1988, or as Representative Tony Coelho of California, the House Democratic whip, put it, ''to show that we can govern.''</p>
        <p>But the uncommonly productive sessions also owe a great deal to a convergence of outside factors that drove the White House and Congressional leaders of both parties into an American version of a coalition Government. The Iran-contra scandal, the dramatic improvement in American-Soviet relations and the October 1987 stock market crash each changed the dynamics within Congress and the relationship between Congress and the Administration. Compromise Was Fostered</p>
        <p>As a result, the two parties and the two branches of government became more dependent on each other to accomplish their goals.</p>
        <p>''They got more done than they had any reason to expect,'' said Thomas E. Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution. ''Divided government fostered compromise rather than prevented it.''</p>
        <p>The Democrats began to flex their political muscle early in 1987.</p>
        <p>Congress overrode President Reagan's vetoes of two items on the leadership agenda - a highway financing bill and legislation to clean up the nation's waterways. Then in October 1987, after a confirmation battle that became virtually a referendum on the Reagan Administration's judicial philosophy, the Senate rejected the President's nomination of Robert H. Bork to the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>This year the 100th Congress approved the first major change in civil rights laws in two decades and for the first time put teeth in the fair housing law.</p>
        <p>But Democrats did not succeed entirely on their own terms.</p>
        <p>In some cases, most notably the overhaul of the welfare system and the expansion of the Medicare program to cover catastrophic illnesses, the final shape of legislation long sought by Democrats also bore the stamp of Republicans and the White House. But Republicans did block Democratic initiatives to overhaul the campaign financing laws, increase the minimum wage, mandate unpaid leave for working parents and establish Federal standards for subsidized day care centers. Many Issues Still Unresolved</p>
        <p>These issues are likely to come up again in the 101st Congress along with changes in banking laws and control of air pollution and acid rain, two areas where jurisdictional and geographic conflicts rather than any clear-cut partisan differences prevented action in 1987 or 1988.</p>
        <p>The next Congress is also likely to consider proposals in which the Federal Government would help pay the costs of long-term home health care and providing protection for the 37 million Americans who lack health insurance but do not qualify under the Medicaid program that covers medical aid for the poor.</p>
        <p>In foreign affairs, the 100th Congress generally proved the maxim that partisanship stops at the water's edge. Although Senate Democrats staged a noisy battle in mid-1987 to invoke the War Powers Act over President Reagan's decision to put American flags on Kuwaiti tankers, the effort was as much an attempt to assert institutional prerogatives as it was a disagreement with the substance of the Administration's Persian Gulf policy.</p>
        <p>The House never went that far, and ultimately both chambers backed the President. ''You could call it a Congressional unwillingness to accept responsibility for not going along,'' said Mr. Cheney, who holds the No. 3 post in the House Republican leadership. Aid to Nicaraguan Rebels</p>
        <p>The marked exception to the bipartisan foreign policy rule was the seemingly endless battle between Congress and the President over aid to the Nicaraguan rebels. Although the issue appears to have little impact on the American public, it has, from nearly the beginning of the Reagan Administration, been a bitter and divisive one in Congress. That is particularly true in the House, where this year it strained already frayed relations between the Republican minority and the Speaker to nearly the breaking point.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wright took a personal and highly visible role in trying to promote peace talks between the rebels and the Nicaraguan Government while the Administration fought repeatedly to win approval for sending the rebels arms. With both Congress and the White House wearied by the struggle over Central American policy, and the contras themselves in political disarray, lawmakers resolved the issue for this year with a compromise that pleases no one, a package of $27 million for food, clothing, shelter and medical aid for the rebels that bars any military supplies.</p>
        <p>The legislative finale of the sessions, a sweeping drug bill that gradually shifts priorities in the fight against drugs from law enforcement to education, rehabilitation and other efforts to reduce demand, was a bipartisan undertaking. Born of a desire in both parties to wage yet another election year war against drugs, the bill was initially laden with punitive provisions of dubious constitutionality.</p>
        <p>But the product, for all the agony and delay in enacting it, is probably the most sophisticated effort by the Federal Government to address the nation's drug problem. The legislation is also noteworthy for being a creation of Congress. Euphoria Evident</p>
        <p>The euphoria of completing the measure was evident as leaders from both parties assessed the Congress.</p>
        <p>''It was an outstanding Congress,'' said the Senate majority leader, Robert Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia. ''The best probably since L.B.J.,'' when major civil rights and poverty legislation was approved.</p>
        <p>The achievements of the 100th Congress also have sentimental significance for Mr. Byrd, who will be leaving his leadership post next year and assuming the chairmanship of the Senate Appropriations Committee. Republicans, who preferred to use as their benchmark Ronald Reagan's first year in office rather than Lyndon B. Johnson's, were equally proud.</p>
        <p>''It's been an incredibly good session,'' said Senator Pete Domenici, a New Mexico Republican. Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the House Republican leader, said, ''From the standpoint of big, significant pieces of legislation, it was no small achievement.''</p>
        <p>Although the fact that Congress and the White House are controlled by different parties is by no means unusual in American politics, the set of circumstances that drove Congress and the two branches into an unwilling partnership in the past two years was unique.</p>
        <p>Disclosues about the Iran-contra arms deals weakened the President's prestige and distracted the White House, as a riveted nation watched Congress unravel the most embarrassing secrets of the Reagan years. But the political damage was not sufficient to prevent close cooperation six months later as Senate Democrats helped the President gain approval of an arms control treaty with the Soviet Union that will eliminate medium- and shorter-range land-based nuclear missiles. Impact of the Crash</p>
        <p>It was the 1987 stock market crash, however, that gave rise to what many lawmakers believe is the single most significant achievement of the 100th Congress and indeed the one that paved the way for action on most of the major legislation adopted in 1988, including prompt passage of all 13 spending bills for the first time in more than a decade.</p>
        <p>With the financial markets in turmoil over the specter of mounting trade and budget deficits, Congress and the White House began marathon negotiations in late October 1987 to hammer out a deficit reduction plan.</p>
        <p>''Contrary to popular belief, Congress does not act on its own in these matters,'' said Representative William H. Gray, the Pennsylvania Democrat who is chairman of the House Budget Committee and is leaving the panel next year. ''It takes the President and the executive branch to nod or wink or blink approval before members of Congress will walk down to that voting well on the floor and make choices.''</p>
        <p>The budget negotiations produced a two-year agreement covering the 1988 and 1989 fiscal years but will not cover the budget that the 101st Congress must begin work on in January. The agreement set overall spending and deficit levels as well as spending levels for key budget areas such as defense, foreign aid and certain domestic programs.</p>
        <p>''Once you've got those five numbers you can do business around here,'' said Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who heads the Senate Armed Services Committee. ''But next year the real bills are going to come due, and the next President is going to need a shovel, because there is a lot to clean up fiscally.'' Problems for Next President</p>
        <p>That view is widely shared by lawmakers in both parties who recall the bitter guns versus butter arguments that polarized Congress for most of the Reagan years and quite nearly paralyzed it in mid-1987. Their hope is that the next President will participate in similar negotiations early in the next Congress, and their concern is what may happen if he does not.</p>
        <p>''The next President is going to have to make some strategic decisions at the very beginning of his term,'' Mr. Cheney said. ''Either he works out some type of umbrella accord or sends up his own budget and battles over priorities. At this point, I don't see the broad outlines of any kind of agreement.''</p>
        <p>Whatever the new President's priorities, he and Congress will face some rigid budget realities that leave little room for maneuvering without the tax increase that Vice President Bush has vowed he will not accept and that Gov. Michael S. Dukakis has said would be only a last resort.</p>
        <p>A bailout of the troubled savings and loan industry, regarded as essential by lawmakers in both parties, is estimated to cost anywhere from $50 billion to $100 billion. New spending is also likely on child care, education and environmental programs that both Presidential candidates have endorsed.</p>
        <p>But Congress this year came close to exceeding the $146 billion deficit limit imposed by the 1987 balanced budget law, and next year's deficit limit is substantially lower: $110 billion. Under the law, a breach would trigger automatic cuts in both domestic and military programs.</p>
        <p>''Leon Panetta has my prayers,'' Mr. Gray said, referring to the California Democrat who is expected to succeed him as chairman of the Budget Committee in the 101st Congress. ''There is nothing left but tough choices.''</p>
