        <p>LEAD: ALTHOUGH some initiatives now under way could slightly improve conditions along New Jersey's coastline by next year, marine scientists and others say the worst of the state's coastal pollution problems will persist for years, or even decades.</p>
        <p>ALTHOUGH some initiatives now under way could slightly improve conditions along New Jersey's coastline by next year, marine scientists and others say the worst of the state's coastal pollution problems will persist for years, or even decades.</p>
        <p>According to scientists, the pollution is the result of toxic chemical waste from motor vehicles, local storm sewers and industrial outfall lines along rivers, bays and harbors, as well as sewage effluent, greases and oils, discharges from ships, boats and marinas, pesticides and fertilizers from farms and lawns and atmospheric fallout, like acid rain.</p>
        <p>While studies are under way to measure the amounts of the pollutants and to devise ways of controlling them, researchers say that efforts to address the problem are complicated by the rapid population growth in coastal areas and the lengthy process involved in building treatment facilities.</p>
        <p>Dr. John B. Pearce, deputy director of marine fisheries research at the Federal Northeast Fisheries Center at Woods Hole, Mass., who until three years ago was with the National Marine Fisheries Laboratory at Sandy Hook, said coastal pollution was ''a much more pervasive and long-term problem than anyone has indicated so far.''</p>
        <p>''You're looking at decadal increments of improvements,'' he said, ''certainly nothing that anyone can glibly say will go away in a year or two.''  'Assaults on the Environment'</p>
        <p>Christopher J. Daggett, the new Commissioner of the state's Department of Environmental Protection, and former regional administrator of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, said that the medical waste this summer ''merely highlighted what many people had sensed for years - that a combination of our assaults on the environment would return home. It has.''</p>
        <p>By the middle of this month, many segments of the Shore's economy, which last year generated $7.7 billion, had declined 20 to 60 percent from last year, merchants and tourism officials say. Hardest hit were the Monmouth County communities between Sandy Hook and Belmar, they say.</p>
        <p>Dr. Pearce noted that the pollution has severely affected the New York Bight, a relatively shallow basin of the Atlantic Ocean extending from Montauk Point, L.I., to Cape May. The bight includes all the state's estuaries and extends 65 to 95 miles east of the coastline to the edge of the continental shelf.</p>
        <p>Many of the pollutants affecting the area are generically knownto marine scientists as ''nonpoint sources'' of pollution: they either do not have specific points of entry or, as in the case of combined sewer outfalls, which are the mingling of raw sewage and toxic pollutants from street sewers during heavy rains, their voluminous discharges cannot be readily measured.  Swept Southward With Tides</p>
        <p>These combined sewer outfalls are found at old sewage treatment plants, generally north of the Raritan River and throughout New York Harbor. Their discharges, scientists say, are swept southward with the tides and storms. Nonpoint sources like these present real health dangers to bathers and, at constant sublethal levels, to edible varieties of shellfish and fin fish.</p>
        <p>Among other things, said John A. Tiedemann, an environmental oceanographer with Rutgers University's Cooperative Extension Service in Toms River, the polluted broth is rich in such nutrients as nitrates and phosphates. The nutrients fertilize naturally occurring algae, he explained, causing widespread algae blooms that decompose and consume large amounts of oxygen in the water. The oxygen depletion starves essential bottom-dwelling organisms and other sea life and causes fish kills, like the massive one in the New York Bight in 1976, he said.</p>
        <p>Since then, Mr. Tiedemann said, there have been numerous other incidents, not the least of which were two that occurred in Raritan Bay this summer, killing a million fish.</p>
        <p>The perennial bacterial contamination of the state's ocean coastline, while usually below the human danger level of 200 colonies of fecal coliform per 100 milliliters of water, nonetheless has been enough to have closed inshore waters to shellfish harvesting up to a mile offshore since the 1970's. In all, more than 100,000 of the state's 395,000 acres of rivers and bays are closed to shellfishing, according to Rutgers University researchers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tiedemann predicted that the identification of nonpoint sources of pollution, which is under way in several local and state studies that began within the last year, would take five years to complete. Another five years will be needed to implement treatment strategies to halt or control the sources, he said.  'Probably Into the Billions'</p>
        <p>Mr. Daggett said the job could take about 12 years, adding that ''it will cost hundreds of millions of dollars, probably into the billions, to construct the facilities to properly treat these wastes and enforce regulations.''</p>
        <p>Residents of New Jersey and New York ''will have to be willing to be taxed rather heavily to get the job done,'' Mr. Daggett said. ''Whether they are willing to do so is the big question now.'' Meanwhile, others, including Donald A. Deieso, Mr. Daggett's assistant commissioner for environmental quality, pointed out that small but significant signs had appeared in recent months that could represent a more serious effort to tackle the monumental cleanup task that lies ahead.</p>
        <p>The following were among those signs:</p>
        <p>* The signing by Governor Kean this month of a $33.5 million Storm Water Mapping Act that will start the lengthy process of bringing local outfall lines under control.</p>
        <p>* A pending $30 million measure in the Legislature to extend several sewage outfall lines farther out into the Atlantic in Monmouth County. Environmentalists oppose it as wasteful and ineffective over all.</p>
        <p>* A proposed $2 million legislative appropriation to set up a waste pretreatment program in the Department of Environmental Protection to discourage industries from discharging heavy metals and other toxic substances into local sewage plants. Cleaner sludge in three to four years from now will increase the possibilities of recycling it or otherwise safely disposing of it on land rather than at sea.</p>
        <p>* A new program in Cape May County that treats storm water with chlorine and affixes screens to filter the water so that the effluent is less toxic and floatables are trapped. Other coastal communities are being urged to follow suit.  Coastal Commission Proposed Mr. Kean has proposed a 15-member Coastal Commission to regulate development along the coast and to administer the millions of dollars annually for local pollution-related and nonpollution-related grants and awards.</p>
        <p>While many of the measures contained in the Coastal Commission proposal have been passed by the Legislature in the last year and a half, the commission proposal itself has repeatedly failed to come to a vote in the Senate or the Assembly.</p>
        <p>John N. Samerjan, a spokesman for the Governor, said that Mr. Kean ''considers the commission the single most important piece of ocean legislation in his administration, so he's very frustrated about this.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Pearce said he doubted whether metropolitan regions could fully seize control of the coastal pollution problem in the near future. Achieving this, he said, would require dramatic changes in reducing all categories of waste flows from homes and industries, in transportation patterns and energy use and strict moratoriums on new construction within the coastal zone. ''It is a vastly complex problem to solve,'' Dr. Pearce said. ''There has to be some much larger program developed to handle it and, so far, it hasn't even been decided if it should be a Federal or a state problem.''  Increasing Population</p>
        <p>John H. Gentile, a marine pollution expert at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute who is working on the cleanup of Boston Harbor, said the major complicating factor in solving coastal pollution was an increasing coastal population. In the next 10 years, Mr. Gentile said, 75 percent of the nation's population, including that of New Jersey and New York, will live within 50 to 75 miles of the coastline.</p>
        <p>Noting that the lead time required to complete a new sewage and storm-water treatment system was 10 to 12 years, he said that ''what this all means for New Jersey is that treatment facilities to take care of the problem will be tremendously burdened by even larger populations.'' He added, ''It's a major dilemma.'' For the short term, Mr. Tiedemann said, ''The real and perceived problem of ocean pollution and the damage it has caused to the Shore's economy will definitely extend into next summer at least.''</p>
