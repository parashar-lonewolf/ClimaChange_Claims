        <p>Macy's Origins</p>
        <p>Q. Until a few years ago, the word ''Macy's'' and a red star were faintly visible over the doorway of the narrow nine-story building at 56 West 14th Street. Was this the original site of the ''world's largest department store''?</p>
        <p>A. That red star should look familiar. Though the original storefront was actually around the corner, this building was part of Macy's early and rapid expansion before construction of its Herald Square store and the move uptown in 1902.</p>

        <p>Macy's Origins</p>
        <p>Q. Until a few years ago, the word ''Macy's'' and a red star were faintly visible over the doorway of the narrow nine-story building at 56 West 14th Street. Was this the original site of the ''world's largest department store''?</p>
        <p>A. That red star should look familiar. Though the original storefront was actually around the corner, this building was part of Macy's early and rapid expansion before construction of its Herald Square store and the move uptown in 1902.</p>
        <p>Rowland Hussey Macy, a Nantucket Quaker, was born in 1837, and at  age 15 went to sea aboard the Emily Morgan, a whaling vessel bound for Cape Town and the South Pacific. Macy returned four years later with about $500 in savings -- and a five-pointed red star tattooed on his forearm.</p>
        <p>After a succession of speculative disappointments and merchandising failures in Boston, Macy opened his first New York store in 1858 at 204 Sixth Avenue, between 13th and 14th Streets, north of the city's established dry-goods district. Within a few years, he began to use the red star from his whaling days as his trademark.</p>
        <p>Macy's introduced such commercial innovations as a money-back guarantee, fixed prices and cash-only sales, and sewed made-to-measure garments in a factory on the premises. The business prospered. By the time Macy died in 1877, the store had expanded into a complex of 11 connected buildings on 13th and 14th Streets, including No. 56, and offered a vast selection of merchandise sold in different ''departments.'' The No. 56 storefront is now occupied by a cut-rate Macy's descendant, 99-Cent City.</p>
        <p>Counting Sheep Rocks</p>
        <p>Q. I am struck by the beauty of the dark, rugged outcrops that jut from Central Park's grassy, sculptured slopes. Were they placed there by the park's 19th-century landscapers, or are they part of the natural terrain?</p>
        <p>A. The ancient outcrops are the only element of Central Park that is not man-made, and they predate the designs of Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux by about 450 million years. To ponder them is to gaze back in time at the deeply eroded remnants of mountains that were once as prominent as the Himalayas are today.</p>
        <p>The park's rocky knolls are composed of metamorphic and igneous bedrock -- primarily mica schist, gneiss, granite and metamorphosed oceanic material -- which formed at the core of a mountain range that was pushed up when eastern North America collided with volcanic terrain about 450 million years ago, according to Charles Merguerian, a professor of structural geology at Hofstra University. This continous spine of crystalline bedrock, called the ''Manhattan Prong,'' runs just below the surface of the island, supporting the weight of skyscrapers and emerging from the earth in Central Park and areas north of it, like Coogan's Bluff and Inwood Hill.</p>
        <p>In the area where Central Park now sits, the mountainous bedrock ridge -- part of the earth's continuous outer crust -- was greatly eroded  by succeeding eons, Mr. Merguerian said. At least five great glacial ice sheets that advanced from the northwest and northeast during the Pleistocene epoch, 200,000 to 20,000 years ago, dramatically altered the terrain, scraping, gouging and rounding the contours of the exposed bedrock and scattering huge boulders on the landscape.</p>
        <p>Mr. Merguerian explained that the grinding effect of the advancing ice mass transformed many of the Central Park outcrops into asymmetrical hulks called ''roches moutonnees,'' or sheep-shaped rocks. The south, or ''lee'' side of these outcrops, which were downstream of the advancing glaciers, are steep and craggy, while the north, or ''stoss,'' sides tend to be smoothly polished and striated.</p>
        <p>Subway Pit Stops</p>
        <p>Q. When -- and for that matter, where -- do token booth clerks in the subway go to the bathroom?</p>
        <p>A. Token clerks are encouraged to use the bathroom before their shift, or on their scheduled lunch break, said Termaine Garden, a Transit Authority spokesman, adding that all 468 subway stations have employee restrooms. But there are dire occasions when clerks working alone in a booth simply must absent themselves for what the Transit Authority delicately calls ''a comfort relief.''</p>
        <p>On those occasions, the clerk must telephone a supervisor at the nearest field office and wait for . . . er . . . relief to arrive before leaving the booth.</p>
        <p>Minutes? Hours? ''It can take a while,'' Mr. Garden said.</p>
