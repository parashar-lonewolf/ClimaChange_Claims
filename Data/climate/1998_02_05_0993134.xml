        <p>The Clinton Administration announced a research effort with automotive companies today to improve sharply the fuel economy of sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and mini-vans, using techniques borrowed from the Pentagon.</p>

        <p>The Clinton Administration announced a research effort with automotive companies today to improve sharply the fuel economy of sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and mini-vans, using techniques borrowed from the Pentagon.</p>
        <p>Secretary of Energy Federico F. Pena said the goal would be to increase by 50 percent by 2004 the number of miles that these so-called light trucks can travel on a gallon of gasoline or diesel. With sales of light trucks rising quickly, improved fuel economy for them would conserve energy while curbing emissions of carbon dioxide, the main gas linked to global warming.</p>
        <p>The plan announced today involves Government work in partnership with the Big Three automobile companies and seven regional consortiums of component manufacturers and high-technology start-up companies.</p>
        <p>The Energy Department and the Transportation Department will take over a research program on medium- and heavy-duty vehicles from the Defense Department. The research into heavy trucks will continue, with the goal of doubling the gas mileage of 18-wheel trucks. The military has already developed a Humvee that can go twice as far as previous models on a gallon of fuel, with better acceleration, quieter operation and less pollution.</p>
        <p>''It's important for us to focus on light trucks and heavy trucks,'' said Mr. Pena, who said trucks were the fastest-growing segment of the transportation business. Gasoline consumption by cars is projected to show little change through 2020, while light truck consumption of gasoline is expected to rise steeply, according to a chart that Mr. Pena displayed. The new research effort into light trucks was mostly put together in the last two months, in response to rising sales of light trucks and growing public interest in them, Federal officials said.</p>
        <p>The Government defines sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and mini-vans as light trucks, though mini-vans and a few sport utility vehicles are actually based on car designs.</p>
        <p>The Administration has asked Congress for $50 million for truck research, to be matched by at least $50 million from the auto industry. But if Congress rejects that request, the Administration plans to conduct light truck research anyway, on a smaller scale. The auto industry has said it would only produce high-mileage vehicles if they can be made for a price consumers would pay.</p>
        <p>According to the Energy Department, about 2 million of the approximately 9.5 million barrels of fuel used daily for highway vehicles goes into trucks and buses, and nearly 3 million into ''light trucks,'' many of which are household vehicles.</p>
        <p>The United States agreed at an international conference last December in Kyoto, Japan, to curb its man-made emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that are believed to contribute to global warming. According to a research paper last autumn by an Environmental Protection Agency official, light trucks will account for the biggest increase in so-called greenhouse gas emissions by the United States over the next two decades.</p>
        <p>The new program is meant to do for heavier vehicles what the Partnership for the Next Generation Vehicle, begun four years ago, is expected to do for cars. That program, undertaken by the Government, with the Ford Motor Company, the Chrysler Corporation and the Corporation, is meant to develop by 2004 a production-ready prototype of a 5-passenger car that would get up to 80 miles a gallon with no sacrifice in safety, performance, convenience or cost.</p>
        <p>The new research effort and the existing Next Generation partnership are likely to use similar technologies. The main one, demonstrated in the Humvee, involves switching from an internal-combustion engine to a hybrid system, in which a small engine, running on gasoline or diesel fuel, operates steadily to run an electric generator and charge batteries or feed drive motors on the wheels.</p>
        <p>When the vehicle needs extra power, it draws it from the batteries, and when it needs no power, for example, when it has stopped, the internal combustion engine keeps running to feed the batteries. Because the engine runs at nearly constant speed, it is cleaner and more efficient.</p>
        <p>The Humvee, built by PEI Electronics, an independent company spun off by Chrysler earlier this year, will go approximately 18 miles on a gallon of diesel fuel instead of 9; accelerates from 0 to 50 miles an hour in seven seconds instead of 14, and can climb a 60 percent grade at 17 m.p.h. instead of 6 m.p.h. It can also run 20 miles on batteries alone, which suits the Pentagon's needs, because in that mode it is nearly silent and is also hard to find with a heat-detection system.</p>
        <p>Advanced Vehicle Systems of Chattanooga, Tenn., showed off a 22-foot hybrid electric bus at the press conference here, with a turbine that runs on natural gas for recharging the batteries. It has greatly reduced emissions of the pollutants that cause smog and the ones linked to global warming.</p>
