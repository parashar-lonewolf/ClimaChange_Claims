        <p>Praxair Inc. sweetened its hostile bid for CBI Industries yesterday and pressured CBI to accept it by imposing a deadline of tomorrow. Praxair, based in Danbury, Conn., increased its offer by $1 a share, to $33. If CBI does not accept by 5 P.M. tomorrow, Praxair's bid, valued at about $2.2 billion, plus the assumption of $750 million in CBI debt, will revert to the original $32-a-share  offer that was rejected on Nov. 16. A spokesman for CBI, which is based in Oak Brook, Ill., was unavailable for comment. The acquisition would combine CBI, the world's largest maker of carbon dioxide, with Praxair, one of the world's largest producers of industrial gases. CBI shares were up $1 at $32.375 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
