        <p>William Clay Ford Jr. said today that a credibility gap on environmental issues had eroded America's love for cars. Mr. Ford, the chairman and chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, also said he wanted to ''lower the temperature'' of the industry's often contentious relationship with California regulators.</p>
        <p>''During the nearly 25 years I've worked in the industry, the love affair that people have had with automobiles has in some ways grown stale, and some would say it's even dying,'' Mr. Ford said. ''If you remember, in California, people used to write songs about T-Birds and Corvettes. Today, they write regulations.''</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, Gov. Gray Davis of California signed a landmark bill that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by the 2008 model year, the first such action at the state or federal level. The auto industry is greatly concerned with the potential cost of the measure and said it would probably challenge it in court. California regulators are also intent on forcing carmakers to produce electric vehicles, but that plan, due to start this year, has been delayed by a court challenge from General Motors and DaimlerChrysler.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford's speech, at an industry management conference in this northwestern Michigan resort area, was his most forceful on environmental issues since becoming chief executive of the financially struggling company in October.</p>
        <p>Before taking the helm, he was one of the few industry executives to talk about issues like global warming. But groups like the Sierra Club have bitterly criticized Mr. Ford recently because of his company's participation in lobbying campaigns against increased federal gas-mileage standards and California's initiatives.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford, while saying he did not support the California plan to force companies to produce zero-emission vehicles like electric cars, said his industry did face a problem on environmentalism akin to that of others on accounting and corporate governance. And he urged a more cooperative approach with regulators.</p>
        <p>''The same basic issue, lack of trust, is there,'' he said, but added that he thought the auto industry was making a good-faith effort to solve the problem by pushing hard on two technologies: vehicles with hybrid engines, which combine gasoline and electricity, and fuel cells, a clean but complex technology that draws power from hydrogen. Toyota and Honda are already selling hybrid cars, and Ford has said it will start selling a hybrid sport utility vehicle at the end of next year.</p>
        <p>''New technology could rejuvenate the love affair people have with automobiles by making it possible for them not just to love their own cars,'' he said, ''but to love everyone else's as well.''</p>
        <p>Several other top executives also spoke at the conference. Dieter Zetsche, the Chrysler unit's chief executive, said the company would make bolstering its car business a priority. Chrysler derives 70 percent of its sales from light trucks -- S.U.V.'s, minivans and pickup trucks. That share is far higher than in the industry at large; last year was the first time light-truck sales exceeded those of passenger cars, a trend that has been reducing the gas mileage of the average new vehicle.</p>
        <p>''We will refocus our attention on passenger cars,'' Mr. Zetsche said. ''Two-thirds of the 21 new and refreshed vehicles we will soon introduce will be car-based.''</p>
        <p>But that does not mean they will be passenger cars, a Chrysler spokesman said. The term ''car-based'' is a confusing one in Detroit. Small S.U.V.'s are considered car-based in their design because their underbodies have more in common with a car and lack the stiff steel beams of pickup trucks. But many car-based vehicles, including Chrysler's PT Cruiser and the Audi Allroad, can still be configured to be regulated as light trucks and permitted to use, on average, 33 percent more gasoline.</p>
        <p>In another speech today, Hiroyuki Yoshino, president and chief executive of the Honda Motor Company, said China was perhaps his company's biggest future growth market.</p>
        <p>''Efforts to build a strong foundation in China have been very similar to the early stages of our operations in America,'' he said, adding that ''for the coming years, business in China will be at the forefront of my attention.''</p>
        <p>Honda's goal is to have 20 million new customers annually by the fiscal year ending in March 2005, up from 12.7 million in the most recent fiscal year.</p>
        <p>''Significantly, half of these customers, 10 million, will be in Asia,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Robert A. Lutz, vice chairman of General Motors, said his company would not match Chrysler's new seven-year, 70,000-mile powertrain warranty because he thought such a plan would be too costly and not lure enough buyers. Mr. Lutz, 70, the innovative former Chrysler president who has reinvigorated G.M.'s product development operations, said he might also stay beyond the two years left on his three-year contract.</p>
        <p>Several executives also extolled diesel technology, which is prevalent in Europe but has faced regulatory hurdles here and among some has conjured up bad memories of the ''dirty diesels'' of the 1970's. Carmakers say the modern diesel engine is much cleaner.</p>
        <p>''We should get diesels in the mix because it's one way we could get 10 to 15 percent fuel-economy improvement,'' Mr. Lutz said. But new clean air regulations, to take effect in 2007, are seen as a deterrent.</p>
        <p>No manufacturer could meet the new rules now, Mr. Zetsche said, adding, ''Either we find a way to meet those extremely demanding targets or we should have meaningful discussions with legislators to see if this really makes sense.''</p>
