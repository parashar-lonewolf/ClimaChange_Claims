        <p>ABC News has agreed to remove an interview with schoolchildren from a coming special on the environment after their parents said they had been misled about the nature of the questioning when they permitted their children to participate.</p>
        <p>Called ''Tampering With Nature,'' the special is to be shown on Friday night. Its host will be John Stossel, who has frequently angered environmentalists for painting them as scaremongers and for questioning the reasoning behind some of their positions.</p>
        <p>The children -- about 10 of them ages 8 to 17 -- were interviewed in Santa Monica, Calif., on Earth Day.</p>
        <p>Several parents said they had given ABC permission to interview their children after they had been led to believe that their children would be asked straightforward questions about environmental issues. The parents said they were surprised, however, when Mr. Stossel asked ''leading questions to get them to say'' what he wanted, namely, they said, that teachings about the environment were scaring them.</p>
        <p>Brad Neal, who was at the interview session with his children Samantha, 8, and Brandon, 10, said: ''He led them. He was asking the kids, 'Isn't it true that scientists all agree that the greenhouse effect is the result of fossil fuel burning?' It was like he was trying to get them to come out and say an incorrect answer.''</p>
        <p>In a letter to Mr. Stossel, the parents said that they had not initially been told that he would be involved and that they were revoking their permission.</p>
        <p>Some of the parents took their concerns to the Environmental Working Group, a watchdog group that helped them take their complaint public on Monday.</p>
        <p>Last summer, the Environmental Working Group raised questions about a report by Mr. Stossel that supposedly debunked the assumed benefits of organic produce, but was based, in part, on results from ''research'' that was never conducted. Mr. Stossel was reprimanded, and he later apologized on ABC's ''20/20.''</p>
        <p>In a statement yesterday, ABC said that despite its decision to scrap the interview with the children -- part of a four-minute segment about the teaching of environmental science -- it did not think Mr. Stossel or his team had done anything wrong.</p>
        <p>The network said no parent objected ''until the week of our broadcast, after they had spoken with activists.''</p>
        <p>But, ABC said, it wanted to be sensitive to the parents' objections.</p>
