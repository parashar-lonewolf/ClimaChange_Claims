        <p>Toyota announced today that it would start selling a hybrid version of a small S.U.V., the RX 330 from its Lexus brand, by the end of next year.</p>
        <p>The Lexus hybrid is likely to be the first luxury auto to use the highly fuel efficient technology and the second such S.U.V. on the market. Hybrids supplement the internal combustion engine with electric power.</p>
        <p>''You can't deny the hybrid potential,'' said James E. Press, the executive vice president of Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. ''The Prius proves the business case,'' he added, referring to the company's current hybrid, the subcompact Toyota Prius. ''We're not losing money on Prius. It works, Customers love it.''</p>
        <p>The plan, described at a press preview of the North American International Auto Show in Detroit this week, was part of a flurry of announcements here about fuel efficient technologies. Which particular technology was being talked up depended on which automaker was doing the talking.</p>
        <p>On the hybrid front, General Motors said Monday that it would make its first foray into hybrids by offering the technology as an option on the Saturn Vue S.U.V. in 2005. G.M. also plans to offer more limited forms of electric power in four other high-volume models by 2007, with a target of improving fuel economy by at least 12 percent.</p>
        <p>Toyota and Honda, which began offering hybrid vehicles in the late 1990's, have been the only two automakers to offer hybrid power so far. The Ford Motor Company plans to sell a hybrid version of its Escape S.U.V. in December.</p>
        <p>The public relations frenzy over fuel efficiency comes in the face of increasing regulatory and social pressures to improve fuel economy and reduce emissions. European executives, accustomed to wide acceptance of fuel-efficient diesel engines in their markets, said they hoped for a diesel renaissance in the United States.</p>
        <p>Dieter Zetsche, chief executive of the Chrysler Group unit of DaimlerChrysler, said that he still had considerable doubts about the business case for hybrids -- increased government tax incentives are seen as crucial to their future growth -- and that he believed that modern advances in diesel engines were more promising.</p>
        <p>''We do believe diesel represents a great opportunity for the country altogether; this certainly would be something that would make sense,'' Mr. Zetsche said. His company plans to start selling about 5,000 diesel versions of its Liberty S.U.V. in 2004. And Chrysler's corporate cousin, Mercedes, said this week that it would offer a limited number of diesels on the E-Class sedan in 2004.</p>
        <p>Diesels are more fuel efficient than standard gasoline-fueled cars and, because of that, would reduce emissions of carbon, which is believed by many scientists to add to global warming. But environmental groups contend that diesels still have unacceptably high emissions of smog-forming pollutants.</p>
        <p>Rick Wagoner, chief executive of G.M., was pessimistic about the prospects for the technology in the United States. ''Our read from Washington, the environmental communities, has not been very constructive on diesels, to put it mildly,'' he said. ''We're not anti-diesel, but we're somewhat guarded.''</p>
        <p>''Our latest check on this wouldn't indicate there's a groundswell to support it,'' he added.</p>
