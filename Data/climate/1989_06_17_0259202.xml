        <p>LEAD: The sun shone down benevolently on the people yesterday afternoon.

But the people were not fooled.</p>
        <p>The sun shone down benevolently on the people yesterday afternoon. This happened at 12:46, and the people, almost as one, drew in their umbrellas, peeled off their jackets, snapped on their shades and peered from the sidewalks below with confused, even amazed faces. But the people were not fooled.</p>
        <p>They knew it had been drizzling and misting and pouring almost constantly around New York City for a month and a half. And they knew that this is a city of extremes. So they took in a few hours of bright sunshine - on steps, at outdoor lunches - considered it a brief reprieve and headed back indoors, braced for more rain.</p>
        <p>It has been a season of adjustment. Business is off for those who sell air conditioners and for those who wash cars. Joseph Maruca, already worried about business after last summer's pollution scare, has not had much traffic at Maruca's Tomato Pies, his pizza stand on the boardwalk in Seaside Park on the New Jersey shore.</p>
        <p>On Long Island yesterday, the Nassau County Department of Health closed four beaches and warned against swimming at several others because the rain had caused New York City's sewers to overflow, washing up debris onto the North Shore.</p>
        <p>The rain and humidity have bred more black flies in the Catskill Mountains and more gypsy moths everywhere. In Cherry Hill, N.J., Brenda Lane could not have the outdoor wedding she had dreamed of. Emily Giske has not been able to set up shop outside libraries and near parks to gather 10,000 signatures for Richard Ravitch, the New York mayoral candidate.</p>
        <p>But none of their misery compares to Brian Freeling's. He is a bicycle messenger.</p>
        <p>''I've really been hating this world lately,'' he said yesterday.</p>
        <p>One thing is for sure. That popular refrain, ''We needed the rain,'' is no longer fashionable. After a dry winter that prompted warnings of a drought as recently as the middle of May, it rained 10.24 inches in May, nearly three times the norm, and 7.12 inches in the first half of June, more than double the norm. The reservoir levels are now at 98.1 percent, and that number is likely to go up before it goes down.</p>
        <p>The National Weather Service said a slow weather pattern has maintained the southerly flow of moist air into the region, and it predicted another thunderstorm for today.</p>
        <p>''It kind of fits,'' said Michele Kreisler, a Princeton University senior working in Manhattan for the summer. ''Same old dreary New York.'' Still, if people were not happy about so much gray in their midst, some are finding it easy to take it in stride. The umbrella business has obviously been booming. The Regency movie house on Broadway near 68th Street has admitted more midday dreamers than usual to see ''Field of Dreams.'' The Tanning Loft in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn, like most tanning salons, is burning the artificial light late and long. A Hit in the Mist</p>
        <p>The Mets and the Yankees are notcomplaining. On Wednesday night, the Mets won a six-and-a-half inning game that ended when the rains came with them conveniently ahead, 2-0. On the same night, in Baltimore, the Yankees' Ken Phelps hit a fly ball that the outfielder Phil Bradley simply could not see in dense fog. It was the ninth inning, and the Yankees had the bases loaded.</p>
        <p>At the observation deck on the 86th floor of the Empire State Building yesterday, the customers were glad when the sun came out, as they were finally able to see New York clearly - or somewhat. A haze up high seemed to foretell a switch back to rain.</p>
        <p>Outside the New York Public Library on 42d Street yesterday, Andrea Reithmayr, a freelance photo editor, said the rain had not disturbed her life, but she said the weather was but one more thing to worry about.</p>
        <p>''It's the greenhouse effect,'' she said. ''I remember when it snowed in the winter, rained in the spring and then the sun came out. Now everything's out of whack.''</p>
        <p>But sitting nearby at a table, Trinette and Maurice Kalker, visiting from The Hague, said they were only mildly fazed by the rains. On Thursday night they fell off to sleep in their hotel room, listening to the thunderclaps, and, they said, they felt at home.</p>
