        <p>Edmund Morris, whose memoir of President Reagan's life threads fiction through fact, began a 14-city tour last night promoting a book that has provoked fascination and scorn.</p>
        <p>Mr. Morris opened his tour at the Barnes &amp; Noble bookstore on Broadway across from Lincoln Center, penetrating deep into overwhelmingly Democratic territory to talk about his unconventional manner of chronicling the life of a most Republican President.</p>
        <p>He was received warmly by a standing-room-only crowd of about  200 people, who listened intently as he shared anecdotes about ''a consummate actor'' who was a master at using ''charm to garner power.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Morris, a member of Random House's stable of accomplished writers, received a Pulitzer Prize in 1980 for his biography of Theodore Roosevelt. Handpicked by Mr. Reagan's staff, he was granted enviable access in the hope that he would produce the definitive text on an often opaque man.</p>
        <p>Definitive or no, the text he produced has seeded a news media storm.</p>
        <p>The book, ''Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan,'' went on sale last week. It includes a fictional character, modeled loosely after Mr. Morris himself, who encounters Mr. Reagan repeatedly through life. In one section, this character edits Mr. Reagan's prose for the sports pages of a college newspaper; in another, he reports to a young Lieutenant Reagan while serving in the Army Air Force; in the end, he leads the ailing former President back to his place of birth.</p>
        <p>By imposing an imaginary character on a work of nonfiction, the  biography of a President no less, Mr. Morris has raised questions about what readers can trust in his work, about Random House's commitment to longstanding standards, and about the hazy lines at which celebrity legend meets historical fact.</p>
        <p>Mr. Morris offered a polished defense of his methods last night. He said: ''All I ask of the readers of this book is that you accept, in the early chapters, the presence of a spectator. Maybe a better word would be a projector.</p>
        <p>''My projector projects a documentary which is absolutely true to historical fact.''</p>
        <p>Random House, which advanced Mr. Morris $3 million, is clearly anticipating brisk sales. It augmented the initial press run of 300,000 with another 75,000 copies before the first copy of ''Dutch'' was sold.</p>
        <p>The publishing giant is also standing behind Mr. Morris's work. Its corporate Web site describes the author's fictions as ''a unique literary method'' in which Mr. Morris's ''biographical mind becomes in effect another character in the narrative.''</p>
        <p>Independent reviews have ranged from praise to contempt, although the negative reactions  stand out for the sharpness of their disgust.</p>
        <p>Michiko Kakutani wrote in The New York Times that Mr. Morris had squandered priceless access to a sitting President, and written not a biography but a ''cloying, egocentric novel.'' Writing in The Wall Street Journal, Peggy Noonan, a former Reagan speechwriter, described ''Dutch'' as a ''belly-flop into the pools of Narcissus.''</p>
        <p>Tom Perry, a spokesman for Random House, said criticism had split between ''book people,'' who  had reviewed ''Dutch'' warmly, and historians and journalists troubled by the book's fictions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perry brushed aside suggestions of an erosion in Random House's standards. ''I think that's just absurd,'' he said. ''The book is just too good.''</p>
        <p>Last night, Mr. Morris took his case directly to potential readers.</p>
        <p>The customers seemed compelled to attend last night, if only because of an enduring curiosity over Mr. Reagan's idiosyncratic Presidency.</p>
        <p>Mr. Morris satisfied their inquisitiveness, describing a President who occasionally displayed ''astonishing ignorance.''</p>
        <p>''He was convinced that trees caused acid rain, threatening the entire industrial Northeast,'' he said, to chuckles.</p>
        <p>Only one member of the audience questioned Mr. Morris on his biographical methods. ''Do you really think it would have weakened the book'' not to have a fictional narrator, asked Fred Rosenbaum, 52, of Morningside Heights in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''I don't know,'' Mr. Morris answered, but said that ''Reagan's past sprang to life'' once he had created the narrator.</p>
        <p>Mr. Morris's tour continues during the next five weeks with signings in San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, Chicago and elsewhere. He returns to New York for an Oct. 23 signing at the the Henry Luce Foundation in Manhattan, and finishes the tour on Nov. 14 at Bookends in Ridgewood, N.J. Walter Gilligan, Bookends' store manager, said yesterday that ever since Mr. Morris was criticized, sales have been hot.</p>
        <p>''People love an underdog,'' Mr. Gilligan said. ''Friday, Saturday  and Sunday, we sold the heck out of the book. The book was blah until then.''</p>
