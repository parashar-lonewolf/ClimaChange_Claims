        <p>After vowing for weeks to block spending provisions it said would be bad for the environment, the Clinton Administration won many concessions in the final budget agreement but gave ground on other disputed policies.</p>
        <p>In the end, the environmental deals were sweetened with money for both sides. The White House said it had won an additional  $476 million for favored programs involving climate change, water quality and conservation lands. At the same time, Republican lawmakers won provisions to spend millions more on items including logging and transportation projects in Alaska.</p>
        <p>The grueling negotiations were a classic exercise in compromise, and a few main issues remained in dispute after negotiators declared late on Wednesday that they had outlined a deal.</p>
        <p>In two provisions settled today, Congressional Republicans would block new oil royalty rules that would require big oil companies to pay $64 million a year more for oil from public lands. And Congressional negotiators pushed through a proposal by industry, environmentalists and local government in Quincy, Calif., that would increase logging in national forests in the Sierra Nevada. Both proposals had been opposed by Senator Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat who is in a tough re-election race.</p>
        <p>The White House declared victory on the environmental issues, with President Clinton saying, ''We honored our obligations to the next generation by strongly protecting the environment.''</p>
        <p>But Gene Karpinski, the head of U.S. PIRG, the Washington lobbying office for state Public Interest Research Groups, said: ''This bill deserves to be vetoed, not celebrated. It contains far too many unacceptable anti-environmental provisions that will weaken public health provisions and plunder public resources.''</p>
        <p>The Administration accepted a one-year delay in new regulations governing mining on public land, the second such delay. It accepted a provision to make it easier for ranchers to renew grazing permits on public lands without comprehensive environmental reviews. And it accepted a delay in the schedule for phasing out methyl bromide, a farm pesticide that damages the atmosphere's protective ozone layer.</p>
        <p>But Congress removed proposals that would have required an 18 percent increase in timber harvests on national forests, required the Forest Service to cut down trees before setting fires to clear underbrush, delayed revisions to forest management plans and put off work to remove logging roads from forests.</p>
        <p>After intense negotiations with the powerful Alaskan delegation, the Forest Service agreed to increase by $12.5 million its spending on timber sales in the Tongass National Forest in Alaska, increasing the supply of timber 25 percent above targets and encouraging the Louisiana Pacific Corporation to build a mill in the region. In exchange, the Alaskans dropped other provisions that would have increased logging even more.</p>
        <p>The Administration also agreed to spend $37.5 million on a medical clinic, airport improvements and a possible road and ferry system to help residents of the remote fishing village of King Cove, Alaska. In exchange, the Alaskans dropped their plan to build a road to the town on a route that would have crossed a wilderness area of the Izembek Wildlife Refuge.</p>
        <p>Congress agreed to increase spending on the President's clean water proposals, including controls on polluted runoff from farms, to $1.7 billion, $150 million more than Congress had proposed.</p>
        <p>Spending from the Federal trust fund that pays for land acquisition would increase to $325 million, $55 million more than last year.</p>
        <p>And spending for energy related research programs intended to stave off global warming by reducing emissions of heat-trapping gases from burning carbon fuels would total slightly more than $1 billion, $120 million more than Congress had proposed but less than the Administration's request for $1.3 billion.</p>
        <p>Disputes over the management of salmon in the rivers of the Pacific Northwest were resolved mainly in the Administration's favor.</p>
