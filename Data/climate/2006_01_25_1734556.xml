        <p>Has Canada turned upside down in electing Stephen Harper as the next prime minister? Are conservative winds suddenly blowing through cities where gays and lesbians legally marry and the government pays everyone's health bills?</p>
        <p>The next leader of Canada expresses skepticism about the Kyoto climate change protocol, opposes same-sex marriage and wants to make the Canadian military muscular again. He openly supported the American-led invasion of Iraq. All are positions that put Mr. Harper, 46, well to the right on the Canadian political spectrum.</p>
        <p>By electing this free-market economist from Alberta, a conservative oil-producing province frequently likened to Texas, it may seem that the Canadian people were trying to debunk the prevailing political wisdom of recent years that their progressive-minded nation was drawing further and further away from the United States.</p>
        <p>But many analysts and political observers here caution that it is too soon to draw too stark a conclusion from the election on Monday, in which Mr. Harper's party won a mere 36.3 percent of the popular vote. The shift in Canadian politics is likely to be far from seismic.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harper ran a tightly orchestrated campaign focused pragmatically on the pocketbook, shirking ideology and hot-button social issues. He promised allowances to families with young children to help them pay for child care. He pledged modest cuts to the unpopular national sales tax and promised tax breaks for people using public transit. He did not make bold proposals for reforming the national health insurance system, and he made it clear that despite his support for the war in Iraq, he would not send troops there.</p>
        <p>The election outcome, in fact, can be read as more of a rejection of Prime Minister Paul Martin's scandal-racked Liberal Party than an embrace of Mr. Harper's own modest agenda.</p>
        <p>''It's a very slim mandate, and the party that is holding power is holding it by a thread,'' said Pierre Martin, a political scientist at the University of Montreal. ''If you have a party system divided into four, one party can take power with a proportion of the vote in the 30's percent range. That doesn't mean the country is moving right.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, when the victorious Mr. Harper stepped to the platform early Tuesday morning before his adoring campaign supporters, he was careful not to suggest that he planned anything more than careful change.</p>
        <p>Implicitly acknowledging that his backing was less than overwhelming, he noted that voters had ''asked us to cooperate, to work together and to get on with tackling the real issues that matter to ordinary working people and their families.''</p>
        <p>Arriving in Ottawa in the afternoon, he made the briefest, and vaguest, of statements at the airport. ''I know a lot of you are going to be with us now in the next few months and years ahead,'' he said, ''as we start rebuilding this great country of ours.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Harper's modest words in part reflect a man who is shy to the point of being aloof, someone who has always been careful not to show all of his cards. He is known to have a fiery temper, and he barely disguises his distrust for reporters. His sense of humor on the campaign trail was most revealing in its self-deprecating jokes about his lack of charisma.</p>
        <p>But the statements on Tuesday were also intended to balance two goals that will probably not always fit comfortably together.</p>
        <p>To enact legislation and even for his government to survive, Mr. Harper must build bridges to work with three left-leaning parties that together will hold the balance of power in the lower house of Parliament, where his Conservative Party won 124 seats of 308 on Monday.</p>
        <p>At the same time, he must offer hope to his western base that its patience during years in the political wilderness will eventually take it to a more conservative promised land.</p>
        <p>''The westerners will have to understand they will have to make compromises and move to the center,'' said Michel C. Auger, a political columnist at Le Journal de Montr√©al. ''But Harper can use the time to build a stronger power base in the Maritimes, Quebec and Ontario so next time he can build a majority government and put forward their agenda.''</p>
        <p>His own background already straddles that geographic and political divide. Born and raised in Toronto, he moved to Alberta to work in the oil and gas industry in his early 20's and began his conservative tilt as he studied economics at the University of Calgary. He met his wife, Laureen, at a Reform Party convention in 1991.</p>
        <p>In the 1990's he directed the National Citizens Coalition, a conservative advocacy group that favored free-market economics, privatizations and tax cuts, an agenda that does not necessarily resonate with most Canadians even today.</p>
        <p>The one area where Mr. Harper may be able to make a difference is foreign affairs, even though he admits to having little expertise there. He will surely improve the tone of relations with the Bush administration, which has been downright acrimonious since the Iraq invasion, which Ottawa opposed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harper could serve as a bridge between the United States and countries that have signed and ratified the Kyoto protocol to find ways to cooperate on controlling climate change. He could reopen the debate on whether Canada should join the Bush administration's missile defense system, which Mr. Martin rejected with little diplomatic finesse. But even those modest goals may not be easy.</p>
        <p>''It's a delicate balancing act,'' said James Blanchard, a former United States ambassador to Ottawa. ''I am sure that Stephen Harper wants good relations with President Bush and the United States, but any Canadian prime minister has to keep a noticeable independence from the United States, or he loses credibility in Canada.''</p>
