        <p>IN a sort of new renaissance, historic quilts -- documents of fabrics, designs and customs of the past -- have been adapted as a medium of contemporary design.</p>
        <p>''Pieces, Parts and Passion: The Quilted Medium,'' a traveling exhibition organized by the Lubbock Fine Arts Center in Texas and displayed at the Bruce Museum through April 26, heralds contemporary rather than traditional versions.</p>
        <p>''They look anything but like quilts,'' said Susan Kart, the museum's curatorial assistant and first intern in the museum's Lillian Butler Davey resident internship program. The exhibition is dedicated to Mrs. Davey, who founded the internship program before her recent death.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kart has a special affinity for the subject. ''I came from a family of craftswomen,'' she said. ''My grandmother, mother and aunt are all artistic. My grandmother is very crafty; anything she can do with her hands -- knitting, sewing, embroidery, quilting -- she's done it all. So it was fun to go from my family's traditional handwork to seeing these. The quilts use those same traditional methods but are very much contemporary works of art, not something to put on a bed.'' Ms. Kart emphasized, ''This is not a traditional quilt show!''</p>
        <p>The 19 invited artists (men as well as women) from the United States, Canada and Australia, have taken the orthodox technique and integrated it with innovative processes from photography to painting, stenciling, collaging and fabric sculpturing. ''So you have artists working like artists but within the quilt medium,'' Ms. Kart said.</p>
        <p>The quilts are deliberately hung in an arcade gallery that leads to a Surrealist exhibition. ''It provides a comparison between the surrealist movement of the 20's and 30's and the visual stimuli of today,'' Ms. Kart said, noting the presence of the Surrealist vocabulary in many artists' work today, even in quilts.</p>
        <p>They are grouped by color and by visual association. Some are abstract and others depict realistic images. An outrageous razzle-dazzle of color, obviously very tactile, they also make witty and timely statements.</p>
        <p>Some unveil environmental themes in brilliant, almost jarring  colors, some bear innovative outer shapes, round like the universe, or jagged representing acid rain.</p>
        <p>Humor is evident in Wendy Huhn's black and red ''Hot Flash,'' a checkerboard of a woman in the throes of menopause jumping out of hormone cream jars.</p>
        <p>Sue Alvarez's ''Landing Strip for Gay Martians'' also provokes a smile, its abstraction begging interpretation -- round shapes that could be spaceships, long strips of cloth, maybe runways. And all the bright colors of the rainbow, symbolic of gay and lesbian hope and solidarity for a brighter future.</p>
        <p>In ''Finding the Golden Edges,'' the artist Joan Schulze applied photosensitive emulsion to create a haunting border of eyes that look into the quilt, a kind of Pop Art sensation. ''For surrealists, the eyes were the subconscious into the soul or doorway into dreams,'' Ms. Kart noted.</p>
        <p>Then there's the only free-hanging quilt, suspended so both sides can be seen: Joan Lintault's ''Garden of Milk,'' an ethereal spider web that invites looking through. Leaves, butterflies, bumblebees and mushrooms  are stitched and quilted onto the filigreed background.</p>
        <p>A garden gate beckons, one side in black and white, the reverse tie-dyed warm color blocks of summer and fall -- iridescent netting upon which vines climb. Clearly it is not a bed covering.</p>
        <p>James Acord and Susan Shie describe their collaborative sculptural work, ''Night Chant -- A Green Quilt,'' in this way: ''Medicine animals, strange angels and interplanetary objects often float among the stream of consciousness written on our artwork. Very dimensional and embellished with beads, tooled leather, gemstones and glow-in-the-dark paint, our quilts are made to inform and heal, a mixture of poetry, diary, humor and prayer.''</p>
        <p>And Caryl Bryer Fallert's ''Reflection No. 28'' is like getting sucked into a hologram; slivers of fabric flit this way and that, so looking it at from each end, the color spectrum changes.</p>
        <p>''It goes from being flat to trompe l'oeil, swaying, almost breaking out, creating the illusion of depth and movement,'' Ms. Kart marveled. ''It looks dynamite in here. It fits the space, and like the surrealists is so witty and wacky.</p>
        <p>The Bruce Museum, 1 Museum Drive in Greenwich, is open Tuesday through Saturday 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. and Sunday 1 P.M. to 5 P.M.</p>
