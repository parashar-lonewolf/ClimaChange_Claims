        <p>George W. Bush was a man with a serious environmental problem throughout his campaign for the presidency. And shortly after he took office, environmental groups successfully managed to cast him as ''pro arsenic,'' for his administration's attempts to change water safety standards.</p>
        <p>Then came Sept. 11, after which the biggest environmental groups fell silent, fearful that attacking the president would make them appear unpatriotic.</p>
        <p>In response, the administration pressed ahead as quietly as possible -- largely through the regulatory process -- to allow road-building in national forests, reverse the phase-out of snowmobiles in national parks, make it easier for mining companies to dig for gold, copper and zinc on public lands, relax energy-efficiency standards for air conditioners, bar the reintroduction of grizzly bears in the Northwest and make it easier for developers to eliminate wetlands. Most recently, the administration approved the largest timber salvage operation in the nation's history in the Bitterroot National Forest, openly skirting the public appeals process, a move that has been halted by the courts.</p>
        <p>The administration also pushed for drilling for oil in a wildlife refuge in Alaska as an attempt to bolster national security. And the fog of war has obscured, too, the administration's policy on global warming. Last summer, after President Bush rejected the international Kyoto treaty on global warming, he pledged to start research programs to study climate shifts and find new technologies to cut emissions without harming the economy. But government scientists say that administration officials are now telling agencies not to expect additional money to pay for new efforts.</p>
        <p>Many of these actions would have received front-page coverage as part of the evolving ''pro-business'' tilt of the Bush White House.</p>
