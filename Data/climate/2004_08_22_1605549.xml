        <p>(Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>SNOW, by Orhan Pamuk. (Knopf, $26.) Ka, the blocked-poet hero of this notable Turkish writer's seventh novel, returns from self-exile in Germany to look into the deaths of some young girls who killed themselves after their schools forbade their headscarves. The line between farce and tragedy is drawn in blood where secular and Islamic Turkey seem to explode on contact; Ka falls foul of believers' charges of atheism, while the secular government cops fear his snooping.</p>
        <p>MONUMENTAL PROPAGANDA, by Vladimir Voinovich. (Knopf, $25.) A satirical but often touching Russian novel whose indomitable heroine, Aglaya Revkina, an ancient, irreformable Stalinist, loathes the wimps and consumers who wrecked Communism; she cherishes a discarded statue of Stalin in her apartment for 40 years.</p>
        <p>THE PERSISTENCE OF MEMORY, by Tony Eprile. (Norton, $24.95.) Part fable, part coming-of-age story, Eprile's first novel concerns Paul Sweetbread, a burdened, divided South African Jew with something of a crush on the great blond Afrikaner brutes who served with him in his country's endless, unforgettable ''Border War'' in Namibia and Angola.</p>
        <p>COCKTAILS, by D. A. Powell. (Graywolf, paper, $14.) Exceptional poems by a poet of extravagant imagination whose long, stuttering lines can render personal glosses to New Testament scenes or reflect his personal sexual history (the title puns on the medical treatments that keep his H.I.V. in check).</p>
        <p>JEROME ROBBINS: His Life, His Theater, His Dance, by Deborah Jowitt. (Simon &amp; Schuster, $40.) A grand survey of the great and deservedly popular choreographer of ballet and Broadway, as well as a personal examination of a radically unhappy man; at 57 he could call himself ''a Jewish ex-commie fag who had to go into a mental hospital.''</p>
        <p>A SEAHORSE YEAR, by Stacey D'Erasmo. (Houghton Mifflin, $24.) D'Erasmo's intelligent, intimate novel explores issues of art and sex in an anything-goes San Francisco and vicinity, where Christopher, a teenage boy whose biological parents are both gay, is threatened by mental illness. When he hits the road, his absence threatens the stability of the extended family he leaves behind.</p>
        <p>BOILING POINT: How Politicians, Big Oil and Coal, Journalists, and Activists Are Fueling the Climate Crisis -- and What We Can Do to Avert Disaster, by Ross Gelbspan. (Basic Books, $22.) Gelbspan, a reporter who learned to fear global warming while researching a previous book, indicts all parties (see the subtitle) in this one, where he joins muckraker predecessors in both exposing evils and proposing bold proceedings to eliminate them.</p>
        <p>PASTORELLES, by John Taggart. (Flood Editions, paper, $13.95.) A poet of understated, photographic accuracy pins his love of rural Pennsylvania, its stone walls and old beech trees, on lines whose flat repetitions suggest dryness and frustration; a style so unembellished permits him to undertake an irony-deprived high style when he chooses.</p>
