        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your support and discussion of the Environmental Protection Agency's radiation standard for the Yucca Mountain spent nuclear fuel repository in Nevada is a breath of fresh air in a highly politicized and often confused debate. One point missing, however, is that the original requirement for a 10,000-year isolation time is a result of the outdated policy decision, made during the Carter administration, to not recycle spent nuclear fuel.</p>
        <p>As two of my colleagues and I have pointed out in our article ''Smarter Use of Nuclear Waste'' in the December issue of Scientific American, if the spent fuel is recycled, the required isolation time for the true waste is reduced to less than 500 years. In addition, one is able to obtain more than 99 percent of the energy in the original uranium ore compared with less than 1 percent with the current wasteful once-through cycle.</p>

        <p>Modern recycling of spent nuclear fuel makes nuclear power sustainable and essentially inexhaustible, minimizes the risks of nuclear weapons proliferation and operates without contributing to climate change.</p>
