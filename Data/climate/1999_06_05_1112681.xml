        <p>AFRICA</p>
        <p>ALGERIA: REBEL AMNESTY ON THE WAY  President Abdelaziz Bouteflika will soon declare an amnesty for Muslim rebels and their supporters who renounce violence, Government and Islamist officials said. They said the amnesty would involve a formal Government endorsement of a cease-fire declared by the armed wing of the Islamic Salvation Front 20 months ago, a release of prisoners and reduced jail terms for Islamist activists.</p>

        <p>NIGERIA: DRIVE ON CORRUPTION  In his first speech to a joint session of the two houses of the new Parliament, President Olusegun Obasanjo promised to introduce an anti-corruption bill within two weeks and said a drive on graft would be central to his administration. An aide said Mr. Obasanjo would also set up a panel to investigate human rights abuses between 1994 and the end of military rule last month.</p>

        <p>NIGER: POWER-SHARING CHARTER  The people of Niger will be asked to vote on a draft constitution that would share power between a president and a prime minister. The text was adopted by a 41-to-38 vote among members of a committee set up by the junta that seized power after the April 9 assassination of President Ibrahim Bare Mainassara. A similar constitution was adopted in 1993, leading to a paralysis of government and a coup led by Mr. Mainassara.</p>

        <p>THE AMERICAS</p>
        <p>PERU: GUERRILLAS RENEW ATTACKS  In a sudden resurgence of activity, the Shining Path guerrillas have killed nine people in two separate ambushes in remote areas more than 200 miles apart, the police said. President Alberto Fujimori dismissed the recent attacks as the ''flailing arms of a drowning man,'' but they were the fourth in the past week, leaving a total of 18 people dead.</p>

        <p>COLOMBIA: BISHOP CALLED A THREAT  After a complaint by President Andres Pastrana that ''foreign members of the Catholic church'' have set up illegal ties with left-wing guerrillas, a German-born Roman Catholic bishop has been declared persona non grata. Msgr. Emilio Sthele was called ''a national security threat,'' apparently because of unauthorized involvement in talks aimed at releasing kidnapping victims of the National Liberation Army, the group that abducted more than 140 people from a church service in Cali last Sunday.</p>

        <p>CANADA: ONTARIO PREMIER RE-ELECTED  For the first time in 32 years, Ontario voters returned the governing party to office, handing Premier Mike Harris and his Progressive Conservatives a majority of parliamentary seats. After a divisive election and four years of deep cuts in social spending, Mr. Harris promised to start a process of reconciliation.</p>

        <p>MEXICO: SUMMIT MEETING  Six U.S. Cabinet secretaries and dozens of lower-ranking officials visited Mexico to take part in an annual meeting of top officials from the two nations. The American officials included Attorney General Janet Reno and the Secretaries of Commerce, Housing, Transportation and Interior, as well as the White House's drug policy adviser, Barry McCaffrey.</p>

        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>BRITAIN: PINOCHET HEARING SET  A London judge set Sept. 27 as the date for hearings to begin on the extradition to Spain of Gen. Augusto Pinochet to face charges of crimes against humanity. Graham Parkinson of Bow Street Magistrates Court gave prosecutors a deadline of Aug. 31 to submit any additional allegations against the 83-year-old former Chilean dictator. He has been in custody since his arrest in London on Oct. 16.</p>
        <p>Warren Hoge (NYT)</p>
        <p>SPAIN: BASQUE PEACE MOVES  The Government's chief spokesman said Madrid is willing to make contact with the Basque separatist group E.T.A. But he stopped short of confirming reports this week in two leading newspapers that the Government sent a letter in March reiterating its offer to talk with the rebels, who have observed a cease-fire since September.</p>
        <p>Al Goodman (NYT)</p>
        <p>RUSSIA: I.M.F. TAX BILL  The lower house of Parliament gave initial approval to one of several economic bills intended to help secure a new loan from the International Monetary Fund. The bill, which would put a tax on luxury cars, is expected to bring in more than $122 million. The I.M.F. wants Russia to make a number of changes before it will disburse a $4.5 billion loan.</p>

        <p>SWITZERLAND: CLIMATE WARNING  Aircraft emissions alter the atmosphere and contribute to climate change, a trend likely to accelerate as global air travel increases, according to a study by two scientific groups. As a result, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and a scientific panel on the ozone layer said, carbon dioxide emissions are projected to increase threefold by 2050.</p>

        <p>ASIA</p>
        <p>KASHMIR: INDIA'S ATTACKS CONTINUE  Indian air and ground offensives intensified against guerrillas in Kashmir. For the 10th straight day, Indian jets struck the mountain positions seized by the Islamic guerrillas, who India claims are backed by Pakistan in their incursion across the cease-fire line dividing Kashmir. Pakistan denies the accusations.</p>

        <p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
        <p>LEBANON: PREMIER VISITS JEZZIN  Salim Hoss became the first Lebanese Prime Minister in 17 years to visit Jezzin following a long-awaited withdrawal from the town by the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia. Mr. Hoss was welcomed by surprised residents, the first visit by a top Lebanese official since Israel invaded Lebanon in June 1982.</p>
        <p>(Agence France-Presse)</p>
        <p>IRAN: MODERATES UNDER ATTACK  Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, criticized officials who want to relax Islamic social and political restrictions. The criticism came after President Mohammad Khatami urged an audience of hundreds of thousands to tolerate differences. Both men spoke at the mausoleum of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, founder of Iran's Islamic revolution, on the 10th anniversary of his death.</p>
