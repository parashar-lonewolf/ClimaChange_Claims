        <p>Time won the top national magazine award last night, placing first in the general excellence category for magazines with a circulation of more than two million.</p>
        <p>The award is Time's first for general excellence since 1985.</p>
        <p>The weekly was honored for its coverage of Hurricane Katrina and its look inside the interrogation rooms at Guantánamo Bay, covering both with what the judges said was in-depth reporting, insightful analysis and striking photography. ''Time keeps reinvigorating its role as a newsweekly,'' the judges said.</p>
        <p>The magazine's Katrina coverage also won the award for a single-topic issue. The judges called it ''a triumph of the newsmagazine's craft.''</p>
        <p>The recognition comes as Time and other newsweeklies have been struggling to redefine their mission in the Internet age. Its parent, Time Inc., has been trimming the staff, focusing on its Web site, and is preparing to remove its managing editor, Jim Kelly, who accepted the general excellence award to a standing ovation and vigorous applause.</p>
        <p>Other winners of the general excellence awards for their category of circulation were ESPN The Magazine, Esquire, New York magazine, Harper's Magazine and The Virginia Quarterly Review.</p>
        <p>Adam Moss, the editor of New York, slapped his forehead in surprise. ''This means more than it probably should,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For general excellence online, the award went to The National Geographic Online, cited for its ''stunning photography, innovative interactive applications of text and video, and first-class journalism.''</p>
        <p>The magazine awards, the industry's most prestigious honor, are sponsored by the American Society of Magazine Editors in association with the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. In the past, they have been presented at a lunch at the Waldorf-Astoria. But this year, in an effort to draw more publicity to the magazine industry, the awards were presented on a broad stage at the home of Jazz at Lincoln Center in between cocktail receptions.</p>
        <p>The event, which many call the Oscars of the magazine industry, also featured celebrities, including Anderson Cooper, the CNN anchor, and Meg Ryan, the actress. More than 1,000 magazine editors, writers and designers attended, with a lounge-act combo playing onstage as winners accepted their awards.</p>
        <p>One surprise was that The Atlantic Monthly, which was nominated in eight categories, was shut out.</p>
        <p>The public interest award went to Elizabeth Kolbert of The New Yorker for her series on global warming, which the judges cited for ''the clarity and synthesis that only a gifted writer can summon.''</p>
        <p>The New Yorker, which in recent years has walked away with a chestful of trophies, was nominated in five categories and won in two: in addition to public interest, it won for commentary, for Hendrik Hertzberg's ''Talk of the Town'' columns.</p>
        <p>The New Yorker has won 46 of the awards, the most of any magazine in the competition's 40-year history.</p>
        <p>The reporting award was given to Rolling Stone, for an article by James Bamford about the rumors, imagery and information that were used to sell the Iraq war.</p>
        <p>There were several unusual citations this year. In feature writing, one of the most prized categories for magazines, The American Scholar won for a piece by Priscilla Long about the human genome.</p>
        <p>Vanity Fair won in the essays category for articles published posthumously by Marjorie Williams, who chronicled her struggle with liver cancer.</p>
        <p>And The Virginia Quarterly Review, in addition to its general excellence award, won the prize for fiction for stories by Joyce Carol Oates, R. T. Smith and Alan Heathcock.</p>
        <p>Self was cited for personal service, for a handbook about breast cancer, and Golf Magazine won in the leisure interest category for ''The New Way to Putt,'' described as ''a breakthrough technique for getting the ball in the hole.''</p>
        <p>In profile writing, Esquire won for an article by Robert Kurson about a man who had been blind since childhood and became a Central Intelligence Agency analyst and skydiver, then received a stem cell and cornea transplant and regained his sight.</p>
        <p>Backpacker magazine was cited for its Basecamp section, which the judges said neatly stuffed exactly what readers needed to know ''without an extra ounce of verbiage.''</p>
        <p>Harper's won for reviews and criticism by Wyatt Mason.</p>
        <p>In addition to its general excellence award, New York magazine won the design award. W won the photography award for work the judges said ''shatters the conventional boundaries of fashion imagery.'' Rolling Stone won the photo essay award for ''The Edge of the World,'' by Sebastião Salgado about Antarctica and Patagonia.</p>
