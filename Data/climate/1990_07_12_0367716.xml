        <p>LEAD: After blocking new worldwide environmental initiatives at the economic summit meeting here, President Bush attacked domestic critics of his stand today, insisting that he had defended American jobs from the assault of a radical fringe.</p>
        <p>After blocking new worldwide environmental initiatives at the economic summit meeting here, President Bush attacked domestic critics of his stand today, insisting that he had defended American jobs from the assault of a radical fringe.</p>
        <p>The leaders of the world's seven richest nations declined to adopt a West German proposal to set limits on the emissions of gases that contribute to global warming. Instead, they opted for an experimental program involving a single nation, Brazil.</p>
        <p>In the only new environmental initiative in the final communique issued at the summit meeting today, the leaders adopted another German proposal to preserve tropical rain forests. They proposed that the World Bank develop a pilot program for Brazil to ease the financial burdens of restraining development activity there that has destroyed vast sections of rain forest.</p>
        <p>Compromise Is Acknowledged</p>
        <p>West Germany's Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, acknowledged today that the summit leaders had compromised by turning away from his proposals on global warming because ''the situation is different in the United States.''</p>
        <p>President Bush said at a news conference this afternoon, ''I think we came out with a reasoned position, not a radical position that's going to throw a lot of American men and women out of jobs.''</p>
        <p>During the meetings here President Bush has come under fire from environmental groups who came to Houston to lobby for forceful action. Today, the President answered back in a rare display of public anger.</p>
        <p>He said: ''We cannot govern by listening to the loudest voice on the extreme of an environmental movement. And I did not rely heavily on them for support in getting elected President of the United States. And I'm not going to be persuaded that I can get some brownie points by appealing to one of these groups or another.''</p>
        <p>Monitoring Coalition</p>
        <p>Some 150 environmental organizations from the seven summit nations formed a coalition called ''Envirosummit'' to monitor their governments' actions here. On Sunday, the environmentalists released what they called a ''scorecard'' on each of the seven nations criticizing their failure to fulfill promises made at last year's summit meeting in Paris.</p>
        <p>Assessing American actions in the past year, Jay Hair, president of the National Wildlife Federation, said, ''Bush's efforts at balance, compromise and consensus building are killing our world.''</p>
        <p>Today, President Bush lashed back at the environmental groups, saying, ''They haven't seemed happy with me for a long time. And I'm not too happy with them. I think their grading system is absolutely essentially absurd.''</p>
        <p>The environmental coalition issued a statement today concluding that the summit leaders had failed because, ''they abandoned their Paris promises to work together to solve the world's most pressing environmental problems.''</p>
        <p>Having campaigned for office on promises to be ''the environment President,'' President Bush declared that last year's Paris meeting ''marked a watershed'' because of its environmental resolutions.</p>
        <p>The Paris meeting was the first economic summit meeting to address environmental issues seriously, and its final communique listed a series of initiatives, including an endorsement of common efforts to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other ''greenhouse gases'' that are said to contribute to a warming of the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Most Divisive Item</p>
        <p>But at this year's summit meeting, environmental issues proved to be one of the most divisive items on the agenda. Chancellor Kohl said the subject produced ''rather passionate discussions,'' and President Bush described the West German leader as ''a bulldog when it comes to the environment.''</p>
        <p>In advance of the Houston meeting, Chancellor Kohl sent his summit colleagues a letter encouraging them to consider a number of proposals that would build on the Paris promises, including a commitment to accept strict limits on greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
        <p>All of the summit nations except the United States have already accepted such limits to some extent. The White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu, has led the Bush Administration's opposition to such limits, arguing that scientific data on the subject are inconclusive.</p>
        <p>But today's communique included an apparent rebuff of Mr. Sununu. It stated, ''We agree that in the face of threats of irreversible environmental damage, lack of full scientific certainty is no excuse to postpone actions which are justified in their own right.''  THE HOUSTON SUMMIT</p>
