        <p>Double Fold</p>
        <p>Libraries and the Assault on Paper.</p>
        <p>By Nicholson Baker.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 370 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Random House. $25.95.</p>
        <p>It took me days to read all of Nicholson Baker's ''Double Fold,'' not because it's a slog -- far from it -- but because it got me, as he intended, hopping mad. Get through a few paragraphs, up out of the chair, go do something for a few hours, then back at it. I felt like thrusting it under every sentient nose I could find; but I'd repeatedly scrawled ''Whew!,'' ''Yikes!'' and ''Jesus!'' in the margins, sometimes two and three times a page, and one hates to look crazed. But Baker, bless his obsessive-compulsive heart, doesn't seem to mind: one of his sliest strategies always has been to present himself as a hand-wringing head case with an off-the-charts I.Q. In ''Double Fold,'' glimpses of his old nerd-in-overdrive persona (''I began moaning and typing things like 'Oh, my friends, it's worse than you think' '') make his indignation the more thunderous by contrast. If there's justice in the world, he'll rattle some cages. I know: big if.</p>
        <p>When Baker first began what looked like a second career as a ''library activist'' -- a 1994 New Yorker piece about the iniquity of dumping card catalogs, a 1996 speech in the San Francisco Public Library's auditorium, after that institution had sent books to a landfill because there wasn't room to store them -- I thought it was a noble, quixotic and essentially bum idea, like Rimbaud taking up gunrunning. Here was America's most radically original fiction writer since -- who? Donald Barthelme? -- devoting his time to work that any good investigative journalist could've done. And now a whole book about libraries' ''assault on paper'' in favor of microfilm and digital scanning? Was it worth agonizing over the ''disbinding'' -- i.e., guillotining along their spines -- and discarding of books nobody's checked out in decades? The pulping of old newspapers that if you lived 1,000 years you might leaf through on a slow afternoon when you were 910? Barbaric, sure. Nuts, for reasons we'll get to. But it's not global warming, world hunger or a Republican coup d'Ã©tat. Baker has even started a nonprofit foundation that rents a warehouse in New Hampshire, sheltering several thousand volumes of old newspapers, at a cost of $26,000 a year. Well, I thought, if that's how he wants to distract himself from his true calling, fine. We all have our little ways.</p>
        <p>But for Baker, it's all the same calling. What makes him such a magical novelist is the same impulse that makes him feel, ''turning the pages of a beautiful Chicago Tribune volume from 1909, as if I'd stumbled on a lost, jewel-encrusted city in the jungle.'' Baker writes fiction much the way he does guerrilla librarianship: trying to cram into it, for safekeeping, everything he ever saw, heard, thought and read. Like Proust, Nabokov and any other thinking person who's racking up highway miles on the way to the grave, Baker's fixated on the subject of time: how much life a single instant contains, how many instants there are, how instantly they pass away forever.</p>
        <p>In his first novel, ''The Mezzanine'' (1988), he chronicled an office worker's expedition to buy shoelaces, with digressive footnotes about ice-cube trays, Jiffy Pop and the distinction between ''oop'' and ''oops'' -- all in the course of a lunch hour. In his craziest and best book, ''The Fermata'' (1994), an office temp (a temp: got it) can stop time and, in a quiescently frozen world, undress literally statuesque women and manhandle himself, without a second having elapsed. And he's said that in his most recent novel, ''The Everlasting Story of Nory'' (1998), he was trying to preserve (everlasting: got it) the 9-year-oldness of his real-life daughter -- who must now be 12 or 13 and counting.</p>
        <p>So when Baker devotes a page to detailing part of what he read in a 1934 volume of The New York World-Telegram, apparently discarded by the Library of Congress, it's not whimsy or nostalgia, not even gee-whizziness at stumbling over pieces by A. J. Liebling (on a violent taxi strike) and Joseph Mitchell (on Emma Goldman's return from exile): it's an incantation to bring back the dead. ''Reading a paper like this is not the only way to understand the lost past life of a city,'' he writes, ''but no other way will enclose you so completely within one time-stratum's universe of miscellaneous possibility.'' That last phrase pretty well characterizes Baker's whole literary enterprise. No wonder he's taking this so personally: the ''assault on paper'' is an assault on his sensibility.</p>
        <p>Baker's no lead-pencil Luddite: he's got no problem with searchable digitexts or legible photocopies, as long as we hang on to the real books, magazines and newspapers, which in most cases remain indefinitely usable. And he demolishes the arguments against doing so: that libraries are running out of space, and that paper, because of its acid content, is rapidly turning to dust.</p>
        <p>The first is easy: what the Library of Congress spends in a year on microfilming would buy a storage facility ''the size of a Home Depot, which would hold a century of newsprint. . . . Why is it so difficult for this great research institution to do what . . . a successful pet-food discounter . . . manages to do year after year, without fuss?'' It's the ''turning to dust'' myth that puts Baker on his mettle. Librarians, he says, ''have lied to us shamelessly about the extent of paper's fragility, and they continue to lie about it.'' Their test to determine a book's ''brittleness,'' and, hence, its discardability, gives him his title. In the ''double-fold'' test, you simply dogear a page and fold it back and forth to see if it breaks off. Different libraries use different standards: two double folds and ''a very gentle tug'' doom a book at the University of Maryland; at the more humid University of Florida, a book is brittle if it can't stand up to five.</p>
        <p>Baker dismisses this sedulous insanity with what family newspapers call a barnyard epithet. He ran a more sensible test on an 1893 book by Edmund Gosse: a corner of a page broke off even before he could finish the first single fold, yet he was able to turn that same page -- as readers do in the real world -- 800 times with zero damage. ''This was the sort of book,'' he writes, ''over which preservation people shake their heads and say, 'We've got just one chance to turn these pages, and it better be when they're under the camera.' '' But there's a less invasive test: simply check the prices these supposedly worthless books can fetch. The Library of Congress guillotined, filmed and pulped one 1909 illustrated book, the explorer Fanny Workman's ''Peaks and Glaciers of Nun Kun''; Baker recently turned up two copies on Bibliofind for sale at over $2,000 apiece. He estimates that the library threw out more than $10 million worth of ''public property'' between 1968 and 1984.</p>
        <p>Microfilm is pricey -- it costs at least 20 times more to film a book than to store it almost indefinitely -- a big drag to use and tends to fade and develop spots, blemishes and fungal infections. ''A sizable portion of the preservation budget in some large institutions,'' he writes, ''now must go toward the reduplication, with an attendant loss of detail, of old micro-negatives or positive prints onto fresh polyester.'' And digital scanning and storage will very likely cost even more. Simply substituting databases for card catalogs, Baker says, ''has very nearly blown the head gaskets of many libraries,'' and he claims decent digital copies of the books themselves could increase those costs 5,000 times. Really? Maybe. ''These figures are very loose and undoubtedly wrong,'' he admits, ''but the truth is that nobody has ever underestimated the cost of any computer project, and the costs will be yodelingly high in any case.'' And what institutions get for their money sometimes looks like this passage, from the Cornell library's digital version of an 1883 magazine article about an earthquake in Java: ''It xviii be unnecessamy for us to enter into further details of time catastrophic, save to remark that all we mepouted of time changes in time configumation of time hind lmadi time suiruounding ocemun bottom, has beemi comifimmed, amid much mom-c extensive changes noticed.''</p>
        <p>So if it's wacky to destroy usable paper in favor of iffy technologies, why is it happening? Baker traces the microfilm craze back to ''the cold war mania for micropreservation. . . . There was a palpable glamour to microfilming in those early days . . . a hot chemical whiff of cinematography and of high-stakes intelligence work.'' And like a gumshoe reporter, he follows the money. The micropreservationists may be trashing -- literally -- the heritage they're pledged to protect, but they sure can fund-raise. Their visions of paper self-destructing like the tape on the old ''Mission: Impossible'' series scared Congress into tripling the budget for the National Endowment for the Humanities' Division of Preservation and Access. The most effective sales tool was a documentary film about deteriorating books called ''Slow Fires,'' narrated by the august-sounding Robert MacNeil and financed by the N.E.H., the Exxon and Mellon Foundations and the Library of Congress. Baker calls it ''the most successful piece of library propaganda ever created''; one of his informants, a former Library of Congress book conservator named Peter Waters, calls it ''that ridiculous movie.'' As Baker describes it, the maddest moment comes when a deputy Librarian of Congress rips a page out of an old book, crumples it to confetti and says, ''You see what happens when you do that to it.''</p>
        <p>Baker never lets the techno-smoothies sell him. When he asks one preservationist how many books survive microfilming, she tells him, ''It would be a really difficult figure to keep track of. There are so many variables that go into returning items to the shelf.'' He's having none of it: ''Oh, piffle. It would be no more difficult to track this figure than to track any other.'' In his interview with the N.E.H. preservationist Patricia Battin, he forces her to eat -- however daintily -- her repeated public assertions that old books are ''turning to dust.'' ''Basically what we meant was they were crumbling,'' she tells him. ''I think we used 'crumbling.' 'Crumbling books' was what I remember much more that we used rather than 'turning to dust'. . . . You probably are quite right that 'turning to dust' may well be hyperbole.' '' One New York State librarian admits it is ''unfortunate'' when originals are discarded and microfilm goes bad, but asks, with every appearance of beleaguered reason, ''What's the other option, we don't try? That's obviously not the way to go.'' Baker's comment: ''But that is the way to go. When trying does far more harm than not trying, don't try. Go slow. Keep what you have.''</p>
        <p>''Double Fold'' will hack off Lynne Cheney, William Bennett, Vartan Gregorian, Daniel Boorstin and Bill Clinton -- all of whom have bought the microfilm mandarins' claims that we're looking at an imminent ''apocalypse of paper'' -- as well as the biblio-techies themselves. So that's another thing to like about this book. At first I thought Baker's little ad hominem zingers might hurt his cause with sobersided readers: that Boorstin is ''a chronic bow-tie-wearer'' is surely something that needed to be said, but was this the proper forum? Is it strictly relevant that the Library of Congress guy in ''Slow Fires'' reminds Baker of Frank Gorshin as the Riddler?</p>
        <p>Now, though, I just think what the hey. If Baker's spitting into the wind anyhow, he might as well have a little fun. And if he manages to win this one -- he still might as well have a little fun.</p>
        <p>A gloomier soul would never have taken on this cause in the first place: when the ice caps melt, will we care that we don't have a complete run of The Brooklyn Eagle on the raft? But Baker's anything but a quietist, and his book wouldn't let me rest easily either until I'd gotten off my duff and done something. So when I'd finished writing all but the last three sentences of this, I called his publisher to see if there was someplace you could send a check. They said the question hadn't come up. It will.</p>
