        <p>If too few people, as has been noted, do anything about the weather, surely the number who dance about it isn't much better. But few topics are more pressing of late, from the chronic debate over climate change to the acute crises surrounding Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath. Even so, the choreographer Brenda Way had her doubts when the composer Jack Perla suggested a piece about global warming. ''I couldn't see a place for this in a dance,'' Ms. Way, the artistic director of ODC/San Francisco, remembers thinking. Then one evening she had a eureka moment: a block of ice suspended onstage, melting ominously above oblivious dancers. ''That was sort of interesting to me,'' she said. The darkly humorous ''On a Train Heading South,'' which has its New York premiere on Tuesday night at the Joyce Theater, uses not one but 12 blocks of ice.</p>
        <p>Ms. Way is an astute observer of the way we live our trivia-filled lives. With the 2000 ''Crash'' she took on the excesses of life in Silicon Valley; in ''Spectral Evidence,'' 2001, male voyeurism. Her dance company, which currently comprises 11 dancers, has been a mainstay of San Francisco dance ever since she and her co-directors, Kimi Okada and KT Nelson, rode into town in a rickety school bus some 30 years ago. Ms. Nelson's edgy ''RingRoundRozi'' and Ms. Way's loose-limbed ''24 Exposures'' complete the Joyce program.</p>

        <p>To avoid thinking in environmental clich√©s, Ms. Way said she and her dancers developed an arsenal of what she calls ''weapons of mass distraction'': head butting, for example, or men streaking by in bridal veils.</p>
        <p>And where do you get 300 pounds of ice? From the Diamond Ice Cube Company, which will deliver 12 blocks of ice, 25 pounds each, by hand truck for each performance at the Joyce.</p>
