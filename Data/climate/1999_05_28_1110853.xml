        <p>The first global three-dimensional map of Mars, made with data from an orbiting American spacecraft, reveals a surface of extreme highs and lows sculptured by still mysterious processes, scientists said today.</p>
        <p>The high-resolution map shows a panorama of highlands and basins that include some of the most extreme features of the solar system known so far, including the tallest volcano and one of the largest impact craters.</p>
        <p>Mars is slightly pear-shaped, with a bulging, mountainous southern hemisphere that is, on average, three miles higher than its northern counterpart, scientists said. And a long-known southern depression, the Hellas basin, is actually the remnant of a giant asteroid impact, perhaps the deepest on any planet, they added.</p>
        <p>Dr. David E. Smith of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, lead author of a paper detailing the results in the journal Science, said new measurements revealed that the Hellas basin -- 6 miles deep and 1,300 miles across -- was gouged out by an impact early in Mars's four billion years.</p>
        <p>If the United States had been hit by an identical body, Dr. Smith told a NASA news conference today, the crater would stretch from the East Coast to the Rocky Mountains. And rock and debris blasted from the crater would be enough to cover the United States in a blanket up to two miles thick, he said.</p>
        <p>The new map was generated with readings from an instrument aboard NASA's Mars Global Surveyor, which reached Mars in 1997 and began its science mission a year ago. The instrument, the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter, fires infrared laser light pulses at the surface and determines land elevations by measuring the round-trip time of the light.</p>
        <p>Using 27 million measurements gathered in March and April of this year and last summer, scientists constructed the revealing map.</p>
        <p>Dr. Carl Pilcher, NASA's science director for solar system exploration, said, ''This data will serve as a basic reference book for Mars scientists for many years and should inspire a variety of new insights about the planet's geologic history.''</p>
        <p>The spacecraft continues to collect about 900,000 elevation measurements a day and that data will be used to compile an increasingly detailed map over the next two years, equal to one Martian year. An evolving map will be used to study Mars's  evolution and the processes that shaped its surface, scientists said, and also to help select landing sites for future spacecraft missions. Researchers are already using this information to assess an area near the south pole where NASA's Mars Polar Lander mission is scheduled to set down on Dec. 3.</p>
        <p>Dr. Maria T. Zuber, a professor of planetary sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and researcher on the project, said the dramatic slope from the south to north pole was a major finding relating to past water flow on the planet.</p>
        <p>''It's all downhill from the south pole to the north pole,'' Dr. Zuber said at the briefing, and knowing Martian elevations helps track the paths of ancient water flows. In the northern hemisphere, there is a huge basin that slopes down to about six miles below the average elevation of Mars, she said, and this feature ''is consistent with the formation of a past ocean.''</p>
        <p>However, she said, it remains to be proved if Mars ever had enough water to fill such a basin. While the area is smooth and featureless, as if once occupied by a sea, she said scientists had yet to detect any ''beach features'' indicating the edges of an ocean around the basin.</p>
        <p>''The north basin is the smoothest surface known in the solar system,'' Dr. Zuber said, but it could have been formed by volcanic upswellings instead of the presence of water.</p>
        <p>Dr. Zuber said the Tharsis region, a bulging plateau topped by volcanoes that straddle the equator, appeared to be composed of two raised volcanic domes instead of one. The new map also shows that the Olympus Mons volcano, which rises nearly 17 miles high, is a separate feature that is not part of the nearby Tharsis rise, as scientists had believed.</p>
        <p>The new map also shows that Mars's south pole is structured very much like the northern one. Dr. Zuber said this indicated there was more water ice than previously believed at the south pole, which also has a concentration of carbon dioxide ice. The deposits of water at the two poles could equal about 1.5 times the water frozen in the glaciers of Greenland, she estimated.</p>
