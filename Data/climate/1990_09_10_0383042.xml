        <p>LEAD: It used to be that the fight against acid rain united New York and other Northeastern states like allies in wartime. Together they railed against dirty Midwestern power plants, filed lawsuits against the Federal Government and mourned the fate of their slowly dying lakes.</p>
        <p>'Have to Practice What We Preach'</p>
        <p>But officials in neighboring states disagree, and are accusing New York of exporting its air pollution in much the same manner as the Midwestern states they have all condemned.</p>
        <p>''We in the Northeast have to practice what we preach,'' Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin of Vermont said. ''This is not the right time to launch a project that's going to hurt our environment.''</p>
        <p>The plant, proposed by a company called Inter-Power of New York, Inc. has become a campaign issue in Massachusetts, where all five candidates in this month's gubernatorial primary have come out against it. In the Berkshire region, where the impact of the plant would be the greatest, opposition to Inter-Power has become practically a prerequisite for running for office.</p>
        <p>In New York, too, the plant has been protested by dozens of politicians and civic groups, including, in a surprising twist, the local industrial development agency.</p>
        <p>But Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has remained silent, saying the matter is best left to state regulators to decide. Through a spokesman, Mr. Cuomo has said that he was sure that the regulators would be ''scrupulous'' in insuring that the plant qualified as ''clean technology.''</p>
        <p>The far-flung opposition to the plant has become a potential embarrassment to Mr. Cuomo, whose re-election campaign stresses his commitment to a clean environment. Critics of the plant charge that the Governor, so forceful when it comes to Midwestern polluters, has failed to show the same firmness closer to home. Reject or Embrace Coal?  ''You can't set a dual standard: one for the rest of the world and one for your state,'' said Ken Dufty, president of the Concerned Citizens for the Environment, a New York-based group formed to fight Inter-Power. ''I think the Governor needs to be made accountable for that.''</p>
        <p>The winds that blow pollution from the coal-fired power plants of the Midwest toward the Northeast would also scatter Inter-Power's emissions over a broad swath of the area, and the issues that the proposed plant raises are the same ones that have long troubled relations between the regions.</p>
        <p>Should the nation turn away from coal, as many Northeast officials have argued, because it produces large quantities of pollutants like sulfur dioxide, which are the precursors of acid rain? Or is coal, one of the nation's most abundant energy sources, an integral part of the country's future, as officials in the Midwest - and now in New York - have said?</p>
        <p>The disputed 220-megawatt power plant is proposed for a desolate industrial stretch of the Hudson River's west bank, beside a General Electric Company plant that has been fined for spilling solvents and other toxins into the river. The plant would sell some power to General Electric, and, under Federal law, the local utility company, Niagara Mohawk, would have to buy the rest. While the plant is of moderate size for a power station, it is unusually large for a co-generating plant.</p>
        <p>Whether the plant is needed is a matter of contention. Niagara Mohawk executives have testified that the company will not need new power until 1999, and plant opponents argue that conservation and other forms of power could easily meet the utility's needs by then.</p>
        <p>But state officials argue that the power is needed sooner, and the plant has received favorable reviews from state agencies including the Department of Environmental Conservation. The final say rests with the state's Board on Electric Generation Siting and the Environment, whose members have been appointed by Governor Cuomo. The board will decide whether the power is needed and whether it will be generated without adverse environmental impact.</p>
        <p>'We're So Darn Clean'</p>
        <p>Like Midwestern officials before them, New York's environmental officials argue that their regulations are strict enough to insure that the Inter-Power plant does not harm the air quality. In addition, state officials note, the plant follows the state's new energy plan, which calls for several coal-fired plants to be built using pollution controls similar to Inter-Power's.</p>
        <p>Inter-Power officials say that the plant's image has been unfairly tarnished by the older and dirtier coal-fired plants. ''You want to get facilities like ours on line because we're so darn clean,'' John D'Alessandro, a spokesman for the company, said.</p>
        <p>But opponents like Mr. Dufty of Inter-Power argue that building new coal-fired plants, even with sophisticated pollution controls, is folly at a time of deep concern over acid rain.</p>
        <p>By changing the chemical composition of the water, acid rain can transform thriving lakes into the aquatic equivalent of deserts. Foes of the Inter-Power plant note that just this week, a Federal study confirmed that emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, many of them at coal-fired power plants in the Midwest, are major contributors to the acid rain that has been damaging Northeastern lakes.</p>
        <p>These opponents insist that the so-called clean coal technology that the Inter-Power plant would use does not live up to its name.</p>
        <p>''Clean coal just means cleaner than it was five years ago, which isn't saying much,'' said John Seakwood, who founded the Berkshire Mountain Acid Rain Coalition to fight the plant.</p>
        <p>According to Inter-Power's estimates, the proposed plant would each year emit 2,337 tons of sulfur dioxide, a major ingredient of acid rain. Some older coal-burning plants emit twice as much sulfur dioxide. A plant burning natural gas, which many opponents of Inter-Power have advocated, would produce less than one-sixth of the amount of the Inter-Power plant.</p>
        <p>Inter-Power officials say that foes of the plant are being unrealistic in arguing it should be converted to natural gas, because no pipeline exists. ''People have to look at this project within the realm of the real,'' said Mr. D'Alessandro, the company spokesman.</p>
        <p>Events in the Mideast, Mr. D'Alessandro added, underscore coal's importance. ''Coal is a domestic resource,'' he said. ''This is an opportunity to put us on the right path not just environmentally, but economically.''</p>
        <p>Inter-Power officials charge out-of-state officials with using the plant as a convenient enemy in an election year. But officials in Massachusetts and Vermont insist that they are only demanding consistency.</p>
        <p>''All we're asking of New York is that they do the same that they and other Northeastern states asked of the Midwest,'' said Sherwood Guernsey, a Massachusetts state representative. ''Don't dump on us. Be good neighbors.''</p>
