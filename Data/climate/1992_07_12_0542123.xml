        <p>The Presidential campaign begins this week with the Democratic Convention. And Americans might actually turn out to be interested and tune in. The danger is that when they spot the young, handsome and articulate Clinton-Gore team, they will see two new politicians selling the same old snake oil.</p>
        <p>An understandably dispirited and cynical public does not want to hear Bill Clinton and Al Gore rehearse the usual list of noble promises. Rather, people want to know whether the two baby boomers have the ideas and guts to achieve those promises.</p>
        <p>So far, Bill Clinton and his Democratic Party platform promise one thing: a farsighted and much-needed revolution in foreign and domestic affairs -- without a followable road map or a realistic price tag.</p>
        <p>People are waiting to learn not only where the Clinton-Gore duo promises to lead, but how the journey can be made.</p>
        <p>Americans may not apply such an exacting standard to Ross Perot. Many still do not perceive him as a politician, and therefore assume his motives to be both pure and a sufficient substitute for substance.</p>
        <p>Nor are Americans likely to require much means-testing of George Bush. His supporters either think no action is the best answer or see him as a comfortable old shoe not to be lightly discarded.</p>
        <p>The Democrats' dynamic duo cannot count on such indulgence. They will have to start proving themselves this week. Their platform is not a bad place to begin.</p>
        <p>As convention documents go, the 1992 platform is not unduly vague. It has a compelling theme, and it reflects a political maturity (read desire to win) absent from platforms since the early 1960's.</p>
        <p>The preamble begins inspirationally: "Two hundred summers ago, this Democratic Party was founded by the man whose burning pen fired the spirit of the American Revolution -- who once argued we should overthrow our own government every 20 years to renew our freedom and keep pace with a changing world. In 1992, the Party Thomas Jefferson founded invokes his spirit of revolution anew."</p>
        <p>It goes on to call for "a revolution in government," for "an activist government" that solves problems in new ways and for "facing up to tough choices." But then, the choices turn out to be a little too easy.</p>
        <p>On deficit reduction, the document promises to do sensible things like "reform entitlement programs to control soaring health care costs" and increase taxes on the rich. But then it says spending will be cut without pain for senior citizens or the poor. And it never makes clear that most of the anticipated reductions would come from hoped-for growth in the economy. The plan is better than the Bush/Perot tripe, but still not convincing.</p>
        <p>The platform also pledges "defense savings," then follows with a long list of programs to help business and workers convert to civilian enterprises. Just right. But no mention is made of the fact that the longer and more costly the conversion process, the less the country can expect to reap from the Pentagon budget.</p>
        <p>The document also commits the party to a terrific set of environmental goals, domestic ones like more mass transit and international ones like targets for carbon dioxide reductions. And it rightly asserts that environmentalism is consistent with economic development, but does not show how.</p>
        <p>Platform junkies might take special note of the international section. It points to a new and needed emphasis on economics. But it also talks of using "military force decisively . . . to defend our vital interests," and of keeping troops in NATO and South Korea. These are clear overtures to the old conservative "Scoop" Jackson wing of the party to return to the fold.</p>
        <p>The platform represents solid mainstream thinking -- largely freed from the special, self-destructive pleadings of the last 20 years. It thus sets the stage for powerful and realistic acceptance speeches by the candidates.</p>
        <p>Americans want Mr. Gore to talk practically about converting defense industries and fixing the environment, areas in which he is almost uniquely expert. Above all, they need Mr. Clinton to tell them forthrightly and honestly of the pain, sacrifice and time necessary to revitalize the economy -- to go beyond suspiciously familiar promises and explain how he will get the job done.</p>
