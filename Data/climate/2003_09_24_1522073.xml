        <p>George W. Bush got off to a rocky start with the United Nations even before he was elected president, with declarations at the end of the 2000 presidential campaign that the American military should not take part in the sort of ''nation building'' in the Balkans, or Somalia, for which the United Nations had long been known.</p>
        <p>Once he became president, Mr. Bush quickly shifted tone on keeping troops in the Balkans, and indeed American troops are still in Bosnia and Kosovo. But for two and half years now his relationship with the United Nations has been largely one of mutual suspicion and frustration, punctuated by tactical alliances as Mr. Bush picks and chooses when to work with the United Nations -- in combating AIDS and nuclear proliferation -- and when to walk away.</p>
        <p>So it was hardly surprising that there was a distinct chill in the General Assembly this morning as Mr. Bush came full circle, making a plea for the United Nations to take a bigger role in Iraq despite the bitter dispute this year over his decision to topple Saddam Hussein without the United Nations' explicit approval.</p>
        <p>If there was any doubt that the breach between Mr. Bush and United Nations remains -- wider than ever, by some measures -- the evidence came today when Kofi Annan, the secretary general, roundly criticized ''pre-emption,'' a core of Mr. Bush's national security strategy.</p>
        <p>Without naming the United States, Mr. Annan dismissed the argument that ''states have the right and obligation to use force pre-emptively, even on the territory of other states and even while the weapon systems that might be used to attack them are still being developed.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, he suggested, again not naming names, had presented ''a fundamental challenge to the principles'' on which the United Nations was born, under American leadership, six decades ago.</p>
        <p>Once again, the United Nations and Mr. Bush seemed to be talking past each other.</p>
        <p>Indeed, no matter how much they act collectively on AIDS, or sex trafficking, the Bush administration and the world organization designed on the principle of collective security may simply never agree on how to handle perceived threats to peace, Mr. Bush's aides say.</p>
        <p>''It's the classic argument about how much of your nation's security you can put in the hands of an institution that has often been dysfunctional,'' a senior Bush advisers said recently. ''For George Bush, that's not a question worth debating.''</p>
        <p>''For Dick Cheney,'' the official added, ''it's not even worth raising.''</p>
        <p>Within the White House, Mr. Bush's aides insist that the president does not share the innate suspicion of the United Nations that some conservatives in his party have long voiced. They cite his decision a year ago to challenge the United Nations to enforce its own resolutions about Saddam Hussein -- a decision that put the issue squarely in the Security Council -- as evidence that he was willing to first let the United Nations deal with the issue. They cite his support of United Nations-affiliated institutions, like the International Atomic Energy Agency, as they confront Iran's nuclear program.</p>
        <p>''I actually think he wasn't as far from the fold as people think,'' said Richard Haass, who left the top policy-planning job at the State Department this summer, and often argued for greater interaction with the United Nations. ''After debate, they have taken the biggest foreign policy issues to the U.N.: post-9/11 Afghanistan and the run-up to the Iraq war.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Haass noted that ''this administration is also willing to bypass the U.N. when it feels frustrated.''</p>
        <p>''You are not seeing an unconditional commitment to the U.N. but also not undying hostility,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Perhaps not, but to many in the United Nations it often seems that way.</p>
        <p>To diplomats and others engaged in the United Nations, those campaign utterances signaled a new division of labor: the United States would handle showdowns, and others would handle the messy business of rebuilding.</p>
        <p>Then came Mr. Bush's rejection of the Kyoto protocol on global warming, and his withdrawal from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty. Those actions created the impression that given a choice between protecting American interests and working within a global system, Mr. Bush would regularly choose the former.</p>
        <p>The Sept. 11 attacks seemed to have changed that. Mr. Bush received a huge outpouring of sympathy -- and applause -- when he came to the United Nations while the wreckage of the World Trade Center was still smoldering. Even last year's address, when he challenged the United Nations to prove its relevancy, was well received, and he got the first resolution he sought, warning Mr. Hussein of ''serious consequences'' if he defied United Nations resolutions demanding disarmament.</p>
        <p>But when Mr. Bush gave up on winning approval for military action in mid-March, he put the blame on the United Nations, declaring ''the Security Council has not lived up to its responsibilities.'' He made it clear that he saw only a humanitarian role for the United Nations, not a political one.</p>
        <p>Now he speaks of a United Nations role in drafting an Iraqi constitution -- ''I mean, they are good at that,'' he said in a television interview the other day -- and to help oversee elections.</p>
        <p>In the end, some of Mr. Bush's advisers say, what is needed from the United Nations is legitimacy -- for a new government in Iraq, for the American occupation and any new countries that choose to send troops.</p>
