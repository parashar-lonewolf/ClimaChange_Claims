        <p>Party Confidential  By Lara Shriftman and Elizabeth Harrison, with Lara Morgenson.  176 pp., Bulfinch Press.  $29.99.</p>
        <p>The Cocktail  200 Fabulous Drinks.  By Jane Rocca, with drawings by Kat Macleod.  176 pp., Tarcher/Penguin.  $15.95.</p>
        <p>AWE is defined in Webster's Collegiate as ''an emotion variously combining dread, veneration and wonder.'' Check, check and check. After paging through ''Party Confidential,'' a photo diary and notional how-to book that examines 10 of the fetes organized by the event planners Lara Shriftman and Elizabeth Harrison during their confettied career in New York, Los Angeles and Miami, you will feel awe.</p>
        <p>You may also wonder if you've ever really been to a party in your life. For instance, at a publication party for ''In the Face of Jinn'' (a thriller involving the Taliban, a terrorist bombing in India and two California sisters), the women chose an Indian theme -- hiring dancers, sitar players and caterers from the Bombay Café in Los Angeles, and laying in a fleet of golf carts to transport guests from the driveway of Brian and Gigi Grazer's vast estate to the party entrance. ''No matter what kind of budget you have, this party is very easy to recreate at home,'' they declare.</p>
        <p>Certainly, if you throw a copycat party in your fourth-floor walk-up, you can cross ''golf cart rental'' from your to-do list, saving thousands right off the bat. The book is written for hosts of any age or budget, the authors reassure: ''You don't have to be Sean 'Diddy' Combs to throw a smashing soirée!'' Though it wouldn't hurt.</p>
        <p>Ms. Shriftman and Ms. Harrison try to keep your pocketbook in view as they recreate their merrymaking dioramas. For example, when they organized a pool party to celebrate Juicy Couture's swimwear, they held it at the Burndorf Estate (you may remember it from ''Mommie Dearest'') and sent out 250 pink and green invitations printed on foam kickboards. Want to try this at home? ''Check out the local Y and see if it has a pool for public use,'' they say.</p>
        <p>For a backyard surprise party for Serena Williams, who is famous among pals for her sweet tooth, Ms. Shriftman and Ms. Harrison laid out a buffet of handmade caramel marshmallows, chocolate-covered pretzels, Pixy Stix, Swedish Fish, Ding Dongs and Pop Rocks, and also provided cotton-candy and snow-cone booths. The pictures from the ''sugar orgy'' could be from a diabetic's death trap in ''C.S.I.'' Yet the guests -- among them Venus Williams, Molly Sims and Quentin Tarantino -- not only survived, they played Twister.</p>
        <p>Successes like these don't happen by accident. ''A week before the party, do a run-through so you have plenty of time to solve any unexpected problems,'' they advise. ''Do another run-through the day before and the day of the party to be absolutely certain you didn't forget a single thing.'' But also keep in mind the counsel of Alexandra Von Furstenberg: ''Guests don't want to see their host stressed out and running around. Remember, at a certain point you need to let go and let the party take its course.'' Hold that thought.</p>
        <p>BEFORE the concept of party planners existed, before goodie bags and caffeinated niche vodka, there was already a fantasy of the perfect drink, the perfect person to sip it and the perfect absinthe-hazed locale in which to enjoy it. Think of the poems of Baudelaire, the stories of Hemingway and Fitzgerald, or the color-drenched ads painted by the 1920's poster artist Leonetto Cappiello. In one print, a radiant flapper in a flame-red dress bears a huge crystal goblet filled with a Cognac sunburst.</p>
        <p>Jane Rocca's exquisite aperitif of a bartender's guide, ''The Cocktail: 200 Fabulous Drinks,'' is a reminder that nobody need let the practical realities of party-giving interfere with the myth of the ideal martini. She lays out an Impressionist palette of familiar and unfamiliar libations, from the Kyoto Protocol (kiwi, cucumber, lime, apple, rum and sake) to the Geisha Fizz (Champagne, litchis, sake, crème de gingembre, lime leaf) and the Blood Orange Bitter Hand (vodka, Cointreau, blood orange juice, bitters).</p>
        <p>She divides her concoctions into chapters by their main ingredient, from Champagne, which evokes for her a ''leggy blonde'' with ''a degree in neuroscience,'' to gin ( ''a little bashful and not quite willing to explore her princess qualities''), to vodka (''as racy as a Bond girl'').</p>
        <p>Her recipes are accompanied by gorgeous, playful watercolor collages by the artist Kat Macleod. In one, titled ''Sipping at the Sin Palace,'' a bob-haired minx in a party dress sits in a martini glass, one fuchsia-shod foot poised above the rim. In another, the illustration of ''Violent Little Ol' Lavender Girl'' (muddled mint leaves, lavender-infused gin, fresh litchi juice), an angular tulle-skirted archer pulls her bowstring taut.</p>
        <p>Even a bartender's staple like the piña colada is freshened with Ms. Macleod's art: a slender lady in a pleated yellow and brown gown and a bright green turban with a cockade -- a pineapple genie. ''The Cocktail'' is to be treasured for its inventive, assured recipes and for its magical drawings -- and ought to become a permanent feature of Ms. Shriftman's and Ms. Harrison's goodie bags.</p>
