        <p>An initial draft of a California global-warming regulation would require automakers to cut the amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases linked to climate change that their new vehicles emit by as much as 30 percent over the next decade.</p>
        <p>The draft is expected to be made public this week or next. People briefed on it said that the 30 percent figure could still be changed before it is released, though probably not by much.</p>
        <p>If adopted, the plan would have the effect of compelling the industry to make the cars, sport utility vehicles and other vehicles it sells in California much more fuel efficient. Unlike the particles and gases that contribute to air pollution and smog, whose emissions can be reduced technologically, the gases linked to global warming are an inevitable product of fuel combustion, and no way yet exists to filter them from engine exhaust. The only way to comply with the proposed rules would be to build vehicles that burn less fuel.</p>
        <p>Details of the draft proposal were described to The New York Times by environmental groups that were briefed on its contents last week.</p>
        <p>The California Legislature passed the nation's first law aimed at curbing global-warming emissions from cars and light-duty trucks in 2002. The law directed the state's Air Resources Board to come up with a plan this year. The proposal will be reviewed by regulators over the summer and fall, and then be subject to review by the state Legislature next year.</p>
        <p>If adopted, the proposed rules would take effect at the beginning of 2006, but give automakers until the 2009 model year to start meeting the requirements. As described to environmental groups, the rules would require progressively greater reductions in average emissions, reaching 30 percent in the 2015 model year.</p>
        <p>Officials at the state air board declined to comment.</p>
        <p>The proposal will have implications for Northeast states like New York that generally follow California's lead in setting air-quality rules. California, where smog has been an issue for decades, has the power to set alternative standards to Washington's because its regulations predated the federal Clean Air Act.</p>
        <p>The new rules would set the state even further apart from the federal government on environmental regulations. Nationally, fuel economy has stagnated for the last two decades as automakers have sold more sport utilities and large pickup trucks and a smaller proportion of passenger cars. The Bush administration has moved away from regulating global-warming emissions, withdrawing the United States from an international treaty known as the Kyoto Protocol meant to curb them.</p>
        <p>''It's important California leads the way, frankly, because of the lack of leadership on the federal level,'' said Assemblywoman Fran Pavley, the Democrat from the Los Angeles area who sponsored the state law.</p>
        <p>But California's strategy seems certain to face a legal challenge from the auto industry, and potentially from the federal government. Both may argue that the proposal is pre-empted by federal authority to set fuel-economy regulations.</p>
        <p>In an interview in May, William Clay Ford Jr., chairman and chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, said, ''The issue for us is always going to be if individual states are doing their own thing, versus the federal government -- it does make our life a lot more complicated.''</p>
        <p>''What will happen, of course, is that California will do its thing, and then New England will start to weigh in, New York State, and pretty soon we'll end up with a patchwork,'' he added. ''I really would like to have a national approach to this, because otherwise we and other manufacturers will have a really hard time responding.''</p>
        <p>Elisa Lynch, the global-warming campaign director of Bluewater Network, a San Francisco environmental group, said the plan did not go far enough. ''This is a very conservative approach as it is, and the law calls for them to go as far as they can,'' Ms. Lynch said. ''This is a minimum of what they should have done.''</p>
        <p>Kate Larsen, a policy associate at Environmental Defense, was more supportive. ''I think the numbers are good, and are based on real sound science,'' Ms. Larsen said. ''We think this is a good start and these reductions will be achievable.'' Based on their previously stated positions, other environmental groups are also likely to support the plan.</p>
        <p>Most automakers have argued in recent years against calls for smaller increases in fuel economy rules than those that would be required to cut global-warming emissions by 30 percent. When the Bush administration imposed a 1.5 mile-a-gallon increase in standards for S.U.V.'s and other light-duty trucks, G.M. argued that the effects would be calamitous.</p>
        <p>In an interview Tuesday night, Dave Barthmuss, a spokesman for G.M. in California, said, ''We are working as hard as we can to make our engines as clean and efficient as possible.'' He said he was not aware of the details of the draft plan because it had not been released.</p>
        <p>After years of disputes over auto regulation, California and the automakers called a truce last year, when G.M. and Chrysler dropped a lawsuit challenging the state's Zero Emission Vehicle mandate, which will require the production of millions of cars and trucks over the next 15 years that emit little or no smog-forming pollutants.</p>
        <p>Though the latest measure is aimed at a different problem, some technologically advanced vehicles, like hybrid cars, can help meet both goals. The new measure will be more of a challenge for the industry than the Zero Emission Vehicle rules.</p>
        <p>''When it comes to climate change, California is aligning itself with the rest of the world,'' Alan C. Lloyd, the chairman of the state air board, said in an interview last year. ''Somewhere along the line, we would expect a lawsuit.''</p>
        <p>Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has expressed support for the greenhouse-gas measure; on his campaign Web site, he said he would ''work to implement it and to win the expected challenges in court along the way.''</p>
