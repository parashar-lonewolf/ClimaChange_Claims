        <p>PAYING DOCTORS TO GIVE DRUGS -- Amgen and Johnson &amp; Johnson, two of the world's largest drug companies, are paying hundreds of millions of dollars to doctors every year in return for giving their patients anemia medicines, which regulators now say may be unsafe at commonly used doses. [Page A1.]</p>
        <p>SARKOZY'S APPROACH TO AIRBUS -- Airbus, Europe's proud but ailing plane maker, will provide a test for France's president-elect, Nicolas Sarkozy, and clarify whether he is, at heart, a free-market reformer or an economic nationalist determined to prop up France's industrial patrimony. [C1.]</p>
        <p>CHINA REAPS THE BENEFITS -- A United Nations program is supposed to help the developing world combat global warming by transferring billions of dollar from rich countries to poor countries.

        <p>DOW JONES LEAK INQUIRY -- Federal securities regulators are expected to examine the role of a Dow Jones director in the possible leak of inside information to a Hong Kong couple accused of making millions of dollars by buying the company's shares shortly before news of Rupert Murdoch's takeover offer.

        <p>CLAIMS AGAINST GRASSO REJECTED -- A New York appeals court dismissed four of six legal claims brought against Richard A. Grasso for his pay package of $190 million over eight years as chairman of the New York Stock Exchange. [C1.]</p>
        <p>SECOND CONTAMINANT IN PET FOOD -- A second industrial chemical that American regulators have identified as a pet food contaminant may have been intentionally added to animal feed by Chinese producers seeking larger profits, according to Chinese chemical industry officials. [C3.]</p>
        <p>A CONSPIRACY TO DIVERT MILLIONS -- Conrad M. Black's longtime former business partner testified at Mr. Black's criminal fraud trial that the two men conspired to divert millions of dollars of payments for assets of the newspaper company Hollinger International. [C3.]  NOW THE LAWSUITS -- Two officials of Dow Chemical, who were fired after the company accused them of conspiring in a buyout, have sued Dow Chemical for defamation, and Dow has sued them right back. [C1.]</p>
        <p>YES, IT'S A DIET PILL -- A marketing blitz with a budget estimated at more than $150 million in the first year is seeking to persuade skeptical dieters that a new over-the-counter pill can help them lose weight. Advertising: Stuart Elliott. [C2.]</p>
        <p>STRONG QUARTER FOR CISCO -- Cisco Systems reported a 34 percent growth in quarterly profits that it attributed to strong demand for high-speed Internet service.

[C9.]</p>
        <p>ENVISIONING THOMSON-REUTERS -- Thomson, the Canadian electronic information company, sketched out the details of its offer for the Reuters Group, the financial and general news service. The company would challenge Bloomberg for leadership in the financial data field. [C6.]</p>
        <p>SIGNS OF A COMEBACK -- Springfield, Mass., has endured closed mills, increased crime, population declines and the threat of bankruptcy proceedings. Now there are glimmers that the city has finally turned the corner. [C7.]</p>
        <p>A FLAT DAY AWAITING THE FED -- Wall Street battled back from sharp losses to close mostly flat as investors sought opportunities and adjusted their holdings ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting today. [C10.]</p>
        <p>WOLFOWITZ SEEKS MORE TIME -- Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. endorsed the request by Paul D. Wolfowitz, the World Bank president, for more time to defend himself against charges of misconduct, a delay that could give the Bush administration time to negotiate his voluntary resignation. [A6.]</p>
        <p>LIVING WAGE IS LAW IN MARYLAND -- Maryland has approved the nation's first statewide living wage bill, giving fresh momentum to a movement that seeks to raise wages through legislation. [A21.]</p>
