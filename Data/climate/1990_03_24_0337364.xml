        <p>LEAD: Consumers who think they can spot the bargains and the pitfalls in the supermarket aisles should pay close attention in the light bulb section, a part of the store where choices are multiplying, where common terms don't mean what people think they do, and the important measure, light, is almost always overlooked.</p>
        <p>Consumers who think they can spot the bargains and the pitfalls in the supermarket aisles should pay close attention in the light bulb section, a part of the store where choices are multiplying, where common terms don't mean what people think they do, and the important measure, light, is almost always overlooked.</p>
        <p>* Which gives more light for a given amount of electricity, a ''miser'' 55-watt bulb or a regular 60-watt bulb? Either. They are virtually equal.</p>
        <p>* Which gives more light, two 60-watt bulbs or one 100-watt bulb? Either. They are about equal, too.</p>
        <p>* Can you save money by paying extra for a long-life bulb, which is advertised as lasting twice as long as the regular bulb? Generally no. The long-life bulb generally has a higher purchase price per hour of service, and it gives off less light than a standard bulb of equal wattage.</p>
        <p>As is common in supermarkets, a pocket calculator is the surest way to evaluate the choices.</p>
        <p>Bulbs are sold by wattage, but a watt is not a measure of light. It is a measure of energy consumed; in this case, of how much electricity the bulb uses. A second figure on the box, lumens, tells how much light the bulb gives off.</p>
        <p>Some stores sell a 55-watt bulb meant to be a substitute for a standard 60-watt bulb. This is the first opportunity to misunderstand what is offered.</p>
        <p>The packaging that suggests the 55-watt model as a replacement for the 60, and the price, which is sometimes higher, could lead a buyer to conclude that the 55-watt bulb gives off the same amount of light, although it uses 8.3 percent less electricity. In fact, the 60-watt bulb gives off 870 lumens and the 55-watt model, 810 lumens, or about 6.9 percent less light, with a small gain in efficiency.</p>
        <p>Not All Bulbs Are the Same</p>
        <p>At the national average price of electricity, the 55-watt bulb would use about 30 cents less power over its lifetime. This saving could easily be outweighed by the higher price.</p>
        <p>That is not to say that all bulbs are the same. They do vary in number of lumens delivered per watt of energy supplied, an efficiency measure similar to miles per gallon for a car. Generally, the larger bulbs are more efficient. So a 100-watt bulb typically delivers 1,750 lumens, which is just slightly more than two 60-watt bulbs.</p>
        <p>A questionable economy is bulbs that are supposed to last longer. Figures will vary with wattage and brand. A standard 60-watt bulb might be advertised as lasting 1,000 hours, and a long-life bulb, 1,500 hours. At $1.75 each, the long-life bulb costs 12 one-hundredths of a cent per hour of service life. At 95 cents each, the standard bulb costs 10 one-hundredths of a cent per hour. And the standard bulb gives off 14.5 lumens per watt; the long-life bulb, 13.7. Still, the long-life bulb is a good choice if it is going into the ceiling fixture of your two-story entryway.</p>
        <p>Far more efficient bulbs are available. Halogen bulbs, for example, deliver almost 20 lumens per watt, or one-fourth more light for the same amount of electricity. And fluorescents deliver 40 to 80 lumens per watt, or 2 1/2 to 5 times as much light per unit of electricity. Several manufacturers now make fluorescents that screw into a standard incandescent base, and these are available in hardware stores and home centers.</p>
        <p>How important is efficiency in a light bulb? In commercial buildings, where lights are usually on all day, lighting efficiency is becoming a major consideration. For homes, the value depends on the use of the bulb. For example, a homeowner who substituted a 100-watt bulb for two 60-watt bulbs would be saving 20 watts. If the light burns for 6 hours a night, a customer in New York City and Westchester, Nassau and Suffolk counties would save about $6 a year in electricity. At the national average price for electricity, the figure would be closer to $4.</p>
        <p>That is a very modest difference. But in other applications, the choice is more important. For example, a consumer who keeps a 60-watt light burning 12 hours a day in a hallway or bathroom spends about $21 a year, at the average electricity price. A screw-in fluorescent would have an operating cost of only about $6.</p>
        <p>The fluorescents sell for $20 to $30, depending on model, but they typically last for 10,000 hours, compared with 1,000 hours for the standard incandescent. Over the 10,000-hour lifetime, at the average electricity price, the fluorescent bulb would save the consumer about $34 in operating costs, and because it would outlive about 10 incandescents, it would save, at minimum, another $10.</p>
        <p>But earning the savings would take the bulb its entire lifetime. That means that the usefulness of a better bulb depends on what it is being used for.</p>
        <p>Is It Worth the Price?</p>
        <p>In a 24-hour-a-day application, achieving the entire savings would take 14 months, making the initial investment attractive. But in a spare bedroom used only a few times a year, it could take decades, and the consumer would be better off buying a cheaper incandescent.</p>
        <p>In addition, fluorescents will not fit all fixtures and cannot be used outdoors.</p>
        <p>For consumers who take the broadest view, there are other more cosmic considerations, not just the cost of electricity. Substituting a more efficient bulb can reduce the amount of coal or oil burned. And the less coal burned, the less acid rain; the less oil used, the lower the trade deficit.</p>
