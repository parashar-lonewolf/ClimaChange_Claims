        <p>It is hard to track the blue whale, Balaenoptera musculus, at up to 170 tons the ocean's largest creature, which has almost been killed off by commercial whaling and is now listed as an endangered species. Attaching radio beacons to the behemoth is difficult, and visual sightings are too sporadic to give real insight into its behavior.</p>
        <p>So biologists were delighted early this year when, with the help of the Navy, they were able to track a particular blue whale for 43 days, doing nothing more intrusive than monitoring its sounds. The feat was possible because of the Navy's formerly top-secret system of underwater listening devices spanning the oceans.</p>
        <p>The whale, nicknamed Old Blue, was followed as it swam southward in the Atlantic Ocean from an area off Cape Cod to Bermuda, Florida and back again to an area north of Bermuda. All told, a trek of about 1,500 miles was closely monitored.</p>
        <p>"It's a big deal," Adam S. Frankel, a marine biologist at Cornell University, said of the Navy's surveillance system. "It's got the potential to completely revolutionize everything we do."</p>
        <p>Tracking whales is but one example of a heady new world just opening to civilian scientists after the cold war as the Navy starts to share and partly unveil its global network of underwater listening gear built over the decades to track the ships and submarines of potential enemies. The system is estimated to have cost $15 billion.</p>
        <p>Geologists announced at a news conference last week that they had used the system for closely monitoring a deep-sea volcanic eruption for the first time and that they planned similar studies.</p>
        <p>Other scientists have proposed to use the network for tracking ocean currents by listening to the beeps of drifting buoys, measuring changes in ocean and global temperatures by watching for shifts in the speed of sound in water and receiving acoustic data from remote sensors designed to detect such things as tsunamis and chemical spills.</p>
        <p>The Navy, in a statement, called the surveillance system "an unmatched acoustic observatory" for studying the world's oceans, adding that it had "tremendous potential to contribute to a variety of national agendas, both military and civilian." Overwhelming Endorsement</p>
        <p>Scientists who have tested the system heartily agree, often describing their experiences in hushed, slightly awed tones.</p>
        <p>Dr. Christopher G. Fox, a scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who helped monitor the recent undersea eruption, said last week that the Navy system could detect a blast as small as that from two pounds of high explosive at a range of thousands of miles.</p>
        <p>"It's a whole new world," he said in an interview.</p>
        <p>The speed of sound in water is roughly one mile a second -- slower than through land but faster than through air. Most important for eavesdropping, different layers of ocean water can act as conduits for sounds, focusing them in the same way a stethoscope does when it carries faint noises from a patient's chest to a doctor's ear. This focusing is the main reason that even relatively weak sounds in the ocean, especially low-frequency ones, can often travel thousands of miles. Finding Characteristic Sounds</p>
        <p>The Navy, from the earliest days of the cold war, worked hard to exploit such properties. The effort evolved into the listening system known as the Underwater Sound Surveillance System, which consists of long chains of underwater microphones planted on continental shelves. The physical separation of these undersea ears allows analysts and computers on shore to estimate the bearing, depth and distance of a source of sound. A computer usually translates the sound into a picture made of wiggly lines, known as a spectrogram.</p>
        <p>In tracking vessels, when a sound is picked up, it is compared with the acoustic "signatures" of various types of ships and submarines, which are said to be as distinctive as a person's fingerprint or handwriting. Such methods were vital for tracking the Soviet Union's submarines.</p>
        <p>The results of the Navy's sharing of the listening system with civilian researchers is often stunning. Last November the Navy began working with civilian whale experts, including Dr. Christopher W. Clark, a Cornell biologist who had pioneered a technique using sounds for counting bowhead whales as they migrate under the Arctic ice.</p>
        <p>Dr. Clark helped train Navy technicians, who proceeded to log tens of thousands of whale contacts. The civilian scientists, to their surprise, discovered a din of whale songs and sounds not unlike the animal noises that fill the air of any forest. 'Rewriting the Book'</p>
        <p>"We're finding that blue and finback whales are vocally active throughout the year, not just in the winter and spring, and that their sounds are detectable over hundreds of miles," said Dr. Clark, who heads the whale-monitoring effort for the Navy.</p>
        <p>The ultimate goal, Dr. Clark said, is to learn more about the migration and behavior of all whales, as well as to develop more accurate estimates of their numbers. "Basically," he said, "we will be rewriting the book on whale distribution and movement."</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the listening program may help solve the fundamental mystery of why whales make the sounds they do. Some scientists believe these may be partly for communication, and partly for use as a kind of low-frequency sonar that helps them navigate or find food.</p>
        <p>In the future, the Navy's surveillance system may also help settle the question of whether gases in the atmosphere have begun to warm the planet and its oceans in the so-called greenhouse effect.</p>
        <p>The speed of sound in water varies with its temperature: the warmer the water, the faster the sound. Significant changes in the speed through thousands of miles of water would signal a change in the average temperature of the water through which the sound passed.</p>
        <p>The Navy is working with scientists at the University of Washington, among others, to prepare experiments in which the speeds of distant pulses of sound will be measured with the aid of the surveillance system. Over time, such measurements could become a vital gauge of global warming.</p>
        <p>"This whole thing is like Galileo's telescope, which let us see the sky much better," said Dr. Fox of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, who used the Navy gear to monitor the recent deep sea eruption off the coast of Oregon.</p>
        <p>"Now we're able to listen to the ocean much better," he said. "It's going to open the door to all kinds of new things."</p>
