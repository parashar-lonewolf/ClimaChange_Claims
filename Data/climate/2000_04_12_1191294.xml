        <p>After the Iceberg, Global Warming</p>
        <p>The screen star LEONARDO DICAPRIO, whose television interview with President Clinton touched off a furor at ABC News, can write, too. He tackled an assignment for Time magazine, grinding out an article for a 98-page special issue on the environment that will go on sale next week.</p>
        <p>''The whole idea was to have something written more or less in his own words,'' said CHARLES ALEXANDER, the editor of the special issue.  ''I'm sure he had some of his people look over it. We corrected a few mistakes, but basically, they're his thoughts.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. DiCaprio, KEN SUNSHINE, said that Mr. DiCaprio had written the article longhand. ''It was typed by somebody in his manager's office,'' he said. ''He really did it himself. You can ask the people at Time. He kept missing deadlines.''</p>
        <p>Well, did he?</p>
        <p>''You know how editors set artificial deadlines,'' Mr. Alexander said, sounding diplomatic, as editors sometimes must. ''He got it in in plenty of time to get it in the magazine.''</p>
        <p>Mr. DiCaprio was not the only celebrity -- or the only person not on Time's staff -- who was asked to contribute.  Among the others were ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR., RICHARD LEAKEY and MARC REISNER, the author of ''Cadillac Desert: The American West and Its Disappearing Water'' (Viking, 1986).</p>
        <p>''I personally think that celebrity involvement in environmentalism is a good thing because it helps draw attention,'' Mr. Alexander said.  And as for Mr. DiCaprio, ''His piece showed some knowledge of the issues.  Frankly, Leonardo may know more about global warming from having studied up on it than some of the Washington correspondents for ABC. I'm not sure what the problem is there. I guess it's the blurring of entertainment and journalism, but I don't think card-carrying journalists have exclusive rights to journalism.''</p>
        <p>George Hamilton I'm Not, Allen Says</p>
        <p>WOODY ALLEN is sending things to the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission again.</p>
        <p>In February, he made a three-minute video to dramatize his opposition to plans for an apartment building at Madison Avenue and East 91st Street, just behind his town house. He also testified at a commission hearing at City Hall.</p>
        <p>Yesterday the commission heard from Mr. Allen again, this time in writing.</p>
        <p>After arguing that ''more oversized building is so totally unnecessary,'' he said that his opposition to the apartment project had nothing to do with whether the building would block the sunlight in his backyard.</p>
        <p>''He wants to make clear he hates the sunlight,'' the commission's chairwoman, JENNIFER J. RAAB, told a hearing at the commission's headquarters at 100 Old Slip in Lower Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Sure enough, in the letter, Mr. Allen wrote, ''I'm fair skinned and I freckle.''</p>
        <p>The commission, which has the power to reject the apartment building or order it scaled down, heard from the architect, CHARLES A. PLATT. Like Mr. Allen, he lives nearby; he said he had chosen cream-colored brick for the building because it would be nice to look at from his dining room window. He also defended his design as appropriate for the neighborhood, part of the Carnegie Hill Historic District.</p>
        <p>Same Time, Different Station</p>
        <p>News travels fast; news anchors seem to travel faster. JIM ROSENFIELD, a news anchor for the noon and 5 p.m. newscasts on WCBS-TV,  will be moving on after the station tried to assign him to a different newscast.</p>
        <p>He is headed for WNBC-TV, where he is expected to become one of the anchors on its 5 p.m. newscast.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosenfield had been at Channel 2 only since October 1998.</p>
        <p>But last week, the station brought in a new news director, JOEL CHEATWOOD, and began the latest in a long line of overhauls in its news department.</p>
        <p>Friends of Mr. Rosenfield said that Channel 2 had offered him several different anchor jobs, all of which he turned down.</p>
        <p>That opened a window in his contract, which had more than two years left to run. Channel 4 jumped through the window.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosenfield will begin appearing on his new station in a few weeks, his friends said.</p>
