        <p>Former Vice President Al Gore should know that our air quality has improved dramatically in the last 30 years (''The Selling of an Energy Policy,'' Op-Ed, April 21), and that this has occurred even as our population, economy, jobs and energy consumption have grown.

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Former Vice President Al Gore should know that our air quality has improved dramatically in the last 30 years (''The Selling of an Energy Policy,'' Op-Ed, April 21), and that this has occurred even as our population, economy, jobs and energy consumption have grown. In fact, history shows that without economic growth, there are no appreciable environmental improvements.</p>
        <p>Our best manufacturers and engineers work constantly on the next generation of cleaner, more efficient energy technologies and look forward to the day their products are economically viable. But for now, our economic health is tied to fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore complains about a conspiratorial executive branch. He should instead work with business to improve energy conservation and supply.</p>
        <p>JERRY JASINOWSKI  President, National  Association of Manufacturers  Washington, April 22, 2002</p>
