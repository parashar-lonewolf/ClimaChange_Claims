        <p>LEAD: Alarmed by a steep decline in the number of ducks and other waterfowl in North America, the United States and Canada are embarking on a last-ditch effort to rebuild the flocks of the migratory birds.</p>
        <p>Alarmed by a steep decline in the number of ducks and other waterfowl in North America, the United States and Canada are embarking on a last-ditch effort to rebuild the flocks of the migratory birds.</p>
        <p>The two Governments, working with private conservation and wildlife management groups, are putting into motion the first steps of a long-range North American Waterfowl Management Plan. The goal, which the planners hope to achieve by the year 2000, is to restore the continent's waterfowl to the levels of a decade ago.</p>
        <p>The waterfowl populations of the 1970's were far below the size of the great flocks that the first European settlers found on this continent, wildlife biologists believe. But they say that level is the best they can hope for, given the extent of habitat destruction.</p>
        <p>The biologists say the loss of habitats constitutes the primary reason for the dwindling number of the birds. The plan, therefore, will focus on protecting and improving the remaining wetlands and grasslands that ducks, geese and swans need for breeding, nesting and migrating. In some cases, efforts will be made to restore breeding and nesting grounds already destroyed. Prairies Once a Paradise</p>
        <p>Because they are so critical in many stages of the waterfowl's life cycle, the prairies of western Canada and the north central United States will receive particular attention.</p>
        <p>Not long ago, as nature keeps time, the North American prairies were an earthly paradise for waterfowl. The land was speckled with potholes, marshes and similar wetlands ideal for feeding and breeding, and a sea of grass provided nourishment and nesting grounds concealed from predators.</p>
        <p>Today, however, much of the prairie has become a kind of duck's desert. Many of the wetlands have been drained for agriculture and industry, and most of the grass has been plowed under and the land tilled for crops.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the continent's population of waterfowl, particularly ducks, has plummeted. Wildlife managers and conservationists recognized that conventional methods of protecting the flocks by maintaining refuges and regulating hunting were no longer sufficient, and they pressed for a new approach.</p>
        <p>In 1986 Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel and Canada's Environment Minister, Tom McMillan, signed the waterfowl management plan, which is expected to cost $1.5 billion over the next 12 years.</p>
        <p>''This is the most colossal recovery plan ever attempted,'' said Harvey K. Nelson, who was recently selected as the first American executive director of the plan. He said the plan was the first opportunity wildlife managers have had to work on a continental scale to save ducks. ''It is also probably the last opportunity,'' he added.</p>
        <p>James H. Patterson, director of the plan for Canada's Wildlife Service, emphasized the urgency of the situation. ''If we don't do anything,'' he said, ''we will just have to watch the populations decline and the benefits waterfowl provide to our societies will decline as well. It is our last chance.'' Hunting Already Limited</p>
        <p>Already, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service has sharply reduced hunters' bag limits for several species of ducks because of declining population. But experts say the ducks cannot be saved by limitations on hunting.</p>
        <p>''The bottom line is, we can stop hunting - and we are not foreclosing that possibility - but if you don't have habitat you don't have ducks,'' said one official of the service.</p>
        <p>The loss of waterfowl habitat accelerated after World War II as modern farming methods allowed marginal lands to be cultivated and as agricultural economics rewarded farmers who put every inch of land under the plow. At the same time, the increasing use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides as well as growing air pollution and acid rain endangered the remaining waterfowl habitat.</p>
        <p>On top of this, recent periods of drought contributed to a further shrinking of the habitat.</p>
        <p>In 1955, the first year that formal estimates were published by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the breeding populations of the 10 most common duck species stood at 42.7 million. By 1987 the breeding population of these 10 species had dwindled to 30.3 million.</p>
        <p>In the 1980's, some of the most common duck species, such as mallards, blue-winged teals and northern pintails, declined sharply. Others are losing ground slowly or barely holding their own. Concentrating on Ducks</p>
        <p>While the preservation of geese and swans is also a goal of the plan, most of the resources will be concentrated on ducks. Mr. Nelson said that while oil and mineral exploration in northern Canada has had an impact on nesting Arctic geese, most goose and swan populations are relatively stable because their breeding grounds are under less pressure.</p>
        <p>Given the thousands of square miles of habitat already lost and the degraded quality of much of the rest, it would be ''impossible'' to restore duck populations to their size in the 1950's, Mr. Nelson said. Instead, the ''realistic goal is to reach the levels of the 1970's,'' about halfway between populations of the 50's and current levels, he said.</p>
        <p>The management plan encompasses much of North America, including waterfowl wintering grounds along coastal wetlands and the hardwood bottom lands of the lower Mississippi Valley, where trees and wetlands used by the birds are rapidly being destroyed to create new farmland. But considerable effort will focus on the prairie pothole region, a 300,000-square-mile area of western Canada and the north central United States.</p>
        <p>This area is speckled with hundreds of thousands of potholes, shallow depressions in the earth left by retreating glaciers. The potholes collect rain water that runs off from the surrounding land. They have a high rate of evaporation, filling up during wet seasons and often drying out completely during drought cycles every 10 or 12 years.</p>
        <p>Rich in nutrients, the potholes are critical for waterfowl, which descend upon them in breeding and nesting seasons.</p>
        <p>Spurred by a favorable world grain market in the 60's and 70's and by Federal price support levels, farmers moved aggressively to expand acreage under cultivation. In many cases, this meant draining the potholes. It also meant plowing the grassy upland areas around the potholes that were necessary nesting habitats for many of the duck species.</p>
        <p>The recent depression in world food markets as well as government incentives intended to dissuade farmers from cultivating marginal lands have slowed the destruction of potholes and other waterfowl habitats. But the destruction has not ended. Working With Farmers</p>
        <p>The waterfowl plan seeks to protect, restore and enhance these pothole environments, along with other habitats used by the ducks while migrating and during winter. It specifies a variety of tools for doing so, starting with the purchase of some pothole areas and other critical habitats.</p>
        <p>But as Mr. Nelson noted, the migratory fowl inhabit much of the continent at some part of the year and ''there will never be enough money to buy all the land they need.''</p>
        <p>The primary thrust of the program will entail making arrangements with farmers to manage their land in ways that will benefit waterfowl, said Dr. Patterson of Canada's Wildlife Service. One part of this, he said, would be the restoration of prairie potholes already drained. Another part would entail replanting upland areas with grass where birds could feed and nest without being exposed to foxes, skunks, racoons, dogs and other predators.</p>
        <p>Farmers would also be encouraged to leave their fields in stubble after the harvest to provide food for migratory birds.</p>
        <p>Incentives, such as payments for agreements to conserve rather than develop farmland, would be given to the landowners to encourage participation, Dr. Patterson said.</p>
        <p>Another approach would be to make the remaining pothole areas and wetlands more productive. David Wesley, conservation programs manager for Ducks Unlimited, one of the private conservation groups participating in the plan, said that as the number of acres of suitable duck habitat continues to shrink, ''we have to produce more ducks per acre.''</p>
        <p>Enhancing these wetlands' usefulness, he said, requires heavy investments to pay for dikes to retain water and the creation of artificial islands. Replanting Native Grasses</p>
        <p>This spring, the American and Canadian wildlife managers will start a long-range, $10 million program to improve the quality of waterfowl habitat in the Quill Lakes area of Saskatchewan, Dr. Patterson said. The program calls for replanting native grasses in upland areas to provide nesting cover for ducks. It may also involve taking some farmland out of regular crop rotation and planting it with a legume such as alfalfa that would be useful to farmers but would also provide an excellent habitat for nesting ducks.</p>
        <p>Of the $1.5 billion envisioned for the management program, $1 billion would be spent in Canada because so much of the critical waterfowl habitat is there. The United States would supply about 75 percent of the money spent in Canada.</p>
        <p>Only a part of of the $1.5 billion would be appropriated by the Governments of the two countries. The rest would be raised by state and provincial governments and by private organizations like Ducks Unlimited.</p>
        <p>About two-thirds of Ducks Unlimited's members are hunters, but Mr. Wesley said that the organization is not simply trying to save ducks for people who shoot them. Waterfowl are also of great value to birdwatchers, he noted. But even people who may never see the great flocks of water birds like to know they are there, he said.</p>
        <p>''Ducks are part of the American spirit,'' he said of the joint North American effort.</p>
