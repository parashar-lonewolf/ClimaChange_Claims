        <p>LEAD: IN the last 10 years, scientists and engineers have taken long strides toward the day when alternative energy sources can compete with oil from the Middle East, and some of the more promising alternatives are on the verge of practicality.</p>
        <p>IN the last 10 years, scientists and engineers have taken long strides toward the day when alternative energy sources can compete with oil from the Middle East, and some of the more promising alternatives are on the verge of practicality.</p>
        <p>But a drastic cut in funds for energy research over the past decade has slowed progress in many areas. And even if the research effort is accelerated now, experts say, the energy system that has grown up around petroleum is so vast, so pervasive and so entrenched that it will be years and in most cases decades before the alternatives replace oil on a large scale.</p>
        <p>It is clear, say the experts, that the biggest and most important gains in the struggle to wean the country from petroleum are to be made in transportation, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of all oil consumed in the United States. If alternative fuels and technologies could somehow magically displace gasoline today, they would eliminate most of the need for imported oil at one stroke.</p>
        <p>Now, stimulated in the last few years mostly by environmental concerns, scientists and engineers have brought to the brink of fruition, or close to it, a number of alternative ways to power motor vehicles. Many of them are based on resources that are renewable rather than depletable and that emit less pollution than gasoline.</p>
        <p>Scientists working with advanced enzymatic techniques are steadily improving the process by which wood is converted to ethanol, a form of alcohol fuel. By making the process more efficient, they have reduced the cost of wood-derived ethanol to the equivalent of about $2.15 for a gallon of gasoline, from $5 in 1980, and they expect to reduce it to about $1.15 by the end of this decade. American gasoline prices have been around that level in the last few years and are now higher. The use of wood and other vegetation opens up a potentially vast source of renewable raw materials, or feedstocks, and researchers are developing ways to produce the wood more efficiently.</p>
        <p>Commercially produced methanol, another form of alcohol fuel, is already as cheap or cheaper than gasoline. Recent analyses by the Environmental Protection Agency have found that it now costs 90 cents to $1.10 to buy methanol that will propel a car as far as a gallon of gasoline. And as part of an attempt to capitalize on this economic fact, the agency's emission-control technology laboratory in Ann Arbor, Mich., expects in about two weeks to begin testing the first prototype of an engine especially designed for methanol.</p>
        <p>American automobile manufacturers, meanwhile, have built engines designed especially for ethanol-fueled autos and installed them extensively in Brazilian cars. Within the last five years auto makers here and abroad have also brought to technological maturity flexible-fuel engines that burn methanol, ethanol and gasoline interchangeably, or any mixture of the three. The blending makes it possible for the alcohol fuels to replace gasoline gradually, with a minimum of disruption in the supply system. As part of its stringent new policy against air pollution, California is to serve as a pre-production testing ground for the cars.</p>
        <p>By the end of the century, electric vehicles may also be making a dent in urban transportation. All three major American auto companies have been working on new electric vans and cars. As part of a demonstration project, General Motors, for example, plans to begin production next month of the first 60 modern electric vehicles produced in this country.</p>
        <p>The years and decades ahead are likely to see a vigorous competitive struggle among these fuels and technologies, as well as compressed natural gas, which is being sold experimentally as an auto fuel in the United States.</p>
        <p>The potential of these alternatives as an antidote to dependence on imported petroleum is clear: foreign oil and petroleum products contributed 15.3 quadrillion B.T.U.'s, or ''quads,'' to the nation's energy consumption last year; the burning of gasoline, measured last year at 13.74 quads, can be said to have soaked up most of the imports.</p>
        <p>The extent to which alternatives could displace oil in energy sectors besides transportation is less clear, some experts say. ''In theory,'' alternatives based on renewable resources ''could be directed to the replacement of oil in all sectors,'' said Dr. Thomas D. Bath of the Solar Energy Research Institute, a Government-supported national laboratory in Golden, Colo. But it would take more money and time to direct alternative resources to specific oil targets in industry, businesses and homes than in transportation, he said.</p>
        <p>The gains would probably be incremental and piecemeal - gradually replacing oil heat in homes with solar heat, natural gas or electricity, for example, or displacing some of the remaining oil in the generation of electricity with renewable alternatives like solar energy or wind power, or with nuclear power. But oil now accounts for only 5 percent of electricity generation, leaving relatively less room for improvement in that sector. Some oil, moreover, is used as feedstocks in the production of petrochemicals and asphalt and is not energy-related. Research Progress Depends On Spending Although some of the alternatives not based on fossil fuels may soon challenge both the technology and the economics of oil, experts say, none is likely to supplant oil in a widespread fashion for some time.</p>
        <p>''You are very quickly struck by the fact that none of them are ready at all to compete at large scale with fossil fuels,'' said Dr. William Fulkerson, an associate director of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory who oversees the lab's programs in advanced energy systems and who directed a study of the subject last year.</p>
        <p>Federal funds for research on energy supplies declined to about $1.5 billion in 1990 from about $5 billion in 1980, in constant 1990 dollars, according to a study by Dr. John P. Holdren, professor of energy and resources at the University of California at Berkeley. ''We've allowed our programs for research and development on these new options to deteriorate drastically,'' he said. ''We are just not making the progress that would have been possible if we'd maintained those 1980 levels.''</p>
        <p>Without an increase in research funds, according to a study published last March by five national laboratories, energy derived from renewable sources would probably grow to 15 percent of the total by 2030. The study included a wide range of renewable energy sources, including, for instance, solar energy, wind power and fuels made from wood and other types of vegetation, or biomass.</p>
        <p>If Federal expenditures for research, development and demonstration projects were doubled, to about $3 billion a year over the next 20 years, the study calculated, renewable energy's share of total energy use could more than triple, from 8 percent in 1988 to 28 percent, by the year 2030. It found that under these conditions of accelerated research, the use of transportation fuels made from wood and other vegetation would grow the fastest, accounting for 8 quads a year by 2030.</p>
        <p>''That seems like an awful lot of time,'' said Dr. Bath, who headed the study and whose laboratory participated in it. ''But what most people don't have a good feel for is how big the energy system is, how much capital is sunk into it. It's 5 percent of gross national product, and changes in anything that big take a lot of time.'' Because of this, he said, years are required for a new technology or fuel to spread through the system on a large scale even though it works well and its cost competes with existing energy sources.</p>
        <p>The process might be speeded up, experts say, if the price of oil rose high enough and remained there over the long term, either because of market workings or tax policies. But energy experts say that suppliers are not inclined to convert to alternatives more quickly unless they are convinced that oil will be permanently more expensive. Temporary price shocks brought about by Middle Eastern crises are not enough, they say.</p>
        <p>''Prudent people aren't going to go out and spend some fraction of a trillion dollars based on a dictator grabbing control and manipulating things,'' said Dr. Robert L. Hirsch, the manager of research at ARCO Oil and Gas Company in Plano, Tex., who was formerly assistant administrator of the Energy Research and Development Administration, the predecessor of the Department of Energy. Obstacles Other Fossil Fuels Have Drawbacks Generally speaking, experts say, fossil-fuel alternatives to imported oil are not likely to compete on a broad scale as transportation fuels any sooner than renewables. The fossil-fuel alternatives include, chiefly, natural gas and petroleum derived from coal and oil shale. Synfuels, as these latter have been called, were the object of an intensive federally sponsored research and development program undertaken after the 1979 oil-price shock but abandoned later as prices of crude oil plummeted. For the most part, their use also emits more air pollution than other alternatives, and some energy experts believe their emergence is unlikely in the foreseeable future.</p>
        <p>Natural gas may play at least an interim role. Until wood and other vegetation can be more fully developed as feedstocks, for instance, it seems likely to provide the main feedstock for methanol. And coal may not be completely ruled out. Methanol's proponents say that advanced conversion techniques coupled with more efficient engines would make it possible to derive methanol from coal. They say it would emit 80 percent less carbon dioxide than gasoline, reducing an emission that many scientists fear will cause the Earth's climate to warm.</p>
        <p>In the 1980's, the electric power industry largely weaned itself from oil, but did so mostly through increased reliance on coal, one of the most polluting of fossil fuels. From 1978 to 1988, according to Federal figures, oil's share of electricity production dropped to 5.5 percent from 16.5 percent, while coal's share rose to 60 percent from 44 percent.</p>
        <p>With nuclear energy on hold and fusion power decades away, the industry is now straining to reduce coal's share by expanding renewable sources of energy like wind and solar power, and to develop clean-coal technologies. Some experts say it would be a mistake for the transportation industry, in switching to alternatives to oil, to go the same route. Liquid Fuels Alternatives To Gasoline As transportation fuels, methanol and ethanol share an advantage in that they can each be produced from a variety of feedstocks - for example, natural gas, garbage and even sludge for methanol, grain for ethanol, wood for both. Neither alcohol fuel emits as much pollution as gasoline when burned.</p>
        <p>Both ethanol and methanol can also be used in existing cars if some engine modifications are made, but experts say that new engines are necessary to make the alcohol fuels fully competitive. ''We are not suggesting retrofitting,'' said Charles L. Gray Jr., the director of the E.P.A.'s Ann Arbor laboratory, where the prototype of the new methanol engine is about to be tested. Both alcohol fuels pack less energy per gallon than gasoline, and the new engines are designed to help compensate for this.</p>
        <p>''We would probably say methanol is the fuel to beat,'' said Mr. Gray. This is largely because the enlistment of natural gas as a ready feedstock has already made methanol economically competitive. But pipeline capacity makes natural gas in the United States vulnerable to sudden shortages in times of extraordinary demand, and much of the gas envisioned as methanol feedstocks would probably come from Canada, Mexico and the Soviet Union. Moreover, the burning of methanol has been criticized as emitting twice as much formaldehyde gas, a possible carcinogen, as does the burning of gasoline. Mr. Gray says this can be readily controlled, and that methanol emits far fewer other carcinogens than gasoline.</p>
        <p>In the United States, ethanol has so far been produced from corn and is sold as an additive that, when combined with gasoline, produces gasohol. It receives substantial Federal subsidies, however, and some experts say that ethanol production would be limited by the size of the corn crop. Scientists are therefore looking toward ethanol derived from wood and other vegetation. At the Solar Energy Research Institute, scientists are using a variety of enzymes to break down the cellulose components of wood more efficiently, producing higher yields of ethanol that in turn bring down its cost per unit of feedstock.</p>
        <p>''If ethanol from cellulose can be commercialized,'' said Mr. Gray, the proponent of methanol, ''it will be very competitive with methanol.''</p>
        <p>If either ethanol or methanol were to rely heavily on wood as a feedstock, some scientists say, it could put heavy pressure on forests and other stands of vegetation and could create conflicts in land use. Anticipating this, scientists at the Oak Ridge laboratory are working with universities and forestry companies to improve the per-acre productivity of trees by growing and harvesting them, much like crops, on a cycle of six to eight years. Since the growing trees would absorb carbon dioxide, they would offset the carbon dioxide emitted by the burning of ethanol or methanol.</p>
        <p>''If you ran the system right,'' said Dr. Fulkerson, ''there would be no net addition of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.'' Looking Ahead Electricity And Hydrogen Electric vehicles, of course, emit no pollutants at all - except for those emitted by the electric power plants that recharge the vehicles' batteries - and their development by auto companies is proceeding apace.</p>
        <p>''I think that by 2000, the impact of electric vehicles should begin to be felt,'' said Larry O'Connell, the manager of the transportation program at the Electric Power Research Institute, who has been working with auto companies in developing electric cars and vans.</p>
        <p>For the most part, their range is still limited by battery technology. General Motors' new van that will go into limited, preliminary production next month, for instance, has a range of 60 miles when half laden, said Mr. O'Connell. Its conventional lead-acid battery can be charged overnight; if it is charged when the van is idle throughout the day, it has achieved 175 miles in a day. Its top speed is about 50 miles an hour, half laden. The van is envisioned as an around-town delivery vehicle, and will be tested first as part of electric utilities' vehicle fleets.</p>
        <p>The Chrysler Corporation is working on a minivan with a nickel-iron battery that represents the next advance. Its range with an overnight charge is between 110 and 120 miles and its speed is about 70 miles an hour - about the same as a gasoline version of the minivan with a 2.2-liter engine.</p>
        <p>Cars are also being developed that use electricity for city driving but switch to gasoline for longer trips, but all of the electric vehicles are perhaps two decades away, at a minimum, from any large-scale impact since it takes years for existing vehicles to be replaced.</p>
        <p>In the farther future, perhaps, are hydrogen-fueled vehicles. Auto companies have experimented with them off and on for years. ''It's quite a clean energy system, but the cost has always been regarded as too high,'' says Dr. Joan Ogden, a research physicist at the Center for Energy and Environmental Studies at Princeton University, who has long studied the problem. The cost could come down close to the range of gasoline, she said, if photovoltaic technology could be harnessed to the production of hydrogen, cutting its cost. A number of European companies are working in that direction, she said, but practical application will not come until some time in the next century.</p>
        <p>In the end, given the slow rate at which any of the alternatives are likely to be adopted, many of the scientists and engineers who work with them urge a time-tested interim strategy for reducing dependence on oil: conservation and increased efficiency in the use of petroleum.</p>
