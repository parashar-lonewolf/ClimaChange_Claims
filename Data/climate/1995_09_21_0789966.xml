        <p>In another effort to roll back environmental regulations, conservative Republicans in Congress are moving to postpone the phasing out of chemicals that scientists say are destroying the earth's protective ozone layer in the stratosphere.</p>
        <p>Representative John T.

        <p>In another effort to roll back environmental regulations, conservative Republicans in Congress are moving to postpone the phasing out of chemicals that scientists say are destroying the earth's protective ozone layer in the stratosphere.</p>
        <p>Representative John T. Doolittle, Republican of California, today introduced a bill to postpone, until Jan. 1, 2000, a ban on the production of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's, which scientists widely consider the major destroyers of ozone. Production is now supposed to cease as of next Jan. 1 under both United States law and an international agreement negotiated in the Bush Administration and ratified by the Senate in 1993.</p>
        <p>Mr. Doolittle told a House subcommittee today that he was introducing his bill because "there has not been a sufficient showing of scientific evidence to justify" the Jan. 1 deadline. Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the Republican whip, has introduced his own bill to repeal the domestic ban on CFC production. He told the same committee that the connection between CFC's and human health was debatable, adding: "Is the cost worth it? I don't think so."</p>
        <p>Prospects for passage of the bills are seen as problematic at best. Kevin Ring, Mr. Doolittle's legislative assistant, said the DeLay bill had virtually no chance, not least because its sponsor, as part of the House leadership, did not have time to push it. Mr. Ring said the more moderate Doolittle bill might pass the House, but could fall into a "black hole" in the Senate, and in any case would undoubtedly be vetoed by President Clinton.</p>
        <p>But he said the effort provided a basis for future action, and today's hearing by the House Science Committee's Subcommittee on Energy and Environment served as a forum for the expression of a new skepticism about the seriousness of the ozone-depletion problem.</p>
        <p>Most scientists who have worked on the problem regard its main scientific aspects as essentially settled. Some basically testified to that effect today, reasserting that CFC's were indeed destroying ozone, that a weaker ozone shield allowed biologically harmful ultraviolet rays to reach the earth and that these cause skin cancer, cataracts, damage to the immune system and harm to natural ecosystems. With the multinational ban in place, it is widely expected that ozone loss will peak around the end of the century, and that a recovery period of about 50 years for the ozone layer would then begin.</p>
        <p>Dr. Robert T. Watson, associate director for the environment in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and an ozone expert, testified that the increased levels of harmful ultraviolet-B radiation reaching the earth's surface "will, not may," have adverse consequences for human health and ecological systems. He said there was "absolutely no doubt" that the problem was caused by human activities, not natural processes.</p>
        <p>He said his testimony represented the views of "the very, very large majority" of scientists working on the problem, but several of his main points were challenged by dissenters. Dr. Sallie Baliunas, an astrophysicist representing the George C. Marshall Institute, a Washington-based research organization, questioned whether ozone depletion caused by humans could actually be detected amid wide fluctuations in ozone levels that occurred naturally.</p>
        <p>Both she and Dr. S. Fred Singer, emeritus professor of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia and a designer of the ozone-detection instrument now used on satellites, disputed the contention that ozone depletion inevitably led to observable increases in ultraviolet radiation.</p>
        <p>Scientists have indeed been hard pressed to come up with solid evidence that the radiation is increasing outside Antarctica and its environs. A 1993 Canadian study detected an increase at Toronto from 1989 through 1993. "We examined that paper," Dr. Singer said today, adding that its statistics were faulty and that the actual increase was "zero, zilch, nothing, nada."</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Dr. Daniel L. Albritton, director of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's aeronomy laboratory at Boulder, Colo., testified that it was "an absolute certainty" that if ozone decreased overhead, ultraviolet radiation increased on the earth's surface.</p>
        <p>As the exchange of scientific fire was getting under way, Representative Tim Roemer, Democrat of Indiana, held up a copy of the executive summary of the World Meteorological Organization's 1994 assessment of the ozone problem, which is the most recent one. It is widely regarded as the most authoritative examination of the situation available. Noting that the summary listed seven pages of scientists from around the world who had reviewed the assessment, he asked Representative DeLay what he thought about it.</p>
        <p>Mr. DeLay said he could not comment because he had not seen it. "My assessment is from reading people like Fred Singer," he said.</p>
