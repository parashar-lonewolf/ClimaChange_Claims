      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Each new day seems to bring further proof that something must be done to limit the pollutants that originate in the coal-fired power plants of the Midwest and are carried by air currents into the Northeastern United States, where they contribute mightily to urban smog and acid rain. The latest evidence is a survey conducted by the General Accounting Office. It found a big reduction in one of the pollutants, sulfur dioxide, but a dramatic rise in another pollutant, nitrogen oxide, which is accelerating the decline of many Northeastern lakes and streams, particularly in the Adirondacks.</p>
        <p>The report is one more reason for state and federal officials to keep pressing their legal and regulatory efforts to force the Midwestern polluters to clean up their plants. It also sends an important signal to Congress, which has two opportunities to address the problem. One is a bill sponsored by three New Yorkers -- Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat, and Representatives Sherwood Boehlert and John Sweeney, upstate Republicans -- that would require a 50 percent reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions below those required by the 1990 Clean Air Act. The other is a broader effort by Mr. Boehlert and like-minded Democrats to require stiff new controls on dirty power plants as part of any bill deregulating the utility industry. Such a bill would be aimed not only at reducing pollution but at leveling the playing field in an industry where dirty power tends to be cheaper than clean power.</p>

        <p>Each new day seems to bring further proof that something must be done to limit the pollutants that originate in the coal-fired power plants of the Midwest and are carried by air currents into the Northeastern United States, where they contribute mightily to urban smog and acid rain.

        <p>The report is one more reason for state and federal officials to keep pressing their legal and regulatory efforts to force the Midwestern polluters to clean up their plants. It also sends an important signal to Congress, which has two opportunities to address the problem. One is a bill sponsored by three New Yorkers -- Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat, and Representatives Sherwood Boehlert and John Sweeney, upstate Republicans -- that would require a 50 percent reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions below those required by the 1990 Clean Air Act. The other is a broader effort by Mr. Boehlert and like-minded Democrats to require stiff new controls on dirty power plants as part of any bill deregulating the utility industry. Such a bill would be aimed not only at reducing pollution but at leveling the playing field in an industry where dirty power tends to be cheaper than clean power.</p>
        <p>Congress's responsibility here arises from the fact that the 1990 act did not fully address the complex sources of acid rain, which has been killing off fish in Adirondack waterways for many years. At the time, sulfur dioxide was believed to be the overwhelming cause of acid rain, so the act not only mandated sharp sulfur dioxide reductions nationwide but set up an innovative emissions trading scheme that great reduced industry's costs of compliance. By contrast, the act gave industry a more leisurely timetable for reducing nitrogen oxides, and also spared hundreds of the oldest, dirtiest power plants from tough new controls in the false expectation that they would soon be retired.</p>
        <p>Power industry officials contend that because the nitrogen oxide requirements of the 1990 Clean Air Act did not kick in until 1996, more time is needed to study their effects before imposing tighter standards. But the 1990 requirements still need strengthening, if only because they do not address the older, ''grandfathered'' plants.</p>
        <p>The industry also asserts that reducing emissions from coal-burning utilities will not solve the problem because one-third of the nation's nitrogen oxide comes from cars and trucks. But even if such vehicle emissions made a big difference in the Adirondacks, for which there is little evidence, that is no reason not to tighten controls on the utilities. It is past time for these companies to start cleaning up. If they will not, Congress should make them.</p>
