        <p>Refund anticipation loans have been a profitable business for tax preparers like H&amp;R Block and Jackson Hewitt.</p>
        <p>There is still a good business in fronting customers cash equal to the tax refund they expect to receive from the government. There is just a lot less of it now. The number of refund anticipation loans declined 22.5 percent last year and that was after two years of little-to-no growth.</p>
        <p>Fees from the service, which peaked at $1.24 billion in the 2004 tax year, according to data gathered by the National Consumer Law Center, dropped an equal percentage, to $960 million, in 2005. No one is ready to proclaim the demise of the refund anticipation loan, but the dropoff is probably no fluke. Figures for the 2006 tax year are not yet available as the tax filing deadline is not until April 17.</p>
        <p>(Why the 17th and not the 15th? April 15 falls on a Sunday, so Monday, April 16, would be the filing day except that it is the Emancipation Day holiday in the District of Columbia. Since District holidays are considered to affect the whole nation, procrastinators get two extra days to finish their tax returns.)</p>
        <p>The refund loan change is occurring in part because consumers are wising up to alternatives that are fast and less expensive. Also, a shift to a new form of the loan is proving risky to the preparers. At the same time, the largest tax preparer, H&amp;R Block, has cut fees for the loans as much as a third and issued a debit card that consumers without bank accounts can use that gives them the opportunity to bypass the loans altogether. Block, besieged by its troubles in subprime mortgage lending, says that its tax business results are ''solid.''</p>
        <p>Anyone who files a return electronically and has the government directly deposit the money into a bank account can expect the money to arrive in as few as seven days. (The Internal Revenue Service says it will deliver in less than two weeks.)</p>
        <p>It is catching on. The I.R.S. said that 35.6 million taxpayers who filed early chose to have their refunds deposited directly into a savings or checking account, up 5.2 percent over last year at the same time. It also said 82 percent of all refunds are deposited directly.</p>
        <p>Anyone earning less than $52,000 a year can file taxes electronically free under the Free File program.  That means a quick refund, and, since the I.R.S. banned refund anticipation loans under this service, there is no risk of temptation. Seventy percent of taxpayers are eligible for the service. (Taxpayers can also split a direct-deposit refund into as many as three separate accounts, the I.R.S. said.)</p>
        <p>The refund anticipation loan business works like this. After filling out a customer's tax return and finding that money is due from the United States Treasury, a tax preparer will ask if the customer wants the money now rather than waiting. This is good business because the loan carries almost no risk to tax preparers. They know the exact amount the government will send to pay off the loan. They can also check with the I.R.S. before granting the loan to make sure there are no liens against the refund.</p>
        <p>Despite the low risk, tax preparers charge hefty fees: about 3 percent for sums of $4,000 or more and as much as 12 percent for smaller sums because the base fee is usually $20 or $30. The interest rate, though it applies only until the refund arrives, would make a loan shark drool.</p>
        <p>The taxpayer does get the money within two days.</p>
        <p>Whether it has been the ease of electronic filing or the additional disclosures about fees and interest rates that are hurting the business, the tax preparers have reacted with new products.</p>
        <p>Those offerings, however, have carried higher risks for them. Last year, Jackson Hewitt, the No. 2 preparer, got a jump on its competition by offering refund anticipation loans based on the year-end pay stub rather than the W-2s that employers send at the end of January. Because the offer drew customers in early, H&amp;R Block matched the service this year. Then Jackson Hewitt raised the ante by issuing holiday loans that were based on a November pay stub, and the others followed suit.</p>
        <p>The pay stub refund loans turned out to be risky business. The preparer did not know the exact amount of the refund because the tax return was not prepared, which meant it was not going to get the guaranteed payoff from the government.</p>
        <p>Enough of the borrowers never paid back the loans that HSBC, the bank that H&amp;R Block uses to make the loans, announced quietly last week that it was exiting the business.</p>
        <p>Dan Smith, a spokesman for H&amp;R Block, said the company supported HSBC's decision to discontinue the product. ''We encourage other national lenders to follow suit,'' he said.</p>
        <p>John Hewitt, the founder and chief executive of Liberty Tax Service, said: ''I am happy if it just goes away. It's just a bad product for the consumer and the bank.''</p>
        <p>In reaction to the new environment, H&amp;R Block has introduced a debit card that cuts the cost of a refund anticipation loan. Called the Emerald PrePaid MasterCard, the debit card is issued by a bank that Block opened last year.</p>
        <p>''It's a decent product,'' said Chi Chi Wu, a staff lawyer at the National Consumer Law Center in Boston. Coming from a consumer advocate who has spent years chastising the tax preparation industry for its practices, that is hardly faint praise.</p>
        <p>The product wins kudos because it is not just for the refund anticipation loans. It allows people who do not have bank accounts to get some of the advantages provided to those who do. ''We have been supportive of that,'' Ms. Wu said.</p>
        <p>For instance, a refund can be deposited directly to the card, avoiding the whole refund anticipation loan business, and the money is available quickly. Block said it would not charge a fee for loading the card with the direct deposit.</p>
        <p>Cardholders can also ask their employer to deposit paychecks directly to the card, and Block won't charge for that either. That can save hundreds of dollars a year on check-cashing fees. (Block says it charges only for using automated teller machines and for over-the-counter withdrawals.)</p>
        <p>Having a bank account would be better, since sticking money on a debit card makes it temptingly easy to spend. But at least 10 million American adults do not have bank accounts. Block has already issued 1.9 million cards, many more than it expected.</p>
        <p>As for refund anticipation loans, Block does not charge to put them on the card, and the fees on such refund loans end up being about a third less on a loan of $3,000, or $62.14, the company said.</p>
        <p>A few other things to think about this year's federal income taxes even if you have already filed:</p>
        <p>THE EXCISE TAX REFUND -- This year only, the I.R.S. is refunding a 3 percent federal excise tax that was collected on long-distance phone calls that should not have been collected. You can expect to receive $30 to $60 back, maybe more.</p>
        <p>But the I.R.S. has noticed that among the early filers, 30 percent have not asked for it. It is free money, something you do not get from the government very often. It would be a shame to miss it.</p>
        <p>You can file for the standard refund, $30 for a single taxpayer and up to $60 depending on the number of dependents you claim you support. If you are using tax software or paying a preparer who uses the software, it will automatically add the refund.</p>
        <p>But you are entitled to more if you can prove your claim. If you think it is worth your time and you kept your phone bills from March 2003 through July 2006, tally up any excise tax on long-distance calls. Maggie Doedtman, manager of advice delivery at H&amp;R Block, said you might have to search on the bill for the right charge. ''Sometimes it is not that obvious,'' she said. Look for the words ''federal excise tax'' or ''FET.'' Then you'll have to fill out an additional form, 8913 . Be sure to also tally up the excise tax on long-distance calls on your family's cellphones or VoIP phones as well. It all counts.</p>
        <p>Even those people who do not need to file a tax return, like retirees or students, can claim the refund with a 1040EZ-T, a form that is downloadable from the I.R.S. Website . Mr. Hewitt of Liberty Tax said he did not expect the I.R.S. to spend a lot of money auditing those returns.</p>
        <p>ENERGY TAX CREDITS -- If you tried to reduce your carbon footprint this year with new windows, attic insulation, a fuel-efficient furnace or solar roof panels, you can get money back from the government. You can even get it if you bought a hybrid car.</p>
        <p>Taxpayers can get a credit  of 10 percent of the cost, up to $500, for easy improvements like new doors or a water heater. (Tax credits are subtracted directly from the tax a family owes, instead of being subtracted from taxable income like a tax deduction.) You can claim a 30 percent refund, or up to $2,000, for a major project like a solar heat system. The credit will be available in this current tax year so if you spend money on energy saving home improvements, save the receipts. You can take additional credits in 2007.</p>
        <p>But obtaining the credit for the cars, which can be as much as $3,150, will be harder. Anyone who buys the popular Toyota Prius after March 31 will not be eligible. Congress suspends the credit on any model selling more than 60,000 units, which Prius did this year. Other hybrid cars  and ''alternative motor'' vehicles are still eligible.</p>
