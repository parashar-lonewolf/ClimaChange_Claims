        <p>WHILE the melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which would raise worldwide sea levels by 20 feet, has long been considered one of the direst potential consequences of global warming, some polar specialists are suggesting an even more catastrophic scenario.</p>
        <p>Meeting last month in Woods Hole, Mass., specialists from many parts of the world debated the stability of the huge East Antarctic Ice Sheet. Could global warming cause it to slip into the sea? Even partial slippage would inundate many coastal cities and much of the world's food-producing land.</p>
        <p>It was a polite but emotional debate, evoking past confrontations between those who believe the history of the earth has been punctuated by occasional catastrophes and the "uniformitarians" who rebel against such concepts.</p>
        <p>Antarctica is divided by the Transantarctic Mountains into two icy regions. To the west, south of the Americas, is an ice cap that rests on a submerged archipelago comparable in size to the Philippines. Great ice "streams," flow relatively rapidly toward the sea. That the whole sheet might run off into the ocean is widely regarded as a long-term possibility.</p>
        <p>The ice on the other side of the Transantarctic Mountains rests on a buried continent with a few inland basins. Those who believe slippage may occur say they would expect a partial shedding of the ice, which they say occurred repeatedly until the Pliocene, three or four million years ago. It is estimated that a shedding of one-third of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet would raise global seas more than 150 feet.</p>
        <p>A total melting of polar ice, including that on Greenland, would inundate all low-lying areas. This occurred during the Cretaceous Period, 65 million to 135 million years ago.</p>
        <p>Opponents of the slippage theory cite evidence showing that the Antarctic ice has been stable for at least 17 million years. Cores extracted from the floors of the seas that surround Antarctica, they say, show no curtailment of sediment from melting icebergs, as would be expected had the continent become partly ice free.</p>
        <p>But proponents argue that at no time since the Pliocene, when summer temperatures in the Arctic were 10 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than they are today, has the earth been as warm as some predict it soon will be. The great East Antarctic ice sheet, in places three miles thick, was formed after the Pliocene. Before that, they propose, the ice waxed and waned, although it was never as extensive as now.</p>
        <p>It was agreed at the meeting that during the Pliocene the world was warmer than it has ever been since, particularly in the Arctic. Forests migrated to the shores of the Arctic Ocean and, say proponents of the great slippage, trees grew near the South Pole, having retained the foothold on the continent that they gained when the southern continents were joined. If some of the East Antarctic ice melted at that warming, they say, it could do so again.</p>
        <p>This melting and subsequent rise in sea level, proponents argue, would account for the sea floor fossils found in glacial deposits on mountains in the area. These deposits, known as the Sirius formation, are themselves remarkable because they are far above any contemporary glaciers, indicating that the East Antarctic ice was at one time much higher than it is today, flowing over the mountains. Most recently Sirius-type deposits have also been found in the Prince Charles Mountains on the Indian Ocean side of Antarctica.</p>
        <p>Proponents of the theory say that the tiny oceanic fossils, known as diatoms, could have lived in a shallow inland sea during an ice-free period before they were carried onto the mountains by glacial activity. Or, the fossils could have been lifted from the basins by winds. Diatom specimens occasionally have been found in places in Antarctica where they could only have been windblown. Scientists of the slippage school argued that fossils in the Sirius formation are of Pliocene age, rather than a mix of ages, as would be expected if they came from more distant sources and at different times.</p>
        <p>It was such claims and rebuttals, as well as the potential importance of the answer, that prompted the National Science Foundation to sponsor the recent "Pliocene Antarctic Glaciation Workshop" at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Participants came from as far as Australia and New Zealand, as well as from Britain, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Italy, Sweden and research centers throughout the United States.</p>
        <p>Prominent among those arguing for major variations in earlier East Antarctic ice cover were Dr. Peter N. Webb and Dr. David Elliot of the Byrd Polar Research Center at Ohio State University in Columbus, and Dr. David M. Harwood of the University of Nebraska in Lincoln. The skeptics included Dr. George Denton and Dr. David Marchant of the University of Maine in Orono; Dr. James P. Kennett of the Marine Science Institute of the University of California at Santa Barbara; his former student, Dr. David A. Hodell, now at the University of Florida in Gainesville; and David D. Sugden of the University of Edinburgh in Scotland.</p>
        <p>If there were great discharges of ice during the Pliocene they would have raised sea levels substantially throughout the world. Determining the extent of such rises has been frustrating because the land in many of the coastal areas being measured has been rising and falling due to erosion, geologic action and ice ages. These sites include New Guinea, New Zealand, Enewetak Island in the mid-Pacific, the Middle Atlantic coastal plain of the United States and several places in Alaska.</p>
        <p>The debate is not the first of this kind in geologic history. There have been seemingly preposterous theories that later proved correct, such as the idea that the continents are moving relative to one another. And there have been those that were correctly ridiculed. One of those was a proposal in 1964 by A. T. Wilson of Victoria University in New Zealand that the ice ages may have been caused when surges of Antarctic ice into the sea formed giant regions of floating, sun-reflecting ice that cooled the climate.</p>
        <p>Smaller surges are well documented. They occur in Alaska where certain glaciers grow so large that their flow greatly accelerates. In northern India the Kutiah Glacier is said to have advanced 360 feet a day.</p>
        <p>In 1972, John T. Hollin, a British graduate student at Princeton University, proposed that an Antarctic slippage might be sudden enough to cause sudden global flooding. He cited the "London brickearth," a deep clay deposit used to make bricks for London's old buildings. During the last century the remains of "elephants," generally assumed to have been victims of the Biblical flood, were found in this clay. The swifter animals, it was said, avoided drowning "by escaping to the hills." The "elephants" are now believed to have been ice age mastodons. The idea of sudden flooding is not widely accepted.</p>
        <p>A generation ago J. Harlen Bretz of the University of Chicago proposed that the coulees and "scablands" of central Washington had been eroded into the bedrock by a catastrophic flood at the end of the ice age. He was ridiculed but later proven right.</p>
        <p>Albert Einstein lent his support to the hypothesis that ice accumulation in Antarctica sometimes causes the earth's crust to slip around the planet's interior, setting life on new evolutionary paths. Dr. Immanuel Velikovsky, a widely read promoter of catastrophic theories, argued that ice accumulation in Antarctica could affect the earth's rotation. This theory never won scientific adherents since the earth's equatorial bulge makes the spin too stable for any sudden change.</p>
        <p>A number of the participants in the Woods Hole meeting who had not taken sides beforehand said when it was over that not enough was known of past sea levels or other clues for a convincing answer either way.</p>
