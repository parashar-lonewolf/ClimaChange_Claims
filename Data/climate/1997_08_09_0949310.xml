        <p>Disbanding Bosnian Police  In a decision that diplomats said could be both helpful and dangerous, the American general in charge of NATO forces in Bosnia disclosed a plan to force paramilitary police forces to disband or to face being disbanded by NATO soldiers. Diplomats and human rights monitors said that paramilitary police were the most responsible for enforcing the will of nationalist hard-liners.</p>

        <p>Strike Turns Violent in Kenya  A strike in Kenya called by advocates of constitutional reform turned violent as mobs beat a policeman to death, looted shops and broke windows in Nairobi. A rally in support of the strike turned bloody when a crowd of people recognized a plainclothes policeman and beat him to death. Western Governments and human rights groups have accused police of brutality in previous demonstrations.</p>

        <p>South African Talks Stop  South Africa's second-largest black party said it would break off talks with the African National Congress on ending political violence in the province of Kwazulu-Natal. Testimony before a commission investigating apartheid-era atrocities linked the Inkatha Freedom Party to hit squads; angry leaders of the party demanded an investigation of the impartiality of the panel, which they called a creation of the African National Congress.</p>

        <p>Pilot Error Cited in Guam Crash  United States officials in Guam said that newly gathered evidence points to pilot error, not mechanical failure, as the cause of the Korean Air jetliner crash. The National Transportation Safety Board said the pilots were in control of the plane and did not know they were flying too low. Officials said 225 people died in the crash and hundreds of their relatives have flown to Guam from Korea and are waiting anxiously, and sometimes angrily, for remains to be identified and returned to them.</p>

        <p>Famine Worsens in North Korea  About 80,000 children in North Korea are in immediate danger of dying from hunger and disease and at least 800,000 more are suffering malnutrition, Carol Bellamy, executive director of Unicef, said. The famine is a result of two years of floods and two months of severe drought.</p>

        <p>8-10  U.P.S. Strike Affecting Many Small Businesses  The strike by the United Parcel Service has hurt many smaller businesses around the country, especially those on tight schedules or margins. If problems for small businesses grow, they could mean serious problems for the nation's economy since they account for more than 50 percent of all jobs.</p>

        <p>U.P.S. and the teamsters' union held their second straight day of intense talks aimed at ending the five-day-old walkout. But after a lack of major progress, union officials warned teamster locals nationwide to be prepared for a long strike.</p>

        <p>Monsignor Ignites Controversy  Two weeks after a Dallas jury awarded a record $120 million in finding that the local Catholic diocese failed to stop a priest from sexually abusing parish boys, a former top church official who supervised the priest set off an uproar by suggesting the boys' parents were at least as much to blame as the church.</p>

        <p>Mars Trip '100% Success'  NASA declared the month-old mission of the Mars Pathfinder ''a 100 percent success'' since the project's minimum goal was 30 days of full operation on Mars. The spacecraft has transmitted almost 10,000 pictures. Its roving companion Sojourner has traversed some 165 feet of Martian surface, closing in on a circumnavigation of the landing site. And both are still going strong after more than a month exploring the rocky flood plain of Ares Vallis.</p>

        <p>Party Denies Withholding Data  Roy Romer, the Democratic Party's national chairman, said there was ''no intention to withhold or delay'' the production of Democratic documents sought by the Senate committee investigating campaign finance abuses and that a recent failure to do so was ''an innocent mistake.''</p>

        <p>Diabetes Initiative Announced  President Clinton announced an effort to combat diabetes, a metabolic disease that afflicts millions of Americans. In a ceremony at the Georgetown University Medical Center, Mr. Clinton called attention to $2.1 billion in Federal spending over the next five years for diabetes treatment and research that is included in the newly signed balanced budget legislation.</p>

        <p>Psoriasis Patients Warned  The Food and Drug Administration warned psoriasis patients to contact a doctor immediately if they are using a treatment called ''Skin-Cap'' because it secretly contains powerful steroids that can produce serious side effects.</p>

        <p>Local Phone Choices Grow As MCI Enters the Market  MCI began offering local residential telephone service in New York City and its nearby suburbs, becoming the first major competitor for Nynex's four million customers in the region. The move by MCI, the country's No. 2 long distance company, opens a new round in the fight for the metropolitan telephone market, a battle that consumer advocates hope will ultimately lead to lower phone bills, advanced communications services and more attention to customers.</p>

        <p>Protest Over Bus Access  More than a dozen handicapped demonstrators rolled their wheelchairs in front of a Greyhound bus and disrupted ticket sales for four hours at the Port Authority bus terminal in Manhattan to protest what they said was a lack of access to vehicles belonging to the largest interstate bus company in the country. The protesters sang ''If we can't ride, nobody rides.''</p>

        <p>The Festivals of Colorado  Summer arts festivals have taken root in the Rockies, spreading this year like alpine wildflowers to 13 Colorado ski towns. In Telluride, for example, once a backwater silver-mining town, there is a jazz festival, a blues festival, a bluegrass festival, a theater festival, a dance festival and two film festivals. Choking on culture, townspeople recently rebelled and created a guaranteed festival-free weekend in late July: The Nothing Festival.</p>

        <p>F.D.A. Loosens Ad Rules  The Food and Drug Administration issued new guidelines for prescription drug advertising on radio and television that it said would make the advertisements more useful to consumers. The guidelines, which have been under consideration for months, will allow drug manufacturers to describe the benefits of the drugs without providing long, detailed notices of the side effects. Instead, the F.D.A. said, the drug companies would only be required to include in the advertisements a ''brief summary'' of the major risks. The ads could include a toll-free number or an Internet address where consumers could get more details.</p>

        <p>3 Markets Suffer Setbacks  Rallies in stock, bond and currency markets all came to an abrupt halt. The price of the 30-year bond plunged, pushing the yield up to 6.63 percent. Most of the stock market's major indexes fell 1.5 percent or more. And the dollar dropped as well: 3 percent against the Japanese yen and 1.1 percent against the German mark. Analysts had a hard time accounting for the size of the declines. The outlook for the stock market, interest rates and the dollar are all still generally positive.</p>
