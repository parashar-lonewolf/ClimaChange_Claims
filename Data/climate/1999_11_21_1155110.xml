        <p>Waiting for friends using the restroom at an Exxon station at 23rd Street and 10th Avenue, Andrew Harris didn't notice the sign on the building wall at first.</p>
        <p>''I kind of just ignored it because I thought it was another Exxon blurb,'' said Mr. Harris, a British scientist attending a conference in North Carolina.</p>
        <p>The sign, by Peter Fend, an artist who has long plumbed political themes, says ''Global Warming.'' The confusion with the gas station is intentional. The  construction is rendered in red, white and blue plastic and mimics the Exxon  logo.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fend said his work was intended to provoke thought about global warming as a current issue.</p>
        <p>The sign, on an outside wall of the Nikolai Fine Art gallery, is a holdover from a recent exhibition there.</p>
        <p>Daniel Silverstein, who owns a Chelsea gallery under his name and was making a purchase at the gas station recently, appreciated the sign's guerrilla approach.</p>
        <p>''I like what it's shouting,'' he said. He added that Mr. Fend ''makes one of the strongest statements about pollution that I've seen.''</p>
        <p>As art, he said, the sign ''is very direct,'' but ''the devices are not at a high enough level to be important art.''</p>
        <p>The sign, which will stay up until the end of February, is a preview of a larger show on global warming that Mr. Fend will participate in with four other artists, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fend said many inquiries about works like the Exxon sign have been made. One was from P.S. 1, an art gallery in Long Island City, Queens, directly behind a BP gas station. If a sign is put there, it ''will be in green and yellow, to blend with the BP colors,'' Mr. Fend said.</p>
