        <p>SPRING just got a little brighter. The moon rose orange and full above the Green Mountains early last week, and the earthy chuckling of wood frogs gave way to spring peepers.</p>
        <p>In Northern New England, the seasonal succession of frog calls is a minimalist composition, lasting from about late March until early August. The orchestra pit is submerged among emergent reeds, lakes, meadow sedges, beaver ponds, roadside ditches and quarry pools. Wood frogs start singing while there's still snow on the ground, soon followed by peepers. American toads and leopard frogs come into full voice around May.</p>
        <p>The melodic ululations of the gray tree frog, as it descends from the branches and rain gutters to breed, are ''the sounds of sticky summer evenings,'' according to Jim Andrews, a herpetologist from Middlebury College, ''when you're lying in bed with the windows open.''</p>
        <p>The variation in frog calls, their pitch and their timing, helps avoid interference; each species tends to have its own frequency, an amphibian version of a radio dial, giving shape to the season for listeners. Green frogs and bullfrogs generally bring up the rear. After the heady performance of about a half dozen species, the bullfrog's ''jug-of-rum'' vibrato can bring solace to those fretting over the hemisphere's gradual tilt away from the sun. These large-bodied frogs can afford to take their time, relying on permanent bodies of water like lakes and sloughs. Their tadpoles are slow to mature. It will be two winters before they transform from the larval stage into fully formed frogs.</p>
        <p>But spring is the time for explosive breeders and quick development -- peeper and wood frog tadpoles hatch and become full-fledged frogs in about three months. Last week, after three nights of downpours, I coaxed myself up the road, to what had been an ankle-deep pond anchored by a still leafless oak. The pond was now deep enough to flood the boots of anyone foolish enough to cross it, perhaps someone out looking for frogs.</p>
        <p>As I walked the pond, Charles Burchfield's watercolors came to mind, with his shimmering works evoking brookside music and insect calls. But as the night grew deeper, it became more abstract: the peepers' upslurs, intense as early spring daffodils, filled the dark canvas above the meadow, underscored by a dark chorus of wood frogs. It became a Rothko.</p>
        <p>These vernal ponds, filled with snowmelt and spring rain, attract frogs as well as salamanders and fairy shrimp. For a while, they seemed more ephemeral than usual. March was dry, and burning bans went into effect across the state. The frogs seemed desperate to find a mate before the pools dried up. (Amphibians breathe through their skin: desiccation means suffocation.)</p>
        <p>Of course, spring breeders are always frantic. They must find a mate and fertilize eggs in time for the young to hatch, go through the larval tadpole stage and metamorphose into adults, all before the pools disappear sometime in midsummer. But even as they race the drying up, the temporary nature of the ponds is part of the draw for these amphibians. The summer drought prevents fish -- which can feed on frog eggs, tadpoles or adults themselves -- from becoming established in the vernal pools.</p>
        <p>Spring peepers are less than two inches long. A couple in amplexus, the mating posture with the male holding tight to the female's back, could easily fit in a palm. In fact, a Frisbee could dome the entire breeding territory of most males. Their dominion may be small, but the peepers' piercing advertisement call hits the skull with all the meekness of a snowball.</p>
        <p>Making these advertisement calls is one of the most costly activities of a male frog's life: metabolic rates can be 10 to 20 times those of frogs at rest. (A typical human runner raises his metabolism about 11 times the resting rate.) Since spring breeders call as soon as they emerge from hibernation, they must rely on energy stores retained through the winter. The pouches that expand around throats or between their eyes and ears are believed to help amplify the sound coming from the vocal cords. Frogs can extend the duration of their calls by forcing air back and forth between pouch and lungs.</p>
        <p>FEMALE peepers are attracted to the vigor of the male's call -- its volume and frequency. Gray tree frogs prefer calls of longer duration. Female green frogs assess their mates by the quality of their habitat. They cruise male territories and circle in front of their intended, touching the mate of their choosing. Female bullfrogs prefer a male with a deep voice, which is correlated with size, a characteristic that helps males defend their territory against other frogs. Smaller rivals may be consumed.</p>
        <p>Many of these larger species prefer permanent water to the vagaries of vernal ponds. The next night I drove down to Lake Champlain. The long trill of an American toad rose above the marsh like a flagpole. It was a single voice in a storm of peepers, a tryout for the coming month when toads would come into full voice in Vermont. The call of the northern leopard frog is sometimes described as a snore. But who could sleep with these ear-splitting peepers? In this meadow, the leopard frog's call sounded more like a Geiger counter, followed by a muffled guffaw.</p>
        <p>My brights formed a cattle guard of rain in front of the car. Leopard frogs lifted their heads from the road, as if rising from asphalt. And there were flattened bodies everywhere. These meadow frogs had survived a long winter beneath the ice, emerged from a lake full of frog-eating fish, only to be ground along the macadam, innards bright as sushi, on their way to their breeding grounds.</p>
        <p>The number of frogs on the road notwithstanding, as many as eight frog species are in decline across the Northeast, and the western chorus frog, once a resident of the islands in Lake Champlain, hasn't been heard in Vermont for several years. Frogs may be disappearing for a number of reasons -- acid rain, heavy metals, high rates of malformities, even road mortality have taken some blame -- but one certain cause is the destruction of natural habitat. ''Ten square miles of habitat are consumed each year in Vermont,'' Mr. Andrews said, and about half the state's wetlands have been destroyed.</p>
        <p>I swerved across the double yellow to avoid a leopard frog, only to swerve back to avoid a toad and begin rehearsing my lines for the inevitable approach of flashing lights, eager to question my driving condition. But then I stopped the car. A beautiful toad, an egg-carrying female with brick-red warts and a plump speckled belly, got the better of me. I pulled over, judged her waypoint in the roadside ditch, and escorted her off the asphalt. I could see dozens of silhouettes up ahead -- it was going to be a long ride home.</p>
