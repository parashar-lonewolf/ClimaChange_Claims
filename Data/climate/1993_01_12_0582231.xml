        <p>SOME chemicals suggested as replacements for gases that destroy the Earth's protective ozone shield could instead add to the danger of global warming for tens of thousands of years to come, scientists calculate.</p>
        <p>The chemicals, called fluorocarbons, have no effect on the stratospheric ozone layer that shields living things from skin cancer and other biological harm caused by the sun's ultraviolet rays. But like a number of other waste industrial gases, chiefly carbon dioxide, the fluorocarbons do trap the sun's heat. A continuing buildup of these heat-trapping atmospheric gases could cause a disruptive and even catastrophic warming of the earth's climate.</p>
        <p>Production of chlorofluorocarbons, halons and most other substances that destroy the ozone shield is to be phased out by 1996 under an international agreement. Among possible replacements for some uses, like fire extinguishers, are the fluorocarbons, which lack the chlorine atoms responsible for ozone destruction.</p>
        <p>But scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Aeronomy Laboratory in Boulder, Colo., report in the current issue of the journal Science that the fluorocarbons would remain in the atmosphere for up to 50,000 years in one case, while carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons remain in the air for decades rather than millennia.</p>
        <p>The good news is that although two forms of fluorocarbons are now emitted as byproducts of aluminum production, they are not yet present in the atmosphere in quantities to worry about. "At today's levels, it is not a significant greenhouse gas," said Dr. Susan Solomon, an author of the Science paper.</p>
