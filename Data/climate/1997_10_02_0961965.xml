        <p>IT'S crunch time at the White House on climate change policy. With the meeting on global warming set for Kyoto, Japan, in December, the Clinton Administration has less than three weeks to come up with its own proposal before the agenda is locked in place by meeting planners and America is reduced to the role of commentator.</p>
        <p>Cynics have assumed that President Clinton would stake out the easy high ground, demanding more from developing countries (or the United States Congress) than they are prepared to give, thereby obviating the need for action. But the Administration is reportedly trying to piece together a plan that rapidly growing economies like China could live with, yet still buy some insurance against climate change. That is why White House policy wonks are now focusing on hybrid plans that limit greenhouse gas emissions, yet provide an escape hatch.</p>
        <p>''The idea is to get started, but without fear of economic surprises,'' said Richard Morgenstern, a former Environmental Protection Agency official who is a researcher at Resources for the Future, a nonpartisan group in Washington.</p>
        <p>The European Community is officially gung-ho to set ambitious emissions goals for the developed world and to meet them with the help of carbon emission taxes. The Clinton Administration, by contrast, is reluctant to agree to any policy with teeth unless developing countries -- notably China, India and Russia -- join in. Administration economists are especially taken with emissions trading plans that would allow private businesses in developed countries to pay their counterparts in developing economies to do the heavy lifting.</p>
        <p>This opens two avenues for rationalizing doing nothing at all.</p>
        <p>The Administration could earn brownie points with hard-line environmentalists by going along with the Europeans, effectively inviting the Republican Congressional majority to shoot down any agreement. House Speaker Newt Gingrich has already warned against an accord in which ''the U.S. would likely bear too much burden.'' And Republicans would no doubt go to the barricades before approving a new tax on carbon emissions.</p>
        <p>Or President Clinton could insist that developing countries fully commit to both targets and means for limiting emissions before he presents the deal to Congress. This would seem statesmanlike while indefinitely delaying the need to ask sacrifice from Americans.</p>
        <p>The ease of procrastination explains the new interest in hybrid proposals from serious policy types in the Administration who want the President to take the lead in Kyoto.</p>
        <p>The idea is simple, says Mr. Morgenstern, who, in collaboration with Raymond Kopp and William Pizer at Resources for the Future, has outlined its virtues on the group's Web site (www.rff.org). The researchers would set limits on total carbon emissions and parcel out rights to emit that can be traded between businesses and perhaps countries. But they would also guarantee that no one would ever have to pay more than a ceiling price for permits in the private market -- say $10 a ton -- by having governments sell any number of additional permits at the ceiling.</p>
        <p>If the ceiling price were low enough, business might be willing to go along. Indeed, a few companies -- most notably British Petroleum, which announced a voluntary emissions monitoring program earlier this week in conjunction with the Environmental Defense Fund -- seem eager for modest actions that reduce business uncertainty. And since proposed charges for added permits aren't necessarily ''taxes'' in the Republican lexicon, they, too, might go with the flow.</p>
        <p>The concept is unappealing to environmental lobbies that want strict targets and timetables. But Mr. Morgenstern suggests that the hybrid approach would call the bluff of perennially optimistic enviros, who argue that there is a cheap fix for every problem. And it would please many economists, who want to set up a framework for efficient containment of greenhouse gases before the risks of climate change are fully understood. ''This would be a way to initiate a broad but realistic commitment,'' argued Robert Stavins of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.</p>
        <p>Warwick J. McKibbin and Peter J. Wilcoxen, authors of a climate change ''policy brief'' at the Brookings Institution (www.brook.edu), see other benefits. The price ceiling on permits could be set low enough, they suggest, to make it palatable for rich countries to begin containment without the cooperation of developing countries. Moreover, the chance to collect a fee on excess emissions would give revenue-hungry governments an incentive to enforce the standards.</p>
        <p>The hybrid approach is too new to allow for a realistic assessment of its chances at Kyoto. But it is appealing on its face. More important, its prominence in current Administration thinking suggests that the White House is treating sacrifices in containing climate change as a problem in political coalition-building rather than a potential obstacle to Al Gore's election in 2000. ''The real choice is not between a sharp reduction in emissions and a more modest policy,'' Mr. Wilcoxen said, ''but between a modest policy and no policy at all.''</p>
