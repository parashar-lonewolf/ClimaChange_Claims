        <p>Coal is so cheap and so widely available that its increased use is inevitable, but clearing the hurdle to burning it on a wide scale -- separating the carbon dioxide and sequestering it -- could turn out to be one of the great engineering challenges of the century, energy experts say.</p>

        <p>Coal is so cheap and so widely available that its increased use is inevitable, but clearing the hurdle to burning it on a wide scale -- separating the carbon dioxide and sequestering it -- could turn out to be one of the great engineering challenges of the century, energy experts say.</p>
        <p>There are at least a dozen proposals on Capitol Hill for sequestering all the carbon from coal burning, and the Senate Energy Committee began hearings last month on how to refocus research on the problem. It's a challenge that has captured the attention of engineers across the country who hope to perfect a clean-coal technology that could provide climate-friendly energy for hundreds of years at modest cost.</p>
        <p>''Coal has to be in our energy mix, because of its value for society and its importance to the country,'' said Mark Gray, vice president for engineering services at American Electric Power, which recently announced three projects to capture carbon. ''We have enough coal for anywhere from 200 to 450 years.''</p>
        <p>One of the first proposals likely to get a serious airing in Washington is a bill introduced by Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and Senator Pete V. Domenici, also of New Mexico, who is the committee's ranking Republican. They were joined in late March by five other senators in submitting the proposal, which aims to improve the Energy Department's ability to sponsor research in carbon capture and sequestration.</p>
        <p>Engineers are working on methods for capturing the carbon emitted when coal is burned. They have considered options as diverse as freezing the gases as they come out of smokestacks, and binding them to a liquid chemical after combustion. Two other possibilities are to modify the coal before it is burned, or to change the air it is burned with.</p>
        <p>Capturing the gas, though, is just one part of the equation. Finding a way to store it is likely to prove equally challenging. The leading possibility is old oil fields, where the carbon dioxide could be injected to force more oil to existing wells. But the total capacity of all the old oil fields in the world is much too small for this purpose. In addition, the oil fields are punctured by wells that could provide escape routes for the carbon dioxide to leak into.</p>
        <p>Work has also focused on getting a pure stream of carbon dioxide. That is a challenge because flue gases from a coal plant are only about 12 percent carbon dioxide, by weight. The mix is mostly nitrogen, since nitrogen makes up 78 percent of the air consumed during combustion.</p>
        <p>The energy agency is focused on a generating technology called Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle, or I.G.C.C. This technology uses generating stations to burn gas in a turbine, which powers a rotating shaft connected to a generator. Then the exhaust gases are used to boil water, which makes steam to turn a second turbine, to make more electricity. In the coal variant, the gas is created by cooking the coal, in a low-oxygen environment, into a gaseous mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen.</p>
        <p>Two such plants are operating in the United States and more are planned, but they do not separate their carbon. The Energy Department has a program for building I.G.C.C. plants that would separate their carbon.</p>
        <p>Under the program, called FutureGen, new I.G.C.C. plants would make the same gas from coal, but the carbon monoxide would react with steam to make carbon dioxide and more hydrogen. The hydrogen would go to the turbine, leaving the carbon dioxide to be sequestered.</p>
        <p>The agency's push toward finding places to build those plants and partners to do the work may not be moving as fast as the political momentum to limit carbon emissions, and FutureGen has won a nickname -- NeverGen -- from the utility executives who are wary of such partnerships.</p>
        <p>In addition, the technology cannot be retrofitted on traditional plants, called pulverized coal plants, and may even be hard to apply to existing I.G.C.C. plants that were not designed for capture.</p>
        <p>The private sector is chasing two other possible routes. One got a boost recently from American Electric Power, a coal-based utility that often sets technological trends. American Electric, with Babcock &amp; Wilcox, is testing a technology to feed the boiler with oxygen, not air, so that the flue gases are almost all carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>''You get a flame that mimics what you get with air,'' said Michael W. Rencheck, American Electric's senior vice president for engineering projects. A key question, though, is whether the energy required to strip the nitrogen out of the air is more or less than the energy required in other systems.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rencheck's company is trying out another technology, at the back end of the plant where the gases leave the furnace. American Electric's plan is to inject ammonia chilled to 37 to 45 degrees into the gases leaving the boiler, and let it absorb the carbon dioxide, and then heat the ammonia to about 88 degrees so it gives the carbon dioxide back for sequestration.</p>
        <p>An electric industry coalition has been testing the idea in a laboratory, and a small-scale test is scheduled for later this year at a coal-fired plant in Wisconsin. If American Electric can make it work on a portion of the flue gasses at a plant in West Virginia next year, it will install the process on a full-scale basis at another plant, in Oklahoma, which would represent the first full-scale demonstration.</p>
