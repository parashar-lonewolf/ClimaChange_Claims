        <p>THE mosquitoes are plotting their return. They are laying their eggs in salt marshes, in birdbaths, in untended garden pots and in backyard puddles. And in a matter of weeks, millions will hatch, take to the air and begin their hunt for blood.</p>
        <p>None of this would be cause for alarm except for last year's outbreak of West Nile encephalitis, a deadly virus spread by the bite of a mosquito.</p>
        <p>So officials across the Island have started to roll out their antimosquito measures (including chickens used as a kind of early warning system in Suffolk). The efforts have been expanded significantly since last year, when widespread spraying of pesticides angered environmentalists -- and homeowners who were caught outdoors when insecticides rained down.</p>
        <p>The virus killed seven people and caused brain infections in 62 others in the metropolitan region last year. Six Nassau residents contracted the disease, and one died. No humans fell ill Suffolk, but nine horses died and dead birds were found with the disease across the county.</p>
        <p>No one knows how widespread West Nile might be this year, but the virus has already been found in dormant adult mosquitoes in Queens and in a red-tailed hawk that died in Westchester in February.</p>
        <p>Officials in Nassau and Suffolk have said that pesticides would be sprayed only if absolutely necessary and stressed that they are combating mosquitoes in the larval stage to reduce spraying.</p>
        <p>Both counties have increased efforts to get homeowners to do their share by clearing their properties of stagnant water. State officials have helped coordinate efforts and will analyze hundreds of thousands of mosquitoes to determine how widespread the West Nile virus is.</p>
        <p>Suffolk County, which has long had an extensive mosquito-control program in its broad salt marshes, has expanded its staff for mosquito control and virus detection to 55 people, from 35. Perhaps its most innovative program -- the first in the region -- involves using six dozen chickens as bait. They will be set out in coops across the county so their blood can be drawn and checked every two weeks to test for the West Nile virus.</p>
        <p>''It's a very good means of surveillance,'' said Dr. Scott R. Campbell, the county entomologist and head of the county laboratory studying mosquito-borne diseases. ''The chickens will be out there seven days a week, as opposed to deploying mosquito traps in the same locations, which can only be done one day at a time.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Campbell said workers were still scouting sites for the coops, which will not be in place until early June. He said the chickens, even if bitten by a mosquito carrying the virus, would not die from the disease.</p>
        <p>Workers in both counties will begin setting out more traditional mosquito traps in a week or two. The traps, which use lights and carbon dioxide to attract the bugs, are usually set out before dusk and collected the next morning.</p>
        <p>The mosquitoes, which are alive when sucked into a bag, are sorted by species, frozen and sent to Albany for testing. More than 40 species of mosquito can be found on the Island, but so far only the common house mosquito has been found to carry the West Nile virus.</p>
        <p>Mosquitoes feed on the blood of birds and mammals and usually home in on their prey by searching for carbon dioxide emitted when the bird or mammal exhales.</p>
        <p>Gregory F. Terrillion, mosquito-control supervisor for Nassau, said the county would soon be sending samples from 40 traps every week to state officials for testing, up from 10 traps last year. Suffolk officials will send samples from 35 traps each week. Analysis of the mosquitoes will help officials determine whether pesticide is warranted, and how much.</p>
        <p>Also in the next week, Nassau and Suffolk will begin to seek mosquito larvae and start spreading larvicides, which generally are not opposed by environmentalists because they do not harm other life forms.</p>
        <p>Nassau County workers will monitor and apply larvicides to some 50 ponds, 200 miles of freshwater streams, 650 storm drains and 70,000 street basins. Suffolk officials plan to inspect 15,000 breeding sites and treat 25,000 acres with larvicides. They also plan to make sure water flows smoothly through wetlands by cleaning 750,000 feet of ditches.</p>
        <p>''We can't assure people yet that there won't be any spraying this year,'' said Dr. Clare B. Bradley, the Suffolk County Health Commissioner. ''Hopefully, prevention will work and we won't need to, but we'll have to take things one day at a time.''</p>
        <p>Nassau officials started distributing 80,000 pamphlets last week telling homeowners how they can curb mosquitoes, including such common-sense measures as removing all stagnant water around the house, keeping pools chlorinated, changing water in birdbaths every few days and keeping window screens in good shape.</p>
        <p>Suffolk officials noted that mosquito-surveillance efforts that were started when eastern equine encephalitis arrived in the county in the early 1990's helped to limit the amount of spraying last year. In 1996, when public parks were closed because of the threat of the encephalitis, pesticides were sprayed over 100,000 acres in the county. But last year, when the West Nile virus surfaced, mosquito trapping helped narrow the spraying area to less than 64,000 acres.</p>
        <p>Dr. Campbell said another factor promoting vigilance was the malaria that struck two 11-year-old boys last summer at the Baiting Hollow Boy Scout Camp in Calverton. Officials determined that a mosquito that had previously bitten someone who contracted the disease while traveling abroad must have bitten and infected the boys.</p>
        <p>''That was a disease we hadn't seen in decades,'' said Dr. Bradley, ''and made me realize that we could see anything new. We have to be prepared that there are other viruses that could make their way to this country.''</p>
        <p>Some environmentalists remain extremely critical, however, and say officials are still relying too much on pesticides.</p>
        <p>''There's no indication that either county plans to remove those toxic chemicals from use,'' said Bob DiBenedetto, chairman of EarthSave L.I./N.Y.C. ''We need to hear them say that they know that these chemicals are dangerous and they need to educate the public on this.''</p>
        <p>He noted that the primary pesticide, malathion, is being reviewed by the federal Environmental Protection Agency as a possible carcinogen. He also said assurances by officials that malathion breaks down quickly and is therefore harmless are unjustified because at least one byproduct, malaoxon, is more toxic than malathion. ''Studies have shown that this is a very dangerous chemical,'' he said of malaoxon, ''but they're not telling people this.''</p>
        <p>Still, other environmentalists are encouraged by the counties' efforts to educate the public and to attack the problem before mosquitoes become adults and can be eradicated only with pesticides.</p>
        <p>Dr. Basil Tangredi, a veterinarian and wildlife rehabilitater who will work with Suffolk County collecting the blood of chickens and other birds, is vehemently opposed to malathion.</p>
        <p>''But I'm encouraged that the county is not looking at that as a first line of defense and that they seem to be going in the direction of integrated pest management which is more environmentally sound,'' he said. ''While they're willing to go that route, I'm happy to work with them.''</p>
        <p>Marie J. Smith, co-director of the Sweetbriar Nature Center in Smithtown, also said that she opposed pesticides, but that she was glad officials were finally encouraging homeowners to rid their own properties of breeding grounds.</p>
        <p>''The education of the public is important so that people are not panicking, and are just doing basic stuff to take care of their own property,'' she said. ''It's really doing the things we should be doing anyway.''</p>
        <p>After all, she noted, the common house mosquito has a range of only about 200 feet. And it takes only about eight ounces of water, lying still for four or more days, to start a breeding factory that could eventually release hundreds of mosquitoes into the air.</p>
