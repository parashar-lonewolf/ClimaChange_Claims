        <p>LEAD: The environmental group Greenpeace sharply criticized a key United Nations conference on global warming today, saying plans to prevent climate change were inadequate.</p>
        <p>The environmental group Greenpeace sharply criticized a key United Nations conference on global warming today, saying plans to prevent climate change were inadequate.</p>
        <p>Greenpeace issued a statement on the first day of the four-day conference, asserting that the plans under discussion did not contain any concrete steps to prevent release of heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere. These ''greenhouse'' gases are expected to cause global warming, scientists say.</p>
        <p>About 300 delegates from 75 countries, including Britain, the United States and Japan, are attending the session hosted by Sweden in the central town of Sundsvall. Greenpeace has observer status at the conference.</p>
        <p>The meeting's aim is to lay the groundwork for a treaty on global warming to be adopted at the U.N. conference on environment and development in Brasilia in June 1992. The report being discussed is based on research by more than 1,000 atmospheric experts and has been issued by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It proposes that individual nations should attempt to limit or reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and says measures should also be taken to increase efficiency in energy production and energy use.</p>
        <p>''The panel has been used by a handful of industrial countries which think in short-term economics instead of planning for coming generations,'' Greenpeace said.</p>
