        <p>The leaders of eight industrial nations concluded their annual economic summit meeting in this island resort today with a broad commitment to help poor countries reduce their debt burden and increase their access to better education, health care and information technology.</p>
        <p>In a communique issued at the end of a three-day meeting in Okinawa, Japan's southernmost island, the leaders of the Group of 8 promised action on a wide variety of issues, most notably to curtail extreme poverty and the spread of infectious diseases like AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori of Japan, this year's host, said wealthy nations have an obligation to break the ''vicious cycle'' of poverty and disease faced by poor countries. In addition to Mr. Mori, the leaders of the United States, Canada, Britain, Italy, France, Germany and Russia took part in the conference.</p>
        <p>''We commit ourselves to the agreed international development goals, including the overarching objective of reducing the share of the world's population living in extreme poverty to half its 1990 levels by 2015,'' the leaders said in a statement.</p>
        <p>Seeking to bridge the so-called digital divide, a technological gap that separates the world's haves from the have-nots, the leaders agreed to establish a task force to help developing countries reap the benefits offered by new information technologies.</p>
        <p>The conference's final 15-page communique, drafts of which had been circulating for days, contained few new initiatives and provided few details on how the leading industrialized nations would achieve their lofty goals, bringing criticism from some human rights groups and nongovernmental organizations that the summit meeting had lacked substance.</p>
        <p>The statement did, however, mention the need for joint attention to a number of issues, including the safety of genetically modified foods, research into the human genome, cross-border criminal organizations, the aging of populations in many developed countries and environmental issues like global warming.</p>
        <p>The leaders promised to speed up efforts to achieve debt relief for 20 of the most heavily indebted poor countries. A similar pledge was made a year ago at the group's summit meeting in Cologne, Germany, but so far only nine of those impoverished countries have received some relief.</p>
        <p>The leaders at the meeting also pledged to jump-start the multilateral trade talks under the World Trade Organization before the end of the year. Last December, the trade organization's policy meeting in Seattle collapsed when officials failed to reach an agreement on the agenda and street demonstrations against globalization turned violent.</p>
        <p>The summit meetings are a chance for world leaders to make an impression, and in Okinawa President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia stole the show.</p>
        <p>Before coming to Okinawa, Mr. Putin visited the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, and there was widespread interest at the summit meeting in his trip.</p>
        <p>At a press briefing today, Mr. Putin said he believed that Mr. Kim was a man with whom the world could do business and urged more contacts with him to help to defuse tensions in the region.</p>
        <p>There were widespread fears that, as in Seattle, there would be disruptive demonstrations around the Okinawa meeting after Okinawan police officers arrested a United States marine accused of sexually molesting a 14-year-old island girl. The episode did lead to huge demonstrations by Okinawans, who have long demanded the removal of the many United States military bases on the island.</p>
        <p>But the protests, which were held at military bases and at hotels and conference centers used for the meeting, remained orderly, and the police reported no violence.</p>
        <p>In a private meeting with Prime Minister Mori, President Clinton apologized for a series of crimes, including sex attacks, committed here in recent years by United States servicemen.</p>
        <p>The Japanese government came under sharp criticism, though, for spending more than $750 million to hold this event.</p>
        <p>Nongovernmental organizations said that Japan's record expenditure  was nearly 100 times higher than the amounts spent at the meeting in Cologne or an earlier one in Birmingham, England, and that the money could have been used to relieve the debt of the world's poorest nations.</p>
        <p>Jubilee 2000, a protest group that seeks to reduce the debt of developing countries, said the amount that Japan spent on the meeting could have been used to erase the debt of Gambia or Equatorial Guinea. ''The world's leaders have retreated to this remote island of Okinawa and have turned their backs on the poor,'' the group said.</p>
        <p>The Japanese government said that the $750 million included the cost of staging the three-day meeting in Okinawa and earlier meetings of finance ministers and foreign ministers in Fukuoka and Miyazaki. About $300 million of the $750 million was spent on security, which included 22,000 police officers drafted from across the country to work at the meeting.</p>
        <p>It has been nearly a quarter-century since the first summit meeting of the world's major industrialized countries was held -- in Rambouillet, France, in 1975.</p>
        <p>The meetings were initially intended as informal gatherings where the leaders of the world's richest countries could resolve problems of common concern, like inflation, economic growth and currency crises. The premise was that they could do more together than separately.</p>
        <p>But the conferences have evolved in recent years to include discussions of broader political and social significance, including armed conflicts, technology, hunger, health care and other issues affecting the developing world, and to include Russia, which, despite its ailing economy, is a central figure on the world stage.</p>
        <p>In his briefing today, Mr. Putin also said he would continue lobbying Washington to abandon plans to build an antimissile defense shield against possible attack from hostile countries like North Korea.</p>
        <p>''Putin conducted himself like a true statesman, unlike his predecessor, Yeltsin, who acted erratic and was probably drunk at previous summits,'' said George von Furstenberg, a professor in economic and financial policy at Fordham University in New York.</p>
        <p>''Putin didn't come here looking sad with his hand out begging for loans,'' the professor said. ''He was confident and mature and had a bag of North Korean goodies to share with the group.''</p>
