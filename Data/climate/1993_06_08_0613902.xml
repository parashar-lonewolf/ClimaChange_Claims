        <p>FOR years, scientists concerned about the environmental effects of burning fossil fuels have tried to balance the global carbon budget. Now Harvard University researchers have found that temperate-zone forests may play a more important role in absorbing atmospheric carbon dioxide, a key greenhouse gas given off by burning, than was previously believed.</p>
        <p>Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are believed to trap heat, possibly leading to global warming.</p>
        <p>Dr. Steven C. Wofsy, a chemist and senior research fellow at Harvard University, led a research team that found a greater-than-expected net exchange of carbon dioxide between the atmosphere and the soil and vegetation of Harvard Forest, a middle-aged deciduous forest in Petersham, Mass. The study was reported in the May 28 issue of the journal Science.</p>
        <p>The trees of the forest, mostly oak and maple, are 50 to 70 years old, said Dr. Wofsy, adding that the forest was chosen for study because it was relatively isolated and because its recent history was well documented. The land was used for agriculture throughout the 1800's and was later reforested. A hurricane in 1938 leveled most of the forest, Dr. Wofsy said.</p>
        <p>"A good healthy oak tree will live 110 or 120 years, so if you had a forest stand that was much older than that, you wouldn't see a lot of net growth," Dr. Wofsy said. "You expect a forest like this that has been blown down or cut over to be growing, so you're not surprised when you go out and make the measurements that we made and find that it's taking up carbon. We were surprised at how much it was taking up."</p>
        <p>For two years, the Harvard researchers continuously measured the amount of carbon dioxide present above the treetops and monitored the change in the carbon dioxide concentration from the forest floor up through the canopy. From these measurements, the researchers determined that the forest ecosystem absorbed about 3,500 pounds of carbon per acre each year.</p>
        <p>"During the summer, the trees will take up carbon and they will put some into wood and some into leaves and twigs," Dr. Wofsy explained. "During the winter they're not doing that anymore. The leaves have fallen and they are decaying, and so it is the decay of the forest litter that is providing carbon back to the atmosphere."</p>
        <p>Dr. Wofsy said the carbon accumulation witnessed in Harvard Forest was about one-third greater than the rate assumed in models of temperate-zone forests used to study global carbon exchange. Those models of regenerating temperate-zone forests assumed a yearly carbon accumulation of about 2,200 pounds an acre for 50 years after a disturbance like a timber harvest, and a near-zero accumulation for longer periods, he said.</p>
        <p>"If you look at the way people have tried to balance the books globally on carbon," he said, "they have been using much lower numbers for how much a forest like this might take up."</p>
        <p>Dr. Jeff Amthor, a plant ecophysiologist at the Woods Hole Research Center in Woods Hole, Mass., said previous estimates of carbon accumulation in forests were based on harvesting of small numbers of trees. Those results were then adjusted for use in a global model. The process of estimation made the models less reliable, he said.</p>
        <p>"What Steve Wofsy is doing is circumventing most of the major problems encountered in earlier studies and getting at a real measure of the carbon dioxide flux right above the forest," Dr. Amthor said. "The eddy correlation techniques are the only way that we can get at exchanges of carbon between large ecosystems and the atmosphere."</p>
        <p>The soil releases carbon into the atmosphere continuously, Dr. Wofsy said, but during the growing season the forest absorbs far more carbon than is released, resulting in a net storage of carbon.</p>
        <p>"One of the things that this study does pretty effectively is demonstrate that these forests can really take up an awful lot of carbon under the right conditions," said Dr. Wofsy. "How prevalent those conditions are or what we might do in the future to have a significant impact on global carbon is not really quite clear."</p>
