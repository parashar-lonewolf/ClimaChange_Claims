        <p>After two years of struggle over what to do about global warming, the Clinton Administration and the developing countries in the global game of greenhouse politics have put their cards on the table, and negotiations have at last begun in earnest.</p>
        <p>The talks ''have come alight, and not a moment too soon,'' said Michael Zammit Cutajar of Malta, the executive secretary of the United Nations body that administers the 1992 treaty on climate change.</p>
        <p>Delegates from 150 countries are gathered here to discuss possible revisions to the treaty, in the last of eight negotiating sessions leading up to a final session in Kyoto, Japan, in December.</p>
        <p>The American plan, announced today by President Clinton in Washington, represents the low-ball bid. Mr. Clinton called for stabilizing industrialized countries' emissions of heat-trapping gases at 1990 levels by about 2010, with a modest reduction below 1990 levels by about 2020.</p>
        <p>A sharply contrasting proposal, presented formally today by the developing countries and China, calls for the rich countries to cut their emissions by 7.5 percent below 1990 levels by 2005, 15 percent by 2010 and 35 percent by 2020.</p>
        <p>An agreement in Kyoto, should one be reached, apparently lies somewhere between the two boundaries set by the United States and the Group of 77 Plus China, as the developing countries call themselves.</p>
        <p>With today's announcements, the negotiating ''universe'' has been firmly delineated for the first time.</p>
        <p>Under the 1992 treaty, the developing countries are explicitly exempted from undertaking any specific commitments, and they have steadfastly maintained that they will not agree to do so unless the rich nations demonstrate convincingly that they are serious about taking the lead. The rationale is that since the industrialized countries are the biggest emitters of the gases and got rich by emitting them, they should take the first steps toward reduction.</p>
        <p>While agreeing that the developed countries should take the lead, President Clinton reasserted today the United States position that the poorer countries must be part of any negotiated solution.</p>
        <p>The poorer countries' emissions are expected to exceed those of the developed world within two or three decades. Two of the largest of them, China and India, have abundant reserves of coal, the most troublesome fossil fuel in terms of emitting heat-trapping, or greenhouse, gases. Global warming occurs when such gases, chiefly carbon dioxide, accumulate in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is produced by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, the energy underpinnings of the global economy.</p>
        <p>But the United States is the world's major producer of greenhouse gases, and the American proposal has been deemed critical for the success of the talks. For two days, the delegates gathering at the Beethoven Halle opera house on the Rhine have been anxiously awaiting the American proposal.</p>
        <p>As details began filtering out of Washington, some reactions were predictable. An important delegate from the European Union, which favors a 15 percent reduction in emissions by 2010, said he ''looked at the figures, and. . . .'' He made a dismissive gesture.</p>
        <p>But some industry representatives considered the proposal quite ambitious. ''This will be a tremendous cut,'' said Gail McDonald, president of the Global Climate Coalition, an  industry group in Washington. ''It's a very aggressive target.''</p>
        <p>To Raul Estrada-Oyuela of Argentina, the chairman of the Bonn talks, the Clinton proposal was ''really modest; we were waiting for a bigger effort.'' But, he said tonight after watching Mr. Clinton's speech outlining the proposals, ''it's encouraging that the President of the United States takes the issue so seriously.''</p>
        <p>To some delegates, the American proposal looked puny because the 1992 treaty already obligates rich countries to aim at capping emissions at 1990 levels in 2000. Instead, United States emissions in 2000 are expected to be 13 percent higher than they were in 1990. Some European Union officials say the Europeans as a group will meet the goal.</p>
        <p>''It seems to me that the United States proposal is even less'' than what was originally contained in the treaty, since it would delay the 1990 stabilization goal by 10 years, said Dr. Mark Mwandosya of Tanzania, the chairman of the developing country caucus in the talks.</p>
        <p>But there is another way of looking at what the American proposal would mean. Even before its features were known, Mr. Zammit Cutajar had pointed out that 1990 was not a magic number. The way to measure a proposal, he said, is by gauging what it would actually mean in emissions terms. By that standard, the  United States would reduce its emissions about 25 percent from where it would otherwise be around 2010, the Administration said.</p>
        <p>''It would be, admittedly,'' said Dr. Mwandosya, especially since the United States is the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world. ''But is it enough to pull the rest of the world toward stabilization of concentrations? I don't think it is.'' Others noted that the United States target and timetable would require countries already below or approaching 1990 levels to do little or nothing.</p>
        <p>Everyone agrees that it will eventually be necessary to reduce emissions well below 1990 levels if concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are to be stabilized. This is because 1990 levels were already too high; the overall concentration of gases in the atmosphere keeps going up at that level of emissions.</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 27, 1997, Monday</p>
        <p>A listing on Thursday of proposals to limit emissions of gases that cause global warming misstated the one offered by Japan. It would cut yearly average emissions from 2008 to 2012 by 5 percent below 1990 levels, not return them to 1990 levels.</p>
