        <p>LEAD: In 1791, Vermont patriots gathered here, voting to join the union as the 14th state.

        <p>In 1791, Vermont patriots gathered here, voting to join the union as the 14th state. Almost two centuries later, in a pristine clapboard church a few yards from the site where that historic decision was made, an assembly of Vermonters voted by a 2-to-1 margin to secede from the United States.</p>
        <p>The nonbinding vote today came at the end of a debate on secession sponsored by the Vermont Statehood Bicentennial Commission. It was the first of six debates being held this month as part of the state's anniversary celebration.</p>
        <p>''We thought there was no better way to get people to focus on statehood than to discuss secession,'' said the commission's director, Carolyn Crowley Meub.</p>
        <p>But while Ms. Meub describes the debate as ''half whimsical,'' at least one debater, Frank Bryan, a professor of political science at the University of Vermont in Burlington, appeared to be in earnest.</p>
        <p>''Vermont is America's conscience,'' Dr. Bryan told the audience of nearly 200 people who gathered at the First Congregational Church 199 years to the day after Vermont was admitted to the union. Many applauded as he denounced the impersonal ''mega- , macro-bureaucracy'' that he said the Federal Government had become. He said that secession would be a ''sharp slap on the cheek'' to the rest of the country, and that ''a century hence, America will say 'thanks, I needed that.' ''</p>
        <p>His remarks were variations on a theme he embraced three years ago with the publication of ''Out! The Vermont Secession Book,'' a humorous tract. ''Pogo was wrong,'' Dr. Bryan and his co-author, Bill Mares, wrote. ''We have met the enemy and he is not us. The enemy is you guys, and we're leaving.''</p>
        <p>''America has given up on democracy,'' the authors continued. ''We haven't. We tried to tell you a thousand times. But you wouldn't listen. Well maybe you'll pay attention to this: Get lost!''</p>
        <p>The task of supporting the union in the debate fell to John Dooley, an Associate Justice of the Vermont Supreme Court. Secession, he said, would be the ''easy way out,'' the kind of solution the American journalist H. L. Mencken would have called ''neat, simple - and wrong.''</p>
        <p>Judge Dooley argued that the United States would erect trade barriers against a nation of Vermont. He said the state's personal, low-key government would become just as bureacratic as the Federal Government to cope with complexities like taxation, economic policies, human service needs and environmental pollution. Vermont needs the union, he said, adding, ''A cute little government will not stop acid rain.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Bryan countered that ''all those Americans who like eating Ben &amp; Jerry's'' ice cream, made in Vermont, would not stand for trade sanctions.</p>
        <p>The idea of secession is not new to Vermont. The State Archivist, Gregory Sanford, says the most frequently asked question concerning the state's constitution is from angry Vermonters who are convinced that there is an ''escape clause'' providing for secession, and who demand to see it. There is none.</p>
        <p>''I think in the end that people seeking secession are seeking escape, rather than solutions, to the problems in our society,'' Mr. Sanford said.</p>
        <p>But the idea appears to be gaining some popular support. On a recent call-in program on Vermont Public Radio, the vote was 20 to 1 in favor of secession.</p>
        <p>''There is a sense out there that the Federal Government is out of control and that we can handle things better here,'' said Rod Clarke, the producer and host of the program.</p>
        <p>''Vermont is small, and we don't have much of an impact in Washington, but we have great ideas,'' said Mary Ann Pembroke of Bennington, who, with her husband, Richard, a State Representative, voted for secession after the debate today. ''This might make Washington take notice of how we really feel.'' The majority of the 164 audience members who voted on the issue agreed, casting 99 votes for secession.</p>
        <p>Lieut. Gov. Howard Dean, who moderated the debate, called the event ''good history, good politics and good theater.''</p>
        <p>But Dr. Bryan has dreams of something more:</p>
        <p>''You know what I hope? I hope that the Bicentennial Commission has opened a Pandora's Box. I hope that a few months from now, they'll have occasion to say: 'Wow! We had no idea what we were doing!' ''</p>
