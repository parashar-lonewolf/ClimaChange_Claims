        <p>A multibillion-dollar aid package to help save the developing world's environmental resources took shape here today as national leaders began to arrive for the Earth Summit's concluding phase.</p>
        <p>After working through the night, negotiators were said to have agreed on almost all aspects of an ambitious package of measures to promote environmentally sustainable development in the poorer south, but officials said the United States contribution was likely to be small.</p>
        <p>Negotiators still struggled to resolve their differences over the aid that the wealthier industrial nations of the North would offer the poor nations of the South to offset the extra cost that the latter face for safeguarding the environment and preserving disappearing forests. Talks Through the Weekend</p>
        <p>As a result of the standoff, the Earth Summit's chief organizer, Maurice Strong of Canada, announced today that negotiations would continue into the weekend so President Bush and other leaders can help shape the final compromise.</p>
        <p>"Involving the heads of state and government personally will give us a better result," Mr. Strong told a news conference today. "By Sunday we hope they will have produced a full agreement for approval by the summit's final plenary session."</p>
        <p>But diplomats said the decision to involve heads of state and government in the final talks reflected the intractable difficulties that had arisen and that could now be resolved only by compromises at the highest political level.</p>
        <p>As their price for agreeing to Agenda 21, the plan for making economic development environmentally sustainable, developing countries want the industrialized world to meet a 20-year-old commitment to raise its aid to seven-tenths of 1 percent of economic output by 2000, from four-tenths of 1 percent at present. How Much Is Wanted</p>
        <p>They also want donors to enlarge the size of the $1.3 billion Global Environmental Facility that they set up three years ago in the World Bank and to add a special "earth increment" to the World Bank agency that supplies loans on easier terms so it can provide virtually free environmental aid to the very poorest nations.</p>
        <p>The United States, which has contributed $50 million to the Global Environmental Facility so far, is prepared to consider an increase and is ready to study an "earth increment," officials say. Washington is also offering $150 million in new aid to help developing countries safeguard their forests.</p>
        <p>But today the Deputy Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, Michael Young, reiterated Washington's long-standing refusal to accept any target for its overall aid, arguing that such targets do not reflect the developing world's ability to absorb the money. He also said such loan commitments absolve poor countries from the need to attract foreign investment.</p>
        <p>Instead, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, William K. Reilly, presented a plan to carry out quickly a new convention curbing emission of the so-called greenhouse gases; most of the plan had already been announced.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly also said President Bush would propose a global inventory of biological resources when he addresses the Earth Summit on Friday.</p>
        <p>European and other Western countries, which have all accepted in principle the aid target of seven-tenths of 1 percent, are now trying to convince leaders in the developing world that donors will increase environmental aid to secure an agreement here -- even if many will not commit themselves to reach that figure by a particular date.</p>
        <p>Several delegations have already indicated that their leaders may present new aid offers when they address the Earth Summit. As a result, developing countries say they are waiting to see just what is offered.</p>
        <p>"We want to see what they come up with, so the negotiations will go on for another day or two," said Jamsheed A. Marker, Pakistan's Ambassador to the United Nations, who is also spokesman for the Group of 77, as the developing countries call themselves. An Offer From Japan</p>
        <p>Japanese officials have said Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa plans to announce an increase in the amount of environmental aid that Japan offers to developing countries to $1.4 billion a year over the next five years, from about $800 million a year between 1989 and 1991 .</p>
        <p>But in order not to embarrass President Bush, these officials say, Mr. Miyazawa will probably delay announcing plans to raise Japan's total development aid to $70 billion during the coming five years, from $50 billion over the last five years. The announcement could come in early July at the Munich summit meeting of the seven major industrial democracies.</p>
        <p>The 12 members of the European Community are also putting together a $4.3 billion package of environmental aid projects, which they plan to present at the final sessions.</p>
        <p>While the package will include both existing projects and some new money, European diplomats hope it will encourage developing countries to compromise on their demands. Forest Talks Also Blocked</p>
        <p>The continuing standoff over money has contributed to the stalemate between North and South over steps to preserve the world's forests.</p>
        <p>Tonight a senior United States official said Washington had virtually abandoned its hopes of securing a firm commitment to negotiate a binding international convention to safeguard forests.</p>
        <p>"We are not going to get a convention," the official said. "It's too much of an article of faith for the Group of 77.</p>
        <p>But Malaysia, which has opposed even a nonbinding set of forestry principles, was reported by delegates to be adopting a more flexible stand, and Brazil, which has the world's largest forests, was said to be anxious to promote a compromise to assure success at the meetings to which it has played host.</p>
        <p>Thus, diplomats said, India has emerged as the developing country most opposed to any move by the Earth Summit that might imply international control of the world's remaining forests.</p>
