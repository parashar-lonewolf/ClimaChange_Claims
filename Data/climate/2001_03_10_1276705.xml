        <p>The Bush administration, some influential Republicans in Congress and several big owners of coal-burning power plants have joined in advocating something long sought by environmental groups and Democrats: cuts in the plants' emissions of carbon dioxide, a heat-trapping greenhouse gas widely thought to contribute to a global warming trend.</p>
        <p>The cuts would come as part of a larger bill controlling carbon dioxide and three other emissions from the power plants: sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain; nitrogen oxides, which contribute to smog; and mercury, a toxic heavy metal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush promised in his campaign last fall to seek such a bill, and Christie Whitman, the new administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, has reasserted that pledge in recent days.</p>
        <p>Cuts would constitute the nation's first restrictions on carbon dioxide, a gas that has no direct effect on human health -- in fact, it is the bubbles in beer -- but that many scientists have concluded is already altering ecosystems and weather patterns as it accumulates in the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>But the prospect has spawned a fierce lobbying effort by conservative Republicans and some coal, oil and industry groups, which are urging Mr. Bush to abandon his campaign stance and any mention of carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>The opponents say laws requiring carbon dioxide cuts would harm the economy and clash with the administration's goal of raising supplies of fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>''This is a colossal mistake,'' said Myron Ebell, director of global warming policy for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a Washington group that advocates free markets and limited regulation and has attacked the administration recently. ''If they persist, there will be war.''</p>
        <p>Still, many people on both sides of the issue say chances have never been better for legislation to limit the emissions from power plants, which produce about 40 percent of the nation's carbon dioxide output.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's commitment on carbon dioxide -- articulated in a couple of short sentences deep in an energy policy paper released on Sept. 29 -- was a sharp shift for a politician who had long avoided making definitive statements on the seriousness of global warming.</p>
        <p>The change went largely unnoticed in the campaign, but has now bubbled up like a suddenly opened bottle of warm seltzer because of a confluence of recent events.</p>
        <p>First, several Republicans in important positions in Congress are preparing to propose power-plant legislation that would limit carbon dioxide, most significantly Senator Bob Smith, a New Hampshire Republican who is chairman of the Senate Environment Committee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith and other proponents of the bill say the bill is needed to simplify life for utilities facing a growing, unpredictable maze of federal and state laws governing all manner of emissions.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the energy task force, headed by Vice President Dick Cheney, is rushing to complete its initial plan for turning Mr. Bush's promises on energy and the environment into programs.</p>
        <p>And legislatures in many states where air pollution is an issue -- including New Hampshire, Ohio, Wisconsin and Michigan -- are moving toward passage of bills that limit the four emissions. Growing numbers of power-plant operators now regard as inevitable some sort of restrictions, and would prefer one federal standard to a patchwork of confusing regulations.</p>
        <p>Some environmental advocates, Democrats and moderate Republicans say that Mr. Bush's support for a comprehensive bill could provide crucial momentum. Past efforts foundered because of the political divide between the Clinton administration and Congress.</p>
        <p>''Having George W. Bush seriously looking at carbon dioxide as part of a four-pollutant approach on power plants really demonstrates that you can't ignore CO2  any more,'' said Jennifer L. Morgan, climate policy director for one conservation group, the World Wildlife Fund.</p>
        <p>Opponents of the legislation include coal and oil companies, business groups, and conservatives in Congress who doubt that climate change poses a significant threat and fear that restrictions on utilities would be costly -- and would eventually be applied to other carbon dioxide sources, notably cars and trucks.</p>
        <p>More than half the nation's electricity is produced by burning coal, which generates the most carbon dioxide per watt of any fuel. So any restrictions on carbon dioxide would probably lead to a shift toward other options, like natural gas, and would inevitably have some economic impact, though estimates range widely.</p>
        <p>Some conservatives also fear that any greenhouse-gas limits would signal that the Bush administration is planning to complete the Kyoto Protocol, a treaty negotiated under the Clinton administration that would commit the United States and 37 other industrialized countries to larger cuts in greenhouse gases. The treaty has not yet been ratified by any industrialized country.</p>
        <p>Negotiations about vital details broke down in November and are scheduled to resume in July. During the campaign, Mr. Bush criticized the treaty, saying that it would harm the economy by raising fuel prices and that it unfairly excluded large developing countries like China and India from obligations to reduce their gas releases.</p>
        <p>A task force within the administration is reviewing its stance on the treaty and other climate issues. But last week, Mrs. Whitman told a gathering of environment ministers from the Group of 8 -- the leading economic powers and Russia -- that the review ''does not represent a backing away from Kyoto.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps the strongest proponent of controlling greenhouse gases within the administration is Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill. As chairman of Alcoa, he spoke forcefully of the threat posed by the atmosphere's carbon dioxide levels, which have risen 25 percent since the late 1800's. ''There is no doubt about this issue,'' he said in a 1998 speech.</p>
        <p>Despite the intensifying effort to sway Mr. Bush from the power-plant bill, supporters of the legislation say that if it is written the right way it can eventually be passed with the president's support.</p>
        <p>They point to the unequivocal language used in Mr. Bush's Sept. 29 position paper, which stated that he would seek legislation that would ''establish mandatory reduction targets for emissions of four main pollutants: sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury and carbon dioxide.''</p>
        <p>Not only that, proponents say, the same paper promoted the difference between his mandatory cuts and the proposal of his rival. ''Vice President Gore has advocated only a voluntary program,'' Mr. Bush said.</p>
        <p>One impediment to a bill is a sharp battle line drawn by some in industry against language that would label carbon dioxide as pollution. That classification would bring it under the umbrella of the Clean Air Act.</p>
        <p>But a bill could be written that controls the gas while stating it is not a ''pollutant,'' according to William F. Tyndall, vice president for environmental services and federal affairs at the Cinergy Corporation, a power company based in Cincinnati that has a fleet of coal-fired plants around the Midwest but supports a comprehensive plant cleanup.</p>
        <p>''We've been promoting this idea and see it as an elegant solution to a very difficult situation,'' Mr. Tyndall said. ''I think it has a real shot.''</p>
        <p>Cinergy, American Electric Power -- a huge coal-dependent midwestern power company -- and some other utilities say they would accede to the limits in the expectation that the bill would provide flexibility. That could come in the form of allowing utilities to trade emissions credits earned by reducing emissions or planting forests, which sop up carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and store the carbon in wood and soil.</p>
        <p>Just as important, Mr. Tyndall said, such a bill would eliminate uncertainty about future regulation, making it much easier for a company to decide which of its existing power plants to improve, which to shift to cleaner fuels like natural gas, and which to shut down.</p>
        <p>For the moment, the White House is giving no signal about whether it will stick with the campaign position, with the first glimpse of its policy likely to come when Mr. Cheney's task force provides its initial findings on how to restore the country's energy balance. That report could be completed later this month.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, opponents have built up their pressure, most visibly in sharp attacks on Mrs. Whitman for reaffirming in recent statements Mr. Bush's pledge to include carbon dioxide in a cleanup of power plants.</p>
        <p>One e-mail message distributed recently to Congress, reporters and a list of conservatives by the Greening Earth Society, a group financed by coal-based utilities, described Mrs. Whitman as Christine Todd Browner -- an allusion to Carol M. Browner, the E.P.A. administrator under President Clinton.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, though, officials at the White House and E.P.A. said that Mrs. Whitman had not been pressured to change her remarks, though  she was apparently nudged gently to tone things down.</p>
        <p>''They are backing her up,'' said an E.P.A. official, referring to White House officials. ''No one is telling her not to speak. Everything she said was in his campaign message. They're just saying let's have some caution in the public statements until we are finished with this review.''</p>
