        <p>VALUE OF 'FOR SALE BY OWNER' -- Two Northwestern University economists who studied home-sales data from 1998 to 2004 in Madison, Wis., found that people who sold their homes through real estate agents typically did not get a higher sale price than people who sold their homes themselves. [Page A1.]</p>
        <p>RISE OF PORK PRICES WORRIES CHINA -- China is feeling the pinch of inflation and, as a result, Chinese companies are starting to raise prices for exports, removing what has been a brake on inflation in the West. For Chinese households, the rising prices are seen most dramatically in a critical commodity: pork. [C1.]</p>
        <p>INFLATION FEARS PULL DOWN SHARES -- Share prices posted their steepest three-day decline since markets dropped around the world in February, and the interest rate on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose above 5 percent for the first time since last summer, as fears about inflation, driving by a strong global economy, preoccupied investors. [C1.]</p>
        <p>NINTENDO NOW PLAYS WITH OTHERS -- Nintendo is known for turning out hits with memorable characters like Donkey Kong, left, and the Super Mario Bros., but it had a reputation for cold-shouldering game software developers, preferring to make its own hardware and software. But the secretive company is coming out of its shell. Along with its successful Wii game console, Nintendo has made a concerted effort to woo other game makers as part of a broader change in strategy to dominate the newest generation of consoles. [C1.]</p>
        <p>PATENT RULING AGAINST QUALCOMM -- Millions of cellphones containing certain Qualcomm semiconductors may not be imported into the United States, a federal government agency ruled in a patent dispute. [C1.]</p>
        <p>U.S. TO CONSIDER CLIMATE PLAN -- The United States agreed to ''consider seriously'' a European plan to combat global warming by cutting in half worldwide greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, averting a trans-Atlantic deadlock at a meeting in Germany of the world's richest industrial nations. [A10.]</p>
        <p>VODAFONE HEARS FROM INVESTORS -- The Vodafone Group, the world's largest cellphone company, said that it had received a letter from a group of shareholders asking it to return as much as £38 billion ($75 billion) to investors in part by spinning off its stake in Verizon Wireless. The letter is the latest effort by minority shareholders to influence management decisions. [C7.]</p>
        <p>MEXICO MEDIA LAW OVERTURNED -- Mexico's Supreme Court overwhelmingly voted to declare parts of a new media law unconstitutional, a blow to the country's two main broadcasters. The decision confirmed several preliminary votes that the court's members have taken over the past two weeks. [C2.]</p>
        <p>EQUAL AND SPLENDA IN NEW RIFT -- An undisclosed settlement between the makers of Equal and Splenda over Splenda's contested slogan of ''made like sugar, so its tastes like sugar'' came apart, prompting a renewed dispute between the two rival makers of artificial sweeteners. [C3.]</p>
        <p>A HESITANT RETURN TO SHOPPING -- Americans shopped hesitantly in May, giving retailers some relief from a dismal showing in April but still raising questions about how strong consumer spending would be in the months ahead. As the nation's merchants reported results, the disappointments included Wal-Mart Stores, Macy's and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. Costco Wholesale, Kohl's and luxury retailers like Saks beat expectations. ''It wasn't a blowout, but the gains were a solid snap back,'' said an analyst. [C3.]</p>
        <p>BIOMET BOARD ACCEPTS HIGHER BID -- A group of private equity firms bidding for Biomet, a maker of artificial joints, sweetened its offer to $11.4 billion after a prominent shareholder adviser criticized its previous bid as too low, and the new offer was accepted by the company's board. [C3.]</p>
        <p>FEWER SEEK JOBLESS BENEFITS -- Fewer workers signed up for unemployment benefits last week, and inventories at wholesalers picked up in April. [C2.]</p>
        <p>HAVE CELLPHONE, WILL CRITIQUE -- A leading cellphone maker is taking advantage of the popularity of blogs and other forms of consumer-generated content -- as well as the increasing interest in mobile marketing -- by offering music fans ages 18 and up a chance to play music critic for the summer. Advertising: Stuart Elliott. [C5.]</p>
        <p>DOW JONES'S NEW SEVERANCE PLANS -- Dow Jones &amp; Company, which is considering a $5 billion takeover deal by Rupert Murdoch, has amended its compensation plans so that 160 senior managers could take sizable severance payments with them if they were forced out after a sale. [C3.]</p>
        <p>PAYMENTS BY BRITISH ARMS MAKER -- A major British arms contractor, BAE, paid more than $2 billion clandestinely into bank accounts in Washington controlled by Prince Bandar bin Sultan of Saudi Arabia, two British news organizations reported. Prince Bandar denied accepting ''improper secret commissions.'' [A3.]</p>
        <p>PROMOTING A 'WALL STREET WEST' -- Hoping to capitalize on fears of the chaos another terrorist attack might cause in New York's financial industry, Pennsylvania officials are promoting a hilly corner of their state as Wall Street West. [B1.]</p>
        <p>LINKING SMALL LAW FIRMS -- A way to connect small law firms around the country and the world, and provide help in competing against the big national and global firms, is the idea behind the International Network of Boutique Law Firms. [C6.]</p>
        <p>CATERING TO WEALTHY CUSTOMERS -- The Wachovia Corporation said that it planned to more than double its private banking group over the next three years, in an effort to add wealthy customers as the nation grows more affluent. [C3.]</p>
