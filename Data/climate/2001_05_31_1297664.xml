        <p>EVEN in these technologically enlightened times, most laptops fall into one of two equally compromised categories. First, there's the full-size laptop, which offers most standard PC features but begins to weigh as much as a small Steinway by the time you reach Concourse Z.</p>
        <p>Second, there's the ultralight laptop. Although they weigh only two or three pounds, these models relegate critical components like the CD-ROM drive to a detachable docking station. Unfortunately, without a CD drive, you can't install new programs or resuscitate a dead machine on the road, so many people wind up lugging along the docking stations -- piano-moving time all over again. At this rate, we'll soon see ads for a one-pound laptop that's nothing but a keyboard; the rest will be a ''docking station.''</p>

        <p>EVEN in these technologically enlightened times, most laptops fall into one of two equally compromised categories. First, there's the full-size laptop, which offers most standard PC features but begins to weigh as much as a small Steinway by the time you reach Concourse Z.</p>
        <p>Second, there's the ultralight laptop. Although they weigh only two or three pounds, these models relegate critical components like the CD-ROM drive to a detachable docking station. Unfortunately, without a CD drive, you can't install new programs or resuscitate a dead machine on the road, so many people wind up lugging along the docking stations -- piano-moving time all over again. At this rate, we'll soon see ads for a one-pound laptop that's nothing but a keyboard; the rest will be a ''docking station.''</p>
        <p>The obvious solution -- a light, slim laptop that still has a built-in CD drive -- is the Bigfoot of personal computing: rumored to exist, but rarely spotted. I interrogated all the usual suspects, including Dell, Compaq, Gateway, Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M., Sony and Toshiba, seeking machines lighter than five pounds, no more than a foot wide, and equipped with a built-in CD drive. None of those companies make such a machine. (Dell and Compaq offer 12.5-inch wide units -- close, but no cigar.)</p>
        <p>Eventually, I unearthed portables from Apple, Fujitsu, NEC and WinBook that seem to offer everything. Like ultralights, they have shiny good looks (black plastic, begone!) and the svelte dimensions -- about 11 inches by 9 inches and one inch thick -- that will earn the respectful looks of your airplane seatmates.</p>
        <p>The small size means usability even on airplane tray tables. Even so, these machines come with almost everything you need built in: except where noted, each comes with modem, Ethernet, brilliant 12.1-inch screen (1024 by 768 pixels), a 20-gigabyte hard drive, 128 megabytes of RAM, tiny stereo speakers, a full-size keyboard, U.S.B. jacks, a video-out jack for projectors and, of course, a CD-ROM drive.</p>
        <p>You can order these machines in various configurations. Because they lack built-in diskette drives, ordering yours with a CD-RW drive is an excellent idea so you can copy your files onto blank CD's for backups and distribution. Three of these laptops even offer a superb new combination CD-RW/DVD drive, which both burns CD's and lets you watch movies.</p>
        <p>At only 4.1 pounds with the combination drive, the sleek, beautiful new NEC Versa TXi is the lightest laptop reviewed here. Its distinctive features include a 750-megahertz processor, three U.S.B. ports and a bay that, when you're not using CD's, can hold a second battery or a hollow weight-saving module. You can also make the NEC logo on the lid blink in your choice of seven vivid colors, either to notify you of new e-mail or just to be gaudy. On such an otherwise refined machine, discovering that weird feature is like finding a jelly bean in your caviar.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, you pay dearly for this machine, both in dollars (a hair-straightening $3,300 for the combination-drive model) and in battery life: the Versa conks out after only 80 minutes (its Windows rivals manage just over two hours). Playing DVD movies only hastens the battery drain; on this laptop, don't expect to watch much more of ''Gladiator'' than the opening credits. Clearly, NEC is targeting the well-paid executive who makes very short trips.</p>
        <p>For everyone else, a better choice might be Fujitsu's LifeBook S-4546. It, too, is amazingly light (4.5 pounds) and has a modular bay, one that can accommodate a much wider range of accessories, including a digital camera, a SuperDisk drive (for 120-megabyte diskettes), a second battery, a CD-RW drive or a DVD drive. Unfortunately, Fujitsu doesn't offer the combination CD-RW/DVD drive. It does, however, provide something its rivals don't: an illustrated, indexed manual, which makes a surprising amount of difference to your relationship with the machine.</p>
        <p>It explains, among other things, that the symbols on the L.C.D. readout just below the screen are status gauges for the battery, the PC card slots and so on. Over all, this is an extremely flexible and likable machine, and the price -- $2,500 with a CD-RW drive and a 600-megahertz Pentium III -- is at least within the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>The silvery WinBook X1 is about an inch deeper than its competitors, a depth that accommodates a 13.3-inch screen on the pricier models. (It doesn't show any more area than the 12.1-inch screen, but it magnifies the entire screen image.) The aluminum alloy case helps dissipate the heat of the only 1-gigahertz Pentium III chip available in this group of computers.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the touch-pad clicker buttons are extremely stiff along their back edges, so if that's where your thumb falls, you practically need to make an appointment for a mouse click. Note, too, that neither the WinBook X1 nor the Versa includes any productivity software at all, not even the Microsoft Works or AppleWorks software of its rivals. On the other hand, the price is right: $1,800 (for a 700-MHz Pentium III, 64 megabytes of memory and a CD drive) to $3,100 (with a 1-GHz Pentium III, 320 megabytes of memory and a combination drive).</p>
        <p>The new Apple iBook resembles its two-toned, orange or blue 1999 predecessor in name only. Swathed in what looks like glossy white acrylic, this rugged beauty looks less like sherbet swirl than a slab of ice. While the panels and stickers on the bottoms of Windows laptops make them look like aerial views of Iowa farms, the bottom of the new iBook is a single shiny sheet, broken only by the compartment that holds the battery. (It runs for about four and a half hours, making the iBook the only laptop here that can play a whole DVD movie on one charge.)</p>
        <p>Sweet touches abound. When opened, for example, the screen's bottom edge drops well below hinge level, thanks to a remarkable L-shaped hinge -- a small gesture of defiance against the reclining passenger in front of you. Like its rivals, the iBook sleeps when closed -- but only the iBook wakes when opened, with no key pressing required.</p>
        <p>On iBooks with CD-RW or combination drives, you find out how Apple thinks CD burning should work: you just drag files and folders onto a blank CD's desktop icon as though it were any old disk, and a Burn CD command does the rest. (The equivalent procedure on the Windows laptops requires you to open a special program -- the inappropriately named Easy CD Creator -- where you must choose from befuddling options like ''Track-At-Once,'' ''Close Session'' and ''Leave CD Open.'')</p>
        <p>The thrill of the iBook's design is marred only by a clamshell that doesn't close as tightly as it should (thanks to four protective rubber screen bumpers) and Apple's outrageous help-line policy: after 90 days, help is $50 per call.</p>
        <p>But the iBook's stealth feature is its price. The base model, at $1,300 (with 64 megabytes of RAM and a CD drive), is $500 less than the lowest-priced similarly configured Windows competitor, pounding a silver spike through the heart of the notion that Macintosh elegance necessarily commands a price premium. Even the top-of-the-line iBook -- with a CD-RW/DVD drive, 128 megabytes of memory and 20-gigabyte hard drive -- is only $1,800. As a result, the iBook is certain to cannibalize the sales of Apple's $2,600 titanium PowerBook G4, which offers an extra-wide screen, a PC card slot and better speed, but no CD-RW or combination drive option. But that's Apple's problem, not yours.</p>
        <p>Each of these laptops has something to recommend it: the NEC for low tonnage, the WinBook for speed, the Fujitsu for flexibility and the iBook for art and economy. Regardless of your religious persuasion (Mac or Windows), it's well worth peering into the margins between modern laptop categories. There you'll find poised, polished portables that require only one hand to lift and one business trip to appreciate.</p>
        <p>STATE OF THE ART  Correction:  June 2, 2001, Saturday  A picture caption in Circuits on Thursday with the State of the Art column, about lightweight laptop computers, misidentified the machine at the left. It was the WinBook X1, not the Fujitsu LifeBook S-4546.</p>
        <p>The column misstated the pricing for another computer, the Apple iBook. The $1,800 model has a 10-gigabyte hard drive; an upgrade to 20 gigabytes costs $200 more. The column also misstated the availability of manuals. The WinBook and the NEC Versa TXi, like the Fujitsu laptop, come with manuals.</p>
