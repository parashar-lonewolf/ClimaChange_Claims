        <p>IN a contest between uncertain science and uncertain economics, negotiators from around the world convened in Nairobi yesterday for what promises to be a contentious effort to act against the prospect of a possibly catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere in the next century.</p>
        <p>The talks, aimed at hammering out a treaty to be signed next June in Rio de Janeiro, are the first major test of whether the world can unite against a threat that appears real in the long term but whose magnitude and pacing are unclear and whose remedies may exact substantial economic costs.</p>
        <p>The crucial point is what to do about rising emissions of carbon dioxide, the principal man-made atmospheric gas among several that trap heat like the glass panes of a greenhouse.</p>
        <p>On this point, the United States, the world's biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, is the odd man out.</p>
        <p>The European Community and the Japanese strongly favor the adoption of concrete targets and timetables for stabilizing carbon dioxide emissions, specifically, holding them to 1990 levels in the year 2000. The United States just as strongly opposes such a target. The Bush Administration fears that meeting it would hurt the nation's economy in the short term for no demonstrable long-term climatic benefit. Rising levels of carbon dioxide come mainly from the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil, on which the country's economy depends. The Administration favors waiting, and remaining flexible, until further research makes the dimensions of the threat clearer.</p>
        <p>The Administration also says that if all the other heat-trapping gases besides carbon dioxide are taken into account, actions already taken by the United States will hold its net contribution to the atmosphere's heat-trapping capacity to 1990 levels in 2000. Besides carbon dioxide, the main heat-trapping gases are chlorofluorocarbons, methane and nitrous oxides. All of the latter are believed to be more powerful heat-trappers, molecule for molecule, than carbon dioxide, although their atmospheric concentrations are lower.</p>
        <p>United States emissions of carbon dioxide are still expected to rise over the next decade, but at a lower rate because of the new Clean Air Act and energy efficiencies mandated by Congress. The remaining growth, according to a study by the Environmental Protection Agency, will be offset by reductions in other greenhouse gases, mainly chlorofluorocarbons, which are already being phased out under an international agreement.</p>
        <p>Administration officials also argue that the United States's energy profile is different from that of Europe, relying more on motor vehicles to knit together vast distances and sprawling suburbs and on coal to produce electricity. Stabilizing carbon dioxide emissions, the Administration says, would therefore impose a bigger burden on the United States than on Europe. United States officials, including William K. Reilly, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, argue that within some broad framework, each country should be allowed to adopt a mixture of solutions that suits it best.</p>
        <p>The Bush Administration's arguments do not cut much ice with American environmentalists and some politicians, who see the Administration as a foot-dragger that has abdicated leadership on a question of transcendent importance for the future.</p>
        <p>"We simply don't have a vision and a policy and a plan," said Scott Hajost of the Environmental Defense Fund, who is attending the Nairobi talks and who was formerly involved in the issue as a lawyer for both the Environmental Protection Agency and the State Department.</p>
        <p>"The President has abdicated his responsibility because he is unwilling to propose anything that might be unpopular," said Senator Al Gore, Democrat of Tennessee, who has taken on global warming as a cause. "We are increasingly isolated" on the issue, said the Senator, who also accused the Administration of "scandalous obstinacy" and President Bush of "stonewalling the world."</p>
        <p>Environmentalists and many scientists have long contended that there is no time to waste in bringing greenhouse gas emissions under control. Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide have risen to more than 350 parts per million, up from 280 before the Industrial Revolution and from 315 three decades ago. The present concentration is substantially higher than at any time in the last 160,000 years. Some climatologists argue for early action on the ground that as far as modern humans are concerned, this is unexplored climatic territory. 'You Have to Start Somewhere'</p>
        <p>They also say climatic change might not occur gradually but suddenly, as rising temperatures trip certain triggers that shift the climate system to a new state. Moreover, some scientists contend, the longer action is delayed, the greater the climatic impact will be and the more painful and expensive it will be to deal with.</p>
        <p>The Europeans see their proposed targets as "a first, modest step" toward an eventual reversal of the buildup of carbon dioxide, said Bert Metz, an official at the Dutch embassy in Washington who is involved in the Nairobi talks. The Netherlands, as current president of the European Community, is speaking for the community in the talks. "You have to start somewhere," Mr. Metz said. "If you don't do anything, carbon dioxide will be 15 to 20 percent above 1990 levels" by 2000.</p>
        <p>"Apparently, for political reasons, the time is not right" for the United States to adopt stronger measures, Mr. Metz said, adding that "we still hope that the U.S. will come around."</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly, the E.P.A. chief, is one of several current and former officials who believe that economic forces and state and local pollution laws in the United States could bring about enough energy efficiencies in the years just ahead to stabilize the country's carbon dioxide emissions even if no further Federal actions are taken.</p>
        <p>"In my opinion, the climate policies of Europe and the United States will eventually converge," Mr. Reilly said, with "Europe relying on centralized, top-down directives and energy taxes, and the U.S. benefitting from decentralized, bottom-up decisions of electric utilities, their ratepayers and consumers to install more energy-efficient lighting and other technologies." Plan-and-Review Concept</p>
        <p>How the negotiations in Nairobi will turn out is anybody's guess. But it is widely believed that the United States could end up signing a treaty that sets broad, general goals for stabilizing greenhouse gases, possibly in the form of some sort of pledge subject to periodic review. The Europeans and Japan might then join in a separate protocol, excluding the United States, that sets specific targets for controlling carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>The Nairobi round of talks is the third of at least five such rounds, but the first in which it appears that the negotiators may get down to brass tacks. The first, at Chantilly, Va., last February, was given over largely to organizational matters and heated argument. The second, in Geneva in June, brought a blizzard of concrete proposals that have since been winnowed and consolidated as a basis for whatever takes place in the next few days.</p>
        <p>In two major developments at Geneva, the Japanese introduced the concept of pledge and review as a possible basis for an agreement, and the other industrialized countries appeared to view with more sympathy the United States's argument that all greenhouse gases, not just carbon dioxide, should be considered in devising remedies. Japan has since said that despite its advancement of pledge and review, it still favors specific commitments.</p>
        <p>While the industrialized countries are the primary emitters of greenhouse gases now, developing countries are expected to account for a rising share in the future. The developing countries and China are proposing in the negotiations that the industrialized countries contribute to a fund that would be used to ease the poorer nations through a transition to more energy-efficient technologies. These would generate less greenhouse gas. The status of the Soviet Union in the situation, given its political and economic upheavals, is unclear.</p>
        <p>The Europeans say their studies show that carbon dioxide emissions could be stabilized at an acceptable cost to their economies. Studies in the United States vary widely in their assessment of the economic impact. An inter-agency Government analysis published last year by the Department of Energy found that significant action to reduce carbon dioxide would reduce the gross national product by at least 1 percent. It found also that such action would have a negative impact on the economy comparable to that of the oil price shocks of the 1970's. Some subsequent studies have placed the reduction in G.N.P. lower, at less than half a percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly says he doubts that many economic studies have taken into consideration the energy efficiencies that he and others believe are coming as a result of market forces and state and local actions. Such efficiencies, if developed, would ease the economic impact.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, a special panel of the National Academy of Sciences found that the average global temperature was likely to rise by 2 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit in the next century if emissions of greenhouse gases continue unabated. This, the panel said, "poses a potential threat sufficient to merit prompt responses." The costs of not taking action, it said, could be substantial and could lower the standard of living in the United States. For developing countries, it said, the impact would probably be worse.</p>
        <p>The measured responses recommended by the panel, including a number of actions aimed at improving energy efficiency, were calculated to reduce United States greenhouse emissions by from 10 to 40 percent if all were in effect now, at "very low" net cost to the economy. Stronger actions, it said, are not now justified because the magnitude of the threat is still too uncertain. Assumptions on Carbon Dioxide</p>
        <p>The panel declined to recommend targets and timetables for reducing carbon dioxide on the ground that they would become obsolete as scientists learn more about the threat. Once written into law, some Administration officials say, such targets would be difficult to change.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists chided the Administration for opposing some actions recommended by the academy, including especially higher miles-per-gallon standards for automobiles. But Administration officials argued -- and the staff director of the academy study said they could be right -- that actions already taken will, over time, produce the effects the academy's recommends.</p>
        <p>That calculation, however, assumes that the relative power of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as heat-trappers remains what scientists have been saying it is. But although no details are yet available, new findings by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change may show that carbon dioxide is relatively more powerful than has been thought. This would tend to undercut the United States position. The I.P.C.C., established by the United Nations, provides scientific advice for the treaty negotiations.</p>
        <p>In any case, the academy report and the calculations about the effect of recent United States actions all were seized upon by Administration officials, especially John H. Sununu, the President's Chief of Staff, as support for their case. Mr. Sununu is by all accounts the most influential Administration official on climate change.</p>
        <p>The Administration's negotiating position in Nairobi is, in essence, that a deadline of the year 2000 for stabilizing carbon dioxide emissions is artificial, with no solid basis in either science or economics.</p>
        <p>"You know you've got a long-term problem,," said Robert A. Reinstein, a deputy assistant Secretary of State who is the chief United States negotiator. "You don't know what benefits you can expect from these short-term actions."</p>
        <p>"Do you do these things in a way that corresponds to an investment cycle, so that you retire equipment when you would retire it anyway and replace it with new equipment with climate benefits?" he asked. "Or do you prematurely retire it to meet an artificial target by 2000, which is not a scientifically determined target?" The United States view, he said, is that "it's really premature" to be talking about short-term targets and timetables like those proposed by the Europeans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reinstein has been accused by Senator Gore of misleading Congress late in July, when he said in written testimony that the European countries had "diminished their insistence" on targets and timetables at the June meeting in Geneva.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reinstein said that he was "not trying to say they had changed position," but was instead "describing the atmospherics."</p>
        <p>But Senator Gore said the language was "misleading, and in a way intended to buttress the Administration's decision to dig in its heels and stop progress."</p>
