        <p>LEAD: As the World Bank considers how to use its considerable economic leverage to help reduce the threat of global warming, environmentalists and politicians are complaining that it is not exerting strong leadership.</p>
        <p>As the World Bank considers how to use its considerable economic leverage to help reduce the threat of global warming, environmentalists and politicians are complaining that it is not exerting strong leadership.</p>
        <p>The issue has come into sharp focus with the disclosure by the Natural Resources Defense Council of a draft of a paper prepared by the bank's staff to guide the policy discussion. It outlines a number of ways in which the bank might encourage or induce developing countries to reduce the emission of carbon dioxide and other atmospheric gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect, in which the gases trap heat from the sun.</p>
        <p>Although the bulk of the pollution linked to the greenhouse effect comes from industrialized countries, the proportion attributable to the third world is rising. Promoting Natural Gas</p>
        <p>One major initiative, already adopted by the bank within the last few days, involves promoting the widespread use of natural gas rather than coal or oil in third-world energy projects financed by the bank. The burning of natural gas in electric generating turbines releases far less carbon dioxide into the air.</p>
        <p>But, citing scientific uncertainty about the long-term impact of the greenhouse effect, the talking paper excludes for now a number of other possible courses of action.</p>
        <p>Calling the document ''absolutely unacceptable,'' Senator Robert W. Kasten Jr., Republican of Wisconsin, said in a letter to Barber B. Conable, the president of the bank, that if the document ''were to influence global environmental policies, it would cause a disaster for the bank and the world.''</p>
        <p>Senator Kasten is the ranking Republican on the Foreign Operations Subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the subcommittee's former chairman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conable, who was not immediately available for comment, is to deliver a major speech on the bank's environmental policies at a conference in Tokyo on Monday. Two years ago, Mr. Conable announced that the bank would move environmental concerns from the periphery to the center of its development policy.</p>
        <p>The World Bank is the largest institution that finances third world development. Last year it committed more than $16 billion in loans. A legal affiliate of the bank, the International Development Association, committed nearly $5 billion. Before Mr. Conable's 1987 speech, the bank had long been accused by environmentalists and legislators of financing environmentally destructive projects. Now they are saying that in view of the bank's influence, it will be abdicating an important responsibility unless it acts more aggressively to help the third world do its part in combating global warming.</p>
        <p>The draft report says the ''clearest set of actions'' the bank might take involve ''promoting the efficient use of resources,'' especially energy.</p>
        <p>The report stresses natural gas as an alternative to coal and oil. Robert B. Saunders, a bank official who headed the working group that prepared the report, said that natural gas has been discovered in about 50 developing countries, but that ''not a lot is coming out of the ground.''</p>
        <p>The report stresses the promotion of energy efficiency through administrative reform, pricing policies and the introduction of competition in the power industry. It says that while alternative energy technologies such as solar power and small hydroelectric power plants are feasible in selected locations, they are still too costly for general application.</p>
        <p>The Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group, maintains that the range of options presented is too narrow. For example, it said in its own report, greater emphasis should be placed on more energy-efficient automobiles, appliances and buildings. Furthermore, it asserted, alternative energy sources should be factored into calculations by which the bank determines which sort of energy investment is the most economical. And it accused the report of giving ''shockingly short shrift'' to the role of forests in global climate change.</p>
