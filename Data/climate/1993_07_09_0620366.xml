        <p>At first glance, the catastrophic floods of the Midwest and the miserable but not-so-unusual heat wave in the East may seem unconnected, remote from each other. But they are part of one gigantic continental weather pattern that shows no sign of breaking up any time soon, though there are hints that it might moderate next week.</p>
        <p>The floods may owe their extraordinary character, meteorologists say, partly to the delayed impact of two global climatic events of last year: El Nino, the pool of warm water that develops every two to seven years in the eastern Pacific Ocean off South America, setting off a chain reaction that reverberates around the world, and Mount Pinatubo, the volcano in the Philippines that erupted in June 1991, thrusting a cooling haze into the atmosphere.</p>

        <p>At first glance, the catastrophic floods of the Midwest and the miserable but not-so-unusual heat wave in the East may seem unconnected, remote from each other. But they are part of one gigantic continental weather pattern that shows no sign of breaking up any time soon, though there are hints that it might moderate next week.</p>
        <p>The floods may owe their extraordinary character, meteorologists say, partly to the delayed impact of two global climatic events of last year: El Nino, the pool of warm water that develops every two to seven years in the eastern Pacific Ocean off South America, setting off a chain reaction that reverberates around the world, and Mount Pinatubo, the volcano in the Philippines that erupted in June 1991, thrusting a cooling haze into the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Both El Nino and the Pinatubo haze appear to be dissipating rapidly, but over the last year they produced conditions that combined with others to saturate the soil of the upper Mississippi valley with so much moisture that when this month's rains came, the water had no place to go. What followed was the kind of flood that comes only two or three times a century, sending the Mississippi outside its banks on a broad front.  Gridlock in the Skies</p>
        <p>The immediate cause of this week's sustained rains in the Midwest and the heat in the Northeast is essentially gridlock in the skies. A massive system of high pressure is stalled over the Atlantic Coast. Its winds pump moisture from the Gulf of Mexico into the Midwest, feeding the rainstorms, and warmth from the Gulf and deep South into the Northeast, sustaining the heat wave. The high-pressure system also prevents cold fronts from following their customary path into the East.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, residents and emergency workers along the upper Mississippi labored to avoid the fate of Keithsburg, Ill., where, The Associated Press reported, flood waters overwhelmed workers struggling to reinforce a levee to put part of the town of 750 under 20 feet of water. With more rain forecast for the rest of the week, the flooding has claimed at least 16 lives. Federal officials estimate that it has caused more than $1 billion in damage to crops and property so far.</p>
        <p>"Some locations have already had their highest floods of record," said Frederick J. Gadomski, a meteorologist at the Pennsylvania State University Weather Group, "and if the rain were to continue for the next few weeks we would be approaching in the upper Mississippi valley the flood of record." A 1973 flood there, believed to be the most destructive, caused property damage amounting to nearly $4 billion in today's dollars. Strong Jet Stream</p>
        <p>This week's weather pattern, which snapped into place in late June, is characterized by a stronger-than-normal jet stream, the west-to-east flow of air at an altitude of 20,000 feet, which has brought recurrent clusters of thunderstorms to the upper Mississippi valley.  The jet stream carry disturbances from the West, Mr. Gadomski said.  They are merely "dry little whirls" high in the atmosphere, but when they move east and collide with the moisture-laden high pressure system, the little whirls become big rainstorms.</p>
        <p>The high pressure system diverts the jet stream, with its cooling air, into northern Canada. What remains in the Northeast is a dome of hot air made all the hotter by circulating winds bringing up warmth from the Gulf region.  Result: Heat wave in the East.</p>
        <p>While the heat has buckled pavements, caused water pressure to drop, created general misery, posed a health hazard and set records in some places, "we're not stacking up even close to the most recent summer of real heat in the United States, which is 1988," Mr. Gadomski said. If this heat wave extends much into next week, "it will start to achieve some unusual status."</p>
        <p>So far, he said, it is an average heat wave of a duration and intensity that has occurred in the Northeast dozens of times. It is getting a lot of attention because last summer was so cool, with record low temperatures set in the Midwest and near-record lows in the Northeast. Some climatologists, though they say they cannot prove it, believe the Pinatubo haze was responsible for the coolness of 1992. The warm areas in the Western Hemisphere last year, they were far outweighed by cold areas, and the main variable seems to be the volcanic haze, said Jim Wagner, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service's Climate Analysis Center at Camp Springs, Md.  Not Tied to Global Warming</p>
        <p>The heat this year has specific causes that are not likely to be related to any general warming of the globe, Mr. Wagner said. Cool areas and warm areas are "just about balancing out" this summer, he said. Nonetheless some climatologists say there is an overall warming trend that will resume once the Pinatubo haze has fully dissipated, possibly next year. They see the trend as a result of emissions like carbon dioxide that trap heat in the atmosphere. In the two years just before the Mount Pinatubo eruption, the earth's average surface temperature set records.</p>
        <p>Although the weather pattern linking the Midwestern floods and the Eastern heat displays its own individual characteristics, the general type is a well-known example of the way the global climate works. But it has come on the heels of an unusually wet year in the upper Mississippi valley. Mr. Wagner explained it this way:</p>
        <p>Last summer, extraordinarily cool conditions in the region may have allowed less moisture to evaporate from the ground than usual. In the fall, a pattern similar to this week's, but without the eastern heat, brought more storms to the upper Midwest. In the winter, a subtropical jet stream set in motion by El Nino carried storms across California and the Southwest and up into the Mississippi valley from Missouri to southern Wisconsin, bringing still more moisture.  Saturated Ground</p>
        <p>Then the present pattern brought successive rains that pushed the upper Mississippi water table over the top.  The ground was so saturated that an ordinary rain could have brought minor flooding, "but we're not having ordinary rains, we're having repeated, excessive rains every few days," Mr. Wagner said.</p>
        <p>Both he and Mr. Gadomski said that while the pattern might shift and moderate somewhat next week, it would not go away.</p>
        <p>But, Mr. Gadomski said with what he described as great caution, the computer models that meteorologists use to predict the weather now display "that first flicker of a light at the end of the tunnel." The models suggest that the big high pressure along the Atlantic coast will move westward some time "in the misty future beyond about a week." If it were to move far enough, it would shift the Midwestern disturbances farther west as well. But afternoon thunderstorms could still develop in the upper Mississippi valley.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wagner said it looked as if the center of the high could shift next week to a new position somewhere over the Southeast. This would result in not quite as much moisture in the Mississippi valley. In the Northeast, he said, this development suggests more frequent breaks in the heat, though not an end to the heat wave, with temperatures averaging about normal or a little above.</p>
        <p>The Weather Service's official forecast for the period of July 10 through July 17 calls for above-normal rainfall for the Mississippi valley, normal temperatures for New York and Connecticut and above normal, but not much above normal, temperatures for New Jersey.</p>
