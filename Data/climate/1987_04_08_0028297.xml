        <p>LEAD: BROOKLYN, like Bordeaux, is wine country. Stephan Siciliano can prove it.

        <p>BROOKLYN, like Bordeaux, is wine country. Stephan Siciliano can prove it. He is cellar master of Sunset Hills Vineyards, a home winery only three minutes from the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. First, he treats you to the panoramic sweep of his backyard vines - both of them. Next, as at any chateau, you tour the winery; here it is reached by going down the basement stairs and turning left at the clothesline. It is state-of-the-art, from a 19th-century standpoint.</p>
        <p>Mr. Siciliano and Michael Farrell are the main wine makers. The label carrying their names and depicting the facade of Stephan and Maria Siciliano's row house announces, ''Fine, Full-Bodied Wines.'' The back label places the winery ''in the hilly, brownstone region of Sunset Park, on Long Island's western end.'' You have to figure out that the western end happens to be Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Most members of the small group of friends who share vintners' chores gathered at Sunset Hills last Saturday. Outside, a pouring rain hastened the budding of Mr. Siciliano's Marechal Foch vines. In the dining room, the group's dry 1985 zinfandel-grenache and 1985 merlot-cabernet blends - both delicious - poured, too, flowering into good cheer.</p>
        <p>Because of terrain conditions -pavement, basically - zinfandel, cabernet and merlot are not native to Brooklyn. They are, however, native to the Brooklyn Terminal Market, after arriving from California each autumn. That is when the group fills three cars with wooden crates and returns to Sunset Hills for the crush.</p>
        <p>The crew consists of Mr. Siciliano, who sells commercial interior materials like ceramic tiles and hardwood flooring; Mr. Farrell, who manages real estate; Daniel Danneman, a commercial real-estate broker, and his wife, Barbara, a weaver; Carol Spinella, a psychiatric nurse, and Mary Kosmark, a lawyer.</p>
        <p>Within hours, as backs ache from carrying crates, at least 1,000 pounds of red grapes are crushed. They are fermented for a week in large plastic containers. Mr. Siciliano runs up and down the stairs four or five times a day to monitor the churning wines, break up the caps of skins and seeds and plunge them into the must. A week later, everyone is on hand to press the pulp and fill 25 five-gallon water jugs in which the wine will settle down.</p>
        <p>The team returns on four more weekends during the vintage year to process the wine, ending with the bottling. Meanwhile, Mr. Siciliano keeps an eye on his French-American vines, bought from a Burpee seed catalogue. He pruned in February, and hopes that this year's yield will escalate. In 1986, he grew 15 pounds of grapes; with luck, this year he hopes to get 18 pounds.</p>
        <p>It's not impossible, he explained with a twinkle, because his home lies in a unique microclimate. Most important, he said, his grapes are influenced by the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, six blocks away. ''We have a localized greenhouse effect,'' he said. His theory: ''All the carbon dioxide emissions from the cars rise into the stratosphere and break up the ozone layer enveloping the earth. This causes the sun's heat to penetrate more easily, and raises the temperature in my backyard.''</p>
        <p>But that's not all. Like Chateau Mouton-Rothschild, which benefits from Bordeaux's proximity to the Gironde River and the Atlantic, Sunset Hills Vineyards is near the Narrows, whose ''ocean breezes have a tempering effect'' in winter and summer, Mr. Siciliano said. Besides, he added, ''I have loamy soil with good drainage, and traces of limestone, which will give my backyard wines a chalky flavor.''</p>
        <p>Limestone? Here? Mr. Siciliano explained: ''I try to get as close to Bordeaux style as possible. I read somewhere that they have limestone there. So I bought a five-pound bag of crushed limestone and added it to the soil.''</p>
        <p>The winery equipment used by the group, whose members function like a cooperative, consists of a crusher, an old-fashioned screw press with wooden slats, a hand-operated corker, eight 10- and 20-gallon barrels of toasted American oak bought new, and 25 glass jugs. Today the jugs contain the 1986 vintage, whose yeast is settling out.</p>
        <p>Not every wine is successful. Some of the 1984 barbera is said to be good, but the whole neighborhood may get a lot of free vinegar soon.</p>
        <p>Ms. Spinella said that friends often ask her to bring her wine to dinner parties. The '85 zinfandel is the best wine Sunset Hills has made, she said. Mr. Farrell said he had gotten ''less hesitant about sharing our wine with others - I've had a positive response to it.''</p>
        <p>The crew made 130 gallons - about 600 bottles - in 1985; production dropped to about 90 gallons last year because merlot could not be found. Federal law restricts home wine makers to 200 gallons per household each year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Siciliano took up home wine making five years ago to continue a tradition begun by his paternal grandfather, an immigrant. A proud moment in his mini-career occurred last September when his brother, Jude, a Dominican priest, celebrated a mass marking the 50th wedding anniversary of their parents, Sophie and Joseph Siciliano, at St. Frances de Chantal in Brooklyn. Father Siciliano's homily dwelt upon Jesus' first miracle, at Cana, when water was transformed into wine during a wedding. Then he used his brother's zinfandel during communion.</p>
        <p>A philosophical clash shattered Sunset Hills' tranquility in 1985 when Mr. Siciliano and Mr. Farrell decided to make white wine - sauvignon blanc - for the first time. At issue was the use of sulfites as a preservative. Mr. Siciliano insisted they were necessary to keep the wine from spoiling. ''No chemicals,'' Mr. Farrell said. So they made two batches, with and without sulfites. Months passed. Mr. Farrell's wine died. Mr. Siciliano's lived. Mr. Farrell grudgingly admitted he was wrong. (He still calls his partner's sauvignon blanc ''Chernobyl White.'') Last year, Mr. Danneman and Mr. Siciliano attended a tasting of California wines at the Yale Club in Manhattan. They tried the Jordan Winery's 1982 cabernet. It is true that Jordan cabernets are among Sonoma County's most sophisticated. It is also true that Mr. Danneman and Mr. Siciliano are not exactly impartial judges of their own wines. ''The Jordan was fine, clean, had a good backbone, but ours is better - it has a fuller flavor,'' Mr. Danneman said.</p>
        <p>Soon Tom Graham, an artist and a friend of the group, will design new labels for Sunset Hills. And Mrs. Siciliano, who will write the copy for them, is contemplating a new description of the wines: ''Assertive -but not arrogant.''</p>
