        <p>ALBANY, Feb. 3 Â— William M. Flynn, a politically well-connected former prosecutor, sailed through the Senate confirmation process today to become the chairman of the Public Service Commission, after Republicans cut offquestions about his record during his confirmation hearing.</p>

        <p>William M. Flynn, a politically well-connected former prosecutor, sailed through the Senate confirmation process today to become the chairman of the Public Service Commission, after Republicans cut off questions about his record during his confirmation hearing.</p>
        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki nominated Mr. Flynn, who has close ties to many Republican politicians in western New York, for the $127,000-a-year post two weeks ago. He will succeed Maureen O. Helmer, who stepped down last month after several disagreements with the administration over energy deregulation.</p>
        <p>Several lawmakers said Mr. Flynn's confirmation hearings made a mockery of the Senate's role in appointments and highlighted the lackluster committee system in the Legislature.</p>
        <p>The Republican-controlled Senate overwhelmingly approved Mr. Flynn's appointment after a 40-minute committee meeting in which Democrats were not allowed to ask Mr. Flynn about his role, as deputy attorney general, in dropping manslaughter charges against an Elmira pipe company with a poor safety record.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes I feel like we are just making believe we are having confirmation hearings,'' Senator Thomas Duane, a Manhattan Democrat, said after he was told that he could ask no questions about the 1995 case.</p>
        <p>During the hearing, Mr. Flynn gingerly sidestepped questions about whether he considered garbage incinerators a form of renewable energy and how he would handle the siting of new power plants, both critical issues for the commission. He gave a vague promise to listen to all sides before making a decision.</p>
        <p>Asked if he considered burning trash a renewable energy source, he said, ''For me to come in front of this body and prejudge an issue as important as that would be irresponsible.''</p>
        <p>The Public Service Commission is a powerful and ostensibly independent board that oversees utilities and the telecommunications industry, though in practice the governor controls it. It regulates the electricity market, some telephone rates and some mergers of utilities. The commission also directly oversees the construction of new power plants.</p>
        <p>During the confirmation hearing, the Finance Committee chairman, Senator Owen Johnson of Long Island, cut off questions from Senator Duane about Mr. Flynn's role in dropping manslaughter charges against the Kennedy Valve Company in connection with the 1995 death of an employee, Frank J. Wagner, who was killed in an explosion after being told to incinerate hundreds of gallons of paint.</p>
        <p>''I believe you are asking questions that are not relevant,'' Senator Johnson told Senator Duane.</p>
        <p>Later, Mr. Flynn said through a spokesman that the Kennedy case had been handled appropriately.</p>
        <p>Asked if the governor took into account Mr. Flynn's role in the Kennedy Valve case in nominating him, Lisa Stoll, Mr. Pataki's chief spokeswoman, said, ''The governor knows Bill Flynn is highly qualified and has confidence he will do a tremendous job.''</p>
        <p>Some environmentalists regard Mr. Flynn as a good choice, notwithstanding his long career as a political appointee. His most recent job -- also an appointment by the governor -- was as president of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, where he won the respect of some clean-air advocates through his administration of energy-conservation programs.</p>
        <p>In the attorney general's office, Mr. Flynn was responsible for the hiring and firing of more than 100 lawyers, even though he himself failed the bar exam seven times in five years before receiving his law license in 1992, court papers show.</p>
        <p>Many environmentalists predicted that Mr. Flynn, with his political debts to the governor, would be less independent than Ms. Helmer, who has feuded with Mr. Pataki over his desire to roll back some parts of the state's free-market energy policy.</p>
        <p>Specifically, she fought a recent proposal to let electric companies enter long-term contracts with power generators. In 2001, she also disagreed with the governor's proposal to finance conservation programs through an extra surcharge on electricity bills.</p>
        <p>''Bill Flynn will be much more receptive to energy efficiency and environmental concerns,'' said Ashok Gupta, an expert on air quality with the Natural Resources Defense Council.</p>
        <p>Other environmentalists, however, were troubled that Mr. Flynn would not take a public stand on incineration before the Senate committee. The governor has said he wants a quarter of the energy sold in New York to come from renewable sources like windmills and solar cells by 2013.</p>
        <p>Current state regulations do not define garbage-to-energy incinerators as a renewable source, but when he was asked his opinion at the hearing, Mr. Flynn would not rule them out as a possible part of the governor's plans.</p>
