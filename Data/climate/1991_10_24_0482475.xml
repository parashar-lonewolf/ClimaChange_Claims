        <p>Despite strong environmental warnings and intense international pressures, the Bush Administration has continued to advocate more research rather than immediate action to counter such threats as ozone depletion and global warming. Two new developments put this business-as-usual approach in scary perspective:</p>
        <p>* A United Nations scientific panel reported that new data had disclosed significant and previously undiscovered depletion of the ozone layer over the United States and Europe</p>
        <p>in summer</p>
        <p>, when the sun's ultraviolet rays pose the greatest hazard; therefore, the incidence of skin cancers and the damage to crops will be much greater than previously predicted.</p>
        <p>* Richard Lindzen of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a respected scientific critic of global warming theories, told a group of scientists in Washington that he had "withdrawn" the complex hypothesis that was an important element of his skepticism.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lindzen's views carried considerable weight in the political controversy about global warming, having been cited frequently by the Bush White House in support of its go-slow policy. Senator Albert Gore of Tennessee, who convened the scientific group, said that while Dr. Lindzen remained skeptical on general grounds, he had abandoned the specific theory he previously advanced.</p>
        <p>Both the ominous new ozone data and Dr. Lindzen's changed position seem to justify a heightened urgency in responding to threatening atmospheric developments. Dr. Robert Watson, a NASA scientist who was co-chairman of the U.N. panel, termed the new findings of ozone loss "extremely serious."</p>
        <p>In Washington, Senator Gore said he would re-introduce a resolution to accelerate the schedule for phasing out chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's, the man-made chemical most damaging to the ozone layer. William K. Reilly, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, conceded that the ozone problem had been shown to be "more serious than we believed" and added, "The world community needs to reconsider the course that it's on."</p>
        <p>In the past, the White House has not agreed. John Sununu, the chief of staff, has opposed what he considers premature action against global warming; he and President Bush argue that eliminating CFC's is sufficient for now. Mr. Reilly said the U.S. was ahead of the schedule by which the industrial nations have agreed to eliminate CFC's by the year 2000.</p>
        <p>But a U.N. environment official, Dr. Mostafa K. Tolba, said "the main emphasis should be on carbon dioxide," the primary cause of global warming. Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide have increased by 25 percent in the last century, and are increasing by about 0.5 percent a year.</p>
        <p>President Bush has been reluctant to force cuts in carbon dioxide emissions -- opposing, for example, an increase from 27.5 to 32.5 miles per gallon in automobile fuel efficiency, and more support for mass transit, both urged by a National Academy of Sciences report on global warming.  Nor has the Administration pushed development of alternative energy sources, as the academy urged.</p>
        <p>The new data made public at the U.N. demonstrate that CFC's, by destroying parts of the ozone layer, have a slight cooling effect, since the layer helps keep temperatures stable.  Thus if CFC's are eliminated, as projected, the global warming trend -- primarily the product of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere -- would be strengthened. That appears to undercut the President's resistance to reducing carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
        <p>The danger to humans in disappearing ozone is not in such dispute; for each 1 percent of depletion, a 1 percent increase in the incidence of fatal skin cancers (melanoma) and a 3 percent rise in nonfatal skin cancers are projected. About 4 to 5 percent of atmospheric ozone has been lost since measurement began in 1978, which means a total of perhaps 10 percent since about the end of World War II. Dr. Watson said the U.N. panel expected a further 3 percent loss by the end of the century.</p>
        <p>The last previous predictions -- 12 million ozone-related skin cancers resulting in 200,000 deaths in the next half-century -- thus have been shown by the new data to be drastically understated. And the ozone crisis is here and now -- as close at hand as your next trip to the beach, or bareheaded walk in the sun.</p>
