        <p>LEAD: Finding an eye-catching way to ridicule the Secretary of the Interior, Donald P. Hodel, is this week's sport in the House of Representatives.</p>
        <p>Finding an eye-catching way to ridicule the Secretary of the Interior, Donald P. Hodel, is this week's sport in the House of Representatives.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hodel outraged many members of Congress by suggesting last month, at a meeting of President Reagan's Council on Domestic Policy, that hats, sunglasses and sun screens could be effective alternatives to an international treaty as a way of protecting people from the ultraviolet radiation reaching the earth because of depletion of the ozone layer. His proposal for ''personal protection'' was seen by opponents as undercutting a tentative 31-nation agreement to reduce the use of the refrigerants, solvents and aerosols that are destroying the protective ozone layer.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Representative Thomas J. Downey, a New York Democrat, appeared on the House floor wearing a big hat and dark glasses. ''These are the new weapons,'' Mr. Downey said.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, two more Democrats, James H. Scheuer of Brooklyn and Patricia Schroeder of Colorado, played a verbal duet on the subject. Mr. Scheuer brought to the floor a half-dozen poster-size cutouts of animals, including a lion and an owl, decked out in hats and sunglasses. Their point was that animals, too, would need ''personal protection'' from ultraviolet rays under Mr. Hodel's approach.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Scheuer noted that his lion looked ''very natty'' in a safari hat and sunglasses, Ms. Schroeder observed: ''I fear he looks terribly wimpy, though. It may make him very angry.''</p>
        <p>After agreeing that animals could scarcely be expected to spread suntan lotion on themselves, the two suggested a ''buddy system'' under which animals could learn to spread lotion on one another.</p>
