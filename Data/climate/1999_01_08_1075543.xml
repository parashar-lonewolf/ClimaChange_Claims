        <p>Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and legislative leaders reached agreement today on a plan to cut commercial and residential electricity rates by 10 percent over the next three years and deregulate the state's energy market.</p>

        <p>Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and legislative leaders reached agreement today on a plan to cut commercial and residential electricity rates by 10 percent over the next three years and deregulate the state's energy market.</p>
        <p>The plan, which cleared two critical committees today and is expected to win passage by the Legislature next week, would dissolve the monopolies that have controlled New Jersey's $10 billion electricity and natural gas markets for decades, end the state's policy of setting utility rates and allow consumers to choose between competing suppliers -- the way they now choose long-distance telephone carriers.</p>
        <p>But some important aspects remain to be worked out, and it is far from certain that the initiative will foster vigorous competition or produce long-term savings to New Jersey consumers.</p>
        <p>State officials formulated the plan because many business owners complained that New Jersey's energy rates, now 50 percent higher than the national average, were hampering attempts to lure new industries and create jobs.</p>
        <p>Under the plan, which is expected to go into effect in August, homeowners can expect to see an immediate 5 percent reduction in their monthly electric bills and an additional 5 percent drop to be phased in during the following two years. The average residential customer spends $852 a year on electricity.</p>
        <p>After the fourth year, market forces will set the rates, and it is possible that those forces will allow rates to rise rather than fall. New Jersey residents will also be able to choose between competing natural gas companies beginning in December.</p>
        <p>Slightly different forms of the bill were voted out of committee today in both houses of the Republican-controlled Legislature,  and if the two chambers can reconcile their differences it is expected to face a vote before the full Assembly and Senate on  Tuesday -- just hours before Governor Whitman delivers her State of the State address.</p>
        <p>''This is a near-final step in a very long journey to lower people's electric rates,''  Mrs. Whitman said. ''We just hope the Assembly and Senate can resolve the remaining issues.''</p>
        <p>But many consumer groups, environmental organizations and Democrats complained that the plan did not go far enough. They said that it favored the state's three dominant electricity suppliers -- Public Service Electric and Gas, Connectiv and GSU Energy -- and that it forced residential customers to subsidize most of the $9 billion  lost by the utilities' investments in nuclear plants in the last two decades.</p>
        <p>The New Jersey Public Interest Research Group also contended that the bill did little to protect the state's environment from acid rain caused by the generation of electricity, which produces more air pollutants than almost any other industry.</p>
        <p>One Democratic version of the legislation would have offered sales tax reductions to energy providers that met certain emission standards, including those Middle Western and Western energy producers that operate under less stringent environmental rules.</p>
        <p>But Republican leaders instead ordered that New Jersey utilities spend $140 million of their own funds on equipment that would allow them to generate power in a more environmentally friendly way.</p>
        <p>''This is one of the largest anti-consumer, anti-environmental bills we've ever seen,'' said John Paul Guinan, an energy advocate for the the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group.</p>
        <p>He plans to tour the state to warn residents of what he considers shortcomings in the bill.</p>
        <p>''New Jersey residents need to realize that they are getting a very bad deal here.''</p>
        <p>Assuming the plan goes through, New Jersey will become the 14th state to restructure its energy regulations since 1996, part of a national movement to encourage competition in the utilities market.</p>
        <p>New York State will phase in deregulation in the next decade.</p>
        <p>But in most states, the deregulation plans have yet to fulfill the promise of creating meaningful competition among energy suppliers, according to Eileen Doherty, an energy policy expert for the National Conference of State Legislatures.</p>
        <p>Small utility companies say the programs adopted in most states do not provide enough financial incentives for consumers to switch their power companies or to entice new suppliers to enter the market.</p>
        <p>The legislators who forged the New Jersey bill say they included several mechanisms designed to spur competition and lower utility costs for businesses and residents in the state.</p>
        <p>One provision will allow municipalities to buy energy en masse, on behalf of their residents, increasing their bargaining power.</p>
        <p>But the Senate and Assembly disagreed on what steps consumers would be required to take to opt out of such plans, and that sticking point could delay the final passage of the program.</p>
        <p>Under deregulation, any energy company will be allowed to sell electricity to New Jersey consumers. But the state's three existing utilities will still control delivery of the power, and will charge for the cost of distributing electricity along transmission lines, plus a surcharge for their existing debts in unprofitable plants.</p>
        <p>Although the deregulation bills approved were highly detailed documents of more than 100 pages, they still left several complex technical issues to be resolved by the state's Board of Public Utilities. Those decisions could ultimately determine whether New Jerseyans see real competition and long-term rate reductions.</p>
        <p>Those issues include devising a system of so-called shopping credits to make it easy for consumers to directly compare the prices offered by competing companies, and determining how much money existing utilities can recover for their past debts.</p>
