        <p>After four grinding years of negotiations, the final details of a pioneering treaty aimed at fighting global warming emerged from talks in Morocco yesterday, and many large industrial countries, excepting the United States, said they were likely to ratify the agreement.</p>
        <p>If enacted, and significant hurdles still must be crossed for that to happen, the treaty, called the Kyoto Protocol, would set the first binding restrictions on releases of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases by industrial countries.</p>
        <p>President Bush rejected the treaty in March, limiting its reach by putting the United States, the largest source of such gases, on the sidelines. At the time, the decision caused some other countries, most notably Japan, Canada, Russia and Australia, to hesitate.</p>
        <p>But after two weeks of discussions in Marrakesh among this group, along with developing countries and the European Union, the treaty's strongest proponent, agreement was reached on a set of compromises.</p>
        <p>''The Kyoto Protocol is saved,'' Olivier DeLeuze, head of the delegation from the European Union, said after the deal was announced.</p>
        <p>Negotiations were far tougher than those producing every other past international environmental treaty, officials of many governments said, because cuts in these emissions will come mainly from restricting the burning of coal, oil and other fossil fuels, the underpinning of industrial economies.</p>
        <p>The industrial countries that sign on will be required, as a group, to cut emissions by 2012 to levels about 5 percent below emissions levels in 1990. That shared target will be easier to achieve, in part, because Russia and some other countries, after the collapse of Communism, saw emissions drop far below 1990 levels.</p>
        <p>As happens to most international agreements, the treaty lost some of its initial vision over years of negotiation between blocs of countries that would be affected differently by its terms. For example, Russia, Canada and Japan sought and gained substantial credit toward their gas targets for the ability of their forests to absorb carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas.</p>
        <p>In telephone interviews yesterday, American officials at the meeting gave no sign that the Bush administration would reconsider joining the effort. ''Other countries have chosen their path, and our answer is still no,'' said a senior member of the American delegation.</p>
        <p>Some of Mr. Bush's critics in the Senate, most notably James M. Jeffords of Vermont, chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, criticized the administration's lack of an alternative to the treaty. He said that Washington ''refuses to take responsibility for its share of the problem.''</p>
        <p>Most climate scientists say that a buildup of greenhouse gases has caused at least part of the world's warming trend that could lead to droughts, floods and agricultural disruption.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has said that the Kyoto pact could harm the American economy and was unfair because developing countries like China and India were excused from any obligations to make emissions cuts.</p>
        <p>In a statement delivered at the closing ceremonies, Paula J. Dobriansky, the under secretary of state for global affairs, said the Bush administration was still committed to solving the problem, but in its own way and at its own pace. ''Climate change is a serious issue that requires real action,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the completion of the treaty -- even without the United States and with various compromises -- still represented an important moment in industrial history, environment experts said.</p>
        <p>After a century of growing use of fossil fuels with little regard for the impacts of a steady buildup of greenhouse gases, many experts said, this is the first global mechanism for limiting such environmental harm.</p>
        <p>''It's by far the strongest environmental treaty that's ever been drafted, from the beginning to the end, from the soup of measuring emissions to the nuts of the compliance regime,'' said David D. Doniger, the director of climate programs for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private environmental group.</p>
        <p>''The parties have reached complete agreement on what's an infraction, how you decide a case and what are the penalties,'' said Mr. Doniger, who attended the meeting. ''That's as good as it gets in international relations.''</p>
        <p>Another innovation in the treaty is its unfettered trading mechanism for greenhouse-gas emissions. Until last summer, the European Union, driven by strong public sentiment, had staunchly opposed allowing a country to get credit towards its emissions targets by investing in cheaper pollution cleanup projects overseas.</p>
        <p>But under pressure from Japan, Canada and Russia, that opposition faded in Marrakesh, negotiators said. The goal of such trading is to foster international markets for energy-efficient technologies, treaty supporters said.</p>
        <p>''The Marrakesh results send a clear signal to business, local governments and the general public that climate-friendly products, services and activities will be rewarded,'' said Michael Zammit-Cutajar, a United Nations official.</p>
        <p>To gain legal force, the treaty must be ratified by at least 55 countries, including a group responsible for at least 55 percent of the heat-trapping emissions from industrial countries in 1990. With the United States out, that threshold can be achieved only with the support of both Japan and Russia.</p>
        <p>Russia gave strong signals yesterday that it was satisfied. In a statement made before the meeting closed, Aleksandr I. Bedritsky, the lead negotiator from Russia, said the agreement ''opens the path for the ratification by all countries, including the Russian Federation.''</p>
        <p>Representatives of Japan, where industries are fighting the pact, were more circumspect. That hesitation is natural because Japan -- under the arithmetic of the treaty -- will have to make significant cuts in emissions domestically to reach its target, said Dr. Richard L. Schmalensee, dean of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
        <p>Europe is in a better position to meet its targets because it benefits from the large cuts in emissions that already occurred in Britain and Germany for economic, not environmental, reasons. The Europeans took credit in Marrakesh for leading on the issue.</p>
        <p>Many officials at the meeting said that Mr. Bush, who is dedicated to building and maintaining an alliance against terrorism, was missing an opportunity to seek an international approach to the environment.</p>
        <p>Dr. Schmalensee said the main benefit of the treaty was not the modest cuts in emissions it set, but the mechanisms and institutions it would create. ''It'll build some engagement and the habit of compliance,'' he said. ''This is a first step.''</p>
