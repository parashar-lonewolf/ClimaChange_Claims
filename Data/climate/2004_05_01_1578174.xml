        <p>David Brooks (column, April 20) gives me more power and credit than are due. I am not blocking legislation to control power plant pollution. Rather, I want a strong, comprehensive measure and have repeatedly announced my willingness to negotiate to achieve that end.

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>David Brooks (column, April 20) gives me more power and credit than are due. I am not blocking legislation to control power plant pollution. Rather, I want a strong, comprehensive measure and have repeatedly announced my willingness to negotiate to achieve that end. Unfortunately, the Bush administration has done nothing to move a bill and everything to undermine its chances.</p>
        <p>The Clean Air Act was developed through painstaking years of compromise and collaboration. But instead of attracting the stakeholders interested in negotiating multipollutant legislation, the Bush administration has alienated many by handing out gifts of deregulation to utilities and their friends. Those gifts include reversing the president's campaign pledge on controlling carbon dioxide, crippling the New Source Review program, weakening and delaying scheduled mercury controls and deferring visibility improvements for parks and public lands.</p>
        <p>There is nothing left on the table as incentive to negotiate. It is extremely difficult to block something that has zero momentum and no one pushing it.</p>
        <p>JAMES M. JEFFORDS  Washington, April 30, 2004</p>
        <p>The writer is ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.</p>
