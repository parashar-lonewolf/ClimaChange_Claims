        <p>O.K., so those corkscrewy compact fluorescent light bulbs cost a lot -- up to eight times more than regular incandescent bulbs. They can buzz annoyingly and cast a pallid light that many people find icky. But in other respects they are amazingly easy to love. They use about 75 percent less electricity than ordinary bulbs and can last 10 times longer. Just one bulb can save its owner $30 or more over its long, virtuous life. Thinking globally, it's possible to imagine billions of bulbs saving billions of dollars and countless kilowatts, thus vastly reducing the burning of coal and the production of planet-warming carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>That is, if enough people around the globe screw them in.</p>
        <p>A county legislator, Martin Rogowsky, wants to hasten that day in Westchester. He has proposed a bill to ban the use of incandescent bulbs in county buildings, thus necessitating the switch to compact fluorescents. It's a worthy goal, and one that prompts a question: How many officials would it take to change all the county's bulbs?</p>
        <p>Maybe just one -- the County Executive, Andrew Spano, who could render Mr. Rogowsky's bill unnecessary simply by decreeing that the county make the bulb switch in its own buildings. The upfront costs will be high, but the savings would eventually be significant, not just in energy and money but also in effort expended by the guys who have to change them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spano is already no slouch on environmental issues, having created a county task force on global warming and begun an array of other green initiatives. He listed some in his State of the County address last Thursday, from buying more hybrid vehicles for the county fleet to proposing a bill to ban an especially dirty type of gas-burning leaf blower. He pointed out that New York ranks a dreary 45th of 50 states in buying compact fluorescent bulbs, and announced that the county would be giving away 5,000 of them, one per household, over the Earth Day weekend next month.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spano and Mr. Rogowsky clearly have the right idea on bulbs. In addition to his April bulb giveaway, Mr. Spano should give Mr. Rogowsky's proposal serious consideration, and explore other ways to greatly increase the use of compact fluorescents in the county, including giving coupons and rebates to residents who can't afford to buy a lot of $8 bulbs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rogowsky's dreamy goal is nothing less than the end of incandescence in Westchester. His bill goes a bit too far by also proposing to ban the sale of incandescent bulbs in the county by 2010. That is a stretch, given the expense and short time frame, and is sure to be opposed by those who can't yet wean themselves from warm, golden glow of a bulb with a filament. But Mr. Rogowsky deserves credit for jump-starting the global-warming discussion, as does Mr. Spano for giving the county a good push in the right direction.</p>
