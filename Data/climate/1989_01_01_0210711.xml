        <p>LEAD: In the theater, as in life, people have been discovering that the fast track can be a treadmill. They are forced to confront what could be called the Yuppie Trauma: early success leading to young-life crisis. If you rise to the top of a profession before you are 30 - as stockbroker, movie producer, publisher, theater director - burnout may result when you are 30 something.</p>
        <p>In the theater, as in life, people have been discovering that the fast track can be a treadmill. They are forced to confront what could be called the Yuppie Trauma: early success leading to young-life crisis. If you rise to the top of a profession before you are 30 - as stockbroker, movie producer, publisher, theater director - burnout may result when you are 30 something.</p>
        <p>Increasingly on stage - and in films and on television - the Yuppie Trauma has become a subject for dramatic and comedic contemplation as audiences are asked to understand the vicissitudes of being young and prosperous. For many, sympathies stop short; in a world beset by terrorism, acid rain, hunger and earthquakes, the problems of young upwardly mobile careerists seem marginal, perhaps even incomprehensible. But our concern can of course be deepened by the seriousness of the artistic approach. Coincidentally, the three most striking new plays I have seen so far this season deal revealingly with the subject: Richard Greenberg's ''Eastern Standard,'' which opens at the Golden Theater on Thursday after its engagement at Manhattan Theater Club; Wendy Wasserstein's ''The Heidi Chronicles'' now at Playwrights Horizons and maybe headed for Broadway, and Dennis McIntyre's ''National Anthems,'' presently at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven and a strong candidate for transfer to New York.</p>
        <p>Each of the plays takes a disparate view of the brat race, but in common the authors are able to hold their characters at arm's length, to be ironic as well as sympathetic. None of them accepts any pretension; all are concerned with broader, human issues, such as the loss of individualism in the cogs of the system. To the question, does one care about yuppies, we can answer, only when they are as human as they are in these plays. For these three thoughtful playwrights, yuppies are a microcosm of an endangered society. They are just succeeding earlier and crashing more quickly. In each case, the message is enhanced in the delivery. The playwrights have been given assured productions in which the actors mirror the perspicacity of the plays.</p>
        <p>The perspective is partly a reflection of the playwrights' ages. Ms. Wasserstein is 38; Mr. McIntyre, 46. The youngest of them, Mr. Greenberg, is 30 and he is the one most deeply immersed in the world and speaks from front-line experience. He has already explored the subject in a number of plays. In his melancholic ''Life Under Water,'' adolescents idle richly in the Hamptons before swimming in the mainstream. ''The Maderati'' was a gleeful assault on the glittering celebrity of publishing, posing the question, ''What does being good have to do with getting published?'' In the hilarious one-act ''The Author's Voice,'' Mr. Greenberg carried the premise into surrealism. A handsome, suave new novelist has all the qualities for success - except for the fact that he has absolutely no talent. The actual author, his ghostwriter, could be Quasimodo's identical twin. He is confined in a locked room, from which he secretly produces the author's art. Personality, self-presentation, sex appeal are all important conditions of yuppiehood.</p>
        <p>Then there is the reverse side: sudden, sometimes insincere, altruism. The high-flyers in ''Eastern Standard'' have a spasm of self-doubt and social remorse. Stephen (Dylan Baker), the central character, is an architect who designs high-rise monoliths all over Manhattan, until he realizes the social responsibility he bears. He is urban blight. His girlfriend, Phoebe (Patricia Clarkson), a stockbroker, finally faces the fact that her co-workers may be evil (and that she shares in the complicity). Drew (Peter Frechette), an artist and the most naturally cynical in the group, feels that his peers, the Julian Schnabels and the David Salles, are on ''the cutting edge of the passe'' - and where does that leave him?</p>
        <p>The characters respond by inviting a homeless person to the Hamptons. Responding to their innate hypocrisy, the bag lady steals their valuables. Possessions are themselves amulets of success, as in Mr. McIntyre's ''National Anthems.'' In that bitter play, Arthur and Leslie Reed (Tom Berenger and Mary McDonnell), a wealthy Midwestern couple, buy the brand names and memorize the buzz words of their times. Their life style is a glossy photographic spread in House &amp; Garden magazine. They do not simply have a stereo; they have a Bang &amp; Olufsen music system with RL140 speakers. In their driveway is a silver BMW, which the husband is thinking of upgrading to a Porsche.</p>
        <p>The Reeds are startled from their false paradise by a visit from a confrontational neighbor, Ben Cook (Kevin Spacey). After a late-night housewarming party, he unloads an unwelcome wagon of disparaging remarks about the complacent couple, their life and their unseen friends, all of whom seem to spend their time hang-gliding, ice-boating and making money. For a long stretch the hosts are unfailingly courteous - company manners even for the unmannerly. The living room war begins with the neighbor's casual assault on the expensive Milanese furniture and continues with a bruising scrimmage of tackle football. The neighbor, who is a fireman, eventually poses his sense of civic duty opposite their acquisitiveness and quest for status.</p>
        <p>That fireman would have been far more gracious to the heroine of Ms. Wasserstein's play. Heidi (Joan Allen) is a good girl of the 1960's, someone who demonstrated for feminism, campaigned for Senator Eugene McCarthy and could be enlisted in any ecological emergency. In her personal life, she is wary about settling for any prescribed goal, whether it is marrying well or seeking worldly advantage. Meanwhile her friends are leaping prematurely into positions of prestige and power. A faithless lover and former liberal activist ends up publishing a trendy magazine called Boomer. One could imagine the characters in all three plays sitting down with the latest issue of Boomer to see how the other fellow got there first, if indeed he did.</p>
        <p>Heidi herself is an art historian, woefully aware of the neglect suffered by women artists who painted in secrecy. An epiphany comes to her in an aerobics class, where she is surrounded by overachievers in mind and body. Cowed by her sisters, but not blaming them for her depression, Heidi feels stranded, and, almost, out of ideals. She finds a renewed strength in her independence, in her willingness to forego competition in the mainstream. She also achieves an additional sense of purpose by adopting a child, adding single motherhood to her other concerns.</p>
        <p>Similarly, in ''Eastern Standard'' the characters look to marriage for stability - to coupling and to friends as family (a recurrent theme in many yuppie plays). The Reeds in ''National Anthems'' have no such solace - not even intimate friends to keep their fireside warm. When the neighbor leaves, after his anguished recounting of his own failed attempt at heroism, the couple's elegant home is in disarray. The host and hostess sit silently as if at the end of a siege.</p>
        <p>Though it begins with wry humor, ''National Anthems'' has the most mordant conclusion. That is not to suggest that the other two plays end on an upbeat note. Each leaves theatergoers - and the other characters in the plays - in a state of sobering inquietude. For Heidi, motherhood is more of a challenge than a solution. In ''Eastern Standard,'' the architect and the stockbroker may marry as planned, but the stockbroker's brother is, as we know, dying of AIDS. The anguish of AIDS is also a backdrop in ''The Heidi Chronicles,'' as the heroine's gay soulmate (Boyd Gaines), a successful pediatrician, confronts losses in his own life.</p>
        <p>These three plays deal directly with the yuppie experience, but each raises more universal issues that are also reflected in current works on other stages. The suburban country club world of A.R. Gurney, Jr.'s ''Cocktail Hour'' is very far removed from yuppiedom, but the hero's primary concern - how to justify his life to his parents - is something that would be immediately recognized by his younger compatriots in the plays by Mr. Greenberg and others.</p>
        <p>Craig Lucas's ''Reckless'' (which closes its run today at the Circle Repertory Company) deals with characters of a similar age, but of a different social standing. They do, however, face related problems such as entrapment by apparent comfort. In this fanciful comedy, a husband takes out a contract on his wife's life (partly because she talks too much) and then warns her of the danger. She leaves home on Christmas Eve in search of sanctuary, self and fulfillment, which is of course also Heidi's aim.</p>
        <p>Last season, in ''Serious Money,'' Caryl Churchill decried the quick-rich life in London's financial world. Howard Korder's ''Boys' Life'' of last spring was a pre-yuppie comedy about rampant young Sybarites who, one assumes, will soon stop the partying and dive into the marketplace.</p>
        <p>More and more films and television programs are also charting the upward - and sometimes immediately downward - mobility of early risers, as in ''Broadcast News,'' ''Wall Street'' and almost anything starring Michael J. Fox (''The Secret of My Success,'' ''Bright Lights, Big City''). One could trace an arc from ''The Graduate'' in 1967 to ''Working Girl'' in 1988 (both Mike Nichols films), marking each as endemic of its time.</p>
        <p>In ''The Graduate,'' Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) is beset by a man boasting of the supremacy of plastics and the young man reacts with irony. Were that movie to be made today, Benjamin might be the head of a plastics empire, edging his elders into early retirement. In ''Working Girl,'' Tess (Melanie Griffiths), as a Cinderella secretary, outwits all suppressive opposition, those who are male, those who are older and, most tellingly, her immediate superior (Sigourney Weaver), who is the same age.</p>
        <p>Ms. Weaver's character is the ultimate yuppie, and, as such, is a sister to Phoebe in ''Eastern Standard,'' although, we are led to believe, Phoebe eventually comes to her senses and realizes the shallowness of her world while Ms. Weaver scurries to get back on the track after her derailment.</p>
        <p>On television, there is ''thirtysomething,'' in which couples try to have it all, and often do, but at great personal expense. Watching these characters try to balance family and career, one thinks of Ms. Wasserstein's Heidi as a new single mother, soon to search for daycare. If she brings the baby to the office, Heidi would turn into Diane Keaton in the movie ''Baby Boom'' (briefly a television situation comedy), in which the simple fact of parenting makes it difficult for a woman to continue as an executive.</p>
        <p>On ''Murphy Brown,'' Candice Bergen plays an anchorwoman still short of fortysomething, but already faced with the threat of obsolescence. In the television studio that is her habitat, she is challenged by an Eve Harrington, who is younger and more ambitious (but not too smart), and a post-adolescent producer in the Michael J. Fox tradition.</p>
        <p>With the exception of ''thirtysomething,'' which takes a more realistic approach, the television shows are lightheaded to the point of being frivolous; a laugh track can certainly mitigate against social concern. In contrast, ''Eastern Standard,'' ''The Heidi Chronicles'' and ''National Anthems'' are witty comedies with a socially redemptive purpose, and each is written from a mature perspective. Avoiding sentimentality and free from a facile resolution, the playwrights treat the Yuppie Trauma with trenchancy. At the end of ''Eastern Standard,'' Stephen toasts his friends and the ''sadly infrequent - accidental - happinesses of all the rest of our lives.'' And in a typical Greenberg coda, the wine they drink turns out to be sour.  yUPPIE'S-eYE vIEW Several new plays this season deal with yuppie life: Richard Greenberg's ''Eastern Standard,'' Wendy Wasserstein's ''Heidi Chronicles'' and Dennis McIntyre's ''National Anthems.'' Here are some samples of dialogue.  EASTERN STANDARD</p>
        <p>PHOEBE: And I loved turning on my computer and sipping coffee from a Styrofoam cup and phoning strangers and telling them what to do with their money and having them believe me. And I loved sometimes working until five in the morning and having a car pick me up and just sort of crumpling into it; and the city would rush by, very lavender and very expensive, but I could afford it, and all the people I knew seemed happy. STEPHEN: But wasn't it just a lot of bad people doing evil things? PHOEBE: I never noticed any of that . . .  THE HEIDI CHRONICLES</p>
        <p>HEIDI: I don't blame the ladies in the locker room for how I feel. I don't blame any of us. We're all concerned, intelligent, good women. It's just that I feel stranded. And I thought the whole point was that we wouldn't feel stranded. I thought the point was we were all in this together.  NATIONAL ANTHEMS</p>
        <p>BEN: Remember those Ataris? If you didn't have an Atari, you didn't invite people over, right? Everybody I knew was putting an Atari on plastic. Two or three if they had kids. Now they're all sitting out in garages, and they're still paying them off, charging VCR's on top of them. That's the great thing about this country - you never get out of debt, but you can always invite people over.</p>
