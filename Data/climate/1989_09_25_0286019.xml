        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''How Fighting Global Warming Could Be Painless and Profitable'' (Week in Review, Sept. 3) makes cogent arguments for energy conservation and reasonable sacrifices. But you miss the mark when you imply that large automobiles are owned primarily as symbols of affluence.</p>
        <p>Safety and comfort aside, some of us require large vehicles because we are large individuals. I am 6 feet tall and relatively long in the legs. In virtually every car less than ''full size'' (with an occasional midsize car being borderline), my knees hit the steering post, making it not only uncomfortable but hazardous to drive. Even full size cars today are getting close to being inadequate. Having recently purchased a down-size full-size car designed with the front wheel well coming into the passenger compartment, I don't have quite enough room for my left leg to be comfortable.</p>
        <p>Soon there may not be a car that I can drive. Perhaps it's time for us tall people to organize and demand our rights to have vehicles suited to our size. Or should we be discriminated against on the basis of our genetic heritage? SEYMOUR HERSCHBERG  Princeton Junction, N.J., Sept. 3, 1989</p>
