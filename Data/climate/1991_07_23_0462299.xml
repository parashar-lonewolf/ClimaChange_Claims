        <p>RATHER than pushing inexorably southward, engulfing northern Africa, the Sahara regularly expands and contracts over large areas, a new study has found.</p>
        <p>"We were shocked by the tremendous shifts," said Dr. Harold E. Dregne, a co-author of the study who is a professor at the International Center for Arid and Semi-Arid Land Studies at Texas Tech University.</p>
        <p>The idea that the desert is steadily expanding has taken hold since geographers took aerial photographs of specific areas in 1916, showing that the desert was moving southward. An estimate often used by the United Nations in recent years suggested that the Sahara was expanding at an average rate of 3 to 12 miles a year. But scientists have long been skeptical, saying there is no evidence to suggest continual expansion.</p>
        <p>In the latest study, scientists used satellite measurements of ground vegetation and rainfall data from 42 points in the desert to measure the extent of the Sahara from 1980 to 1990. The satellites measured the desert during the four-month rainy season, from July to October. The findings were published in the current issue of the journal Science.  Shifts in Desert Movement</p>
        <p>Although the Sahara grew about 7 percent from 1980 to 1990, changes from year to year were so striking that no long-term trends could be determined, the study found. For example, the Sahara grew about 15 percent in just four years, to 3.9 million square miles in 1984 from 3.4 million square miles in 1980. One year later, in 1985, it had shrunk by 282,000 square miles, or nearly 8 percent.</p>
        <p>The study found that in 1990, the southern border of the desert was 79 miles south of its position in 1980, but 66 miles north of its location in 1984.</p>
        <p>"The Sahara ebbs and flows with a great degree of fluctuation," said Dr. Compton J. Tucker, a co-author of the study who is a a physicist at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard center in Greenbelt, Md. "The situation is more complicated than people had assumed."</p>
        <p>Dr. Dregne said, "What this means in human terms is that people who live in this area have very odd variations of rainfall and land vegetation, making it difficult to survive."</p>
        <p>In 1977, the United Nations held a conference to discuss desertification, a process in which natural desert vegetation is lost because of climatic changes, overgrazing and poor use of the land.</p>
        <p>The United Nations published a book, "Rolling Back the Desert," explaining how countries in the northern third of Africa, from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea, could combat the problems of encroachment. Maps were drawn listing 22 countries at risk of being engulfed by the Sahara. One U.N. study tracked the spread of sand dunes in the northern Sudan and said the Sahara moved 60 miles south from 1958 to 1975. But now the U.N. is considering changing its definition of desertification.</p>
        <p>"We recognize that the popular notion that the desert is moving has never been proved," said Henrik S. Marcussen, a United Nations technology adviser for the region. "I don't like the term desertification. It has been used as a selling point when what we really mean is land degradation."</p>
        <p>Scientists have been skeptical that the Sahara is a devouring land mass.  "Most of those claims are poppycock," said Dr. Sharon E. Nicholson, a meteorologist at Florida State University. "The region has been devastated by drought and overgrazing, but it's a huge leap of faith to say that the actual land mass expands."</p>
        <p>The study was financed by NASA as part of a series of studies examining global warming. William W. Newcomb, a physicist at NASA, was also a co-author.</p>
        <p>A group of scientists from the University of Lund in Sweden has reached similar conclusions, also using satellite technology, but did not examine rainfall patterns.</p>
        <p>Dr. Dregne said one interesting finding was that small zones with tremendous rainfall and green vegetation appeared "almost out of nowhere" in between large, barren stretches. "We have no obvious answer to what is going on," he said.</p>
