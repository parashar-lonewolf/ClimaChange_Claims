        <p>LEAD: EVEN as they ponder the implications of the vast hole that opens each year in the protective ozone layer over Antarctica, a major international team of scientists are now focusing new attention to the Arctic, where experts fear the ozone layer may also be developing worrisome gaps.</p>
        <p>EVEN as they ponder the implications of the vast hole that opens each year in the protective ozone layer over Antarctica, a major international team of scientists are now focusing new attention to the Arctic, where experts fear the ozone layer may also be developing worrisome gaps.</p>
        <p>Last February and March, scientists found the first disturbing indications that an ozone hole develops each year over the Arctic. The findings suggested a possible new threat to the health of people and wildlife in the Arctic. They also indicated that industrial pollutants may be causing drastic, if temporary, declines in ozone on a wider scale than experts had expected.</p>
        <p>Scientists hope that better information about the extreme seasonal declines in ozone around the earth's poles will also improve the understanding of the more gradual depletion of ozone worldwide as pollutants accumulate in the stratosphere.</p>
        <p>For 45 days beginning on Jan. 1, more than 100 American scientists operating from Stavanger, Norway, and Ellesmere Island, Canada, will study the chemistry of the stratosphere above the Arctic. They will use airplanes, balloons, ground stations and the Nimbus-7 research satellite to collect data and air samples.</p>
        <p>At the same time, scientists in the Soviet Union plan to conduct measurements and observations of their own, using aircraft and ground stations in northern Siberia and Franz Josef Land, a cluster of islands and pack ice in the Arctic Ocean north of Novaya Zemlya.</p>
        <p>Ozone in the stratosphere constitutes a natural shield protecting living beings from the sun's potentially lethal ultraviolet radiation. Fears have mounted in recent years that pollution is causing so much damage to the ozone layer that it endangers human health, causing an increase in skin cancer and eye damage, and inflicting damage to many plant and animal species. Some experts believe that increased exposure to high-energy ultraviolet radiation from the sun may be endangering marine animals essential to the global food chain.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mark Schoeberl, an atmospheric scientist at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Space Center, said the Arctic measurements would closely parallel a broad investigation conducted in Antarctica last year. He said the Antarctic study had been ''wildly successful'' in mapping and interpreting the huge hole in the ozone layer that has begun to appear over Antarctica for about two months each year.</p>
        <p>What remains to be determined is whether similar zones of extreme ozone depletion are developing elsewhere. Scientists believe that many of the same conditions - a combination of winds, light and temperature - that cause the Antarctic hole may also be occurring around the North Pole, though perhaps on a less intense scale.</p>
        <p>The possibility that gaps in the ozone layer may be opening in the relatively populous Arctic regions of Canada, Scandinavia and the Soviet Union, and perhaps even over temperate regions of the globe, has heightened fears by scientists that human beings and wildlife may soon face grave health hazards.</p>
        <p>International concern over the problem led to the signing, in Montreal last year, of a treaty calling for reduced use of the industrial chemicals believed to destroy ozone. More recently, senior United States officials have asserted that this may be inadequate and that production of such chemicals may have to be eliminated entirely.</p>
        <p>Ozone is a compound in which three oxygen atoms are bound together. It is formed in the stratosphere when intense ultraviolet radiation from the sun splits ordinary oxygen molecules, consisting of two oxygen atoms, into their highly reactive individual atoms. Most of the single atoms quickly recombine as ordinary oxygen gas, but some join together as triplets to form ozone.</p>
        <p>In 1974 scientists suggested a mechanism that might result in the depletion of ozone by man-made chemicals. Dr. F. Sherwood Rowland of the University of California at Irvine and Dr. Mario J. Molina, now of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, concluded from experiments and theoretical calculations that compounds called chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, would eventually rise from the ground and destroy ozone in the stratosphere.</p>
        <p>Moreover, they concluded that the chlorine involved in the reaction could react over and over again, so that a single CFC molecule could destroy tens or hundreds of thousands of molecules of ozone.</p>
        <p>In 1982, the British Antarctic Survey at Halley Bay, Antarctica, which had been observing the Antarctic stratosphere since 1957, discovered that an immense hole had suddenly developed in the ozone layer high above the Antarctic continent. This dramatic evidence supporting Dr. Rowland's and Dr. Molina's hypothesis caught atmospheric scientists completely by surprise.</p>
        <p>The hole, which developed within a region of cold, stagnant air bounded by a continent-sized vortex of wind, broke up after about six weeks, and its ozone-deficient air mixed rapidly with the surrounding atmosphere. The net effect, scientists believe, was to exacerbate the more gradual reduction believed to be occurring in the ozone of the entire stratosphere because the of the buildup of ozone-destroying chemicals. Clouds of Ice Crystals</p>
        <p>A Federal Ozone Trends Panel reported this year that global stratospheric ozone was depleted by as much as 3 percent from 1969 to 1986, and that ozone levels continue to decline.</p>
        <p>Scientists at NASA, the National Science Foundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other American institutions participating in the Arctic investigation believe that both sunlight and stratospheric clouds of ice crystals are essential to the processes by which chlorine-based chemicals rapidly destroy ozone.</p>
        <p>The most important of the chemicals involved are the chlorofluorocarbons, relatively non-reactive gases used as refrigerants in air conditioners and refrigerators, as propellants in aerosol sprays, as foaming agents in foam plastics, and as cleaning agents for computer circuit boards. Also covered in the Montreal treaty are Halons, chemicals used in fire extinguishers.</p>
        <p>All the chemical reactions that destroy the ozone shield take place in the stratosphere, which begins about 43,000 feet above the earth's surface. In the troposphere, which extends from the ground to the stratosphere, air temperatures steadily decline with increasing altitude to a minimum of about minus 70 degrees Fahrenheit at the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere. But above this boundary, air temperatures rise with increasing altitude and reach a springlike maximum of about 59 degrees at an altitude of 27 miles. Riding on Air Currents</p>
        <p>The atmospheric conditions in the stratosphere and troposphere are so dissimilar, scientists say, that very little mixing or interaction occurs between them. But chemicals that do move between the two layers include the chlorofluorocarbons, which are so chemically unreactive they can survive in the troposphere for more than a century. Within only five years they are able to drift upward into the stratosphere, where they are exposed to intense ultraviolet radiation.</p>
        <p>Ultraviolet radiation breaks these molecules apart, but scientists are not certain exactly what happens next. According to Dr. Richard R. Stolarski of NASA, the products of the decomposition include ''reservoir'' compounds that do not directly destroy ozone but are precursors of the ozone killers.</p>
        <p>Global winds circling the earth tend to move air from the equatorial region toward the North and South Poles, and these winds carry the chlorine-bearing reservoir compounds with them.</p>
        <p>During the cold, sunless winters of the polar regions, large-scale cyclonic wind systems called stratosphereic vortices, form in the atmosphere over the poles, and temperatures within these vortices may fall below minus 117 degrees. Sometimes clouds of microscopic ice crystals form in the stratosphere within the polar vortices, and these polar stratospheric clouds have become the main focus for the scientists investigating ozone destruction.</p>
        <p>Chemical reactions that might take place only very slowly in a simple mixture of gases can occur much more rapidly when the gases are exposed to sunlight and in contact with the kind of crystalline surface provided by the particles in polar ice clouds. Chlorine Survives Unscathed</p>
        <p>Researchers believe that at the first appearance of the sun over Antarctica in early September, spring in the southern hemisphere, the chlorine-bearing reservoir compounds in contact with ozone molecules on the surfaces of ice crystals begin to react.</p>
        <p>In one of the reactions believed to take place, a single atom of chlorine reacts with a molecule of ozone to create a molecule of chlorine monoxide and a molecule of oxygen. In a second reaction, a molecule of chlorine monoxide reacts with a single atom of oxygen to yield a single atom of chlorine and an oxygen molecule. The net result of these reactions, occurring at different rates, is that chlorine, sunlight and an ice crystal surface force the stepwise transformation of two molecules of ozone into three molecules of ordinary oxygen. The chlorine survives unscathed, ready to attack more ozone.</p>
        <p>But other chemical substances may enter into a very complex mixture of ozone-destroying reactions, and scientists acknowledge that their investigations have barely scratched the surface. For example, some scientists believe that bromine released into the stratosphere by the use of Halon-type fire extinguishers may be hastening the ozone depletion rate by aiding chlorine reactions.</p>
        <p>''The problem,'' said Dr. Molina of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, ''is that we cannot predict on the basis of any theory what the interactions between different ozone-depleting mechanisms will be. We have to depend on actual experiments, analyses and measurements.'' Looking Up and Down</p>
        <p>''Our work in the Arctic this year,'' Dr. Stolarski said, ''will focus on the polar stratospheric cloud, if and when it develops. We want to know what chemicals go into the cloud, how they are processed inside the cloud, and what comes out.''</p>
        <p>A network of ground-based spectrometers in Canada, Scandinavia and the Soviet Union will analyze the chemical components of the atmosphere above them by measuring the modifications these chemicals cause in the natural spectrum of sunlight.</p>
        <p>Similar instruments aboard a NASA research plane will look up through the atmosphere from a higher altitude, and instruments on the Nimbus-7 satellite will look down to analyze reflected sunlight. These measurements will gauge not only the extent of ozone depletion over the Arctic, but other chemical changes in the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, a NASA ER-2 research aircraft, a modified U-2 spy plane, will attempt to fly into the Arctic stratospheric ice cloud at an altitude of about 65,000 feet, when and if the ice cloud forms. The aircraft is equipped not only to collect samples but to instantly analyze the air through which it passes for short-lived chemicals, especially chlorine monoxide. Cyclic Nature of Depletion</p>
        <p>''Data from the satellite will help to guide us in spotting the vortex and the ice cloud,'' Dr. Schoeberl said. ''But the vortex may be small and irregularly shaped, and it may wander over Soviet territory where our aircraft cannot follow it.''</p>
        <p>Theorists believe, moreover, that the intensity of conditions leading to ozone depletion is cyclic, and that conditions in the Arctic this year will be less extreme than last year. ''It's possible that temperatures in the Arctic will remain too high this winter for the ice cloud to form at all,'' Dr. Stolarski said. ''In that case, we will consider repeating the Arctic program the following year.''</p>
