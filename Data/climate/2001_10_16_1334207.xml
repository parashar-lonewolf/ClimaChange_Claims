        <p>Have Seeds, Will Travel</p>
        <p>A plant community is like a house of cards -- remove one element and the whole thing can easily fall apart.</p>
        <p>Take the spreading of seeds, for instance. Plants can't carry their seeds elsewhere, so they often rely for dispersal on animals or insects (who get something out of the relationship as well -- usually a food source). If you remove a seed disperser, the results could be disastrous for a plant community.</p>
        <p>That's been the theory, at least, but it's been supported only by anecdotal evidence. Now, however, a researcher at the University of California at Davis has conducted a rigorous study that backs the theory. Writing in Nature, she found that the elimination of several seed-dispersing ant species has altered the makeup of a plant community.</p>
        <p>The researcher, Caroline E. Christian, studied the fynbos shrubland of the Western Cape region of South Africa. About one-third of the thousands of plant species in the region rely for seed dispersal on ants, which carry the seeds underground and eat only the elaiosomes, fat-rich appendages on the seeds. Dispersing them this way keeps the seeds away from rodents and safe from fire.</p>
        <p>Ms. Christian studied four ant species. All dispersed smaller seeds equally well, but two accounted for most of the dispersal of larger seeds. It happens that these two species are also the most affected by a fifth species, the Argentine ant, which has invaded the fynbos region in recent years.</p>
        <p>Argentine ants do no dispersing of seeds at all, and since they were displacing the large-seed-dispersing ants, the invasion should have reduced the abundance of large-seed plants (as more seeds were eaten by animals or destroyed by fire). This is exactly what Ms. Christian found. The findings, she suggests, show that preserving such mutually beneficial relationships is essential for the health of plant communities.</p>
        <p>A Coffee Break for Soil</p>
        <p>One of the ways coffee roasters decaffeinate their beans is through a process called supercritical fluid extraction. In this method, carbon dioxide under high heat and pressure is pumped through the beans. The carbon dioxide becomes supercritical, with both gas- and liquid-like characteristics. So, it can diffuse through the beans like a gas, and dissolve the caffeine like a liquid.</p>
        <p>What's good for Chock Full o' Nuts may also be good for soil that's chock full o' plutonium. Researchers at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, a division of the Department of Energy, have experimented with a way to clean up radioactive soils using basically the same extraction process.</p>
        <p>The researchers, whose work was reported in the journal Radiochimica Acta, mixed the carbon dioxide with soil that had been spiked with plutonium and americum. Carbon dioxide may be able to dissolve caffeine, but it can't dissolve radioactive elements, so a compound was added to it that would bind with the plutonium and americum, removing them from the soil.</p>
        <p>The researchers say much more work needs to be done to develop the process, but it is a promising one for cleaning up contaminated weapons factories and research labs. For one thing, the process leaves the soil intact. Other techniques tend to destroy the soil structure, leaving a sludge behind.</p>
        <p>6,000 Flags Flying High</p>
        <p>Piloted space missions often carry flags, souvenirs and other mementos along for the ride to commemorate some terrestrial event or achievement. But a mission has never carried a cargo quite like the one scheduled for a space shuttle flight next month: about 6,000 American flags.</p>
        <p>The flags will be carried aboard the Endeavour, scheduled to lift off on Nov. 29 for a trip to the International Space Station, and returned to Earth for distribution to families of the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks.</p>
