        <p>The scene in the ballroom on Tuesday resembled 100 other Howard Dean rallies, a blanket of blue ''Doctor Is In'' placards dotted with the green, black and purple of the unions backing him. But instead of a phalanx of youngsters in Dean for America T-shirts, the stage held just Dr. Dean and Al Gore, their fists flung skyward in the traditional politicians' pose of triumph.</p>
        <p>As Dr. Dean wound up his introduction of his newest, best-known supporter here, a shout of ''Big Al'' came from the crowd. Dr. Dean smirked his trademark smirk and explained, ''It's a two-way campaign, Mr. Vice President.''</p>
        <p>That was the most surprising and defining image yet in the crowded campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, which has failed to grab the public's attention. After months of attacking the status quo in Washington and his party's leadership as weak in the spine, Dr. Dean, the former governor of Vermont, has teamed up with a lifelong Beltway hand who, as the 2000 nominee, carried Democrats to a particularly bitter defeat.</p>
        <p>Wearing dark gray suits and ties of a nearly identical periwinkle hue, the two men said, in twin appearances here and in Harlem, that their partnership was forged through fierce opposition to the Iraq conflict and a fervent desire to unseat President Bush.</p>
        <p>''I have come to the conclusion that among all of the candidates, Howard Dean and you have managed to do a better job of igniting enthusiasm at the grass roots all across the United States of America,'' Mr. Gore told the crowd, adopting Dr. Dean's language and emphasizing supporters' ownership of the campaign. ''And that's what we need to rebuild the Democratic Party and to rebuild America.''</p>
        <p>Describing the nine-candidate field as ''great'' and saying, ''I don't think the stakes have ever been as high in our lifetime,'' Mr. Gore urged Democrats to halt infighting and ''close ranks'' around a candidate -- the one smiling behind him -- whom he later praised as ''the only major candidate who was right'' about Iraq.</p>
        <p>''I'm just one person and I have one vote,'' Mr. Gore said. ''I'm blessed with a lot of friends, and I want to do everything I can to convince my friends and anybody who is interested in what I have to say about this race that they ought to be for Howard.''</p>
        <p>Earlier, at the Institute of Action Art of the National Black Theater Institute on Fifth Avenue at 125th Street, Mr. Gore said: ''Democracy is a team sport. We don't have the luxury of fighting among ourselves to the point where we seriously damage our ability to win.'' And in an e-mail message to supporters, he wrote, ''While you may already be supporting another candidate, it is my fervent hope that we as a party can keep our eyes on the prize and unite behind the man I believe is our best hope, Howard Dean.''</p>
        <p>The endorsement reinserts Mr. Gore into a race he was reluctant to abandon, becoming the senior backstage adviser and the highest-profile headliner in a seemingly unstoppable campaign that has dominated news coverage. For Dr. Dean, it is an ultimate insider's stamp to complement the intensity of his insurgency.</p>
        <p>The appearance in Harlem, which aides insisted was a coincidence based on the two men's schedules, highlighted another potential benefit. Dr. Dean has won important endorsements from black politicians but not yet attracted African-American voters in great numbers, while Mr. Gore overwhelmingly won the black vote in 2000.</p>
        <p>''It's great to be back in Harlem,'' Mr. Gore said, noting that he shot hoops on his last visit.</p>
        <p>Dr. Dean, vowing to focus on the base, including blacks, Hispanics, women and unionists, said, ''I think it's important that we start in Harlem.''</p>
        <p>Within hours of the endorsement becoming public on Monday, according to Dr. Dean's campaign manager, Joe Trippi, 15 to 20 members of Congress indicated their readiness to join the fold. Traffic on the campaign's Web log hit a record, at 30 comments a minute, and Internet contributions intended as ''thank you's'' to Mr. Gore reached $183,173.50 by 7 p.m.</p>
        <p>And as they flew from the airport in Teterboro, N.J., to Iowa Mr. Gore gave Dr. Dean an extensive PowerPoint briefing on global warming, his pet issue, as well as some been-there, done-that strategy tips for the trail.</p>
        <p>''The value of this endorsement,'' Dr. Dean said, ''is that Al Gore brings his extraordinary experience, his moral leadership and his deep thought about issues -- which happen to be very similar to my views on issues -- to a campaign that is doing very well already.''</p>
        <p>Aides to both men said it was unclear precisely what Mr. Gore would do for the campaign or whether he would use his political action committee to buttress its treasury. His wife, Tipper, and daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, who were major figures in 2000, are likely to hit the trail for Dr. Dean, they said.</p>
        <p>Rival Democrats were quick to complain that Mr. Gore failed even to win his own state, Tennessee, in 2000; has been roundly denounced for a wooden personality and a weak, overly cautious campaign; and never developed the star power of his partner, President Bill Clinton.</p>
        <p>Bill Carrick, an adviser to Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, a hopeful, said: ''Is this going to change any votes? Only on the margins. The Dean game is to try to say -- before the voters get going, before anybody reaches any judgment in a polling booth -- he's trying to say it's really over. I've got news for him. The voters are going to say when it's over.''</p>
        <p>Even Dr. Dean, in his twin appearances, spent little time singing praises of the Clinton-Gore years or the 2000 campaign, instead simply tacking on an ode to Mr. Gore's service -- in the military, as well as in Congress and as vice president -- at the end of his routine remarks.</p>
        <p>The war drew the most passionate comments from Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>''That war it is not a minor matter to me,'' Mr. Gore said here, veritably barking each word. ''I realize it's only one of the issues, but my friends this nation has never, in two centuries and more, made a worse foreign policy mistake. The only major candidate for the nomination of my party that had the good judgment, experience and good sense to feel and see and articulate the right choice was Howard Dean.''</p>
        <p>Mike Taylor, a retired postal worker who was among the sign wavers, walked out saying, ''It's a wrap.''</p>
        <p>After a strange day of top-secret planning on Monday that ended, against Mr. Gore's wishes, with the endorsement leading newscasts and on newspaper front pages, Dr. Dean and Mr. Gore embraced on Tuesday morning in a private room in the Harlem theater after a long-scheduled $125-a-plate breakfast.</p>
        <p>Dr. Dean told supporters, who were outnumbered by journalists, ''When we set this up, I had absolutely no idea we were going to have the elected president of the United States here.''</p>
        <p>They spoke for 15 minutes before being whisked off to a private jet. In Cedar Rapids, selected because it was at the heart of Mr. Gore's strongest showing in the 2000 caucuses, devout Dean supporters had been assembled in 24 hours with fliers and phone banks.</p>
        <p>Instead of the campaign theme ''We Can,'' the men entered the ballroom to a remixed Elvis tune, ''A Little Less Conversation.'' The speeches lasted 25 minutes. Dr. Dean graced the press for less than five minutes, while Mr. Gore took nary a question before scooting off, on a fourth Dean-chartered plane, to Chicago to catch a flight to Sweden.</p>
