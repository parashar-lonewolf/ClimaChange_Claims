        <p>As baseball's All-Star break winds up today, let us put on our thinking caps, with the bills worn frontward, backward or off to the side, rapper style. Let us ponder why 7 out of 10 hats made in this country are baseball caps. Why everyone from football and basketball coaches to movie stars and babies wear them. And why the trend shows no sign of peaking.</p>
        <p>Baseball intellectuals will give you a metaphysical answer. But before talking about the cap, they must talk about the game. For them, a baseball cap, any baseball cap, is a magical object invested with unspoken powers because of its link to the mythic activity called baseball. Dr. Stuart Ewen, a professor of media studies at City University of New York, whose cap collection includes minor league teams like the Madison Muskies, is one such intellectual.</p>

        <p>As baseball's All-Star break winds up today, let us put on our thinking caps, with the bills worn frontward, backward or off to the side, rapper style. Let us ponder why 7 out of 10 hats made in this country are baseball caps. Why everyone from football and basketball coaches to movie stars and babies wear them. And why the trend shows no sign of peaking.</p>
        <p>Baseball intellectuals will give you a metaphysical answer. But before talking about the cap, they must talk about the game. For them, a baseball cap, any baseball cap, is a magical object invested with unspoken powers because of its link to the mythic activity called baseball. Dr. Stuart Ewen, a professor of media studies at City University of New York, whose cap collection includes minor league teams like the Madison Muskies, is one such intellectual.</p>
        <p>"Baseball as a game rejects the rule of the clock," he said. "There's a kind of loveable defiance about wearing a baseball cap. It's become common for straitlaced business people to put on baseball caps as a sign of knocking off, time away from work."</p>
        <p>New York seems especially nuts about baseball caps this summer. Not just Mets and Yankees caps, but baseball caps for basketball and football teams. Baseball caps that say Public Enemy, Smithsonian, U.S.S. Kennedy, Ninja Turtles and Abe Stark Senior Center. And baseball caps that say nothing at all. The cap itself is its own statement.</p>
        <p>Baseball caps are the new T-shirts. You wear them to show allegiance to your team, school, town, rock band and fishing club. Or that of someone else. A transplanted North Carolinian, James Pruden, stumbled on an essential truth of New York cap fashion in Times Square the other day when, bobbing in a sea of heads, he beheld caps of the Charlotte Hornets, blue with orange and white letters.</p>
        <p>"You don't see that many Hornets hats in downtown Winston-Salem," he said. So he stopped the wearers and asked, "You're from North Carolina?"</p>
        <p>No, they said, but the sun had them squinting and some street vendor pushed these particular caps for $3, instead of the usual $5 to $10. And what were the Hornets, anyway? "Basketball," Mr. Pruden replied, wistfully.</p>
        <p>Baseball caps are also the new teddy bears. Hospital gift shops stock them, and cancer patients, especially young ones, use them to hide the hair loss caused by chemotherapy. Toni Cabat, a social worker at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, tells of the boy who lived in a baseball cap.</p>
        <p>"He opened the door one day and there were all the neighborhood kids in the same cap," she said. "He had a team."</p>
        <p>Baseball caps are high fashion. They became street fashion when the uptown rap artists took the venerable symbol of youth and summer, worked it off to the side, to the back and literally turned it on its head. Meanwhile, the downtown fashion crowd added the cap to their uniform of white T-shirts, cutoffs and sneakers. Boutiques began selling caps with sequins and bugle beads. Street vendors hawked leather caps with fake logos of Chanel, Vuitton and Gucci for about $18.</p>
        <p>This season the caps moved from home plate to fashion plate, walking down the runways of Seventh Avenue and Paris. At the Chanel Boutique in Manhattan, baseball caps of quilted black leather are $810.</p>
        <p>If none of this seems to have much to do with professional sports, in a way it doesn't.</p>
        <p>"Probably no more than 10 percent of the domestic baseball cap volume represents pro caps licensed by the N.F.L., N.B.A., N.H.L. and the major- league ball clubs," said C. Leon Sherman of CLS Associates , a Denver company that is a consultant to the headwear industry.</p>
        <p>Roughly 250 million to 300 million baseball caps were made in the United States last year, Mr. Sherman said, adding that imports from China, Taiwan and South Korea probably accounted for an equal number.</p>
        <p>"Close to 50 percent of caps sold are premiums and promotions for everything from seed and feed companies to fast-food restaurants and amusement parks," he said. "You name it, they're wearing it."</p>
        <p>Or collecting it.</p>
        <p>"Look in any closet," he said. "You'll probably find a dozen caps. They're displayed on walls and on special baseball cap racks. Drive along the highway and you'll see them lined up along the back windows of automobiles."</p>
        <p>Seventy percent of all hats sold in the United States are baseball caps, said Susan Tildesley, director of the Headwear Institute of America, a trade group. "Caps are having another record season," she said. The institute estimates that sales of all hats will reach $2.2 billion this year, an increase of 10 percent over last year's sales.</p>
        <p>Part of baseball caps' appeal, she said, is that "they're unisex, they're cheap -- mostly between $5 and $20 -- and they're being made in every material: polyester, cotton, wool, corduroy, suede, even silk."</p>
        <p>Ms. Tildesley added: "Baby boomers are having fun with the caps. Their fathers wore hats. And don't forget the ozone layer. Fear of the sun plays a big part in this."</p>
        <p>Smiling under a Yankees cap, Judith Fugate, a principal dancer with the New York City Ballet, agreed.</p>
        <p>"The cap keeps the sun off my face and when it rains the visor is my umbrella," she said. "A lot of dancers wear baseball caps, actually. It's a huge fashion statement."</p>
        <p>As John Perez, who wears a black and silver Los Angeles Raiders cap to work at a discount store in Greenwich Village, put it: "It's the look. The Raiders hat, the big pants, the big shoes."</p>
        <p>Pete Hisey, who reports on consumer electronics for a trade publication, said: "There's definitely something Peter Pan-ish about it. It's the same reason baseball cards are so popular now -- a connection to when you were a kid."</p>
        <p>Mr. Hisey pushed a stroller in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn as he spoke. His 1-year-old daughter, Kathleen, was going along for the ride. Kathleen sported a Little Slugger cap, bill to the back. Her father wore a neon-pink cap from a rechargeable battery company. Emblazoned with lighting bolts, it read MILLENNIUM.</p>
        <p>"I hear they're selling baseball caps now with fake ponytails attached," Mr. Hisey said, "for bald guys or guys whose jobs won't let them have long hair. It's a way of looking a little radical at night."</p>
        <p>Or going Hollywood. All the film directors, gaffers and production people wear baseball caps. It must be mandatory.</p>
        <p>"And the stars," said Ms. Tildesley of the Headwear Institute. "They really helped popularize the baseball cap."</p>
        <p>She mentioned Tom Selleck, who wore a Detroit Tigers cap on the television show "Magnum P.I." She also mentioned Madonna, who danced in a black baseball cap with the word BOY in mirrored letters, and who jogged through Central Park in an assortment of other caps. And of course there's Spike Lee, whose old Brooklyn Dodgers cap inspired the vogue for vintage baseball caps.</p>
        <p>Billy Crystal does a lot for the cap in his new movie, "City Slickers." He plays one of three urban dudes who go on a cattle drive. The others wear cowboy hats, but he clings to his Yankee cap, a security blanket in an alien place.</p>
        <p>Here, the baseball cap is a pop-culture code for the new man.</p>
        <p>"Historically, baseball caps have been very masculine, but they're not about machismo," said Dr. Ewen of City University, author of "All Consuming Images: The Politics of Style in Contemporary Culture," (Basic Books). "They embody a vision of manhood that is really about boyishness and the exuberance of youth.</p>
        <p>"When Billy Crystal and other new-man images in movies wear baseball caps it means they're goofy and lovable. But in no way does that goofiness and lovableness call into question their masculinity."</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 12, 1991, Friday</p>
        <p>An article in The Living Section on Wednesday about the popularity of baseball caps incorrectly described Billy Crystal's attire in the movie "City Slickers." He wears a Mets cap, not a Yankees cap.</p>
