        <p>A CONSTRUCTION and restoration program costing $12 million is under way at the Greenwich Audubon Society, whose main 500-acre sanctuary of rolling woodlands offers peaceful precincts for visitors seeking a respite from the madding crowd. The project will transform some of the beloved but outmoded components of the half-century-old preserve into a state-of-the-art environmental education center and nature sanctuary, scheduled to open early in 2003.</p>
        <p>''Our vision,'' said Thomas Baptist, executive director of the Greenwich property and director of four other Audubon centers in the state, ''is to restore areas degraded by human activity and in the process demonstrate what people can do in their own backyards to enhance ecological quality.''</p>
        <p>A study by the Department of the Interior indicating that younger generations are not frequent visitors to nature centers was an impetus to improve programs for children, he said, ''providing them with opportunities for critical examinations of nature that heighten their senses of touch, sight and smell.'' He added, ''We can help them develop the problem solving skills they will need in future -- skills that cannot be replicated indoors in a museum or classroom.''</p>
        <p>Because activity is currently concentrated on only 30 acres lying close to the entrance at Riversville Road and John Street, while some 15 miles of trails into the depths of the property do not command much attention from visitors, he added, ''we need to promote the entire sanctuary.''</p>
        <p>To that end several improvements are being made. A 200-year-old orchard sprang to new life last summer when 58 Macintosh, Liberty and Granny Smith apple trees were planted to replace those long gone. ''Miraculously, we still get some Mac types from the old trees,'' Mr. Baptist said.</p>
        <p>Then there is Indian Spring Pond, filled in with materials excavated during construction of the 1958 teacher-training building, which is now being demolished. It was dredged and restored for water's-edge study of the resident frogs, salamanders, turtles, insects and wetland plants that have returned and are thriving.</p>
        <p>Mead Lake, far into the property and dotted with water lilies, has two bird blinds where up to 10 people can peer into the secrets of wildlife. Because of the timidity of otters in the Byram River that flows through the sanctuary, and the difficulty of sighting wild turkeys, great horned owls, bobcats and other wildlife, the new education-center building will show live videos of their activities from hidden cameras, beamed into a room where people can watch without disturbing the shyest of creatures.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baptist was the conservation director for the town of Greenwich for 19 years before joining the Audubon Center in 1997. ''He's put a lot of energy, drive and intelligence into this project,'' said Kevin Kimberlin, chairman of Spencer Trask &amp; Company in Manhattan, which finances new technologies. With his wife, Joni, and their two children, Mr. Kimberlin has lived in Greenwich since 1989 and is a major contributor to the Audubon restoration.</p>
        <p>''It's important to get kids out into the woods,'' he said, ''to deal with the incredible natural world that they are getting more and more separated from.''</p>
        <p>AT the groundbreaking in September for the new main building, to be called the Kimberlin Nature Education Center, Mr. Kimberlin cited the failure of American schools to educate children in the fundamentals of science, particularly science grounded in nature. ''Our high school seniors ranked 15th out of 16 countries in math, which is the language of science, and dead last in physics, the most fundamental of all sciences,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The new building, designed by Shope Reno Wharton Associates of Greenwich, will be erected on the 5,000-square-foot footprint of the teacher-training and dormitory building that is being dismantled. But the new three-story structure will contain 15,000 square feet of interior space, compared with the existing 5,000 square feet.</p>
        <p>''A building to be used by families, children, teachers, scientists and researchers has to have a lot of multipurpose spaces,'' said the architect, Allan Shope. He chose shingle style architecture, he said, because ''it's informal, soft, inviting. It lets you do a lot of things with it.''</p>
        <p>The center will be heated and cooled by a geothermal system, he noted, ''setting an example that can be followed for homes. The world has gotten used to heating with fossil fuels. That's not smart, when we can use the temperature of the earth and heat pumps.'' The geothermal system will use water cooled underground in summer and heated by a heat pump in winter. The installation costs, $150,000, are expected to be recouped in seven years through the elimination of conventional fuel costs.</p>
        <p>Dozens of trees that were cut down recently to allow overgrown meadows to repair themselves have been milled into stacks of floorboards, posts, railings and beams. Mr. Shope uses a myriad of products made from environmentally sound materials, including synthetic window glass and mullions, eco-friendly paints and light bulbs and glass bottles morphed into bathroom tiles.</p>
        <p>To increase absorption of water into the ground, paved interior roads will be replaced with gravel, and parking will be on concrete pavers that support the weight of cars but allow grass to grow through several holes, maturing into a mowable lawn. On a slope below a newly completed maintenance building, a 65-foot-long, 4-foot-deep trench, called a biofilter, has been dug and seeded with wetland plants that filter out pollutants. Rainwater piped to it from gutters and culverts leaches into the ground rather than running off downhill, leaving the upland dry.</p>
        <p>THE Greenwich Audubon Society was established by the National Audubon Society as its first such center in the country. It grew from 281 acres of the 1746 Zebediah Mead Farm, purchased in 1942 by Eleanor and H. Hall Clovis and donated to Audubon. The original farmhouse is occupied by Mr. Baptist and his family, while two antique barns are still in use, one as a meeting and dining hall and the other as exhibition space, offices and gift shop. The latter building also houses an indoor bird-watching station replete with a powerful telescope and binoculars, 24 pictures and text on local birds, and a copy of Roger Tory Peterson's Field Guide to the Birds. The bird station will be moved to the new building and expanded.</p>
        <p>In the 1940's the expanse of woods, fields and waterways was dwarfed by the enormous private estates that abutted it. Today, still surrounded by expensive real estate, the Audubon Center is the largest landowner in Greenwich except for the town itself, thanks to donations and purchases of land that became available as the old farms and estates were parceled off. In terms of acreage, it is the largest Audubon chapter in the state. Almost 500 acres are concentrated at the Riversville Road site; additional land bringing the total to 686 acres are scattered around town in small parcels.</p>
        <p>To the confusion of many people, there are two Audubon organizations. In 1898 the Connecticut Audubon Society was organized in the town of Fairfield by Mabel Osgood Wright, who established the nation's first bird sanctuary on Burr Street as a protest against the slaughter of birds for the feathers women prized on hats. It is now a National Historic Landmark called the Birdcraft Museum, part of the 160-acre Connecticut Audubon Center in Fairfield.</p>
        <p>Over the years additional centers affiliated with Connecticut Audubon independent of the National Audubon formed at Milford Point, Glastonbury, Pomfret and Hampton, and 19 small properties were acquired around the state, consisting of trails without centers. They contain 2,200 acres.</p>
        <p>Besides the Greenwich property, the National Audubon Society owns centers in Guilford, Sharon, Southbury and Roxbury; its properties have a total of about 4,000 acres.</p>
        <p>According to officials of both Audubons, preliminary consideration of consolidation is under way. As it is, they are both involved in advocacy for open space and conservation at state and local levels, and they cooperate in addressing issues of mutual concern. For such a small state, Connecticut has an unusually large number of local nature centers in addition to the Audubon properties. John Horkel, director of Westport's 62-acre Nature Center for Environmental Activity, said: ''I believe we each have our own niche. There is commonality and there is uniqueness among small community-based nature centers like ours.</p>
        <p>''People are seeing a loss of open space and the need to hold onto what we have. At the bottom line we sense a disconnect between ourselves and the natural world. The information age makes for a busy, complex life. We're seeing people value breathing the outdoors, seeing some wildlife, being in a quiet place. Having it close to home makes its impact greater.</p>
        <p>''Now,'' he said, ''with the push to keep travel to a minimum we are getting calls from New York for directions.''</p>
