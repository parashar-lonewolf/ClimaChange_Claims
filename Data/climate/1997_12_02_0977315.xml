        <p>South Korea Resistance Delays I.M.F. Agreement  The Government of South Korea backtracked and reopened negotiations over a bailout plan for its economy after having announced a day earlier that an agreement had been reached.</p>
        <p>The International Monetary Fund has demanded the closure of insolvent banks and other strong steps. By this morning, all three South Korean television networks were reporting that the Government had partly capitulated on some bank closures. But South Korea's stocks and currency fell sharply again. [Page A1.]</p>
        <p>The United States is prepared to contribute to the bailout of South Korea, but only if the South Korean Government agrees to the economic changes demanded by the International Monetary Fund, President Clinton said. [D4.]</p>
        <p>Finance ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations endorsed a plan that gives the I.M.F. the leading role in future Asian financial crises. [D5.]</p>
        <p>Manufacturing Pace Slows  A closely followed report by American factory purchasing executives showed manufacturing slowed in November, fresh evidence of a cooling economy. The National Association of Purchasing Management's index has fallen for three of the past four months after reaching a two-and-a-half-year high in July. [D2.]</p>
        <p>Treasury prices rose after the National Association of Purchasing Management's report. The bond's yield fell to 6.04 percent, from 6.05 percent. [D10.]</p>
        <p>F.T.C. Sticks to Its Standards  The Federal Trade Commission decided to preserve a standard a half-century old that requires a product to be ''all or virtually all'' made in the United States to be labeled as such, a standard often interpreted to mean 98 percent of a product's value. [A1.]</p>
        <p>Fight Looms Over Pensions  Retirement advocates warned that a Labor Department plan seriously threatens pension fund accountability. Under the plan, large pension funds would no longer be required to disclose their assets annually. [D2.]</p>
        <p>Iraqi Oil Compromise Offered  United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan has recommended that the Security Council consider increasing the amount of oil Iraq may sell in return for food and medicine, but he stopped short of proposing a specific figure. The Security Council is expected to maintain current Iraqi oil export levels of $2.1 billion every six months with a promise to consider increases in the future. [A13.]</p>
        <p>Crude oil prices fell sharply on the action by the Secretary General and the decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to raise its output ceiling to 27.5 million barrels a day from 25.033 million. On other markets, coffee prices jumped. [D19.]</p>
        <p>Global Warming Talks Begin  After more than two years of bargaining, delegates from 150 countries are meeting in Kyoto, Japan, for nine days of talks on what to do about global warming. [A10.]</p>
        <p>Workers Are in Short Supply  There is a shortage of workers in the New York metropolitan area, but it is scattered, concentrated in pockets by industry, geography and skill level. [A1.]</p>
        <p>Dollar Surges vs. Yen</p>
        <p>The dollar surged to its highest level in five and a half years against the yen on speculation that Japan might not do enough to bail out ailing banks and securities firms. The dollar closed at 128.91 yen, up from 127.82 yen on Friday. The dollar rose to 1.7771 marks, from 1.7645 marks. [D19.]</p>
