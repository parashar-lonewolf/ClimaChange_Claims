        <p>There hasn't been a rainy day, much less a foggy one, in London this spring, but the extended spell of cloudless blue skies and warmth hasn't stopped the English from complaining about their weather.</p>
        <p>''Beautiful day, isn't it?'' an American arriving for an academic conference said to a local resident in sunny Oxfordshire. ''Too beautiful,'' the Englishman replied.</p>
        <p>Behind the glum comment lay more than just cultural stubbornness.</p>
        <p>Temperatures are up, rivers are down and there is a sense of uneasiness over evidence that this famously wet place may be drying up.</p>
        <p>There is an intensifying drought in southern and eastern England, and if it continues, the tightly rolled umbrella as national symbol will have to make way for less elegant emblems like the wall-mounted water meter or the brick Britons put in lavatory cisterns to reduce the volume of water flushed down toilets.</p>
        <p>The last 24 months have been the driest two-year period in England and Wales since reliable record-keeping began 230 years ago. January was the fourth driest in all that time, March saw only a third of the usual rainfall, and the London Weather Center sees no likelihood of significant precipitation the rest of this month.</p>
        <p>This is the third consecutive year of alarmingly dry weather, and the Environment Agency warns that this may become a long-term phenomenon because of global warming.</p>
        <p>The early spring has produced floral bursts of forsythia shrubs, apple and cherry blossoms and flowering  daffodils, tulips, azaleas, violets and camelias. Green-  and white-striped canvas deck chairs have reappeared in Hyde Park, and in the surest rite of the London spring, pub-goers are taking their pints al fresco.</p>
        <p>But the soft April showers of which  Chaucer sang that ''perced to the roote'' the ''droghte of March'' have not showed up this year, and any delight at the leafy liberation from the clammy grip of the London winter has been undermined by fears of the creeping desertification of southern and eastern England.</p>
        <p>The Thames is so low that tourist boats can navigate the passage to Hampton Court only at high tide, and mud flats have appeared downstream in mid-river.</p>
        <p>In addition, Thames Water has been shown to have the worst leakage performance of any water company in the country, losing 4 of every  10 gallons of drinking water through the Victorian piping system under the city.</p>
        <p>The water crisis has become an issue in the national election scheduled for May 1. The Labor Party, which is far ahead in the polls, has said that one of its first acts in office will be to convene a ''water summit'' to study the performance of the newly privatized water companies suspected of siphoning off excessive amounts of water from rivers while diverting excessive profits to themselves.</p>
        <p>One water company in Kent, in the most afflicted eastern part of the country, is building a desalting plant, the country's first. Another is insisting that people obtain permits to water their lawns and is sending up spotter planes to catch violators. The rainfall in suburban Essex is now down to 24 inches a year, the level of some Middle East countries, and the area has been officially reclassified as semi-arid.</p>
        <p>Rain still falls in great quantities in the north -- the Lake District registers 130 inches a year -- but the population has been moving south and east, and tap-water use there has risen 30 percent in the last 20 years. Water is heavy to move and cannot be compressed, so the deluge that washes across northern England is of no use to residents in the south.</p>
        <p>Such is the reputation of England for being soggy that water would seem to be the last thing that people around here would want more of. But statistically less rain falls on London than on New York, Paris or Rome, and lots of activities and concerns dear to the English depend upon water.</p>
        <p>Gardeners worry that the drought could bring about a ban on the use of hoses and sprinklers. People are being urged to water plants late in the day to reduce loss through evaporation and even to shift to Mediterranean plants more accustomed to subsisting on little rain.</p>
        <p>Animal protection groups are upset that hedgehogs are going hungry because they cannot dig through the sunbaked soil to get at the earthworms they eat. Crayfish, lamprey and trout are disappearing from depleted small rivers and tributaries.</p>
        <p>This year's cereal harvest is threatened, and some vegetables are flowering early because of heat stress and will be lost or see their yields greatly reduced. English farmers have become more dependent on water supplies in recent decades as they have turned to irrigated crops that can be timed and grown to the kind of uniform perfection demanded by supermarket chains.</p>
        <p>Fires have run rampant across the dead gorse and heather of the heaths and grasslands in national parks, destroying insect, plant and bird life. Protected only by rural wardens whose sole recourse is to set up fire breaks, these areas lack the sophisticated aerial equipment found in places where forest fires have been traditional.</p>
        <p>Some people have been ignoring the doomsayers and celebrating the sunny and warm weather by going to English Channel resorts like Brighton and Bournemouth and running up their own records in purchases of  tanning lotions, dark glasses and ice cream for this time of year.</p>
        <p>But doctors, citing rising rates of skin cancer, have pointed out that the harmful rays they encounter on their Spanish holidays are now beaming down upon them from their own friendly English skies.</p>
