        <p>Spring cleaning should include the stereo system, if you want to continue to get top performance from it. Dirt, dust, cigarette smoke and air pollutants can degrade the performance of CD's and records, phonographs, tape decks and even cable connections. Luckily, the solutions are simple and for the most part inexpensive.</p>
        <p>Fingerprints are usually the biggest problem with CD's. Compact disk players ignore most dirt, but if too much accumulates, there will be clicks, fuzzy distortion or track-skipping. A CD's smooth surface is far easier to clean than an LP's grooved one. It can be done with a clean, damp cloth, taking care to to wipe across the disk, rather than around it in circles, and being especially gentle with the label side. A CD's sound is affected only by dirt on its unlabeled playing surface, but the label side is so thinly coated that scratches there can easily make the disc unplayable.</p>
        <p>For some reason, most people tend to rub in circles on round objects even though they know they should not in the case of CD's. That is why the stores are full of machines that move a cleaning pad across the disc with the correct radial motion. Available from such companies as Audio-Technica, Allsop, Discwasher and Recoton, most cost $12 to $30.</p>
        <p>Minor scratches on a CD's playing side usually do not affect the sound and can be ignored unless they grow bad enough to cause audible problems. If they do, try cleaning the disk first because dirt can worsen the effects of scratches. If that does not help, try polishing the scratch away. Polishes are sold for this purpose, but Rally cream auto wax does just as good a job for far less money.</p>
        <p>If your player skips on many disks, its lens might be dirty, especially if it performs in a heavy-smoking household. AudioSource, Discwasher, Recoton and others make lens cleaners that load like disks, for about $20 to $30.</p>
        <p>For records, unlike CD's, a good cleaner should be moved around the disk - never across it - and should have fibers that penetrate the grooves. Discwasher's classic Model D4+ brush and D4 fluid (about $15), and the fluids and cleaning brushes made by Last (about $20), do the job.</p>
        <p>Some experts say the absolute best way to clean records is with machines like those made by Nitty-Gritty and VPI, and Record Doctor, with motors that rotate records as they are gently scrubbed, dried and (in some cases) vacuumed clean. But these machines are fairly large and cost anywhere from $160 to $600, the top price being for a Nitty-Gritty model that cleans CD's as well as LP's.</p>
        <p>Static electricity can attract dust to your cleaned record surfaces. Conductive record brushes (like the Audioquest, about $15) can drain away some of the static charge, especially if the brush is grounded to a water pipe or radiator while you use it. Discwasher's Zerostat-3 gun (about $25) seems to do a more effective, but less even, job. In winter, especially in dry climates, it may pay to use both.</p>
        <p>Dirt on phonograph styluses, though hard to see, also reduces sound quality and shortens record life. The stylus can be cleaned with a thin-tipped camel's hair paintbrush, but better results are sometimes obtained with Discwasher's SC2 brush and fluid (under $10) and small, battery-powered stylus-cleaners like the AQ Electronic ($40). In practice, find both do about equally well, but the electronic models (which vibrate dirt free at ultrasonic frequencies) are safer for your stylus if you do not have absolutely steady hands.</p>
        <p>Like styluses, the tape heads inside a recorder require occasional cleaning. A cotton swab and a standard tape-head cleaning solution work well if your deck's heads are accessible. Cleaning chemicals containing fluorocarbons are now being phased out to avoid damage to the ozone layer. And alcohol, once a favorite cleaner, can attack the plastic in some tape heads, so do not use it unless your tape deck's manual says you can.</p>
        <p>For cassette decks with heads that are not accessible, there are cassette-shaped cleaning devices from many companies. Models that clean the motor-driven metal capstan and rubber pinch-roller that move the tape are preferable to those that just clean the heads.</p>
        <p>Special tape-head lubricants, usually applied with swabs, are available from Radio Shack and elsewhere, but they should be used only when playing old, dried-out tapes that stick and jerk as they go over the heads. Be very careful not to get these lubricants on the capstan and pinch roller, or you may find your tapes slipping by at uneven speeds as you play or record.</p>
        <p>If your tape is already slipping, try cleaning the capstan and pinch roller. If that doesn't work, apply Radio Shack's Non-Slip (No. 44-1013, 99 cents) to the roller.</p>
        <p>The system's cable connections should be checked and cleaned each year or two (more often for smokers or people who live near the sea). This usually involves just turning the system off, unplugging one connection, plugging it back on with a slight twist to rub off any accumulated grime or corrosion, then moving on to the next plug.</p>
        <p>The small amounts of time required for all this will be rewarded with clear sound for the new season.</p>
