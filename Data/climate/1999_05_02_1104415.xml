        <p>WITH summer fast approaching, homeowners with swimming pools are about to engage in an annual rite of spring -- opening up the pool in time for the Memorial Day weekend.</p>
        <p>While many will hire experts to do the job, others will tackle the task themselves.</p>
        <p>''Opening your pool is relatively easy -- as long as you know what you're doing,'' said Scott Wechsler, president of Pal Pools in Bohemia, N.Y.</p>
        <p>For many in-ground pool owners, Mr. Wechsler said, the biggest challenge is getting the cover off without allowing dirty water and debris to get into the relatively clean water underneath. The best way to do that, Mr. Wechsler said, is by pumping standing water off the cover to remove leaves or other debris. That sounds simple enough until one realizes that the accumulated debris is probably sitting smack in the middle of the cover. One way to make it easier to remove the debris is to increase the water level of the pool.</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Wechsler said, raising the water level in the pool also makes it easier to remove the cover itself.</p>
        <p>''You want to fill the pool to the middle of the skimmers,'' he said, referring to the inlets around the perimeter of the pool that allow water into the filter.</p>
        <p>With the water at that level, he said, the cover can usually be removed by two people -- with each grabbing a corner at the shallow end of the pool and dragging the cover five feet or so onto the pool apron.</p>
        <p>''People think that if they drag the other end of the cover into the water, it's going to fall in and sink,'' he said. ''But if you drag uniformly, the cover should float across the top of the water.''</p>
        <p>Dragging from the shallow end also makes it easier to ''fan fold'' the cover for storage.</p>
        <p>''You pick it up, walk five feet back, and fold,'' he said. ''You keep doing that, folding it on top of itself as you go, and it will come off in a breeze.''</p>
        <p>Tom Svatek, the owner of Sundance Swimming Pools in St. James, N. Y., said that if the cover -- and the homeowner removing it -- have done their jobs well, the water in the pool should be fairly clean. If not, Mr. Svatek said, any debris or sludge at the bottom of the pool should be removed using a commercial-grade net with an extension pole that will not bend or break.</p>
        <p>Homeowners should resist the temptation to ''start fresh'' by emptying a pool, he said, particularly if it is vinyl-lined. ''Vinyl pools are designed to be filled and remained filled,'' Mr. Svatek said. Should the pool be emptied, the liner can shift, tear or pull loose from the shell it covers.</p>
        <p>Once the pool has been opened and cleaned of solid debris, the next thing to do is to get the water moving through the filter.</p>
        <p>''We generally tell customers to let the filter run for about 24 hours,'' said Nick Spalletta, store manager for Dover Pools and Supplies in Toms River, N.J. ''That way you get the water on top mixing with the water on the bottom,'' he said. He added that such circulation was necessary to assure the success of the next step -- testing the water to get a picture of the overall chemistry of the pool.</p>
        <p>''One of the most common mistakes people make is putting chemicals in the pool before they have the water tested to find out what chemicals they need,'' Mr. Spalletta said. Most pool-supply companies will test customers' water samples free and provide a detailed analysis of the water, he added.</p>
        <p>Testing leads to the part of pool preparation and maintenance that is most perplexing to homeowners -- pool-water chemistry.</p>
        <p>Rob Cox, creator of www.poolcenter.com -- an Internet Web site that is a repository of information about pools and spas -- said that there were four parameters to test for: the pH level of the water in the pool, its alkalinity, its calcium hardness and its chlorine content. Water samples may be taken to a pool-supply company for testing or may be tested with an ''in-home'' kit, which should have its testing chemicals replaced every year.</p>
        <p>The pH level, Mr. Cox said, is a measure of how acidic or basic the water is, with levels below 7 considered acidic and those above 7 basic.</p>
        <p>''Ever hear of acid rain?'' Mr. Cox said. ''That is rainfall with a very low pH.''</p>
        <p>He explained that the pH level of the human eye is about 7.35, just slightly basic.</p>
        <p>''This is in range with proper pH levels for your pool,'' he said, explaining that the proper pH range -- 7.2 to 7.8 -- can be obtained by adding to the water chemicals known as pH increasers or pH decreasers, which are available at pool stores and home centers.</p>
        <p>The pH level is important, Mr. Cox said, because water that is too acidic -- a low pH -- can eat away at a pool's interior finish and corrode the copper tubing inside the pool heater.  Water with a high pH, he said, can create mineral-deposit buildups on the pool surface and in pipes in the filter and heater.</p>
        <p>The next thing to test for -- alkalinity -- affects the resistance of the water's pH level to change.</p>
        <p>''The right alkalinity keeps the pH from bouncing all over the place,'' Mr. Cox said. Low alkalinity, he explained, can be increased by adding a pH increaser, such as common baking soda, while high alkalinity can be reduced by adding acids, which are the chemicals in pH decreasers.</p>
        <p>The calcium hardness level, Mr. Cox said, is the measure of how hard or soft the water is.</p>
        <p>''We like to keep the calcium level in the range of 200 to 400 parts per million,'' Mr. Cox said, noting that calcium levels in general this year appear to be unusually low.</p>
        <p>''Most of the pools we're opening are taking 20 to 30 pounds of calcium,'' he said. The better test kits, he added, will indicate how much calcium is needed.</p>
        <p>After the pH, alkalinity and calcium levels of the pool are in proper balance, Mr. Cox said, it is time to ''shock'' the pool with chlorine to kill any algae or micro-organisms that may be present.</p>
        <p>''When you shock a pool, its like you're sending a lightning bolt through the water,'' he said. ''The lightning bolt slashes and burns its way through the cell walls of microcontaminants and destroys them.''</p>
        <p>Shocking the pool, however, Mr. Cox said, involves more than just adding a lot of chlorine.</p>
        <p>''There's a threshold known as 'breakpoint chlorination,' '' he said, explaining that the term refers to the point at which chlorine levels in the pool reach the critical mass necessary to produce the ''lightning effect.''</p>
        <p>''Generally speaking, it takes one pound of shock chlorine for every 10,000 gallons of water to reach breakpoint chlorination,'' Mr. Cox said, cautioning that it was always important to follow the manufacturer's instructions when using any pool chemical.</p>
        <p>After the pool has been properly shocked, he said, the chlorine content should be maintained at a level of 1 to 2 parts per million. The pool should be shocked at least once a month or whenever the chlorine content falls below the recommended level, he added.</p>
