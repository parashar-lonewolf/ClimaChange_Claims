        <p>LEAD: The state of many beaches this summer and scientific reports that pollution may be altering the climate are the two key factors contributing to a surge of support for the environmental movement.</p>
        <p>The state of many beaches this summer and scientific reports that pollution may be altering the climate are the two key factors contributing to a surge of support for the environmental movement.</p>
        <p>Clifton Curtis, president of the Oceanic Society, said he perceived ''a significant shift in attitude'' nationwide, adding that telephone calls and letters to his Washington-based research group were two to three times what they were at this time last year.</p>
        <p>''We're receiving calls from all over,'' he said, ''not just from people who live along the coast. They're worried about what's happening to the oceans, too.''</p>
        <p>Lester Brown, president of the Worldwatch Institute, said the experience at his research organization was much the same. ''We may be crossing a perceptual threshold,'' Mr. Brown said, adding that ''we're seeing an elevation of public awareness,'' with people ''finally starting to understand that we can kick nature only so long before nature starts kicking back.'' Contributions Are Rising</p>
        <p>Paula Hayes, director of development at the New York headquarters of the Environmental Defense Fund, said that contributions were up about 20 percent this summer.</p>
        <p>Officials at the Natural Resources Defense Council and officials of other organizations said they, too, had been receiving more mail, more phone calls, more inquiries, contributions and offers of help. They said that in many instances these expressions were from people who had never been involved with ecological issues.</p>
        <p>In Congress a spate of environmental bills has been introduced and recently formed bipartisan Congressionl groups like the Long Island Sound Caucus and the Hudson River Caucus have begun working on envirnonmental initiatives intended to aid their areas.</p>
        <p>In politics, homage to the need for environmental protection has become a standard part of each political party's message. President Reagan once mocked concern about acid rain by saying some of the acids were produced naturally by trees; both Presidential candidates, Vice President Bush and Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, are making the environment in general and the oceans in particular and an issue.</p>
        <p>In his speech accepting the Republican Presidential nomination Thursday night, Vice President Bush mentioned the problems of floating medical wastes, sludge dumping in the ocean and acid rain. ''I am going to stop ocean dumping,'' he said, adding that he would also ''have the F.B.I. trace the medical wastes'' and ''reduce the harm done by acid rain.''</p>
        <p>Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic Presidential nominee, has also emphasized the environmental issue. At one point he journeyed off the Jersey coast by boat to emphasize his worry about ocean pollution. 'Just Started to Get Scary'</p>
        <p>Several environmental advocates said they thought wider support of new environmental policies was inevitable, given this summer with its unusual heat, drought, beach closings, diseased shellfish and record levels of smog. Also, there were new reports of forest damage from acid rain and pollution damage to the ozone layer that protects the earth from dangerous radiation.</p>
        <p>''I think that for a lot of people it's just started to get scary,'' Mr. Brown said.</p>
        <p>A majority of Americans, 65 percent, agree that ''protecting the environment is so important that requirements and standards cannot be too high, and continuing environmental improvements must be made regardless of cost'' according to a New York Times/CBS News Poll conducted last month. Twenty-two percent disagreed with this statement in telephone interviews conducted July 5 through 8 with 1,177 adults.</p>
        <p>There is no meaningful statistical difference between these numbers and those from January 1986, the last time the question was asked, when 66 percent agreed and 22 percent disagreed. Before 1986, the percentage of respondents who agree had increased steadily since September 1981 when the question was first asked, and 45 percent agreed that protecting the environment is this important and 42 percent disagreed.</p>
        <p>Environmental groups say they hope to tap this wide support in seeking vastly increased government expenditures on research and development of advanced sewage treatment and recycling plants, industrial and agricultural toxic waste treatment and other projects long viewed as lacking in voter appeal.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists are also calling for stricter laws and enforcement against contamination of the water, air and land, increased energy conservation and a shift to cleaner energy sources and more limits on growth and development, particularly along the nation's beleaguered coasts. 'Throwaway Societies'</p>
        <p>To be sure, the medical wastes marring the New York metropolitan region's beaches this summer are not the first developments to bring about greater environmental awareness. A year ago, a Long Island garbage barge wandered the Atlantic in search of a harbor to dump in, vividly illustrating that ''throwaway societies are running out of places to throw things,'' said Mr. Brown.</p>
        <p>The dying dolphins that washed up along the East Coast about the same timewere yet another symbol of disruption of the natural ecology.</p>
        <p>It is still not certain that the predicted global warming linked to a buildup of certain industrial pollutants in the atmosphere is a significant factor in either the severe drought that has plagued large parts of the country or the heat wave felt from New York to Moscow to Shanghai.</p>
        <p>But this greenhouse effect and other developments are ''starting to make people understand that we're putting too much strain on the system,'' said Peter Bahouth, chairman of the board of Greenpeace U.S.A., an environmental advocacy group. Administration Shifts Stance</p>
        <p>Terrell Hunt, director of the Environmental Protection Agency's office of enforcement, said that within the Administration, too, a shift in the national mood had been detected and ''the agency is trying to become more creative and aggressive about using the powers available to us.''</p>
        <p>''We have been bringing in record numbers of charges, indictments and convictions,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Last week the Senate unanimously passed a bill outlawing disposal of sewage sludge at sea within four years. Objections were lodged by New York City, the nation's foremost sludge dumper, but the state's two Senators, whom the city had been counting on to derail the legislation, signed on as co-sponsors. They said they had undergone a change of heart on defending the integrity of the ocean. An Abrupt Change on Sludge</p>
        <p>One of the clearest milestones of how much attitudes have changed is that for half a century New York disposed of its sludge just 12 miles from shore with little public outcry. At the start of this year, the city agreed to switch to a site more than 100 miles off the coast, and yet, abruptly, dumping at that location became intolerable to the nation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reagan himself has changed his position, agreeing to freeze emissions of nitrogen oxide, an important air pollutant, as part of an international treaty to curb acid rain. As recently as 1985, the Administration had refused to take part in a similar accord.</p>
        <p>Federal legislation aimed at reducing acid rain has also recently been introduced in Congress. The legislation is based on a compromise between the states with many coal-fired power plants and factories emitting sulfur dioxide, which is transformed chemically in the atmosphere and falls to earth as acid rain, and the states that are suffering most where it falls. Both Parties Nod to Environment</p>
        <p>Some officials are beginning to consider whether stringent restrictions on burning fossil fuels may become needed to reduce the buildup of carbon dioxide, the gas that researchers say is the main contributor to the greenhouse effect.</p>
        <p>Just how high a priority the next President will actually give the war on environmental deterioration remains an open question: the environment will compete with the military and social welfare. The cost of a serious environmental rehabilitation effort could run to hundreds of billions of dollars, experts say.</p>
        <p>''Ten years from now one may look back on this time as a seminal moment when people began to look quite differently at these problems,'' said Jessica Tuchman Mathews, vice president of the World Resources Institute, a policy research center in Washington. ''But we shouldn't kid ourselves. It's going to be a long, bumpy road.''</p>
