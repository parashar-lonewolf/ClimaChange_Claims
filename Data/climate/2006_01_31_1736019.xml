        <p>A hopped-up ''Sesame Street'' aesthetic pervades the programming on mtvU Über, MTV's new broadband network, at www.mtvu.com. What's it about? A wholesome rainbow coalition of young adults seem to dance along the lanes of MTV's digital land, mugging, wielding consciences and admiring one another's video blogs. And that's the master plot, as far as it goes. If these kids are religious, they're cool about it. If they're political, they're blandly humanitarian. If they're in love, it's mostly online.</p>
        <p>For certain, they're vaguely depressed. On one interstitial sequence on Über, which shuffles a deck of video segments both live and on demand, a close-up on a bulletin board covered with happy fliers reveals simple graffiti: ''LONELY.''</p>
        <p>This is the 18-to-24 lifestyle, as MTV has most recently decreed it -- or more narrowly, it's the 18-to-22 lifestyle, since mtvU, the campus television channel, is programmed exclusively for college students, who (in the words of the press release) are ''the first adopters of new music, new technology and new trends.''</p>
        <p>Über pipes a version of that channel into your computer, and -- as futurists have been promising for more than a decade -- it's interactive programming, the fruit of the much-anticipated convergence between the Internet and old-time television, that relic that some now witheringly call ''linear television.''</p>
        <p>Über is interactive -- that is, to the extent that you can pause, fast-forward and rewind it, just as you can do with TiVo and all Web television; of course, you still can't teleport into cyberspace and jam with Death Cab for Cutie (a channel favorite), though breaking down the barrier between entertainers and the entertained seems to be Über's great promise. Already, the site has invited collegians to interview their favorite celebrities. The result is a series of fan interviews called ''15 Minutes With,'' in which nervous would-be broadcasters talk to stars like Charlize Theron, the actress; Mark Romanek, the music-video master; and Cynthia Rowley, the fashion designer.</p>
        <p>''15 Minutes With'' is pure neo-''Sesame Street.'' It has a kids-are-people-too earnestness to it, and you half expect the participants to wear Matt Drudge hats and end their segments by lisping to the camera, ''This is Jason Jones reporting from Kidsworld!'' But when the star being interviewed is someone deeply in sync with run-and-gun digital video and visual tone poems -- the supreme example being Mr. Romanek, who is the George Lucas of the video world -- the effect can be to suggest entirely new reference points for the arts. Repeatedly the segment referred to Mr. Romanek as a great ''visual artist'' of our time, and it's clear that Lucian Freud and Jasper Johns weren't even in the running.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere on Über, you can watch music videos. In fact, that's a lot of it. I hadn't binged on videos in front of Fuse or MTV2 in a long time, and choosing videos on Über and watching them on a PC (mtvU Über doesn't yet work on Macs) is surprisingly enjoyable. For example, Weezer's catchy hymn to impotence, ''Perfect Situation,'' has an outstanding video that imagines the band in a fictional earlier incarnation fronted by a girl (Elisha Cuthbert from ''24''). The silkily made video was more easily studied on a computer screen than a television screen; I felt free to sit close. Bright Eyes' video for ''At the Bottom of Everything,'' with a voice-over by Terence Stamp, chronicles a party among the passengers on a crashing 747: it's also superb.</p>
        <p>The other flotsam on Über -- oof, that Motley Crüe umlaut gets annoying -- is not so lovely, but somehow you do end up wanting to explore the outer limits of this well-designed site. The surprise is the same as it is on Al Gore's CurrentTV, which has the same Children's Television Workshop vibe: though the technology is new, the form is wide-open and the demo is young, Über doesn't quite yield radical discoveries. Its material is almost pushy with its tameness. Larry David films a brief warning against global warming; participants in the site's campaign can win a hybrid car, said to be Mr. David's. Other material shows Darfur to be the site's chosen cause. An ''Activism'' menu pulls down ''Stop the Genocide in Sudan,'' and brief public service announcements explain as if to 7-year-olds why this is a good idea.</p>
        <p>Other concerns of the site include sexual health and post-collegiate employment; mtvU and MonsterTrak, a student recruitment service, have created ''The Opening,'' an episodic series about -- of all things -- getting and keeping jobs. With ''The Opening,'' mtvU briefly abandons ''Sesame Street'' in favor of Richard Scarry.</p>
        <p>While you dart around the site, then, abandoning mediocre video for more promising video like half-eaten pizza in a dorm room, breaks for ''buffering'' occasionally slow you down. They're boring. While video loads, at least, you also get ample chances to study the well-crafted interstitial stuff -- like the ''LONELY'' thing -- and play the site's simple-minded word game. It works like ''Wheel of Fortune,'' with a clue and letters slowly filling themselves in while you guess. When I played, the same clues kept coming up. I guessed the first black man to win an Oscar: Sidney Poitier. But the eight-letter word for ''foolishly impractical'' eluded me. It turned out to be ''quixotic.''</p>
