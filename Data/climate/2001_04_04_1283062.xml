        <p>The Bush administration turned down a European request today that it reconsider a decision seen as likely to doom the international treaty on global warming known as the Kyoto accord.</p>
        <p>In meetings with European Union emissaries, who had been dispatched to Washington on an emergency mission, administration officials restated a view that the 1997 treaty was ''unfair to the United States'' and that it was not worthy of American support.</p>
        <p>The European Union has been a vocal supporter of the accord, and it was among the foreign voices that reacted harshly to President Bush's decision last week to abandon the treaty, which was signed by the United States and 100 other countries. After a meeting with Christie Whitman, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the head of the European delegation said he had heard no indication that the administration might change its mind.</p>
        <p>''We are going to continue the Kyoto process; we have the same objectives as before,'' said the delegation chief, Kjell Larsson, who is Sweden's environment minister. ''There are very small chances, if any, of United States participation.''</p>
        <p>The treaty has been ratified by only one country, Romania, and while it could technically be put into effect without American support, United States and foreign officials have described that scenario as highly unlikely.</p>
        <p>With another international meeting on global warming scheduled for later this month, in New York, the new American stance leaves unresolved even the most basic questions about how the Bush administration might now propose to tackle the problem.</p>
        <p>In a statement, Ms. Whitman said little more than that she was ''optimistic'' that through ''international processes we can develop technologies, market-based incentives, and other innovative approaches to global climate change.'' She delivered much the same message to a conference of environment ministers from the Western Hemisphere in Montreal last week.</p>
        <p>The White House has said the global warming policy is the subject of a cabinet-level review. But in a sign that the issue remains in flux, administration officials said today that no decisions had been made as to whether Ms. Whitman or some lower-level official would represent the United States at the New York meeting and at one in Bonn in July.</p>
        <p>''They do not have any concrete alternatives or options for the moment,'' Margot Wallstrom, the European Union's environment commissioner, said after today's meetings. With Japan, Russia, Germany, Britain, Canada, Australia and France all explicit in their criticism of the new American position, Ms. Wallstrom said, the issue was becoming a foreign-policy problem for the United States.</p>
        <p>''It is becoming clear to the Bush administration that this is about international relations as well, and other countries are reacting very strongly against the U.S.,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The Kyoto treaty, the most far-reaching international agreement on global warming, would require the United States and other industrialized countries to reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases by 5 percent to 7 percent below 1990 levels by 2012.</p>
        <p>The White House has objected in particular to the fact that, under the treaty, developing countries would not be subject to any immediate restriction. In ruling out a plan to impose restrictions on power plants' emissions of carbon dioxide, one of the gases that would be regulated under the accord, it said such a step would be too costly to the economy and to American consumers.</p>
        <p>The 16-member delegation also met today with Richard Armitage, the deputy secretary of state, and Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, who as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has been critical of the administration's decision to abandon hope for the Kyoto accord.</p>
        <p>Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, a research and advocacy group in Washington, said today that it was important that the administration move swiftly in formulating a new policy.</p>
        <p>''They know what they don't want, which is Kyoto,'' Ms. Claussen said. ''I don't think they're very far along in deciding what they do want.''</p>
