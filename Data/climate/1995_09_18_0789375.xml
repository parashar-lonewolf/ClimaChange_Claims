        <p>International A3-9 NEW CONCERNS OVER BOSNIA NATO gave the Bosnian Serbs a second 72-hour extension for removing weapons from around the capital, but a Government offensive raised fears that the steps taken toward peace could unravel. A1 IN RWANDA, SOME HAPPY ENDINGS The Rwandan massacres and civil war killed an estimated half million people and left 100,000 children separated from parents. Now a program is working to reunite some of the separated families. A1 A PERIOD OF CLIMATE CHANGE New assessments of the problem of climatic change indicate that it is likely to cause significant economic and social disruptions in the coming years if emissions of heat-trapping gases are not cut. A1 HONG KONG VOTERS' MESSAGE Hong Kong held its last legislative elections before China takes over the British colony in 1997, and voters appeared to deliver a blow to Beijing-backed candidates. A8 CZECH ENVIRONMENTAL EFFORT A model program to reduce gases that are altering the world's climate is being set up in the Czech Republic by American companies, and it could be widely copied in Eastern Europe if it works. A8 ISRAEL TALKS STILL IN DEADLOCK Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, under pressure to complete an agreement, continued talks on self-rule, but a sticking point still remained. A3 CUBA HOLDS RENEGADE U.S. OFFICER Cuba has arrested a former C.I.A. officer wanted in the United States for 15 years for an array of charges, but it was not clear whether he would be turned over. A6 A proposal was reported to aid Northern Ireland talks. A6 Haiti voted in elections seen likely to stabilize its Government. A5 Johannesburg Journal: A papal mass, and a new day. A4 National A10-12, B7-8 MOVE AGAINST LOBBYING House Republican leaders have decided to bring anti-lobbying measures to the floor in the next few weeks, abandoning their plan to wait until next year. A1 IMPLANT CASE'S FAR REACH Never has the rush to doctors' offices in a class-action suit been so startling -- or the financial stakes so high for patients, doctors, lawyers and manufacturers -- as in the case of breast implants. A1 PERIL IN TUBERCULOSIS The surge in tuberculosis is due less to the limits of medicine than to the profit motives of drug companies, participants at an international meeting said. A1 TURNER DEAL SEEMS SET Ending a tortuous, monthlong courtship, Time Warner's $8 billion offer for Turner Broadcasting seems likely to be approved by both companies' boards this week after Time Warner apparently struck a deal with a big Turner stockholder.A1 VIRGIN ISLANDS SURVEY DAMAGE Hurricane Marilyn moved on from St. Thomas, but it left the Caribbean island vastly damaged. A10 VOTING ON SEATTLE'S FUTURE Seattle voters will go to the polls to decide whether to pay for a large park and a new stadium. A10 QUEST FOR SPORT TEAMS FAULTED Municipal officials from across the Southeast were told at a gathering in Atlanta that the competition among cities to attract sports teams was misguided. A10 PREDICTING WELFARE OVERHAUL Newt Gingrich predicted that Congress would complete an overhaul of welfare by Thanksgiving and come up with a measure reducing the rules on how states conduct their welfare programs.
