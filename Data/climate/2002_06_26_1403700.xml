        <p>President Bush arrived here tonight for the annual summit meeting of major industrialized nations, but instead of basking in compliments for his actions to combat terrorism, he faced skepticism over his demand that Yasir Arafat be replaced.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush got a first taste of the diplomatic dance he is likely to see more of here when he met this evening with the meeting's host, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien of Canada. Mr. Chrétien embraced the idea of a ''quick election'' in the Palestinian territories, but then said: ''The president talked about perhaps it will be better to replace Mr. Arafat. I don't have the specific point of view on that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush himself said little about his speech today. Asked about Israel's continued incursions into the West Bank, he said, ''Everybody has got a right to defend themselves,'' but, sensitive not to tip the balance too far in one direction, quickly added, ''There also had to be a vision toward a way forward.''</p>
        <p>Administration officials professed to be unfazed by the criticism, and aboard Air Force One today Mr. Bush's press secretary, Ari Fleischer, said the reaction to the speech ''has been good.'' White House officials appeared to be hearing the parts of the reaction they wanted to hear, just as Arab and European allies seemed to choose only parts of the speech for praise.</p>
        <p>But as leaders of the Group of 8 from around the world arrived here tonight and flew by helicopter to Kananaskis, a remote mountain resort 60 miles into the Canadian Rockies where they are sealed off from protesters and the press, there was little doubt that Mr. Bush's attempt to force Mr. Arafat from power would dominate the unscripted moments of the meeting.</p>
        <p>France, Germany and the European Union all criticized some aspects of Mr. Bush's approach before their leaders arrived here, even while praising the president for setting a loose timeline of three years for the creation of a Palestinian state and for calling for Israel's eventual withdrawal to its pre-1967 borders.</p>
        <p>But it was clear that Mr. Bush, who obviously hoped for an endorsement of his Mideast approach by the leaders here, will have to argue his case. ''I would not be surprised if the leaders discussed with the president their thoughts about the speech,'' Mr. Fleischer said.</p>
        <p>Among the skeptics it is clear he will have to convince is Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, who is due here late on Wednesday. Mr. Annan warned today that the American insistence on free elections among the Palestinian people could easily backfire. ''You could find yourself in a situation that the radicals are the ones that get elected, and it would be the result of a democratic process and we have to accept that,'' Mr. Annan said.</p>
        <p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who will join the political discussions here but not the economic strategy sessions, said before he left Moscow that it would be ''dangerous and mistaken'' to remove Mr. Arafat because doing so ''would only radicalize the Palestinian movement.''</p>
        <p>What makes the dynamic at this meeting potentially the most interesting, though, is that Mr. Bush and the rest of the leaders will be arguing not only over Mideast policy, but also over a broad agenda of other differences that were submerged for months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</p>
        <p>At the summit meeting last year in Genoa, Mr. Bush and his allies promised to pick up the pieces on their differences over the Kyoto protocol on global warming, but in the year since there has been little progress.</p>
        <p>Trade tensions have worsened: European leaders made it clear they believe Mr. Bush has turned his back on his commitment to free markets by blocking steel imports and raising subsidies to farmers.</p>
        <p>''I very much rely on the Canadians to be more outspoken here when it comes to criticizing'' the United States, the German chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, told reporters as he visited Mr Chrétien. ''Because I -- speaking not only for Germany, but also for Europe -- have to say that we who sit in glass houses should ideally not be throwing stones.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps in an effort to defuse the criticism before it starts, Mr. Bush's trade officials have been rapidly issuing exemptions from the steel tariffs. That allows the president to argue at home that he acted to protect the American steel industry, and tell his allies that their most important products will not be affected.</p>
        <p>But today Robert S. Miller Jr., the chairman of Bethlehem Steel, charged that ''granting a large number of exemptions will negate the original purpose of the president's imposition of tariffs -- the recovery of the American steel industry.''</p>
        <p>The Europeans are also complaining that the farm bill that Mr. Bush signed last month will greatly increase American subsidies to farmers. The Europeans, Canada and Japan do the same, of course -- today Canada was found in violation of World Trade Organization rules governing dairy supports. But Mr. Bush has seriously undercut his argument that these subsidies should be gradually eliminated.</p>
        <p>Of course, these differences will be politely couched in public: since the summit meetings began in 1975, there has been an unwritten rule that the leaders emphasize their common goals, which in this case will include increasing aid to Africa and working out a common method of increasing airplane security.</p>
        <p>The summit meetings were also created to keep the global economy from veering off course, and there is concern that the major economies may be headed for more trouble.</p>
        <p>The sharp fall in the American stock market, along with renewed financial crises in Latin America and yet another year with little sign of economic recovery in Japan, are rekindling concern that whatever economic progress seemed under way early this year has ended.</p>
