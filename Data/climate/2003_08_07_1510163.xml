        <p>An antiregulatory group sued the Bush administration yesterday to force it to stop distributing a report on climate change that the group contends is inaccurate and biased.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit was filed in Federal District Court in Washington by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a group with industry support that contends global warming poses no significant risks.</p>
        <p>The suit argues that the continued use of the report, which was published in 2000, violates the Federal Data Quality Act, which requires information the government disseminates to pass standards for objectivity, quality and utility, assuring that it is reliable enough for public use.</p>
        <p>Officials at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, which was named as a defendant with President Bush, declined to comment, saying the White House had not yet seen the suit.</p>
        <p>The report under challenge is the National Assessment of the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change, an analysis of the probable effects of rising temperatures Congress commissioned in 1990. The aim was to show possible impacts of global warming from building levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases. The report is available online at earth.usgcrp.gov/usgcrp/nacc.</p>
        <p>The suit says the report's results were generated by flawed computer models and portrayed some historical climate data without including the potential range of error in temperature readings for past centuries.</p>
        <p>The report was the product of nearly a decade of work, mostly in the Clinton administration, by dozens of government and private scientists. Several authors of the study said that slim budgets and tight deadlines forced them to compromise sometimes on their choice of computer models and other tools.</p>
        <p>Because of the inherent weaknesses, the study quickly became a target of industry lobbyists, conservatives, and a small group of scientists who contend that greenhouse emissions do not pose a significant threat.</p>
        <p>Christopher C. Horner, a senior fellow at the institute, said the suit would put alarmism on trial. ''They don't have to try to unring a bell,'' he said, noting that the report had been broadly distributed. ''They just have to cease in disseminating it until they correct it.''</p>
