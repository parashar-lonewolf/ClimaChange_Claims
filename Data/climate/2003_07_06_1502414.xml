        <p>PUBLIC opinion is tough enough on chief executives these days, but try being the boss of a utility when some of its own shareholders have labeled it one of the ''Filthy Five'' for its copious carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
        <p>That's where James E. Rogers, the president and chief executive of the Cinergy Corporation, finds himself. Cinergy, based in Cincinnati, provides electrical power to about two million customers in Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky. Ninety percent of the electricity it produces comes from its coal-powered plants, which release as much as 70 million tons of carbon dioxide annually. Because of concern about greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, environmental groups have pressed Cinergy and other utilities to reduce emissions and report on their efforts. Earlier this year, a coalition of shareholders, including the State of Connecticut pension fund and the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, filed a proxy resolution asking Cinergy to report its climate change risks.</p>
        <p>(Cinergy successfully petitioned the S.E.C. to prevent a vote. But similar ideas have drawn significant support in proxy votes at other electrical utilities -- 27 percent at American Electric Power and 23 percent at the Southern Company.)</p>
        <p>While under pressure to reduce emissions, Cinergy must consider customers' desire for reasonably priced power and investors' desire for profit. ''My job is to balance the sometimes competing needs of these different stakeholders,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A former consumer advocate who fought rate increases and a former regulator for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Mr. Rogers, 55, seems to understand the opposition to Cinergy's legislative and environmental positions.</p>
        <p>In 1990, not long after he took the helm of the company, he broke from the industry and supported amendments to the federal Clean Air Act that sought to reduce sulfur dioxide. In testimony before the Senate in 2001, he advocated setting limits for carbon dioxide emissions as part of comprehensive national emissions-reduction legislation -- a position he has since backed away from.</p>
        <p>''Having been on many sides of the issue gives me a unique perspective,'' he said. ''My whole career has been predicated on making common cause with other groups.''</p>
        <p>That has earned him respect even from people who are generally critical of utilities. ''He's one of the new breed of utility executives,'' said David G. Hawkins, director of the climate center at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group based in New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rogers, who grew up in Kentucky and earned a law degree from the University of Kentucky, married his first wife, Robyn, when he was 19; they had three children -- Chrissy, who is now 35; Kara, 34; and Benjamin, 31. The marriage ended in divorce in 1975. He married his present wife, Mary Ann, in 1977.</p>
        <p>After graduation, he was an assistant attorney general for the State of Kentucky, where he fought utility rate increases. In two stints at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, he helped to enforce environmental regulations and served as deputy general counsel for enforcement and litigation. In between, he worked at the Washington office of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &amp; Feld, a law firm that represented many energy companies.</p>
        <p>He then worked for Houston Natural Gas, in charge of its interstate pipelines, a $2.6 billion business. He jumped at the chance to take the helm of a troubled gas pipeline company called Public Service Indiana, leaving Houston Natural Gas before it changed its name to Enron.</p>
        <p>An early task at Public Service Indiana was to meet with groups that opposed, and ultimately defeated, its plan for a nuclear reactor. After sinking $26 million into construction, the company abandoned it just before he took over, and he worked to mend relations with opponents. ''Rogers came in as the white knight,'' said Michael A. Mullett, a co-founder of and now lawyer for Citizens Action Coalition, which opposed the plant. ''He reached out to people.''</p>
        <p>In 1994, Mr. Rogers engineered a merger with Cincinnati Gas and Electric, fighting off a hostile takeover bid, and created Cinergy, which has a market value of $6.4 billion.</p>
        <p>MR. ROGERS, who calls himself a ''public policy junkie,'' has testified 11 times before Congress on energy issues. He says his role as head of a major energy company gives him ''a special responsibility to understand and deal with this issue responsibly.''</p>
        <p>But that requires yet another balancing act. Testifying in April on behalf of the Edison Electric Institute, an energy industry group, he backed President Bush's Clear Skies proposal, which would limit some emissions, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury, but not carbon dioxide, which is the biggest pollutant created by burning coal. The proposal, which favors utilities like Cinergy that depend on coal for most of their fuel, does not go as far as what Mr. Rogers had advocated before Congress just two years ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rogers said the earlier testimony had reflected his personal views, not the industry's. ''Our industry is not ready to go as far as I am at this point,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He says he believes science clearly shows that the planet is warming, and that energy companies like his should reduce or at least hold steady their emissions. Cinergy has spent around $1 billion to convert a coal-fired plant to natural gas, which emits two-thirds less carbon dioxide, and to buy two gas-fired plants. It has also experimented with renewable energy sources like windmills and fuel cells. Its carbon dioxide emissions have hovered near the same level for the three years through 2002.</p>
        <p>He said that while the government, industry and environmentalists battle over how to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the government should regulate other emissions like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury. ''There's a saying in Washington: 'The perfect is sometimes the enemy of the good,' '' he says.</p>
        <p>He says he is being pragmatic, but others say his actions reflect his skill at political maneuvering. ''He's constantly recalculating,'' said Mr. Mullett of Citizens Action Coalition. ''Wherever he considers the political balance is, that's where he wants to be.''</p>
        <p>After an initial honeymoon period, he said, Mr. Rogers disappointed the consumer group by pursuing California-style energy deregulation in markets where Cinergy operates and letting an energy conservation campaign lapse. Cinergy is petitioning for a rate increase of 15 percent in Indiana to cover environmental expenditures and increase capacity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mullet and others have said Mr. Rogers has felt it expedient to back away from earlier support of regulations to limit production of carbon dioxide because the Bush administration has refused to recognize any link between human activities and global climate change.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hawkins of the Natural Resources Defense Council said: ''Jim still has the same vision of where the industry needs to go. But he's a little more circumspect given the environment his company is working in today.''</p>
        <p>PRIVATE SECTOR  Correction:  July 13, 2003, Sunday  An article last Sunday about James E. Rogers, president and chief executive of Cinergy, misstated the amount invested by the company, then known as Public Service Indiana, in a nuclear reactor before the company abandoned it. The sum was $2.6 billion, not $26 million.</p>
        <p>The article also misstated the business of Public Service Indiana. It was an electrical utility, not a gas pipeline company.</p>
