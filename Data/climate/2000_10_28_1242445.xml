        <p>AL GORE  Remarks yesterday at a rally in Charleston, W.Va.:</p>
        <p>''You better believe that we need to produce energy independence as much as we possibly can at a time when we are so dependent on fragile sources of foreign oil from the Middle East, and that means, among other things, investing in clean coal technology to help protect the environment, protect against global warming and use our resources cleanly.</p>
        <p>You want somebody who will fight on behalf of the widows of miners. You want somebody who understands coming from part of Appalachia. My home in Tennessee is on the edge of Appalachia, and my Congressional district that I started representing 24 years ago includes a big part of the district that is in Appalachia, with coal miners.</p>
        <p>I have spent many a Saturday night in a small courthouse filling out forms related to black lung. I have spent many an hour talking to the survivors and talking to coal miners who are suffering from black lung because there were not adequate safety measures, because the ticket on the other side did vote 18 times against black lung and because the ones that agree with them have fought it every step of the way.</p>
        <p>And I've heard the stories and I've seen the faces. I've looked into the eyes of those who've been broken down by it, abused by it, who've had their health taken from them by it, and I'm telling you, I will never rest until we have justice for those who have been denied justice and benefits for those who are eligible for those benefits.''</p>
