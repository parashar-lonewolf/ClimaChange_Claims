        <p>Playing It by Ear</p>
        <p>Synchronized swimmers perform their in-water acrobatics with the help of well-developed arms, legs and lungs (not to mention a pair of nose plugs and a gelatin hairdo to keep the tresses neat while flailing around).</p>
        <p>For whales and other cetaceans, apparently, an important aid has been well-developed ears. According to research by scientists from University College London, the Indian Institute of Technology and other institutions, the evolution of the semicircular canal in the inner ear helped whales rapidly adapt to life in the water.</p>
        <p>Scientists have long studied existing and fossilized skeletons of cetaceans to determine how these mammals made the jump from land to sea. Those skeletons show what appears to be a gradual transition, with the relatively slow development of flippers and flukes.</p>
        <p>But the new research, reported in the journal Nature, shows that the shift was probably much more rapid. The researchers studied the size of the semicircular canals in cetaceans, both contemporary and fossilized, and found that they became much smaller in proportion to overall body size than those of other mammals.</p>
        <p>Ear canals help the body maintain equilibrium and balance, and a smaller canal would be less sensitive to spins and gyrations. (If you took Flipper with you on the Tilt-a-Whirl at your local amusement park, for instance, he'd end up helping you off.)</p>
        <p>The smaller canals are visible in the earliest marine cetacean fossils, indicating that they evolved quickly to enable the animals to tolerate the constant agile swimming movements required of an underwater existence. What's more, the researchers suggest, the development of smaller canals may have represented a point of no return in cetacean evolution, as they would not have provided enough of a sense of balance to allow much if any movement on land.</p>
        <p>A Meteoric Rewrite</p>
        <p>The classic meteor crater, like the one near Winslow, Ariz., is circular. But if a large meteor came in at a low enough angle, it would be expected to form a cluster of elongated craters as it hit and split into fragments big enough to create craters on their own. Such low-angle entries are rare, and only one cluster of ''ricochet'' craters has been found, in the Argentine Pampas.</p>
        <p>Check that -- no ricochet craters have been found. New research by a team of scientists from Britain, the United States and other countries has shown that what had been declared in 1991 to be a ricochet cluster -- a group of 11 elongated craters formed 4,000 years ago -- is actually a product of the wind acting on the region's fine silty soils.</p>
        <p>The researchers used satellite images to study the area, and discovered another 400 or so elongated craters -- all, like the first 11, in line with the pattern of prevailing winds. And while the original claim of a meteor impact had been bolstered by the finding of several meteorites and many tektites (glassy rocks formed by the intense heat of an impact), the new research uncovered other, older meteorites. The researchers suggest there is nothing particularly special about these rocks, that they just accumulated in the silt over time.</p>
        <p>What's more, the researchers write in the journal Science, the tektites are even older, dating to about 500,000 years ago, and are similar to tektites found hundreds of miles away. So while the ricochet event did not occur, there was an impact in the region, a far more ancient and massive one that scattered tektites over thousands of square miles.</p>
        <p>An Icy Breakup</p>
        <p>It's been a bad couple of months for Antarctic ice shelves. Another large chunk has broken off, this time from the Ross shelf. The 45-by-4-mile section was noticed in satellite pictures taken on May 5.</p>
        <p>Early indications are that the breakup was a normal ''calving'' event, unrelated to any climate change, unlike an even bigger breakup of a huge section of the Larsen ice shelf in March.</p>
