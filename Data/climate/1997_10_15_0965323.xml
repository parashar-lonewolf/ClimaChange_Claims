        <p>President Clinton had a simple message for Brazil today, and he delivered it over and over, in several different ways: The United States takes this country seriously. Really. It doesn't want to dictate relations in the hemisphere, but just to do more business.</p>
        <p>Appearing at a joint news conference here with the Brazilian President, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Mr. Clinton tried repeatedly to dispel longstanding Brazilian suspicions of American attitudes. In answer to a Brazilian journalist's question, he said that he did not feel threatened by the emergence of Brazil as a hemispheric powerhouse.</p>
        <p>''I actually support the emergence of countries to a greater role of influence and responsibilities, as long as they share our basic values,'' he said, citing commitments to democracy, open trade and environmental protection.</p>
        <p>This is the first visit of his Presidency to Brazil, and Mr. Clinton appeared anxiious to play catch-up. He and his aides have repeatedly noted that the European Union is rushing in to capitalize on Brazil's economy.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Clinton did not only play the supplicant. He gently nudged Brazil toward joining an effort to reduce greenhouse gases. As nations prepare for an international conference on global warming in December, a central dispute is whether developing countries should share the burden of cutting emissions when developed ones have enjoyed most of the benefits of profligately polluting.</p>
        <p>Still, while he said that ''we must all participate'' in reducing such gases, Mr. Clinton emphasized that he did not expect Brazil's efforts to interfere with its economic growth. ''The United States would never knowingly make any suggestion that would undermine the growth of Brazil or any other country,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Cardoso repeatedly praised his relations with Mr. Clinton and Brazil's with the United States, updating the American saw about General Motors: ''We feel what's good for Brazil is good for the United States, and what's good for the United States is good for Brazil as well.''</p>
        <p>But he made clear that Brazil would continue expanding trade with all comers, whether or not Mr. Clinton ultimately wins so-called fast-track authority from Congress to conduct trade negotiations. ''If there is going to be this sort of a policy or not is the United States' problem,'' Mr. Cardoso said.</p>
        <p>Not all Brazilians were as welcoming as Mr. Cardoso, however. A handful of protesters here pelted the President's limousine with manure.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, bowing to a point of Brazilian pride, made the clearest statement to date that the United States recognizes the importance of Mercosur, a regional trade bloc in which Brazil is the biggest member. ''I support Mercosur,'' Mr. Clinton said, adding that any new free-trade zone would be ''consistent with Mercosur and the leadership and role of Brazil.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said he expected Brazil to sell more to Europe. ''I don't feel threatened by it, I just want to make sure we're fully competing,'' he said. ''And if we don't fully compete, it will be our fault, not yours and Europe's.'' But he took a dig at the Europeans, noting that the United States had lower tariffs than the European Union.</p>
        <p>The two leaders said today that, three years after Mr. Clinton won agreement from Latin American leaders for a hemispheric free trade zone by 2005, the two countries would finally begin negotiations toward that goal next year.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Cardoso and other Brazilian officials indicated that they wished to move slowly in lowering some barriers to foreign competitors. ''We are not prepared to go for a new round of tariff reduction commitments by 2000,'' said Pedro Malana, the Finance Minister.</p>
