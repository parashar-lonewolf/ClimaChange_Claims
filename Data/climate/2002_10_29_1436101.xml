        <p>European Union officials and environmentalists criticized two developments at talks in New Delhi aimed at curbing global warming. One was a retreat by Russia from its announced plans to speedily ratify the Kyoto protocol, the first to require cuts in heat-trapping gases. Russia's delegate said the details needed more study. The other issue was a draft declaration from negotiators halfway through the 10-day conference that appeared to reflect the views of the Bush administration, which rejected the pact last year. Without American participation, ratification by Russia is essential for the treaty to have legal force.</p>
