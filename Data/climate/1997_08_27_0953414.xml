        <p>Ed McMahon was never a talk-show host. But now he plays one on TV.</p>
        <p>For 30 years on the ''Tonight'' show, Mr. McMahon was the sidekick and straight man to that master of the talk-show genre, Johnny Carson.

        <p>Ed McMahon was never a talk-show host. But now he plays one on TV.</p>
        <p>For 30 years on the ''Tonight'' show, Mr. McMahon was the sidekick and straight man to that master of the talk-show genre, Johnny Carson. His face was familiar, too, as the host of ''Star Search,'' a television variety show; as co-host with Jerry Lewis of the annual Labor Day Muscular Dystrophy Telethon, and as a pitchman for a magazine subscription service's sweepstakes.</p>
        <p>Now, at the age of 74, he is tackling his first regular role in a television series. ''The Tom Show,'' which will make its debut on the WB network on Sept. 7 at 9 P.M., stars Tom Arnold as a television producer who fails in Hollywood and returns to his hometown, St. Paul., to work as the producer of a morning television talk show, ''Breakfast With Charlie.'' Mr. McMahon plays Charlie Dickerson, the show's long-time host and the Arnold character's old friend.</p>
        <p>Mr. McMahon has been offered a few sitcom roles in the past but none that appealed to him. ''One was a used-car salesman, and that wasn't me,'' he said in a telephone interview yesterday. ''This one is perfect. I'm like Arthur Godfrey. I'm a revered breakfast-show guy, who's been on the air for 43 years.</p>
        <p>''Then Tom's character comes in and decides to change things, and brings in this hippie-dippie girl to be my co-host. She wants to talk about global warming, and I want to talk about the right temperature for waffles.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McMahon said it was something of a challenge to memorize lines. ''No cue cards or Teleprompter, which I'm used to using. It's like performing a little playlet every week. And I've been working at it so hard, by the time we shoot, I know everyone else's lines, too.''</p>
        <p>In the early 1950's, in Philadelphia, Mr. McMahon said, he was host of a breakfast show.</p>
        <p>''So that's not a stretch,'' he said. ''But the character is. He's a fuddy-duddy type, and I'm not a fuddy-duddy. At least, I feel I'm up to the minute.''</p>
