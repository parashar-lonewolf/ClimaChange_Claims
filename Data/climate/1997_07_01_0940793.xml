        <p>EVEN as Russian engineers devise ways to repair the battered Mir space station, some experts are wondering if it should continue to be used.</p>
        <p>Mir, which has been operating in space for more than twice its original five-year design life, has been showing its age through a series of breakdowns and problems that have been accelerating in recent months. In the latest mishap, an unmanned Progress cargo vessel rammed Mir during a practice redocking on Wednesday, rupturing one of the station's pressurized research modules and knocking out almost half of the station's electrical power.</p>
        <p>Frank Culbertson, director of the space shuttle-Mir cooperative program at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said on Friday that the space agency was still going ahead with preparations and training for a September flight to Mir. The shuttle Atlantis is to leave Wendy Lawrence, the sixth of seven American astronauts scheduled to work on Mir, for a four-month stay and to retrieve the astronaut Michael Foale, who has been aboard since May.</p>
        <p>But before Ms. Lawrence is allowed to stay, Mr. Culbertson said, the American space agency will have to determine if it is safe and if useful research is possible because the station has lost so much equipment and power. Half the American scientific equipment aboard Mir is in the abandoned Spektr laboratory module, which was disabled in the accident.</p>
        <p>Even before the collision last week, some critics and members of Congress had argued that Mir was too old and prone to problems to continue operating safely. In February, a defective oxygen generator started a fierce, 14-minute fire that spewed flames and chunks of molten metal into part of the station, almost causing an evacuation before astronauts extinguished it. In subsequent weeks, the cooling system leaked, causing the crew to breathe irritating fumes; oxygen generators failed, and the carbon dioxide removal system broke down.</p>
        <p>''One breakdown rarely gets you,'' says James E. Oberg, a Houston-based engineer who is an expert on the Russian space program. ''It's a series of breakdowns that get you. The danger of any older system is that failures cascade.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Oberg said the United States had learned very important lessons as a result of stationing people on Mir during the last year and a half, including how to cooperate with the Russians in joint operations and how to do long-term experiments in space that will be helpful in managing the international space station. However, he says, Mir is now too dangerous for anyone to stay there.</p>
        <p>''NASA has deliberately left people on a space station that is overaged and under-supported,'' he said. ''It would be reckless to send anyone else.''</p>
        <p>Marcia Smith, a space policy specialist with the Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress, said the space agency might not have much more to gain from stationing more of its astronauts aboard Mir. ''We've certainly learned a lot about space station operations from our work on Mir, including how to deal with major problems,'' Ms. Smith said on Friday. ''But it might be difficult for NASA to explain the need for more astronauts aboard Mir if they have lost half of their experiments.''</p>
        <p>It would still be possible to maintain a partnership with the Russians should they keep Mir operating by having United States space shuttles periodically visit the station for joint research and operations without leaving Americans there for long-duration stays, she said.</p>
        <p>Dr. John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said it was too early to make a decision on continuing an American presence on Mir. It may be possible to repair the station enough to satisfy safety and research concerns and to maintain a good working relationship with the Russians, he said.</p>
        <p>''If the Russians stay and we pull out because of safety concerns, we are saying our judgment is better than theirs and we don't trust their decisions,'' he said, ''and that's something you don't want to do with someone who is supposed to be a partner in the future international space station.''</p>
        <p>The United States might justify curtailing extended stays on Mir, he said, if use of the Spektr module and its experiments cannot be recovered and it is not feasible to replace the research to make long visits scientifically worthwhile.</p>
        <p>''The Russians have had humans in space almost continuously since 1971 and know how to do this better than anyone,'' Dr. Logsdon said. ''We shouldn't be in a hurry to abandon working with them for political reasons.''</p>
        <p>But critics like Mr. Oberg say the dangers of working on Mir are too great to risk losing astronauts in an avoidable accident, which could deliver a severe blow to future human space projects. ''This accident is an opportunity to get out,'' he said. ''As people used to say during the Vietnam era, this is a 'million-dollar wound,' one that's bad enough to get you sent home without killing you.''</p>
