        <p>In the largest settlement ever reached under the nation's Clean Air Act, the Dominion Virginia Power Company has agreed to spend $1.2 billion installing pollution-reducing technology in eight coal-burning power plants in Virginia and West Virginia.</p>
        <p>New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have long complained that emissions from Dominion plants in those two states were polluting their air.

        <p>In the largest settlement ever reached under the nation's Clean Air Act, the Dominion Virginia Power Company has agreed to spend $1.2 billion installing pollution-reducing technology in eight coal-burning power plants in Virginia and West Virginia.</p>
        <p>New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have long complained that emissions from Dominion plants in those two states were polluting their air. Under the agreement that all five states reached with the Environmental Protection Agency, Dominion will install more modern controls by 2013. They are expected to achieve a two-thirds reduction in emissions of sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain, and nitrogen oxide, which causes smog.</p>
        <p>The company has also agreed to pay $5.3 million in federal penalties and $14 million for various states' environmental projects like energy and land conservation.</p>
        <p>''These settlement efforts show this administration's firm commitment to fully enforcing our environmental laws,'' Christie Whitman, the E.P.A. administrator, said.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, the environmental agency announced substantial settlements with two other corporations, Alcoa and Archer Daniels Midland, under the same provision of the Clean Air Act.</p>
        <p>The Dominion settlement is the end of a four-year effort led by the New York attorney general's office, which sued Dominion in 1999 for violating terms of the Clean Air Act that govern pollution controls on old coal-fired power plants.</p>
        <p>Despite using more nuclear energy, the Northeastern states have been among the most aggressive in taking action against coal-fired power plants because they are downwind from many plants in the Midwest and the South.</p>
        <p>The current settlement is substantively identical to one tentatively reached in 2000 under the Clinton administration. The final agreement was delayed when the Bush administration tried to revamp the rules.</p>
        <p>''There were a lot of parties involved, and it was a very complex issue,'' said Dan Genest, a spokesman for Dominion. ''We met, discussed. It was hard just to get everyone involved together.''</p>
        <p>But the states pressed on.</p>
        <p>''It proves that you need vigorous state enforcement at a time when the feds are not vigorously enforcing the law,'' said Eliot L. Spitzer, the New York attorney general.</p>
        <p>J. P. Suarez, head of the enforcement division of the environmental agency, said that even with the delay, the schedule of upgrades would be the same as in the 2000 agreement.</p>
        <p>''The target dates haven't changed,'' Mr. Suarez said. ''The actual finalizing has taken longer than we would have liked, but we are happy.''</p>
        <p>Older power plants that modernize are required to install new pollution controls under the ''new source review'' provision of the Clean Air Act, but work that is considered routine maintenance does not trigger the increased pollution controls. State attorneys general have asserted that many power plants are doing substantive upgrades under the guise of routine maintenance.</p>
        <p>In 2000, the environmental agency sent Dominion a notice of violation that alleged that a power plant in West Virginia, Mount Storm, had made modifications to its generating units without obtaining the proper permits in violation of the Clean Air Act. In response, Dominion said it had conducted only routine maintenance.</p>
        <p>The settlement is to be filed on Monday in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, whose approval is required after a mandatory 45-day period for public comment.</p>
