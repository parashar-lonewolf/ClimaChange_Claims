        <p>LEAD: ''WE are heirs to a tradition,'' said Bruno Duteurtre, who heads Moet &amp; Chandon's enological research laboratory in Epernay, France. ''And we must seek to progress while upholding that tradition.''</p>
        <p>''WE are heirs to a tradition,'' said Bruno Duteurtre, who heads Moet &amp; Chandon's enological research laboratory in Epernay, France. ''And we must seek to progress while upholding that tradition.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Duteurtre and three other executives from the 242-year-old concern, France's largest and most scientifically sophisticated Champagne house, spoke at a recent symposium in Manhattan about major technological gains that are expected to modernize production and possibly improve the quality of Champagne.</p>
        <p>Moet bottlings reflecting these innovations in production may be released in the early 1990's. Before final marketing decisions are made, the Champagne will have undergone testing by company enologists and trained amateur tasters. Ultimately, Moet said, the advances would be shared with the entire Champagne industry of France.</p>
        <p>Moet's tradition dates to Dom Perignon (1639-1715), a Benedictine monk at the Abbey at Hautvillers, which the company now owns. Considered the first person to have mastered the technique of creating and preserving Champagne's sparkle, he was also the first to blend grapes from many vineyards. Moet celebrates his name in its tete de cuvee - top of the line -Champagne, which sells for around $61.</p>
        <p>Moet's executives said that significant strides have been made in laboratory propagation of grapevines and rootstocks and in modernizing the antique process, known as riddling, that precedes the disgorging of dead yeast before bottles are shipped to market.</p>
        <p>Speaking to members of the wine trade and wine writers at the United Nations Plaza Hotel, the team described its technical efforts. Moet executives included Edmond Maudiere, the chief enologist, and Yves Benard, the chief executive officer.</p>
        <p>Through biotechnology, Moet has developed standardized grapevines it calls ''elite specimens.'' Alain Deloire, who directs Moet's viticultural research laboratory, explained the application of the cultivation in vitro - that is, in a test tube or jar - of grapevines and rootstocks.</p>
        <p>He said that 200,000 vines grown in the laboratory were being introduced yearly to replace 30-year-old vines on Moet's 2,000 acres, the largest holdings in the Champagne region.</p>
        <p>Technicians who reproduce plants start with tiny cloned vines and rootstocks certified free of detectable viruses, Mr. Deloire said. With propagation in vitro, one bud can yield up to 15,000 plants a year.</p>
        <p>French law and regional authorities tightly regulate and supervise every aspect of viticulture, so the company is proceeding cautiously with its innovations. Only approved vines and rootstocks that conform to traditional varieties are allowed in the vineyards.</p>
        <p>When Moet vines germinated in jars are ready for open-air conditions, they are acclimatized in a greenhouse, then grafted onto American rootstock that resists phylloxera, a plant louse that ravaged Europe's best vineyards in the 19th century.</p>
        <p>The entire experiment is called clonal selection. It takes three years for new vines to produce grapes usable for wine. So in 1988, three years after the first vines were planted, Moet will begin comparing grapes from in-vitro vines with those produced by the traditional method, mass selection, which accounts for 95 percent of the region's vines.</p>
        <p>''Growers have always made their own plant selections and removed buds for multiplication,'' Mr. Deloire said. ''This is done by looking through the vineyards for those plants that appear to be most productive and produce the best quality grapes. They rely especially on visual criteria to assess the health of these plants.''</p>
        <p>Moet said it hoped to establish clonal selection as a more predictable method of producing healthy vines and grapes and regular-sized crops. Once proved successful, Moet said, the technique is likely to have profound effects throughout the Champagne region. Fermentation is another focus of research. Yeast cells, which impart bubbles, aroma and flavor - in short, character - to Champagne, float free during long bottle aging. But in Moet experiments begun in 1985, yeast particles are captured in tiny brown alginate beads. These are formed when liquefied droplets of alginate, a gelatinous seaweed extract, and yeast come into contact with a calcium chloride solution.</p>
        <p>Unlike still wines, which undergo one or, at most, two fermentations, Champagne undergoes three.</p>
        <p>The first, in stainless-steel vats, transforms juice from chardonnay, pinot noir and pinot meunier grapes into alcohol.</p>
        <p>The second fermentation, also in steel vats, reduces the acidity. In the third, sugar and yeasts, which transform the sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide, are put into wine-filled bottles, which are then sealed.</p>
        <p>In Moet's final fermentation, a few hundred beads are inserted into sweetened wine. The netlike porosity of the beads allows nutritional exchanges between the wine and the yeast, leading to normal decay of the yeast cells.</p>
        <p>The beads also speed up riddling -the tedious six- to eight-week process of manually shaking, turning and tilting bottles so that cloudy yeast sediment (also known as the lees) gradually drifts down to the cork.</p>
        <p>The beads, however, fall in seconds in a single operation. Then, as before, the bottle's neck is dipped in brine at minus 13 degrees, and this deposit is frozen. Then the bottle is opened, and internal pressure expels the frozen pellet containing the sediment, leaving the wine crystal clear.</p>
        <p>Mr. Duteurtre said Moet and the Comite Interprofessional du Vin de Champagne, the organization of wine growers and producers, had conducted more than 200 tastings to compare Champagne treated by both riddling methods. A statistical analysis of the results, he said, showed no significant differences.</p>
        <p>Participants in the recent symposium had the opportunity to taste brut Champagne made both ways and, in a vote, preferred the more yeasty, bone-dry and fruity version made the new way.</p>
        <p>Mr. Duteurtre said Moet &amp; Chandon had begun manufacturing the alginate beads on a large scale and expects to apply them to part of its production in two or three years.</p>
        <p>Though Moet does not expect the revolutionary elimination of riddling to reduce the price of Champagne, it says that production will be speeded up, labor costs will be reduced and vast cellar space for additional production will be made available.</p>
