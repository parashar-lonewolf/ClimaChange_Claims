        <p>Scimitar-horned oryxes browse amid the grass and wildflowers of the valley, as their ancestors have for millennia on the African savannah. But this is not Africa, it is eastern Ohio. And the oryxes are here not in their natural niche in the food chain -- eating foliage and falling prey to predators -- but in another role. They are helping to make coal look green.</p>
        <p>The oryxes, a type of antelope, along with Hartmann's mountain zebras and other rare species graze on a reclaimed strip mine donated by the American Electric Power Company. They will soon be joined by elephants, rhinos and snow leopards, and the company proudly notes that at 9,200 acres the wild-animal preserve is the largest in North America.</p>
        <p>More than perhaps any other North American utility, A.E.P. needs to show an environmental conscience.  Of the one billion tons of coal that will be used in the United States this year, A.E.P. will use 45 million, more than anyone else, to serve seven million people in seven states from Virginia to Michigan. In this age of concern over acid rain and global warming, a coal-burning utility is a bit like a butcher shop in a village where the new religion is vegetarianism.</p>
        <p>True, A.E.P. is refining a generation and transmission system that is already very modern and efficient, and plans to spend well over $1 billion to comply with the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990, primarily for control of emissions believed to cause acid rain. But it is looking ahead with dread to the debate over the greenhouse effect. Many scientists say carbon dioxide emissions, which are larger from coal than from other fuels, could bring catastrophic changes in weather.</p>
        <p>Bruised by the Clean Air Act amendments, which imposed strict limits on sulfur dioxide emissions, and horrified at the idea of a tax on carbon dioxide emissions, like that proposed at the recent Earth Summit, A.E.P. is trying to demonstrate that it is an environmental good guy even if it does rely on coal for 89 percent of its fuel.</p>
        <p>Not only is the Columbus-based company emphasizing to shareholders and customers a 40-year program of land reclamation and tree planting at old mines like the one here; it is also on the cutting edge of cleaner ways to burn coal, as evidenced by an experimental plant in Brilliant, Ohio, and better ways to use electricity, like an energy-efficient bulb.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists praise many of these activities, but say A.E.P. has only dabbled in encouraging customers to use energy more efficiently through products like the bulb. While it has pilot programs for many kinds of efficiency improvements, utilities in New York, New England and California are spending heavily on large-scale efforts to promote efficient lighting, motors and refrigerators.</p>
        <p>FOR years A.E.P. executives assumed that geology was destiny. With its service area astride the heart of the continent's coal fields, the company has become so attached to coal that it not only burns it but also mines and transports it. Its rates are low, about 6 cents a kilowatt-hour, and the supply is reliable.</p>
        <p>But concerns about the greenhouse effect make the company wonder about its future. "Clearly, coal is following nuclear as being unacceptable to the public," said Dale E. Heydlauff, the vice president for environmental affairs, a post created by A.E.P.'s board last year. "It scares me as someone fairly young in the management of this company, trying to figure out what will be environmentally acceptable in the next decade."</p>
        <p>The question faces the whole industry, because the United States has about 30 percent of the world's coal. And coal comprises the vast majority of the country's fossil fuel resources, and about 60 percent of utilities' fuel.</p>
        <p>It is not clear what fuel A.E.P. could use instead. Nine percent of its power is from a nuclear plant, and it recently named E. Linn Draper Jr., who has a Ph.D. in nuclear engineering, as its president. But he said in a company newsletter, "Let me assure you that I do not have a set of reactor designs in my back pocket."</p>
        <p>Two percent of A.E.P.'s supply is hydroelectricity, for which expansion prospects are limited. Executives say solar power is simply not feasible here. There is not enough wind to make much of a dent. Burning corncobs would work, one executive calculated, if A.E.P. planted land equivalent to three-quarters of Ohio in corn. Natural gas is a possibility, but like most of the industry, A.E.P. is reluctant to bet on the future price.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, A.E.P. has only a toe in the water in the most widely used strategy, increasing efficiency.</p>
        <p>If not conservation or other fuel sources, how else can A.E.P. show its environmental commitment?</p>
        <p>Enter the oryx and other image-enhancing programs, a kind of corporate verdification. The company recently won a patent on a mixture of water and coal ash (currently sent to landfills) that can be pumped like a liquid into street excavations, and hardens in a few hours.</p>
        <p>THE reclaimed strip mine that is the oryxes' new home was donated by the utility in 1986, to a group called the International Center for the Preservation of Wild Animals. There are successes already: while fewer than 400 Cuvier's gazelles exist wild in their native north Africa, two were born here in early July.</p>
        <p>Other reclaimed land has been set aside by the company as campgrounds and for fishing and boating.</p>
        <p>The heart of the company's effort, however, is in technological advances toward more efficient generation and consumption. The company recently gained wide attention for financing the development of an improved compact fluorescent light bulb, called the electronic lamp, that illuminates with one-fourth the electricity of a conventional bulb. Unlike existing compact fluorescents, the "e-lamp" comes on quickly and without flicker; it lasts 20,000 hours, compared with 10,000 for existing fluorescents and 750 to 1,000 for standard bulbs. Smaller than existing compact fluorescents, the bulb will fit in many more fixtures.</p>
        <p>The progress in the lamp had been widely anticipated. But the sponsorship was a shock, because A.E.P. has always been regarded as an extremely conservative organization. Pierre Villere, who is commercializing the e-lamp, said hundreds of potential investors had turned him down.</p>
        <p>FINANCING the bulb would have been adventuresome for most utilities, but was a real departure for A.E.P.; the company's critics say that for years its environmental attitudes were more than simply conservative. "Neanderthal," said Jan Beyea, senior scientist at the National Audubon Society, recalling A.E.P.'s powerful lobbying against the Clean Air Act. "It's wonderful that they're doing this," he said of the e-lamp. "The shift has blown everybody over."</p>
        <p>The e-lamp investment, at $6.5 million, is a symbolic act for a company with a market capitalization of $10.5 billion, revenues last year of $5.046 billion and net income of $497.9 million. "It's going to be years before it has a bottom-line impact that I care about," said Sanford M. Cohen, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, with considerable understatement.</p>
        <p>The lamp is a departure for another reason: it represents a philosophy to which the company does not fully subscribe. In New York and California, utilities subsidize high-efficiency bulbs because if customers use less power, the utilities will burn less fuel and cause less pollution.</p>
        <p>But A.E.P.'s chairman and chief executive, Richard E. Disbrow, doubts that light bulbs, motors and air-conditioners that use less power are any substitute for new power plants. And besides, he said in an interview, "the leading advocates of demand-side management are companies that are short of generation." His company has a growing surplus of power, because its neighbors have built plants and its customers are suffering from recession, so additional kilowatt-hours cost very little.</p>
        <p>Instead of demand-side management, Dr. Draper, the president, stressed the efficiency with which the company generates electricity. A.E.P. uses less fuel to produce a kilowatt-hour than any utility in the country but one, Commonwealth Edison, which serves the Chicago area, because its plants are well designed and well maintained. Its transmission system is also highly efficient. The amount of power lost in transmission generally declines as voltage rises, and A.E.P. was the first to introduce 765-kilovolt transmission lines, the highest-voltage lines now in use in this country. Realizing that moving electricity is often easier than moving coal, A.E.P. years ago began putting its plants near its mines.</p>
        <p>As for pollution, Mr. Disbrow insisted that the greenhouse theory has not been demonstrated to the point where use of coal should be limited.</p>
        <p>But there is no blueprint for convincing Washington of that. There is also no clear alternative. "What do you do if you're sitting on 250 years of coal?" said Mr. Heydlauff. "If you look at our options, they are extremely limited."  FINDING A CLEANER WAY TO BURN</p>
        <p>BRILLIANT, Ohio</p>
        <p>Most power plants burn coal by pulverizing it and blowing it into a boiler, where it is burned to generate steam.</p>
        <p>But here on the banks of the Ohio River, engineers have ripped the guts out of a 46-year-old generating station to install an entirely different system, called pressurized fluidized bed combustion. The initial results show that the process is so clean and efficient that American Electric Power executives hope the technology will dominate the market for new coal plants.</p>
        <p>The plant, called Tidd, was retired in 1976 because it could not meet rising environmental standards. Engineers disconnected the old boiler and grafted on a smaller one in which coal is burned in a bed of limestone and ash; the process is called "fluidized" because the mixture bubbles like a fluid. The limestone absorbs more than 90 percent of the sulfur during combustion, and the operating temperature of 1,500 degrees is too low to allow much nitrogen oxide to form.</p>
        <p>Running through the bed are tubes filled with water. That water boils into steam, which is used to make electricity. Because the heat is transferred to the steam tubes by a solid, the fluidized bed, not a gas, heat transfer is enhanced and efficiency raised. Boiler exhaust drives another turbine to make more electricity.</p>
        <p>A quantity of coal that would make less than 37 kilowatt-hours of electricity in a conventional scrubber-equipped pulverized-coal plant makes more than 40 kilowatt-hours here, and carbon dioxide emissions from the pressurized fluidized bed plant total 1.89 pounds instead of 2.12 pounds, per kilowatt-hour. With a refined design, engineers think they can get 10 percent more kilowatt-hours out of the coal, and cut another pound of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour. Even before considering the greenhouse effect, the reductions in fuel and sulfur dioxide would make the system attractive, especially because construction costs may be lower than for a conventional plant.</p>
        <p>But the carbon dioxide output is still worse than that in oil- or natural gas-fired power production, making pressurized fluidized bed, like everything else in the coal world, contingent on the greenhouse debate.</p>
