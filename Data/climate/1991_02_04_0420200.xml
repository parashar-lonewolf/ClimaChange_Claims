        <p>Scientists have theorized that the greenhouse effect will warm the earth's climate most dramatically in the latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere above the tropics. Yesterday, some non-scientists in those latitudes theorized that this would not be an entirely bad thing.</p>

        <p>Scientists have theorized that the greenhouse effect will warm the earth's climate most dramatically in the latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere above the tropics. Yesterday, some non-scientists in those latitudes theorized that this would not be an entirely bad thing.</p>
        <p>"It's not too difficult to adapt to this climate change," said Therese Aylward, a 27-year-old actress from Greenwich Village who was reading Moliere in Central Park yesterday afternoon. She had planned to spend the day in the library, but the record-breaking balmy weather inspired a change in plans.</p>
        <p>"It seems like a crime to stay inside today," she said. "It's been so beautiful. It's phenomenal and yet a little frightening. It's a possible sign that the climate is changing. But the bad thoughts are at the back of mind. Mainly I'm enjoying it."</p>
        <p>The temperature in Central Park reached a high of 64 degrees at 3 P.M., breaking the previous record of 59 for the date, which was set in 1983. The sunny day brought out joggers, strollers, bicyclers, and even sunbathers.  Packed With Picnickers</p>
        <p>In Purchase, N.Y., on the campus of the State University of New York, teams were busy playing what plastic-disk connoisseurs consider the world's finest field game, Ultimate Frisbee, something of a cross between football and soccer. In Titusville, N.J., the barbecue season began at Washington Cross State Park, which was packed with hikers and picnickers.</p>
        <p>In Central Park, ice skaters wore T-shirts as they circled Wollman Rink, and there were shirtless sunbathers on lawn chairs near the Metropolitan Museum of Art. At the Central Park Zoo, the polar bears were a little friskier than usual, but Anthony Brownie, the zoo's animal supervisor, did not attribute it the weather.</p>
        <p>"Their mating season is beginning," Mr. Brownie said as he watched a couple, Gus and Ida, pawing each other. "They're only five years old, which is sort of between adolescence and adulthood, so at this point they're rehearsing for the real thing." But he said they and the other animals did not seem to be affected very strongly by the weather. 'A Much Better Mood'</p>
        <p>"The biggest behavioral change we're seeing is outside the exhibits," Mr. Brownie said. "The people are in a much better mood."</p>
        <p>But among the smiling throngs walking jacket-in-hand through Central Park, a few people had suspicions about the warm air.</p>
        <p>"The best we can do is enjoy it," said James Fonder, 32, a vocational student from the Bronx, "but it's crazy, getting this kind of weather in February. It's got to be a sign of the times. It could be a sign of Armageddon, especially when you think of what's going on in the Gulf and how that ties into the prophecies in the Bible. But I may be wrong."</p>
