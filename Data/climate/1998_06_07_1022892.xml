        <p>At Harry Knobbe's Feed Yards the other day, Senator Chuck Hagel was holding forth on the global economy, the Asian financial crisis and the International Monetary Fund with a dozen or so hog and cattle farmers.</p>
        <p>Here in Cuming County, one of the largest cattle-producing counties in the United States, the farmers were hanging on every word.</p>
        <p>''When the markets go down in Asia, it's not good for the United States and it's not good for Nebraska,'' Mr. Hagel said over sodas and sugar cookies, drawing approving nods and murmurs. ''They can't buy your beef, pork and feed grains.''</p>
        <p>Getting his fellow senators to focus on international matters is a lot tougher than holding that discussion with farmers in a state that exports $1.6 billion worth of farm products to Asia each year.</p>
        <p>''Many of my colleagues don't understand foreign affairs, they don't travel, they don't get out,'' Mr. Hagel said later. ''They're scared of taking trips that will be labeled political junkets. They don't have much interest, and they don't see the relevancy.''</p>
        <p>Translating the lexicon of Washington foreign policy into nuts-and-bolts realities for constituents and other senators is a steep challenge for Mr. Hagel. But even as the freshman Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, ranked 98th in seniority out of 100 Senators, he is proving an influential new voice in foreign affairs.</p>
        <p>At a time when the country is looking inward, Mr. Hagel, a 51-year-old self-made millionaire, is preaching the virtues of internationalism to Congress and the public.</p>
        <p>Reflecting his pro-business conservatism, he told a group of Omaha mortgage bankers, ''Foreign policy is not some theoretical, esoteric, Kissinger-esque thing hanging out there. It's foreign trade.''</p>
        <p>As crises from Kosovo to Pakistan threaten stability, Mr. Hagel says, ''now is the time for America to project its leadership.''</p>
        <p>In less than 18 months, Senator Hagel has helped broker a deal among his colleagues for approval of $18 billion in new financing for the International Monetary Fund. He forged an unusual alliance with Senator Robert C. Byrd, a West Virginia Democrat, to counter the Administration's backing of a treaty to combat global warming. And Mr. Hagel, an Army veteran twice wounded in Vietnam, has fought against the Pentagon's use of antipersonnel land mines.</p>
        <p>''I don't think I know of any freshman senator since I've been here who's done better work than he has,'' Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader and a longtime friend of Mr. Hagel's, said in an interview.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hagel has earned a reputation as a blunt consensus-builder who is willing to reach out to Democrats to cut a deal. ''He's conservative,'' said Senator Richard J. Durbin, an Illinois Democrat who drafted a health insurance bill with Mr. Hagel. ''But he's not one of the fire-breathing, steely ideologues.''</p>
        <p>Senator Hagel has also shown that he is not afraid to buck fellow conservatives on international security issues. He was an early supporter last year of the treaty to ban the use and production of poison gas, despite stiff opposition from rightist groups.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lott credits Mr. Hagel with influencing his decision to back the chemical weapons treaty. ''When I was getting really criticized by some of my own people,'' Mr. Lott said, ''Hagel gave me a handwritten note that said: 'Don't let the ankle-biters get you down. Do what's right, and I'm with you.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hagel has his critics -- particularly environmentalists who oppose his position on the global warming treaty. ''Hagel seems to be a new leader of the head-in-the-sand crowd on Capitol Hill who want to ignore critical environmental problems,'' said Gene Karpinski, executive director of United States Public Interest Research Group.</p>
        <p>The Senator started his political career in the early 1970's as an aide to Representative John Y. McCollister, a Nebraska Republican. There he struck up some valuable friendships: another young House aide named Trent Lott, and a young Republican Congressman, Thad Cochran, now the senior Senator from Mississippi.</p>
        <p>During Ronald Reagan's Presidency, Mr. Hagel served as deputy administrator of the Veterans Administration and was an influential backer of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Leaving Government, he became a founder of what grew into a large cellular telephone company, Vanguard Cellular Systems.</p>
        <p>In the emerging cell-phone business, and in consulting work later, Mr. Hagel became an outspoken supporter of free trade, installing cellular systems in Costa Rica, Saudi Arabia and Britain. He puts his net worth at about $6 million.</p>
        <p>A long-shot candidate for the Senate in 1996, he upset the popular Democratic Governor, Ben Nelson. With his military and overseas-trade background, he took aim at his first committee choice: Foreign Relations.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't hard to get,'' said Mr. Hagel, who is chairman of the International Economic Policy, Export and Trade Promotion Subcommittee. ''No one wanted to be on Foreign Relations.''</p>
        <p>From his sometimes lonely bully pulpit on the committee, he has criticized the Clinton Administration and its national security policies.</p>
        <p>''I'm not sure the President has ever had a philosophy about foreign policy or thought through what role the United States should have in the world,'' he said. ''The Administration's foreign policy has been to ricochet from crisis to crisis.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hagel's biggest challenge was shepherding the $18 billion financing for the I.M.F. through a skeptical Senate, a task Mr. Lott assigned him. Mr. Hagel learned a lesson in Senate hardball when opponents of the financing went around him to attach conditions that would have killed a delicate compromise.</p>
        <p>He enlisted a powerful ally, Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, to restore the original deal. The financing passed, 84 to 16, but the House has bottled up the package.</p>
        <p>Back in Nebraska, Mr. Hagel finds support for the I.M.F. among big exporters like Valmont Industries, an irrigation equipment and lighting pole manufacturer in the town of Valley. For these executives, the $18 billion for the I.M.F. is not even an issue.</p>
        <p>''If not the I.M.F., who would do it?'' asked Mogens C. Bay, chairman of Valmont. ''The United States can't do it alone.''</p>
