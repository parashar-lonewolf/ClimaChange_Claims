        <p>LEAD: An official of the European Community's executive commission said at a 124-nation environmental conference here today that the European nations could eliminate production and use of chemicals that damage the ozone layer of the atmosphere as early as 1996 or 1997, three to four years ahead of the goal they set on Thursday.</p>
        <p>An official of the European Community's executive commission said at a 124-nation environmental conference here today that the European nations could eliminate production and use of chemicals that damage the ozone layer of the atmosphere as early as 1996 or 1997, three to four years ahead of the goal they set on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Carlo Ripa di Meana, the community's environment commissioner, also suggested that developing countries would need financial aid to retool their manufacturing plants if a worldwide ban on such chemicals takes effect by the end of the century. He said Europe should give it to them.</p>
        <p>''I would like total elimination well before the end of the century, maybe in 1996 or 1997,'' Mr. Ripa di Meana, an Italian, said. His proposal surprised his British hosts, his fellow European delegates and those from other countries around the world.</p>
        <p>William Reilly, the head of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, cautiously said he was optimistic that the industry could find substitutes well ahead of the deadline that President Bush set a day after the Europeans acted - a full phaseout of chlorofluorocarbons and halons by the end of the century, if safe substitutes can be found.</p>
        <p>''I feel strongly it should be 5 years rather than 11,'' said another American delegate, Senator Albert Gore Jr., Democrat of Tennessee. ''Each year we delay means 10 more years before the levels of harmful chemicals in the atmosphere come down.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly also said the authorities should consider whether methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride should also be added to the list of restricted chemicals, as some delegates here suggested. Thatcher Opens Conference</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, who opened the conference today by telling delegates, ''Do not set your sights too low,'' convened it to persuade more developing countries that the dangers would affect them, too. But it was not yet clear today that they were persuaded.</p>
        <p>''For white-skinned people, every one-percent ozone depletion increases by three to five percent the number of people who contract non-melanoma skin cancer,'' Dr. Robert Watson, a scientist with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, told the delegates today. He estimated that the amount of ozone that will be lost in the next few decades because of the chemicals already in the atmosphere at five to seven percent in high latitudes during winter.</p>
        <p>Mohammad Ilyas, a delegate from Malaysia, said: ''Skin cancer doesn't seem to occur in tropical countries, which have been by and large bystanders. But we should recognize that if the end result is an increase in ultraviolet radiation, the maximum will occur in our region.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ripa di Meana said he would consult with officials from developing countries here today and Monday. None from those with the biggest plans to develop industries that use chlorofluorocarbons - India, China and Brazil - spoke today, but a Chinese scientist, Wei Dingwen, suggested that natural sunspot cycles might account for the ozone ''hole'' observed over the Antarctic in recent years, and that it would diminish over the next few years. Alarm Is Expressed</p>
        <p>Scientists, government officials and legislators from the United States and Britain spoke in alarming tones about rapid depletion of the ozone layer and the contribution to the global ''greenhouse effect'' made by chlorofluorocarbons. They emphasized that the 1987 Montreal agreement to reduce them by 50 percent by the end of the century did not go far enough.</p>
        <p>Scientists said that just to prevent further depletion in the ozone layer would require an 85 percent cutback, which was Mrs. Thatcher's original proposal before the European ministers outdid her in Brussels last week.</p>
        <p>Western scientists said at the conference that the complete destruction of 97 percent of the ozone layer over the Antarctic would continue every winter for the next 50 to 100 years even if all chloroflurocarbon production and use stopped right away.</p>
        <p>Chlorofluorocarbons are still used as aerosol propellants in European countries and worldwide as solvents, as coolants in refrigeration systems and as expanding agents in the manufacture of insulating foam. The chlorofluorocarbons release chlorine atoms into the atmosphere, where they rise to the stratosphere and, under the right conditions, interact with sunlight and clouds to destroy ozone molecules, continuing to do so for years. Halons Are Not Covered</p>
        <p>Halons, used in fire extinguishing systems, were not covered in last week's European decision but were in Mr. Bush's, Mr. Reilly said.</p>
        <p>The Europeans agreed last week to bring down chloroflurocarbon use by 85 percent ''as soon as possible'' and asked the Common Market's executive commission to formulate an amendment for the Montreal agreement and present it to a review meeting to be held in Helsinki in May. Mr. Ripa di Meana said his suggestion was the first step.</p>
        <p>Representatives of E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company and Atochem, a French chemical manufacturer, said at the conference that work on acceptable chemical substitutes containing far less chlorine - hydrofluorocarbons - was proceeding.</p>
        <p>Du Pont announced today that it had developed two long-term candidates to replace cfc-113, a chlorofluorocarbon commonly used by the electronics industry as a cleaning agent, and that it would introduce a series of other new products over three to five years starting in 1990.</p>
