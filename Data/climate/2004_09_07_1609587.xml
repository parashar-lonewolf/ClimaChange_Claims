        <p>The Drain or the Dump?</p>
        <p>Q. Which does less harm to the environment: putting kitchen waste, like unusable food, into a garbage disposal or into the trash, which ends up in a landfill?</p>
        <p>A. Assuming the ground organic materials end up in a sewage plant, where they can go through biological treatment, it is better to send them through a garbage disposal into the drain, in the opinion of Dr. Allen Hershkowitz, senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council.</p>
        <p>''At a landfill, these materials wind up causing methane gas emissions and contributing to the breakdown of other cellulose materials, which release greenhouse gases,'' Dr. Hershkowitz said.</p>
        <p>He noted that the methane-producing microorganisms called methanogens that are associated with organic garbage act on other materials in a landfill so that they also release hazardous air emissions, some of them carcinogenic.</p>
        <p>''Basically you do not want wet organic material in a landfill,'' Dr. Hershkowitz said. ''Landfills should be kept dry. You do not want landfills to break down. They are supposed to be entombed.''</p>
        <p>Noxious landfill gases are sometimes captured for use as fuel, but there is also the potential problem of toxic liquid runoff, even if the landfill has a liner. A good alternative to either the drain or the dump is composting organic waste if possible, Dr. Hershkowitz said. ''That will not add load to sewage treatment plants,'' he said.</p>
