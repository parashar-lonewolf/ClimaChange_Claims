        <p>Destructive Ivy</p>
        <p>Q.  Is English ivy destructive and dangerous to trees and houses? Even if it pulls off a little bark, or some mortar, are bricks unaffected? Or does it destroy masonry and sap the life out of a living tree?</p>
        <p>.  Slowly but surely both the tree and the building will be sorry they couldn't move to get out of the way. Ivy won't pull off tree bark unless you try to remove it by brute force, but as it spreads upward and throughout the canopy, it shades out the tree's inner leaves. None of those leaves are there just for decoration -- the tree needs all the food they can make. A trunk covered by ivy can also make it hard to see structural damage from other sources. It isn't that ivy attacks in the way that twining vines can strangle a tree; ivy does its damage inadvertently.</p>

        <p>Q.  Is English ivy destructive and dangerous to trees and houses? Even if it pulls off a little bark, or some mortar, are bricks unaffected? Or does it destroy masonry and sap the life out of a living tree?</p>
        <p>.  Slowly but surely both the tree and the building will be sorry they couldn't move to get out of the way. Ivy won't pull off tree bark unless you try to remove it by brute force, but as it spreads upward and throughout the canopy, it shades out the tree's inner leaves. None of those leaves are there just for decoration -- the tree needs all the food they can make. A trunk covered by ivy can also make it hard to see structural damage from other sources. It isn't that ivy attacks in the way that twining vines can strangle a tree; ivy does its damage inadvertently.</p>
        <p>You and I may think ivy is beautiful on buildings, but the Ivy League grounds and buildings managers at Harvard and Yale agree it's a problem. Ivy grows small rootlets, appropriately called holdfasts, which make a glue that dissolves some of the mortar between bricks. Worse, the ivy traps moisture, dust and debris next to the building. Between acid rain and the decomposition of the debris, the acidity next to the building increases. That causes further damage to mortar as the carbonates in it dissolve. All buildings with mortar eventually need re-pointing, replacing worn mortar. Ivy makes it happen sooner.</p>
        <p>Parthenocissus tricuspidata, commonly called Boston ivy because it was used to cover Harvard's brick buildings, is at least deciduous. In the winter, snow and ice could drop off and the walls could dry out.</p>
        <p>Since English ivy is evergreen, it never takes a break.</p>
        <p>Waiting for a Bloom</p>
        <p>Q.  Last year in Hawaii I purchased two cattleya orchids to be mailed home. The orchids lasted a short time, but have had no new blooms since. One is in the bathroom, where it gets light and air; the other is in a sunny room. I water only when dry. What should I be doing differently?</p>
        <p>A.  Maybe nothing. Cattleyas and their many hybrids bloom only from new growth and most flower only once a year. There are many cattleya hybrids on the market and each different hybrid always blooms at about the same time. Generally, they bloom sometime between late winter and early summer, so maybe yours just isn't due yet.</p>
        <p>Two conditions are paramount for cattleyas to flower: enough light and a change in temperature between day and night. Cattleyas need more light than other common orchids, so a southern window is best. From November through March they need direct sun, but the rest of the year give them bright light, not sun. Leaves that turn pale yellow are a sign of too much light. Leggy, thin growth means too little light. Temperatures need to drop 10 or 12 degrees at night or the orchid won't set flowers. Low 60's at night is ideal, but it's the change that really matters.</p>
        <p>If you picked the bathroom for humidity rather than light, move the plant. Humidity in a bathroom is too variable. It is better to put the pot on a wide tray of damp pebbles to increase the humidity consistently right around the plant.</p>
        <p>The pseudobulbs, those large swellings at the plant's base, store water. Don't put orchids on a schedule, let them dry between waterings. When you do water, water thoroughly, and avoid getting water in the sheath, which can prevent flowering. Feed with one-quarter-strength balanced fertilizer every other watering. Flowering sheaths grow from the pseudobulbs, and protect the flowers until they are nearly ready. There's swelling and lengthening, and then one day there they are.</p>
