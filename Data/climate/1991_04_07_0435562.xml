        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Paul Goldberger's article "Two Reasons for Dancing in the Streets of New York"  [ March 17 ]  should have arranged for legions of relief dancers, generations of them, if the celebration of the March 1991 plan for the Penn Yards along the Hudson River is to commemorate anything more than what it truly is -- just another plan. Numerous designs and projects have preceded it and Trump City, its immediate predecessor; some even before the then far-advanced "Litho City" of about 50 years ago. A published history referred to the abandoned Penn Central rail yard as a "nursery for dreams."</p>
        <p>Such long-vacillating architectural visions in New York are certainly not unusual -- they number in the hundreds and probably encompass a major portion of the city's architectural efforts. But cheering the current railroad yard proposal is unusual. Not just from the lack of any meaningful direction for its advancement, but because current movement is in the</p>
        <p>opposite</p>
        <p>direction. Instead of "relocating" the roadway, a major rebuilding of the existing structure is about to proceed, and the potential for a huge park land development is another pleasant dream when we consider that the dilemma for the future will be how to maintain existing parks.</p>
        <p>Does anyone actually believe that the $70 million newly renovated structure will be removed and the roadway relocated this century? The coalition of community groups should be congratulated for their imaginative design, but will the design be appropriate at a time well into the future?</p>
        <p>Other goals and needs may then be of a much higher priority for this very large railroad yard area. For instance, environmentalists, concerned about the greenhouse effect and global warming, warn about potential rising water levels at the shoreline. This might require that the development be placed on stilts. Not to worry. The planning department's Special Manhattan Landing District, covering almost as large an area and planned well over a decade ago, though likewise unrealized, was also to be partially placed on stilts.</p>
        <p>As housing, economic and social conditions in the city continue to decline and their ills compound each other, perhaps rationality and reason will return. What if this very large, repetitiously planned area, which has nevertheless so long remained a wasteland, could meanwhile provide a good deal of badly needed housing through mobile home placement? When the long-abandoned railroad yards really reach a point in time for actual renewal, the mobile installation could be moved to some other long-established wasteland. SEYMOUR B.
