        <p>LEAD: Scientists have found that in January and February 1989, levels of protective ozone in the stratosphere near the North Pole were 25 percent lower, on the average, than in surrounding regions.</p>
        <p>Ozone in the stratosphere protects living things from harm caused by the sun's ultraviolet rays. The rays can cause skin cancer and eye cataracts in humans and they harm a variety of plants and animals, scientists say. Ozone is destroyed by chlorofluorocarbons, common industrial chemicals widely used in refrigerants, air-conditioners, fire extinguishers and solvents.</p>
        <p>Two months ago most of the world's nations agreed to stop producing chlorofluorocarbons by the end of the century. Ozone is constantly being created and destroyed naturally, and scientists say ozone levels should begin to return to natural levels once the ozone layer is no longer assaulted by destructive chemicals.</p>
        <p>The latest findings, reported in today's issue of the British journal Nature, were based on an analysis of measurements of ozone and other chemicals made from high-altitude aircraft flying from Stavanger, Norway, toward the North Pole. The 14 flights last year from Jan. 3 through Feb. 10 were made at altitudes of 9 to 12 miles. They were organized and supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Science Foundation, the Chemical Manufacturers Association and private industry.</p>
        <p>Zone of Maximum Depletion</p>
        <p>As in the Antarctic, the area of maximum ozone depletion in the Arctic occurs within a vortex, or whirlpool, of air that forms over the pole in winter. Scientists analyzing the data from the Stavanger flights found there was 12 percent to 35 percent less ozone inside the vortex than outside it, with an average for the region of about 25 percent at those altitudes. This, they said, translates to about a 6 percent reduction in ''column ozone'' - the total amount of ozone over any given spot on Earth. By contrast, ozone losses over the Antarctic have been as high as 90 percent at high altitudes, with column ozone losses reaching 50 percent.</p>
        <p>''The Arctic is not likely to ever see the precipitous decline in ozone found in the Antarctic,'' said Dr. Michael Proffitt of the N.O.A.A. Aeronomy Lab and the University of Colorado at Boulder, the chief author of the study appearing in Nature.</p>
        <p>The reason, he said, is that the northern vortex does not last as long as the southern one because of differing atmospheric conditions. The Arctic vortex usually lasts from November to mid-winter, the Antarctic vortex from April or May to October or November. The longer a vortex remains in place, the more ozone is destroyed.</p>
        <p>''What we have found is certainly not an ozone hole in the sense of what we found in the Antarctic,'' said Dr. Proffitt, who has been involved in Antarctic studies as well as Arctic ones.</p>
        <p>Scientists have known for some time that ozone-destroying chemicals were in the Arctic stratosphere, and earlier, less extensive analyses of the Stavanger data had suggested a modest ozone loss there, on the order of 12 percent to 17 percent. Data gathered by balloons, similarly less extensive, came up with local losses of 15 percent to 25 percent. The latest study, Dr. Proffitt said, ''pegs the ozone loss a good bit harder'' while coming up with a somewhat larger ozone depletion.</p>
