        <p>Coca-Cola's top executive apologized to European customers today in response to a growing public outcry over its slow response to a soft-drink contamination that apparently made hundreds of people sick in Belgium.</p>
        <p>The apology by M. Douglas Ivester, chairman and chief executive of Coca-Cola, the world's leading soft-drink company, came as French Government officials said that 80 people there had complained about nausea, fever and headaches. French stores removed more than 50 million bottles and cans from shelves today, and bans on the sale of Coca-Cola products remained in force for a second day in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.</p>
        <p>After meeting with Coke executives in Paris, French officials refused to relax their prohibition and delayed any public comment until Thursday. Officials in the three other nations said they were awaiting more information from the company about what exactly had caused the problem.</p>
        <p>In Germany, the authorities began checking the origin of Coke products and removing any that had been bottled in France or Belgium. And a growing number of consumer groups in Germany and elsewhere complained that Coca-Cola had been opaque and unreassuring in its public explanations.</p>
        <p>The company's trouble comes at a time Belgium is reeling from a scandal over cattle infected with dioxin, a cancer-causing chemical that contaminated feed grain used on many Belgian farms. The scandal forced the resignation of Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dahaene, as well as the nation's health minister.</p>
        <p>It also comes amid an increasingly heated argument between Europeans and the United States over American-produced genetically modified food products, which many Europeans want to ban, and over hormone-treated beef, which is before the World Trade Organization.</p>
        <p>Responding to the concern in Europe, Coke's chief, Mr. Ivester, released a statement from the company's Atlanta headquarters today seeking to reassure customers. ''The Coca-Cola Company's highest priority is the quality of our products,'' he said. ''One hundred thirteen years of our success has been based on the trust consumers have in that quality. That trust is sacred to us.''</p>
        <p>Promising to thoroughly to investigate, he said company executives ''deeply regret any problems encountered by our European consumers in the past few days.''</p>
        <p>The tone of his remarks were considerably more conciliatory than the response from company executives in Brussels, who had insisted that Coca-Cola Company drinks did not pose a health problem despite the complaints of nausea and headaches. The company has attributed the reactions to what it called bad carbon dioxide used at a plant in Antwerp, Belgium, and to fungicide from packing crates found on cans at the French port in Dunkirk.</p>
        <p>But Coke executives in Europe did little public campaigning to reassure consumers. There were no signs today of advertising and or more comprehensive explanations of how the problem was to be solved. ''I have the strong feeling that nobody is really informed,'' said Ivo Mechels, a spokesman for Test-Achats, a nonprofit consumer research organization in Brussels.</p>
        <p>Those views were echoed in Germany. ''We couldn't get any information from the company until we had made scores of calls,'' said Kristiana Schafer, a nutritional scientist at the Consumer Center, a Government-financed consumer advocacy group.</p>
        <p>About 100 people in Belgium, including 38 schoolchildren, complained of fever, nausea and headaches after drinking Coke products on Monday. Belgium ordered all Coke products off store shelves on Monday, followed by France, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.</p>
        <p>The bans affect all Coke drinks, as well as most of the company's other soft drinks and juices: Diet Coke, Fanta, Sprite, mineral water and Minute Maid fruit juices.</p>
        <p>In Germany, where Coca-Cola operates 32 bottling plants, Government inspectors found no signs of contamination today and said drinks bottled in the country were still safe. But they warned about products bottled in Belgium or France and brought over the border. In the city of Trier, local officials seized 2,500 cans with French markings.</p>
        <p>Although the problem affects less than 1 percent of Coca-Cola's global sales, it is the biggest product recall in the company's history. It remains unclear how seriously it will affect Coca-Cola over the longer term.</p>
        <p>Robin S. Socha, a consultant at Control Risks Germany, which advises corporations on responding to crises, said companies were frequently caught between the desire to inform their customers and their fear of losing business.</p>
        <p>''In crises like this one, a company has to draw a line,'' the consultant said. ''It has to take care of its business and protect its clients at the same time. Whatever they say, they will either anger customers by saying too little or endanger their business.''</p>
