        <p>NASA's emergency plan to use the International Space Station as a safe haven for shuttle astronauts whose craft cannot safely return to earth would carry a high risk of failure if it were ever tried, according to internal space agency documents.</p>
        <p>The documents say the space station lacks adequate support systems and supplies to assure that its own occupants and a shuttle crew could stay alive for more than a few months at best and a few weeks at worst -- not enough time, under many possible situations outlined in the documents, to carry off a rescue plan.</p>
        <p>While some of the astronauts could return to earth on the Russian Soyuz craft, which is docked at the space station, it is far from certain that they could all be rescued.</p>
        <p>In a sense, the information in the new documents simply underscores what the nation has always known about spaceflight but tragically relearns from time to time: It is a risky business. The documents, which have not been made public, were presented on June 9 to NASA officials in charge of spaceflight and safety as part of the effort to return the shuttle fleet to space by next spring. They were given to The New York Times by senior NASA employees who say that the current state of agency planning puts astronauts and the space program at undue risk.</p>
        <p>A space station program official said that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration believed it could launch a rescue vehicle in time to bring back all crew members.</p>
        <p>''That's why we study these situations so intensively,'' said the official, Mark Uhran, the assistant associate administrator for the station program. ''So we can be sure we have captured all possible scenarios and have a plan in place so we can ensure that the web of our safety net is adequate.''</p>
        <p>A NASA spokesman, Allard Beutel, said the plan was ''a backup plan to a backup plan to a backup plan,'' and very much a work in progress. The space agency, he said, has worked to eliminate the kind of launching debris that doomed the shuttle Columbia in 2003, so the need for such a rescue becomes increasingly remote.</p>
        <p>A station rescue plan was recommended last August by the independent board that investigated the loss of the Columbia and its crew of seven. Since then, NASA has held out the emerging space station plan as something that could make spaceflight safer and has used the existence of the plan as part of its justification to return to flight before it has developed a full capability to repair damage to the shuttle's thermal protection system in orbit. And an independent panel that is monitoring NASA's progress since the Columbia accident has found that the safe haven plan ''is becoming increasingly important in NASA's decision-making for return to flight.''</p>
        <p>The employees who provided the documents said the agency was cutting corners on cost and demanding that its schedule of space station construction be followed, with safety an afterthought. ''Despite all the hype about the so-called culture changing at NASA,'' said an employee who provided the documents, ''recent events have given us little confidence that NASA management will do the right thing.'' The documents contain ''very realistic scenarios that are not survivable,'' he added.</p>
        <p>The two presentations were given at a meeting of NASA's Spaceflight Leadership Council, a group of top officials who are overseeing the agency's efforts to return the shuttle fleet to space. Each is labeled preliminary. The space station presentation states that the ability to support the crew and the amount of survival time ''are almost impossible to predict with certainty.''</p>
        <p>The first presentation describes the current status of rescue plans, known within NASA as contingency shuttle crew support. The document states that several critical systems aboard the space station have no adequate backup, including oxygen generation, carbon dioxide removal, food, water and waste removal.</p>
        <p>Providing adequate backup cannot be done, the document says, ''without unreasonable impacts to mission content and agency costs.''</p>
        <p>It provides three estimates of survival time with the combined supplies from the crippled shuttle and station based on a launching date of March 6, 2005. The most optimistic estimate, 86.7 days, is based on a series of events in which all major systems aboard the station work perfectly. The worst case, which envisions the failure of a critical system like carbon dioxide removal, gives the combined and stranded crew just over 23 days' survival -- too little for even optimistic estimates of readying a rescue craft.</p>
        <p>The document also provided a middle estimate, known as the engineering estimate, which relied heavily on past experience -- in particular, the many problems with the space station's life-support systems. One of the station's oxygen generation units failed upon installation, and spare parts for the carbon dioxide removal system are running low, among other continuing concerns.</p>
        <p>Taking such factors into account, the engineering estimate suggests that the crew could survive 59.6 days. That is potentially less than the time required to prepare a second shuttle flight to rescue the crew of the damaged shuttle. ''If critical systems not available,'' the presentation chillingly states, ''loss of crew occurs.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Uhran, the NASA official, said that the failure of a critical system like carbon dioxide removal could occur only after a highly unlikely chain of failures, including the loss of the Russian and American carbon dioxide removal systems. Precisely because of internal reviews like the one on the space station rescue plan, he said, ''we are actually improving the safety system characteristics.''</p>
        <p>NASA said last month that it had developed a way for shuttle crews to repair small cracks and gouges in the wings of up to 4 inches, but acknowledged that it had not found a way to patch holes the size of the one that doomed Columbia, which was estimated to be 6 to 10 inches across. A special boom to inspect the surface of the orbiter once it reaches space is also behind schedule, NASA officials said in their progress report.</p>
        <p>The repair and rescue plans have yet to be approved by an independent task force headed by two former astronauts, Thomas P. Stafford and Richard O. Covey. A spokesman for that commission, David Drachlis, said two of its members, including Mr. Covey, attended the June 9 meeting, and that the task force ''has not completed an assessment'' of the information.</p>
        <p>John Logsdon, the director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University and a member of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, said that his board had recommended the rescue-at-station plan, but not as an alternative to repair. ''There were a whole chain of recommendations and this was, in our view, the last resort,'' he said.</p>
