        <p>LEAD: AFTER the General Assembly failed to act this year to ban the use of plastic foam food packaging, more than a dozen communities have started to take the matter into their own hands.</p>
        <p>AFTER the General Assembly failed to act this year to ban the use of plastic foam food packaging, more than a dozen communities have started to take the matter into their own hands.</p>
        <p>''Everybody was going to wait for state action,'' said Jean Blue, an assistant to the Mayor of Hamden, John L. Carusone. ''But people are ready for this now. This is an idea whose time has come.''</p>
        <p>Last month Hamden became the first community in the state to impose such a ban. Under the Hamden ordinance, food wrappings made of polystyrene will be banned beginning March 1. Violators will be subject to fines of $100 a day and jail terms of up to three months.</p>
        <p>Polystyrene, the material used in throwaway hot-drink cups, fast-food containers and supermarket meat trays, has drawn the ire of groups concerned with the growing problem of solid-waste disposal. It accounts for only a small percentage of all solid waste, but polystyrene's critics have attacked it because it is used for only a short time and then thrown away and because it is not readily degradable and persists in the environment for a long time.  Limits on State Purchases</p>
        <p>The General Assembly's Environment Committee discussed banning foam containers last session, but the measure never reached the full Assembly. But the Assembly did enact a law prohibiting the state government from buying, after Jan. 1, 1991, products packaged in plastic foam made with chlorofluorocarbons, chemicals some scientists say are responsible for destroying the earth's ozone layer.</p>
        <p>This week, Stamford and New Haven will consider ordinances to ban plastic foam food packaging made from polystyrene, and New Britain, Southbury, New Milford and Cheshire have begun drafting their own measures.</p>
        <p>Eleven other communities, including Danbury, New Fairfield, Hartford and Wallingford, have requested copies of the Hamden ordinance as the first step in adopting their own, Ms. Blue said.</p>
        <p>Officials in Stamford are considering a ban on polystyrene food packaging used by fast-food restaurants, company and institutional cafeterias, and supermarkets. On Thursday, the health committee of the Representative Town Meeting will consider evidence for and against such a ban at a public meeting at 7:30 P.M. at the Government Center, 888 Washington Boulevard.  'Our Biggest Worry'</p>
        <p>''The stuff going into our waste stream is the least of our concern,'' said the committee's chairwoman, Ruth H. Power. ''It's the coffee container that gets thrown into Long Island Sound or that gets tossed in the street and washes down a grate and helps clog a storm drain that's our biggest worry.''</p>
        <p>''You don't like to go around banning this and banning that,'' Ms. Powers added, ''but it doesn't seem industry is responding terribly quickly to the problem.''</p>
        <p>''This is only a small step,'' she said of the proposal. ''But if we don't start working now to save the environment, we may be too late.''</p>
        <p>In New Haven on Tuesday, two members of the City Council, Steven G. Mednick and Elizabeth McCormack, will formally propose a ban on polystyrene food packaging for that city.</p>
        <p>''We'd combat the image of America as a disposable society,'' Mr. Mednick said. He said that while plastic foam makes up about 5 percent of the waste in New Haven, it is disproportionately represented in litter because it does not break down. As Mr. Mednick walked a city street recently explaining his proposal to a local businessman, he was able to impress his point as the two kicked foam hamburger containers out of the way.</p>
        <p>Explaining the timetable for his proposal, Mr. Mednick said it would probably take four to six weeks before a draft would be finalized and several more weeks for it to go through public hearings. But he said that there was widespread support and that he expected such an ordinance to be on the books by November. If so, he added, the ban would be phased in over six months.  Business and Plastic</p>
        <p>''We don't want to give industry too much of a jolt,'' he said. ''We realize business has been using plastics for a long time, and we need to give them time to switch to biodegradable products.''</p>
        <p>Some businesses are also joining the movement and are switching from polystyrene coffee cups, plates and containers to paper.</p>
        <p>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty in Hartford and the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics in Groton are phasing out the use of foam containers in their cafeterias and coffee shops. And Alvaro da Silva, the president of Silva Associates of Ansonia, which operates eight Burger King franchises in southwestern Connecticut, said his restaurants were switching from plastic to paper coffee cups.</p>
        <p>Together, the companies use several million cups each year, as well as uncounted other disposable products, their spokesmen said. They have made the switch even though paper costs more than three times as much as plastic.</p>
        <p>''As environmental issues go, this is really just a very small thing,'' said A. Steven Perelman, a spokesman for Aetna, which estimates it uses 3.5 million plastic foam coffee cups a year. ''But we've all got to start doing something about the problem.''</p>
        <p>John T. Kirkland, the environmental manager for Electric Boat, said, ''We share the concern of the city that, as the landfill is filling up, we should be reducing what is going into it.'' Paper cups are biodegradable and can be used in a composting operation, Mr. Kirkland added.</p>
        <p>Mr. da Silva said he had received no complaints from his Burger King customers about the paper cups, although they have less insulation than the polystyrene ones, which makes them more likely to burn a customer's hand and causes the coffee to cool off quicker.</p>
        <p>''Where we have already changed, we haven't seen any drop in sales,'' Mr. da Silva said. ''People realize what we're trying to do and they support it.''</p>
        <p>Representatives of the plastics industry have challenged an ordinance similar to Hamden's in Suffolk County, L.I., where it is law. The Suffolk law is awaiting a court-ordered environmental impact statement, but since it was approved in March 1988, it has served as a national model for such measures and prodded the development of plastics recycling centers.</p>
        <p>Harvey R. Schatten, the general manager of Eastern Paper of New England in Stamford, which distributes both plastic and paper disposable products, says the environmental efforts are misguided.</p>
        <p>''A lot of the paper coffee cups are plastic coated, and they're just as nonbiodegradable as plastic,'' Mr. Schatten said.</p>
        <p>He also said there was no reason to switch to paper, because it was feasible to recycle plastic and he cited plastic recycling operations in New York and Massachusetts as proof.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schatten said that a year ago 90 percent of his sales were for plastic foam and 10 percent for paper. Now, he said, the ratio is nearly 50-50.</p>
        <p>''All they're doing is creating a tremendous shortage of paper,'' Mr. Schatten said, ''If everyone switches over, they're won't be enough paper to go around.''</p>
        <p>But environmentalists cite a number of reasons to ban plastic foam. They point out that it is made from petroleum, a nonrenewable and largely imported resource, while paper is made from trees, which can be replanted.  Costly and Bulky</p>
        <p>While the plastic foam can be recycled, it is so light and bulky it is impractical to transport to a recycling center, they say, because of the space it takes up and the resulting high cost per pound.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists also want to reduce reliance on plastic foam because the state is switching from landfills to trash-to-energy incinerators, and plastics, when burned, give off more pollutants than paper.</p>
        <p>Thomas J. Turick, the environmental manager for the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, said he knew of no Connecticut-based companies, besides Aetna and Electric Boat, that were phasing out the use of plastic foam.</p>
        <p>''To say we should ban plastic is not a great idea until we know what we're going to replace it with,'' Mr. Turick said. ''Whatever we replace it with might not be as easy to recycle.''  The Price of Foam</p>
        <p>But Anne R. Gobin, a senior environmental analyst with the State Department of Environmental Protection's recycling section, said plastic foam is not easy to recycle. ''You have to look at the economic viability of recycling, and it's very costly to collect plastic foam and deliver it to a recycling center,'' Ms. Gobin said.</p>
        <p>She said the best change she had seen was at school kitchens in Cromwell, which switched from plastic foam food containers to ceramic dishware. ''Now there is no waste generated at all, because the plates and cups are washed and reused.''</p>
        <p>Kathleen Provencher, a spokeswoman for William W. Backus Hospital in Norwich, said her hospital's switch to paper cups in the cafeteria meant a big jump in price. The cups are more expensive - 3.2 cents each instead of 0.8 cents - and employees have been using two cups at a time for coffee so they do not burn their hands, she said. That practice dropped after the employee newsletter suggested wrapping a napkin around the cup, she added.</p>
        <p>Kelly A. Anthony, a spokesman at Lawrence and Memorial Hospitals in New London, said the hospital cafeteria switched to paper for infrequent customers and began selling ceramic cups to regulars, with a coupon good for five free refills.</p>
        <p>Mr. Anthony said the hospital was also considering using cloth diapers in its maternity ward, instead of disposable ones.</p>
