        <p>The life-protecting ozone layer may now be thinning above President Bush's summer home in Kennebunkport, Me., as well as other parts of the Northern Hemisphere. That gives Mr. Bush a compelling personal reason to regain the initiative on an issue of global importance.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, detectors aboard a converted spy plane flying over New England and eastern Canada recorded the highest level of chlorine monoxide, an ozone-destroying chemical, ever measured anywhere around the globe. The level was half again as large as the amount recorded over Antarctica, the site of the infamous ozone hole discovered in October 1985.</p>

        <p>The life-protecting ozone layer may now be thinning above President Bush's summer home in Kennebunkport, Me., as well as other parts of the Northern Hemisphere. That gives Mr. Bush a compelling personal reason to regain the initiative on an issue of global importance.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, detectors aboard a converted spy plane flying over New England and eastern Canada recorded the highest level of chlorine monoxide, an ozone-destroying chemical, ever measured anywhere around the globe. The level was half again as large as the amount recorded over Antarctica, the site of the infamous ozone hole discovered in October 1985.</p>
        <p>The team of scientists who reported these findings in Washington on Monday could not predict when an ozone hole might open above North America. But they said that the level of ozone-thinning "precursors" -- chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's) from refrigerants and aerosol sprays, as well as other chemicals -- might soon expose large parts of the globe to increased cancer-causing ultraviolet rays from the sun.</p>
        <p>The warnings seem cause enough for Mr. Bush to accelerate the phasing out of ozone-depleting chemicals made by U.S. manufacturers and to reconvene an international conference to strengthen existing global agreements.</p>
        <p>The U.S.'s record on ozone depletion has been mixed. On the plus side, it helped produce the Montreal protocol of 1987, which mandated a 50 percent reduction in CFC's by the year 2000. Three years later, confronted with even more alarming evidence, it agreed with other Western nations to eliminate CFC's by the year 2000. American industry swiftly developed substitutes.</p>
        <p>Since then, however, the Administration has faltered. In 1990, developing nations asked for a modest $20 million to convert to substitutes for CFC's. Washington refused, partly at the behest of the former White House chief of staff, John Sununu, who feared that help on CFC's would lead to demands for greater help later to reduce gases that cause global warming.</p>
        <p>And last November, when a United Nations panel suggested that ozone depletion was occurring three times faster than previously supposed, the Administration remained silent.</p>
        <p>Senator Albert Gore, Democrat of Tennessee, charges that the Administration is ignoring the Clean Air Act, which requires the Environmental Protection Agency to speed elimination of ozone-destroying chemicals when scientific evidence indicates that current plans are inadequate. He also asks the President to reconvene the signatories of the Montreal Protocol to end production of dangerous chemicals by 1995.</p>
        <p>These are reasonable requests. The causes have been identified. The remedies are at hand. And the issue, for Mr. Bush. is getting close to home.</p>
