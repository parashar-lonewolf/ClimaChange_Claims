        <p>LEAD: ONCE upon a time, when power was cheap and everyone thought progress meant using more of it, utility companies used to advise architects and developers on ways to raise electricity consumption in new buildings. The theory was that workers could be more productive in buildings with more artificial lighting and with cooling systems built without regard for the sun and other natural factors.</p>
        <p>ONCE upon a time, when power was cheap and everyone thought progress meant using more of it, utility companies used to advise architects and developers on ways to raise electricity consumption in new buildings. The theory was that workers could be more productive in buildings with more artificial lighting and with cooling systems built without regard for the sun and other natural factors.</p>
        <p>These days, however, when high costs and environmental restrictions make the building of new generating plants extraordinarily difficult, the utilities have a different message for builders and designers: Buildings can do very well with less electricity, much less.</p>
        <p>And commercial landlords, who now see electric costs as the largest single expense of operating a building, are increasingly receptive. Even builders of speculative structures, who put up an office building without ever planning to pay the operating expenses and then sell it to a buyer who wants to pay the lowest possible price, are beginning to see the virtues of designing for energy efficiency, utilities say.</p>
        <p>To push conservation along, some utilities are even making direct payments to builders to help them make the added investment needed to acquire extra efficient equipment that can save substantial amounts of energy.</p>
        <p>The Consolidated Edison Company, for one, expects to spend about $1 million this year in helping landlords in a conservation district it has established in the East Midtown area of Manhattan running from 44th to 52d Streets east of Fifth Avenue.</p>
        <p>In one case, Con Edison is expected to give more than $50,000 to Van Dorn Realty to spend on measures to cut electric consumption in its office buildings at 733 and 825 Third Avenue - in effect, paying its customer to buy less.</p>
        <p>''The Con Edison rebate program is a pilot project designed to test whether rebates will encourage our customers to install more efficient equipment and significantly reduce the demand during summer peak periods,'' said Alfred M. Ornstein, director of commercial and industrial conservation services. ''This may be less expensive than investing in new power plants and distribution systems.''</p>
        <p>Northeast Utilities, which serves most of Connecticut and a portion of western Massachusetts, is taking an even broader approach, paying handsomely for a variety of energy-saving measures.</p>
        <p>The company, which expects to spend almost $20 million on conservation in both residences and commercial buildings this year, will provide free audits for houses, apartments and factories, free installation of weatherstripping, subsidies for insulation, and free sample high-efficiency light bulbs. The company's program includes providing the owners of commercial buildings with ''contract arranger services,'' by paying for engineering studies, evaluating bids for making energy improvements and identifying financing options.</p>
        <p>''We'll hold their hands,'' said Earl F. Taylor Jr., Northeast's director of conservation programs.</p>
        <p>''I've been talking about energy efficiency for years,'' said William Ellis, chairman of the board of Northeast Utilities. ''This financial incentive will make the difference.''</p>
        <p>He made his remarks at a news conference last spring where he and officials of the state and environmentalists described a new program of efficiency incentives. Last month the program was adopted by several other utilities around New England.</p>
        <p>Northeast adopted the program because cutting growth in electric demand reduces the need for new power plants, which saves them money. Con Edison has a related problem; it has plenty of generating capacity at present, but will need to spend millions of dollars on improving its distribution system in the East Midtown area unless it can cut the growth in electric load.</p>
        <p>The irony faced by the utilities is that they will sometimes add generating or distribution equipment that will not pay for itself for 20 years, while their customers will reject efficiency improvements that have a payback period of only four or five years. Cash payments from utility to customer is one way to bring those values into balance.</p>
        <p>Many utilities across the country offer subsidies to residential customers to help them use electricity more efficiently. But heavy subsidies for commercial buildings are unusual.</p>
        <p>A striking feature of the Northeast Utilities program is free assistance to architects. In a guidebook designed for architects, the utility says that it has 50 energy-saving ideas for a new 60,000-square-foot suburban office building that could cut load by as much as 37 percent, without raising construction costs.</p>
        <p>Getting in at the preconstruction stage is important, according to Douglas Foy, director of the Conservation Law Foundation, an environmental organization that negotiated the conservation plan with Northeast. The reason is that unless energy needs are considered, he explained, a developer is building the equivalent of a ''gas guzzler.''</p>
        <p>''Unlike cars,'' he stressed, ''these things last for 50, 100 or 200 years. They doom you.''</p>
        <p>Northeast used a computer program developed by Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory for the Federal Department of Energy, and analyzed the effects of various changes. Some were not obvious at first glance.</p>
        <p>For example, Northeast found, builders often face a choice between tinted glass and reflective glass to hold down the effect of the summer sun. The reflective glass is more effective, but also more expensive to buy.</p>
        <p>But the study suggested that choosing the reflective glass is cheaper because it permits installation of a substantially smaller air-conditioning unit. The savings on the less expensive air-conditioner will more than pay for the reflective glass.</p>
        <p>The study also reported that attic and wall insulation, one of the most common energy-saving investments in a new house, was a poor investment in an office building. The reason is that holding in the heat in winter is not nearly as important as taking out the heat that builds up in summer, from lighting and equipment as well as from the sun.</p>
        <p>Another idea was ''workstation conditioning.'' Just as engineers now plan differing light levels for different areas - lower in corridors, for example, and higher at the desktop - the Northeast study proposed heating and cooling ducts at desktop, and less summer cooling and winter heating where no one spends long periods, like hallways.</p>
        <p>IT also recommended ceiling-height windows, which permit daylight to penetrate deeper into a building. Moreover, the study pointed out, ''lightshelves'' under the windows could bounce light up on to the ceiling and even farther into a room.</p>
        <p>These measures can be combined with electronic switches that vary the intensity of the lights according to how bright it is outside, adding only what is needed to reach a preset illumination level. The study showed that this strategy could cut annual electric consumption nearly 10 percent.</p>
        <p>The computer showed that part of the gain was in less electricity needed for lighting, and part was because air-conditioning costs are saved whenever lights, which generate heat, are removed.</p>
        <p>''Everybody's going for lighting,'' said Peter M. Miller, a research analyst at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, based in Washington. ''There's a really good payback on it, and it's easy to do, incrementally or all at once.'' But, he said, landlords and tenants still resist the idea of spending a lot for devices they are used to buying cheaply; a high-efficiency bulb, for example, can be a bargain at $40, but that is not what people are used to. ''Part of it is just nonrational behavior,'' Mr. Miller said.</p>
        <p>He pointed out that President Reagan on June 29 signed a new law that raises the minimum allowable efficiency for a ballast, the device between the building wiring and the light tube. The standard, which takes effect in 1990, will require 10 percent more efficiency than in older models. A third design that is 25 percent more efficient is available, but not called for in the law.</p>
        <p>Even so, building owners and tenants will save $11 billion by 2000 because of the new law, the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy estimated. Many savings can be achieved in older buildings, and New York is a prime candidate for such savings because its power costs are the highest of any major city in the nation.</p>
        <p>Savings can be hard to come by, said Harvey Brickman, first vice president of Tishman Realty and Construction, because the increasing number of computers not only use a lot of power, but throw off heat as well.</p>
        <p>But the incentive is there, he said, because annual electricity costs can run from $2.80 to $3.30 a square foot. In contrast, he said, the whole operating cost of a building is typically $7 to $9 a square foot a year. Energy is sometimes the largest single operating expense, he said, the only rival being personnel costs.</p>
        <p>But conservation can be expensive, Mr. Brickman pointed out. He said that by offering rebates, Con Edison is ''tacitly admitting that it costs you money to save energy.''</p>
        <p>Some efficiency improvements are put in place without subsidies, however.</p>
        <p>At 733 and 825 Third Avenue, for example, workers for Van Dorn Realty, a subsidiary of the Durst Organization, are making changes in lighting that are invisible to tenants, but evident on the electric bill. Joshua L. Durst, the property manager, said that before the rebate program, he was switching to more efficient lighting equipment whenever a floor was remodeled, but he was not replacing the others.</p>
        <p>Mr. Durst said the two buildings together have about 5,000 ceiling-light fixtures, each with four 40-watt fluorescent tubes and two 40-watt ballasts. At a cost of $60, including installation, the two ballasts can be replaced with models that do the same job but use only 20 watts each, and the 40-watt bulbs can be replaced with 34-watt models that give the same light.</p>
        <p>THE result is to cut the energy use of each fixture from 240 to 176 watts. According to Mr. Durst, the lights are on for 14 to 15 hours a day, so the savings would come to about 900 watt-hours daily. At current prices, that comes to about 14 cents per fixture per day, or $17,700 a year.</p>
        <p>But Con Edison is paying $25 of each $60 conversion. So with the job a little more than half done, Con Edison has paid him $27,000.</p>
        <p>''We expect this is slightly better than break-even project, but I emphasize slightly,'' he said in an interview. He said he was inclined to do the job out of concern for the environment as well as for the financial gain. ''With the nuclear waste, the acid rain and the imported oil, it just doesn't make any sense to use more electricity,'' he said.</p>
        <p>To save money, he has already had tinted plastic sheets applied to the insides of the windows, to reduce heating from the sun. But Mr. Durst said that he had found limits to energy saving technologies.</p>
        <p>For example, Mr. Durst was interviewed while he sat in the office of the building manager, which is equipped with a motion detector that turns out the lights if it senses that the room is empty for more than a few minutes. The hallway outside the office has a similar sensor, and the lights there blinked on and off as office workers came through.</p>
        <p>Mr. Durst said that he had tried the sensors, which cost $200 each to install, in some other offices, but that ''it's a very difficult sell to tenants.''</p>
        <p>Employees do not like them because they do not like coming into a dark room, he said. So their use is limited to bathrooms and some hallways and mechanical rooms that are not used by the public.</p>
        <p>''You don't want to be on the cutting edge of this technology,'' he explained.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Durst said he wished Con Edison would extend its conservation zone to take in another building his company owns, at 205 East 42d Street, now facing the possibility of needing new wiring for additional computers and other electric devices unknown when it was built, in 1928.</p>
        <p>The Northeast Utilities conservation program dwells heavily on lighting and cooling in new office buildings, but will also focus on existing homes, offices and factories. The company expects to spend substantially more in the future; it will recover the money, plus profit, through electric sales.</p>
        <p>If the conservation increases its spare capacity, the utility can then rent that surplus to neighboring utilities that are short of power - at a profit.</p>
