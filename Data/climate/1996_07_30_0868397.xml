        <p>AROUND 250 million years ago, something so devastating occurred that about 90 percent of Earth's animal species were wiped out. While the cause of this greatest of all mass extinctions remains uncertain, a new study by biologists and geochemists suggests that a huge upwelling of carbonated water from the depths of the oceans may have played a lethal role.</p>
        <p>That mass extinction, at the end of the Permian period, reshuffled Earth's genetic deck, making way for the rise of dinosaurs in the subsequent Mesozoic era and widening the niches available for the mammal-like reptiles destined to become ancestors of the human race.</p>
        <p>Because the events that brought the Permian period to a close occurred so long ago, much of the fossil record of the period has been erased. Scientists confront difficulties in interpreting the causes of the Permian mass extinction, which ushered in the Triassic period, the first period of the Mesozoic era, the  age of dinosaurs.</p>
        <p>The Permian mass extinction probably had causes very different from those that killed off the dinosaurs 185 million years later.</p>
        <p>A popular theory of the dinosaur extinctions 65 million years ago is that an  asteroid or comet hit Earth, drastically changing the global climate, restricting habitats and squeezing many species to extinction. The theory is supported in part by the discovery of high levels of iridium in sediments marking the end of the Mesozoic era -- levels more consistent with the iridium content of asteroids than with terrestrial soil.</p>
        <p>But no such iridium anomalies associated with the Permian extinction have been found, and there is wide agreement that the Permian "great dying," which wiped out nearly all ocean life and took a heavy toll on land animals, was caused by something different.</p>
        <p>One theory is based on the fact that at about the same time as the Permian mass extinction, a gigantic volcanic eruption covered much of present-day Siberia with lava. Many scientists suspect that the poisonous gases released by  that event, called the Siberian Traps eruption, coupled with the climatic effects of the large-scale release of volcanic carbon dioxide, could have had deadly global consequences.</p>
        <p>But another idea was proposed in a report published in the current issue of the journal Science by four scientists: Dr. Andrew H. Knoll of Harvard University's Botanical Museum; Dr. Richard K. Bambach, a geologist at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg; Dr. Donald E. Canfield of the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology in Bremen, Germany, and Dr.  John P. Grotzinger, a planetary scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In their report, they examine the possibility that soda water may have been the main culprit in the Permian catastrophe.</p>
        <p>The researchers argue that the patterns of extinctions and of the types of calcium-carbonate sediments laid down at the end of the Permian period are consistent with a global turnover of deep ocean water, which would have brought  immense amounts of carbon dioxide to the surface, both dissolved in surface sea  water and released as a gas into the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>A similar association of ice ages with unusual carbonate sediments occurred at least four times during the Proterozoic era more than 570 million years ago,  the scientists believe, suggesting that their theory applies to other pivotal episodes in the earth's early history. Although the sedimentary record of the Permian extinction event has been swallowed up in many parts of the world by geological processes, well-preserved sediments from that time have been found in Japan, they said.</p>
        <p>Although carbon dioxide is a normal respiration product of animal metabolism, too much of this ubiquitous compound is dangerous, particularly for marine animals. Carbon dioxide dissolved in blood forms carbonic acid, which acidifies  the blood. Too much of it causes acidosis, which can kill animals, especially marine organisms with low metabolic rates.</p>
        <p>Dr. Knoll and his associates do not suggest that carbon dioxide released into the air could have reached high enough levels to have directly killed land animals. But air unusually rich in carbon dioxide could have produced a heightened greenhouse effect, trapping energy from sunlight and raising global temperatures, which would be dangerous to some animals and would destroy habitats needed by others.</p>
        <p>Although the special conditions that may have made the global ocean surrounding the Permian supercontinent Pangea a potential killer probably do not exist in modern oceans, certain inland lakes with high levels of carbon dioxide  dissolved in deep water pose threats to people and animals living nearby.</p>
        <p>In 1986, Lake Nyos, a beautiful blue crater lake in northwestern Cameroon in  Africa, killed more than 1,000 people as well as all the cattle and other animals along its periphery. There were so few nearby survivors of the catastrophe that eyewitness accounts remain sketchy, but some witnesses said a fountain that might have reached 500 feet in the air had suddenly shot from the  lake, enveloping the area in a lethal mist.</p>
        <p>Dr. Youxue Zhang of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and other scientists investigating the catastrophe concluded that the victims had all died of asphyxiation. Relatively heavy carbon dioxide gas erupting as a fountain from the lake displaced the air above it and deprived nearby animals and people  of oxygen, they said.</p>
        <p>Dr. William C. Evans of the United States Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif., concluded a report about the incident with the comment that "during its  most violent phase the fountain would thus resemble a scaled-up geyser more than an uncorked champagne bottle."</p>
        <p>The trigger for sudden dangerous upwellings of carbon dioxide in Lake Nyos and several similar lakes in Africa and Indonesia remains a subject of debate. Once carbon-dioxide-rich water under high pressure is forced by something to rise, the pressure is released and the dissolved gas forms bubbles. The resulting foam then rises quickly, creating a chimney through the water that bursts forth as a fountain.</p>
        <p>The ancient Permian ocean probably did not erupt with fountains of soda water but released carbon dioxide much more gradually, perhaps as small bubbles like those trickling from a glass of stale club soda.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bambach of Virginia Polytechnic said he did not believe that the release  of gas would have looked very dramatic. "It might have taken several centuries for the overturned carbon dioxide to escape," he said in an interview, "but the  process could have increased the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by five or six times."</p>
        <p>He and his colleagues believe that the injection of carbon dioxide into the air associated with the Permian extinctions occurred in two separate pulses, the first occurring two million or three million years before the close of the Permian period, and the second at the very end of the period. Besides carbon dioxide, such an upwelling of deep ocean water would probably have brought to the surface large amounts of the poisonous gas hydrogen sulfide, which would have created further survival problems for many species.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bambach and his associates propose several possible explanations for a catastrophic carbon dioxide upwelling.</p>
        <p>In a scenario favored by the team, the process begins with a warm global climate in which oceanic vegetation absorbs large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis, then dies and deposits the carbonate as sediments in deep ocean water where there is little or no life-sustaining oxygen. The resulting depletion of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere reduces the atmospheric greenhouse effect, and global cooling takes place.</p>
        <p>The tectonic movement of crustal plates, meanwhile, pushes up high mountains, and the upper slopes are subjected to freezing temperatures. Glaciers and icecaps form, many of them reaching the shores of the Permian supercontinent Pangea.</p>
        <p>The glaciers begin chilling the top layer of nearby sea water, which becomes  denser than the warmer underlying water. That creates an instability in which surface water begins to sink, displacing the deeper water that is heavily charged with carbon dioxide. At a certain critical point, the slowly rising carbon-dioxide-rich water begins to form bubbles; that accelerates its rise, saturating water near the ocean surface with the gas and releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Marine animals with calcium carbonate shells or skeletons build them from carbon dioxide and dissolved calcium compounds. But they are particularly sensitive to overdoses of carbon dioxide, called hypercapnia. That, the scientists believe, accounts for the extinction of countless ocean species at the end of the Permian period. Among the victims were the last of the trilobites, highly successful three-lobed arthropods that had been predators of  the seas for 375 million years. Many terrestrial species also died off, including moschops, an ox-like vegetarian reptile.</p>
        <p>Surviving the Permian mass extinction by the skin of their teeth were some of the cynodonts, mammal-like reptiles believed to have been ferocious predators with high metabolic rates. Their metabolism, Dr. Bambach and his associates say, would have helped to protect them against the effects of hypercapnia, which was  fortunate for their descendants. Paleontologists believe that these animals may  have been warmblooded and that they eventually evolved into mammals.</p>
        <p>Dr. David M. Raup, a former professor of paleontology at the University of Chicago who has championed theories explaining mass extinctions in terms of asteroid impacts, said he found the new theory of carbon dioxide upwelling plausible. "It's a good thing that someone has brought up this possibility," he  said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bambach said that it was possible that the oceanic upheaval he believes responsible for the Permian mass extinction could have been touched off by the impact of an asteroid, although there is little evidence for such an impact. The trigger might also have been the rearrangement of tectonic plates, thrusting up mountains that created the glaciers he theorizes caused the chilling of the ocean surface water and the subsequent turnover of carbonated water. The Siberian volcanism occurring at the same time would have added still more carbon dioxide to the global biosphere.</p>
        <p>"Whatever the cause," he said, "our model fits the patterns of extinction and carbonate sedimentation better than other hypotheses, and I think it has to be taken seriously."</p>
