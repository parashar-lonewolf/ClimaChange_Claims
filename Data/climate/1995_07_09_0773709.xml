        <p>It may be just coincidence that Orson Scott Card has completed his grandly conceived Homecoming Saga in five books, the same number as the Torah. Then again it may not.</p>
        <p>Mr. Card, a practicing Mormon, has always been dead serious about the religious under pinnings of his science fiction -- which, for all its trappings of space travel and sentient computers, might more accurately be labeled "conscience fiction." EARTHBORN (Tor/Tom Doherty, $23.95), like the previous volumes in the Homecoming series, takes as its theme what moral philosophers call right action: how to live in an imperfect world without violating one's own moral principles.</p>
        <p>The setting is a greatly changed Earth, more than 40 million years in the future. Competing for living space are three species that speak a common language: the sky people, winged bipeds whose common appellation of angels refers to their ability to fly, not to any moral distinction; the earth people, commonly called diggers and often treated as slaves; and the middle people, a group of humans who have returned from a long exile on a distant planet called Harmony.</p>
        <p>The action focuses on the children of Motiak, a wise king; the children of Akmaro, a saintly priest; and the children of Pabulog, a brutal warlord. As in all Mr. Card's novels, the characters spend a great deal of time talking about what they are going to do and why they are going to do it. Far from generating tedium, these long philosophical discussions crackle with tension because all the participants bring conflicting emotions to their tasks, and even the most self-involved are awed by the enormous consequences of their actions.</p>
        <p>Can the three species be forced to live in peace by royal decree? What is the proper relationship between reason and intuition? Does God exist? In Mr. Card's hands these questions are inseparable from more personal matters like jealousy, bigotry and the lust for revenge. Finally, of course, the only question that matters is the existence of God -- known here as the Keeper of Earth. Some characters periodically dream what are known as "true dreams." Mr. Card is at his best in his sympathetic portrayal of a young dreamer who experiences these flashes of inspiration but, under the influence of a charismatic mentor, tries to deny their power and relevance in the name of reason.</p>
        <p>As drama, "Earthborn" suffers from the strength of its virtues. Precisely because the author sympathizes so deeply with all his characters, he is unable to create a truly formidable villain, an evil adversary along the lines of Milton's Satan. As a result, the conflicts he so skillfully sets in motion are resolved too easily, giving his extended parable, in the end, a fatal air of unreality.</p>
        <p>KALEIDOSCOPE CENTURY (Tor/Tom Doherty, $21.95), by John Barnes, is moral drama of another sort. Joshua Ali Quare, born in 1968, is liberated from a nightmare childhood by K.G.B. agents who offer him a Faustian bargain. In exchange for loyalty to a cause he has good reason to despise, he receives a "vaccination" that bestows a form of immortality -- immunity from all disease and periodic renewal of brain and body tissues. The only drawback -- aside from having to bully and murder on demand -- is that every 15 years or so he suffers a massive memory loss, so that he must periodically rediscover who he is.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barnes knows how to wring suspense from this predicament, as Joshua pieces together a disquieting personal and global history that extends into the 22d century. Along the way the author slips in the information that Joshua's world is not our own but a close historical variant; among other discrepancies, Boris Yeltsin is killed in an abortive anti-Soviet "revolution" just a few years before President Bush dies of something called "mutAIDS."</p>
        <p>These, however, turn out to be minor details in the story Mr. Barnes chooses to tell. That story has to do with Joshua and Sadi, his comrade in arms, who ends up running the "Organization" that the K.G.B. evolves into. While Sadi, as his name implies, is the more committed sadist, both men take satisfaction in their professional duties. Joshua's idea of compassion is to kill his victims quickly, unless he feels like "serbing" the women first. His entire philosophy is summed up in the sentence "Power is being able to touch and not be touched, and I've got that."</p>
        <p>To call Joshua -- one of the nastiest characters in recent science fiction -- immoral is like calling the sun hot. Utterly detached from normal society, he comes across as a pastiche of cultural relativism, a depressingly small-minded Faust whose moral compass points only to himself. He suffers no retribution, gains no insight, admits to no ambition other than survival. Having forced myself to finish this book, I can only hope there is no sequel.</p>
        <p>By all rights, KAMIKAZE L'AMOUR: A Novel of the Future (St. Martin's, $20.95), by Richard Kadrey, ought to be depressing. Set in a near-future North America that is being eaten alive by a mutant rain forest, this novel resembles a cross between the hopped-up cyberpunk of William Gibson and the enervated despair of J. G. Ballard. The suicidal protagonist is born with synesthesia, a neurological condition that causes him to perceive sound as light, tastes as shapes and so on. He barely survives childhood, becomes a rock star and then drops out, seeking creative solitude if not necessarily sanity under the new name Ryder.</p>
        <p>Plot, characters and ambience notwithstanding, "Kamikaze L'Amour" manages to be upbeat in a decadent sort of way, like the best rock-and-roll. Maybe it's the exuberance with which the author borrows inspiration from sources as disparate as chaos theory and Andre Breton. Maybe it's the insouciance with which everyone greets the onrushing eco-disaster. Asked why the jungle has penetrated as far north as San Francisco, Ryder's new friend Frida says: "Global warming or global cooling. Sun spots. All kinds of theories. Personally, I think nature just hates a vacuum. And what else would you call America for the last 20 years?"</p>
        <p>Ryder's quest takes him from a zoned-out San Francisco to a weirded-out Los Angeles, where he meets his former lover and manager, the terminally mad Nikki. If despite all the depressing details you are still crazy enough to expect a happy ending, you will be happy to know that the author shares your expectations.</p>
        <p>I wish I liked CELESTIS (Tor/Tom Doherty, $21.95), by Paul Park, better. Mr. Park writes well, and he is not afraid to tackle big themes, as he proved in his earlier series of novels, "The Starbridge Chronicles," which looked at the often surprising consequences of human governance.</p>
        <p>His new novel deals with interstellar colonialism. Having wasted the resources of Earth, human colonists settle on a new planet that harbors not one but two sentient species -- the only others known in the universe. The two alien species are locked into a symbiotic relationship that to human eyes resembles the bond between master and slave. In a new twist on the classic tactic of divide and rule, the colonists sever the symbiosis by treating the "aboriginal" slaves with drugs that render them deaf to the telepathic commands of their "demon" masters. Once the latter are exterminated, the humans begin exploiting the former. When the aboriginals rebel against their new masters, all the relationships are revealed in a new light.</p>
        <p>Mr. Park tells this story from a number of points of view, including that of both alien species. In so doing, he hints at the essential strangeness of a different way of thinking without sentimentalizing the difference. But for all his success in suggesting the Other, he saps the life from the final confrontation by presenting the human colonists as caricatures of insensitive American capitalists and ineffectual British civil servants.</p>
