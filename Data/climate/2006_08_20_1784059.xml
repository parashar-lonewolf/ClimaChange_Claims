        <p>CONNECTICUT'S aging public school buildings leak heat in the winter and cold air in the summer, giving them a failing grade in energy efficiency in a report released this month by the Institute for Sustainable Energy at Eastern Connecticut State University in Willimantic.</p>
        <p>William Leahy, the chief operating officer of the institute, said that about 90 percent of the schools in the state were built at least 25 years ago, when standards for energy efficiency were less stringent.</p>
        <p>The study analyzed energy bills for 119 of Connecticut's 1,026 public schools, taking into account the size of the schools and how much of the year they stay open.</p>
        <p>Connecticut schools scored 26 on a scale of 100, ''which makes them among the least energy-efficient schools in the country,'' the report said. (The report is available at www.sustainenergy.org; click on the High Performance School Initiative icon at the bottom of the home page.) The average score nationwide, as determined by energy-use data from the United States Department of Energy, is 50.</p>
        <p>The report estimated that Connecticut's public schools spent 35 percent more on energy costs during the last school year than the previous one.</p>
        <p>Inefficient systems are not the only reason energy costs are rising. Gas and electric prices have risen in the last two years, but improving school construction would help ease that burden, Mr. Leahy said. Bringing Connecticut's schools up to the national average would save school districts $46 million in annual energy costs, the report said.</p>
        <p>The problem with the state's schools is that they were built when energy was cheap and efficiency was not foremost on the minds of builders, Mr. Leahy said. Large single-pane windows and slab construction allow hot and cold air to seep out, he said, and old heating and air-conditioning systems gobble energy. A few Connecticut schools, including the Barnard School in New Haven, which has solar panels on its roof, have been built to higher efficiency standards in recent years.</p>
        <p>The institute received public and private foundation grants for its report, along with money from the Connecticut Green Building Council, a nonprofit group that advocates improved energy efficiency in buildings. The council's board includes some building industry officials who focus on energy efficiency and school construction.</p>
        <p>Small school districts often want to build energy-efficient schools but lack the money, Mr. Leahy said. The institute is backing a bill in the State Legislature that would commit the state to providing funds to make school buildings more energy efficient, Mr. Leahy said. In New Jersey, similar legislation that was passed a few years ago has begun to pay dividends, he said.</p>
        <p>The Connecticut Legislature has already heard testimony on the bill, and some lawmakers want to vote on it by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>''In the long term, it could get us away from fossil fuels and toward more sustainable energy,'' said State Representative Steve Fontana, a Democrat from North Haven, who is co-chairman of the Energy and Technology Committee and is hoping that the Legislature will call a special session this year to deal with rising energy costs.</p>
        <p>The cost of a state program to finance energy improvements is ''hard to predict,'' Mr. Fontana said, but he said he thought it would quickly produce dividends.</p>
        <p>''It can be expensive, but it pays for itself several times over,'' he said. ''These things have a very short payback window.''</p>
