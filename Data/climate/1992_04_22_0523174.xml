        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Competitiveness is getting to be like the weather: Everyone talks about it, but no one does anything about it, and when they do they make things worse. "When to Wink at Price-Fixing" (editorial, April 4), your attempt to distinguish resale price maintenance from other kinds of price-fixing, is analogous to President Bush's stand on global warming.</p>
        <p>Like that view of the President, the argument that fixing retail prices will insure that customers get better service or more information relies on faith rather than logic. Retailers are most likely to pocket any additional profit resulting from fixed prices.</p>
        <p>Indeed, your example proves the fallacy of your argument. The manufacturer of a superior computer need not rely on resale price maintenance and the hope that retailers so subsidized will inform the public about the product's superior features. To insure that customers are given service, the manufacturer can authorize only those dealers that agree to provide it. To make sure customers are informed, the manufacturer can buy advertising, including point-of-sale displays and brochures.</p>
        <p>Of course, most manufacturers would prefer to take the simpler course of fixing retail prices, although that will almost certainly reduce sales and probably profits as well. Advertising requires an investment in the hope of later return. With fixed prices, the profit-per-item is increased, while lost sales are largely invisible. The end result is that the consumer pays more, while society suffers by wasting resources on overpriced goods.</p>
        <p>Three Republican Presidential administrations have effectively gutted the antitrust laws, which is one reason for the decline in American competitiveness. A statute easing prosecution of retail price-fixing would be a step in the right direction, for a change. JONATHAN J. MARGOLIS Boston, April 6, 1992 The writer is a lawyer.</p>
