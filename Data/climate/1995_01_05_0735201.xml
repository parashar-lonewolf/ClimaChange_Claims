        <p>Former Vice President Dan Quayle underwent an elective appendectomy yesterday at a hospital in Indianapolis and was resting comfortably, cracking jokes and asking for a hamburger shortly after the procedure, his office said.</p>
        <p>The appendix was removed in a minimally invasive procedure in which tubes with a tiny camera and surgical instruments are threaded into the abdomen.</p>
        <p>Mr. Quayle entered Indiana University Hospital on Monday for elective removal of an enlarged appendix that was detected in a CAT scan X-ray of his abdomen during an earlier hospitalization last month. That admission was for treatment of blood clots in his lungs that had caused pain and shortness of breath. Earlier, Mr. Quayle, who is expected to seek the Republican nomination for President in 1996, was reported on the mend and taking an anticoagulant drug to help prevent recurrence of the clots.</p>
        <p>In a statement about the surgery, Anne Hathaway, who is with Mr. Quayle's political action group, Issues '96, made no mention of a pathology report on the tissue that was removed in yesterday's operation. Doctors not connected to Mr. Quayle's case said it was a significant omission.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hathaway did not return calls to her office.</p>
        <p>The laparosopic procedure used in Mr. Quayle's case has been adapted over recent years from the techniques long used in gynecologic surgery. Surgeons now use laparoscopic techniques to do most gallbladder operations and an increasing number of appendectomies.</p>
        <p>A laparoscopic appendectomy is performed with the aid of a tiny camera threaded into the abdomen. Surgeons make several tiny incisions near the umbilicus, through which they insert narrow tubes. Then the tubes are used to introduce a fiber-optic camera, specially designed scalpels and other surgical instruments.</p>
        <p>Doctors not connected with Mr. Quayle's case said they were perplexed by the sparse information in the statements from his office. They said they assumed that one reason for using the laparoscopic technique in Mr. Quayle's case was that it would reduce the likelihood of bleeding, since he was at increased risk from the anticoagulant. The abdominal muscles that are cut in a standard appendectomy are usually spared in a laparoscopic procedure, helping to cut down on the risk of bleeding. The technique can also aid in a speedier recovery.</p>
        <p>Another reason is that a standard part of the procedure is to inflate the abdomen with carbon dioxide, thus allowing a surgeon to explore organs and tissues in the abdomen. Blood clots of the type Mr. Quayle developed sometimes occur in individuals with chronic conditions like cancer. The statement did not mention any evidence of diseased organs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Quayle's surgery was performed by a team headed by Dr. David Canal and Dr. Frederick Rescorla. In the statement, they said, "We expect Mr. Quayle to be up to a normal active schedule soon."</p>
