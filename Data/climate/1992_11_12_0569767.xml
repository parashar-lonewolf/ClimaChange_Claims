        <p>GEORGE BUSH, scourge of Ozone Man and the spotted owl, is looking for a new job. So now the air and water will be entrusted to more sensible folk, right?</p>
        <p>Maybe. President Bush actually played a better environmental game than he talked. He acted responsibly to protect -- dare one say it -- the ozone layer. He clamped down on acid rain. He even signed legislation to keep wetlands wetter at the expense of California's influential farmers.</p>
        <p>If President Bush's record looks better on reflection, the challenges to President Clinton look more daunting. For decades, Washington has been setting environmental goals, whose bills are only now coming due. And while White House rhetoric on the environment will no doubt veer toward the warm and fuzzy, the behind-closed-doors debates over how much to spend and where to spend it are not likely to be any less fierce in the new Administration than in the current one.</p>
        <p>On one side stand traditional environmentalists, who want to get on with the job of just saying no to polluters. On the other are economists and fellow travelers, who view a clean environment as a virtue -- but only one of many. And while some of the battles will be about how much crud is too much, others will be about the least-cost strategies for keeping it away from children and other living things.</p>
        <p>Traditionalists like their regulation plain, if not always simple: do it, and do it now. Economics types are partial to market-based plans -- taxes or freely tradable permits to pollute -- that appall the old-timers because they imply that some level of pollution is acceptable.</p>
        <p>The best guess is that President Clinton will choose an administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency who is not identified with either side -- Madeleine M. Kunin, the former Governor of Vermont, tops nearly everyone's list. And that suggests the big policy battles will be fought one at a time. Among those looming on the horizon:</p>
        <p>Farm runoff. The Clean Water Act has taken a giant gulp from the sewage and industrial waste once dumped into rivers and lakes. Most of the muck still flowing is largely unregulated runoff from farmland. Robert Stavins, a researcher at Harvard's Kennedy School in line for the top planning job at the Environmental Protection Agency, predicts that these "nonpoint" sources will be Topic A in reauthorization of the law.</p>
        <p>Traditionalists lean toward tough anti-runoff rules, possibly baited with grants to offset compliance costs. The economists' fix of choice would be effluent taxes or trading systems, in which polluters could buy the right to pollute from those who could cut runoff more cheaply.</p>
        <p>Robert Hahn, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, has already designed a trading system for southern Florida, where farmers are under court order to prevent fertilizer runoff from corrupting the Everglades. Estimated savings over the brute-force approach run as high as 80 percent.</p>
        <p>Infrastructure. For all the chatter about high-tech data networks and 300 m.p.h. trains, Congress and its suburban constituents are lusting for more money for highways. Dan Dudek of the Environmental Defense Fund thinks a scuffle is shaping over how big a slice of the infrastructure pie will go for environmentally benign mass transit. Perhaps more important, he sees a fight over whether new roads should pay their own way and whether Federal cash could be used as a lever to get cities to charge congestion fees for using roads at rush hour.</p>
        <p>Superfund. The widely applauded idea of Superfund is to clean up abandoned toxic waste without first pinning down who is liable for the bill. But the law also demands "permanent" solutions -- restoration of the sites to pre-industrial condition. And that, argues Lester Lave, an economist at Carnegie Mellon University, often means a multimillion-dollar incineration of debris and soil, where a less fastidious scrub and a sturdy fence would keep people out of harm's way.</p>
        <p>There will be a push next year for a standard that balances health risks with costs -- one that could save tens of billions of dollars. And as a portent of trouble to come, much of the opposition will come from businesses now making big bucks on the cleanup.</p>
        <p>Active waste sites. While abandoned dumps are absorbing cash by the billions, Paul Portney, an economist at Resources for the Future, thinks toxic wastes stored on working business properties could prove an even greater drag on the economy. To add waste or change storage methods, companies must now meet exacting modern standards for the entire site -- even if the old waste poses little threat.</p>
        <p>This rule could be modified without changing the law. But like much of the economists' agenda, it will not be altered without a sea change in the way Washington views the environment. And after decades of cleaner-is-better politics, that change will not come easily.</p>
