        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Daniel Akst may think that home values will continue strengthening (''In Long Run, Residential Real Estate May Beat Stocks,'' On the Contrary, May 5). But as a real estate developer who stopped building two years ago because of concerns about the market (clearly a bit early), I would point out some problems:</p>
        <p>* Real estate does not always go up in value. The positive forces affecting it now were in play in the early 90's when the entire industry almost went under.</p>
        <p>* You have to feed real estate -- by making mortgage payments and paying taxes, maintenance and utilities. Stock, by contrast, can just sit there until things come around.</p>
        <p>* Rental real estate is an interest rate play. Just a few percentage points change it from profit to loss.</p>
        <p>* Real estate is illiquid in a down market -- not because of the paperwork, but because nobody wants it.</p>
        <p>* Information on real estate is out of date. Everyone watches sales figures, but between sale and occupancy, the entire world can change.</p>
        <p>* There is not one kind of real estate. Big units, small units, this side of town, that side of town -- there are a thousand different markets dictated by a hundred different forces. The lovely lakeside recreational property next to ours sat empty and unsold for 12 years.</p>
        <p>If you are certain interest rates will always be low and that the economy will always be strong, have lots of disposable income to support empty units, have a complete grasp of demographics and are certain about the effects of global warming and where the next earthquake will be, only then is real estate for you.</p>
