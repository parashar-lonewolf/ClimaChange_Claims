        <p>Concern over a possible depletion of the protective ozone layer over the Northern Hemisphere as early as this spring has jolted politicians and commentators from Britain to Russia and prompted calls for more stringent environmental laws.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks scientists and environmentalists have debated the startling message that a weakening ozone shield is no longer just a problem in far-off Antarctica: it could be about to occur overhead, above densely populated zones.</p>
        <p>American and European researchers said in early February that they had detected alarming concentrations over the North Pole of the same synthetics that are believed to be depleting the ozone shield over Antarctica.</p>
        <p>With the chemical stage now set, they said, they expect to see similar damage around the Arctic Circle, reaching as far south as 50 degrees north latitude. Such damage, they said, would mean that more ultraviolet radiation would penetrate over Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, parts of Germany, Poland and Russia and North America down to the United States-Canadian border region.</p>
        <p>Higher doses of radiation can increase skin cancer, cause cataracts, impair the immune system and disrupt agriculture and natural ecosystems.</p>
        <p>The news has come as a shock to Northern Europe's environmentally aware public.</p>
        <p>In France, the weekly L'Express declared a "Threat Over Europe." The German weekly Der Spiegel asked: "The devouring of Ozone: Is this the last act?" In Denmark, Government officials went on television to calm people and urged them to use sunscreens and hats when spending a lot of time outdoors.</p>
        <p>Carlo Ripa di Meana, the environment commissioner of the European Community, last week put on bright green sunglasses and called for more laws to protect the environment. "European cities, for example, London, Amsterdam and Moscow, appear to have a very-high-risk future," he said.</p>
        <p>Official reaction has been quick. Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands immediately announced new deadlines for banning the chemicals that are widely blamed for destroying ozone. Setting the toughest deadlines anywhere, the three governments said they would halt production and use of such chemicals by the end of 1994. The United States had already decided to phase out the chemicals by 1996. Moving Up a Ban</p>
        <p>The 12-nation European Community, which normally has a more cumbersome gait, also acted swiftly. Environment ministers last week agreed to press for new cut-off dates for the harmful chemicals throughout the community. This month, a community decision is expected to bring forward the current ban two years, to 1995.</p>
        <p>Such new deadlines will put enormous pressure on Europe's chemical industries, which will be expected to step up production of the substitutes needed for equipment such as freezers and industrial refrigerators.</p>
        <p>This will also mean that hundreds of makers of foam upholstery, fire extinguishers, insulation materials, solvents and many other items will have to move much faster to redesign their products. Allowing for some exceptions, such as medical products like asthma relievers, the ban will apply to chlorofluorocarbons and other chlorine- and bromine-based chemicals, which are believed to be the main agents attacking the ozone.  The End of CFC's?</p>
        <p>If the European Community adopts an earlier ban on chlorofluorocarbons, which is likely, this would remove 30 percent of the world's production by 1995. The United States manufactures close to 25 percent. The remainder is made in other industrial countries, many of which have signed a treaty to ban the chemicals by 2000, and in developing nations, including China, India and former Soviet republics.</p>
        <p>But European officials say that if countries elsewhere continue to use the chemicals, the products will be barred from the European Community.</p>
        <p>Scientists, both European and American, have been reluctant to predict whether the ozone depletion around the North Pole will be as dramatic as that found over the last five years around Antarctica.</p>
        <p>French and British researchers who worked in a team based in Kiruna, Sweden, say that new factors have recently appeared that may affect the less stable conditions around the North Pole conditions.  Good Cyclone, Bad Volcano</p>
        <p>An anticyclone last month may alleviate the situation by bringing in extra ozone from other regions. However, some scientists say that harmful chemical reactions could be speeded up by the vast clouds of sulfurous droplets left in the stratosphere after last year's volcanic eruptions in the Philippines.</p>
        <p>But American and European researchers all agreed that they had found exceptionally high levels of chlorine monoxide, which destroys ozone, and that this could lead to significant ozone loss as early as this spring. They warned that the chemicals have long life spans so that even if damage does not appear immediately, all the ingredients are there for this to happen in the next few years.</p>
        <p>The European Community is expected to approve more funds for the 250 scientists working from various northern airbases, including Siberia for the first time. The European group is working with United States teams led by NASA scientists, who have the use of a new American satellite and special research aircraft.  Changing Formulas Fast</p>
        <p>Since the new threats to the Earth's support system were disclosed, European environmentalists have increased their pressure on industrial giants like ICI, Hoechst, Akzo and Du Pont, demanding that they immediately halt their production of chlorofluorocarbons. The companies say they have been scaling down output rapidly, but they argue that not enough alternatives are available.</p>
        <p>"We get calls saying, why don't you stop making C.F.C.'s right now," said Nick Sommers, a spokesman for Akzo, the Dutch chemical company. "We say we will, but we have a certain responsibility to deliver until society makes the switch-over. Take heavy-duty refrigerators in meat and other markets: 40 percent of the world's food would spoil if it was not refrigerated."</p>
        <p>Industrialists seem divided whether the earlier deadlines are realistic. Some note that chlorofluorocarbons have already been practically phased out from use in aerosols. Producers of plastic foam are switching to other gases, as are other manufacturers. But ICI of Britain says there are only enough replacements for refrigeration gases to meet 5 percent of Europe's demand.  Ask About Safety and Cost</p>
        <p>Germany's Environment Minister, Klaus Toepfer, said manufacturers have told him they are adapting so quickly that they might give up C.F.C.'s ahead of schedule. Others argue that too much of a rush may be good politics but not safe chemistry.</p>
        <p>"Most companies have not finished toxicity and safety testing of the replacement products," said Mr. Sommers at Akzo. "We are almost putting the cart before the horse."</p>
        <p>But policymakers in various North European capitals want to move ahead on the premise that deadlines are useful catalysts.</p>
        <p>One senior official in Paris recalled that just five years ago, when the need for bans was first discussed, chemical makers balked and argued that substitutes were not available and that any change would cost billions and would put companies out of business.</p>
        <p>"That attitude has changed dramatically," said the official. "And experience has shown that it's better for governments to crank up the pressure. Then companies will find a way to invent new products or solve problems. Some always do."</p>
