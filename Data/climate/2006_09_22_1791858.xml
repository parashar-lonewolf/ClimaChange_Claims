        <p>PRESSURE ON CHIEF OF H.P. Pressure is mounting on Mark V. Hurd, Hewlett-Packard's chief executive, to explain what appears to have been his greater role in the company's spying operation than was initially indicated. Yesterday, after his name figured in documents newly surfacing in the investigation, Hewlett-Packard's stock fell significantly for the first time since the revelations began early this month, closing down 5.19 percent. [C1.]</p>
        <p>BILLIONS TO FIGHT GLOBAL WARMING -- Sir Richard Branson, the British magnate, said that his personal profits from airlines and a rail company that he controls -- a sum he estimated at $3 billion over the next 10 years -- would be invested in developing energy sources that do not contribute to global warming. [C1.]</p>
        <p>LIKE MEDICARE, BUT PRIVATE -- A type of private insurance plan is gaining ground that looks little different from the basic coverage long available to anyone with a federally issued Medicare card. [C1.]</p>
        <p>MIGRANTS MISSING FROM FARMS -- Stepped-up border enforcement kept many illegal Mexican migrant workers out of California this year, farmers and labor contractors said, putting strains on the state's shrinking seasonal farm labor force. [A1.]</p>
        <p>SPINACH GROWERS SWITCH TACTICS -- Amid growing governmental pressure and public concern about an E. coli outbreak caused by contaminated spinach, California farmers promised new procedures for growing, handling and shipping their produce, in hopes of lifting a week-old government warning about the crop. [A15.]</p>
        <p>SHARES FALL ON FEAR OF SLOWDOWN -- Stocks fell after a report said factory activity shrank in the Mid-Atlantic region in September for the first time in over three years, prompting worries about a slowdown in the economy and corporate profits. [C8.]</p>
        <p>INQUIRY ON HEART IMPLANTS -- Ela Medical, a small producer of implantable heart devices, said it had received a subpoena from federal health care fraud officials seeking information about possible inducements paid by the company to doctors using its products. [C4.]</p>
        <p>RULES FOR MILITARY LIFE INSURANCE -- Congress has taken final action to approve a bill to tighten rules governing the marketing of life insurance and high-cost mutual funds to American military personnel. [C4.]</p>
        <p>DROPPING OIL ROYALTIES -- A top official at the Interior Department said that she would not try to recover $1.3 billion in royalties that the government has lost as a result of flawed oil and gas leases it signed in the late 1990's. [C2.]</p>
        <p>MORE DELAYS FOR A380 -- The European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, the parent company of Airbus, confirmed that its troubled A380 would face still more delivery delay. [C7.]</p>
        <p>TRIBUNE MAY SELL SOME ASSETS -- The Tribune Company will consider selling some or all of its assets, which include 11 newspapers, 25 television stations and the Chicago Cubs, as a result of an agreement it worked out with its largest shareholder, the Chandler family. Dennis FitzSimons, above, the company's chief, said the agreement had ''eliminated impediments to any transactions we might want to do, and management will explore strategic alternatives.'' [C5.]</p>
        <p>MERCK OF GERMANY IN DEAL -- Merck of Germany said it would take control of Serono, a Swiss pharmaceutical maker, for $13.5 billion after failing to secure a merger with Schering, its German competitor. [C7.]</p>
        <p>NEXT STEP FOR GOOGLE ADS -- Google is turning to Madison Avenue to help persuade marketers that it can do more than display text. Advertising: Stuart Elliott. [C8.]</p>
