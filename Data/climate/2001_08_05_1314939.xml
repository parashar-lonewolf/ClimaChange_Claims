        <p>Editorial on Al Gore's return to public eye says that while he has right to re-enter presidential sweepstakes, he is also sorely needed as Democratic voice on behalf of issues he championed in 2000 election</p>

        <p>Al Gore is coming back. We should have expected him. Bill Clinton came back last week, at a giddy welcoming party from the neighbors of his new Harlem office.

        <p>Al Gore is coming back. We should have expected him. Bill Clinton came back last week, at a giddy welcoming party from the neighbors of his new Harlem office. The former president was looking so charismatic that it seemed it would be only a matter of time before Mr. Gore would pop up, too, so we could make unfavorable comparisons of his people skills.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Gore has been vacationing in Spain, growing a beard and working on a book with his wife, he has also been laying the groundwork for his re-emergence into public life. Later this month, he'll run some training sessions in Tennessee for young political activists. He intends to campaign for Democratic candidates this fall, and to start a new political action committee to help Congressional candidates in 2002. All this has naturally led to speculation that Mr. Gore is preparing to run again for president.</p>
        <p>A lot has happened since the former vice president withdrew from public activity after George W. Bush's inauguration. Congress passed the tax-cut plan that Mr. Gore had denounced during the campaign. Mr. Bush shelved the international treaty on global warming that Mr. Gore had done so much to nurture. Last week, the House approved an energy bill that gave environmentalists the shivers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has always been one of his party's smartest and most articulate leaders -- on foreign affairs, communications issues and finance, as well as the environment. But he kept his reactions to himself, saying he wanted to refrain from criticizing the new president so America would have time to recover from the trauma of the Florida recount. Meanwhile, Mr. Bush and his allies used that time to  promote programs that may have an effect on the country long after Florida has become a historical footnote.</p>
        <p>Some Democrats were furious at the silence from the top. Others are still so angry about the loss of the White House that they don't have room for additional ire. It is probably fair to say that a sizable chunk of his party would be perfectly happy if Mr. Gore stayed out of sight indefinitely. He is, after all, the man who wrested defeat out of the longest economic boom in American history, the champion debater who managed to go 1 for 3 against George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's fans point out that Richard Nixon rebuilt his political career after narrowly losing a race he should have won against John F. Kennedy. (It is a measure of Mr. Gore's luck that even his friends wind up comparing him to people like Mr. Nixon. And that 500,000-vote winning margin in the popular vote will mean a lifetime of being lumped with fellow Electoral College victims Samuel Tilden and Grover Cleveland.)</p>
        <p>Obviously, Mr. Gore has a right to leap back into the presidential sweepstakes and take his chances. The number of invitations he gets to campaign for Democratic candidates in high-profile races over the next year will be one indication of how good his standing in the party is, and his success or failure as a drawing card may indicate something about the public's sentiments. It could be a tough comeback. There are plenty of other people, including virtually every Democrat in the Senate, who think they could have run a better race last year and are ready to try to prove it.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore is sorely needed as a voice on behalf of the issues he championed in 2000. The Democrats have missed having a leader in the national debate over the Bush policies, particularly in foreign affairs and the environment. And if Mr. Gore decides to opt for being a sort of elder statesman rather than a presidential hopeful, he will never have to hear another critique of his wardrobe.</p>
