        <p>When peppy grooves compete with bummed-out lyrics, the grooves easily have the advantage; rhythm registers long before language does. At the Bogmen's sold-out concert on Friday night at Irving Plaza, the audience was too busy dancing, jumping up and down and crowd-surfing to think twice about what Bill Campion was singing. Songs from the Bogmen's album, "Life Begins at 40 Million"  (Arista), mourned a mother's death, imagined global warming, faced a manipulative psychiatrist, attacked a self-righteous hypocrite and confronted a  girlfriend who walked out when the singer lost his job. "You've got nothing nice to say, so spit it all out," Mr. Campion proclaimed.</p>
        <p>His voice could sound frazzled and exasperated; it also rose to mock-heroic,  high-vibrato choruses. Onstage he was exuberantly disheveled; at one point, he twirled around, then toppled. But as he bounded around, his energy came through  more clearly than his sarcasm.</p>

        <p>When peppy grooves compete with bummed-out lyrics, the grooves easily have the advantage; rhythm registers long before language does. At the Bogmen's sold-out concert on Friday night at Irving Plaza, the audience was too busy dancing, jumping up and down and crowd-surfing to think twice about what Bill Campion was singing. Songs from the Bogmen's album, "Life Begins at 40 Million"  (Arista), mourned a mother's death, imagined global warming, faced a manipulative psychiatrist, attacked a self-righteous hypocrite and confronted a  girlfriend who walked out when the singer lost his job. "You've got nothing nice to say, so spit it all out," Mr. Campion proclaimed.</p>
        <p>His voice could sound frazzled and exasperated; it also rose to mock-heroic,  high-vibrato choruses. Onstage he was exuberantly disheveled; at one point, he twirled around, then toppled. But as he bounded around, his energy came through  more clearly than his sarcasm.</p>
        <p>The band transmuted spite into propulsion. The music was driven by Bill Ryan's guitar parts, which sometimes used standard rock and funk devices -- power chords, scrubbing funk rhythms, blaring marchlike melodies -- but also reached beyond them. "The Third Rail," about squelching a child's creativity, had a calmly leaping guitar line out of Zimbabwean rock. And with both a drummer, Clive Tucker, and a percussionist, C. J. O'Connor, the Bogmen drew on African and Caribbean cross-rhythms that sounded festive even when Mr. Campion was imagining himself as a post-cremation pile of ashes in "Light a Candle for Me." Contemplating death, the music insisted on life.</p>
        <p>The Dan Zanes Trio, which opened the concert, plays determinedly sparse, backward-looking rock. Mr. Zanes, who used to lead the Del-Fuegos, has stripped down mid-1960's blues and soul to bare-bones guitar riffs, terse keyboard chords and drumbeats that are usually played with brushes. In most of the songs, Mr. Zanes casts himself as a lovesick loser, begging, "Please, please don't go." A few songs, including one that could be about an AIDS test, created  genuine suspense with their austerity, as Mr. Zanes aimed for the directness of  classic soul songwriters. Others, however, were too obvious in their borrowings  from the likes of Creedence Clearwater Revival, Booker T. and the M.G.'s and Sonny and Cher.</p>
