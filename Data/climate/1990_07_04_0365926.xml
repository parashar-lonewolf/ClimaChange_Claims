        <p>LEAD: The chemicals that destroy the earth's fragile protective layer of ozone will be largely phased out by the year 2000 under an agreement reached at a 93-nation meeting in London last week. That's a costly but vital step in averting a significant threat to the global environment.</p>
        <p>The chemicals that destroy the earth's fragile protective layer of ozone will be largely phased out by the year 2000 under an agreement reached at a 93-nation meeting in London last week. That's a costly but vital step in averting a significant threat to the global environment.</p>
        <p>Ozone, a pollutant at ground level, is a natural constituent of the stratosphere. It absorbs a kind of ultraviolet light from the sun that would otherwise harm or destroy most forms of life. But the ozone layer is being destroyed by industrial chemicals known as chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's.</p>
        <p>At a meeting in 1987, the major industrial countries agreed to cut production of CFC's 50 percent by 1998. China and India refused to go along unless given financial aid. The ozone threat has since grown more serious. The hole in the layer that appears over the Antarctic each summer shows signs of emerging in the Arctic as well, threatening northern Europe. A NASA survey of ground and satellite data suggested the global ozone layer has thinned by 3 percent in the last 20 years, a faster rate of destruction than expected.</p>
        <p>These new data persuaded industrial countries, led by the European Community and the U.S., to phase out CFC's entirely by 2000. In London, the Indian and Chinese delegates said they would recommend that their Governments go along. Developing countries have until 2010 to end CFC use. Withdrawing earlier objections, the U.S. will now contribute up to $60 million to the $240 million fund to help developing countries switch from CFC's.</p>
        <p>The costs of phasing out CFC's will be heavy. Since the substitutes will be less efficient insulators and refrigerants, the U.S. may use 3 percent more electricity. But the case against CFC's is so compelling that almost all governments have now agreed to act in the common interest.</p>
