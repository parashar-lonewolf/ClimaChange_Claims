        <p>A new analysis has challenged the accuracy of a climate timeline showing that recent global warming is unmatched for a thousand years.</p>
        <p>That timeline, generated by stitching together hints of past temperatures embedded in tree rings, corals, ice layers and other sources, is one strut supporting the widely accepted view that the current warm spell is being caused mainly by accumulating heat-trapping smokestack and tailpipe emissions.</p>
        <p>The authors of the study, published in the current issue of the online journal ScienceExpress, said they did not dispute that a sharp warming was under way and that its pace could signal a human influence. But they said their test of the methods used to mesh recent temperature records with centuries-old evidence showed that past natural climate shifts were most likely sharply underestimated.</p>
        <p>Many climate scientists credited the new study with pointing out how much uncertainty still surrounds efforts to turn nature's spotty, unwritten temperature records into a climate chronology.</p>
        <p>An accompanying commentary in ScienceExpress, by Dr. Timothy J. Osborn and Dr. Keith R. Briffa, scientists at the University of East Anglia in Britain, said it implied that ''the extent to which recent warming can be viewed as 'unusual' would need to be reassessed.''</p>
        <p>But many experts stressed that the new analysis did not undercut confidence that humans were the main cause of warming now -- a conclusion based on a host of evidence trails, including ocean warming and accelerating melting of glaciers.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Dr. Briffa and Dr. Osborn wrote that if past climate swings were bigger than they appeared, this could mean the earth's climate system might be more sensitive to external influences like shifts in the sun's output or the concentration of greenhouse gases than scientists had estimated. They said that might mean that future warming from human activities could be greater than had so far been projected.</p>
        <p>The lead author of the new study, Dr. Hans von Storch of Germany's GKSS research center, disagreed, saying his conclusion was simply that the old method of integrating climate clues from beyond a century ago was flawed.</p>
        <p>The significance of the new analysis comes partly because the record it challenges is a central icon in the debate over whether heat-trapping emissions should be curbed. The hallmark of the original method is a graph widely called the ''hockey stick'' because of its shape: a long, relatively unwavering line crossing the last millennium and then a sharp, upward-turning ''blade'' of warming over the last century.</p>
        <p>The new study essentially says the shaft of the stick could well be profoundly warped and the old statistical method would not notice.</p>
        <p>The original climate reconstruction emerged in the late 1990's as scientists took scattered indirect hints of past conditions, like variations in tree rings, and built an overall estimate. The researchers then merged the record of past centuries with the much more precisely captured climate history of the last 100 years. They used statistical formulas to account for the greater uncertainty in the older records and showed this in the resulting curve by including broadening gray zones on both sides of the graph's center line.</p>
        <p>To test this method, the new study undertook a climate deconstruction instead of a reconstruction. The researchers used two different computer simulations of global climate to create alternate thousand-year climate histories -- essentially global maps showing temperature trends on a greatly simplified planet.</p>
        <p>Working backward, they created temperature archives for particular places, each representing one of the real tree-ring or coral records. They then used the same methods that had generated the hockey stick curve and tried to regenerate the computer-generated climate records.</p>
        <p>In each case, Dr. von Storch said, the method nicely reproduced the last 100 years but sharply underestimated big century-long warm and cool spikes further back in time.</p>
        <p>Several authors of the existing climate history said they had always acknowledged the unavoidable uncertainties. They also questioned some techniques used in the new analysis. Dr. Michael E. Mann, a climate expert at the University of Virginia and the lead author of the studies that generated the hockey stick, said, for example, that the virtual climate created by Dr. von Storch's team had far greater past variations in the sun's output than what experts feel really happened.</p>
        <p>But many climate sleuths acknowledged that while the broad climate trends were clear, much remained uncertain.</p>
        <p>''I don't think anyone in the field would doubt we may be underestimating'' some past climate shifts, said Dr. Raymond S. Bradley, a University of Massachusetts climate expert and co-author of Dr. Mann's. ''For the general point von Storch is making,'' he added, ''fair enough.''</p>
