        <p>ENDING months of negotiations, National Grid and KeySpan have reached an agreement in principle with the Long Island Power Authority for operating its electric transmission and delivery systems for the next seven years.</p>
        <p>The agreement puts LIPA squarely behind the merger of National Grid and KeySpan. It also assures National Grid that it will hold lucrative management and service contracts with LIPA.</p>
        <p>The terms provide that National Grid, an energy company based in Britain with about 3.4 million customers in the Northeast United States, would pass on to LIPA $91 million in what were termed synergy savings that the merger would produce. The agreement amends and extends a 2005 agreement with KeySpan.</p>
        <p>National Grid also agreed to spend $100 million for environmental and efficiency upgrades at KeySpan's Northport and Port Jefferson power stations and $12 million for a joint energy efficiency program with LIPA for electric and gas customers.</p>
        <p>LIPA would hold on to an option to buy KeySpan's E. F. Barrett and Far Rockaway power plants -- both discussed as candidates for repowering, or retrofitting to reduce emissions and increase efficiency -- and would get options to buy two smaller units on property surrounding the defunct Shoreham nuclear plant.</p>
        <p>Unions for KeySpan's Long Island employees were assured that the merger would not result in layoffs.</p>
        <p>Richard M. Kessel, LIPA's chief executive, said the agreement increased to $236 million the benefits and services LIPA customers would realize from the merger.</p>
        <p>Kevin Law, who was recently appointed to succeed Mr. Kessel as the LIPA chairman, also endorsed the agreement. ''We think it will ultimately be beneficial to Long Islanders because of the resources that National Grid will bring to our operations down here,'' he said at a March 23 news conference announcing the agreement.</p>
        <p>The agreement needs approval from the LIPA board, the state comptroller and the attorney general.</p>
        <p>The merger, in which National Grid would pay $7.3 billion to buy KeySpan, is scheduled for completion this summer but is subject to approval by the New York Public Service Commission, which has questioned its benefits for customers. Regulators in New Hampshire, which would be served by National Grid, must also consent.</p>
        <p>Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, who has said the merger would shortchange Long Island electric customers, said in a statement that he ''remained skeptical.''</p>
        <p>Gordian Raacke, the executive director of Renewable Energy Long Island, a nonprofit group in Bridgehampton, said the $100 million upgrade of the Northport and Port Jefferson power stations fell short of what was needed. He said a better approach would be the more costly process of repowering the plants.</p>
        <p>Matthew C. Cordaro, the director of the Center for Management Analysis at the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University, said the agreement appeared to be ''a repackaging of what was already on the table to make it look like LIPA is gaining some more concessions.''</p>
