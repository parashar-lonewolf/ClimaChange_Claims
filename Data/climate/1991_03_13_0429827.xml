        <p>The fur trade, as it has for the last 350 years, will continue to play a vital role in the economic growth of Canada ("Fur Industry Shrinking With No End in Sight," Business Day, Feb. 26). Nearly 100,000 Canadians continue to derive their livelihood from trapping, fur farming and fur manufacturing. The only threat posed by animal activists is to the freedom of Canadians' choice to wear natural products such as leather and fur.</p>
        <p>The number of fur coats sold in this country has increased by 50 percent between 1983 and 1990. A recent independent study showed that one in four Canadian women now owns a fur coat or jacket, much higher than previous ownership figures.</p>

        <p>The fur trade, as it has for the last 350 years, will continue to play a vital role in the economic growth of Canada ("Fur Industry Shrinking With No End in Sight," Business Day, Feb. 26). Nearly 100,000 Canadians continue to derive their livelihood from trapping, fur farming and fur manufacturing. The only threat posed by animal activists is to the freedom of Canadians' choice to wear natural products such as leather and fur.</p>
        <p>The number of fur coats sold in this country has increased by 50 percent between 1983 and 1990. A recent independent study showed that one in four Canadian women now owns a fur coat or jacket, much higher than previous ownership figures.</p>
        <p>Because of an oversupply of farmed furs, the price of raw pelts has decreased in recent years, resulting in attractive prices for fur coats. However, this decline is at an end, as evidenced by the February raw fur auction, where mink prices increased by 40 percent over last year.</p>
        <p>For the foreseeable future, a huge proportion of humankind will go on eating fish, poultry and meat; it will continue to wear leather shoes and belts, and protect itself from the elements with clothing made of leathers and furs. Sometimes those shoes and belts, those jackets and coats, are styled to enhance appearance, as well as to keep feet dry and bodies warm.</p>
        <p>The fur industry is and must be a conservation industry. Without healthy forests and clean water there would be no industry. The relationship between the health of Canada's wildlife habitat and the fur industry is this direct, and this simple: if we pollute and destroy that habitat, we will destroy the livelihood of tens of thousands of Canadians.</p>
        <p>The future for the fur trade in Canada is very bright. With the increased concern over the environment, Canadians are choosing to buy environmentally friendly products.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists suggest that we should wear natural fibers to reduce the chemical depletion of the ozone and increases in the greenhouse effect created from nonrenewable petrochemicals in the manufacture of synthetics. Furs, like cotton, wool, linen, silk and leathers, are natural fabrics. DAVID SEBBEN Marketing Director, Ontario Office Fur Council of Canada Toronto, Feb. 28, 1991</p>
