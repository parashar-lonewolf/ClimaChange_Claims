        <p>The Environmental Protection Agency's new administrator, Christie Whitman, had no trouble connecting with her audience at a recent meeting of the Business Roundtable, a group of corporate executives, as she promised that the agency's history of ''banging heads'' was a thing of the past.</p>
        <p>And her bluntly antiregulatory message undercut the notion that Mrs. Whitman was at least a moderately gung-ho green who had been hung out to dry by her president.</p>
        <p>That impression had taken hold after President Bush, responding to pressures from the energy industry, broke a campaign pledge to put a cap on power plants' emissions of carbon dioxide, right after she had talked up his intention to control that greenhouse gas. Then, after she urged him ''to appear engaged'' on controlling global warming, the administration decided instead to write the obituary of the Kyoto Protocol, the international treaty on climate change.</p>
        <p>Even some environmental advocates were starting to pity Mrs. Whitman's supposed isolation.</p>
        <p>''It's been a pretty rough ride,'' said Greg Wetstone of the Natural Resources Defense Council. ''She's probably suffered one of the most immediate and embarrassing eviscerations of a new cabinet secretary ever.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wetstone said he had been willing to re-evaluate the Bush administration if it regulated carbon dioxide, ''which is amazing because I'm a little cynical from doing this for a long time.''</p>
        <p>''I felt like such a fool,'' Mr. Wetstone said.</p>
        <p>Like other environmentalists, he  seemed to assume that Mrs. Whitman felt the fool, too. But in a recent interview in her office, she argued that she had felt nothing at all after learning of the president's reversal.</p>
        <p>''It had nothing to do with me personally,'' she said. Conceding that she ''had been in a different place'' at first, she said she had come to accept the president's view that such regulation would be too costly to the economy and to consumers.</p>
        <p>''He was right, all things considered,'' Mrs. Whitman said. ''We're in an energy crisis, no two ways about it.''</p>
        <p>She never considered resigning, she said.</p>
        <p>''New Jersey was good training; we've got a lot of cranky people,'' she said. ''I just decided to do the best I could on the facts and stay away from reading the columnists.''</p>
        <p>Yet she would leave, she said, if she ever truly felt ''out of sync'' with the president; ''that hasn't happened yet,'' she said firmly.</p>
        <p>Allies in New Jersey say she differs with the president less on policy than on the politics of decisions that have been viewed as unfriendly to the environment. And friends suggest that Mrs. Whitman is in general far less liberal than her reputation, earned mainly on the basis of her support for abortion rights.</p>
        <p>''She's done some very socially conservative things; her record is not liberal,'' said her best friend, Nancy Risque Rohrbach, director of the National Museum of Women in the Arts, who has known Mrs. Whitman, 54, since their first year out of college, when they were both working for the Republican National Committee. ''She defies labels.''</p>
        <p>Environmentalists in New Jersey would agree; groups pushing for more environmental regulation generally considered her ''good on the green, bad on the brown,'' because she expanded the state's open space, but cut enforcement of air and water quality standards, abolished an environmental prosecutor's office and eased reporting rules for companies that handle toxic materials.</p>
        <p>In the interview, she defended a proposed 6.4 percent cut in the Environmental Protection Agency's budget, though environmentalists say it will probably mean layoffs among those responsible for enforcing environmental standards. ''We haven't been cut,'' she said. Only superfluous congressionally mandated programs were being trimmed, she said.</p>
        <p>At the meeting of the Business Roundtable, a closed event that a reporter seemed to have been invited to by accident and then was asked to leave before a question-and-answer period began, Mrs. Whitman seemed completely comfortable echoing Mr. Bush's pro-business philosophy.</p>
        <p>She opened her chummy talk this way: ''I hope you all had a successful day today and did the appropriate lobbying with the right senators.''</p>
        <p>''When the president says he wants to look at government as a partnership'' with private enterprise, ''he really means it,'' she told the executives, though it is hard to imagine who among them might have remained unconvinced of his sincerity on this point.</p>
        <p>She sounded thoroughly opposed to regulation when she said, ''While it's true that mandatory controls may have been necessary in the beginning, attitudes have changed, and we recognize that at the E.P.A.''</p>
        <p>Of her decision to review the Clinton administration's regulations cutting the amount of naturally occurring arsenic that would be allowed in municipal drinking water, she said she ''did that with no pressure from the White House, no pressure from interest groups.'' The Clinton rule, which environmentalists say is necessary to protect the public's health, was opposed by the mining industry and some municipalities, which argued that its costs were prohibitive.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman has said elsewhere that once the administration studies the matter, it may well adopt a more stringent arsenic standard than the one adopted under Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>But at the Business Roundtable, she said explicitly that she was concerned about how cutting arsenic levels might affect business: ''The impact is enormous on small and mid-sized water companies. We are going to take another look and see what it is we have to do to avoid unintended consequences.''</p>
        <p>Environmentalists are increasingly disillusioned. As Dan Weiss, former political director of the Sierra Club, put it: ''Another day, another environmental standard wrecked. This is worse than under Reagan.''</p>
        <p>Paul Begala, a former Clinton aide who worked for Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey in his losing campaign against Mrs. Whitman in 1993, said he had not been surprised by decisions. ''She always struck me as the consummate country club politician,'' Mr. Begala said. ''I never had a sense she had any passion except for tax cuts, so I guess she fits right in with this administration. It's, 'Let them drink Perrier.' ''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Rohrbach suggested that the former governor was not only tough enough but also ambitious enough to handle the criticism.</p>
        <p>''Long ago, when we were young, she knew she wanted to be governor,'' Ms. Rohrbach said.</p>
        <p>Though she is naturally reserved, it was Christie Todd who asked her future husband, John Whitman, out on their first date, because she needed an escort to the Nixon inauguration. Mr. Whitman's grandfather, Charles S. Whitman, became governor of New York in 1915. And both John and Christie were so sure of her political future that Mr. Whitman's drive to succeed in business was in part fueled by a desire to ''put the kids through school and still be able to fill in for Christie when she ran for office,'' Ms. Rohrbach said.</p>
        <p>In the interview, where Mrs. Whitman was crisp and correct, keeping on her wool jacket after noting that it was 89 degrees outside, the worst part of her job now, she said, was actually ''being away from my husband after 27 years.'' Mr. Whitman is a financial consultant in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Asked to characterize her tenure so far, she had to laugh. ''A roller coaster, shall we say?''</p>
        <p>In nearly every talk she gives, Mrs. Whitman says she grew up caring for the environment because she was reared on a farm -- an extremely lovely farm, in Oldwick, N.J. Her father, Webster B. Todd, was a wealthy Republican state chairman and her mother, Eleanor Schley Todd, was vice chairwoman of the Republican National Committee.</p>
        <p>Though it is unclear where Mrs. Whitman expects to go next, for now she seems determined to stick around and figure something out.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, she is asking environmental advocates to wait and see what proposals this administration may yet come up with before judging it, and her, too harshly. ''He desperately wants to be proactive,'' she said of the president. ''He hates being on the defensive.''</p>
        <p>As, of course, does Mrs. Whitman. For the record, she is not accepting condolences for her career just yet. ''If one more person says, 'You have the toughest job in the cabinet, . . .' '' she says, near the end of an hour-long interview. And for the first time, she showed real exasperation.</p>
