        <p>Encased in a massive black Toyota Land Cruiser, Shirley Collenette admits feeling a little guilty about her gas-guzzling, smog-inducing, planet-warming, road-hogging ''armor,'' as she calls her sport utility vehicle.</p>
        <p>But need is stronger than guilt.</p>
        <p>''The world is becoming a harder and more violent place to live, so we wrap ourselves with these big vehicles,'' said Ms. Collenette, a 46-year-old mother of two. ''It's like riding a horse. You have more power.''</p>
        <p>Like many other S.U.V. owners in Marin County, this corner of Northern California where wealth and liberal politics converge, Ms. Collenette has found herself stuck up the on ramp of a politically and culturally risky freeway. A fledgling anti-S.U.V. crusade has joined the list of trendy ''anti'' causes -- antismoking, antifur, antimeat -- and this has some members of the upper-middle class bristling in their bucket seats.</p>
        <p>Hostility seems to be everywhere, with attacks from all directions.</p>
        <p>Here comes the columnist Arianna Huffington and her nonprofit Detroit Project, with its soul-wrenching TV commercials linking S.U.V.'s to support of terrorism. The Evangelical Environmental Network, a coalition of Christian groups, declares Jesus ''lord over transportation choices'' and runs TV advertisements asking, ''What would Jesus drive?'' (Answer: not an S.U.V.)</p>
        <p>Earth on Empty, a group of Boston artists, plasters fake parking tickets on S.U.V. windshields that instruct drivers to ''try to get honest with yourself.'' The Earth Liberation Front claims to have set fire to S.U.V.'s recently at a dealership in Pennsylvania. The posters at a recent antiwar rally in San Francisco said ''Draft S.U.V. drivers first.''</p>
        <p>To the backlashers against the backlash, the Marin soccer moms with children, groceries and ski equipment for weekends in Tahoe, it can feel like a personal affront.</p>
        <p>''How else am I going to get four children from A to B?'' said Zoe Daffern, 41, of Kentfield. ''I don't think we're going to solve the world's problems by getting rid of S.U.V.'s.''</p>
        <p>She certainly is not getting rid of her black Chevy Suburban. ''It gives you a barrier, makes you feel less threatened,'' she said.</p>
        <p>For all their bulk, S.U.V.'s are not as safe as many owners imagine them to be, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has said it might propose new standards that would force substantial design changes. These include adding side curtain air bags, to reduce the risk in rollovers, and possibly lowering the profile of the biggest models, to cut the risk to cars hit by S.U.V.'s.</p>
        <p>And in response to tax laws that let businesses deduct $30,000 or more for supersized vehicles like the Hummer, Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, recently introduced a bill called the S.U.V. Business Tax Loophole Closure Act.</p>
        <p>Other gas-guzzling vehicles are out there, like pickup trucks, but none as popular and as profitable. One of every four new vehicles sold last year was an S.U.V., said Jeff Schuster, director of North American forecasting for J. D. Power and Associates. 3,977,864 in all. Even with the economy slumping, he said, that number is expected to rise to about 4.15 million this year.</p>
        <p>Government standards call for S.U.V.'s sold in the country to average 20.7 miles a gallon, while passenger cars must average 27.5 miles. The H2, the new Hummer model, weighs more than three tons and gets 11 miles to the gallon.</p>
        <p>Sarah Jain, an assistant professor of cultural anthropology at Stanford University, said that the S.U.V. -- a vehicle marketed for the independence it is supposed to provide even while posing serious social costs, like smog and rollovers -- embodies many incongruities in the culture.</p>
        <p>''It represents the inability of Americans to make a connection between consumption decisions and their social impact,'' she said. ''The war -- and the Huffington ads -- are giving voice to that frustration.''</p>
        <p>To Todd Gitlin, a professor of journalism and sociology at Columbia University, the biggest surprise about the S.U.V. backlash is that ''it took so long.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Huffington ''pressed a button that was ready to be detonated,'' he said, on a topic made acute by the threat of war. ''It is the transmutation of a big issue into a neighborhood issue. The S.U.V. is the place where foreign policy meets the road.''</p>
        <p>The Huffington commercials were financed by a $200,000 war chest. Critics have noted that the sponsors themselves have conspicuously consumed: Ms. Huffington, for instance, lives in a costly home in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles and owned a Lincoln Navigator S.U.V. before buying a Toyota Prius, a hybrid gas-and-electric subcompact.</p>
        <p>Csaba Csere, the editor of Car and Driver magazine, said the vilification of S.U.V.'s seemed somewhat arbitrary. The gas mileage of the pickup truck is just as horrendous as any S.U.V.'s, he said.</p>
        <p>''I don't see how commuting to work in a 5,000-pound pickup is any less sinful than a 5,000-pound S.U.V.,'' he added. ''I hope Arianna Huffington never gets into a limousine. It's a very fuel-inefficient vehicle.''</p>
        <p>The image of the S.U.V. taps into deep-seated yearnings in the American psyche, said Dr. Clotaire Rapaille, a medical and cultural anthropologist in Boca Raton, Fla.</p>
        <p>With their image of strength, power and size, the S.U.V. connects to ''reptilian'' instincts that are important for reproduction and survival, Dr. Rapaille said, ''disregarding the 'intellectual cortex' information that says rollovers are dangerous.''</p>
        <p>''My theory,'' he added, ''is the reptilian always wins.''</p>
        <p>The issue has made for dissimilar political bedfellows, Hollywood liberals and evangelical Christians. ''They might not be part of a religious organization, but many are concerned about transportation choices for spiritual reasons,'' said the Rev. Jim Ball, executive director of the Evangelical Environmental Network.</p>
        <p>''We've all seen the same evidence. First it was human health, global warming and oil dependence,'' Mr. Ball said. ''With the Middle East troubles, another cause has sprung up. It's a moral issue.''</p>
        <p>People who love or hate S.U.V.'s will probably not be affected by the advertisements, said Dan Becker, director of the Sierra Club's global warming and energy program.</p>
        <p>But ''the people in the middle, who may have bought an S.U.V. and are now saying 'Gee' are beginning to think,'' he said. ''Some of them will come to the right conclusion.''</p>
        <p>It is doubtful their ranks will include Kelly Kriston, 39, who was lusting over an orange Hummer H2 the other day in Marin County. It weighed 6,400 pounds and cost around $50,000.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Kriston considered buying it, did he feel guilt? ''Not one iota,'' he said. ''I like having all that metal around me. It's got that massive feel-good factor.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  February 11, 2003, Tuesday  An article on Saturday about the guilt voiced by some Californians about the fuel consumption of their sport utility vehicles gave an incorrect spelling in some copies for the surname of the editor of Car and Driver magazine, who said the vilification of S.U.V.'s seemed somewhat arbitrary. He is Csaba Csere, not Csera.</p>
