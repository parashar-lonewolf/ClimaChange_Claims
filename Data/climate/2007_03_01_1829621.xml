        <p>Harry Potter Passes a Test</p>
        <p>Harry Potter did the full monty in the West End, and the critics liked what they saw. In other words, Daniel Radcliffe, right, best known for his film portrayals of the boy wizard Harry Potter, received enthusiastic reviews when he opened at the Gielgud Theater in London on Tuesday in a revival of the 1973 Peter Shaffer psychological thriller, ''Equus,'' in which he plays a tortured teenager, a role that requires him to appear in the nude, Reuters reported. Excitement surrounding the West End stage debut of Mr. Radcliffe, 17, helped sell $3.9 million worth of tickets before the opening and attracted a galaxy of stars to the first night, including Bob Geldof, Helena Bonham Carter and Christian Slater. The play's co-star is Richard Griffiths (Harry's nasty uncle in the films), as the psychiatrist who plumbs the teenager's obsession with horses. ''No flash in the magic pan,'' was The Guardian's assessment of Mr. Radcliffe's performance. The Daily Telegraph said, ''Brilliant Radcliffe throws off Harry Potter's cloak.''</p>
        <p>Priceless Greek Icon Found</p>
        <p>Greek restorers have discovered a priceless 17th-century painting beneath the silver sheet covering a Byzantine icon of St. John the Baptist kept for years in a provincial church, Reuters reported. Concealed for centuries beneath the ornate cover, the icon, left, with miniature scenes from St. John's life, is dated 1646 and signed by Emmanuel Tzanes, a theologian, priest and leading artist of his time, whose works are in museums around the world. ''This is very important,'' Georgios A. Voulgarakis, the Greek culture minister, said yesterday. ''This icon is recorded for the first time under his name.'' Ministry officials said the painting must have been covered by the silver sheet around 1760, leaving only the faces visible to the faithful who kissed and prayed to it ever since, unaware of its value. St. John is shown against a gold background, while 12 scenes from his life, from conception to beheading and burial, line the sides and bottom of the icon. Mr. Voulgarakis said that after restoration, the icon would be returned to the church, in Kranidi, a town in the Peloponnese, where it would receive special security.</p>
        <p>Roundup: The Usual Suspects</p>
        <p>Paris Hilton, below, was cited by the police for driving on a suspended license after officers stopped her for speeding and driving without headlights late on Tuesday in Los Angeles, Reuters reported. They took away her 2007 blue Bentley Continental GTC. Five weeks ago she was sentenced to three years' probation after pleading no contest to alcohol-related reckless driving.  The rap star and business magnate Sean Combs, known as Diddy, below, has been accused of battery at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, across the street from the Kodak Theater, on the day of the Academy Awards, The Associated Press reported. His publicist declined immediate comment.  The former Phish frontman Trey Anastasio pleaded not guilty on Tuesday in Fort Edward, N.Y., to felony counts of illegally possessing prescription painkillers and driving while impaired. He is also charged with misdemeanors: possession of heroin and an anti-anxiety medication prescribed for someone else. Although he faces a maximum of 14 years in prison if convicted on all counts, all the charges carry minimum sentences involving no incarceration. His lawyer, Steve Coffey, said Mr. Anastasio, 42, had a drug problem and was seeking treatment. Mr. Anastasio agreed to a pre-plea investigation and is scheduled to return to court on March 27.  The country singer Troy Lee Gentry, 39, of the duo Montgomery Gentry, was required to give up hunting in Minnesota for five years after he was sentenced to three months' probation and a $15,000 fine on Friday for killing a 600-pound captive black bear named Cubby, The Associated Press reported. He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in November. Authorities said that Mr. Gentry videotaped and edited the bow-and-arrow hunt to make it appear that the bear died in a ''fair chase,'' when in fact it was sold for $4,650 by Lee Marvin Greenly, who orchestrated the hunt at the 80-acre Minnesota Wildlife Connection near Sandstone, Minn.</p>
        <p>92nd Street Y Programs Venture to TriBeCa</p>
        <p>The 92nd Street Y's Makor and Daytime programs are headed to TriBeCa from the West Side of Manhattan. The Y is to announce today that it has signed a lease with Trinity Real Estate for 15,000 square feet at 200 Hudson Street, at Canal Street, to house the programs beginning in the fall. Kostow Greenwood Architects will design the site. The West Side location, at 35 West 67th Street, donated to the Y in 2001 by the philanthropist Michael H. Steinhardt, was sold in September to the City University of New York, which plans to use it as the home of its Honors College. Makor's cultural programs serve young adults, particularly those on the margins of Jewish life; Daytime serves retired or semiretired baby boomers.</p>
        <p>Footnote</p>
        <p>''An Inconvenient Truth,'' the Academy Award-winning Davis Guggenheim documentary about Al Gore's quest to spur action against global warming, will have its premium cable premiere on Showtime on March 11 at 8 p.m. The broadcast will be followed by a further discussion of the subject by Mr. Gore.</p>
