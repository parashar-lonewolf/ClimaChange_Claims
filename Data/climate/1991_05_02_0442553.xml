        <p>In the 1930's, when Shenandoah National Park was established here in the Blue Ridge Mountains and engineers boldly stretched the Skyline Drive from one lofty end of the mountain range to the other, visitors could clamber up Mary's Rock and, on a clear day, make out the tip of the Washington Monument 65 miles to the east.</p>
        <p>These days, even on the crispest morning after a hard rain, the view from the rock seldom reaches halfway to the monument, and on most mornings little can be made out more than 15 miles away.</p>
        <p>Air pollution, most of it blown by winds that carry a high concentration of acids produced from factories and utility plants in the Midwest, is the worst in any national park in the country, according to the National Park Service.</p>
        <p>The pollution at Shenandoah National Park, which extends 80 miles along the crest of the Blue Ridge in northern Virginia, not only obscures the striking panoramas once visible from cliff-hugging overlooks, but is also slowly poisoning the park's trout streams and killing its ferns, flowers and forests.  On the 'Edge of Disaster'</p>
        <p>The Park Service considers the threat to Shenandoah and other parks so serious that it has recently become one of the Federal Government's most aggressive proponents of antipollution measures. It is opposing two new power plants in southern Virginia, and has suggested other remedies that could slow the pace of economic development in the country.</p>
        <p>"Shenandoah National Park is under siege more than any other park in the country," said J. William Wade, the superintendent of the park, where spring is now climbing the mountainsides at nature's rate of 100 feet a day, the buds bursting bright green, white, red and yellow despite the haze.</p>
        <p>"We've got fish and trees up here that are slowly but steadily beginning to weaken, and in a few cases die, and we've even had a couple of days up here when we've had to issue pollution health warnings," Mr. Wade said. "We're right on the edge of disaster, poised."</p>
        <p>"What we do to correct this problem could set a pattern," he continued. "But in any case we've got to act, and fast. More industrial sites and power plants are on the drawing boards, and that means more pollution will soon be on the way if we don't somehow head it off." Top-Ranked Park in Sulfates</p>
        <p>The Park Service says Shenandoah ranks first among major Federal parks in the amount of sulfates in its air, and second in the amount of ozone. Sulfates are a critical part of acid rain, which contains high concentrations of acid-forming chemicals produced in the burning of coal and other industrial processes and carried aloft by air currents. The acidic deposits kill aquatic life, and ozone damages the leaves and slows the growth of plants and trees.</p>
        <p>As a result of its concern for Shenandoah, the Park Service is opposing new industrial plants for the first time in its history.</p>
        <p>In findings that are disputed by state and Federal environmental agencies, the Park Service contends that the two new coal-fired electric power plants, proposed for southern Virginia would mean more air pollution in Shenandoah, even though the plants would be equipped with pollution control devices. It has said the construction permits should be denied until a way can be found to put a limit on the amount of pollution flowing into the park.</p>
        <p>One suggested solution: allow the new plants to be built if their owners agree to pay for devices to cut pollution from older plants elsewhere in the state. In other words, offset new pollution with a reduction in old pollution.</p>
        <p>The Park Service also plans to study new industrial sites and power plants planned near other parks, including Great Smoky Mountains National Park on the Tennessee-North Carolina line and Acadia National Park in Maine.</p>
        <p>The agency is also focusing on older plants that affect air quality in Federal parks, particularly Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona, where visibility is often a serious problem.</p>
        <p>"Parks are meant to be beautiful and heathful places, by definition," said Molly N. Ross, the Park Service's assistant chief of air quality. "We intend to protect ours. We will report what we find and what we think must be done. If that has a beneficial effect beyond our parks, so much the better."</p>
        <p>The Virginia Department of Air Pollution Control acknowledges that air pollution in Shenandoah is a serious problem. Nevertheless, it has approved construction of the new plants. The department says pollution estimates and wind calculations do not indicate that the plants, the first of a dozen or so planned for the rapidly growing state, would add to the park's problems.</p>
        <p>The regional office of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, the nation's final nonjudicial arbiter of air pollution cases, also says its calculations and estimates do not indicate that the new plants would cause further damage to the park.</p>
        <p>Environmental groups are expected to appeal these findings, and Park Service officials say they will continue to lobby against building the plants unless steps are taken to put a limit on the level of pollution in Virginia.</p>
        <p>"This case is much too serious to let such a flawed finding pass unchallenged," said David W. Carr Jr., a lawyer with the Southern Environmental Law Center, a nonprofit group based in Charlottesville, Va., that monitors environmental issues.</p>
        <p>"The future of a unique park is at stake, along with the environmental future of a lot of the rest of the state and, for that matter, the future of a lot of other parks," he said. "We'll challenge it, if necessary, if people don't back off and find a better solution. In fact, we'll take it into the courts if necessary." 'A Really Major Decision'</p>
        <p>Mr. Carr added: "Sooner or later the E.P.A. will be forced to pass judgment on a fellow Federal agency that has suggested a far-reaching solution to an air quality problem that could affect the pace of industrial growth in a state. That's a really major decision, a precedent, really, and you can bet it will go all the way to the White House before it's over."</p>
        <p>On April 18 the Law Center, along with 14 other leading environmental organizations, including the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Trout Unlimited, called the Virginia and E.P.A. findings inadequate and urged the Federal environmental agency to reassess problems that new power plants might cause in Shenandoah National Park and the rest of Virginia.</p>
        <p>While there is a dispute about how much the new power plants would add to Shenandoah's pollution problems, there is little dispute with longstanding statistics indicating that the park is already under serious assault from air pollution, with more than 90 percent of it coming from west of Virginia. Turning Water Into Vinegar</p>
        <p>Studies by the park's scientists and by scientists at the University of Virginia show that air pollutants, particularly the sulfur spewed from coal-fired power plants -- most of them in the industrial Midwest -- are getting into the Shenandoah's streams, mainly in the form of acid rain, raising the acid level in many of them to the point where some fish are dying. A year or so ago, after a particularly heavy assault of foul air, one stream was found to be almost as acidic as vinegar.</p>
        <p>Other studies have found that pollutants, especially ozone, are beginning to harm plants and forests, causing some to lose leaves and weakening the disease resistance of others. Twice in recent years, ozone levels have risen so high that park officials have been forced to issue health warnings to hikers, climbers and joggers.</p>
        <p>"A lot of national parks are heavily impacted by too many visitors, and some by encroaching development," said David Haskell, chief of the Division of Natural Resources and Science in Shenandoah. "We have some of that, too. But what we have more of than any other park is bad air. It's slowly but surely killing us. When you think about what parks are supposed to be, that's a terrible irony."</p>
