        <p>In an earlier life, Seville's port sent great galleons down the Guadalquivir  River and across the ocean to the Americas, carrying weapons, textiles, tools, bringing back silver, gold and hardwoods, all to this city's greater glory.</p>
        <p>The fine palaces and mansions here still testify to those prosperous times, but galleons sailing up the Guadalquivir these days would have trouble reaching  Seville.</p>
        <p>Five years of unrelenting drought in southern and central Spain, the worst of the century, have sapped water from the streams and rivers and drawn the life from this region's rich groves of orange and olive trees. Local trading companies say as much as half of the coming olive harvest may be lost; they are  still calculating the value of losses of cotton and wheat and of Seville's normally pulpy lemons and oranges.</p>
        <p>"Can you imagine, I have been watering my olive groves," said Francisco Iruegas, who has a farm on the city's outskirts. Now even that rare measure has  become impossible since the authorities forbade all irrigation.</p>
        <p>"All this is very painful," he said, not knowing what upset him most, losing  much of his olive crop or pulling up his desiccated peach and apricot trees.</p>
        <p>It was only natural, Mr. Iruegas said, that he recently joined 25,000 other farmers from the Guadalquivir basin in a protest through downtown Seville to the region's Water Board. With their tractors, they hauled stacks of dead fruit trees through the streets in a great and angry funeral march. There were broken  windows and smashed doors when farmers tried to push their shriveled trees into  the Water Board's offices.</p>
        <p>With some of Seville's reservoirs reduced to mud puddles, the drought has also worked its way into every home. The city now rations domestic water and cuts supplies during the night. The town hall has taken to recycling waste water to save the palm trees and the lush foliage of Seville's celebrated parks.</p>
        <p>"We certainly can't drink this," said Angeles Guerra, opening her kitchen faucet and filling a glass with what she called "a liquid that is brackish, dank and an insult to us all."</p>
        <p>No one can remember anything like it in Spain, the world's largest olive oil  producer, but in November, shopkeepers were hiding stocks of olive oil under the counter, reserving it for favorite customers. At the same time, the sale of water tanks was booming.</p>
        <p>Debates and arguments about who is to blame for the water shortages range far and wide. A favorite theory is that Spain is an early victim of global warming.  Others dispute this, noting that the history of southern Spain is rife with drought cycles.</p>
        <p>There are those who blame the central Government. For the last 12 years, as the south's groundwater reserves dwindled, the Madrid Government's national hydrological plan has been held up in disputes.</p>
        <p>The plan involves spending millions of dollars on building a network of reservoirs and canals to connect the well-watered and verdant north to the dry southern regions. But the plans to transfer their water have provoked angry street demonstrations by northerners opposed to subsidizing the "reckless" southerners.</p>
        <p>Amparo Rubiales, the federal Government's representative in Seville, said that water consumption had gone up with improved standards of living.</p>
        <p>"People now have bathrooms, they take showers," she said. "We're cleaner. Our hygiene has changed."</p>
        <p>Besides, she said, "water is too cheap here. Prices are among the lowest in Europe."</p>
        <p>"There's enough water in the north of Spain," she said. "But we have to reach a consensus or there will be a war between the regions."</p>
        <p>Rafael Casaleiz, an environmentalist who is among those who say the shortages contain a morality tale of people living beyond their means, mused on the foolhardiness of creating large tourist resorts in an almost chronically dry region. In summer, when shortages are worst, tourists almost triple the population in the sunbelt around Seville and on the nearby Costa del Sol. Hotels do not appeal for water saving for fear of inconveniencing their customers.</p>
        <p>Other misplaced imports are lawns and golf courses, he went on. "Softhearted, thirsty lawns are not part of the Mediterranean culture," he said, indignation rising in his voice. "This climate is for shrubs and pines and olive trees that  thrive on adversity."</p>
        <p>Juan Collado, a labor lawyer, was in town lobbying for Government emergency aid for some 120,000 day laborers. He said that they would find no seasonal jobs because of failed crops and that there might be more lean years to come. "Some fruit trees, like apricots, that were burned by the sun can take seven years to  recover," he said.</p>
        <p>One Sunday in November, the Archbishop of Seville convoked all the region's bishops at the pilgrimage site of El Rocio and in a High Mass they jointly prayed for rain. Rain came the same day.</p>
        <p>"It doesn't quite work like this," said Mr. Casaleiz, the environmentalist. "But they can't have done any harm."</p>
