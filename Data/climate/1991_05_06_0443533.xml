        <p>The White House, in offering enticements to win approval for trade legislation it sorely wants, has abandoned a position that has been held dear by the Bush Administration -- and earlier by the Reagan Administration. It has also revived a debate over whether the Government should give special help to workers who lose their jobs because of competition from imports.</p>
        <p>To win labor backing for trade expansion in the 1960's, the Kennedy Administration came up with a plan to provide payments and retraining benefits to workers hurt by imports. In recent years, the Reagan and Bush Administrations have tried to kill the program.</p>
        <p>But to court support for the authority to negotiate a Mexican trade pact, President Bush has agreed to consider benefits specifically related to labor problems that are likely to arise from trade expansion with Mexico. Through its about-face, the Administration hopes to undermine a powerful coalition of labor, textile, environmental and other interests, all of whom fear that an agreement with Mexico will cost jobs and hurt the environment because of looser Mexican standards. Evolved Over 3 Decades</p>
        <p>In a letter to Congress last Wednesday, Mr. Bush agreed, among other things, to consider "adequate assistance and effective retraining for dislocated workers."</p>
        <p>The pledge means the Administration will work with Congress to shape a new or improved package of worker services. It represents a shift in the longstanding position of both the Reagan and Bush Administrations that special import adjustment programs are unnecessary.</p>
        <p>Such assistance has evolved through several pieces of legislation over three decades. But some members of Congress and union officials say current assistance is not adequate to deal with the possible employment shocks that could result from a Mexican accord.</p>
        <p>The Administration has different expectations. Instead of shocks, it sees a net gain in the employment rolls, reflecting trade and economic growth spurred by the lowering of tariff walls.</p>
        <p>Yet even the Administration's studies acknowledge that Mexican imports could hurt certain sectors, like the fruit and vegetable industries of Florida, Texas and California and the glass and cement industries elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Perceptions of this vulnerability and the anxiety on Capitol Hill were behind the policy change announced on Wednesday, Administration officials said.</p>
        <p>"Obviously, we're hoping to work out an acceptable compromise with the Hill," one senior trade official said. Prefer Current System</p>
        <p>While Administration officials state their willingness to bargain on trade adjustment, they stress their preference for the system already in place under the 1988 Economic Dislocation and Worker Adjustment Assistance Act, which provides retraining services and needs-related payments to all laid-off workers, not just those forced out by imports.</p>
        <p>In its first three years, the act served some 700,000 workers in such industries as autos, timber, electronics, copper, food processing, aerospace, military and steel.</p>
        <p>But many Democratic members of Congress prefer the trade adjustment assistance concept originated by John F. Kennedy in 1962 and amended in 1974 in connection with another bid for trade expansion.</p>
        <p>The main differences are that the Kennedy approach relates specifically to job losses from imports and provides much larger entitlements. Workers certified as displaced by trade compeition get up to an additional 26 weeks of unemployment insurance.</p>
        <p>Critics say this is unfair, providing greater benefits to a worker who loses a job because of international competition than to one displaced by domestic competition. And with the globalization of the United States economy, it is often difficult to make the distinction between the domestic and international competitive forces that may be the cause.</p>
        <p>Yet another significant difference between the two programs is that services under the Kennedy approach are distributed at the Federal level, while economic dislocation services are delivered by the states and local bodies. Critics say the latter approach creates disparities in the distribution of benefits.</p>
        <p>Over the last three years, the Administration has unsuccessfully tried to terminate the trade adjustment assistance program.  Higher Appropriations</p>
        <p>But the Democratic-controlled Congress refuses to let it die. This year's appropriations for the trade adjustment program are $191 million, compared with $100 million in 1990. Appropriations for the economic dislocation program are $527 million, compared with $514 million in 1990.</p>
        <p>According to Labor Department statistics, the economic dislocation program costs $1,200 a worker, and its training programs succeed in placing 70 percent of those enrolled; trade adjustment costs $7,000 a worker and has a 35 percent placement rate.</p>
        <p>"Given the choice of the two, we opt for the one with the higher success rate," the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, said last week. New Aid From Congress</p>
        <p>Recent legislation suggests that Congress has taken an increased interest in stepping into situations in which workers are affected by Federal programs, a development that could strongly influence the trade adjustment debate, said Howard F. Rosen, a senior official in the Carter Administration's Labor Department who is now a research associate at the Institute for International Economics.</p>
        <p>Under the Clean Air Act and the Defense Department Reauthorization Bill, both enacted last year, Congress insisted on compensating workers hurt by its own legislation.</p>
        <p>Under the Clean Air legislation, Congress allocated an additional $50 million a year for the next five years to assist coal miners who might lose their jobs as a result of that law's proscriptions against acid rain. The Defense Department legislation similarly provides compensation for those who lose their jobs because of the closing of military bases.</p>
