        <p>To save money, airlines in the United States are circulating less fresh air into the cabins of many airplanes. As a result, flight attendants, as well as some passengers, have begun to complain that the practice is causing headaches, nausea and other health problems, especially after long flights.</p>
        <p>The reduction of fresh air is done only on newer planes. Older aircraft built before the mid-1980's provided cabins with 100 percent fresh air that was circulated every three minutes. But the newer models provide half fresh air and half recirculated air that is freshened every six or seven minutes or longer. The recirculation system enables the planes to use less fuel to cool the outside air, which is heated by the engines as it is drawn in.</p>

        <p>To save money, airlines in the United States are circulating less fresh air into the cabins of many airplanes. As a result, flight attendants, as well as some passengers, have begun to complain that the practice is causing headaches, nausea and other health problems, especially after long flights.</p>
        <p>The reduction of fresh air is done only on newer planes. Older aircraft built before the mid-1980's provided cabins with 100 percent fresh air that was circulated every three minutes. But the newer models provide half fresh air and half recirculated air that is freshened every six or seven minutes or longer. The recirculation system enables the planes to use less fuel to cool the outside air, which is heated by the engines as it is drawn in.</p>
        <p>"Ventilation systems are driven by air that comes off the engines," said Jack Gamble, the chief spokesman for Boeing, which uses recirculation systems on its newer planes. "If you cut back on the engine system, cut back on the speed, burn less fuel, you're going to cut back on the amount of air circulating in the cabin." Few Complaints Received</p>
        <p>Airline officials say they have received no significant increase in passenger complaints. They also say there is no conclusive correlation between cabin air and the health of passengers.</p>
        <p>But Doris Bachrach, a Manhattan securities analyst and frequent traveler, said that in the last two years she had experienced severe headaches on domestic flights of more than four hours. On a recent round trip from Kennedy International Airport to San Francisco aboard American Airlines, she said, "Both ways, I walked off with a headache, which in my case invariably turns into a migraine."</p>
        <p>Fidel Gonzalez, a flight attendant based in Chicago with United Airlines, said attendants are constantly complaining about the air quality in airplane cabins. "Some have been so sick they couldn't take the next flight," he said. A Growing Trend</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Dr. Jeffrey R. Davis, medical director of American Airlines, said that the oxygen supply in recirculated air was better "than you would get in an office building or crowded department store."</p>
        <p>About half the seats on the seven million domestic flights last year were on aircraft with the new systems, experts said. A Government study said that in 1985 about 30 percent of the flights were on planes with such systems and that by 1990 the proportion had grown to 40 percent. These newer planes, built for an era of fierce competition, include Boeing 757's and 767's and newer versions of 737's and 747's, as well as McDonnell Douglas MD80's and MD11's.</p>
        <p>"I think it's more desirable to have outside air, but it's a trade-off," said Dr. Andrew Horne, a medical officer with the Federal Aviation Administration's Office of Aviation Medicine. "If you want to spend more money for fuel, then you get more outside air."</p>
        <p>But airlines say that there is no significant problem. David Shipley, a spokesman for USAir said, "We have worked with the F.A.A. over the years to improve air cabin quality, and do not think we have any problems specific to USAir or the type of aircraft we fly." No Complaint Filed</p>
        <p>Joseph Hopkins, a spokesman for United Airlines, said that the number of formal complaints was a "statistically insignificant" percentage of last year's 430 million passengers. But Ms. Bachrach said she had never filed a formal complaint, nor do many other afflicted passengers. Neither the Federal Aviation Administration nor the Air Transport Association, which represents the major airlines, compiles data on passenger complaints concerning the quality of air in the cabins.</p>
        <p>Several Government studies have noted that proving a link between air circulation and health is difficult because there is no data on the health of passengers before they board a flight.</p>
        <p>But the studies say that less frequent circulation of fresh air exposes passengers not only to the respiratory problems of other passengers but also to higher levels of carbon dioxide, as well as to fumes from materials used to construct or maintain the cabins. These include cleaning agents, pesticides and gases like ethanol and benzene. Such exposure, the studies found, could cause headaches, malaise and fatigue.</p>
        <p>Because of extensive complaints from its members, the Association of Flight Attendants, the union representing attendants at United, USAir, Alaska Airlines and 18 smaller companies, commissioned an extensive investigation of the problem at its annual convention last November. The results are not yet in. Dispute About Air Flow</p>
        <p>"We have flight attendants with respiratory problems on all our airlines," said Chris Witkowski, the union's director of aviation safety. "If the airlines weren't so concerned about the bottom line and saving every penny, they could increase the air flow," he said.</p>
        <p>The airlines and aircraft manufacturers say, air is circulated for six or seven minutes or longer, before being freshened. The rate of circulation, which can be controlled by the pilot, varies by airline and type of aircraft, but it is also heavily influenced by the plane's speed. In an effort to save fuel and money, many longer flights have slowed to take greater advantage of jet stream winds, thereby reducing the air intake and slowing the circulation of air in the cabin.</p>
        <p>Some experts estimate that the rate of air circulation is much slower than the airlines and manufacturers say. One authority, Farrol S. Kahn, founder of the Aviation Health Institute in Oxford, England, says that airlines minimize the circulation, changing cabin air only every 12 minutes, which reduces the cost of cooling it.</p>
        <p>Pilots have been not been affected by the changes in air circulation, because cockpits have a separate ventilation system and the air is circulated more frequently to keep electronic equipment cool. Studies Show Problems</p>
        <p>A study by the National Research Council, a unit of the National Academy of Sciences, found in 1985 that many chemicals used in constructing, maintaining or cleaning airplanes are quite toxic. A Department of Transportation study in 1989 found that carbon monoxide aboard a plane could cause acute respiratory harm.</p>
        <p>Studies have also found that passengers with respiratory problems can infect their fellow passengers unless enough outside air is supplied to dilute the contagious effects of coughs and sneezes.</p>
        <p>"Reducing the amount of fresh air from outside the cabin and increasing the length of time between cleaning of the vent system increases the amount of contamination in the air that passengers and flight attendants breathe," said Mr. Witkowski of the flight attendants union.</p>
        <p>Several Government studies have shown relatively high levels of carbon dioxide in airplane cabins. At the request of flight attendants, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health studied MD80's used by Alaska Airlines last February. The agency found that carbon dioxide averaged 4,882 parts per million, more than four times the 1,000 p.p.m maximum set by the American Society of Heating Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers. Study Is Inconclusive</p>
        <p>But the study found that the data did not support the claim that carbon dioxide exposure was responsible for complaints of lightheadedness, dizziness, headaches, and nausea. "The cause of most of the incidents remains undetermined," the study said.</p>
        <p>Flight attendants have complained of many health problems on the airline's MD80's. Gail Bigelow, the union president at Alaska Airlines, said, "We have hundreds of flight attendants who have become ill aboard the MD80's due to air quality."</p>
        <p>After the study, the Federal agency recommended that Alaska Airlines increase cabin ventilation before takeoffs and after landings and urged a review of products used in or around the aircraft.</p>
        <p>Louis Cancelmi, a spokesman for Alaska Airlines, said the report exonerated his company. But Meg Leith, an union official, said the study was "inconclusive" and was based only on limited testing.</p>
