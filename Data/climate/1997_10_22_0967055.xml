        <p>An American team in Bonn is deep in negotiations that, it is hoped, will lead to the signing of an international treaty on global warming in Kyoto, Japan, in December. Such a treaty would define the responsibilities of roughly 170 nations for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. President Clinton, who is scheduled to outline his policy on global warming today, must walk a fine line, balancing the concerns of environmentalists who worry about the fate of the earth and those of business and labor constituencies who worry about the fate of their companies and jobs.</p>
        <p>But on what basis should the President strike that balance? The typical economic approach to such problems is cost-benefit analysis. But there is a big problem with applying that tool here. While we have some ability to quantify the costs of policies intended to retard global warming, we have little basis for estimating the benefits. The scientific consensus takes us only so far. Yes, global warming is for real. Yes, burning fossil fuels seems to be a significant cause. And yes, most potential climatic consequences are worrisome -- and some are truly horrifying. But scientists cannot tell us how the earth's climate will change if nothing is done.</p>
        <p>So I suggest a different approach: Instead of weighing costs against benefits, it makes more sense to look at action against global warming as taking out an insurance policy. This is what homeowners do, spending hundreds of dollars every year to insure their families against the unknown, though presumably small probability that their house will burn down. Shouldn't the family of man do the same for its home?</p>
        <p>As we shop for this global insurance policy, we should seek the most economical one. We can drastically reduce its cost by applying four basic economic principles:</p>
        <p>* Market-based approaches work more efficiently than clumsy command-and-control techniques. The leading candidate in this case seems to be distributing or auctioning permits to emit, say, carbon dioxide, and then allowing free-market trading to establish their price. By now we have enough experience with emissions trading to predict that it will reduce pollution at a fraction of the cost of regulation. The President is expected to emphasize these kinds of incentives to reach his goals. It is time that the rest of the world got on board.</p>
        <p>* Global problems require global perspectives and responses. It makes sense to reduce carbon emissions where that can be done most cheaply. We should therefore explore innovations like global emissions trading and allowing American companies to ''buy'' emissions reduction in other countries, although both are fraught with practical difficulties. It is important that all countries get involved. We cannot hold developing nations to the same standards as developed ones, but their eventual participation is essential.</p>
        <p>* Haste makes waste. It's cheaper to engineer new products for energy efficiency than it is to retrofit old ones. That means we can greatly lower the costs of reducing carbon emissions if we allow our existing transportation fleet, factories, home heating systems and especially power-generating plants to wear out rather than scrapping them. We can afford such patience because it is the accumulated concentration of greenhouse gases that affects global temperatures, not the annual output of emissions. For these reasons, the much-debated target of reducing emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000, as enunciated at the 1992 summit meeting in Rio de Janeiro, is too demanding. It would be more prudent to start slowly, then gradually grow more strict. We need to emulate the tortoise, not the hare.</p>
        <p>* Reducing reliance on fossil fuels is not an anti-growth policy. It is an insurance policy against climatic disruptions that could severely damage the world's economies. We do not want people to turn off the heat and turn in their cars. We do need to make fossil fuels more expensive. But any revenues raised from, say, auctioning emissions permits should be promptly returned to the economy via tax cuts, research and development spending, and compensating victims (for example, coal miners).</p>
        <p>These four principles do not constitute an instruction manual for American negotiators in Bonn. Nonetheless, accepting them would represent a giant step toward banishing both Chicken Little and Dr. Pangloss from the debate. Then we can get down to issues like how to design and enforce a global emissions trading system in the absence of any meaningful global government, and how to persuade developing nations to participate.</p>
        <p>No, the sky is not falling; it is just filling up with greenhouse gases a bit too fast for comfort. But blithely assuming that nature and laissez-faire will take care of everything amounts to betting the earth's climate on a roll of the dice. If we lose the bet, our grandchildren will not likely forgive us. Nor should they.</p>
