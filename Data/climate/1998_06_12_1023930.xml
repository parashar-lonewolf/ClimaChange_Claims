      <block class="full_text">
        <p>There was the article last February about the three twentysomething White House interns sitting hunched over vodka martinis in a Washington bar, ''feverishly speculating about the details of President Clinton's sex life.''</p>
        <p>In that same issue, there was the article about how environmental special interest groups, like ''Truth in Science, a Christian organization skeptical of global warming,'' and the ''Association for the Advancement of Sound Water Policy,'' use weather reports to advance their own agendas.</p>
        <p>And in December 1997, there was one about advertisements encouraging employees to tell on their bosses. ''Ads by a Texas drug-testing lab encourage employees to reveal whether their boss is using narcotics by sending in a few hairs and $115,'' the article said.</p>
        <p>All false. Not one of the above anecdotes or quotes or sources existed. They are instead the handiwork of 25-year-old Stephen Glass, a writer who it now appears made up part or all of these and 24 other articles of the 41 he wrote for The New Republic over the last three years.</p>
        <p>Many details of the case have trickled out since early May, when The New Republic dismissed Mr. Glass for fabricating an article about a computer hacker. But after a monthlong internal investigation, the magazine has offered a much fuller account of the falsifications in an editor's note, published in the issue due on newsstands today. It is an account that would place the case among journalism's notorious scandals, like Janet Cooke's fabrication of the life of an inner-city youth that won the Pulitzer Prize for The Washington Post, and the case of R. Foster Winans, a Wall Street Journal columnist who went to prison for trading stock ahead of publication of his columns.</p>
        <p>The inquiry found that Mr. Glass had completely fabricated six articles and had manufactured material in parts of 21 other articles. Mr. Glass did not return calls seeking comment, but his lawyer, Gerson Zweifach, said in an interview yesterday that his client had confirmed the findings.</p>
        <p>The New Republic is not the only publication that has gone back over Mr. Glass's work in the last few weeks. Mr. Glass published articles in Rolling Stone, George and Harper's -- all of which have conducted investigations of their own and discontinued their contracts with Mr. Glass. The New York Times Magazine was about to publish an article but canceled it when it learned of the case.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Glass's offenses have come to light, the promising young journalist -- a former fact-checker himself -- has emerged as an enigmatic, effective illusionist, who succeeded in duping even the most experienced of editors. His systematic, apparently escalating fakery eluded three respected editors at The New Republic: Andrew Sullivan, Michael Kelly and Charles Lane.</p>
        <p>The case has prompted soul-searching in the media about the effectiveness of fact-checking departments, whether ambitious young  reporters need to be reined in and to what extent editors should second-guess their reporters' accounts.</p>
        <p>How could The New Republic allow Mr. Glass to repeatedly use anonymous sources? Because Mr. Glass was considered a hard-working, trustworthy member of the staff, editors who worked with him say, fact-checkers gave him the benefit of the doubt. ''When you're working together with someone,'' Mr. Lane said, ''you assume you're being dealt with in good faith.''</p>
        <p>But editors who worked with Mr. Glass say fact-checking was not the problem, though it should have been more stringent and will be in the future. The problem was simply that they trusted him.</p>
        <p>''It is not that people at the magazine would look at a Stephen Glass story and not notice that he had some extraordinarily vivid anecdote -- something that was unusually good,'' said Mr. Kelly, who is now a columnist at National Journal. ''He had developed a particular reputation for being able to do this sort of thing over and over again. So, I am afraid there was a certain reaction built up over time of, 'Here's an extraordinary anecdote; that's Steve Glass for you.' Because he did seem like the kind of reporter who could and did deliver the goods to an unusual degree.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Glass might have kept right on passing fiction off as fact had it not been for a dogged editor at the Web site Forbes Digital Tool, who was unable to track down one of the sources in Mr. Glass's hackers article. It was when the editor, Adam L. Penenberg, found that nothing checked out in the article that he alerted Mr. Lane, the editor of The New Republic.</p>
        <p>And the rest has been a study in the ignominious unraveling of a career. Mr. Lane said yesterday that he interrogated Mr. Glass about the hackers article, at first with the help of Mr. Penenberg. Then Mr. Lane demanded that Mr. Glass drive him to the site of a conference featured in Mr. Glass's article that had supposedly taken place on the previous Sunday.</p>
        <p>He said Mr. Glass took him to the lobby of an office building where a security guard and an engineer queried by Mr. Lane said the building is closed on Sundays and that there was no such conference. Mr. Glass finally confessed.</p>
        <p>On June 1, The New Republic published the first of its mea culpas, an editor's note retracting the hackers article and apologizing for three other Glass articles that it could not substantiate: ''Monica Sells,'' Mr. Glass's account of a Maryland convention of political novelty vendors; ''Plotters,'' his account of a Virginia meeting of anti-Clinton activists; and parts of ''Praised Be Greenspan,'' about activities at New York investment banks.</p>
        <p>But, perhaps because The New Republic had been forced to apologize for the plagiarism of another reporter, Ruth Shalit, a few years ago, Mr. Lane felt more was required. So he, along with six members of his staff,  divided up Mr. Glass's articles and rechecked every detail in them -- tracking down anonymous sources through data bases, for example, and reading them back their quotes to determine their accuracy. Mr. Lane said each article was then checked again by a different person to assure that nothing had been missed.</p>
        <p>The New Republic further established that Mr. Glass, who previously headed up the fact-checking department at the magazine, provided fake  supporting material for his articles, such as reporter's notes, names of  Web sites, voice mails and faxes. Mr. Lane said: ''A very frequent tactic of his to elude fact checkers recontacting his sources was to provide them with notes saying, 'This source is very nervous and specifically asks that you not call him back,' even if there was a phone number.''</p>
        <p>After confronting Mr. Glass about the hackers' article, for example, Mr. Lane said Mr. Glass defended his work by presenting fake notes, a phony Web site he had created for Jukt Micronics, the company featured in the article, and a voice mail message for the company (the number turned out to be that of a cellular phone belonging to Mr. Glass's brother in Palo Alto, Calif.).</p>
        <p>While The New Republic had received letters objecting to a few of Mr. Glass's articles during his tenure, Mr. Lane said they were no more or less numerous or vehement than letters written to other reporters about their provocative articles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lane also said no one had threatened legal action.</p>
        <p>Other magazines have been engaging in their own investigations. Rolling Stone, for which Mr. Glass wrote four articles, said so far it stands by the essence of Mr. Glass's articles -- although it has yet to confirm all of his anonymous quotes -- but plans to respond to complaints about Mr. Glass's article on D.A.R.E., an anti-drug program that he also wrote about for The New Republic.</p>
        <p>''It's been a little bit of a shock to the system and that's not bad for journalists to have,'' said Robert Love, Rolling Stone's managing editor. ''We are just going to be more vigilant, more paranoid about everything that we print.''</p>
        <p>Harper's rechecked the one article Mr. Glass did for the magazine -- in which Mr. Glass wrote about working as a telephone psychic -- and found that while certain facts could be confirmed, there was no way to verify statements from anonymous callers. ''We can't retract the story without being able to confirm that it was false,'' said John R. MacArthur, Harper's president and publisher. Mr. MacArthur added that Mr. Glass had not returned the magazine's calls and that the magazine had canceled his contract for two more articles.</p>
        <p>George magazine, for which Mr. Glass wrote three main features and several shorter articles, said it planned to apologize in its coming issue for an article about the presidential adviser Vernon E. Jordan Jr. in which Mr. Glass fabricated quotes from unnamed sources.</p>
        <p>John F. Kennedy Jr., George's  president and editor in chief, also sent a personal letter apologizing to Mr. Jordan.</p>
        <p>After learning of The New Republic's situation, The New York Times Magazine decided not to run an article that Mr. Glass had submitted in draft form, the writer's first for the magazine.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lane said that he and Martin Peretz, chairman of The New Republic, had received letters of apology from Mr. Glass this week. ''Thus ends an unpleasant chapter,'' Mr. Peretz said.</p>
        <p>Given that some say Mr. Glass seems to have put as much effort into fabricating his facts as he would have into reporting them, there has been considerable speculation about what would drive a journalist with so much potential to risk his career.</p>
        <p>Mr. Glass, who grew up in Highland Park, Ill., and lives in Washington, D.C., attended the University of Pennsylvania. He went on to work for The Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group, before being hired by The New Republic in 1995.</p>
        <p>Some have suggested that Mr. Glass was overextended, given the number of contracts he was trying to fulfill simultaneously for various publications. He was also in his first year of pursuing a law degree at night at Georgetown University.</p>
        <p>But most people involved say they simply remain mystified and disheartened by Mr. Glass's elaborate charade.</p>
        <p>''I'm very sad at what he's done,'' said Mr. Love of Rolling Stone. ''To work with him was a pleasure. He was a great kid. He is a great kid.''</p>
