        <p>In a speech before the General Assembly highlighted by his implicit criticism of the United States, the President of Brazil, Fernando Collor de Mello, said today that there was "an inescapable obligation" for nations to accept mandatory measures to protect the environment.</p>
        <p>"Just as the question of development has yielded to other issues on the international agenda, I am concerned that the issue of the environment may also yield to other aspects of the day-to-day life of the world," said Mr. Collor, whose country is to be the site of the first Earth Summit in June.</p>

        <p>In a speech before the General Assembly highlighted by his implicit criticism of the United States, the President of Brazil, Fernando Collor de Mello, said today that there was "an inescapable obligation" for nations to accept mandatory measures to protect the environment.</p>
        <p>"Just as the question of development has yielded to other issues on the international agenda, I am concerned that the issue of the environment may also yield to other aspects of the day-to-day life of the world," said Mr. Collor, whose country is to be the site of the first Earth Summit in June.</p>
        <p>The first day of general debate of the 46th General Assembly featured few surprises from the 14 speakers who went before the 166 member nations.</p>
        <p>Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran delivered a speech almost totally devoted to discussion of the "New World Order." He ended his 30-minute speech with brief mentions of what he called the three major crises of the last several decades, the "Iraqi aggression" against Kuwait, Afghanistan and the issue of a Palestinian homeland.  Harking Back to the Environment</p>
        <p>Iran has privately been at the center of efforts brokered by the United Nations to release Western hostages in Lebanon, but Mr. Velayati made no reference to that issue.</p>
        <p>The speeches today were filled with prescriptions for peace and references to the "New World Order." But the environment was a recurring theme, from Mr. Collor's lightly veiled chastisement of the United States to an impassioned plea by President Bailey Olter of Micronesia to industrialized nations that use tiny South Pacific islands as dumping grounds.</p>
        <p>"Our region cannot be considered by the larger nations as a convenient empty space for the disposal of toxic and hazardous waste and chemicals and radioactive materials," Mr. Olter said.</p>
        <p>Leading off the speakers, Mr. Collor's comments increased pressure on the United States to end its opposition to a series of proposals dealing with global warming and other environmental issues.</p>
        <p>The third of five international meetings called to formulate a host of agreements to be voted on in Brazil at the Conference on Environment and Development ended last Friday in Nairobi, Kenya. The United States was still resisting efforts to set mandatory cuts in emissions of carbon dioxide. Scientists say carbon monoxide is the main manmade gas contributing to global warming.  Tracing the Responsibility</p>
        <p>The European Community and Japan favor reducing carbon-dioxide emissions to the levels of last year by the year 2000. But the United States, the biggest producer of carbon dioxide, argues that too little is known about the warming threat to justify the costs of trying to adhere to mandatory limits.</p>
        <p>In comments seemingly directed toward the United States, Mr. Collor said, "Lasting solutions to global problems require the commitment of the international community as a whole, each country according to its responsibility relating to the origin of these problems and to their management, as well as to its economic and technological capacity to overcome them."</p>
        <p>The United States' objections could impede chances for a treaty at the meeting in Brazil. There are also other obstacles like demands by the United States and other developed nations for language to reduce the depletion of forests and waterways in many underdeveloped nations.</p>
        <p>"The conference should not set the stage for grievances and recrimination," Mr. Collor said. "It should, on the contrary, provide the framework for mature and feasible proposals."</p>
        <p>Mr. Collor, who said the Brazil meeting would allow a debate as broad and profound "as the political will of the participants will allow," was supported by New Zealand, whose Prime Minister, J. B. Bolger, said, "Next year's United Nations conference in Brazil will be the real test of our ability to cooperate in the endeavor to find the proper balance between development and environmental protection."</p>
        <p>Other speakers included the Foreign Ministers of Angola, Australia, Burkina Faso, Iceland, Mexico, Norway and Sri Lanka.</p>
