        <p>Iraq told the top two United Nations arms inspectors that it had found four more empty chemical weapons warheads similar to the 12 discovered last week. The disclosure came in a meeting between Iraqi officials and the inspectors, who returned to Baghdad to urge the government to intensify cooperation with inspection teams.</p>

        <p>In Israel, More Conflicts  An Israeli court set a trial date for a Palestinian leader on charges of involvement in attacks that killed 26 people, though he contends it does not have the right to try him. In Hebron, the funeral of a settler who was killed in an attack by Palestinian gunmen turned into a conflict over where to bury him and then a full-scale riot.</p>

        <p>Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel accused European states of bias in favor of the Palestinians, criticizing their role in an American-backed plan for Middle East peace.</p>

        <p>Iran Cleric Backs Dissident  A high-ranking reformist cleric denounced the house arrest of a dissident who has challenged the authority of Iran's supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and called on other high-ranking clerics to press for his release.</p>

        <p>Libya Set to Win Rights Post  Libya, long accused by human rights activists of major abuses, is set to win the chairmanship of the United Nations' top rights body despite strong opposition from the United States.</p>

        <p>Hope in Korea Nuclear Crisis  The United States and North Korea inched closer toward a resolution of a crisis over nuclear weapons development with American offers of economic cooperation and North Korean calls for dialogue.</p>
        <p>A14</p>
        <p>Russia Helped U.S. in Spying  Russian intelligence officers secretly placed sophisticated nuclear monitors provided by the C.I.A. inside the Russian Embassy in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, in an effort to detect signs of activity from the weapons program during the 1990's.</p>

        <p>30 Years After Roe Ruling, New Trends but No Answers  The rate of abortions has come almost full circle since Roe v. Wade, declining to its lowest level since 1974. Increasingly, the common denominator for women who have abortions is poverty.</p>

        <p>Aides on Affirmative Action  The two highest-ranking African-Americans in the Bush administration took differing positions on the affirmative action case before the Supreme Court. Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, praised the president's stance against the University of Michigan's use of race in its admissions program. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell refused to do so.</p>

        <p>Ships to Carry Bulk of Supplies  More than 95 percent of the fuel, ammunition and mat√©riel that would be used in an attack against Iraq, would flow into the Persian Gulf region by ship, military experts say. And the cargo fleet is more prepared to move quickly than in the past.</p>

        <p>More Anti-War Protests  A band of demonstrators against action in Iraq tried without success to provoke mass arrests a block from the White House a day after widespread anti-war protests.</p>

        <p>Mayor Promotes His Plan  Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg visited four churches in Harlem to talk up his plan to overhaul the city's public school system, honor the memory of the Rev.

        <p>Medicaid Limits Possible  The Bush administration recently presented state Medicaid directors across the country with a unattractive option: letting them limit coverage of emergency services for the poor. Gov. George E. Pataki has been pleading with the White House to shoulder a greater portion of the state's Medicaid burden for more than a year.</p>
