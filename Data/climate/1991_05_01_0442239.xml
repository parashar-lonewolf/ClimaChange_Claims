        <p>Former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts began a long-shot campaign for the Presidency today with a scornful indictment of "Washington mediocrity" and a plea for "a different path" toward economic and political renewal.</p>
        <p>With a quietly reflective speech here and in his hometown of Lowell, Mass., Mr. Tsongas became the first official candidate of the 1992 Presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>"Today I begin a journey of purpose," he said at an outdoor rally in Lowell, where hundreds of supporters listened stoically through a driving rain. "I ask you to come with me."</p>
        <p>Mr. Tsongas (the name is pronounced SONG-guss) enters a race for the Democratic Presidential nomination that seems frozen by the war in the Persian Gulf, the remarkable popularity of President Bush and the fear among many Democrats that the President is all but unbeatable. Democrats from the Rev. Jesse Jackson to Senator Al Gore of Tennessee have been considering a race, but only Mr. Tsongas, who left the Senate six years ago because he had cancer, has taken the plunge. 'Values of Our Ancestors'</p>
        <p>The 50-year-old Massachusetts Democrat, who underwent a successful bone marrow transplant five years ago, seemed untroubled today by the conventional wisdom, which holds that his chances for the nomination are slim. Indeed, he offered his candidacy as an antidote to politics-as-usual, seeming to play to the same restless mood among voters that showed up in numerous public opinion polls and some elections last year.</p>
        <p>He talked of returning to "the values of our ancestors" and of recognizing the nation's responsibility to future generations by refusing to burden them with a spoiled environment and a bloated Federal debt. "In the Apache tongue the word for grandfather and grandson is the same," said Mr. Tsongas, surrounded by his wife and three daughters. "They understood linkage. They understood honor. They understood mutual obligation.</p>
        <p>"In Washington there is no such wisdom. It is all here and now. It is all polling data. The vision extends only to the next election."</p>
        <p>This failure of political leadership, Mr. Tsongas said, has left the nation drifting, falling far short of its destiny. "We were never meant to be the world's greatest debtor nation," he said. "We were never meant to have American workers rank ninth in the world in wages. We were never meant to have dysfunctional schools or imploding cities or racial disharmony or an evironment at risk." A Harder, Steeper Path</p>
        <p>In contrast to the made-for-television messages of most political speeches, Mr. Tsongas's announcement speech had an almost mystical tone. "I offer a different path," he said, "harder but more hopeful, longer but more compelling, steeper but more worthy."</p>
        <p>He compared the political journey facing the nation to his own journey past cancer. "Born out of that adversity was a commitment to devote myself to those people and to those issues that truly matter to me," he said.</p>
        <p>So far, Mr. Tsongas's campaign has revolved around what he sees as the nation's serious economic decline, and he says this demands new thinking and new policies, like a more aggressive Federal role in helping businesses develop new technologies. He presents himself as a pro-business liberal who is committed to an "economic renaissance," and he breaks with fellow Democrats on several issues.  A Loyal Audience in Lowell</p>
        <p>Mr. Tsongas supports a carefully targeted cut in the tax on capital gains to encourage investment. He backs nuclear power as a means of easing the nation's dependence on fossil fuels, a stance he did not mention here in New Hampshire, where the issue has long been controversial. And he backs a free trade pact with Mexico, an issue that has caused bitter debate among Democrats.</p>
        <p>His announcement in Lowell this morning drew a loyal audience that came packing umbrellas and determined enthusiasm. "He's a hometown guy, what do you think?" said David Gannon, when asked where he stood on Mr. Tsongas.</p>
        <p>The new candidate delivered his speech against a backdrop of renovated textile mills, intended to reflect the economic development projects that Mr. Tsongas pushed for during much of his political career. Still, the "Massachusetts miracle" that Michael S. Dukakis rode to the Democratic nomination three years ago has long since faded.</p>
        <p>From Lowell, Mr. Tsongas drove to New Hampshire, where the nation's first Presidential primary will be held early next year, then flew on to Iowa, which holds the first caucuses. In New Hampshire he spoke on the Manchester campus of the University of New Hampshire, where some Democratic politicians shied away from assessing his chances but noted that he certainly had an opportunity to fill a void.</p>
        <p>"It seems there's few other Democrts with the courage or the wherewithal to jump into the field," said Joseph Grandmaison, former state Democratic chairman. "That gives him an opportunity."</p>
        <p>Peggy Connolly, spokeswoman for the campaign, said the response of much of the Democratic establishment was "cordial but not enthusiastic." She said Mr. Tsongas, whose campaign at the moment has a full-time paid staff of three, would obviously not be "the Democratic Party establishment candidate."</p>
        <p>Still, he plans several trips to Iowa, including a two-week stay there in July. And his announcement tour this week will also take him to Denver, Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco, San Jose, Calif., and Tampa, Fla.</p>
        <p>The campaign is clearly sensitive to the issue of Mr. Tsongas's health, making the candidate's physician, Dr. Tak Takvorian, generally available. Dr. Takvorian, who treated Mr. Tsongas for lymphoma, said the former Senator has shown no sign of the disease since he underwent the bone marrow transplant in 1986.</p>
        <p>Regardless of Mr. Tsongas's chances for the nomination, there was the reassuring air today of the old rituals of Presidential campaigns grinding forward once again: the bus motorcades from Manchester to Logan International Airport in Boston, the New Hampshire pols sizing up a candidate, the audiences willing and eager for applause lines. "Let's go!" Mr. Tsongas exclaimed at Lowell today -- and with a lurch, the campaign began anew.
