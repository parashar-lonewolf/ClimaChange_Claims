        <p>SINCE 1994, when the Northrop-Grumman plant assembled its last F-14 and E-2 aircraft here, the 2,900-acre naval weapons facility has been in a holding pattern. Amid a host of development proposals, ranging from a golf course to a cargo airport, Riverhead's political and business leaders have been unable to decide on a course that would best replace the jobs and tax revenue that took flight when Northrop-Grumman abandoned its aircraft facility.</p>
        <p>But last week's announcement of a new technology incubator, along with the near-final sale of 493 acres to Burman Properties for $17 million, signals that Calverton is moving toward a new economic frontier.</p>
        <p>An incubator is designed to promote business growth by offering services to new businesses that ordinarily would not be able to afford them. The Calverton project would offer below-market rent for the three to five years that companies would stay there. The businesses would have access to laboratories, conference rooms and classrooms. The State University of New York at Stony Brook would operate the incubator, and its Small Business Development Center would consult. Companies could also get academic and research support.</p>
        <p>The 50-acre business incubator is scheduled to open by the end of next year. A town hearing will take place Nov. 8 before Stony Brook receives the final go-ahead from the town planning board to proceed with a subdivision plan. Sources, including the senator who has lobbied for the project and the executive director of a local development agency, believe the hearing is largely a formality because of wide support for the project across business, political and environmental lines.</p>
        <p>Tentatively, the incubator is to be placed along Route 25, just east of the 25A intersection. Yet several members of the town board, who feel that a site along Route 25 is too commercially valuable to give to Stony Brook, are still lobbying for an alternative location on the property.  This last-minute tussle is one example of why it has taken six years for the town of Riverhead to develop any economic momentum with the site, the largest single lot of commercial property now being sold in New York State. It had been declared surplus by the United States Navy and was turned over to the town of Riverhead in 1998 for commercial development.</p>
        <p>''The word out there in the business community has been that there have been too many false starts,'' Senator Ken LaValle said. ''I think now the Riverhead government and community are recognizing that the state is making an enormous investment that will jump-start development in Riverhead. It will be the first project that will come to fruition rather than 'talk talk talk.' ''</p>
        <p>The business incubator will center around aquaculture, agriculture and environmental technologies. Since 1994, Mr. LaValle, who helped secure $3 million for the incubator from New York State's Science, Technology and Academic Research program, has been lobbying for its creation as a more environmentally friendly alternative to a cargo airport that had once been proposed.</p>
        <p>''We wanted to have industries that were compatible with the East End of Long Island, and that would add to our economy and to the resolution of some of the problems that we are facing,'' Mr. LaValle said.</p>
        <p>Beach preservation technologies, fish farming, underwater development of drugs and cosmetics, crop production and distribution, and renewable energy are some industries the incubator would promote.</p>
        <p>The $3 million in state financing would be spent on the construction of a 17,000-square-foot building for 12 to 15 tenants, according to Monique Gablenz, the executive director of the Riverhead Industrial Development Agency. Companies are qualified if they are concluding their research and development phase, and are trying to move into commercialization of their product in any of the three areas of focus.</p>
        <p>''Very often these research companies are in an expansive phase and are trying so hard to activate research and development that they don't have the time and staffing to concentrate on business aspects,'' Ms. Gablenz said.</p>
        <p>For example, a company that has been developing alternative pesticides would seek a place at the incubator once it was ready to adapt its findings for commercial use.</p>
        <p>The incubator, Ms. Gablenz said, would provide companies with the business and research support they need to graduate into economically viable companies -- companies that would take root in Riverhead.</p>
        <p>''The odds are they will not want to move away from support services they've developed,'' said Ms. Gablenz.</p>
        <p>''These companies will also be better able to identify funding sources for the continuation of the work,'' Ms. Gablenz said.</p>
        <p>There are many small business incubators on Long Island, but not all are successful. The ones that thrive  have the ability to create lasting relationships among academic, financial and governmental lines of support, said Michelle Stark, a business consultant at the SUNY Stony Brook Small Business Development Center and co-author of the incubator feasibility study.</p>
        <p>''The biggest problem that emerging technology companies face on Long Island,'' Ms. Stark said, ''is where to go after they graduate from the incubators. After spending so much effort creating relationships in the research community, they don't want to cut the umbilical cord completely. They will want to continue to use graduate students and other support programs offered throughout the university to commercialize technology.</p>
        <p>''And from a logistical point of view, the supplier networks and telecommunications infrastructure that has been already been built up in that geographic core should continue to be accessible,'' Ms. Stark said.</p>
        <p>Government and business officials in Riverhead believe the incubator is a harbinger of great economic promise. It is hoped that successful graduates will find a home next door in the industrial park planned by Jay Burman. There, they can provide manufacturing and executive jobs that the town's retail sector cannot offer.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gablenz is also confident that the incubator will benefit from the expertise that Stony Brook has developed in the management of its biotechnology incubator.</p>
        <p>''The university has been extremely successful, and has enjoyed full occupancy since its doors have opened. It continues to graduate companies that have stayed in the area,'' Ms. Gablenz said.</p>
        <p>SUNY Stony Brook will market the Calverton project, which will begin construction this spring, in the hope that it will be fully occupied by the time its doors open in late 2001.</p>
        <p>By November, Mr. Burman's subdivision plan for the industrial park should be approved, according to Bob Kozakiewicz, the town supervisor of Riverhead.</p>
        <p>The industrial park includes an 850,000-square-foot-facility, two-thirds of which can be filled immediately, given the level of interest expressed by prospective companies, said Jack O'Connor, the executive managing director for Grubb &amp; Ellis, the commercial broker for Riverhead and the 2,900-acre parcel. The park will also include two million square feet of industrial space to be developed mostly for use by manufacturing firms, as specified in Riverhead's 1996 Land Reuse Plan.</p>
        <p>The fate of the remaining 2,400 acres, including two airstrips, is still undecided, although most of the parcel has been rezoned for family recreation uses. Offers are pending for a golf course, a motorcycle racing venue, and a hotel conference and golf center with a private residential community attached. Nothing has been decided, Mr. O'Connor said.</p>
        <p>''Many years ago industries thought Riverhead was the end of the world, but now that western land is saturated, Riverhead is looking like a place to be,'' he said.</p>
