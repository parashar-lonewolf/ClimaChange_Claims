        <p>This year's summer movie season may be remembered not for whether Spider-Man slays Doc Ock, but whether a host of films costing from $125 million to $200 million each succeed or fail. On May 7, Universal Pictures kicks things off with ''Van Helsing,'' the monster-mash movie starring Hugh Jackman. Its budget is conservatively estimated at $150 million.</p>
        <p>Not far behind, 20th Century Fox is releasing ''The Day After Tomorrow,'' a movie about the effects of global warming that has attracted the interest of environmentalists, while Warner Brothers Pictures offers the Iliad-inspired ''Troy,'' with Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom. One movie already has producers counting coins: ''Shrek 2,'' which opens May 21. Even pessimists say it is bound to be a hit.</p>
