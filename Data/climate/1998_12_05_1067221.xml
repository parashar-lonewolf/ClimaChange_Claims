        <p>RUSSIA: A LOW-BUDGET DEFENSE -- The newspaper of the Defense Ministry, Krasnaya Zvezda, said money allocated for the military in Russia's draft budget for 1999 is just enough to feed and clothe soldiers but not to buy new weapons systems, hold maneuvers or maintain troops at combat level. The $5 billion allocation amounts to 2.6 percent of Russia's gross domestic product, or well below the 3.5 percent minimum set by President Boris N. Yeltsin. (Agence France-Presse)</p>
        <p>RUSSIA: PAYING FOR LENIN'S TOMB -- Russia's Parliament rejected moves by the liberal opposition to cut state money for Lenin's mausoleum on Red Square and to force the Communist Party to pay for the tomb's upkeep. The Communists and some of their allies crushed a bid by Grigory A. Yavlinsky's liberal Yabloko party to debate the draft bill by 221 votes to 51. (Agence France-Presse)</p>
        <p>CZECH REPUBLIC: VIENNA MAYOR CLEARED -- A former Mayor of Vienna, Helmut Zilk, has been cleared of spying for Communist Czechoslovakia's secret police in the 1960's, the Czech Embassy in Vienna said. The allegations against Mr. Zilk, first reported in the German press in October, prompted the Czech President, Vaclav Havel, to withdraw the top Czech honor for foreigners that Mr. Zilk had been due to receive. (Reuters)</p>
        <p>POLAND: PERSONAL FILES STAY CLOSED -- President Aleksandr Kwasniewski, a former Communist, vetoed a bill that would have opened personal files compiled by Poland's Communist-era security police. The President's legal adviser, Ryszard Kalisz, told the P.A.P. news agency that the President rejected the bill because it would have granted access only to victims of Communist persecution before 1989 and not to all Poles.

        <p>SAUDI ARABIA: $5 BILLION LOAN SOUGHT -- Plunging oil prices have forced Saudi Arabia to ask the United Arab Emirates for a loan estimated at $5 billion to help finance its budget deficit, The Financial Times reported. The newspaper quoted Saudi bankers as saying the loan would help stave off a budget deficit that could reach $15 billion this year. (Agence France-Presse)</p>
        <p>ISRAEL: KILLER REMAINS A 'MARTYR' -- Israel's Supreme Court has blocked the Government from removing the words ''holy'' and ''martyr'' from the tombstone of a Jewish settler who killed 29 Palestinian worshipers. The gunman, Baruch Goldstein, opened fire on the worshipers in the Tomb of the Patriarchs in February 1994. He was killed by survivors of the attack. (AP)</p>

        <p>ARGENTINA: GRENADE IN THE MAIL -- Gen. Martin Balza, the army commander, received a hand grenade in the mail on the eighth anniversary of the military's last revolt against investigations of its human rights record. The grenade, which was not primed to explode, was the latest in a string of threats against the general. Clifford Krauss (NYT)</p>
        <p>ARGENTINA: BOMBING SUSPECT CHARGED -- An Iranian woman, Nahrim Mokhtari, was charged in connection with the deadly bombings of the Israeli Embassy in 1992 and of a Jewish center in Buenos Aires in 1994. Ms. Mokhtari was detained at the Buenos Aires airport after  she got off a flight from Paris that was bound for Montevideo, Uruguay. (NYT)</p>
        <p>CANADA: COURT DROPS DISPUTE -- The International Court of Justice ruled that it lacked jurisdiction to hear a long-running fisheries dispute between Spain and Canada. Spain made the complaint in 1995 after Canada seized a Spanish trawler in the northwest Atlantic, saying it had to protect its fishing stocks.  (Reuters)</p>
        <p>ANTARCTICA: HOLE IN OZONE GROWS -- The hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica reached record size in the past three months, the World Meteorological Organization said. The atmosphere's ozone layer provides protection from harmful ultraviolet rays, and the size of the hole is considered a barometer of the thickness and condition of the protective layer encircling the globe.

        <p>INDIA: CHRISTIANS PROTEST ATTACKS -- Tens of thousands of Christians protested against attacks this year by Hindus on Christians and Christian institutions in some Indian states. The protesters held rallies and many Christian schools closed for the day. India has 2.3 million Christians in a population of about 970 million. Celia W. Dugger (NYT)</p>
        <p>HONG KONG: ERASING SIGNS OF BRITAIN -- China is stripping away one of the most visible remnants of Britain's colonial presence in Hong Kong. Workers are removing the name from the Prince of Wales Building, which became the army headquarters after China took control of Hong Kong 17 months ago. The army said it had not decided on a new name. Mark Landler (NYT)</p>
        <p>CAMBODIA: COALITION GETS U.N. SEAT -- The newly installed coalition Government of Prime Minister Hun Sen was awarded Cambodia's vacant seat in the General Assembly. The coalition includes the opposition party of Prince Norodim Ranariddh, who was driven from office in a July 1997 coup. The seat has been vacant since September 1997.  Barbara Crossette (NYT)</p>
        <p>BANGLADESH: SETBACK FOR DIVORCED WOMEN -- The Bangladeshi Supreme Court overturned a verdict entitling a divorced wife to alimony from her former husband until her remarriage or death. The ruling restored a law requiring a Muslim husband to pay his ex-wife alimony for only three months, The Daily Star reported. (Agence France-Presse)</p>
        <p>JAPAN: A CALL TO HELP THE AGING -- Japan's rapidly aging society requires urgent reforms of wage, pension and nursing systems to insure the welfare of older citizens, the Government said. The Economic Planning Agency estimates that the number of Japanese over 65 will reach 31 million by 2015, or 25 percent of the overall population. (AP)</p>
