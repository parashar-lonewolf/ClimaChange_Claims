        <p>Mayor Dinkins demonstrates courageous leadership in his apparent decision to move forward with a plan to develop three state-of-the-art incinerators to deal with New York City's mounting trash problem. The decision will surely bring abuse from those who mistakenly believe that incineration of garbage is both dangerous and unnecessary. They are wrong, and the Mayor is right.</p>
        <p>New York produces about 25,000 tons of solid waste every day. The Sanitation Department picks up 14,000 tons, mainly from apartment buildings. The rest is scooped up by private contractors who handle commercial, construction and hazardous wastes.</p>

        <p>Mayor Dinkins demonstrates courageous leadership in his apparent decision to move forward with a plan to develop three state-of-the-art incinerators to deal with New York City's mounting trash problem. The decision will surely bring abuse from those who mistakenly believe that incineration of garbage is both dangerous and unnecessary. They are wrong, and the Mayor is right.</p>
        <p>New York produces about 25,000 tons of solid waste every day. The Sanitation Department picks up 14,000 tons, mainly from apartment buildings. The rest is scooped up by private contractors who handle commercial, construction and hazardous wastes.</p>
        <p>It's everyone's hope that recycling, though expensive to operate and hard to organize, will gradually account for more tonnage. Landfilling, given dwindling capacity and resistance to new landfills, has a limited future. To reduce the remaining non-recyclable waste, incineration, which also produces electric power, becomes essential. State-of-the-art incineration reduces residues by as much as 90 percent; the electricity is sold to reduce the cost of handling waste and the burning of other fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>Those who complain of air pollution tend to ignore the progress in designing and operating incineration plants. Modern incinerators in many cities operate without odor or smoke; their pollution control and collection systems filter the stack gases while high-temperature burning limits the production of dioxins and furins.</p>
        <p>The Dinkins plan reduces from five to three the number of new incineration plants that would be built, but provides for the modernization of three older plants. The broad outlines of the plan suggest that the city will move forward with recycling, landfilling and incineration to avoid that crisis in public health that would result if the Fresh Kills landfill ran out of space.</p>
        <p>It is already late in the day to stave off that disaster. To do so will require financing the recycling program beyond the December cut-off established in the budget negotiations. It will also require public acceptance of state-of-the-art incinerators.</p>
