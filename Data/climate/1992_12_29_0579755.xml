        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Scientists are finding environmental threats to the Arctic in DDT, dioxin, heavy metals, chronic oil leaks, severe air pollution and acid raid deposits. This goes further than the risks to the Arctic people and environment from radioactive contamination, PCB's, ozone loss and global warming that you report in three Science Times articles Nov. 24.</p>
        <p>The Arctic is no longer remote and pristine. It is now threatened, from all sides, by human activities. We are just discovering the extent of pollution, much of which was hidden by the cloak of secrecy of the cold war. The Environmental Defense Fund's assessment shows graphically that pollution crosses national borders in the Arctic, with impacts far beyond the original source areas.</p>
        <p>Air pollution, mostly from industrial sites in Eurasia, is transported to the north and trapped in the Arctic air mass, resulting in pollutant levels in winter that can rival those of Los Angeles. Water pollution, transported in the giant river networks that drain most of northern Asia, transport contaminants from agriculture and industry into the Arctic Ocean.</p>
        <p>In 1991, the eight Arctic rim countries -- United States, Canada, Iceland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland and the former Soviet Union -- adopted an Arctic environmental protection strategy (including an Arctic assessment and monitoring program), which recognized the need to cooperate in identifying and combating risks to the Arctic. The strategy, if effectively implemented, could be a useful tool to this end. But this requires that the United States give it much higher priority and support.</p>
        <p>This month, the eight Arctic countries, meeting under the umbrella of the strategy, agreed to adopt an Arctic-wide monitoring plan to provide new information on the extent of risks, including radioactivity. The technical agencies in the United States that would take the leading roles in this plan -- the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -- have been given only minimal resources for the job.</p>
        <p>The State Department has recently indicated it will accord higher priority to the Arctic, including creation of a Federal Arctic advisory committee and review of United States Arctic policy, which dates back well before the end of the cold war. This must still be translated into reality, and much greater Government attention to the Arctic is required.</p>
        <p>Laws and treaties relevant to the Arctic must also be strengthened to provide sufficient protection for the Arctic environment. A new and comprehensive Arctic treaty should be negotiated to insure that Arctic environmental threats and proposed development activities are fully addressed. The problems that we know of now may be only the tip of the iceberg.  STEPHANIE L. PFIRMAN, SCOTT A. HAJOST, KATHLEEN CRANE New York, Dec. 9, 1992</p>
        <p>The writers are, respectively, a senior scientist, international counsel and consultant of the Environmental Defense Fund.</p>
