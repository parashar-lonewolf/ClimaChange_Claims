        <p>In his 12 years in government, Frank M. Lemay has always strived to fit the profile of the ideal bureaucrat, working overtime to make his superiors look smart on such specialties as Colombian coffee quotas and reducing greenhouse gases, and above all never getting his name in print.</p>

        <p>In his 12 years in government, Frank M. Lemay has always strived to fit the profile of the ideal bureaucrat, working overtime to make his superiors look smart on such specialties as Colombian coffee quotas and reducing greenhouse gases, and above all never getting his name in print.</p>
        <p>Even his self-portrait is self-effacing.</p>
        <p>"I'm not a pushover, and if I want something done a certain way I'll make my views known," the slightly built Foreign Service officer said in an interview in his remarkably neat postage-stamp-sized office in the Bureau of Legislative Affairs. "But I've always been a behind-the-scenes, pretty standard bureaucrat who doesn't seek out the limelight."</p>
        <p>But the limelight is exactly where Mr. Lemay finds himself, hauled before Congress to be hailed by Democrats as a fearless Cassandra, frozen out by his State Department superiors as a whistleblower, and worse -- pooh-poohed by the President himself on national television.</p>
        <p>The 35-year-old economist's cocoon of anonymity disappeared on March 30 when Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat, disclosed in a speech on the House floor the contents of a classified memo -- one of many he had requested from the State Department -- that Mr. Lemay wrote in October 1989. The Famous Memo</p>
        <p>With a bluntness rare in diplomatese, the memo warned of evidence that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq had misused a United States farm-loan program to buy nuclear-related equipment, adding that a Federal investigation into the Atlanta bank that had been the primary lender could "blow the roof off."</p>
        <p>"If smoke indicates fire, we may be facing a four-alarm blaze in the near future," Mr. Lemay wrote to his superiors in the office of the Under Secretary for Economic Affairs, urging caution in approving new credit guarantees.</p>
        <p>It was a caution not taken, as $500 million in new credits of a possible $1 billion were extended a few weeks later. The disclosure has thrust Mr. Lemay into a maelstrom about the Bush Administration's policy toward Iraq before the invasion of Kuwait. And under assault, the mild-mannered Mr. Lemay, who once won a State Department award for macro-economic memo-writing under extraordinary pressure, is toughening up. A Tough Response</p>
        <p>After two of the four senior Agriculture Department officials whose briefing was the subject of his memo told Congress that he had been writing fiction, he replied, in sworn testimony, "I was quite taken aback."</p>
        <p>In uncharacteristically strong language, he added: "I had no motivation to make anything up," saying, "I completely stand behind the memo that I wrote. I will take full responsibility for what is said in there."</p>
        <p>On the surface Mr. Lemay, who sometimes omits please-and-thank-you politesse in conversations with subordinates, remains dispassionate.</p>
        <p>"I saw this attack as very personal," he said in the clipped, understated tone he used before the committee. "It impugned my professional reputation, and it was very important to me to put things straight. I wasn't a firebrand screaming, 'Kill the program!' I was simply concerned that people review the allegations."</p>
        <p>But colleagues say that the experience has turned his life upside down. A bachelor who spends much of his spare time laboriously renovating an old row house in the ethnically mixed Mount Pleasant section of Washington, he suddenly found himself spending most of his waking hours trying to reconstruct the events of three years ago, a task made more difficult because the State Department has been unable to locate his files.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lemay has been shunned by his superiors, these colleagues say, a result of the chilling effect of charges by some Congressional Democrats of Administration criminality.</p>
        <p>Even some senior officials sympathetic to Mr. Lemay's plight defend their reluctance to talk to him, saying they do not want to be accused of advising him in ways that Congressional Democrats would construe as a cover-up.</p>
        <p>None of his superiors offered to review his testimony or wished him luck before his committee appearance, or called him afterward to congratulate him on a job well done, his colleagues say, a point Mr. Lemay is unwilling to talk about. The State Department legal adviser, Edwin D. Williamson, met with him briefly before his testimony but offered no legal assistance; Mr. Lemay has paid a personal lawyer to represent him. The Few Who Back Him</p>
        <p>"It was important in the Lemay case that it not appear that he was being coached or primed or coerced in whatever testimony he gave," says Mr. Williamson, explaining State Department tiptoeing. "Our advice to him was to tell the truth, to stick to what he knew personally and to avoid speculation. It was my impression that he was not hung out to dry and that he had access to the documents that he needed to the extent that they were available."</p>
        <p>When asked whether Mr. Lemay might get the impression he was being ostracized by the Department, Mr. Williamson replied, "You probably can't have it both ways."</p>
        <p>Only Mr. Lemay's former superiors have come to his defense publicly.</p>
        <p>"He is a person of the highest integrity who did an excellent job in the time he served in my office," said Richard T. McCormack, the former Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs who assigned his young assistant to look into the farm-credit program. Sam Hoskinson, Mr. Lemay's immediate superior, who has since returned to the Central Intelligence Agency, said, "I have not seen any better than Lemay." What Bush Didn't Know</p>
        <p>Much to Mr. Lemay's dismay, his testimony even caught the attention of President Bush, who has become progressively more flustered in explaining his pre-war Iraq policy.</p>
        <p>When asked about the memo, he sputtered, denying that the State Department ever knew about the diversion, which in fact remains unproven. "You can talk about what one State Department employee -- and if we had known it, it wouldn't have happened," he said on a network news program on July 1.</p>
        <p>The stakes are high. Democrats are determined to make the matter an election issue, while Republicans are worried that what was once regarded as Mr. Bush's greatest triumph as President, the Persian Gulf war, has been transformed unfairly into one of his most significant political liabilities.</p>
        <p>State Department officials close to Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d play down the significance of Mr. Lemay's memo. They point out that the allegations he highlighted -- that a United States loan program may have paid for Iraqi arms -- are still only allegations.</p>
        <p>And although they acknowledge that Mr. Baker was fully aware of them from memos and briefings, they say that the policy of providing Iraq with incentives, ordered by Mr. Bush less than two weeks before Mr. Lemay wrote his memo, was too important to be slowed down by unsubstantiated reports.</p>
        <p>"The issue was brought to the attention of all the big boys and Baker was aware of all the assertions through the huge paper trail," said one official. "We knew Saddam Hussein wasn't a saint and there was this bank thing in Atlanta, but we couldn't cut off a policy based on hunches and assertions. Frank Lemay didn't report anything differently from other people. His problem was that he put it in more bombastic language."</p>
        <p>Still, the memo was deemed so sensitive that when it reached Mr. Baker's outer office, it was stamped with a highly unusual designation: "Not For the System." The designation, which prevents distribution throughout the bureaucracy, is used only for highly secret or highly embarrassing information. No one seems to know, or wants to say, which this memo was. The Loan Deal Goes Through</p>
        <p>On Oct. 6, well before what has come to be called the "bells and whistles memo" arrived in his office, Mr. Baker told Iraq's Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, that "he would immediately look into what could be done" to resolve the matter and that he was eager for the loan to proceed, according to a summary of the meeting.</p>
        <p>Because Mr. McCormack and Mr. Hoskinson were still wary, Mr. Lemay was sent to the Agriculture Department for a briefing on the credit program and the continuing Federal investigation of the bank.</p>
        <p>Indeed, it was only after the State Department's legal adviser concluded that there was no overwhelming reason not to go forward with the full $1 billion program that Mr. McCormack "saw the writing on the wall," as one confidant put it. He approved the program.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lemay, who is to become staff economist for the State Department's policy planning staff, has a poster in his office that says "Wanted -- by the U.S. Congress," with his photo in the center.</p>
        <p>Department officials point to his assignment to a key policy-making office as proof that he is not being punished for his words.</p>
        <p>"I'm a soft-spoken economist, hero-pariah," he said of his current status, laughing. "No, just kidding."</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 15, 1992, Wednesday</p>
        <p>Because of an editing error, a Washington at Work article on Monday about Frank M. Lemay, a Foreign Service officer, misstated the position of Richard T. McCormack, a former Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, on new credit guarantees to Iraq in 1989. Mr. McCormack approved the program on the condition that the guarantees be provided in stages and that the program include safeguards.</p>
