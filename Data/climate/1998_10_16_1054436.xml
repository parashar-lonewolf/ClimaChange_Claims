        <p>INTERNATIONAL  A3-13</p>
        <p>NATO Warning to Milosevic On Kosovo Withdrawal  NATO told President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia that he has until tomorrow to reduce his forces in Kosovo or face a renewed threat of air strikes, though it looked increasingly unlikely that such a threat will be carried out. A1</p>
        <p>Clinton Opens Mideast Summit  President Clinton opened a four-day summit in Maryland between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat. Promising his own intense involvement and the authority of the United States behind a Middle East peace agreement, Mr. Clinton urged the Israeli and Palestinian leaders to ''break the logjam'' and take the risks required to provide hope to their peoples.  A8</p>
        <p>A group of ultranationalist Jews established a beachhead for new conflict in East Jerusalem, occupying a vacant house in the heart of a Palestinian neighborhood. Asserting that the house was an old Sephardic synagogue, they planted an Israeli flag on the roof and carted in an ark and a Torah.  A8</p>
        <p>Pope Issues Encyclical  Pope John Paul II issued an encyclical that denounced the ''fateful separation'' of faith and reason in modern times and set out a Christian alternative to the dominant philosophies of the 20th century -- post-Enlightenment rationalism, Marxism and ''postmodern'' nihilism.  A1</p>
        <p>U.S. Money for the I.M.F.  Clinton Administration officials said they had more political leeway to try new strategies in fighting the continuing global financial turmoil, now that Congress has agreed to inject $18 billion into the depleted coffers of the International Monetary Fund.  A8</p>
        <p>March in Paris Turns Violent  High school students flooded the streets of France again in a two-week-old campaign for more teachers and better schools. The march in Paris turned violent when troublemakers looted stores, burned cars and clashed with riot police. The police arrested at least 110 youths. Five people, including two policemen, were injured.  A3</p>
        <p>Deal on U.N. Dues Falters  A deal that would have allowed the United States to pay $200 million in back dues to the United Nations as part of the overall Federal budget agreement collapsed after the issue became entangled once again in the politics of abortion, Clinton Administration and Congressional officials said.  A5</p>
        <p>Man With Someone Else's Hand  The world's only person with somebody else's fingerprints is expected to leave a French hospital with the transplanted hand and forearm he received there three weeks ago, his doctors said. The patient, Clint Hallam of Australia, underwent the experimental operation after he lost his right hand in an accident with a circular saw in a jail in New Zealand in 1984.  A13</p>
        <p>World Briefing A11</p>
        <p>NATIONAL A16-25</p>
        <p>Capitol and White House Reach Deal on Budget  President Clinton and Congress reached agreement on the nation's $1.7 trillion budget that included the biggest peacetime increase in military spending since Ronald Reagan was President in 1985. Other provisions include money to begin hiring 100,000 elementary teachers and to offer relief for farmers, and $2 billion for medical research at the National Institutes of Health. There is also money for American peacekeeping troops in Bosnia, the tightening of embassy security and the shoring up of depleted I.M.F. reserves. The bill, which Congress is expected to adopt today, also adds money to develop a plan to combat bioterrorism. Federal health plans will have to provide contraceptive coverage for Federal workers, but plans can exempt themselves on religious grounds, and doctors and nurses can exempt themselves on moral grounds. A1</p>
        <p>Most of the more than $1 billion for new teachers will be given to districts based on need. A25</p>
        <p>The fight over statistical sampling in the 2000 census was postponed until the Supreme Court rules. A16</p>
        <p>The White House said it won an additional $476 million for programs involving climate change, water quality and conservation lands, while Republicans won provisions to spend millions more on items like logging and transportation in Alaska. A25</p>
        <p>About $9 billion will be added to the military budget, including about $2 billion for intelligence programs and $1 billion for missile defense. A25</p>
        <p>The deal will let 49,000 Haitian refugees stay in the United States legally, increase the number of specialized foreign workers and earmark $171 million to reduce the backlog of citizenship applications. A25</p>
        <p>Jones Deal Hits a Snag  A financial package intended to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit appeared to fall victim to feuding among her lawyers and Abe Hirschfeld, who had offered Ms. Jones $1 million to withdraw her case. A18</p>
        <p>Warning on Hepatitis C  Thousands of people will soon receive letters warning that they may have caught the liver virus hepatitis C from transfusions before 1992. A21</p>

        <p>Trump Starts a New Tower To Loom Over the U.N.  Donald J. Trump is starting work on what he says will be the tallest residential building in the world, a $360 million, 861-foot, bronze-colored monolith near the United Nations complex. The project, called the Trump World Tower, has rankled some residents, who worry about its effect on the neighborhood. B1</p>
        <p>Absentee Ballots in Jeopardy  Thousands of New York City voters could lose the chance to vote in the Nov. 3 election because the court battle over a referendum on Yankee Stadium has delayed the printing of absentee ballots, the president of the Board of Elections said. B1</p>
        <p>Missing Boy Found With Sitter  A 6-year-old Brooklyn boy with cerebral palsy was found unharmed sitting in a car with his former baby sitter near Richmond, Va. The police said the woman, who was arrested, had taken the child in hope of finding a spiritual healer for him. She faces Federal kidnapping charges. B3</p>
        <p>Arrests in Derelict-Car Scheme  Two dozen sanitation workers in Brooklyn were arrested and accused of using the city's derelict-vehicle program as a ruse to steal hundreds of perfectly good cars. B3</p>

        <p>Fed Abruptly Cuts Rates Again  The Federal Reserve unexpectedly cut interest rates by one-quarter of a percentage point, warning that a growing wave of fear among investors and lenders was threatening to derail the nation's long economic expansion. The unusual timing of the action, which was taken outside one of its regularly scheduled meetings, suggested that the central bank sees the economic outlook deteriorating as the Asian financial crisis hits the United States even harder. A1</p>
        <p>The Fed's action touched off a huge final-hour surge that drove prices up more than 4 percent on the three major market gauges. The Dow gained 330.58 points, to 8,299.36; the S.&amp; P. 500 rose 41.96 points, to 1,047.49, and the Nasdaq climbed 70.04 points, to 1,611.01. Congressional approval of new money for the International Monetary Fund also figured in the rally, experts said. C1</p>
        <p>Health Giant Claims Conspiracy  Columbia/HCA Healthcare sued one of its former top financial officers and several vendors, accusing them of engaging in a conspiracy over seven years that defrauded the company of millions of dollars. C1</p>
