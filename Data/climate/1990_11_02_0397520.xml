        <p>Sergej A. Lebedeff, an atmospheric scientist and a member of the atmospheric research team at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in Manhattan, died on Monday at his home in Norwalk, Conn. He was 62 years old.</p>
        <p>He appears to have died of heart failure, a family spokesman said.</p>
        <p>He was a member of the climate modeling group at Goddard that is developing computer models and simulations to study the influence of atmospheric gases on global climate. For the last 30 years, he had studied the nature and causes of global climate change. He had published scientific papers documenting the increase in global temperatures over the last century, which showed that the 1980's was the warmest decade ever recorded.</p>
        <p>Born in the Soviet Union, he studied in Germany and Brazil before earning a Ph.D. in physics at the University of California at Berkeley. He did postdoctoral research at Queen's University in Belfast, at the Max Planck Institute for fluid dynamics in Germany and at Johns Hopkins University.</p>
        <p>For the last 20 years, he carried out research in atmospheric physics at Goddard, an institute of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.</p>
        <p>He is survived by his wife, the former Jean Kreshak, and a sister, Veronika Meekison of Pensacola, Fla.</p>
