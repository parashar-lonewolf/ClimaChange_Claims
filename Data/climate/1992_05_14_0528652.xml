        <p>With 30,000 visitors environmentalists, journalists and heads of state -- expected here next month for a global ecological summit meeting, Rio de Janeiro is unrolling a traditional third-world welcome mat: a new road to the airport.</p>
        <p>Skimming past slums and swamps, the eight-lane highway is part of a $1 billion face lift for a city that hopes to reverse its fading fortunes by playing host to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development from June 3 to June 14. It is the first such gathering since an "Earth Summit" in 1972 in Stockholm.</p>
        <p>Amazon Indians are thatching lodges here for a congress of indigenous peoples, workers are raising white-and-green shelters at a beachfront park for a country fair of environmental groups and carpenters are hammering and sawing night and day to ready conference centers for presidents and prime ministers.  [ President Bush announced on Tuesday that he would join more than 100 world leaders at the meeting. ] An Amateur Photographer</p>
        <p>Catching the spirit, Brazil's athletic President, Fernando Collor de Mello, has given up his usual weekend activities -- flying fighter jets or test-driving tanks. Instead, he hikes the savannah around Brasilia, photographing wildflowers for a book to present visiting world leaders.</p>
        <p>Dashing hopes held by environmentalists a year ago, world leaders are not expected to sign substantive agreements here on controlling carbon dioxide gases, preserving forests and preserving biological diversity.</p>
        <p>Reflecting environmentalists' growing anger, Carlos Minc, a founder of Brazil's Green Party, plans to erect a "Mendacity Meter" outside the conference hall that will ring bells and flash lights every time an operator watching a closed-circuit television deems that falsehoods are emanating from the hall.</p>
        <p>Beyond the official meeting, controversy has also spiced plans for parallel events by Indians and non-governmental groups. Not Quite 'Non-Governmental'</p>
        <p>The largest unofficial meeting will be Global Forum, where registrants can browse among 400 workshops and 650 exhibition stands. The 10,250 registrants represent 2,202 groups from 116 nations.</p>
        <p>Although Global Forum proudly calls itself non-governmental, organizers threatened last week to fold their green-and-white tents in Flamengo Park if governments did not cover the $11 million budget for the forum's security, meeting halls, press center and other services.</p>
        <p>Faced with the ultimatum, European governments and Brazilian federal, state and municipal governments filled the budget gap.</p>
        <p>Warren H. Lindner, an American lawyer who coordinates the forum, argues that government sponsorship is reasonable for a meeting that he calculates will bring Rio $50 million in tourist business.</p>
        <p>"Government delegations are being financed by their treasuries to come down and stay at the Rio Palace with all fares paid," he said, referring to a five-star hotel. "Private institutions are paying their own air fares, meals and hotels at a tune of $6,000 a person." When Indians Burp . . .</p>
        <p>Similar bitterness erupted at Kari Oca, a cluster of traditional Indian shelters under construction a few miles from Riocentro, the conference hall where heads of state are to meet.</p>
        <p>Cultural clashes and accusations of bad faith caused 64 Indians from the Xingu River basin to stop work and to threaten to burn down two wood-and-thatch lodges they were building. The Indians, most of whom had never before left their Amazon villages, complained that they were not given hammocks for sleeping and that a brusque change in diet from fish to sausages gave them indigestion.</p>
        <p>Peace was made through the efforts of Marcos Terena, project coordinator and leader of a group called Intertribal Committee -- 500 Years of Resistance. From May 25 to 30, the group is to be host here to a World Conference of Indigenous Peoples.</p>
        <p>"We want to ask the developed world: What is development? What do poverty and wealth mean?" Mr. Terena said as a delegation of Tikuna Indians from the northern Amazon paused in thatching a lodge with satintail grass. A Clean Machine</p>
        <p>It is costing $1 billion to clean up the city.</p>
        <p>"Rio is a city of many enchantments -- the mountains, the sea," said President Collor, who grew up here in the early 1960's. "But Rio has been very neglected in recent years."</p>
        <p>Delegates will arrive at a newly renovated international airport and will speed down the first highway built here in decades. Throughout town, new ribbons of asphalt cover streets.</p>
        <p>Twenty miles of city beaches have new sidewalks, new food kiosks and new bicycle paths. Later this month, city authorities are to open Latin America's largest recycling plant; it can process 1,120 tons a day, or 25 percent of Rio's garbage. Battalions of soldiers are to blanket streets to discourage pickpockets.</p>
        <p>Completing what one Sao Paulo newspaper called "plastic surgery," the state-run Banco do Brasil Foundation unexpectedly announced two weeks ago that it was making a $750,000 grant to provide dormitories and soup kitchens for the hundreds of children who sleep on the sidewalk.</p>
        <p>Getting a head start on the problems of homelessness, the city government began a program in February called "Going Home": homeless migrant families are given new clothes, a small stipend for six months and one-way bus tickets home.</p>
        <p>"I am not taking the street children off the streets just so the visitors won't see them," said Leonel Brizola, governor of the state. To explain this policy, the state is printing brochures in English, French, German and Portuguese.</p>
