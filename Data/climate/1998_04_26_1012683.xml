        <p>The European operations of Ford and General Motors are supporting a plan by European auto makers to raise the average fuel economy of cars sold in Europe by nearly 20 percent, to 39 miles per gallon, even as the North American operations of both auto makers resist pressures to improve the far worse fuel economy of family vehicles here.</p>
        <p>The split within the world's two largest auto makers reflects two factors: gasoline taxes and global warming. Fuel economy is more important to car buyers overseas because gasoline in most industrialized nations can cost four times as much as in the United States because of higher taxes.

        <p>The European operations of Ford and General Motors are supporting a plan by European auto makers to raise the average fuel economy of cars sold in Europe by nearly 20 percent, to 39 miles per gallon, even as the North American operations of both auto makers resist pressures to improve the far worse fuel economy of family vehicles here.</p>
        <p>The split within the world's two largest auto makers reflects two factors: gasoline taxes and global warming. Fuel economy is more important to car buyers overseas because gasoline in most industrialized nations can cost four times as much as in the United States because of higher taxes. Pressure from environmental regulators to reduce the consumption of gasoline and slow emissions of gases that contribute to global warming is also greater across the Atlantic than in the United States.</p>
        <p>The European Automobile Manufacturers Association, which includes Ford of Europe and G.M.'s European subsidiaries, has offered to raise the average fuel economy of new cars sold in Europe to the equivalent of 39 miles per gallon of gasoline within 10 years, from 33 miles per gallon now.</p>
        <p>The details of the offer -- including whether the standard should apply to Europe's small but growing fleet of minivans and sport utility vehicles -- are being worked out by the auto makers with European Union officials, who have expressed an interest in even higher fuel-economy standards.</p>
        <p>''If we were not acting, probably we would be confronted with regulatory measures that may be worse for us,'' said Camille Blum, the secretary general of the European auto makers' trade group.</p>
        <p>Auto makers hope to meet the tough rules by using more lightweight but costly materials like aluminum, and by building smaller cars.</p>
        <p>By contrast, American regulations require each manufacturer to produce cars with an average fuel economy of 27.5 miles per gallon. The requirement for light trucks, a category including pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and minivans, is 20.7 miles per gallon. The overall fuel economy of new vehicles in the United States has actually been falling as light truck sales rise while car sales dwindle.</p>
        <p>Some lawmakers and environmentalists are beginning to look at events in Europe and ask why fuel economy is so much lower in this country.</p>
        <p>''If they're prepared to do the voluntary standards in Europe, what will they be willing to do in the United States?'' asked Senator Richard H. Bryan, Democrat of Nevada.</p>
        <p>So far, auto makers are reluctant to do anything different in the United States. Detroit's Big Three -- the Ford Motor Company, the General Motors Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation -- make virtually all of their profits on the biggest sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, which have the worst fuel economy of all.</p>
        <p>The three companies have lobbied strenuously and successfully against any increase in either the car or light truck gas mileage standards in the United States. The auto makers, meanwhile, are conducting research into electric vehicles and other technologies that may someday produce dramatic gains in fuel economy but will probably provide little if any benefit in the next few years.</p>
        <p>Auto executives argue that as long as gasoline sells for $1 a gallon in the United States, few buyers will demand more fuel-efficient cars. Sales of small cars, which are the most fuel efficient, dropped 8 percent in the United States last year from 1995, to 3.4 million, even as sales of full-sized sport utility vehicles and pickups rose 17 percent, to 2.4 million.</p>
