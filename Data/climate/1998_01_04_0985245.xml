        <p>Twenty-five years after the last Apollo astronaut left the Moon, a small unmanned spacecraft is ready to embark on a return trip, the first mission since then designed expressly for lunar exploration. One of its priorities is to answer the question, Is there water on the Moon?</p>
        <p>The 660-pound cylindrical spacecraft, Lunar Prospector, is scheduled for launching at 8:31 P.M. on Monday at Cape Canaveral, Fla. After a journey of four and a half days, the craft should swing into a lunar orbit on Saturday and begin 18 months of gathering data on the Moon's structure, composition and potentially useful resources for future interplanetary exploration.</p>
        <p>The objective of the relatively inexpensive $63 million mission is to circle the Moon at an altitude of 62 miles in an orbit crossing the poles. Previous missions concentrated on narrow equatorial orbits, which left about three-quarters of the surface geology inadequately mapped. Now scientists expect to survey the entire lunar surface in detail for the first time.</p>
        <p>''If successful, we will have detailed global maps of the Moon for the first time,'' Dr. Alan B. Binder, the mission's principal scientific investigator, said. ''We should know whether there is or is not water ice at the poles. We should understand more about the Moon's interior, its magnetic and gravity fields and its mineral resources.''</p>
        <p>Compared with the hundreds of millions of miles covered by missions to Mars and far beyond, the spacecraft's journey to the Moon, 240,000 miles away, is like an offshore excursion. But after the last visit by astronauts, on Apollo 17 in December 1972, the Moon lost its allure and was abandoned as a destination, except as an afterthought for two missions developed for other purposes.</p>
        <p>The Galileo spacecraft made some observations in 1991 as it flew by the Moon on its way to Jupiter. In 1994, a small spacecraft launched by the Defense Department to test space anti-missile technology was sent into lunar orbit for two months of photography and other observations. But its 250-mile altitude and scientific instruments were not ideal for lunar studies.</p>
        <p>Still, the Defense Department spacecraft, Clementine, whetted appetites for lunar exploration when its radar instrument suggested the possible presence of water ice in permanently shaded craters near the Moon's poles, presumably deposited when comets and meteorites struck. This encouraged thinking about the Moon as a site for human colonies and fueling stations for interplanetary travel. Hydrogen extracted from lunar water could be used as rocket fuel.</p>
        <p>''It's a hotly debated finding,'' Dr. Binder said of the putative water detection. ''Other radar systems do not find support for the Clementine claims. Most of us feel that it's not a valid measurement.''</p>
        <p>One of Lunar Prospector's five scientific instruments, a neutron spectrometer, is expected to provide a definitive answer to the water question. The spectrometer is designed to detect neutrons that escape the lunar surface as a result of cosmic-ray bombardment. Neutrons that have interacted with hydrogen, the principal component of water, should have distinctive energy levels.</p>
        <p>''If the water is there, within a meter of the surface, we'll see it,'' said Dr. William C. Feldman, a physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. ''We'll see a signature that has no other interpretation,'' said Dr. Feldman, who is in charge of the neutron spectrometer research.</p>
        <p>Scientists said the presence of significant amounts of lunar water ice should be detectable within a few days. But if there is no water, scientists will need to repeat measurements for months to be sure.</p>
        <p>The spacecraft carries two other instruments developed by the Los Alamos laboratory. One is a gamma ray spectrometer to map amounts of many chemical elements in the lunar crust. Its measurements should help scientists understand the Moon's origin and evolution and may also tell future explorers where to find useful metals like aluminum, iron, uranium and titanium. The Apollo missions conducted a similar survey, but only in the equatorial regions.</p>
        <p>The other instrument, an alpha particle spectrometer, is designed to look for evidence of nitrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide gases venting from the lunar interior. Compared with Earth or Mars, the Moon is an inactive body, but minor moonquakes sometimes occur to release such gases, which could also be valuable resources for lunar bases.</p>
        <p>Because lunar tremors are rare events, however, Dr. Feldman said that it was difficult to say when or if the instrument will obtain any telling data. ''You've got to be in the right place at the right time to see outgassing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Two other instruments, a magnetometer and an electron reflectometer, will be used to determine whether the weak lunar magnetic fields are caused by surface phenomena or by the Moon's core. An analysis of radio signals to and from the spacecraft should enable scientists to chart variations in the Moon's gravity, which indicate anomalies in the crustal mass and a crust that is thicker on the far side of the Moon than on the side always facing Earth.</p>
        <p>If Lunar Prospector is still functioning normally at the end of a year, it will be maneuvered to descend to altitudes of only six miles for an even closer inspection of lunar geology. That phase is expected to last six months, after which the craft will eventually crash into the Moon.</p>
        <p>The mission is being directed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif. The spacecraft was built by the Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space division of the Lockheed Martin Corporation. The concept for the mission and the craft was developed by Dr. Binder, director of the Lunar Research Institute in Gilroy, Calif., who was a scientist for the Viking landings on Mars in the 1970's.</p>
