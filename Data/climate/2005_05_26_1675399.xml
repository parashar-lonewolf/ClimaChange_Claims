        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Climate Signals'' (editorial, May 19), about President Bush and global climate change:</p>
        <p>Under the president's direction, our government has taken a global leadership role in developing technologies to reduce emissions. America has the largest carbon sequestration program in the world, and in 2003 we founded the international Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum.</p>
        <p>We are working to develop zero-emission power plants through the $1 billion FutureGen program; we are investing $2 billion in ''clean coal'' technologies; we are working to create incentives for the construction of more clean, safe and reliable nuclear power plants; and the United States has tripled wind power generation since 2000.</p>
        <p>The comments made by Jeffrey Immelt, the chief executive of General Electric, regarding G.E.'s investment in environmentally friendly technologies are further proof that the free-market approach advocated by the president works. If given the opportunity, companies will invest in such technologies because, as Mr. Immelt says, ''green is green.''</p>
        <p>The president's opponents have called him a lot of things, but ''passive'' with regard to climate change is certainly not accurate.</p>
        <p>Samuel W. Bodman  Secretary of Energy  Washington, May 19, 2005</p>
