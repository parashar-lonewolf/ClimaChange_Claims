        <p>The tiny South Pacific country of Tuvalu, despite being strung with so few phone lines that international callers hear busy signals more often than voices, has buttressed its economy with cash from the Internet. And to celebrate, Tuvalu (pronounced too-vah-LOO) is using a more traditional network: the postal service.</p>
        <p>The Philatelic Bureau of Tuvalu announced last week that it would issue two stamps to commemorate its business partnership with an American company, the .tv Corporation.</p>
        <p>The country, a chain of islands midway between Hawaii and Australia with only 10,600 people and 16 square miles of dry land, has received nearly $20 million from the .tv Corporation, an Internet company based in Los Angeles. And the nation is scheduled to receive at least $4 million a year -- half its gross domestic product -- for 12 years. In exchange, the .tv Corporation gains control over something that is unique to Tuvalu: its .tv Internet domain.</p>
        <p>Every nation is assigned a country code domain extension -- the suffix that ends an Internet address. The United States has .us, for example. Tuvalu's is .tv, which the .tv Corporation says it has used to sell more than 200,000 Internet addresses. The Economist, for example, bought www.economist.tv to stream news video clips over the Web.</p>
        <p>For Tuvalu, whose residents make their living mostly through fishing, the business partnership has provided a needed cash infusion. New generators brought electricity to the outer islands, work began to pave the country's dirt roads and extend its only airstrip, and the country applied for admission to the United Nations. Tuvalu became the U.N.'s 189th member last September.</p>
        <p>The commemorative stamps blend Tuvalu's traditions with the technology that brought the country into the international community, according to  Marica Seluka, marketing manager of the Philatelic Bureau. One features a smiling woman with a red flower in her hair, the other a man blowing into a sea shell. In each, a satellite dish rises behind a logo for the .tv Corporation.</p>
        <p>Tuvalu's government paid $3 million last fall for a 20 percent stake in the .tv Corporation, which is privately held. But with the bursting of the Internet bubble, common-word domain names like drugs.com or drugstore.com no longer bring the six-figure prices they once did. Nevertheless, the company's chief executive, Lou Kerner, said he expected the .tv Corporation to have a positive flow as domain renewals increased.</p>
        <p>With its highest peak only 15 feet above sea level, Tuvalu is vulnerable to flooding caused by global warming. But with its fortunes so tied to the .tv Corporation, the country may have as much to fear from the receding Internet tide.</p>
