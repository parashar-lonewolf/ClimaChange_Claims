        <p>A tree known as Methuselah, famed as the oldest in the world, has just produced evidence that life begins at 5,000, give or take a few years.</p>
        <p>Today that evidence -- a dozen baby bristlecone pine trees -- are about nine inches long with green, bushy tops and long healthy roots.</p>
        <p>A mere sprout itself when the pyramids of Egypt were being built, Methuselah clings to a dry windswept mountaintop in the Inyo National Forest of east-central California.</p>
        <p>Last fall, there in the White Mountains, nearly two miles above sea level, a tree farmer named Jared Milarch harvested cuttings and pine cones from Methuselah with special permission from the United States Forest Service, which normally keeps the tree's location secret. After failing in an attempt to clone the tree, he planted seeds from the cones in a growing medium and, much to everyone's surprise, they sprouted.</p>
        <p>Next month, a ceremony is being planned to recognize the new offspring, and one will be presented to the United States Botanic Garden on the grounds of the Capitol.</p>
        <p>Experts are unsure whether Methuselah has borne any offspring in its native setting, a 28,000-acre preserve called the Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest. Very few seeds of the eerie small trees, some sculptured by the wind into fantastic bows and knots and waves, survive in that harsh environment. But with the help of humans, Methuselah is known to have reproduced itself at least one other time, in the 1970's.</p>
        <p>''It had a 100 percent germination rate,'' said Le Roy Johnson, former director of the Institute of Tree Genetics in Placerville, Calif., who led the earlier effort. ''That's more than we get on most trees, let alone the oldest tree in the world.'' Animals and plants lose their ability to reproduce as they age.</p>
        <p>Bristlecone pines seem ''capable of growing forever'' in the mountains, Mr. Johnson said.</p>
        <p>The baby Methuselah will have tight security when it is exhibited at the Botanic Garden this fall, for fear of theft, said the garden's executive director, Holly Shimizu. ''These pines are very famous,'' she said. ''We have all read about Methuselah and heard about it, but so few people actually get to see it.''</p>
        <p>When it was shown to the public for the first time in Virginia recently, people lined up to be photographed with it, said Mr. Milarch, co-founder of the Champion Tree Project, a group dedicated to cloning the champions of America's 800-plus tree species for reforestation.</p>
        <p>Bristlecone pines have both male and female cones and can self-pollinate, but when that occurs, the offspring are usually faulty. Most likely, the father was a neighbor whose pollen was carried by the wind or an insect. Genetic tests will confirm the seedling's lineage.</p>
        <p>''The scientific value of one specimen like this is small,'' said Christine Flanagan, public program director at the Botanic Garden, but it can be ''a signpost for other studies.''</p>
        <p>By taking samples from the young seedlings, researchers will be able to look for genetic changes associated with that environment that might account for the tree's great age, she said.</p>
        <p>In trees, unlike in humans, stress fosters longevity. Methuselah grows in rocky, alkaline, nutrient-poor soil and is buried under snow most of the year and blasted by sun and parched for water for the rest. It has a growing season of just two months in the summer to produce and store food for the winter. Yet bristlecones have thrived in that spot for 11,000 years, tree ring analysis shows.</p>
        <p>They retain their bottlebrush needles up to 40 years, four times as long as other pines, so they need fewer nutrients each year for new growth. Also, their living tissue is just a strip, in Methuselah's case, one inch thick and six wide. Their trunks start dying around 1,000 years. What's left, their crowns and the strip of vascular tissue, grows extremely slowly -- one-hundredth of an inch in a good year, said Mr. Johnson, and often less. Giant sequoias, some of them 2,000 years old, grow an inch in diameter in a good year.</p>
        <p>Experts think the shrinking of bristlecones' live tissue is a strategy to balance growth with available nutrients. But it may contribute to their longevity in another way as well: bristlecones that grow faster in lusher conditions are more susceptible to pathogens, said Tom Harlan, a dendrochronologist who is a consultant to the University of Arizona's Laboratory of Tree Ring Research. The laboratory's senior scientist, Dr. Edmund Schulman, discovered Methuselah in 1957 and estimated its age at about 4,600 years. (The current Forest Service estimate is 4,733.)</p>
        <p>Only abrupt climate change and pathogens attacking exposed roots kill ancient bristlecones, said John Louth, Forest Service manager of their preserve. For example, the seedlings of Methuselah propagated in the 1970's all died when passed out to arboretums at sea level.</p>
        <p>Methuselah's new sprout will not survive in Washington, predicted the National Arboretum's director, Dr. Thomas Elias. ''If the aim is to establish it in an arboretum, high-altitude ones like Denver are more suitable,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As for Methuselah, it may need its new status as world's oldest mother to hang on to its place in the record books. Researchers are looking right now in the mountains of China and Russia for older trees. And in fact, researchers connected with the Arizona lab say that a recent analysis of a tree boring collected years ago by Dr. Schulman indicates that one of Methuselah's neighbors is even older. But out of concern for that tree's safety, they are not disclosing anything more about it.</p>
