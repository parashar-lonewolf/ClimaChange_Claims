        <p>Bill Clinton's speech commemorating Earth Day later this week might answer some questions. Does he really care about the environment or was that just something he told the voters? And is he paying any attention at all to his Vice President?</p>
        <p>Things have not been going Al Gore's way. Months ago, he had every reason to believe that Bill Clinton would become the "environment President" George Bush pledged to be but wasn't. And that he, as the President's political conscience and policy coordinator, would steer the onetime friend of polluters in the Arkansas chicken industry to new heights of global stewardship.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has hardly been heard from on environmental issues since Inauguration Day. The White House has been doing most of the talking, and not in a way that pleases the Vice President.</p>
        <p>First it approved a toxic waste incinerator in Ohio that Mr. Gore had pledged to keep closed pending further study. Then it withdrew its support for sensible proposals on mining and grazing offered by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt. Mr. Gore had no personal stake in these proposals but his sensitivities must surely have been wounded by Mr. Clinton's quick capitulation to powerful interests.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has a big investment in the issues Mr. Clinton is supposed to address tomorrow, particularly global warming. He knows and cares more about that subject than any other politician in Washington. In his best-selling "Earth in the Balance" he described global warming as "the most serious threat that we have ever faced," and urged the world to act "boldly, decisively, comprehensively and quickly."</p>
        <p>At a minimum, Mr. Gore would commit the U.S. to stabilizing annual emissions of so-called greenhouse gases, chiefly carbon dioxide, at 1990 levels by the year 2000. This was the original goal of many of the nations gathered at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro last year. President Bush -- citing, among other things, scientific uncertainty and economic costs -- single-handedly engineered a weaker treaty that set no timetables or targets. Mr. Clinton pounced upon this in the campaign and pledged to support the original Rio goal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore wants Mr. Clinton to fulfill that pledge, made when there were just the two of them riding the bus to the White House. The bus is more crowded now.</p>
        <p>Treasury Secretary LLoyd Bentsen and Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary resist Mr. Gore's plan. Neither is an unbiased witness; Mr. Bentsen has historically been tender toward business in general and oil in particular, and Ms. O'Leary's last job was as executive vice president of a power company. Both want more study of the impact of diminished energy use on American industry.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore argues that efficiency, conservation and new technologies can limit greenhouse gases without economic disruption. On the face of it, that seems glib, and he cannot expect Mr. Clinton to adopt his strategy without answering tough questions about costs and competing strategies. How much can be achieved through energy efficiency? Will a big carbon tax be required on top of Mr. Clinton's proposed energy taxes? And how much assistance will developing countries need to persuade them to limit energy use without sabotaging economic growth?</p>
        <p>But this is not just about details. This is about the broad pathway the Administration intends to follow. What we're hearing from Mr. Bentsen and Ms. O'Leary is a lot like what we heard from George Bush, who shrank from leadership and found fearsome risks and reasons for delay everywhere, whether the issue was global warming or biodiversity or the spotted owl.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton did not sign on to all of Al Gore's environmental policies when he chose his running mate. But he left the firm impression that he intended to confront environmental problems and educate the American people to their complexities. If he now follows the kinds of instincts that governed him in Arkansas and shuns Mr. Gore's advice, he will have put the Vice President in his place. But that's not the place Al Gore ought to be, which is guiding the President and the Cabinet on issues he knows better than any of them.</p>
