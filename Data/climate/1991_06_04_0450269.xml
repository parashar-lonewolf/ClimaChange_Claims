        <p>By Washington standards, the National Science Foundation is one of many small Government organizations relegated to the back of budget books as "other independent agencies."</p>
        <p>Although it is dwarfed in size and budget even by companion technical agencies, like the National Institutes of Health and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Science Foundation is in a period of extraordinary growth.</p>
        <p>And to Dr. Walter E. Massey, beginning a six-year term as director of the foundation, its size belies its growing influence.</p>
        <p>The foundation, which has a $2.3 billion budget this year, has taken a major role in big interagency programs to study global climate change, to develop high-performance computer technology, and to sponsor research to improve industrial competitiveness to improve science and mathematics education and literacy, he said. And he said the agency is expanding its role as the major Federal sponsor of nonmedical basic research at colleges and universities.</p>
        <p>"The N.S.F. is establishing a bigger presence in Washington and will play a significant role in some major undertakings," said Dr. Massey, a physicist who was vice president for research at the University of Chicago until he took his new job on March 4. Seeking to Double Budget</p>
        <p>President Bush has continued an initiative begun by the Reagan Administration in 1987 to double the foundation's budget, then $1.6 billion, over five years. Congress did not appropriate all of the annual money requests. But the foundation, which frequently received budget increases of 15 percent or more while other agencies had to settle for the same money or less, expects to reach the goal of $3.2 billion in 1994.</p>
        <p>The political priority given the agency, which annually awards 13,000 to 15,000 research grants in all fields of natural and social science and engineering, stems from the belief that research is the basis of future economic growth.</p>
        <p>Dr. Massey, 52 years old, took over after the controversial term of Erich Bloch, an engineer and former International Business Machines Corporation executive who changed the course of the agency. Mr. Bloch, whose frank and sometimes confrontational style alienated some scientists as well as some people at the foundation, pushed to increase the agency's budget. In addition, he gave more emphasis to applied technology research, which would have a more immediate economic payoff for the country than the basic research the foundation had historically sponsored.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bloch started an ambitious program of creating research centers that would combine the resources of universities, industry and government to advance key technologies. The centers, collaborative projects in which participants from different institutions share knowledge and equipment, were opposed by some scientists who felt they drained money from existing research.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Massey said he supported the centers program, which includes 25 science and technology centers, 19 engineering research centers, 9 materials research laboratories, 5 national supercomputer centers and 41 smaller industry-university cooperative research centers.</p>
        <p>The science and technology centers, for instance, are multimillion-dollar projects that have been designed to study things like tiny semiconductors that might be used in future computer circuits, the way microbes affect hazardous waste disposal and better mathematical models for predicting weather.  Grants to Individuals</p>
        <p>"We will continue the efforts begun by Erich Bloch," said Dr. Massey, who is known for a more congenial management style than his predecessor. "I think the direction in which the agency is now heading is a proper one." One area that will get more attention, he said, is increasing the size of grants to individual scientists. The average foundation grant is now about $55,000, which critics say is hardly enough to support a researcher and even one graduate student assistant.</p>
        <p>Dr. Massey, formerly director of the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois and professor of physics and dean at Brown University, was no stranger to Washington or the foundation before his appointment as director. Well known in science policy circles, he was a member of the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology, a group formed to advise President Bush on scientific issues. He had also served on the National Science Board, the science foundation's governing body, and on numerous Federal scientific boards and commissions.</p>
        <p>A graduate of Morehouse College in Atlanta, Dr. Massey received his M.S. and Ph.D degrees in physics from Washington University in St. Louis.  Dr. Massey's personal research has been in methods of calculating the low-temperature properties of strongly interacting fluids.</p>
        <p>Dr. Massey has long been a supporter and originator of science education programs designed to get more young pupils, particularly members of minority groups and girls, interested in science careers. While at Brown University, for instance, Dr. Massey founded and directed a program to educate science teachers for inner-city schools. "The N.S.F., which has science education as one of its major goals, has done fairly well lately in this area and this is certainly something I will emphasize," he said.</p>
