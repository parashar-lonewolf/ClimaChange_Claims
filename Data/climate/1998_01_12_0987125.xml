        <p>Pulsing beside a web of underground pipelines snaking out of Tulsa, Okla., one of the more intriguing second acts in the telecommunications industry is about to begin.</p>
        <p>Call it Wiltel: the Sequel. A bit overshadowed by $16 billion worth of telecommunications takeover agreements last week, the Williams Companies announced its return to the national communications business with an 11,000-mile fiber optic network and $1 billion in contracts.</p>
        <p>In the category of second acts, the return of the AT&amp;T Corporation to the local telephone business after announcing an agreement to acquire Teleport Communications Group Inc. for $11.3 billion in stock is more glamorous.</p>
        <p>But even after completing its Teleport buyout, AT&amp;T will still not resemble a big local telephone carrier. Williams, meanwhile, wants to expand beyond its status as the nation's largest operator of natural gas pipelines. It is bidding to become one of the country's main providers of wholesale high-speed communications services, capitalizing on the practically insatiable appetite for advanced networks that can carry voice, video and data traffic.</p>
        <p>It will not be its first foray into the business.</p>
        <p>Three years and one week ago, Williams sold almost its entire national network, known as Wiltel, to a little-known long-distance company called LDDS Communications Inc. for $2.5 billion.</p>
        <p>The chief executive of LDDS was a virtually unknown former basketball coach named Bernard J. Ebbers, and after buying Wiltel he renamed the company Worldcom Inc.</p>
        <p>These days, of course, Mr. Ebbers stalks bigger game. Worldcom agreed last year to acquire the MCI Communications Corporation, the No. 2 long-distance carrier, for about $36 billion.</p>
        <p>Part of the Williams deal with Mr. Ebbers was that the company would not compete against Worldcom for three years in selling many kinds of telecommunications services.</p>
        <p>The company was left with basically two sorts of communications businesses, neither of them as potentially lucrative as selling wholesale telecommunications services. Since 1995, Williams has been transmitting sports events from arenas to network production studios and has been installing and servicing communications systems within corporations and other enterprises.</p>
        <p>The noncompetition agreement expired last Monday. But while Williams was silent for three years, it did not sit on its hands. Instead, the company began to rebuild the same sort of network it sold in 1995, only this time using more advanced communications technology and more experience.</p>
        <p>''In 1984, when we started we had five people who had come out of our pipelines,'' Keith E. Bailey, the chairman of Williams, said in an interview last week. ''We're going to where we go today with a communications organization that has 8,000 people in it, and that is growing. We've retained the institutional and organizational capabilities and the resources we need to go forward.''</p>
        <p>A potential problem is that where Williams wants to go today is a fairly popular place, and it is getting crowded. There are at least two other new national fiber optic networks under construction -- one a $1.4 billion system being built by Qwest Communications International Inc., a unit of the Anschutz Corporation, the other an effort worth more than $500 million from IXC Communications Inc.</p>
        <p>The established national network players -- AT&amp;T, MCI, Sprint and Worldcom -- continue in the meantime to invest billions to upgrade their systems.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bailey said Williams planned to spend about $750 million by 1999, bringing the total value of its network to about $1 billion.</p>
        <p>Williams has competition, but it also has contracts. The company has deals worth about $1 billion over the next 20 years with U S West, Intermedia Communications and Concentric Network.</p>
        <p>The cornerstone of that group is U S West. Williams is hoping that U S West will win entry into the long-distance telephone market and use Williams as its primary national network provider. But that may not happen any time soon.</p>
        <p>Wall Street analysts who follow Williams think the company can pull off its ambitious plan but advise patience.</p>
        <p>''What you have is bunch of pipeline guys running a telecommunications business,'' said John E. Olson, an analyst for Merrill Lynch &amp; Company. ''I saw them take this thing from a $25-million-a-year loss leader to something that was earning $165 million a year. But Wiltel made very skinny profits for the first 8 years or 10 years of life, then it really took off. Does that tell us anything about the current plans?''</p>
        <p>The company estimates that its overall communications business generates about $1.4 billion in sales each year. That would be less than half of the company's overall revenue of $3.5 billion in 1996, the last full year for which the company has reported financial results. The company's core business remains moving natural gas, not information.</p>
        <p>''This is really an energy company with a telecommunications kicker,'' Mr. Olson said. ''The irony is that the tail is wagging the dog right now. The stock went up 51 percent last year, while the earnings went down slightly on an operating basis. The market has sensed a great opportunity in Williams stock as a cheap way to play the telecommunications business, as opposed to the alternatives, who are trading in the ozone layer.''</p>
        <p>Shares of Williams surged to a 52-week high of $29.6875 last Monday after the company announced its plans, but they pulled back later in the week, closing at $26.9375 on Friday, down 37.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>But the real question facing the Williams communications operation is not how much management attention it receives but whether the nation needs another high-speed communications network. For the last few years, the telecommunications industry has operated by a successful motto: build the network and the customers will come. But few analysts believe that can work forever.</p>
        <p>''As the capacity came in and as the price point went down, the demand went up dramatically,'' Mr. Bailey said, recalling the 1980's and early 1990's. ''We have some of the same discussion today. While that can't be denied as a risk, my sense is that, having lived through this industry for more than a decade, if we're making mistakes we're probably underestimating demand growth again.''</p>
        <p>If he is right, his company will have little to worry about.</p>
