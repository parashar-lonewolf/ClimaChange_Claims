        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The article on the state's energy conservation program (''Trying to Save Energy May Come at a Price'') on June 16 only scratched the surface of what could be a ground-breaking opportunity for New Jersey to provide leadership in significantly improving our global energy and environmental conditions, or just another dismal frittering away of millions of dollars with little or no beneficial sustainable results.</p>
        <p>As the article notes, the Davies Report, commissioned by the state Board of Public Utilities, cites the lack of a long-range plan for achieving measurable results in what it calls ''energy market transformation'' efforts. However, what is needed first is a step back to ensure that there is a clear understanding and acceptance of key objectives and that the programs being planned and implemented are consistent with achieving those objectives.</p>
        <p>The objectives explicitly or implicitly in the landmark legislation are: reducing energy use (conservation) without impairing the standard of living of our citizens; increasing the supply of energy to keep up with demand, with emphasis on environmentally friendly alternative sources; replacing environmentally destructive fossil fuels with renewable energy sources like solar and wind; and maintaining a reasonable cap on energy costs.</p>
        <p>While some of these objectives are reflected in the evolving programs to date, priority has not been given to supporting the most productive means for achieving all or most of them.</p>
        <p>Instead, the board appears to have been diverted by inside maneuvering of the various vested interests on the one hand and the inevitable bureaucratic inertia on the other plus the uncertainty of the transition process resulting from last November's election.</p>
        <p>As one example, the board, in late December, issued a belated request for proposals ''to develop renewable energy technology projects'' to be submitted by the beginning of February. The board has allocated $10 million to the program's first year. Decisions on the proposals were promised by April 3.</p>
        <p>Fourteen proposals were submitted by the deadline, including one for a solar energy project from me and my group, Hoburn Management Corporation. Our proposal is initially in the form of a one-megawatt capacity demonstration project that can be replicated throughout the state to, we believe, create a generating capacity of up to 100 megawatts, comparable to a midsized fossil-fuel fired plant, and with none of the pollution consequences. We and the other proposers are still waiting for a decision, which now seems to be postponed indefinitely.</p>
        <p>The major impediment today to the more pervasive use of solar power is the high, up-front investment required of users. Payback times of around 15 years or more are still not sufficient to attract owners except, perhaps, for the most ''green'' motivated.</p>
        <p>So far, promotional efforts of the solar industry and government have focused on the individual user. The solution to achieving more widespread use of solar power in New Jersey is to encourage and support the development of innovative solar power aggregators who will bear the initial financial burden and supply electricity to both the ultimate users directly and to the utilities by feeding excess electricity generated into the electricity grid.</p>
        <p>New Jersey can jump-start the process by taking the initiative in providing sufficient financing to help create a critical mass leading to economies of scale -- and the creation of hundreds of new jobs, including the attraction of solar equipment manufacturers to the state. New Jersey can become the first truly solar state in the country.</p>
