        <p>LEAD: President Bush's plan to reduce acid rain by limiting pollutants from the smokestacks of electric utility plants is drawing criticism from some of the nation's cleanest utilities as well as the dirtiest.</p>
        <p>President Bush's plan to reduce acid rain by limiting pollutants from the smokestacks of electric utility plants is drawing criticism from some of the nation's cleanest utilities as well as the dirtiest.</p>
        <p>Those that burn natural gas and low-sulfur oil instead of high-sulfur coal are complaining because the Bush proposal would require them to cut pollution from existing plants if they want to build new ones. This, they say, is nearly impossible because there is little room left for improvement.</p>
        <p>Utilities that use oil argue that the companies that use coal can easily clean up older plants because coal is so dirty to begin with. The oil-burning utilities also say the bill does not recognize their costly efforts, mostly to control sulfur dioxide, a pollutant released into the air when the sulfur in coal or oil is burned.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists are skeptical of all these arguments. ''This is another in a series of very creative excuses utilities have come up with,'' said Constance M. Mahan of the National Audubon Society.</p>
        <p>''They're dirtier now because the law permitted them to buy cheaper and dirtier fuel, and that's what they're doing,'' said David G. Hawkins, a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council and a former assistant administrator for air programs at the Environmental Protection Agency. ''They're trying to do the classic thing polluting firms have always tried to do: maximize their permission to pollute.'' Objections From the Northeast</p>
        <p>A related objection has been raised by some coal-burning utilities that have already cleaned up. For example, utilities in Wisconsin, under a 1985 law, have already cut their emissions below the level that Washington now proposes, and complain that they would be in a better position today if they had not cleaned up four years ago. And utilities that have not cleaned up are complaining that it would be very costly for them to do so.</p>
        <p>Combined with those objections, the the objections of the oil- and gas-burners in the Northeast may make the President's proposed amendments to the Clean Air Act more difficult to get through Congress.</p>
        <p>One of those objections by the Northeastern utilities is that the President's proposal would require electric companies that already meet the new standard to match the level of emissions they achieved in 1985. At that time, the utilities could buy abundant natural gas at low prices, resulting in very low pollution. Most have shifted back to oil, because of price changes and higher electric demand.</p>
        <p>''It's arbitrary, and we're being unfairly penalized,'' said Frank M. Lee, manager of environmental affairs at the Boston Edison Company, complaining about the selection of 1985 as the base year. He added that his company could do little more to clean up, because it is already buying low-sulfur oil, as Massachusetts requires.</p>
        <p>''If acid rain is a problem, our customers have already paid the price for clean air,'' he said. ''We've already paid our dues.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Hawkins of the Resources Defense Council counters: ''If you start handing out allowances to people who burn gas, where do you draw the line?''</p>
        <p>At Northeast Utilities, which serves most of Connecticut and part of Massachusetts, Emmanuel S. Forde, a spokesman, said the company was already using fuel with a sulfur content so low that if it had to make further efforts to clean up in order to expand, ''you might have to find a fuel with minus quantities of sulfur.'' Many States Have Rules</p>
        <p>Most East Coast states have rules that have already accomplished the kind of cleanup that Mr. Bush proposes for utilities in the Midwest that use high-sulfur coal. For many years, New York and Connecticut, for example, have required many generators to use oil with a sulfur content no higher than five-tenths of 1 percent, although cheaper oil with a sulfur content of 2.4 percent is available. In oil, a sulfur content of 1 percent yields 1.2 pounds of sulfur dioxide per one million B.T.U.'s of heat produced, the level that the Bush proposal sets for coal plants in the Midwest.</p>
        <p>The Bush proposal is stated in terms of sulfur dioxide output for a given amount of heat produced, regardless of the fuel used. The quantity of heat used as a standard is one million B.T.U.'s, or British thermal units. A B.T.U. is the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of a pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. One million B.T.U.'s of heat can run a turbine to produce 100 kilowatt-hours of electricity.</p>
        <p>The proposal retricts emissions of sulfur dioxide to no more than 1.2 pounds per million B.T.U.'s used. If the utility already meets that standard, the maximum sulfur dioxide output is set at the level achieved by the utility in 1985.</p>
        <p>In New York, the Consolidated Edison Company, one of the cleanest fossil-fuel-burning utilities in the country, said in a statement that the proposal had ''dire implications for the social and economic prospects of New York City and Westchester,'' its service area. The reason, the company said, is that it burned an extraordinarily large proportion of gas in 1985, and would have difficulty reaching that level again. If it wants to add plants, it said, it would have to make existing plants cleaner still.</p>
        <p>In 1985, Con Edison's system average was 0.15 pound of sulfur dioxide per million B.T.U.'s; last year, because high demand required burning more oil, the average was 0.19 pound.</p>
