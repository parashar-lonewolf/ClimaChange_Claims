        <p>IF global warming proceeds as forecast, it could cause the Northern Hemisphere's ice sheets to expand much as they did at the start of the last Ice Age, when the world's climate was slightly warmer than it is today, American and Canadian scientists say.</p>
        <p>That possibility may seem to go against common sense. But the scientists say the conditions that led to the last great glaciation could materialize again if the global climate warms significantly in the next few decades.</p>
        <p>Mathematical models of the world's climate indicate that the average global temperature will rise 3 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit in the next century from the current level of 60 degrees if humans continue to pour heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide into the air at the current pace. Recreating a Glaciation</p>
        <p>The researchers, Dr. Gifford Miller of the University of Colorado and Dr. Anne de Vernal of the University of Quebec at Montreal, reconstructed conditions at the start of the last glaciation. The glaciation began about 122,000 years ago and reached its maximum extent in North America when the Laurentide ice sheet advanced as far south as Long Island and past Chicago 18,000 years ago.</p>
        <p>Analyzing data from a number of sources, including information on ancient temperatures and ice sheets preserved in lake and ocean sediments, the researchers determined that the ice sheets actually began growing near the end of the last interglacial, or warm period between glaciations, when the climate was a little warmer than it is now. The scientists concluded that the northern oceans were relatively warm and that summer temperatures were relatively low. Their report appears in the current issue of the British journal Nature.</p>
        <p>The warmer seas would have caused more water to evaporate, they say, producing the moisture for increased precipitation in the winter. It would have fallen as snow, the researchers said, and the cool summers would have allowed much of it to remain on the ground year-round.  The excess snow compressed into ice, millennium after millennium, and the ice accumulated and advanced southward.</p>
        <p>The world has been in an interglacial period for about 10,000 years. No earlier such period has lasted more than about 12,000 years, and scientists generally believe that this one is nearing its end.</p>
        <p>The next advance of the ice could be hastened, Dr. Miller and Dr. de Vernal concluded, if the mathematical models that forecast global warming are right. The models indicate that the warming will be most pronounced in far northern latitudes and in the winter.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the researchers said, solar radiation in the far north has been decreasing in the summertime for about the last 9,000 years as a result of long-term, periodic changes in the tilt, rotation and orbit of the earth. These alter the way in which sunlight strikes the planet, and scientists believe that this, in turn, alters the intensity of the seasons. Summer temperatures in far northern latitudes are no longer enough to melt all the snow that falls in the winter. Some Remain Skeptical</p>
        <p>In the decades ahead, Dr. Miller and Dr. de Vernal say, the combination of the drop in solar radiation and the warmer northern winters predicted by the models could lead once more to more snowfall in the winter and less melting in the summer. Consequently, they wrote, the possibility that increasing concentrations of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere might lead to the growth of ice sheets "cannot be lightly dismissed."</p>
        <p>Dr. John Imbrie of Brown University, an expert on ice ages, called the idea reasonable and plausible. But he said that there was still much to learn about the snow accumulation. For instance, he said, it is not known whether the warmer northern temperature would melt more snow than it produced. "You would have to understand the net effect" of a number of possibly competing factors, he said.</p>
        <p>Further, the evidence for a relationship between sea-surface temperatures and ice formation when the last glaciation began is "not quite so clear as one might want," said Dr. David Rind, a climate research scientist at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York.  The water was warm in the western Atlantic but cold in the Norwegian sea, he said, and "we don't know where the ice was when it started to grow."</p>
        <p>As for predictions of the intensity and regional variability of global warming, he said that the mathematical models on which the predictions are based are imprecise and risky.  "You would not bet the family jewels on them," he said.</p>
        <p>If the continental ice sheets were to begin expanding tomorrow, and if they behaved as have those in the past, it would be millennia before they approached the United States, Dr. Imbrie said. Although the ice of the last glaciation began accumulating about 122,000 years ago, he said, it took about 10,000 years for a substantial ice sheet to build up. As climatic conditions changed over succeeding millennia, the ice sheet advanced and retreated several times until reaching its maximum extent about 18,000 years ago.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Dr. Imbrie said, a global warming brought about by a buildup of heat-trapping gases would take place much more rapidly, in decades or centuries. The earth's climate could warm -- catastrophically, according to the direst predictions -- for a long time before the ice began to cool things down. A new ice age, Dr. Imbrie said, would not be the solution to a warming of the planet.</p>
