        <p>Anger Spreads in China After Chemical Spill  Efforts by local officials in Harbin, China, to hide a chemical spill that has left millions of people without running water, has incited public anger and dissatisfaction at a time when China is eager to prove to the world that it is a candid international partner on issues like containing avian influenza.A1</p>
        <p>Abbas Opens Gaza Border  Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, formally reopened the Gaza Strip's border crossing with Egypt, giving Palestinians control over one of their frontiers for the first time. Palestinians consider taking control of the Rafah crossing as an important step in both practical and symbolic terms in their quest for statehood.</p>

        <p>Syria Strikes Deal With U.N.  Syria, heading off a direct confrontation with the United Nations Security Council, has agreed to allow five officials to leave Damascus to be questioned in Vienna by the prosecutor investigating the assassination of the former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri.</p>

        <p>Iraqi Rebels Consider Politics  A senior aide to Iraq's president said that some insurgent groups had contacted him to ask about their joining in the American-backed political process. The general said that none of those who called him appeared to be among those still loyal to Saddam Hussein.</p>

        <p>Holocaust Skeptic Denied Bail  An Austrian judge denied a request for bail for the British historian David Irving, who is accused of violating the country's laws against denying the Holocaust. The ruling meant that Mr. Irving, whose eccentric and widely rejected views of Nazi history have gained him worldwide notoriety, will remain in prison while Austrian prosecutors prepare an indictment against him.</p>
        <p>A3</p>
        <p>Way Paved for Kosovo Talks  The United Nations sent its chief negotiator to the Balkans to meet with the leadership of Kosovo's two factions, taking a step closer to starting talks on the future of the province, perhaps the most intractable issue remaining from the Balkan wars of the 1990's.</p>

        <p>Coca an Issue in Bolivian Race  Evo Morales, the top presidential candidate in Bolivia's upcoming elections, has pledged to legalize coca, the main ingredient in cocaine, a worrisome development for the United States.</p>

        <p>Scandal Shakes Japan's Faith  In Japan, which sits atop four tectonic plates and is prone to earthquakes, the case of an architect caught cheating on earthquake building codes to save costs has transfixed the nation, striking at a core insecurity for many Japanese.</p>

        <p>Voters Nationwide Voice Discontent With President  In more than 75 interviews across the country many people who voted for President Bush a year ago had trouble pinning their current discontent on any one thing, helping to explain the slide in the president's approval and trustworthiness ratings in recent polls.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>G.O.P. Debating Tax Cuts  Republicans of all stripes want to cut taxes, but rarely have they been in so much disarray about whose taxes to cut. If House Republicans and President Bush have their way, more than half of tax reductions would go to the top 1 percent of households, but the Republican-controlled Senate has passed a bill that is devoted to shielding middle-income and upper-income families from the Alternative Minimum Tax.</p>
        <p>A11</p>
        <p>New Rules May Limit Research  American universities are warning that rules proposed by the Defense Department and expected soon from the Commerce Department could hurt research by limiting the ability of foreign-born students and technicians to work with sensitive technology in laboratories.</p>
        <p>A11</p>
        <p>Mardi Gras Outlook Seems Dim  The two weeks of Mardi Gras parades and parties have for decades been New Orleans's binding cord, but with planning for the February Carnival season now under way, Mardi Gras has been plagued by harsh financial realities, indecision, lowered expectations and the possibility that this year's parade lineup could be without some of its most popular social clubs.</p>
        <p>A9</p>
        <p>Amtrak Endures, With Limits  Congress was fairly generous with Amtrak in the transportation budget it passed just before it went home for Thanksgiving, but the package has some unusual strings attached, including a limit on Amtrak's ability to discount tickets and reduce the airline-style pricing that the railroad has been using.</p>

        <p>EDUCATION</p>
        <p>Test Results Not Adding Up  After Tennessee tested its eighth grade students in math this year, state officials announced that 87 percent of students performed at or above the proficiency level. But results of the federal government's tests were startlingly different: only 21 percent of Tennessee's eighth graders were considered proficient in math. Such discrepancies have intensified the national debate over testing and accountability.</p>

        <p>Iraq War Taking Toll on Minds  Military psychiatry has always been close to a contradiction in terms. But just how deep mental wounds are, and how many will be disabled by them, are matters of deepening controversy as the war in Iraq presents profound mental stresses: unknown and often unseen enemies, suicide bombers, a hostile land with virtually no safe zone.</p>

        <p>New York State Toughens Rules on Auto Emissions  New York is adopting California's ambitious new regulations aimed at cutting automotive emissions of global warming gases, touching off a battle over rules that would sharply reduce carbon dioxide emissions while forcing the auto industry to make vehicles more energy efficient over the next decade.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Panel to Study Parade Safety  Mayor Bloomberg appointed a task force of city officials to determine why a giant helium balloon swung wildly in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade -- knocking a light fixture onto two sisters -- and to examine whether safety procedures need to be revamped for future parades.</p>

        <p>New Worry for Indian Point</p>
        <p>Owners of the Indian Point 2 plant in Buchanan, N.Y., say there is no danger from a radioactive water leak in the plant. The leak, which was found in September, has been the latest worry for local officials already concerned by repeated failures in tests of the plant's emergency system.</p>

As the NCAA begins enforcing a ban on Indian imagery that it considers ''hostile or abusive,'' the arena and its logos illustrate the passions surrounding the issue and the complexities in resolving it.</p>
