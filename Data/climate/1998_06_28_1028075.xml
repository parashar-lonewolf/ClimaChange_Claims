        <p>The lake, like thousands of others created by New York's ancient glaciers, is small and remote, a narrow valley of water less than two miles, end to end.

Our basement and the balsam trees outside the windows are uncommonly silent.</p>

        <p>The lake, like thousands of others created by New York's ancient glaciers, is small and remote, a narrow valley of water less than two miles, end to end. At one time, its underground springs nurtured brook trout, and to hear the old fishermen talk, these glistening creatures tasted like no modern food, certainly not like the experimental, acid-resistant species now grown, ''neutered'' and dumped from state helicopters into the lakes below.</p>
        <p>Acid rain from the Midwest is the plague that we often use to explain our ghostly fish, as well as our forests singed orange by thunderstorms and the neighboring ponds turning as tart as lemon juice. It is an all-purpose peril, this cloud-borne pollution, and it can even be adapted to explain seasonal aberrations in the nature of things. This year, for example, there are no mice and no chipmunks. Our basement and the balsam trees outside the windows are uncommonly silent.</p>
        <p>We can blame distant industries for the silence, but the noise we bring on ourselves. And it is one of the reasons that some neighbors no longer wave automatically to each other as their boats or cars pass within eyeing distance. Our lake, which of course does not belong to any of us who borrow it for a few months each summer, has become a tense battleground in the national recreation wars between those who yearn for nature's quiet and those who thrill to man-made sound -- in our case, the big-throated roar of a high-speed motorboat.</p>
        <p>The split between the big boaters and the small boaters has hardened people on both sides of our tiny summer community. When we tried a do-it-yourself solution a few years ago, the majority did not rule because there was no real way to enforce our communal law on the minority. ''Un-American,'' the angry few grumbled, as we worked to stop the high horsepower motors from churning our small lake into a thick brown stew. ''Nobody can tell me what to do in the Adirondacks,'' they said, thereby muscling their freedom into position as the only freedom allowed.</p>
        <p>Like other lakeside communities, we then moved our petitions for relief to local and state governments. This season we are fighting over something called ''no-wake zones.'' Ever since 1942, New York State law has decreed that most boats, but not those launching skiers or barges in canals, must move slowly within 100 feet of the shore. Now the idea is to expand the slow zone to 200 feet from shore to stop erosion and turbidity, and improve safety for humans and wildlife.</p>
        <p>John Miller, president of the New York State Federation of Lakes, tends the lakes in our area like a shepherd worrying over his flock. He has been pushing the 200-foot zone because he argues that although the number of motorboats in the state is growing, from 100,000 or so in 1942 to almost 500,000 today, ''the number of lakes stays the same.''</p>
        <p>Those of us who watch the gasoline scum on  the water surface and hear the loons screaming at boats several hundred yards away know that 200 feet is a  very short distance between a waterway and a wilderness.</p>
