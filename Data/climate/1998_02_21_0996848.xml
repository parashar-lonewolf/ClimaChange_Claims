        <p>In a ceremony held yesterday in Christchurch, New Zealand, the United States Navy formally ended the predominant role it has played during the last 43 years of American operations in Antarctica.</p>
        <p>The Navy's major function was to move supplies and people between the outer world and the Antarctic continent. In recent years, the Navy and Royal New Zealand Air Force have cooperated in maintaining an air link between Christchurch and McMurdo Station, as well as Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station and many field camps. The Navy's air support of American stations in Antarctica has been taken over by the 109th Air Wing of the New York Air National Guard.</p>

        <p>In a ceremony held yesterday in Christchurch, New Zealand, the United States Navy formally ended the predominant role it has played during the last 43 years of American operations in Antarctica.</p>
        <p>The Navy's major function was to move supplies and people between the outer world and the Antarctic continent. In recent years, the Navy and Royal New Zealand Air Force have cooperated in maintaining an air link between Christchurch and McMurdo Station, as well as Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station and many field camps. The Navy's air support of American stations in Antarctica has been taken over by the 109th Air Wing of the New York Air National Guard.</p>
        <p>Air transportation to and within Antarctica will continue to be flown mostly by ski-equipped C-130 Hercules transport planes owned by the National Science Foundation.</p>
        <p>Although American activities in Antarctica have always focused on scientific research, successive administrations since the time of President Franklin D. Roosevelt have regarded an American presence in Antarctica as essential to United States strategic interests. In 1957, with the cold war becoming increasingly intense, the Navy led a huge expedition called Operation Deep Freeze that charted vast regions of the continent. One of its leaders was Rear Adm. Richard E. Byrd, the polar explorer who in 1929 had commanded the first overflight of the South Pole.</p>
        <p>In the last three decades, most American operations in Antarctica have been under the authority of the National Science Foundation, although the Navy ran station kitchens, stores, security and transportation. The science foundation has contracted these functions to a commercial organization, Antarctic Support Associates based in Denver.</p>
        <p>At yesterday's ceremony a plaque was unveiled listing the names of 50 Americans, military and civilian, who died in Antarctica over the years.</p>
        <p>A statement prepared for the ceremony by Dr. Neal F. Lane, director of the science foundation, said:</p>
        <p>''We thank the Navy for decades of support, which has helped to advance research important to the future of our planet studies on the ozone hole, the stability of Antarctica's ice sheets, and the dynamics of the Southern Ocean.''</p>
