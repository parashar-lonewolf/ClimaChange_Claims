        <p>Editorial on increasingly pointed criticism of sport utility vehicles for dangers they pose on the road, their environmental costs and and huge contribution they make to nation's growing dependence on imported oil</p>

        <p>The 1990's economic boom, combined with cheap gasoline, turned the sport utility vehicle -- the S.U.V. -- into one of Detroit's most popular and profitable products. Lately, though, S.U.V.'s have been taking their lumps, including sharp criticism from the new head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Jeffrey Runge, one of the first federal officials to speak openly and honestly about rollovers and other hazards associated with a vehicle that the industry insists is essential to its economic survival.</p>
        <p>But most of the criticism remains focused on the vehicles' environmental costs and the huge contribution they make to the nation's growing dependence on imported oil. And properly so: S.U.V.'s produce, on average, 40 percent more carbon dioxide -- the main global warming gas -- than ordinary cars. They are also far less efficient than ordinary cars, averaging as little as 13 miles a gallon in city traffic.</p>
        <p>It's past time to change all that. Even the Bush administration is getting nervous. A massive loophole in federal law allows S.U.V.'s -- and all other vehicles technically classified as light trucks, including minivans -- to achieve an average fleetwide standard of 20.7 miles per gallon, compared with the 27.5 miles per gallon required of regular passenger cars. The administration recently proposed a slight increase from 20.7 miles per gallon to 22.2 miles per gallon by 2007.</p>
        <p>A bipartisan bill introduced last week in the Senate by Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, and Olympia Snowe, Republican of Maine, would reach much higher -- a 33 percent increase for all light trucks to 27.5 miles per gallon by 2011. That would not only bring S.U.V.'s and minivans into line with the standard for ordinary cars but, when fully effective, would save this country a million barrels of oil a day -- more than a third of what we now import from the Persian Gulf. Technologically, this is easily within Detroit's reach. Indeed, most manufacturers are already planning limited rollouts of gas/electric hybrid cars capable of 40 or more miles per gallon.</p>
        <p>The question is whether it is within Congress's reach. Similar proposals were crushed last year in the House and Senate by the combined weight of the automakers and the unions. The White House, fearing both, did nothing to help the cause. Perhaps this time it will: oil dependency is no less an issue, and the S.U.V. problem seems to have registered, however faintly, on the White House radar.</p>
        <p>But the bill will not succeed without the vigorous intervention of President Bush himself, who at the moment seems enraptured by the hydrogen car. Unfortunately, the hydrogen car and the vast infrastructure needed to fuel it are at best 20 years away, probably a lot longer, whereas the problems we face now -- air pollution, global warming, oil dependency -- require immediate attention. And that means making the cars we have now a lot cleaner and a lot more efficient -- starting with S.U.V.'s.</p>
