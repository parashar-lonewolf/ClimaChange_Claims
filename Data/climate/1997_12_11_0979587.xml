        <p>For the United States to meet the promises agreed to at the global warming conference in Japan, Americans would have to make significant, sustained cuts in their use of fossil fuels, beginning immediately and lasting well into the next century.</p>
        <p>The nation's consumption of coal and oil would have to decline by as much as 30 percent from the levels now projected for 10 or 15 years from now, marking the first step toward what proponents of the treaty say would be a radical restructuring of the economy's patterns of energy use later in the 21st century.</p>
        <p>In the short term, it would require car makers to sell more efficient vehicles, power companies to give up coal and people to learn to be miserly when choosing light bulbs, air-conditioners and appliances. In the long term there could be a wholesale turn to novel devices like combustion-free fuel cells and solar and wind power.  Economists and advocates may dispute whether the economy would be better or worse off as a result, but it would have to be markedly different.</p>
        <p>The country has made no sacrifices remotely like this since the oil shocks of the 1970's. At the moment, the American appetite for fossil fuels, and therefore emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, is growing.</p>
        <p>Last month the Energy Department reckoned in its long-term forecast that this trend, fed by cheap fuel and strong economic growth, was likely to continue for decades.</p>
        <p>So as exhausted delegates straggle home from rancorous all-night talks in Kyoto, the question is whether the United States -- where per capita emissions of carbon dioxide are more than double Japan's, triple France's and 10 times Brazil's -- has the economic strength, the brainpower and the political will to put into practice what its negotiators have promised.</p>
        <p>The least of the problems is technology. Although expensive, substitutes for carbon fuels are already available.</p>
        <p>But the political barriers look formidable. Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, called the treaty's prospects bleak even before the ink was dry, and Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, a Democrat who favors the treaty, cautioned against rushing to seek Senate approval. Not only would the Senate have to consent to the treaty, but both houses of Congress would have to approve any legislation to carry it out, like emissions caps, a permit-trading plan, tax incentives, research budgets or reorganization of the utility industry.</p>
        <p>As for enforcing a national energy diet, no one knows what combination of rewards and punishments might be needed to change course and head toward the targets that would be imposed under the new regime.</p>
        <p>The Energy Department has projected that emissions of carbon from energy use will rise 1.2 percent a year until 2020. Between 2008 and 2012, when the treaty calls for reductions to be achieved, emissions are headed toward 1.8 billion metric tons a year, the agency said. The new goal under the treaty would be 1.25 billion tons during the same period.</p>
        <p>Only a small part of the reduction -- at most 160 million tons a year, American negotiators say -- might be achieved by trading credits with Russia, whose emissions dropped sharply when its economic output collapsed along with Communism.</p>
        <p>To meet these goals, most analysts say governments would have to put caps on emissions. But the Clinton Administration favors market-based mechanisms like trading pollution permits, rather than rigid regulations, to let companies decide for themselves how to meet the limits.</p>
        <p>''President Clinton is right that getting to anything below 1990 levels in the U.S. is going to be a big stretch,'' said Christopher Flavin, an energy efficiency expert at the Worldwatch Institute, an environmental group. ''Even if we are partly to buy our way there with credits from Russia, there is still going to have to be a lot done at home.''</p>
        <p>Opponents of the treaty agreed with that assessment.</p>
        <p>''The energy use curbs needed to comply with the climate treaty are far deeper than expected,'' said the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a pro-business research and advocacy group. It said provisions to allow international emissions trading and other offsets would only ''disguise the pain.''</p>
        <p>But there are several approaches, some buried in the treaty text and others being developed by the Clinton Administration as unilateral actions, that might help.</p>
        <p>For example, the treaty makes allowances for trading pollution control credits among countries if that would provide cheaper ways of reducing worldwide emissions for what is, after all, a global problem.</p>
        <p>The treaty also would allow countries to receive credit for certain changes in land use and forestry practices against their emissions limit, on the ground that trees take in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as they grow and store the carbon for decades in the form of wood.</p>
        <p>The Clinton Administration is working on a package of tax incentives and research subsidies that would accelerate the introduction of renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, which do not emit carbon, and energy-efficiency technologies that use far less fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy and other conservation advocates have called for tax incentives for any vehicle, whether a compact car or a lumbering sport utility vehicle, that achieved double the fuel efficiency of today's comparable models.</p>
        <p>Any car could double its fuel efficiency by using hybrid gas-and-electric technologies that are just coming onto the market.</p>
        <p>Another crucial opportunity for reducing fossil fuel consumption may come with the opening of the electric utility industry to nationwide competition.</p>
