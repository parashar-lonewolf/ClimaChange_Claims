        <p>High-pressure steam heat has always been the life-force of BASF A.G.'s giant chemical complex here, where one street is named Ammonia and another is named after a catastrophic explosion that killed scores of workers in the 1920's.</p>
        <p>The old power plant still burns coal by the bargeload, pumping high-pressure steam to heat reactions for making plastics and fibers and spewing about four million tons of ''greenhouse'' gases into the atmosphere every year. Until recently, this complex burned so much coal that the company owned its own mines.</p>
        <p>Yet as American and European negotiators battle in Kyoto, Japan, over a proposed treaty to reduce the output of greenhouse gases implicated in global warming, this complex marks a fairly typical example of how the two sides often seem to be on different planets.</p>
        <p>While American industry has warned that mandatory reductions would lead to factory shutdowns and hundreds of thousands of lost jobs, BASF executives say they are not worried.</p>
        <p>Regardless of what is decided in Kyoto, BASF executives predict, this complex will emit 25 percent less carbon dioxide in the year 2000 than it did in 1990, well ahead of the ambitious goals advocated by the European Union. ''The goals are absolutely achievable,'' said Max Dietrich Kley, BASF's managing director in charge of financial affairs.</p>
        <p>Europe already releases less than half the volume per person of greenhouse gases as the United States. And it is urging a 15 percent cut in the industrialized world's discharges from 1990 levels, compared to the Clinton Administration's call for ''stabilizing'' emissions at those rates.</p>
        <p>Compared to American business groups, European industry has been more receptive to the costly cleanup. Manufacturing groups are pursuing their own ambitious clean-air commitments. The debate here is not about whether to make steep reductions in carbon dioxide output, but how steep those reductions should be.</p>
        <p>By any measure, Europe will have a hard time meeting its own ambitious goals. Pollution from cars and trucks is soaring, as traffic volume increases far more rapidly than automobile efficiency. Manufacturing executives warn that even big improvements in efficiency will be diluted by growth in overall production. And European industry has been fighting various proposals for stiff new ''carbon'' taxes that are tied to the use of fossil fuels. Thus far they have not gone anywhere.</p>
        <p>''We are very skeptical about the European goals,'' said Joachim Hein, head of environmental policy at the German Federation of Industry, which has pledged steep voluntary reductions. ''It's easy to put more burdens on industry, but the problem is much more multi-faceted than that. What we are saying is that industry will do its best.''</p>
        <p>Critics note that Europe has benefited from a few one-time historical events. The reunification of Germany in 1990 led to a huge reduction in emissions, because the former East Germany's bankrupt and filthy factories and power plants were quickly demolished. Between 1990 and 1995, carbon dioxide output in eastern Germany plunged by nearly half, to 172 million tons from 305 million.</p>
        <p>Britain got a similar boost when the Government abandoned protections for domestic coal producers, which sparked a rapid shift to cleaner natural gas.</p>
        <p>Part of what makes Europe look ''greener,'' moreover, is nuclear power, considered an environmental villain in North America. Nuclear power supplies 75 percent of the electricity in France, 50 percent in Sweden and 30 percent in Germany, compared with 20 percent in the United States.</p>
        <p>As Europe's economy picks up, some energy-conservation projections are already falling by the wayside. The Netherlands Federation of Industry, for example, committed itself to improve energy efficiency by 2 percent a year. But Dutch carbon dioxide emissions actually grew  slightly last year, largely because of increased economic growth.</p>
        <p>''What we have done so far is follow a 'no-regrets' policy,'' said Wiel Klerken, director of environmental  issues at the Dutch trade association. ''In other words, these are measures that are good anyway, even if there was not a CO2  problem, because you save money. But when you come to 15 percent reductions, you come into the area of 'regrets policy,' and so we think the current goals are too ambitious.''</p>
        <p>Nor have European countries entirely figured out how to distribute the burden of making changes. Under the European Union's so-called ''bubble'' concept, Germany agreed to assume a huge share of the total European burden -- a 25 percent cut  in emissions by 2010. The bargain would allow poorer countries like Portugal and Ireland to increase  emissions as much as 30 percent.</p>
        <p>The problem is that even if each country met its obligations, which is far from assured, emissions of greenhouse gases across Europe would fall by only 10 percent, and national leaders would still need to search for more cuts.</p>
        <p>By any measure, the efforts within Europe far outpace anything even contemplated in the United States. The German Federation of Industry, the umbrella association that covers manufacturers of everything from cars to steel to chemicals, recently released audited results showing a 20 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions since 1990.</p>
        <p>But those gains are in danger of being undermined by some of the same trends as in the United States: faster growth in manufacturing and an intensified love affair with cars. Officials at the German industrial federation emphasize that the demolition of old East German factories and power plants is complete. And while existing factories will inevitably become more efficient, those advances will also be diluted by continued growth in production.</p>
        <p>Pollution from cars and trucks is even more threatening. While cars are generally much smaller than those in the United States, they are getting bigger, heavier and more numerous. The number of privately owned cars in the former East Germany is expected to double between 1990 and 2005, and the number of commercial vehicles to increase six-fold in the same period.</p>
        <p>Car and truck traffic is already the second-biggest source of carbon dioxide after power plants in the European Union, and officials predict traffic-related emissions will soar 39 percent by the year 2010 if current policies remain in place.</p>
        <p>Yet thus far, European Union proposals for ''carbon taxes'' on gasoline have gone nowhere, and many experts worry that introducing them would jeopardize national competitiveness if other industrial countries refuse to follow suit.</p>
        <p>To some extent, European countries are victims of their own energy thrift. Energy prices here are far higher than those in the United States, and mandatory conservation measures are far more widespread. That makes further choices more difficult and more expensive.</p>
        <p>Buildings, for example, are already being constructed according to far stricter energy-efficiency standards than in the United States. The next big round of improvements can only come from renovating old buildings -- an expensive job that governments cannot simply order property owners to carry out.</p>
        <p>''Buildings will be a major challenge,'' said Alfred Voss, head of the Institute for Energy Economics and Rational Energy Use at the University of Stuttgart. Homeowners often have little incentive to invest in more efficient boilers or thermal windows, because the costs are high and the payoff can take years. Commercial landlords are often resistant as well, especially if tenants pick up the costs of heating and electricity.</p>
        <p>Europe has nothing to apologize to the rest of the world about, of course. Compared with efforts being made almost anywhere else, European companies are models of environmental enlightenment.</p>
        <p>The biggest single element reducing carbon dioxide emissions here in Ludwigshafen, for example, is a one-month-old ''co-generation'' plant that produces both electricity and high-pressure steam heat. It will burn natural gas, which emits one-half as much carbon-dioxide as a coal-fired power plant, to produce all the steam heat that BASF needs.  Excess steam pressure will be used to run electric turbines. BASF can buy whatever electricity it wants, and the rest will be fed into the public electricity grid. Overall, company executives say, the new plant produces heat and electricity at about 88 percent efficiency, more than double that of the old coal plant.</p>
        <p>Other co-generation ventures are underway elsewhere. Hoechst A.G., the chemical and pharmaceutical conglomerate, is underwriting an 800-megawatt plant in Frankfurt.</p>
        <p>BASF is also systematically slashed its reliance on fossil fuels by re-cycling heat from one process to another. The complex here at Ludwigshafen relies on coal or gas for only 25 percent of the energy it uses, down from 75 percent 20 years ago.  And deeper reductions are on the way. The company's newest plant, in Antwerp, relies on fossil fuels for only 5 percent of its total energy use.</p>
        <p>BASF is not just trying to be a good world citizen. Its main motivation is to save money -- and in that, it exemplifies Europe's pervasive culture of energy conservation.</p>
        <p>German energy prices are among the highest in the world, in part because the Government protected domestic coal producers for decades. European gasoline costs between $3 and $4 a gallon, roughly three times higher than American prices. Yet, the political debate is not whether to lower the huge fuel taxes that are responsible, but whether to raise them.</p>
        <p>Electricity and heat costs are often higher, especially in countries like Germany that have been protecting domestic coal producers. For that reason, few protest the stringent energy-efficiency standards for new buildings here in Germany. Also largely for that reason, air conditioning is almost non-existent in homes and is absent from many office buildings. Lights in public hallways are designed to switch off when people leave. And thanks in part to shorter distances within Europe, trains remain a far more important mode of passenger transportation than airplanes, which consume much more energy.</p>
        <p>Political support for deep reductions in greenhouse emissions has been strong across Europe. Even Great Britain, which often displays American-style hostility to regulation, has supported tough action on greenhouse gases under both Conservative and Labor governments.</p>
        <p>''In Europe, there is a perception that energy is expensive and will continue to be expensive in the future, while Americans have a perception that energy is cheap and will continue to be cheap,'' said Lee Solsbery, director of energy and environmental issues at the International Energy Agency in Paris.</p>
        <p>The key challenge, said Professor Voss of the University of Stuttgart, will be to come up with policies that promote deeper reductions and yet do not jeopardize economic growth. ''If you are going to make real progress, you have to treat economic and environmental goals. The danger is that people will not do that, which could mean that you reach neither goal.''</p>

        <p>A chart on Thursday with an article about European efforts to reduce emissions of heat-trapping ''greenhouse'' gases showed erroneous figures for per capita emissions of carbon dioxide in the United States and Europe in 1995. A corrected chart appears today on page A10.</p>
