        <p>Love Is Cloudy</p>
        <p>You've heard of the fog of war; for the sand goby, there's what might be called the fog of love.</p>
        <p>Researchers in Finland have found that the mating system of the sand goby, a small shallows-dwelling fish, is altered when the water is cloudy. Under such conditions, which can be caused by too much algal growth, or eutrophication, the reproductive advantage that larger fish normally have disappears.</p>
        <p>The researchers, from the University of Helsinki, studied gobies from the Baltic, where high levels of pollution cause intense algal blooms, particularly during the goby breeding season. All that algae, both alive and decaying, makes the water more turbid, changing both the amount and frequencies of light reaching the bottom.</p>
        <p>A male sand goby creates a nest under a shell or rock, defending it from other males and attracting a female, who lays her eggs on the nest's ceiling. During breeding season, one of the male's fins turns blue-black, and a bright blue spot appears on another.</p>
        <p>Females have been shown to prefer large and more colorful males. A large healthy male thus has an advantage in sexual selection, often attracting multiple mates.</p>
        <p>That's in clear water. In their experiments, described in The Proceedings of the Royal Society B, the researchers reproduced the turbid conditions of a Baltic algal bloom.</p>
        <p>They found that while the total number of eggs spawned was about that same as under clear conditions, in the cloudy water the eggs were more evenly distributed among nests. Larger fish did not have appreciably more eggs in their nests than smaller ones.</p>
        <p>The researchers are not sure why this advantage disappears, but they suggest that the males' blue coloration may no longer be visible to the females. Or more generally, the stress induced by the algae may make females less choosy.</p>
        <p>Birds of a Different Color</p>
        <p>In the northern Andes of Colombia and Ecuador, there are two species of mountain tanager that are similar enough to confuse even the most experienced bird-watcher.</p>
        <p>Both the blue-winged and black-chinned tanagers have vibrant blue trim on the wings and tail plumage, yellow on the crown and underbelly, black on the head and olive on the rump. Only the back is slightly different: black in the blue-wing, olive in the black-chin.</p>
        <p>Those are the colors that humans can see. Birds, though, are sensitive to near-ultraviolet light. Differences in UV reflectance of plumage have been shown to play a role in how some birds recognize members of their own species, but Dr. Robert Bleiweiss of the University of Wisconsin wondered in this case if it could contribute to distinctions among closely related species.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bleiweiss, whose work is published in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, measured UV reflectance of specimens of both tanagers.</p>
        <p>The backs of both species, similarly drab and dull under ordinary light, were strikingly different in the UV range. Reflectance was high for the black-chinned tanager but low for its cousin.</p>
        <p>The results suggest that the differences in UV reflectance are what enables one species to recognize the other, contributing to their reproductive isolation.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bleiweiss found further evidence for this in the natural variation in back color that occurs among different subspecies of blue-winged tanagers, some of which have more of an olive color, like the blue-chinned birds. But Dr. Bleiweiss found that all the subspecies (which by definition can interbreed) have similar low UV reflectance.</p>
        <p>Meteor Drizzle</p>
        <p>It's mid-November, time for the annual sky show called the Leonid meteor shower. The shower, which is caused by the Earth's passing through or close to dust trails of the comet Tempel-Tuttle, is expected to peak close to 2 a.m. Friday on the East Coast.</p>
        <p>That peak is not expected to be very high -- on the order of 10 meteors per hour, nothing like the thousands per hour experienced from 1999 to 2001.</p>
        <p>When the Grizzlies Headed South</p>
        <p>Brown bears, like humans, are thought to have arrived in North America from Asia by crossing a land bridge between the continents. The bears (Ursos arctos, also known as grizzlies) crossed over much earlier than humans: 150,000 to 100,000 years ago.</p>
        <p>For a long time, scientists believed, the bears did not get much farther than what is known as east Beringia, present-day Alaska and the Yukon. They made it farther south into what is now southern Canada and the northern United States only about 13,000 years ago. That's when ice sheets that had coalesced to cover the region about 10,000 years earlier melted enough to allow the animals to migrate through an ice-free corridor.</p>
        <p>Or so it's been thought. A recent discovery by a University of Alaska researcher and colleagues has upset that time scale considerably. Brown bears, they report in the journal Science, were south of east Beringia at least 25,000 years ago. They apparently made it south before the ice sheets blocked movement.</p>
        <p>The researcher, Dr. Paul Matheus, was ''poking around'' a museum in Edmonton, Alberta, he said, when he found a bear jawbone that had been discovered in the area. Using radiocarbon techniques, he determined that it was about 25,000 years old.</p>
        <p>''We hadn't had any old brown bears south of Beringia,'' Dr. Matheus said. ''This one was kind of out of place. My thought was, 'It shouldn't be here.'''</p>
        <p>''But we now think we have very compelling evidence that brown bears were farther south before the glaciers coalesced'' about 23,000 years ago, he said.</p>
        <p>Analysis of mitochondrial DNA extracted from the specimen showed that it was genetically similar to bears in southern Canada and the northern United States today. Other studies have shown that this genetically similar group, called Clade 4, existed in Beringia more than 35,000 years ago but vanished and never reappeared in the north. Dr. Matheus said he thought he now knew why.</p>
        <p>''Our conclusion is that these bears got stuck south of the ice front,'' he said. In other words, the ice didn't prevent bears from migrating south as much as it prevented bears that had traveled south earlier from going back north. ''The whole Clade 4 must have been stuck,'' he said.</p>
