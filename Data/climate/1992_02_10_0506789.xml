        <p>Even as they try to meet increasingly strict energy efficiency requirements, makers of home refrigerators and freezers are likely to face a new and costly challenge: finding alternatives to the use of ozone-damaging chemicals sooner than they had planned.</p>
        <p>An accelerated phase-out of these chemicals, known as chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's, would also force the owners of billions of dollars of industrial and commercial chilling devices to modify their equipment to use alternative chemicals, none of them a direct substitute for the compounds in use today. Chemical manufacturers say they will have the capacity to supply alternatives as they are needed.</p>
        <p>The Bush Administration is supporting legislation that would advance the date to end production of CFC's, making it likely that they will be off the market by the mid-1990's.</p>
        <p>The Senate voted 96 to 0 in favor of this legislation on Thursday without setting a firm date. The senators acted shortly after a report was released saying that ozone-destroying chemicals were accumulating faster than expected over North America. Push for Earlier Ban</p>
        <p>Under the international Montreal Protocol for ending CFC use, CFC's are to be eliminated by 2000. But the European Community has agreed to advance that date to mid-1997, environmental groups have been calling for a phase-out by 1995, and an industry coalition has suggested 1996.</p>
        <p>The chemicals are essential to refrigerators and freezers, both as refrigerants and as a component of plastic foam insulation. Appliance manufacturers have been testing the alternatives being offered by chemical producers, but are not yet satisfied they will perform as well as CFC's or have the same durability.</p>
        <p>Marian Stamos, a spokeswoman for the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, said appliance makers were spending more than $800 million to meet Energy Department efficiency regulations that take effect next year; a redesign to use substitutes for CFC's would be on top of these costs.</p>
        <p>"The companies are going to have to make big capital outlays earlier than they should," she said.  Burden of Regulations</p>
        <p>She said that the industry, which manufactures most of its products domestically, felt squeezed by the requirement for greater efficiency when CFC's, which are the most efficient refrigerant fluids and insulating materials, are likely to be banned in a few years. "They are really starting to feel the cumulative burden of all these environmental regulations," she said.</p>
        <p>Two families of chemicals, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, or HCFC's, and hydrofluorocarbons, or HFC's, are being developed to replace the CFC's now in use. HFC's present no known danger to the ozone, but HCFC's do, though to a much lesser degree than CFC's.</p>
        <p>Since HFC's cannot be substituted for CFC's in some applications, chemical companies have argued that HCFC's are essential until substitutes can be developed. Environmental groups have called for an early phase-out of HCFC's as well, but chemical companies say they need to produce for about 30 years to recover their investments.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the chemical companies say they are building plants to manufacture the alternates. "Three plants are already running, two more are under construction and a sixth one is in the advanced planning stage," said Anthony Vogelsberg, an environmental official at E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company, a big maker of CFC's.</p>
        <p>Spokesmen for Allied-Signal Inc.  and ICI Americas Inc., two other large producers of CFC's, said they were also building plants to make alternative chemicals. Recycling Used Chemicals</p>
        <p>CFC refrigerants do not wear out in use, but they do become contaminated. Producers of industrial chilling equipment have developed devices to recover dirty CFC's, so they can be processed and reused.</p>
        <p>But as CFC's become scarce and expensive after production is halted, owners of cooling equipment will have to invest in modifications to use whatever substitute is proposed. Mr. Vogelsberg estimated that an industrial chilling unit costing $175,000 would need from $10,000 to $50,000 in changes to use the HCFC compound that Du Pont is proposing to substitute for the CFC's now in use.</p>
        <p>Chemical industry executives say some CFC production is likely even after a general ban goes into effect, because substitutes will be hard to find. One likely exception is for propellants in medical inhalers, they said.</p>
