        <p>FOR decades, tourists would come to Nantucket and shop for dainty lightship baskets. Now they can buy an entire 600-ton lightship.</p>
        <p>This summer, the 128-foot-long Nantucket Lightship is for sale: by the week, month or whole season, from mid-May through mid-October. For the right price, the ship can be yours permanently.</p>
        <p>Officially known as WLV 612, the Nantucket was one of a succession of vessels anchored about 40 miles southeast of the island since 1854 to warn coastal and trans-Atlantic maritime traffic away from the treacherous Nantucket Shoals and to serve as the outermost welcome mat for New York Harbor.</p>
        <p>The first was blown all the way to Montauk in a storm. In 1934, another was rammed in dense fog by the liner Olympic, sister ship to the Titanic, and sunk. The WLV 612, sister ship of the Ambrose, now moored at the South Street Seaport in Manhattan, was the last such lightship still in service when it was decommissioned in 1985 and replaced by an automated fixed buoy. Outbidding several scrap dealers, William Golden, a lawyer and former Massachusetts state senator, bought the Nantucket for $126,000 on eBay in 2000 and invested several million dollars to restore the beacons, the brass wheelhouse and other fixtures of a working lightship while converting it into a sumptuous private yacht. (It originally cost $500,000 to build in 1950, or about $4 million in 2005 dollars.)</p>
        <p>After renovations were completed, the ship was moored in Boston, where Mr. Golden and his wife live on it during the winter; for the summer, the ship is docked at Commercial Wharf on Nantucket or is anchored in the harbor. The Goldens intend to continue living on it in the off-season while selling fractional ownership that amounts to 75 percent of the equity.</p>
        <p>Buyers can choose among one-week shares ( before July or after August) for a one-time investment of between $150,000 and $250,000 (plus from $10,108 to $16,910 in expenses a year). All of July is available for $1.6 million (plus $108,110 in expenses) and all of August for $1.9 million (plus $128,364 in expenses). The full season will cost you $5,625,000 (plus $380,000 in expenses). Buyers get full run of the ship.</p>
        <p>Those prices might make prospective buyers blanch almost anywhere but Nantucket, where the average home now sells for more than $1.5 million. Not only is the vista from the lightship's anchorage incomparable -- a 360-degree postcard panorama of barrier beaches and quaint town -- but everybody can envy your big red boat. And, unlike other waterfront landlords, the lightship's owners don't have to worry about beach erosion or rising sea levels.</p>
        <p>EXPENSES cover the three-member crew, insurance, maintenance and fuel while the ship is anchored in Nantucket Harbor and the use of two tenders to transport owners and their guests. Food, maid service and dockage elsewhere are extra. So is the cost of traveling to other ports (the ship has a range of 4,000 miles, but plods along at 10 knots, or about 12 miles an hour).</p>
        <p>So far, the Goldens have had no takers. ''This has always been a business project,'' Mr. Golden said. ''We sought to save it from being scrapped, restore it at a level that survives in perpetuity, figure out a plan that would keep her in Nantucket and see if we could make some money. We haven't as yet.''</p>
        <p>Liza Ottani of Atlantic East Real Estate Nantucket, which represents the owners, said that a number of people have expressed interest in purchasing shares. Also, she said, three generations of one family have signed up to rent the ship for a week in August for $25,000 (it's $18,000 a week in September) -- a price that is comparable to weekly rentals for a number of Nantucket homes. This season, the ship is also available for charter and for parties (it can accommodate 144).</p>
        <p>The Coast Guard crew wouldn't recognize it. Below the 2,000-square-foot weather deck are 4,000 square feet of air-conditioned living space, including five staterooms (the ship has a crew of three and sleeps between 12 and 16), six and a half bathrooms, a den, a dining area in the main salon, a kitchen and a game room. A hot tub is being installed atop the wheelhouse. Mr. Golden's wife, Kristen, helped design the interior's cozy nautical motif in mahogany, cherry and birch.</p>
        <p>The engine room and the laundry room, which also houses the windlass for the 7,000-pound anchor, are practically the only remnants of the original ship, which served in several locations before being assigned to Nantucket in 1975. The ship's two beacons were restored, as were the dual foghorns, but Mrs. Ottani politely warned a visitor against activating them, at least while the ship was in port.</p>
        <p>''They're loud enough to shatter windows,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The ship, which has a steel hull, was designed for strength and stability in rough seas. But, as a result, one feature that survived the renovation can be slightly disorienting to landlubbers: The main deck slopes upward from stern to bow.</p>
        <p>Theoretically, a new owner could weigh anchor and move to another port, giving a whole new dimension to the lament, ''there goes the neighborhood.'' But Mr. Golden says that's unlikely. ''I believe the ship and its significance are so enhanced by the magic of Nantucket,'' he said.</p>
