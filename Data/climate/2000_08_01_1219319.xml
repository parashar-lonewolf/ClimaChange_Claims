        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>On reading ''How Bush Came to Tame His Inner Scamp'' (front page, July 29), I was troubled by the prospect of a president, should George W. Bush be elected, whose personal philosophy of the future seems to be encapsulated in his comment: ''I just don't worry about those things. I kind of figure life is going to work its way out somehow.''</p>
        <p>I fear for our future if such a cavalier attitude reflects how a President George W. Bush would deal with long-term problems like the human contribution to global warming, the international consequences of developing a nuclear missile shield, Social Security shortfalls, defects in our criminal justice system, and so on.</p>
