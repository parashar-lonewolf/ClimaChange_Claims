        <p>LEAD: Eighteen years after passage of the Clean Air Act, 100 million Americans still breathe unhealthy, ozone-laden air, and acid rain continues to kill lakes and burn forests throughout the United States and Canada.

        <p>Eighteen years after passage of the Clean Air Act, 100 million Americans still breathe unhealthy, ozone-laden air, and acid rain continues to kill lakes and burn forests throughout the United States and Canada. Air pollution has been reduced, but not by enough. The White House, Congress and polluters resist the hard choices necessary for further protection of public health and the environment.</p>
        <p>Some 70 cities will fail to bring their ozone levels to Federal safety levels by the present deadline of Aug. 31. Some will miss by a mile. Air in the New York region, breathed by 17 million people, sometimes contains 50 percent more ozone than permitted. The law provides for sanctions, but they are so Draconian that in practice Congress won't let them be applied.</p>
        <p>Ozone is created when hydrocarbons and nitrogen dioxide are heated by sunlight. Unlike the ozone in the stratosphere, which protects against the sun's rays, the ozone in urban smog damages human lungs and destroys plant tissues. The major source of hydrocarbons is gasoline. Though emission control devices have reduced hydrocarbons from automobile engines by 95 percent, cars still contribute 60 percent of the hydrocarbons in urban air.</p>
        <p>Securing further reductions in hydrocarbons and ozone is hard but essential. This year is shaping up as the worst in a decade for ozone pollution. New studies warn that the health threat from ozone is more serious than supposed and that the safety standard needs further tightening.</p>
        <p>Yet the Environmental Protection Agency won't go beyond minor technical fixes. It plans to tell the petroleum industry to formulate gasoline that gives off less fumes and to have auto makers install canisters that recycle fumes from the engine. What's needed is a new law, to ensure that auto makers produce cars that stay cleaner over greater mileage, that towns tackle even small sources of pollutants, such as paint shops and dry cleaners, and that cities like New York reduce the number of vehicles on city streets and switch fleets of cars and buses over to clean-burning fuels like methanol.</p>
        <p>The Administration is even more indifferent to acid rain. For eight years its policy has been to do nothing but study acid rain and ignore the completed studies when they call for immediate action.</p>
        <p>In Congress, Representative Henry Waxman of California and Senator George Mitchell of Maine have led strenuous efforts to combat smog and acid rain. But their attempts to revise the Clean Air Act are resisted by industrial and regional interests.</p>
        <p>Operators of coal-burning power plants in the Ohio Valley would rather export their pollutants through tall smokestacks than install expensive scrubbers. Miners in West Virginia fear their high-sulfur coal will lose markets to low-sulfur coal from the West. Detroit's automobile manufacturers resist any tightening of emission controls.</p>
        <p>In the void of Presidential leadership, the hope for cleaner air has been throttled in the Congress, chiefly by Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia and Representative John Dingell of Michigan.</p>
        <p>Their opposition is dismaying. Smog is burning the lungs of millions of Americans, and acid rain is steadily eating away at the viability of natural systems. Cleaning up pollution is expensive, but the costs of continuing to assault health and nature are already proving intolerable.</p>
