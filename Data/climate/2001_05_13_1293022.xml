        <p>WITH the threat of electricity shortages looming in many parts of the country, is it time to reconsider nuclear power?</p>
        <p>Vice President Dick Cheney certainly thinks so. ''We can safeguard the environment by making greater use of the cleanest method of power generation we know,'' he said in a speech last month outlining the Bush administration's coming energy policy proposals. ''If we are serious about environmental protection, then we must seriously question the wisdom of backing away from what is, as a matter of record, a safe, clean and very plentiful energy source.''</p>
        <p>And longstanding advocates for atomic energy like Mr. Cheney are not the only ones who now argue that more nuclear plants may be needed to temper the burning of fossil fuels -- coal, oil and even natural gas -- that contribute to air pollution and global warming. Consider the views of William Nordhaus, a Yale economics professor who has studied the Swedish nuclear industry for Resources for the Future, a middle-of-the-road environmental research group.</p>
        <p>''Nuclear power is a long way from coming back,'' he said. ''But if you are really serious about coming to grips with global warming, nuclear or some other yet-to-be-proven technology needs to play a role.''</p>
        <p>But for nuclear power to have even a modest revival, it must do more than overcome public fears about safety -- both in operations and disposal of radioactive waste. Far more important, new nuclear plants must compete economically against other power sources. And that won't be easy.</p>
        <p>Despite the electricity deregulation fiasco in California, the power industry has largely abandoned its traditional approach -- in which utility monopolies, after approval by state regulators, built their own power plants under a guarantee that users would cover the full costs. Now, most new electricity sources -- from midsize gas-fired generators to clusters of windmills -- are built by outside producers, essentially on spec.</p>
        <p>Under these conditions, no one is prepared to take the risk of sinking billions of dollars into the kind of huge reactors, capable of powering a million homes or so, that were built in the 1960's and 70's. And rightly so. ''To order a new nuclear plant today,'' said Robert D. Glynn Jr., the chairman of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric in San Francisco, ''you'd have to be crazy.''</p>
        <p>Around the world, construction of nuclear plants has practically ground to a halt. No utility in the United States has ordered a nuclear plant in a quarter-century; dozens that were on the drawing boards have been canceled. Even in France, where nuclear power has long been favored by the government, no new reactors are on order.</p>
        <p>''I almost have to laugh when Cheney says environmentalists are out of touch with reality,'' said Christopher Flavin, president of the Worldwatch Institute, an environmental advocacy group in Washington. ''He's the one basically trying to reverse history. Yet in the meantime, the power industry has moved from a centralized to a decentralized model. Those who think nuclear power can make a comeback are the ones who are being naïve and unrealistic.''</p>
        <p>Supporters of nuclear energy pin their hopes on a new approach, known as the pebble-bed modular reactor, that is supposed to be safer, cheaper and faster to build and roughly one-tenth the size of the current generation of light water nuclear plants.</p>
        <p>''We recognize that these new generation plants, if they are to succeed, will have to compete on the basis of cost -- without subsidies,'' said Elizabeth A. Moler, a top Energy Department official in the Clinton administration and now a senior vice president at the Exelon Corporation, a large energy company that operates 17 nuclear power plants.</p>
        <p>WHILE it will take years for changes in nuclear technology to get off the ground, perhaps it is time to start putting that thinking to the test. Environmentalists like Mr. Flavin say nuclear power will fail in a truly open market. It will have to compete, he said, not only with the many new midsize power plants that will run on natural gas but also with the proliferation of ''micropower'' devices -- solar cells, wind turbines, fuel cells and the like -- that can rely on renewable energy sources.</p>
        <p>The environmentalists may be right. But either way, some counterweights to the nation's -- and the world's -- excessive dependence on fossil fuels are clearly needed. Such balances would not only lessen risks from global warming, but would also limit the economic damage at the times when oil and gas become more expensive.</p>
        <p>''There's too much inflexibility in the whole energy system,'' said Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. ''As it stands now, we're making a big bet on natural gas. It's a good bet, but we need some other bets, too.''</p>
