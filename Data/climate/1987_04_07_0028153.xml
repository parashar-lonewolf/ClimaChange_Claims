        <p>LEAD: President Reagan said today that he had ''agreed to consider'' a proposal by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney that Canada and the United States negotiate a ''bilateral accord'' controlling acid rain.</p>
        <p>President Reagan said today that he had ''agreed to consider'' a proposal by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney that Canada and the United States negotiate a ''bilateral accord'' controlling acid rain.</p>
        <p>The comment by the President, made at the end of a speech in Ottawa to the Canadian Parliament, marked a concession by Mr. Reagan to insistent Canadian demands that he take the acid-rain problem more seriously. But Mr. Reagan did not give details of what the accord would contain. Some Canadians Doubtful</p>
        <p>Mr. Mulroney responded with obvious pleasure to Mr. Reagan's statement, but other Canadians expressed doubts that any agreement would produce the cuts in chemically charged precipitation that experts in Canada have long sought.  [ Page A16. ]  In his speech in Parliament, the President received tumultuous applause when he praised Prime Minister Mulroney's proposal for a free-trade agreement between the two countries.</p>
        <p>''We shall commit ourselves and the resources of our Administration to good-faith negotiations that will make this visionary proposal a reality,'' the President said. ''And on this, the Canadian people and the Members of Parliament have my word.'' A 'New Determination'</p>
        <p>Speaking with reporters on Air Force One returning to Washington, Mr. Reagan's chief of staff, Howard H. Baker Jr., said the President's remarks on acid rain reflected a ''new determination'' by the White House to deal with the issue. But it was unclear tonight whether the President's concessions would be sufficient to meet Canadian demands and ease the political pressures on Mr. Mulroney to show progress on the acid-rain issue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baker acknowledged that many problems still remained between the two countries on the acid-rain issue and that the President's comments today did not resolve any of the underlying disagreements between the two countries. ''It will be a very difficult negotiation,'' Mr. Baker said.</p>
        <p>At the end of his speech in Parliament, the President also inserted a response to Canadian demands that the United States recognize Canadian sovereignty over the Arctic. The President said the two leaders had a ''full discussion'' of the issue and had agreed ''to inject new impetus'' into talks already under way.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baker said the United States was moving toward a recognition of Canadian claims in the Arctic, but he repeated Administration arguments that American rights of free transit would have to be respected in any agreement.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Mulroney has staked much of his political prestige on concluding a free-trade pact with Washington, and Congress has set a deadline of October for concluding those talks.</p>
        <p>In praising this initiative, Mr. Reagan said today that ''our free-trade discussions'' would be ''a model of cooperation to the world.''</p>
        <p>This was Mr. Reagan's first trip outside the United States since the Iran-contra affair emerged in November, and he used the occasion to stress some of his favorite themes, including the power of free enterprise to cure economic ills around the world.</p>
        <p>''The economic freedoms that open the door to prosperity - they are the hope and, we trust, the destiny of mankind,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But the President was not warmly received when he argued that his Strategic Defense Initiative, or ''Star Wars'' space-defense program, ''supports and advances the objectives of arms control.''</p>
        <p>One voice in the Parliament chamber in Ottawa called out, ''No way!''</p>
        <p>The protests were even more raucous when Mr. Reagan said the Soviet Union was ''threatening destabilization throughout Central America'' and repeated American opposition to the Nicaraguan regime.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reagan said he had been hearing ''hopeful talk of change'' from Moscow in recent months. He mentioned the release of political prisoners and a freer flow of information, and he added, ''We welcome these positive signs and hope they are only the first steps toward a true liberalization of Soviet society.''</p>
        <p>But he added that he was disappointed at the Soviet Union's continuing pursuit of a ''terrible war'' in Afghanistan and its support for leftist insurgencies in other countries.</p>
        <p>Acid rain, however, was the leading subject of his visit to Canada, and Mr. Mulroney pressed the issue during his two days of meetings with the President. And in his introduction of Mr. Reagan to Parliament, the Prime Minister called for a ''firm bilateral accord that would provide a North American solution to acid rain.''</p>
        <p>Acid rain is caused by emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Once released into the atmosphere, these substances can be carried long distances by prevailing winds. When the environment cannot neutralize the acid being deposited by rain, snow or dust, damage can occur to lakes, forests and wildlife. The main sources of sulfur dioxide emissions in North America are coal-fired power stations and ore smelters.</p>
        <p>The Reagan Administration has consistently argued that no limits could be set on the sulfur-dioxide emissions that cause acid rain because more research needs to be done on the causes, and the cure, of the problem.</p>
        <p>Last month, the Administration asked Congress for $2.5 billion over the next five to finance research into cleaner ways of burning coal.</p>
        <p>But the Administration viewpoint has been severely criticized, not only in Canada but also on Capitol Hill.</p>
        <p>Any mandating specific limits on sulfur-dioxide emissions could have a major impact on many industries.</p>
