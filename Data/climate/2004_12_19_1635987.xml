        <p>For New York's Newcomers, Help From Neediest Cases  For immigrants like Yu Xian Gu and her husband Cheng Wei Wang, The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund lends a hand with everything from housing to language barriers to cutting red tape.</p>
        <p>PAGE 32</p>
        <p>U.S. Limiting Global Talks on Greenhouse Gases  A United Nations conference on climate change ended with a weak pledge to start limited talks to slow global warming. Many nations and environmental groups worry about a lack of U.S. support for emissions curbs.</p>
        <p>PAGE 16</p>
        <p>Congo Fears a Return to War  Fierce fighting in Congo's eastern region between government troops and rebels has raised fears of a renewal of the warfare that started there in August 1998. Some 3.8 million people died in that conflict, a new survey indicates.</p>
        <p>PAGE 3</p>
        <p>More Arrests in Huge Fire  Three more people have been arrested in a Maryland arson case with $10 million in damage.</p>
        <p>PAGE 35</p>
        <p>Old Spaces, New Schools  Schools in New York City are popping up in the most unexpected places, like an old salami factory in the Bronx and a shuttered department store in Harlem.</p>
