        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Malaria Makes a Comeback, and Is More Deadly Than Ever'' (front page, Jan. 8) captures the multiple factors -- population movements, chemical resistance, lapsed public health vigilance and environmental change -- influencing the resurgence of malaria. Mosquitoes, the transmitters of the disease, are indeed quintessential opportunists and adapt readily in disturbed environments.</p>
        <p>As co-author of the World Health Organization report discussed in your article, I offer several recent findings. Consistent with model projections that global warming could hasten the geographic spread of malaria and dengue fever, these devastating diseases are now occurring at high altitudes in Latin America, central Africa and Asia. Cerebral malaria has occurred in Nairobi, Kenya, while dengue fever is found in the mountains around San Jose, Costa Rica.</p>
        <p>Moreover, highland malaria and dengue fever are occurring in the context of upward migration of plants on many continents and summit glacial retreat in Latin America, Europe, central Africa and Asia. A recent study in the journal Nature confirmed that the freezing levels in the mountains have indeed shifted upward about 500 feet since 1970, representing a warming of close to 2 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
        <p>As we enter a year of debate concerning climate change (the convention will be held in Kyoto, Japan, in  December), it is prudent to examine the potential consequences associated with continued warming and climate instability. Your article says that malaria ''hinders economic development''; epidemics are growing ever more costly in terms of health, development, trade and tourism.</p>
        <p>While the resurgence of infectious disease has multiple social, biological and environmental roots, meteorological factors may play an increasing role in the future. We may be vastly underestimating the social and economic damages associated with epidemics and extreme weather events as well as the potential benefits to society as a whole of changing our environmental and energy policies.</p>
