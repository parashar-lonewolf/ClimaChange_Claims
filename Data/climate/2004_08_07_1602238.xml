        <p>California gave some ground to the auto industry on Friday in its ambitious plan to regulate global warming emissions from tailpipes, but the state is unlikely to avert a legal challenge from carmakers.</p>
        <p>Under the revised plan, which would start to take effect in the 2009 model year, the industry would have eight years instead of six to reduce global warming emissions by about 30 percent. The changes to the plan were disclosed in the final draft of a staff report released Friday by the California Air Resources Board.</p>
        <p>The plan could still be changed further because it now requires the approval of the 11-member board, which will conduct a hearing next month to make a decision on its staff's recommendations.</p>
        <p>The plan is being closely watched by automakers around the world because it would have the effect of making them sell far more fuel-efficient vehicles in the nation's biggest market, California, after years of relying on Congressional allies to stall efforts to make cars more efficient nationwide.</p>
        <p>And Northeastern states, including New York, are likely to follow California if its plan stands up to legal challenges.</p>
        <p>General Motors, one of the last two automakers based in the United States, faces the toughest challenge in complying with the plan, the board indicated in its staff report. One reason is that G.M., which relies on sales of pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, makes the heaviest vehicles, on average, of the major automakers.</p>
        <p>''It's going to take several days to digest this and be able to react,'' said Dave Barthmuss, a spokesman for G.M. in California. The report is 251 pages long.</p>
        <p>Jerry Martin, a spokesman for the air board, said the change to the plan was an effort to help the industry comply.</p>
        <p>''This is a result of their input,'' he said. ''They operate on three-and-a-half to four-year cycles of building cars, and this better reflects those cycles. I don't know if they can support it, but just this change alone is favorable to them.''</p>
        <p>Environmentalists strongly support the measure as a way to reduce emissions linked to global climate change from a major contributor -- cars and trucks -- at a time when sales of big pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles continue to thrive despite high gasoline prices.</p>
        <p>''While we don't think the delay is necessary, this is still a reasonable, feasible proposal that is critical to drive new, cleaner technologies to market,'' said Roland Hwang, the vehicles policy director of the Natural Resources Defense Council.</p>
        <p>Automakers oppose the measure because it would be expensive and because they do not like the idea of states setting their own rules. In the new report, the board's staff increased its cost estimate, when the plan is fully phased in, to an additional $626 for the average car or small truck, up from $561. The increase for larger sport utility vehicles and other trucks would be $955, up from an earlier estimate of $871.</p>
        <p>But because the vehicles are far more efficient, they will also use less gas.</p>
        <p>''These increased costs will be more than offset by operating cost savings over the lifetime of the vehicle,'' the report says.</p>
        <p>California has long had authority to set its own air quality rules because its regulations predated the federal Clean Air Act. In addition, other states have the option of following California's rules instead of those of the federal government.</p>
        <p>The debate over global warming and cars is complicated because there is no filter that can reduce those emissions, in the way that a catalytic converter can reduce tailpipe emissions of tiny particles that cause smog.</p>
        <p>A lawsuit is widely expected from the industry, on the grounds that federal fuel economy regulations supersede California's authority to regulate global warming gases, like carbon dioxide, that are linked to climate change.</p>
        <p>Eron Shosteck, a spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, said in a statement, ''Automakers will review A.R.B.'s final staff proposal to address its technical feasibility, economic impact and cost effectiveness, as well as to examine the final proposal in light of the federal pre-emption issue.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Martin, the air board spokesman, said: ''This rule is designed to reduce emissions from motor vehicles of greenhouse gases. It is not a fuel economy standard.''</p>
        <p>Though the Bush administration has opposed global efforts to regulate global warming emissions, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is also a Republican, has said he supports California's emissions plan. And he has kept in place Alan C. Lloyd, the chairman of the air board, who was appointed by Mr. Schwarzenegger's predecessor, Gray Davis, a Democrat.</p>
