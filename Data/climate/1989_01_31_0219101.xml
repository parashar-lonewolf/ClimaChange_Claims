        <p>LEAD: Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d called today for international political action to counter the threat of global warming caused by pollutants.</p>
        <p>Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d called today for international political action to counter the threat of global warming caused by pollutants.</p>
        <p>Speaking at the opening meeting of a 17-nation working group formed to develop policies to deal with the problem, Mr. Baker said that ''the political ecology is now ripe for action.'' It was his first diplomatic meeting since being confirmed.</p>
        <p>While scientists still must ''refine the state of our knowledge'' about the causes and effects of the threat, Mr. Baker said, ''we can probably not afford to wait until all of the uncertainties have been resolved before we do act.''</p>
        <p>''Time will not make the problem go away,'' he said. Signal by New Administration</p>
        <p>State Department officials said Mr. Baker chose this gathering for his first formal appearance since his confirmation last week as Secretary to signal that the Bush Administration was placing the problem of global warming and climate change high on its agenda. Mr. Baker's call for rapid action differed from the Reagan Administration's approach, which had emphasized the need for more research before acting.</p>
        <p>But in a meeting closed to reporters after Mr. Baker's opening statement, American officials proposed a plan to respond to the threat that would require more efforts to collect data.</p>
        <p>Observers at the meeting characterized the plan as time-consuming and in conflict with Mr. Baker's call for action. Members from other countries also said the American proposals would take too much time, the observers said.</p>
        <p>The working group appointed a seven-nation panel to look at all the options.</p>
        <p>Private observers said they believed that the apparent discrepancy between the views expressed by Mr. Baker and the proposals later offered occurred because midlevel officials, most of whom had been working on policy positions in the Reagan Administration, had not yet incorporated the new Adminstration's views.</p>
        <p>The rising diplomatic interest in global warming reflects the wide acceptance among scientists of the theory of the greenhouse effect. The theory holds that a buildup in the atmosphere of carbon dioxide and certain other gases will cause the earth's surface to warm. The gases trap infrared radiation from the sun, much as a greenhouse retains heat.</p>
        <p>Current climate models predict that average global temperatures will rise by several degrees Fahrenheit in the next century. The warming is expected to cause major changes in climate patterns as well as a rise in sea level as heat causes the oceans to expand and glaciers to melt. Disagreement on Start of Trend</p>
        <p>While many scientists believe that major climate changes are virtually inevitable, there is disagreement on when the warming will appear. Some experts cite global temperature data suggesting that a warming trend is already under way. But a study released last week of temperatures in the 48 contiguous United States over the last century found no signs of an upward trend.</p>
        <p>Joseph Goffman, a senior attorney who attended the meeting for the Environmental Defense Fund, a private environmental group, said: ''Secretary Baker's statement was very important and seemed completely consistent with what George Bush said during his campaign. But the work plan proposed by the bureaucracy sounded like it was proposed by a completely different government.''</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview late today, a State Department spokesman said that ''we would not characterize the comments of the other nations on the U.S. approach as criticism.'' The American proposals, he said, would be considered by the seven-nation panel along with other alternatives.</p>
        <p>The spokesman declined to comment on whether the proposals by the United States contradicted Mr. Baker's call for quick international action on global warming.</p>
        <p>One private observer attending today's meeting said the proposals by the United States were, in effect, a call for more delay, and represented ''an artifact of the Reagan Administration.''</p>
        <p>The members of the group appointed delegates from the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, China, the Netherlands, Australia and Zimbabwe to draft a statement on goals and procedures for the working group. One of Three Groups</p>
        <p>The group is one of three groups formed under the auspices of the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Program as part of an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The other groups were formed to look at the science of global warming and the potential effects of such warming.</p>
        <p>The findings and recommendations of the Working Group on the Response to Global Warming are to be presented at an international conference on the world climate scheduled for 1990. A treaty for international action to meet the threat of global warming could emerge from that conference.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baker said that while scientists seek more information about global warming, policy makers should now ''focus immediately on prudent steps that are already justified on grounds other than climate change.''</p>
        <p>Such steps, he said, would include steeper cuts than now planned in the production of chlorofluorcarbons, which are industrial chemicals that are believed to contribute to global warming as well as to the depletion of the ozone layer that protects the earth from ultraviolet radiation from the sun.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baker called for greater efficiency in the use of energy to reduce consumption of fossil fuels. He also urged an effort to plant more trees, which absorb carbon dioxide.</p>
