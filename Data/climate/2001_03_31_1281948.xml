        <p>An international conference here ended in disagreement today after the United States declined to go along with a Latin American-backed call for industrialized countries to reduce their emissions of the heat-trapping gases blamed for global warming.</p>
        <p>The division was a further reflection of the gap that has emerged between the United States and leading allies over the issue since the Bush administration made clear its opposition to the Kyoto accord of 1997, the most far-reaching international treaty on the effort to address climate change.</p>
        <p>Senior delegates to the gathering, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said American representatives who tried to smooth over the disagreement had been unable to win approval of a compromise statement that would have stopped short of a call for  specific action.</p>
        <p>But most Latin American representatives issued a statement of their own calling for industrialized countries to ''engage in an effort to reduce their domestic emissions of greenhouse gases.''</p>
        <p>In a news conference at the end of the two-day gathering, a meeting of environment ministers from the Western Hemisphere, David Anderson, the Canadian environment minister, said that there had been general recognition of a need to reduce greenhouse gases but that ''there was not total consensus among ministers that we were able to reflect in the final communiqu√©.''</p>
        <p>The Kyoto Protocol, signed by the United States and 100 other countries but not yet ratified by any industrialized nation, would require industrialized countries to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases 5 percent to 7 percent below 1990 levels by 2012. The Bush administration, saying that such reductions would be too costly and that in any case developing countries should be bound by similar obligations, has made clear that it has no interest in carrying out the accord and will seek to develop alternative proposals.</p>
        <p>Christie Whitman, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, had headed the American delegation here, but she left the conference on Thursday afternoon, leaving her seat to be filled by subordinates.</p>
        <p>Delegates said Canada had been among a handful of countries that indicated a willingness to go along with the compromise language proposed by the United States, even though senior Canadian officials had expressed deep disappointment with the American position.</p>
        <p>Canadian officials argued that the United States was not the only one to blame for the current discord. They noted that Europe's refusal to accept an American-backed proposal allowing the trading of emissions reductions had led to the breakdown of efforts at The Hague last November to forge an agreement that might have brought the Kyoto Protocol's ratification, and by extension to the Bush administration's decision to abandon any support for the treaty.</p>
        <p>''Europe adopted a position they knew would force the United States to pull out,'' said Mr. Anderson, the Canadian environment minister. ''This is going to be an ongoing struggle.''</p>
