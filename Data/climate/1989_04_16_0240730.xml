        <p>LEAD: IN LESS THAN TWO DECADES, DERMATOLOGY has undergone a striking metamorphosis from what was once regarded as the lowly field of cosmetic medicine into one of the frontiers of medical science. Seemingly intractable mysteries of skin physiology are unraveling; once-untreatable conditions are succumbing to potent new medications, and preventive medicine is assuming great prominence in battling skin diseases.</p>
        <p>IN LESS THAN TWO DECADES, DERMATOLOGY has undergone a striking metamorphosis from what was once regarded as the lowly field of cosmetic medicine into one of the frontiers of medical science. Seemingly intractable mysteries of skin physiology are unraveling; once-untreatable conditions are succumbing to potent new medications, and preventive medicine is assuming great prominence in battling skin diseases. In perhaps the most exciting development, scientists are beginning to explore the role the skin plays in shielding people from such disorders as allergies, cancer and possibly even AIDS. Experimental treatments are emerging that seem to cause even the deadliest form of skin cancer to regress.</p>
        <p>Monthly, the medical journals report on rapid-fire advances. ''A doctor who doesn't read the journals for four months is hopelessly lost,'' says Dr. Albert M. Kligman, a dermatologist at the University of Pennsylvania. ''A doctor who doesn't read for one year is 20 years behind.''</p>
        <p>The common thread running through most of the new therapies is the premise - still unproven - that the best way to control skin disorders is to attack them at the earliest stages of their development. This premise was strengthened at the American Academy of Dermatology's annual meeting last December when scientists reported that the drug Retin-A prevents certain precancerous lesions from turning into skin cancer.</p>
        <p>The most talked-about medications resulting from the dermatology revolution are aimed at acne, wrinkles and hair loss. Retin-A, a staple of acne treatment, is now also prescribed to diminish wrinkles. The powerful drug Accutane clears the skin of severe acne. Rogaine, also known as minoxidil, has shown modest success in stimulating hair growth.</p>
        <p>''Skin and science have found each other,'' says Dr. James J. Leyden, another dermatologist at the University of Pennsylvania. ''A nucleus of researchers, new techniques and technologies inevitably yields better treatment.'' Scientists are quick to point out that, because the treatments are all relatively new, little is known about their long-term side effects. The research to date indicates that the drugs are safe if properly used, but that they can lead to serious medical problems if they are not used as prescribed.</p>
        <p>SCIENTISTS HAVE BECOME TANTALIZED by the skin's undercover operations, which hold the keys to the mechanisms of skin diseases, as well as wrinkling and balding. The skin, the body's largest organ, is also one of its most complex - a vast protective wrapper that prevents fluids from escaping, maintains body temperature and performs many other functions.</p>
        <p>The outer layer, or epidermis, which consists largely of tissue cells called keratinocytes, is no thicker than a sheet of paper. But it is charged with crucial tasks. Beneath the surface, which is nothing but dead cells, is a factory teeming with biochemical activity. Immune-system operatives called Langerhans' cells ensnare and help fight off allergens, bacteria, viruses and other foreign proteins that happen to get under the skin. Other epidermal cells known as melanocytes are the body's natural defense against skin cancer. Melanocytes manufacture pigment, which gives both the skin and the hair their color. Pigment cells help block damaging ultraviolet light from penetrating the skin. The darker a person's skin is, the less likely it is to burn.</p>
        <p>Most troubling cosmetic skin conditions, including wrinkles, baldness and acne, originate in the middle, and thickest, layer of the skin -the dermis. And this is where many of the new skin drugs do their work. The dermis consists mostly of collagen, a network of interlocking protein fibers that makes the skin firm. Threaded through the collagen is elastin, another fibrous protein, which makes the skin resilient. With age, collagen and elastin deteriorate, and in some places the dermis literally caves in. These depressions show up on the surface of the skin as wrinkles.</p>
        <p>Poking out from the web of collagen and elastin are hair shafts. Hair - which, like the visible part of the skin, is composed of dead cells - performs a variety of functions, not the least of which is to make people sexually appealing. In both men and women, hair growth is regulated by male hormones. Most forms of male baldness are hereditary, and are thought to occur when a derivative of one male hormone, testosterone, causes certain hair follicles to shrink so much that hair can no longer grow in them.</p>
        <p>Alongside the hair follicles are oil glands, which lubricate the hair. When these glands produce too much oil, or sebum, dead cells clump together and clog the pores. The bottleneck of oil that forms behind such obstructions causes the walls of the oil duct to bulge. The result is a pimple. Like baldness, acne is associated with male hormones, in this case, an overabundance of the hormones that stimulate oil production.</p>
        <p>Beneath the dermis lies the skin's third layer, known as subcutaneous fatty tissue, which serves as both a shock absorber against blows to the skin and an insulator that helps maintain body temperature. With age, the fatty tissue wastes away, leaving a person more vulnerable to skin injuries and more sensitive to the cold.</p>
        <p>ABOUT HALF A CENTURY ago, scientists began to understand how these skin functions sometimes break down, and what could be done about it. A group of researchers in Boston were studying the skin tissue of rats deprived of vitamin A, a fat-soluble compound found in a variety of foods, such as egg yolks, butter or carrots and other vegetables. When they examined the skin under a microscope, they noticed that the subsurface tissue was scaly, with clumped cells that resembled the dead cells of the epidermis. Then, as if by magic, the researchers reversed this damage in just a few weeks by adding vitamin A back into the rats' diets. Thus, it was obvious that vitamin A was crucial to the skin's health.</p>
        <p>This discovery led to the successes that are now being achieved in the treatment of various skin conditions. In 1969, Dr. Kligman at the University of Pennsylvania reported that retinoic acid, a vitamin A derivative, helped control acne by preventing dead skin cells from clustering in the pores. This finding would soon revolutionize the treatment of acne. In 1971, the Food and Drug Administration approved the sale of retinoic acid as a prescription drug for acne under the name Retin-A.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kligman is regarded by many of his colleagues as an irreverent genius who sometimes jumps the gun on science, announcing conclusions before they are borne out in the laboratory. But his pronouncements are often confirmed by other researchers. Such was the case with his discovery that Retin-A could smooth out wrinkles. In the course of treating acne patients in their 20's and older with the drug, Dr. Kligman noticed a highly desirable side effect: It seemed to diminish some of the signs of aging. Wrinkles became shallower, liver spots faded, the skin was softer.</p>
        <p>Retin-A's power to make the skin look younger was confirmed scientifically last year by Dr. John J. Voorhees and his colleagues at the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor. In a four-month study, Retin-A had a noticeable, if subtle, effect on wrinkles - particularly fine wrinkles - as well as liver spots and other imperfections associated with sun exposure. The results were less dramatic, however, on deep wrinkles such as furrows in the brow and lines running from the nose down to the corners of the mouth. The only adverse side effects found in the Michigan study were redness of the skin and an increased tendency to get sunburned, neither of which was considered serious enough for most participants to discontinue treatment. The redness generally disappeared within a few weeks, and sunburn was prevented with sunscreens.</p>
        <p>Retin-A's effectiveness as an anti-aging preparation was firmly substantiated by a 22-month follow-up study presented by Dr. Voorhees last December at the American Academy of Dermatology's annual meeting in Washington. ''The clinical changes were very, very impressive,'' says Dr. Barbara A. Gilchrest, chairman of the dermatology department at the Boston University School of Medicine. ''I found them very convincing.''</p>
        <p>Despite all the evidence that Retin-A, which is applied directly to the skin, works, doctors are not sure exactly how. They do know that it alters skin physiology. Unlike over-the-counter creams, which remain largely in the epidermis, Retin-A - a prescription drug even when used against wrinkles - penetrates deep into the dermis, where it increases the rate at which new skin cells form. It is believed to speed up the production of collagen and elastin as well, and to promote the growth of new capillaries. There is also evidence that Retin-A inhibits the production of pigment granules, or melanosomes, within the melanocytes. One theory is that exposure to the sun leads to an overabundance of melanosomes, which then cluster, causing liver spots and other discolorations to form on the surface of the skin. All of these changes combine to leave the skin firmer, smoother, rosier and more even in tone.</p>
        <p>A lingering question is whether people who use Retin-A for wrinkles must use it for life. Follow-up studies on people who have stopped using the drug have not been done, according to Dr. Voorhees. But researchers assume that some wrinkles and other imperfections will eventually return. Consequently, some doctors hesitate to prescribe the drug for purely cosmetic purposes until its long-term effects have been determined.</p>
        <p>Dr. Stuart H. Yuspa, a researcher at the National Cancer Institute, says that he would not recommend using Retin-A for wrinkles until more is known about its side effects, particularly with regard to sun-sensitivity. The general consensus among dermatologists, however, is that the drug is safe, even when used for many years. Their confidence is based in large measure on the fact that so little of the medication passes from the skin into the bloodstream.</p>
        <p>Skin experts still believe that the best defense against wrinkles is to avoid the sun as much as possible. And they agree that everyone should use a good sunscreen when outdoors for any length of time. Were people to establish such prudent habits as children, they might have no need for Retin-A later in life.</p>
        <p>SUFFERING THROUGH acne once seemed a rite of passage on the road to adulthood, but over the past two decades, Retin-A has eased that suffering considerably. Indeed, some dermatologists now feel that it is best to treat acne-prone children with Retin-A even before they show the first sign of the disease, though there is controversy on the subject. Dr. Kligman believes that early treatment can stop acne in its tracks, sparing adolescents psychic pain, embarrassment and disfigurement.</p>
        <p>In his office at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital, Dr. Kligman shows a visitor strips of porous plastic that he developed to be pressed onto the foreheads, noses, cheeks and chins of porcelain-skinned children as young as 7 years old. After three hours these strips, which have become maps of the skin's oil-gland activity, are removed and studied. On the basis of the information they provide, Dr. Kligman is able to select children who might benefit from early therapy.</p>
        <p>If a child's oil glands are unusually active, and if at least one parent had acne, chances are high that the child too will develop the condition. Dr. Kligman has given Retin-A to dozens of acne-prone children, who are supposed to use the drug daily until they are past adolescence. Although he has not yet published his findings, he says the results are encouraging. ''I know that if I can get hold of kids early enough, I can stop their acne,'' he says.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sidney Hurwitz, a pediatric dermatologist at the Yale School of Medicine, agrees. By beginning treatment at an early age, ''you can get one step ahead of acne,'' he says. While he has started children as young as 5 on Retin-A, he always waits for mild acne to be visible before beginning treatment, and he sometimes starts with less potent medications.</p>
        <p>Building on the success of Retin-A, Dr. Gary L. Peck, a dermatologist at N.C.I., began experimenting in 1976 with a more potent oral retinoid, Accutane. The drug proved far more effective against acne than any other medication, although, as with Retin-A, he and other scientists did not understand how it worked. In 1982, the F.D.A. approved the sale of Accutane by prescription, and in the years that followed, it was so successful in treating cystic acne, the severest and most disfiguring form of the disease, that for the first time some doctors began using the word ''cure.''</p>
        <p>But a year ago, the praises for Accutane were obscured by controversy. An F.D.A. advisory panel conservatively estimated that between l982 and l986, 600 babies were born with serious birth defects as a result of their mothers' using Accutane during pregnancy. The panel's findings confirmed a 1985 report published in The New England Journal of Medicine. The report said that in terms of the rate and severity of the birth defects it causes, Accutane is as dangerous as Thalidomide, a sedative prescribed for pregnant women roughly 30 years ago. Accutane's label warned doctors that pregnant women should not use the drug, but some women, perhaps not realizing that they were pregnant, used it anyway.</p>
        <p>To address this problem, the F.D.A. directed Accutane's manufacturer, Roche Dermatologics, a division of Hoffmann-La Roche, to strengthen the warning on packages of the drug. The agency also advised doctors not to prescribe Accutane to women of childbearing age unless they have severe cystic acne that does not respond to other treatments, and suggested that they inform these patients of the risks. Should the women wish to use the drug anyway, they should first sign a consent form stating that they understand its side effects, and then have a pregnancy test performed by a doctor. (Roche Dermatologics has volunteered to pay for the test.) If the test is negative, treatment can begin on either the second or third day of the next menstrual period.</p>
        <p>Many medical experts believe that these measures are inadequate because they place responsibility on the patient rather than on the physician. They point to the F.D.A.'s own estimate that physicians overprescribe the drug, and argue that its use should be greatly restricted. In Britain, Sweden and other European countries where regulations on the use of Accutane are more stringent than they are here, the number of birth defects related to the drug is much lower. With this in mind, Public Citizen Health Research Group, a consumer organization, has petitioned the F.D.A. to limit the use of Accutane by allowing only dermatologists to prescribe it (any physician can now do so) and by prohibiting them from giving it to women of childbearing age for mild cases of acne.</p>
        <p>In the wake of the dispute over Accutane, Roche Dermatologics has been testing a topical form of the drug, called Isotrex. Dermatologists who have studied Isotrex characterize it as far less effective than Accutane and comparable to Retin-A. But they say Isotrex is better than Retin-A in one crucial respect: It doesn't cause irritation.</p>
        <p>LIKE RETIN-A AND ACCUTANE, Rogaine, the first drug that has proved effective in growing hair on balding heads, was greeted with tremendous enthusiasm when it came on the market last summer. Rogaine contains a medicine called minoxidil, which, taken orally, has been used for years to treat hypertension. Some patients who took minoxidil in pill form experienced a highly undesirable side effect: They grew hair, not just on the head, but on the back, chest, arms and face. The Upjohn Company, the manufacturer of the drug, soon realized that if this side effect could be controlled, it would be far from undesirable for the 30 million men and 20 million women plagued by thinning hair. By 1983, Upjohn had formulated Rogaine -which is applied topically rather than taken in pill form - and was testing it at 27 medical centers around the country.</p>
        <p>There is no question that Rogaine works. After about five months of applying it twice a day to their scalps, many men notice sparse but pronounced hair growth. Scientists think Rogaine counteracts baldness by increasing blood flow to the hair follicles.</p>
        <p>But Rogaine has several drawbacks. Chief among them is that it produces moderate to dense hair growth for only 39 percent of the users. The best candidates for treatment among men are those under 40 who have just started to lose their hair and whose baldness occurs only at the crown. It is virtually useless for men who are completely bald, those with receding hairlines and those with hair loss at the temples. Not enough is known about Rogaine's effectiveness on women to determine who will benefit most, although studies completed by Upjohn last December indicate that the drug works at least as well for women as for men.</p>
        <p>Another major drawback is that to maintain even modest results, men and probably women must use the drug for life. Otherwise, the new hair falls out. The prospect of using Rogaine for many decades concerns some physicians and patients, because its long-term side effects are not known. When taken orally for hypertension, minoxidil can sometimes cause difficulty breathing, rapid heartbeat, fainting and vomiting. When applied to the skin, however, only small amounts of minoxidil are absorbed into the bloodstream, and itching and dryness of the scalp appear to be the only side effects. Nonetheless, on the chance that Rogaine could be harmful to people with heart disease, Upjohn recommends that doctors consider the risks of oral minoxidil before prescribing Rogaine to such people.</p>
        <p>Even for people who initially benefit from Rogaine, there is uncertainty about its long-term value. The few studies that are ongoing indicate that after a year, hair growth usually stops and the drug merely slows the rate at which hair is lost. But a four-year study by Dr. Robert Rietschel, associate chairman of the department of dermatology at the Ochsner Clinic in New Orleans, found that Rogaine continued to stimulate hair growth in about a third of the participants. Other researchers believe that Rogaine's results, no matter how long they last, are disappointing. Dr. Norman Orentreich, a Manhattan dermatologist who pioneered hair-transplant techniques and who has studied topical preparations of minoxidil, says that ''hair growth was rarely cosmetically acceptable.''</p>
        <p>Despite the uncertainties about Rogaine, most dermatologists agree that the development of the drug is a milestone, both because of its ability to stimulate hair growth and retard hair loss and, perhaps more important, because it indicates that scientists are beginning to understand hair growth and regrowth. Whether the results obtained with Rogaine are sufficient to warrant a lifetime commitment at the cost of up to $100 a month, in addition to periodic visits to a dermatologist, is up to individual users to decide. Dr. Orentreich predicts that drugs that can counteract the effects of the male hormones that actually trigger baldness are likely to produce better results than Rogaine. But Rogaine marks the crucial first step in proving that hair loss can be stopped. ''It has opened a door and let a little light in,'' he says.</p>
        <p>NO ASPECT OF the new research on skin is more vital than the strides being made against skin cancer. This year, about 527,000 people will develop the disease, according to the American Cancer Society, and for 8,200 of them, it will be fatal. Currently, the predominant treatment for skin cancer is surgery and, in the most severe cases, topical chemotherapy. But a variety of new approaches show promise in controlling stubborn cases of skin cancer and even preventing the disease.</p>
        <p>In the course of studying Retin-A and Accutane, researchers have found that both drugs can reverse some kinds of skin cancer. Last August, Dr. John J. DiGiovanna, an investigator in the dermatology branch at N.C.I., published the first controlled study demonstrating that Accutane can decrease the likelihood that people who are genetically susceptible to two kinds of skin cancer - basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas - will develop the disease. And last December, 10 medical centers published a report indicating that Retin-A eliminates certain kinds of precancerous lesions, called actinic keratoses, and prevents most of those that remain from turning into basal cell carcinomas.</p>
        <p>The apparent effectiveness of Retin-A and Accutane in combating skin cancer fits neatly into a larger puzzle that scientists have been piecing together. Epidemiological studies have linked various kinds of cancer to vitamin A deficiency, leading scientists to wonder whether a diet high in vitamin A can help prevent the disease. Studies are under way to determine whether it is worthwhile for people who are exceptionally prone to skin cancer to take vitamin A supplements, Accutane or Retin-A.</p>
        <p>Another strategy for preventing skin cancer involves powerful new sunscreens. Most cases of skin cancer are caused by the sun's ultraviolet rays, and 80 percent of the damage caused by the sun is believed to occur during short exposures - taking a walk around the block, for instance, or having lunch at an outdoor cafe. The incidence of malignant melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, is increasing faster than that of any other type of cancer, and melanoma is striking more and more people under age 39. Doctors attribute this rise almost exclusively to sun exposure. To compound the problem, scientists expect that all types of skin cancer will become more prevalent as the sun-blocking ozone layer of the earth's atmosphere deteriorates. Thus it would seem that the best approach to preventing the disease would be to shield the skin from ultraviolet light. The best sunscreens are those with a seal of recommendation from the Skin Cancer Foundation.</p>
        <p>At the University of Arizona, Dr's. Victor Hruby and Mac Hadley are working on a tanning medicine that would stimulate the production of melanin, a pigment that helps prevent sunburn and therefore cancer by absorbing ultraviolet light. Normally, the body makes extra melanin in response to ultraviolet-light exposure as a means of protecting itself. This extra melanin turns the skin darker. The tanning medicine would boost melanin production without ultraviolet light. ''We'd like to have a pill that people could take before they go skiing in the winter or go to the beach in the summer,'' says Dr. Hruby. ''They could get enough of a tan to protect themselves, or use the pill to deepen a tan for further protection.'' The two researchers have already made a synthetic version of the hormone that stimulates melanin production and incorporated it into a tan-promoting lotion that is being tested in clinical trials. Another kind of suntan lotion being developed commercially uses genetically-engineered melanin to block ultraviolet light.</p>
        <p>The most ambitious approaches to conquering skin cancer involve bolstering the immune system. The prospect of immunizing people against melanoma is not as unrealistic as it might seem. Researchers have developed a vaccine that can prevent the disease in mice, and they hope eventually to develop one that can prevent it in humans. For now, scientists are testing various vaccines on melanoma patients in an attempt to stimulate their immune systems enough to make the cancer regress. The vaccines, which are made from melanoma cells, are able to trigger an immune response in about half the patients. ''We must and can do better,'' says Dr. Jean-Claude Bystryn, director of the melanoma program at New York University's Kaplan Cancer Center. ''The idea is to make a vaccine that's more potent and is also safe.''</p>
        <p>Last year, Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg, chief of surgery at N.C.I., reported encouraging results with another kind of immune-system therapy against melanoma. He removed white blood cells called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes from melanoma patients, cultured the cells in the laboratory and injected the expanded army of these lymphocytes into the patients, along with interleuken-2, a genetically-engineered immune-system protein that is being tested against various forms of cancer in advanced stages. Two groups of melanoma patients were studied. One had previously taken interleuken-2 and not responded to it, and the other had never taken it. The melanoma regressed in 40 percent of the patients who had failed to respond to interleuken-2 and in 60 percent of the other patients.</p>
        <p>AS SOME SCIENTISTS look to the immune system for ways to overcome skin cancer, others are looking to the skin for help in fighting AIDS and other immune-system diseases. The skin is not an illogical place to look for clues to the progression of AIDS, because AIDS patients often develop skin conditions such as warts, psoriasis and the rare skin cancer Kaposi's sarcoma.</p>
        <p>In 1983, while studying immune-system cells in the skin, Dr. Donald V. Belsito, an associate professor of dermatology at New York University Medical Center, discovered that in AIDS patients the number and function of Langerhans' cells is markedly depressed, establishing another important link between the AIDS virus and the breakdown of the immune system. (It was already known that the virus attacks and kills T-cells, immune-system cells circulating in the blood.) In l987, European researchers made a major breakthrough. They found that the AIDS virus could lie dormant and reproduce in the Langerhans' cells in the skin for a period of time before symptoms of the disease appear - just when and how is still unclear. ''The idea that the virus can replicate in cells without destroying them was new,'' says Dr. Belsito, adding that ''the Langerhans' cells act as a reservoir in which the virus can go undetected by the rest of the immune system.'' Although the virus lives in the skin, a person cannot get the disease by touching the skin of someone with AIDS.</p>
        <p>Last year, Dr. Belsito embarked on a long-term study of people who have tested positive for the AIDS virus but do not have the disease. He is studying what happens to the Langerhans' cells once the AIDS virus moves in, how the virus behaves there and why it doesn't lie dormant within these cells indefinitely. ''I want to know what makes the virus eventually come pouring out to produce AIDS,'' he says.</p>
        <p>Dr. Belsito thinks it is likely that dermatology will play a key role in AIDS research and in the development of drugs to fight the disease. Human skin is already a valuable research tool because it is so accessible: Scientists can obtain skin cells using relatively painless techniques. ''If the Langerhans' cells are a major reservoir for the AIDS virus,'' he says, ''we can take some cells from the skin, infect them with the virus and culture them with a drug to assess how well the drug inhibits the virus from spreading.''</p>
        <p>Human skin, long thought of as little more than an innocuous thin wrapper, is proving every bit as interesting and important to our health as the goods inside.</p>
