        <p>Democrats in Congress Push for Climate Bills  Democrats in Congress are increasingly determined to impose mandatory controls on carbon dioxide emissions by smokestack industries, wresting control of the issue from the White House. Four major Democratic measures have been announced, and lobbyists expected one or a blend of them to pass this year or next.</p>
        <p>PAGE A24</p>
        <p>Cancer Deaths Down For Second Straight Year  The number of cancer deaths in the United States has dropped for the second year in a row, the American Cancer Society reported. The finding suggests that the small drop reported last year -- the first in more than 70 years -- was not merely a statistical fluke, the researchers said.</p>

        <p>Turning a Museum's Walls Into Wide Screens  Doug Aitken's monumental video projection piece, ''Sleepwalkers,'' turns the Museum of Modern Art's sleek exterior into a postmodern screen for the house that Cubism built. A review by Roberta Smith.</p>

        <p>Senator Clinton Backs Limits  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, back from Iraq, said she wanted limits on the White House's handling of the war. Three other senators proposed a resolution against a troop increase in Iraq.</p>

        <p>A Place on the Shelf  Americans are personalizing their space even after death with cremation urns designed by artists and craftspeople, like the textured steel urn, left, by Tony Knapp of Seattle.</p>
