        <p>IT'S probably not what the Drifters had in mind when their hit ''Under the Boardwalk'' turned these seaside esplanades into icons of summer romance. But through the efforts of two high school seniors and a tiny nonprofit Brooklyn group called Rainforest Relief, Long Island's boardwalks are being built of anything but the rare tropical hardwood that is commonly used along waterfronts elsewhere.</p>
        <p>With varying degrees of success, Rainforest Relief has prodded the administrators of Long Island's boardwalks to abandon plans for using wood that the group says comes from harmful logging operations. Two municipalities, Long Beach and Greenport, have adopted ordinances barring their agencies from buying wood that environmentalists object to.</p>
        <p>Tropical deforestation is said to contribute to global warming, a strong reason for alternative materials. And state and local government agencies would also prefer that plastics be recycled -- used in waterfront structures, for example -- instead of ending up in landfills.</p>
        <p>Long Beach officials and Rainforest Relief credited Amanda Kofman and Nechama Levy, 17, who were seniors at the Hebrew Academy of Long Beach, with persuading the Long Beach City Council to pass its environmental ordinance.</p>
        <p>The students brushed up on legalese, learned how to write a press release, sought guidance from Rainforest Relief and visited City Hall just about every day to lobby for  their cause. ''We just didn't have a very good understanding of the way the whole thing worked when we started,'' said Ms. Levy, who lives in Roslyn Heights.</p>
        <p>Getting the ordinance passed was their senior class project. The ordinance, adopted earlier this month, bars the city agencies from buying wood from tropical or temperate rain forests unless ''they are proven to have been harvested in an environmentally sound manner,'' language that Long Beach officials said was close to what the students  submitted.</p>
        <p>Councilman Ed Buscemi was the students' point man. Tim Keating, the executive director of Rainforest Relief's executive director, said that Mr. Buscemi was almost too enthusiastic about the ordinance.  ''He wanted to introduce it at a council meeting right after they met, but you really want to lay a little more groundwork before you just jump in,'' Mr. Keating said.</p>
        <p>But the councilman took ill, forcing the students to begin again. They found their  key supporter in Ed Eaton, the Long Beach city manager. ''They appealed to the environmentalist in me,'' Mr. Eaton said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Eaton was no stranger to the issue. The city manager said that Rainforest Relief influenced him two years ago when Long Beach was considering using tropical hardwood to replace weathered planks in its oceanfront boardwalk. The city had used such wood on a walkway that runs along Reynolds Channel.</p>
        <p>The tropical hardwood in question is mostly ipê, the common Portuguese name for the wood of seven species found in Brazilian and Bolivian forests. Ipê's strength and alluring reddish brown color have made it popular for waterfront projects and home decks. The wood is so dense that it won't even take a stain, and on boardwalks, it is strong enough to support  the biggest garbage trucks.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, Mr. Keating said he sent Mr. Eaton a 13-page rebuttal to sales materials from a supplier of tropical hardwood.  This prompted Mr. Eaton to seek alternatives, and Long Beach has since installed two boardwalk access ramps, both made of plastic planks from recycled consumer waste like milk jugs. One is at the western end and one in the middle of its 2.2-mile boardwalk. The city is also swapping wooden benches for plastic.</p>
        <p>Most of Long Beach's boardwalk is made of Southern yellow pine, a domestic softwood, and it is common to see city workers replacing weather-beaten planks each summer. ''The challenge is, Southern yellow pine doesn't have a very long useful life,'' Mr. Eaton said. ''Some of the tropical hardwoods last 40 or 50 years, but those aren't the companies we want to deal with. Recycled plastic doesn't splinter, and it's rather impervious to the weather, so you may be seeing more of that on the boardwalk.''</p>
        <p>The recycled plastic is nearly three times as expensive as domestic wood, but Mr. Eaton said its durability -- it lasts five times as long as Southern pine -- made it worth the investment. About five years ago, the city experimented with boardwalk planks made of a composite of sawdust and plastic called Trex that eventually crumbled, Mr. Eaton said, so the city is now buying the  newer plastic materials piecemeal as a test.</p>
        <p>Sometimes the chemicals used to treat lumber pose a problem, and waterfront communities like Amityville, Brightwaters and Moriches  solved it by using Trimax, a plastic and fiberglass composite, for bulkheads and boardwalks.</p>
        <p>Trimax replaced wood treated with arsenic and other chemicals meant to protect it from marine borers. ''The motivation was not to have chemically treated materials in sensitive areas where you're trying to grow beach grasses,'' said Anthony Noto, a former Town of Babylon supervisor who used to run the Trimax company, which is now owned by U.S. Plastic Lumber of Boca Raton, Fla.</p>
        <p>In Greenport, village officials are testing a relatively untried concept by buying tropical hardwood from trees felled during the construction of a reservoir in Brazil, along the Amazon. The wood, salvaged from underwater, will be used to complete a boardwalk started in the first phase of the village's $10 million  Mitchell Park and marina project, which opened this summer along Peconic Bay.</p>
        <p>Greenport adopted a pro-environment stance in a village resolution two years ago, but not before Mr. Keating of Rainforest Relief said he and local environmentalists protested the first phase of the Greenport waterfront plan. The project's 280-foot-long boardwalk and a building housing a carousel contain roughly 8,000 square feet of ipê, which cost $77,000.</p>
        <p>The rest of the boardwalk will use 3,764 square feet of ipê salvaged from the reservoir, said William Sharples, an architect hired by Greenport for the Mitchell Park project. The salvaged ipê will cost $30,000.</p>
        <p>The Mitchell Park walkway turned a ''beautiful gray'' because it was not oiled to retain its original color, the architect said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Keating and other environmentalists viewed the early stages of Mitchell Park through a different lens. ''It was pretty much an environmental mess as far as we were concerned,'' he said. ''The only reason we walked away from that situation without further protest -- because we would have blocked the bulldozers -- was because of the agreement that they would be certified on the next phases.''</p>
        <p>David Kapell, Greenport's mayor, contends that the village's intentions were good from the start. He said that Greenport initially bid for wood  certified not to have come from threatened forests through the Forest Stewardship Council in Oaxaca, Mexico, a nonprofit group widely recognized by environmental groups.</p>
        <p>Timber Holdings, a Milwaukee company that is Greenport's supplier, tried to buy certified wood for the village, which was prepared to pay an additional $30,000 for it, Mayor Kapell said. ''When it came close to the time for actually starting to build, the material was not available,'' he said.</p>
        <p>State parks officials said that they also used South American ipê but that they had been told that that wood came from reforested tracts of land. They added that they try to use a mix of woods, deploying tough ipê sparingly on the midsections of  boardwalk that get the heaviest traffic. In some areas, they are testing plastic similar to that used for picnic tables at Jones Beach State Park.</p>
