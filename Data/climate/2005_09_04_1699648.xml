        <p>Babies cried. The sick huddled in the shade in wheelchairs or rested on cots. Dawn Ray, 40, was in tears, looking after an autistic niece who had soiled herself and her son who is blind and has cerebral palsy. A few others, less patient, simply started walking west with nowhere to go, like a man pushing a bike in one hand and pulling a shopping cart in another. But most just waited with resigned patience -- sad, angry, incredulous, scared, exhausted, people who seemed as discarded as the bottles of water and food containers that littered the ground.</p>
        <p>''Disease, germs,'' one woman, Claudette Paul, said, covering her mouth with a cloth, her voice smoldering with anger. ''We need help. We don't live like this in America.''</p>
        <p>New Orleans has always existed in a delicate balance between land and water, chaos and order, black and white, the very rich and the very poor. It has been the lacy ironwork of French Quarter balconies, the magical shops and galleries on Royal Street and the magisterial cuisine not just at Galatoire's or Mr. B's or Commander's Palace but also at humble po-boy joints and neighborhood restaurants in every part of town.</p>
        <p>But it has also been a place of crushing poverty, of dreary housing projects and failing schools, where crime and violence have been an incessant shadow in daily life, as much a part of the local sensibility as the smothering blanket of heat and humidity.</p>
        <p>This week, bit by bit, that delicate balance came completely undone. Water took over earth when levees broke, putting 80 percent of the city under water. The mix of fatalism and bravado that allowed the city's biggest fear -- a killer hurricane -- to become the marquee drink of Bourbon Street gave way to terror and despair and horrifying spasms of looting and violence. New Orleans became unrecognizable not just physically, but psychologically as well. Faced with a disaster of biblical proportions, everything fell apart, and government was either overmatched or slow to the task.</p>
        <p>The flood-control apparatus, which government officials and scientists had long said was inadequate, gave way, but federal engineers did not even realize that a major breach had occurred until the next morning, when citizens began reporting rising flows on Web logs. The city's evacuation plan worked, except for the thousands who were too poor or disabled to find their own way out of the city before the storm. The radios and cellphones that officials and police officers use to communicate failed, erasing any remaining semblance of authority in a city beset by chaos and crime. And finally, a full federal response came only after the dialogue between local and federal officials devolved into anger.</p>
        <p>Just two months ago, further evidence emerged that the city and its levees were sinking, increasing the risk of a catastrophic flood, even as federal money to protect the city was being cut afresh. As flood waters rose on Tuesday, Senator Mary L. Landrieu tried to impress upon colleagues in Washington that this was America's tsunami, but she said that the more she pleaded, the more she felt she was not being heard. Most local officials who were supposed to be running the city eventually left, mainly because they could not communicate with the outside world, whose help they desperately needed. It took four days for National Guard troops to arrive to restore order as looting and lawlessness spiraled out of control.</p>
        <p>Mayor C. Ray Nagin said federal aid began flowing after he spoke by telephone to President Bush and told him bluntly: ''Man, this is a mess, and I am not getting the resources I need. I need help, and if I don't get the help I need this city is going to blow up and this is going to be a national disgrace.''</p>
        <p>New Orleans, Flannery O'Connor once wrote, is a place where the devil's existence is freely recognized.</p>
        <p>But not this devil. Not the devil of bloated bodies floating in muddy waters washing lazily over submerged pickups and campers, of corpses being eaten by rats as they decomposed on city streets, of people dying in wheelchairs outside the convention center as friends poured water over their heads to try to keep them alive.</p>
        <p>Not the devil who left Bill and Gail Orris sitting exhausted, dazed after escaping through the hole they poked through the roof of their home in nearby Chalmette, while their 20-year-old daughter, Lennie, unable to walk and mentally disabled, sucked her thumb and jerked spasmodically back and forth in her wheelchair in the hot sun.</p>
        <p>Not the devil who left Catherine Weiss, at 75, apologizing profusely for not having her teeth with her -- she had left in a hurry, after all, when the water filled her house like a bathtub -- and panicked about what had happened to her nephew, Michael Phillippello, who collapsed as a boat ferried them across the river to safety.</p>
        <p>Not the man on talk radio, stranded in his house but begging people not to try to come back to see what they had left behind.</p>
        <p>''It's like the five stages of accepting death,'' he said. ''First, I was thinking if I had enough ice to save the good shrimp and tilapia, then it's whether I can save the house, now it's about my life. If I had two AK's I'd feel safe here. As it is, someone could pop me off, and I could end up bloated, no one would check for bullet holes, and I'd just end up in some potter's field. You can feel human life kind of receding like the waters.''</p>
        <p>The storm that brought those waters began as Tropical Depression 12, yet another swirl of tropical turbulence in the southeastern Bahamas. But at each step of the way Hurricane Katrina seemed to overachieve. It hit Florida with more power than expected, killing nine people and knocking out electricity for a million more. Then it crossed back into the Gulf of Mexico, intensifying into one of the strongest storms on record as, in a horrific bit of timing, it churned directly over the ''loop current,'' a great, deep whorl of tropics-hot seawater that pulses in between the Yucatán and Cuba each year and then stays south of Louisiana into late summer. Often, storms weaken as they suck up cool water that lies stratified beneath the warm surface. But in the loop, even the depths are hot.</p>
        <p>''We are facing a storm that most of us have long feared,'' said Mayor Nagin, who urged people on Saturday to leave town and then gave an evacuation order on Sunday, when it looked as if a Category 5 storm, with winds as high as 175 miles an hour, could be headed for New Orleans. ''This is a once-in-a-lifetime event.''</p>
        <p>Many of the 1.3 million people in the metropolitan area did that. But, as always, many did not. This surprised exactly no one. In a 2003 Louisiana State University poll, 31 percent of New Orleans residents said they would stay in the city even if a Category 4 hurricane struck.</p>
        <p>Many stayed because they felt they had no choice.</p>
        <p>The survey found that those who said they would stay tended be poor, less educated, disabled, older, childless or isolated, or had lived in the city for a long period. Twenty-eight percent of the population of New Orleans lives below the poverty line, compared with 9 percent nationwide, according to census figures. Twenty-four percent of its adults are disabled, compared with 19 percent nationwide. An estimated 50,000 households in New Orleans do not have cars.</p>
        <p>And there was another bit of bad timing: the hurricane came at the end of the month, when those depending on public assistance are waiting for their next checks, typically mailed on the first of every month.</p>
        <p>''They wouldn't have had any money to evacuate,'' said Councilwoman Cynthia Hedge-Morrell.</p>
        <p>Experts disagreed on whether there were adequate evacuation plans for those most in need. Brian Wolshon, an L.S.U. civil engineering professor who consulted on the state evacuation plan, said the city relied almost entirely on a ''Good Samaritan scenario,'' in which residents would check on elderly and disabled neighbors and drive them out of the city if necessary.</p>
        <p>Planning was stymied by a shortage of buses, he said. As many as 2,000 buses, far more than New Orleans possessed, would be needed to evacuate an estimated 100,000 elderly and disabled people.</p>
        <p>But Chester Wilmot, an L.S.U. civil engineering professor who studies evacuation plans, said the city successfully improvised. He said witnesses described seeing city buses shuttle residents to the Superdome before Hurricane Katrina struck.</p>
        <p>''What I've heard is that there were buses, but they weren't very well utilized,'' Professor Wilmot said. ''They literally carried very few people."</p>
        <p>The two professors agreed that the evacuation of New Orleans residents with cars went well. They said a new ''contraflow plan,'' which used all lanes of I-10 for outbound traffic, avoided the kind of traffic that snarled during a voluntary evacuation of the city during Hurricane Ivan in 2001.</p>
        <p>''What you're going to find is that everyone who wanted to get out, got out,'' said Professor Wolshon. ''Except for the people who didn't have access to transportation.''</p>
        <p>But many other stayed because they wanted to stay. Because their friends were staying. Because they were worried about looters if they left. Because they felt they could protect their property by staying home. They stayed because they had elderly parents who were going to stay, because they thought they knew which parts of the city flooded and which did not. Or because they always had.</p>
        <p>''Hard-headed, honey,'' said Mrs. Weiss, when asked why she rode out the storm in the same brick home where she has stayed for storms for 41 years. ''From now on, I'm leaving for a tropical storm.''</p>
        <p>And then there were the tourists, many of whom came with only the haziest sense of what they were facing and not the slightest idea of what they should do. When Chris and Tammy Distefano, Kris and Mike Miller and Chad and Michelle Toomey arrived from York, Pa., on Saturday morning for their first trip to New Orleans, they asked the limo driver, Joseph, what to expect. Not much, he answered. The storms always went somewhere else. He took them on a tour and dropped them off at their hotel. They dropped off their bags and walked over to Pat O'Brien's for a hurricane, the mix of dark rum, passion fruit and other juices that people drink from plastic cups as they tour the French Quarter. They were scared to death as the storm rattled their hotel, shutting off the power, Sunday night and Monday morning.</p>
        <p>But as Monday rolled into afternoon and the storm moved west, people peeked outside to find streets battered, trees down, roots torn up, but the city mostly dry. It looked like the N'awlins luck had held again.</p>
        <p>Thriving on Bluff</p>
        <p>And why not? For generations -- centuries, really -- this city had thrived in part on the poker-hand bluff, its sheer allure masking its starker realities.</p>
        <p>Eighteenth-century accounts sent back to France as the first settlers carved into the Mississippi silt focused on the fanciful, not the real, said Craig E. Colten, a geographer at L.S.U. and the author of a new book on the city, ''An Unnatural Metropolis.''</p>
        <p>Few entrepreneurs seeking to sell the idea of building a town on this swampy island mention that as they dug into the earth, they came upon recently buried tree trunks -- a sign that they were standing on land laid down by epic floods.</p>
        <p>And as the city grew, wedged between the Mississippi River and the broad, shallow Lake Pontchartrain, so too did efforts to ring it with earthen levees. But the very expansion of the city contributed to the rising flood risk, Dr. Colten said. As swampier spots were drained, the drying soil compressed, causing reclaimed land to sink ever more.</p>
        <p>In the 20th century, more land was drained as the city's legendary system of pump stations and purging canals spread. But that made it sink all that much faster.</p>
        <p>Hurricanes feeding on warmth from the gulf rumbled by most summers. Some potent ones smashed other Gulf Coast towns, like Galveston, Tex., in 1900, and storms in 1947 and 1965, struck New Orleans directly, but with survivable intensity. Hurricane Betsy, in September 1965, finally spurred a federal hurricane protection plan for Lake Pontchartrain and vicinity.</p>
        <p>But the system that emerged was a compromise from the start, cut back by competing Army Corps of Engineer projects, by pressure from local communities that had to pay part of the tab, and by the tendency to focus more on current costs than on future risks.</p>
        <p>Officials settled on a system of levees sufficient to protect against another Hurricane Betsy -- roughly akin to what is now called a Category 3 storm, the kind that statistics estimate might strike New Orleans once in 200 years.</p>
        <p>A lull in Atlantic hurricane frequency from around 1970 until 1995 probably contributed to complacency, said Bob Sheets, a former director of the National Hurricane Center.</p>
        <p>But more recently, a string of studies found that after 1995, a natural Atlantic cycle had switched from the pattern that stifles storms to one that nurtured them. Other studies pointed to an eventual increase in storm intensity from global warming.</p>
        <p>Computer simulations showed ever more clearly how New Orleans could swamp like a low boat in high seas under the assault from certain hurricanes.</p>
        <p>Still, the compromises over flood protection persisted. After a scare from Hurricane Georges in 1998, Congress authorized the Corps of Engineers to begin studying bolstering the city's defenses against a Category 5 storm. But money for that study, and simply for finishing the last components of the original plan to protect against a Category 3 storm, dribbled in district at a fraction of annual requests.</p>
        <p>In 2004, with insufficient money to close contracts with the companies doing the work, Alfred Naomi, a senior district project manager, told the local East Jefferson Levee Authority, according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune: ''The system is in great shape, but the levees are sinking. Everything is sinking, and if we don't get the money fast enough to raise them, then we can't stay ahead of the settlement.''</p>
        <p>This year, the New Orleans district was hit by a $71.2 million cut. Without more federal money, the district reported in May, the raising of various levees and other ''pressing needs'' would not be met. In June, at a meeting of emergency planners and hurricane experts, Roy Dokka, an L.S.U. engineer who has spent much of his career refining measurements of elevations around the gulf, presented findings that parts of the coast and New Orleans were sinking 2 to 50 times faster than earlier estimates.</p>
        <p>Many spots were two to four feet lower than anyone thought, recalled Stephen Baig, a National Hurricane Center meteorologist, a chilling hint that calculations of the flood potential of particular storms, and the vulnerability of levees, might be significantly underestimated.</p>
        <p>''For levee heights, and for our models,'' Dr. Baig recalled, ''that could mean the difference between overtopping and not overtopping.''</p>
        <p>On Monday, there was nothing dramatic when the levee failed, no sound of an explosion or a crash. At midday, as the storm was blowing out of the city, the Web site of The Times-Picayune quoted residents near the 17th Street canal saying that after experiencing only minor flooding from the storm, suddenly the water in their yards was rising from what seemed to be a breach in the canal. One man said later that afternoon that the water was rising one brick on his house every 20 minutes.</p>
        <p>By 4:20 p.m. on Monday, the Web site reported that the water had already rolled through the nearby Lakeview neighborhood and on down to the center of the city. By then, the water in Lakeview had reached the second stories of many houses. The berms along Lake Pontchartrain had held. The problem was in canals that had been built to carry water pumped from city drains out to the lake. But on Monday, with the lake rising, the flow in the canals reversed.</p>
        <p>A surge, probably 10 feet above normal, flowed in from the lake, rising until it began cascading over the top of the sleek, butter-colored walls that stood between the east side of the 17th Street Canal and the city's Bucktown neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Greg Breerwood, a deputy district engineer for the Corps, said it appeared that as the weight of the water pressed on the high part of the wall, the water pouring over the top hit the ground on the other side and ate away at the soil supporting its base.</p>
        <p>A section of the wall pushed in and the rush of water turned that breach into a gash as broad as a football field is long. The lake and below-sea-level city were becoming one body of water.</p>
        <p>''We heard about the flood wall failing,'' Mr. Breerwood said. ''Then we realized there was an open corridor to the city.''</p>
        <p>A Reluctance to Leave</p>
        <p>Once the levee broke, most long-time New Orleanians knew that the city could unravel quickly, with nothing to stop the lake from pouring into neighborhoods that were still dry and surging across a huge city park and into downtown.</p>
        <p>Ms. Landrieu, a Democrat who grew up in New Orleans, whose father, Moon Landrieu, had been mayor, whose brother, Mitch, is currently Louisiana's lieutenant governor, was at the federal and state command center in Baton Rouge when the first warnings about the break flashed on Monday afternoon.</p>
        <p>Ms. Landrieu knew how reluctant people could be to leave. This was the first time her own father had ever left during a hurricane. She said in an interview that she knew instantly that thousands who thought they had survived the storm would now be trapped in their houses, racing the rising floodwaters to their second floors, or to their attics or rooftops.</p>
        <p>But she and other local officials suddenly faced a new problem: convincing federal officials that just one break in one canal with such a mundane name could bring on a cataclysm.</p>
        <p>''I have been with Michael Brown since the minute he landed in this center,'' Ms. Landrieu said Friday in Baton Rouge, referring to the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, ''and I have been telling him from the moment he arrived about the urgency of the situation.''</p>
        <p>But, she said, ''I just have to tell you that he had a difficult time understanding the enormity of the task before us.''</p>
        <p>Natalie Rule, a spokeswoman for FEMA, disputed Ms. Landrieu's account. ''There was no doubt in our minds that a Category 3, 4 or 5 headed for New Orleans was going to be dangerous,'' Ms. Rule said. She said agency officials told state and local leaders: ''We will be there for you. You just go for it. We've got your back.''</p>
        <p>But if they did, no one knew it. And as the flood-control system broke down, so soon did everything else.</p>
        <p>There was no immediate announcement that the levee had been breeched or what it meant, but different people realized at different times that maybe the bullet had not been dodged, after all. The prestorm evacuation, as chaotic as it seemed to anyone stuck on the road, was still part of a plan. Now , a whole new ad hoc stage began.</p>
        <p>The tourists from York ventured out Monday to see gangs of youths, maybe four, then a dozen, then another four, breaking into the Canal Place Mall, home to high-dollar retailers like Saks and Gucci, Brooks Brothers and Ann Taylor. Worried that things were slipping out of control, they managed to make a plane reservation at $637 a ticket to get out of town. A local family staying at the hotel drove them out for $100 a head, the best money they ever spent. There had been no plans for what to do with stranded tourists, and before long, the hotels were closing down.</p>
        <p>With the Superdome overloaded and without food or air-conditioning, the hotels guided visitors to the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center, a huge rectangular building that stretches about a mile and is several hundred yards wide. It has been used for conventions with more than 70,000 people. But soon the situation there devolved into anarchy, too, to the point that officials, often circumspect and cagey with the news media, were just the opposite.</p>
        <p>''The tourists are walking around there and as soon as these individuals see them, they're being preyed upon,'' said P. Edwin Compass III, superintendent of police. ''They are beating, they are raping them in the streets.''</p>
        <p>The Flooded Ninth</p>
        <p>Before dawn on Tuesday, Ms. Landrieu's brother, the lieutenant governor, and Sgt. Troy McConnell of the state police left Baton Rouge to assist in the rescue of flooded residents of the Ninth Ward in New Orleans. Mr. Landrieu knew the city intimately. But now he was navigating the Lower Ninth Ward not by car, but by boat. The four men on board would cut the engine and float in watery silence, listening for calls for help from inside houses or attics.</p>
        <p>People yelled from rooftops or waved shirts or rags, as if they were flags, from vents in the attic. A few wooden houses floated like buoys.</p>
        <p>It had become so hot inside the fetid houses that some residents shivered in the cold water as they swam to the rescue boat. One woman was so heavy and immobile that 12 men were needed to lift her off a gurney.</p>
        <p>They must have rescued 100 people, but by the end of the day the mood began to change to one of irritated impatience. ''By dusk, people were getting agitated and upset,'' Sergeant McConnell said. ''They had been in those houses for two days with nothing to eat or drink.''</p>
        <p>Soon there was a small army of evacuees, refugees with no place to go who were deposited on the island of dry land at the edge of I-10 in Metairie. During the long, hot afternoon and into the humid night, the crowd swelled to 2,000 hungry, flood-weary people, residents of the northern neighborhoods of New Orleans and of St. Bernard Parish to the northeast who had been plucked from their roofs and attics.</p>
        <p>Barefoot women cradling naked, screaming babies limped from a National Guard rescue truck, everything they owned on their backs after 36 hours of watching the floodwaters breach their doors, topple their refrigerators and drive them to the only high ground available -- roofs, trees, attics and bridge spans. Behind them, elderly couples in nightgowns and slippers leaned on each other for support as they walked slowly from the helicopter that rescued them. Many clutched garbage bags holding all the possessions they could salvage; many had no more than damp tank tops and shorts clinging to their bodies. Most were hungry, thirsty and alone.</p>
        <p>Chermaine Daniels, 49, had left her flooded one-story house in the Ninth Ward on Tuesday morning, gashing her ankle on a fence as she struggled to swim to a neighbor's two-story house. Later that day, Ms. Daniels and several others were rescued by a uniformed officer in a boat and deposited at an I-10 encampment.</p>
        <p>''What do we do now?'' she asked the boat driver.</p>
        <p>''You're on your own,'' the driver replied.</p>
        <p>An Array of Complaints</p>
        <p>Increasingly, local officials also felt that they were on their own.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday night, Mayor Nagin complained that while federal officials had agreed that morning that stemming the flow from the breach was the highest priority, ''it didn't get done.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Landrieu said she had talked to Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader, on Tuesday and told him: '''You remember when I flew over the tsunami with you? This was worse than anything we saw.' He said, 'No, you've got to be kidding.' I said, 'I know it's hard to grasp.' And he said, 'We're on it.''' Mr. Frist's office did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
        <p>By Wednesday, with little visible response from the federal government, Ms. Landrieu said that she talked to FEMA officials. ''I started to sense they were thinking I was a little overwrought, that maybe I was exaggerating a little bit,'' she said. When she pressed Mr. Brown on when he was going to finally get buses to pick up the people who had been trapped at the Superdome, ''he just mumbled,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mayor Nagin said that he could not remember whether he spoke to President Bush on Wednesday or Thursday, but that the president acknowledged the federal government could have done more and promised to fix the situation.</p>
        <p>By then, the state leaders also had an array of complaints. People were infuriated about the lack of National Guard troops to keep order and end the looting. How could the Corps of Engineers, which builds and takes care of the levees, have not had a contingency plan for dealing with a levee breach, especially in such a critical spot? And each time another federal agency offered to help, FEMA seemed to delay in providing guarantees that it would reimburse them later.</p>
        <p>For instance, a defense agency had packages of communications gear ready to deploy and held them while awaiting FEMA's approval, according to two congressional aides.</p>
        <p>Inside New Orleans, city officials were trying to keep some semblance of control over their city, and failing. The most basic reason was a massive breakdown of the communications system. Cellphones failed and satellite phones did not arrive for several days, according to Representative Charlie Melancon, a Democrat who represents suburban New Orleans.</p>
        <p>Ms. Landrieu said on Wednesday: ''Our communications systems are not functioning adequately; they are compromised. Not Louisiana's communications system. The United States of America. We didn't have the right communications system for 9/11. We don't have the right communications system now. By that I mean the simplest things. A police chief in a city talking to a mayor in a city wasn't happening while this was going on because their cellphones were down and their radios didn't communicate.''</p>
        <p>The flooded city was also becoming lawless. Even in better times, New Orleans has more than its share of crime, with one of the nation's highest big city murder rates. Now, as law enforcement was all but swept away by the storm, there were acts of desperation and acts of depravity.</p>
        <p>As water rose into his home on Tuesday, Louis Martin Sr., a 36-year-old truck driver, said he commandeered a flatbed truck to rescue his family from the second floor of a neighboring home. He then made several trips, ferrying neighbors to the convention center at the instructions of a police officer. By now the crowd there had reached about 25,000 people.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, Mr. Martin said, armed youths appeared when evacuation buses didn't. ''They had guns and they were looking for someone,'' he said. ''I saw two boys running. There were shots.''</p>
        <p>At the convention center, food and water grew scarce. Dead bodies sagged in wheelchairs. Residents reported hearing burst of sporadic gunfire. A number of city police officers walked off their jobs in despair.</p>
        <p>By Wednesday, many city officials left for Baton Rouge, mainly because they could not communicate with the outside world and they needed to work with federal and state leaders directing operations from the command center there, said Ms. Hedge-Morrell, the councilwoman. In Baton Rouge, she said, ''we could yell and scream and keep fussing at them.'' By Thursday, local officials were yelling and screaming in public.</p>
        <p>Col. Terry Ebbert, director of homeland security for New Orleans, complained that the whole recovery operation had been ''carried on the backs of the little guys for four goddamn days,'' and ''the rest of the goddamn nation can't get us any resources for security.'' He added, ''It's like FEMA has never been to a hurricane.''</p>
        <p>Finally, Hope</p>
        <p>Friday, for the first time, there was a dose of hope.</p>
        <p>President Bush's visit to New Orleans, where he met with Mayor Nagin, and to the rest of the tattered Gulf Coast region, helped calm some of the tensions. Referring to the federal emergency actions, Mr. Bush said: ''What is not working right, we're going to make it right.''</p>
        <p>The first sizable contingent of troops rolled into town and restored a measure of order to the convention center. There was food and water. There was a sense that maybe, things at least would stop getting worse.</p>
        <p>But at a time when the nation fears disaster as never before, there was a horrific view of how unprepared emergency preparedness can be.</p>
        <p>Louisiana's other United States senator, David Vitter, called FEMA's response completely dysfunctional, completely overwhelmed. He said the death toll might reach 10,000 unless the rescue is speeded up. ''Hopefully today is the turnaround, that is my prayer,'' Mr. Vitter, a Republican, told reporters traveling with Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>But this sense of expectancy dissipated at the causeway on I-10 where the crowd of refugees had swollen from about 2,500 to 5,000, according to Lt. Michael R. Field of the Louisiana State Police.</p>
        <p>''It's worse today,'' he said. ''It's not evacuating to move people from one part of the city to another. We need to get them out of this situation.'' ''</p>
        <p>Some of the sick were being helicoptered to a field hospital at the airport. But Dr. Alan Hinton, a surgeon volunteering his time, said it was difficult to tell who was most in need of help. ''There's no organization,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Jerome Wise, 46, who said he retired with a disability as a postal worker, tripped as he climbed out of a helicopter and shattered the one possession he had taken from his flooded home a framed family photograph. His wife and seven of his children were somewhere in Mississippi. His eighth child, Calvin Holmes, was with him. He had been born 19 years ago on this day, but there was not much to celebrate here.</p>
        <p>''Doesn't feel like a birthday,'' Mr. Holmes said.</p>
        <p>STORM AND CRISIS: A LOOK BACK</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 29, 2005, Thursday  An article on Sept. 15 about the National Football League's effort to create a home-field atmosphere for the New Orleans Saints misstated the name of the New Orleans police superintendent, who was to take part in the coin toss at a game with the New York Giants. (The error also occurred in numerous articles between Sept. 3 and Sept. 14.) The superintendent, who announced his retirement on Tuesday, is Edwin P. Compass III, not P. Edwin Compass III.</p>
