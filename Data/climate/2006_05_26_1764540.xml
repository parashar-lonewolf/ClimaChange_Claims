        <p>A citizens' watchdog group warned yesterday that Atlantic City, the Meadowlands, Cape May, Long Beach Island and the Delaware Bay shore could be submerged and that other areas would be prone to chronic flooding by 2100 if global warming continued at its current pace and sea levels rose by two to four feet. The group, the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group, used data from a 2005 report from Princeton University scientists, which suggested that 1 to 3 percent of the state would be submerged and 6 to 9 percent subject to chronic flooding. The group urged Gov. Jon S. Corzine to reduce global warming pollution by 20 percent below current levels by 2020 and 70 percent by 2050.</p>
