        <p>The warm spell that kept New Yorkers in shirt sleeves (until today) and gave the United States its second-warmest November and the planet its warmest October on record was caused by -- well, climate scientists cannot quite agree.</p>
        <p>In part, many say, the recent weather is simply a matter of ''the noise'' of natural variability, more of which is on the way: after a cold snap through tomorrow, it will warm up again next week, though only temporarily. Some forecasters say the country will see a big shift, including persistent cold and storms in the East, about a week before Christmas.</p>
        <p>In any event, many weather experts say, it would be a mistake -- even with yellow jackets still buzzing in backyards in the Northeast -- to link the recent mild temperatures to the long-term phenomenon of global warming.</p>
        <p>''The trend has definitely been for warmer years, so it's easy to be suspicious that having such temperatures is part of that trend,'' said Dr. Matthew A. Barlow, an associate research scientist at Columbia University's International Research Institute for Climate Prediction. ''But it's very difficult to separate when you're just getting a run of events versus something responding to a longer signal. Weather is often like flipping a coin. You're bound to get five heads in a row sometimes.''</p>
        <p>In recent years, computer models fed by data from satellites, buoys and weather balloons have done fairly well at ascribing incongruities in the weather to El Niño, a Pacific warming, or La Niña, a Pacific chill.  But the world is now in one of its in-between states, in which neither El Niño nor La Niña is present.</p>
        <p>The variation at this time of year becomes evident just by looking back to 2000, which saw a November-through-December stretch that was the coldest on record. Then, as now, the Niño and Niña patterns in the tropical Pacific were not in place, allowing more subtle influences on climate to take hold.</p>
        <p>The recent pattern has climatologists debating whether the influences responsible for it are coming from the Pacific or the Atlantic.</p>
        <p>Some say that the recent cool, stormy weather along the West Coast and the warm, dry spell in the East were probably shaped by a hot spot of water in the western Pacific -- near where the international date line crosses the Equator -- that comes and goes on a cycle of roughly 50 days called the Madden-Julian Oscillation.</p>
        <p>This cycle exerts a significant influence only when the bigger cycles are absent, said David Reynolds, a senior meteorologist at the federal Hydrometeorological Prediction Center in Camp Springs, Md. ''It tends to be a player in neutral years,'' Mr. Reynolds said. But its influence, he said, is much more difficult to forecast than those of other important ocean shifts.</p>
        <p>The current tropical hot spot, where sea surface temperatures are a steamy 86 degrees or so, seems to be fading, and that may explain why computer models are predicting a flip in North American conditions in about a week.</p>
        <p>Other experts, though, including Dr. Martin Visbeck, an associate professor at Columbia's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, say it is just as possible that the warm fall in the East has been influenced by a closer feature, in the Atlantic: an unusually strong zone of high pressure over the Azores that has caused the jet stream to shift northward and prevented cold snaps that typically frost windshields in the Northeast by now.</p>
        <p>''A strong high over the Azores doesn't allow cold outbreaks to come south out of Canada,'' Dr. Visbeck said. ''In November we certainly should have had a couple.''</p>
        <p>But what causes an intense Azores high? Until the science develops further, that question is unanswerable, he said.</p>
        <p>The biggest question, as always, is what is to come.</p>
        <p>In its latest outlook for conditions through February, the National Weather Service predicts abrupt swings in temperature and precipitation, with cold waves sweeping the South and the East and a decent string of northeasters along the Atlantic Coast. In other words, a ''normal'' winter is coming.</p>
        <p>This winter could be followed by a turbulent period. There are a lot of signs that after an unusually long hiatus of three years, the Pacific is getting ready for a Niño event, in which a great tongue of warm water spreads east toward South America, raising global temperatures, disrupting fisheries, spreading droughts in Southeast Asia and battering California with heavy storms.</p>
