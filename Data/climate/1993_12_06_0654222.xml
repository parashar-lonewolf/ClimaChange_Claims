        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Why do public policy advocates -- be it the North American Free Trade Agreement, health care reform, climate change options -- have to berate those citing obvious job losses as naysayers, even unpatriotic, when surely even if job gains in one city or state rise while others fall, there are job losses for a time and a place, and the people involved are hurt?</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Why do public policy advocates -- be it the North American Free Trade Agreement, health care reform, climate change options -- have to berate those citing obvious job losses as naysayers, even unpatriotic, when surely even if job gains in one city or state rise while others fall, there are job losses for a time and a place, and the people involved are hurt?</p>
        <p>Net statistics do not net out pain. Similarly, the short-run transitional pain is not sufficient per se to sink an otherwise societally good policy, even if that takes a while to materialize. But we do need to know about the transitional pain, have it acknowledged by everyone, and not discuss it cavalierly as a "retraining" problem.</p>
        <p>Who really retrains the skilled worker, the small-business owner, the middle manager? There's got to be more to meeting and dealing with this pain. Ultimate winners, if the societal good is worthwhile, need to pay up.</p>
        <p>As a jobs-impact forecaster for public policy options for almost three decades, I insist that those I advise know the truth about transitional effects: there should be no netting out of human pain!</p>
        <p>Conventional economic analyses of job impacts emphasize longer-term consequences, describing impacts broadly. Increasingly, analytic approaches provide a unique perspective to the evaluation of job impacts by focusing as well on the short-term and transitional effects on employment, particularly in the specific industries and geographic areas where jobs are most likely to be affected.</p>
        <p>Maybe the political process will grow up enough to be able to deal with the truth: there's never going to be a free-jobs lunch for new government policies, though many will ultimately bear fruit.  WILBUR A. STEGER  Pittsburgh, Nov. 25, 1993</p>
