        <p>Put celebrity environmental activists in a room with top Bush administration officials and a meeting of the minds could result. At least that is a theoretical possibility.</p>
        <p>The more likely outcome is that an argument will break out, as it did at the White House Correspondents' Association dinner on Saturday night between Karl Rove, the president's deputy chief of staff, and the singer Sheryl Crow and Laurie David, a major Democratic donor and a producer of the global warming documentary featuring Al Gore, ''An Inconvenient Truth.''</p>

        <p>Recriminations and finger-pointing continued the day after an argument over global warming between Sheryl Crow and Karl Rove.</p>

        <p>Put celebrity environmental activists in a room with top Bush administration officials and a meeting of the minds could result. At least that is a theoretical possibility.</p>
        <p>The more likely outcome is that an argument will break out, as it did at the White House Correspondents' Association dinner on Saturday night between Karl Rove, the president's deputy chief of staff, and the singer Sheryl Crow and Laurie David, a major Democratic donor and a producer of the global warming documentary featuring Al Gore, ''An Inconvenient Truth.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Crow and Ms. David, who have been visiting campuses in an event billed as the Stop Global Warming College Tour, approached Mr. Rove to urge him to take ''a fresh look'' at global warming, they said later.</p>
        <p>Recriminations between the celebrities and the White House carried over into Sunday, with Ms. Crow and Ms. David calling Mr. Rove ''a spoiled child throwing a tantrum'' and the White House criticizing their ''Hollywood histrionics.''</p>
        <p>''I honestly thought that I was going to change his mind, like, right there and then,'' Ms. David said Sunday, The Associated Press reported.</p>
        <p>Ms. Crow was at the dinner as a guest of Bloomberg News. Ms. David and her husband, Larry David, a creator of ''Seinfeld,'' were guests of CNN. Mr. Rove was a guest of The New York Times.</p>
        <p>The one thing all three parties agree on is that the conversation quickly became heated.</p>
        <p>As Ms. Crow and Ms. David described it on the Huffington Post Web site on Sunday, when Mr. Rove turned toward his table, Ms. Crow touched his arm and ''Karl swung around and spat, 'Don't touch me.' ''</p>
        <p>Both sides agreed that Ms. Crow told him, ''You can't speak to us like that, you work for us,'' to which Mr. Rove responded, ''I don't work for you, I work for the American people.'' Ms. Crow and Ms. David wrote that Ms. Crow shot back, ''We are the American people.''</p>
        <p>In their Web posting, Ms. Crow and Ms. David described Mr. Rove as responding with ''anger flaring,'' and as having ''exploded with even more venom'' as the argument continued.</p>
        <p>''She came over to insult me,'' Mr. Rove said Saturday night, ''and she succeeded.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rove did not respond to a request for comment on the women's Internet posting on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Tony Fratto, a White House spokesman said, ''We have respect for the opinions and passion that many people have for climate change.'' But, Mr. Fratto said, ''I wish the same respect was afforded to the president.''</p>
        <p>He accused Ms. Crow and Ms. David of ignoring the president's environmental initiatives, like pushing for alternative fuels, and for ''going after officials with misinformed assertions at a social dinner.''</p>
        <p>''It would be better,'' Mr. Fratto said, ''to set aside Hollywood histrionics and try to help with the problem instead of this baseless, and tasteless, finger pointing.''</p>
