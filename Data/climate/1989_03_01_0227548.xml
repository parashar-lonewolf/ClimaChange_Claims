        <p>LEAD: Urban smog reached record levels last year as medical evidence mounted that such pollution is a serious health threat, particularly to children, a Federal environmental official testified today.</p>
        <p>Urban smog reached record levels last year as medical evidence mounted that such pollution is a serious health threat, particularly to children, a Federal environmental official testified today.</p>
        <p>Without new efforts to control air pollution, smog will grow worse, the official told a Congressional subcommittee.</p>
        <p>The official, Don R. Clay, acting assistant administrator for air at the Environmental Protection Agency, said that average maximum levels of ozone, a chemically active gas that is a major component of smog, were 5 percent higher in 1988 than in 1983, when the previous record was set.  100 Areas Out of Compliance</p>
        <p>Testifying before the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Health and Environment Subcommittee, Mr. Clay said that 100 cities, counties and other areas failed to meet the agency's ozone standard in 1988, 28 more than in the previous year.</p>
        <p>About 150 million Americans now live in areas that exceeded the E.P.A.'s maximum safe level of ozone pollution on at least one occasion last year.</p>
        <p>Several medical doctors testified today that the recent research showedthe agency's maximum safe level, 0.12 parts per million in the air in any given hour, was inadequate to protect public health, particularly the health of children, who are more susceptible to respiratory problems from smog because of their smaller breathing passages and less developed immune systems.</p>
        <p>Dr. Philip J. Landrigan, speaking for the American Academy of Pediatrics and of the American Public Health Association, said that recent studies have shown that exposure to ozone at less than 0.08 parts per million could affect the function of children's lungs and that it would be ''prudent'' to limit children's outdoor play because they could suffer acute respiratory problems, including pain and shortness of breath. Chemical Reactions</p>
        <p>Ozone is a gas formed when three atoms of oxygen, rather than the normal two, bind together. At ground level most ozone is formed when pollutants, particularly hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides from a variety of sources, including motor vehicles and factories, react under the influence of sunlight and change chemically. Such reactions speed up when there are many hot, sunny days, such as there were last summer.</p>
        <p>Ozone in the upper atmosphere is formed naturally and is beneficial because it shields the earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun.</p>
        <p>Although the last of a series of deadlines for meeting the E.P.A. standard for ground-level ozone was passed in 1987, many cities around the country, including New York and particularly Los Angeles, are not close to reducing their ozone levels to the 0.12 parts per million level.</p>
        <p>Last July the E.P.A. issued preliminary findings based on a sample of its monitoring stations around the country indicating that ozone levels had reached the highest level of the 1980's. The figures reported by the agency today give the completed data through October.</p>
        <p>Several witnesses testified today that ozone pollution is likely to grow worse in the future as more automobiles are driven more miles and as the the number of hot days is increased because of the warming of the atmosphere by trapped gases.</p>
        <p>Dr. Thomas Godar, president of the American Lung Association, told the subcommittee that there was growing evidence that airborne sulfuric and nitric acid, created by the combustion of coal and oil, are an important component of smog and can cause serious health effects. He said that carbon monoxide from auto exhausts and other sources remained a threat to health, particularly to fetuses.</p>
        <p>For many years, smog was thought to be chiefly a problem for people suffering from asthma, emphysema and other respiratory disease. But Dr. Godar said a growing body of research showed that ''ozone can cause immediate short-term changes in lung function'' and increased symptoms of respiratory problems ''in healthy adults and children who exercise moderately or heavily during periods of elevated ozone concentrations.'' These symptoms can include coughing, pain and shortness of breath for people exposed to high ozone levels for as little as one hour, he reported.</p>
        <p>He said there was growing medical evidence that repeated exposure could cause permanent lung damage although such evidence was not conclusive. Controls Urged</p>
        <p>Dr. Godar called for strong action to reduce air pollution, including stricter controls on pollution from automobiles, new deadlines for cities to achieve the ozone reduction goal and an attack on the ozone problem on a regional rather than a local basis.</p>
        <p>Christopher C. Green, a medical doctor who directs biomedical research for the General Motors Corporation's Research Laboratories, said that the company's review of evidence indicated that no ''clinically significant health effects have been shown to result'' from exposure to ozone at levels reported by the E.P.A.</p>
        <p>He also said children had not been shown to suffer greater effects than normal adults. While General Motors is concerned with the protection of public health, he said, the consepollution has been ''the subject of considerable overstatement.''</p>
        <p>But Richard E. Ayres, chairman of the National Clean Air Coalition, an alliance of environmental, public health, consumer, labor, and church groups, told the subcommittee, ''We believe that the declining air quality of our cities can fairly be characterized as a public health crisis.''</p>
        <p>Today's hearing was the first by the subcommittee as it prepares to amend the Clean Air Act. Representative Henry A. Waxman, chairman of the subcommittee, said he was confident that legislation would be enacted this year including provisions to reduce acid rain and toxic air pollution as well as address the failure of cities to achieve safe levels of ozone and carbon monoxide pollution.</p>
        <p>Mr. Waxman, a California Democrat, said the new data from the Environmental Protection Agency ''demonstrates the fallacy of industry arguments that the nation's air pollution is getting better on its own. In fact, there is good reason to expect that the problem will continue to worsen in the absence of tough new control requirements.''</p>
