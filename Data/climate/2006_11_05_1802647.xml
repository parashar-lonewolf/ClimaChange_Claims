        <p>Climate negotiators are gathering in Nairobi, Kenya, for their 12th conference since 1992, with the world divided into three seemingly inflexible blocs on what to do about global warming.</p>
        <p>The conference will begin tomorrow and continue through Nov. 17. A host of specialists, including economists, environmentalists and United Nations officials, say the challenge this year is more daunting than ever.</p>
        <p>''Right now it seems that the glaciers in Greenland are moving faster than the negotiators,'' John Coequyt, an energy policy analyst for Greenpeace, said in an interview during his trip to the meeting.</p>
        <p>The discussions will focus on two international agreements that call for reductions in heat-trapping greenhouse gases, led by carbon dioxide, which is a byproduct of burning fossil fuels and forests.</p>
        <p>The first agreement, the Framework Convention on Climate Change, was adopted in 1992, but its voluntary goals were soon missed. An addendum to the treaty was adopted in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997 and took effect in February 2005. That pact, the Kyoto Protocol, requires most industrialized countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels by 2012.</p>
        <p>The United States and Australia, which accepted the 1992 treaty but not the Kyoto accord, will continue to promote voluntary programs to slow growth in emissions.</p>
        <p>Europe and Japan lead a group of industrial nations that have pledged to meet the limits. At the Nairobi conference, those nations will try to set a timetable for determining new emissions targets for the five years that begin in 2012.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, developing countries, focused on economic advancement, have rejected binding limits while demanding aid from industrial nations to limit damage from warming that is already inevitable.</p>
        <p>All the while, emissions have climbed.</p>
        <p>''Worrying'' was the word Yvo de Boer, the executive secretary of the United Nations organization administering the treaty, used to describe greenhouse gas emissions trends.</p>
        <p>The United Nations reported last Monday that emissions grew from 2000 to 2004 even in the European Union, which has led the diplomatic campaign for reductions. The figures are on the Web at ghg.unfccc.int.</p>
        <p>Some industries and lobbying groups opposed to mandatory limits point out that emissions in the United States grew just 1.3 percent during that period, far less than the 2.4 percent measured in Europe.</p>
        <p>But environmentalists said economic growth in the United States was slow in those years, and they noted that Europe's binding restrictions took effect only this year.</p>
        <p>Over all, the United States has maintained its position as by far the dominant source of such gases, although recent projections show China pulling ahead in a decade or two.</p>
        <p>Bjorn Lomborg, a Danish statistician who recently led the Copenhagen Consensus, an economic analysis of global environment and development issues , said that while global warming was a serious problem, Kyoto-style limits would have little impact and would divert resources better spent on alleviating poverty.</p>
        <p>He said one element missing from most climate discussions was the need for a more vigorous effort to improve climate-friendly energy technologies like solar power and carbon capture, in which greenhouse emissions are trapped and pumped underground before they can escape into the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>While many advocates have proposed an emissions tax, Dr. Lomborg said a much smaller investment in research and development on such technologies would be more likely to help in the long run.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Paula J. Dobriansky, the under secretary of state for democracy and global affairs, said the best chance of increasing energy supplies without climate damage lay in partnerships between industrialized countries and developing ones to spread the best technologies.</p>
        <p>''There are many types of zero-cost or low-cost ways of reducing emissions,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Environmental Rally in London</p>
        <p>LONDON, Nov. 4 (Reuters) -- More than 20,000 demonstrators rallied Saturday in London before environmental talks in Kenya, demanding that world leaders act to curb global warming.</p>
        <p>The event included a march from the American Embassy to protest President Bush's refusal to ratify the Kyoto Protocol emissions limits.</p>
