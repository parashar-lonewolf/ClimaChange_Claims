        <p>LEAD: A revolution began in this rural township because of the writings of the 18th-century pamphleteer Thomas Paine and the 15-year-old high school sophomore Tanja Vogt.</p>
        <p>A revolution began in this rural township because of the writings of the 18th-century pamphleteer Thomas Paine and the 15-year-old high school sophomore Tanja Vogt.</p>
        <p>Just as Paine, in his pamphlet ''Common Sense,'' sought redress from colonial inequities, so did Miss Vogt, in a current-events paper for a class studying Paine, seek an end to the use of polystyrene trays in the high school cafeteria because they are believed to damage the environment.</p>
        <p>Miss Vogt's thoughts prompted her 27-member class to take up the cause. Her classmates prompted the majority of the 1,400 high school students to act. They, in turn, caused the Board of Education to stop the use of polystyrene products in township schools. And now the students are reaching beyond this township in northern Passaic County to other schools in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Their actions are part of a growing national movement to ban polystyrene, a plastic foam material used for food containers that does not decompose, takes up shrinking landfill space and contains chlorofluorocarbons believed to deplete the ozone layer. In response to the concerns, the plastics industry is racing to develop technology to recycle the material. A United Nations Talk</p>
        <p>For West Milford, a triumphant chapter will be written on Monday, when Miss Vogt, a high school colleague and two students from Macopin Middle School here will go to an International Youth Environmental Forum at the United Nations and explain how their campaign began and, to their amazement, spread.</p>
        <p>It is a story that started with a zealous teacher who once thought of quitting his profession, and with a group of students who were initially insecure about their efforts.</p>
        <p>Miss Vogt, in her paper last October, wrote that the Board of Education was reluctant to stop using the foam trays because paper trays cost a nickel more. But she thought students would be willing to pay extra.</p>
        <p>Her social studies teacher, Karl Stehle, offered her idea as a class project.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stehle, 46 years old, who once was accepted for a Peace Corps assignment, had become a teacher instead because he thought he could ''make a difference.'' But three years ago, after 19 years teaching in the middle school, he wondered.</p>
        <p>''I was at a point in my life where I was thinking of going into business,'' he said. ''I needed a change, and they transferred me to the high school. It was the best thing that ever happened to me, and these kids have been an inspiration. And thanks to projects like this - really, this is what teaching is about. It's getting involved in things in society. There's a sense of hope with these youngsters.'' Initial Skepticism by Students</p>
        <p>When Mr. Stehle proposed Miss Vogt's idea to his class, students were initially apathetic. So he told them that Paine would have organized a lunch boycott.</p>
        <p>But suppose they were the only ones to show up with lunch bags during the boycott? People would laugh at them, some said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stehle told them that only a third of the people favored the American Revolution, but Paine's arguments for independence converted many.</p>
        <p>''You see the similarity?'' he asked. ''What we face here with the environment is what they faced in the revolution. It was a core that believed they could make a change.'' A Survey of Students</p>
        <p>So the class members surveyed other students, asking whether they would be willing to pay extra for paper trays. Eighty-six percent in the high school and 92 percent in the middle school said yes.</p>
        <p>Edward Vogel, the business administrator for the Board of Education, was impressed, Mr. Stehle said. But he said the students would have to back their words with actions: They would have a week in which they could buy lunch on foam trays for $1.20 or lunch on paper trays for $1.25.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stehle spoke at two assemblies, and a core group of 200 students coaxed others to pay the extra nickel. He said some students gave their colleagues nickels if they were short, and some received money from students they did not know.</p>
        <p>By week's end, 72 percent of the high school students and 86 percent of the middle school students had paid the extra nickel. In December, the board instituted an all-paper policy for township schools, in effect as of Feb. 1. The township council then suggested using paper trays in all township buildings.</p>
        <p>Norma Sullivan, a language arts and science teacher instrumental in the drive in the middle school, said a ''perceptive'' seventh-grader said one school district was not enough. Students began a letter-writing campaign to 700 schools in New Jersey. Of 77 schools that responded, most said they did not use plastic and, among the 29 that did, some said they would try to follow West Milford's lead. 'Like a Chain Reaction'</p>
        <p>The State Commissioner of Environmental Protection, Christopher J. Daggett, visited in March and congratulated more than 100 high school and middle school students for their involvement, promising to immediately stop using a stockpile of foam products in the department's cafeteria in Trenton.</p>
        <p>''I'm really surprised that it went this far,'' said Miss Vogt, who wants to be a teacher. ''Back in December, I thought we'd get the Board of Education to switch to paper in our school and that would be the end of it. And then, all of a sudden, it was like a chain reaction, and everyone started getting into it.''</p>
        <p>As for her talk to the United Nations forum, she said, ''I might say that if you believe in something, it can be successful, because just one person has to start, and it will keep going.''</p>
