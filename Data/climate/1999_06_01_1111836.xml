        <p>As the Northeast begins its smog season -- when sunshine, warmth and pollution combine to sting eyes and strain lungs -- state environmental officials from Maryland to Maine are reeling from a series of court rulings that have derailed Federal plans to cut the flow of air pollution across state borders.</p>
        <p>New York and other states in the region find themselves down to their last defense tactic against smog-causing chemicals drifting downwind from coal-fired power plants in the Middle West and the South, but even that tactic is likely to face court challenges.</p>
        <p>Last week, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency formally accepted petitions from New York, Pennsylvania and the six New England states requesting a federally imposed cleanup of dirty power plants in states that send nitrogen oxides and ozone -- the components of smog -- east on the wind. Petitions from New Jersey and Maryland are still under review.</p>
        <p>Under the Clean Air Act, after receiving such petitions, the E.P.A. can order sharp cuts in pollution at specific power plants or other sources. The petitions are a ''legal hammer'' of last resort against out-of-state polluters, said John P. Cahill, New York's Commissioner of Environmental Conservation. This is the first time the E.P.A. has accepted petitions of this sort, officials with the agency said.</p>
        <p>But the petitions are certain to be challenged in the courts by the same coalition of state governments and industry groups that gained the favorable court rulings against other aspects of the E.P.A.'s plans for reducing smog. Environmental officials from Middle Western states and power industry spokesmen say the E.P.A.'s strict new standards for smog are not supported by science.</p>
        <p>A result of legal challenges is likely to be further delays in ending smoggy summers in the Northeast, according to various state officials and private environmental groups.</p>
        <p>''The big polluters are succeeding in delaying rules that would prevent a lot of sickness and death in this region,'' said David R. Wooley, a law professor at Pace University who has been providing legal advice to a coalition of 18 private environmental organizations contributing briefs in the court fights.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, the 1999 smog season is off to an early start. New York State environmental officials on Saturday issued the first ozone advisory of the year, with levels in several parts of western New York rising above the Federal safety threshold of 80 parts per billion.</p>
        <p>The northeastern states have long contended, and the environmental agency concurs, that plumes of nitrogen oxides from old coal-fired power plants in the Middle West and South contribute to eye-burning haze and lung problems along the eastern seaboard. In the presence of sunlight, the nitrogen compounds produce ozone. Ozone, in turn, can irritate the lungs and eyes, contributing to asthma and raising death rates in the elderly and infirm. The nitrogen oxides also contribute to acid rain.</p>
        <p>To solve the problem, the E.P.A.  required 22 states last fall to file plans by September for sharply reducing emissions of nitrogen oxides.</p>
        <p>Separately, in 1997, the agency issued new limits for ozone that were far lower than the previous standard. That drew immediate legal challenges from power companies that relied on coal and states with older, dirtier power plants.</p>
        <p>The fight over long-distance air pollution has intensified in the last few years as the electric power industry has begun opening up to competition.</p>
        <p>States with many older, coal-fired power plants, like West Virginia and Michigan, have much cheaper electricity than areas with newer, cleaner power plants, like the Northeast, and they want to keep that competitive advantage, industry executives and state officials in both regions say.</p>
        <p>As a result, several state environmental officials said, after several years of relatively constructive negotiations and cooperative research among the states to reduce smog, talks have stalled and the battleground has shifted to the courts.</p>
        <p>The latest court rulings on Federal smog controls came on May 14 and May 25 in the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. In the first, two of three judges on a panel ruled that the E.P.A. had not adequately justified the need for a strict new standard for ozone. The same ruling overturned new standards for soot particles. The E.P.A. was invited to return to court to substantiate the numbers it chose.  That decision was hailed by industry groups and denounced by private environmental organizations and the Clinton Administration.</p>
        <p>In the second ruling, three judges, including the two that rejected the E.P.A.'s ozone standard, said that states could hold off on filing the plans for pollution cuts until the merits of the Federal requirements for nitrogen oxides were argued.</p>
        <p>Together, the rulings are likely to delay Federal programs to sharply cut levels of nitrogen oxides and ozone in the eastern half of the country, Carol M. Browner, the E.P.A. Administrator, said in a telephone interview on Thursday.</p>
        <p>The agency planned to return to court this summer with a new argument in support of its pollution standards, Ms. Browner said. ''We're going to continue to look at how to provide the relief to downwind states.''</p>
        <p>Russell J. Harding, the director of Michigan's Department of Environmental Quality, said Friday that the courts acted appropriately because the E.P.A. could identify no ''bright line'' for health effects of ozone that separated safe levels from hazardous ones.</p>
        <p>''Where there's no clear human threshold, then picking a number becomes a policy call,'' Mr. Harding said. He added that setting policy is the responsibility of Congress, not the agency.</p>
        <p>While waiting for appeals to play out, he said, Michigan plans to proceed with a nitrogen-cutting proposal and still intends to reduce its output of the smog-causing chemicals, but to a less stringent standard than that sought by the E.P.A. ''We know we have some culpability in Michigan,'' Mr. Harding said, ''but it's way, way less than what they're talking about.''</p>
        <p>''My view is that E.P.A. is in deep trouble, and they know it,'' he said. ''It's a house of cards that Carol Browner has built on politics and bad science, and it's falling.''</p>
        <p>Senior E.P.A. officials said the agency's smog standards had nothing to do with politics and were a result of hundreds of scientific studies and comments from states and industry.</p>
        <p>Robert C. Shinn, the New Jersey Commissioner of Environmental Protection, said there was plenty of evidence from studies in New Jersey backing the need for the strict ozone standard set by the E.P.A.</p>
        <p>He said New Jersey had commissioned a study of asthma attacks treated at a Morristown hospital and found that admissions rose 30 percent on days when ozone levels topped 60 parts per billion -- not even a level as high as the Federal standard of 80 parts per billion.</p>
        <p>He added that half of the ozone measured in the state has been shown to be a result of pollution carried on wind from the west. Mr. Shinn has an ozone meter in his state car, he said, and often keeps it running to track smog levels as he crisscrosses the state. ''I've found high levels in real rural areas -- in places where it just shouldn't be,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''If transport is 50 percent of our problem,'' Mr. Shinn said, ''no matter what we do to cut emissions here, we can never guarantee healthy air for our residents.''</p>
