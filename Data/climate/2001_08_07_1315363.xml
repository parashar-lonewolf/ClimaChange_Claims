        <p>The paraphernalia of the scientist are nowhere in sight in the huge, anonymous office in central Tokyo where Hideki Shirakawa, a Nobel laureate in chemistry in 2000, spends most of his time these days.</p>
        <p>In between the tedious evaluation of research proposals, his task as head of a new national commission to re-energize Japanese science involves reflecting long and hard on why his country's laboratories have produced so few stars on his level.</p>
        <p>''Fundamentally, Japanese culture is based on rice farming,'' said Dr. Shirakawa, 65, reaching for a time-honored explanation for a widely perceived aversion to individual initiative. ''Rice cultivation requires a lot of water, and water must be shared evenly by everyone. Planting rice also required teams of people walking from row to row, at the same speed. And all of this has meant that uniqueness had to be suppressed.''</p>
        <p>Officially, Dr. Shirakawa's brief involves nothing less than devising a strategy for Japan to win 30 more Nobel prizes in the sciences over the next 50 years. ''The figure is way too high,'' he says with a shrug and a wry smile. ''In the last 50 years we've only had six.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Shirakawa is diplomatic in raising the question of culture in evaluating why Japan, immensely rich with more than a century of universal education and the world's second largest economy, performs more like a modestly endowed middle-ranking country. Others in the scientific community are more scathing in their self-appraisal, and have begun calling for a revolution in the nation's laboratories and classrooms.</p>
        <p>The problems they cite include excessive government control over both research funding and education, faculties still steeped in Confucian ideals of age grade promotion and piety toward seniors, and a generalized penchant for seeking incremental advancement of knowledge at the expense of bold experimentation.</p>
        <p>But most important of all, disillusioned scientists say that Japan's research community has never managed to fully embrace peer review and criticism, whose sparks have always served to light creative fires in the West -- from Newton and Hooke to Einstein and Planck.</p>
        <p>''There is a lack of competition and critical evaluation in Japan,'' said Ikuo Kushiro, director of the Institute of Frontier Research of Earth Evolution, a former vice president of Tokyo University, whose role in this highly centralized country roughly approximates that of Harvard, Stanford and M.I.T. combined. ''Promotions don't depend on the size of one's contribution, but rather on their years of service, and scientists are very friendly, and tend to avoid debate.</p>
        <p>''I worked at the Carnegie Institution in Washington, and I knew two eminent scientists who were good friends, but once it came to their work, they would have severe debates, even in the journals. That kind of thing happens in the United States, but in Japan, never.''</p>
        <p>Although few outside Japan worry about the problem, the stakes are truly global. Just as Japan's economy, mired in recurrent recessions for 11 years, now constitutes a huge drag on the world's economy, the underperformance of the world's second richest country in scientific matters exacts a steep, but invisible cost in issues as diverse as fighting malaria and AIDS to understanding global warming.</p>
        <p>''Global science needs as many competent players as possible to address the thorny problems of health and the environment, and to make accurate statements on issues ranging from world climatic change to species endangerment and antibiotic-resistant organisms,'' wrote Samuel J. Coleman, author of ''Japanese Science: From the Inside,'' (Routledge, 1999) in a recent essay. ''As long as Japan is unable to translate its wealth and talent into substantial scientific contributions we are all the poorer for it.''</p>
        <p>On the surface, things might not appear so bleak for Japanese science. From the early 1990's, spending on research increased dramatically, as media reports here focused on the shoddy state of the country's university laboratories. Japan has sought to break out of the scientific ghetto of applied research, the long-favored emphasis on research with direct commercial applications.</p>
        <p>Japan now spends roughly half as much on scientific research as the United States ($118 billion compared with $229 billion in 1999, according to government statistics), more than twice as much as its closest rival in the West, Germany. As a result of those efforts, 9 percent of the articles published in scientific and technical journals worldwide in 1995 were by Japanese authors, according to the National Science Foundation, a United States Government agency.</p>
        <p>The spending increase may yield future leaps in knowledge, and garner Nobels, which are often awarded for work done several years earlier. In the last decade, however, Dr. Shirakawa was the only Japanese scientist to win a Nobel, for his work with other scientists to create a plastic that conducts electricity like a metal. Scientists in the United States won 44 Nobels in the last 10 years, Germany five, and France three.</p>
        <p>Nobel prizes are, of course, only one way to measure scientific output. But even a recent government paper here acknowledged that Japanese global influence on scientific research remains modest.</p>
        <p>''The Japanese government usually thinks it must increase funding to research,'' said Syukuro  Manabe, a renowned climate physicist who has spent most of his career working in the United States. ''But that alone will not enhance research productivity. Research funding must go to those who deserve funding rather than distributing it equally. They have to find some way to support the really distinguished researchers who deserve support, rather than those who do research for the sake of research. What we need to create is job insecurity rather than security to make people compete more.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Manabe recently returned to Japan after 40 years spent mostly in American government climate laboratories abroad to head the Frontier Research System for Global Change, a richly government-funded climate study institute. He created a stir last week, however, with a surprise announcement that he had decided to leave Japan once again for the United States.</p>
        <p>''In the funding system here decisions are made by a committee of distinguished scientists appointed by the ministry of education, but if we want to do better, we'll have to come up with true peer review system, like the one maintained by the National Science Foundation in the United States,'' Dr. Manabe said. ''Many of my fellow scientists agree with me, but then they say I am too Americanized, and complain that real peer review in Japan won't work.</p>
        <p>''The reason we have difficulty establishing a peer review system has to do with a kind of an Asian culture. You don't want to speak openly in criticism of someone else's work. It is kind of a mutual admiration society, and that has real consequences.''</p>
        <p>At Japan's ministry of education, culture, sports, science and technology, a gigantic bureaucracy that controls most of the grants for research here, officials say they have recognized that simply throwing huge sums of money at science will not increase scientific output.</p>
        <p>''We've introduced a term system for researchers in our national labs, and increased merit rewards for people with good ideas,'' said Nobuaki Kawakami, director of the ministry's division of planning and evaluation. ''We've been trying to increase competitiveness and career mobility in science because we recognize this as one of the most important problems we have to tackle.''</p>
        <p>Repeating a grievance that was echoed by many scientists themselves, he said, ''Our researchers tend to choose easy projects, which is to say, building on things that are already known, so that they can expect results quickly.''</p>
        <p>Many scientists applaud those kinds of changes, but insist that much more will need to be done in order to lift Japan to the ranks of a real power in science.</p>
        <p>''Things are changing and that is very encouraging,'' said Okamoto Hitoshi, an expert in vertebrate development who at 43 is a relatively young laboratory chief. ''But the slots available to young people, although no longer zero, are still very few compared to the United States.</p>
        <p>''Our level is not so low that you can get a promotion without doing good science these days. But it is true that the criticism between us is not so great. Teachers still tell you that eloquence may be silver, but silence is golden.''</p>
