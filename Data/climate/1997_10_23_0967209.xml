        <p>The most important thing to understand about President Clinton's speech on global warming yesterday is that he has asked the United States, a hungry producer and consumer of energy, to reverse course. He has publicly committed the country to a plan to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, the gas mainly responsible for what could be a calamitous increase in atmospheric temperatures. He has agreed to binding targets and a timetable -- the stabilization of greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. He has proposed a system for doing so, relying largely on market mechanisms, energy efficiency and technology.</p>
        <p>His package is less than what many environmentalists had hoped for and not nearly as aggressive as the goals that some foreign countries will put on the table when the industrialized nations convene in Kyoto, Japan, in December to try to negotiate a global climate treaty. The Europeans, for example, are seeking net reductions from 1990 levels by a much earlier date, 2005. But the plan also asks American industry to make greater investments in cleaner fuels and new technologies than they have been asked to make in the past. The threat is clear. If industry does not make these investments, Mr. Clinton's successors may have to resort to far more expensive remedies to achieve the targets he has set.</p>

        <p>The most important thing to understand about President Clinton's speech on global warming yesterday is that he has asked the United States, a hungry producer and consumer of energy, to reverse course. He has publicly committed the country to a plan to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, the gas mainly responsible for what could be a calamitous increase in atmospheric temperatures. He has agreed to binding targets and a timetable -- the stabilization of greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. He has proposed a system for doing so, relying largely on market mechanisms, energy efficiency and technology.</p>
        <p>His package is less than what many environmentalists had hoped for and not nearly as aggressive as the goals that some foreign countries will put on the table when the industrialized nations convene in Kyoto, Japan, in December to try to negotiate a global climate treaty. The Europeans, for example, are seeking net reductions from 1990 levels by a much earlier date, 2005. But the plan also asks American industry to make greater investments in cleaner fuels and new technologies than they have been asked to make in the past. The threat is clear. If industry does not make these investments, Mr. Clinton's successors may have to resort to far more expensive remedies to achieve the targets he has set.</p>
        <p>Indeed, there are many who argue that even Mr. Clinton's relatively modest goals cannot be met without carbon taxes that would encourage switches to cleaner fuels, or stiff new gasoline taxes that would encourage energy conservation. Mr. Clinton has rejected that course, in part because he knows it would be difficult to sell to the present Congress and in part because he believes that innovation, incentives and the free market can get the job done without serious economic turmoil.</p>
        <p>To that end, he proposes to give industries that achieve early reductions in emissions ''credits'' against the day when firm industry-by-industry emissions caps take effect. By giving extra credit to companies that lower emissions quickly, Mr. Clinton hopes to spur innovation and efficiencies and put the United States on a downward slope as early in the next century as possible. That is exactly the slope the country must be on if it is to scale back its emissions to 1990 levels.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has also embraced another innovative idea that could help solve one of the most vexing problems facing the negotiators in Kyoto -- how to bring developing countries like China and India into a global system. The developing countries will not be legally bound by whatever plan is hatched in Kyoto. Mr. Clinton's idea is to entice them into the system with an international emissions trading program under which rich nations can win further credits against their targets by helping poorer nations develop advanced, and presumably cleaner, methods of producing energy.</p>
        <p>The environmentalists and the Europeans will surely press Mr. Clinton for a more accelerated timetable before his negotiators arrive in Kyoto. But that cannot obscure the fact that for the first time, a President has committed this country to changing the ways it produces and uses energy.</p>
