        <p>LEAD: A teen-age girl who was the first recipient of an implanted device that works like a lung died early today, four and a half days after the operation.</p>
        <p>A teen-age girl who was the first recipient of an implanted device that works like a lung died early today, four and a half days after the operation.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for LDS Hospital here said the girl, Melicia Harvey, a 16-year-old student from Arthur City, Tex., died of pulmonary failure at 5:30 A.M. The experimental intravascular oxygenator, a bundle of hollow synthetic fibers that deliver oxygen to the blood, functioned as intended until the girl's death, said the spokesman, Tim Madden.</p>
        <p>The girl had been in critical condition throughout the experiment, with severe respiratory distress syndrome, which has a variety of causes and is characterized by the lungs' inability to transfer oxygen to the blood.</p>
        <p>Miss Harvey, whose father, Atrell Harvey 2d, is employed by the Campbell Soup Company, was a member of the student council at North Lamar High School in Paris, Tex., The Paris News reported. The girl's mother, Edith, died Jan. 31; the cause of her death was not disclosed.</p>
        <p>Device Implanted on Friday</p>
        <p>The device, which has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use for up to seven days to allow damaged lungs to rest and recover, was implanted in a vein in two hours of surgery on Friday. The device has received F.D.A. approval for up to 10 experimental implants in patients who have no better than a 10 percent chance of survival.</p>
        <p>The bundle of fibers, an inch wide and 20 inches long, is connected to two external tubes the size of a soda straw. One tube delivers oxygen from a hospital system or oxygen tank, and the other removes carbon dioxide from the body, a waste product of breathing.</p>
        <p>The alternative for people with acute lung failure is an extracorporeal oxygenator, a machine that requires pumping the blood outside the body.</p>
        <p>''There were no clinical complications from the use of the device,'' Mr. Madden said in a statement. It was unclear how long doctors had planned to leave the device inside the girl.</p>
        <p>A 'Lung-Assist' Device</p>
        <p>Doctors have emphasized that the device is not an artificial lung but a ''lung-assist'' device capable of satisfying half the body's need for oxygen and for carbon-dioxide removal. But they said it could lead to the development of an artificial lung someday.</p>
        <p>The inventor, Dr. J. D. Mortensen of CardioPulmonics Inc. in Salt Lake City, said initial experiments would involve only patients with acute lung disease, like pneumonia or smoke inhalation, not chronic disorders like cystic fibrosis or emphysema.</p>
        <p>LDS Hospital is one of four medical centers authorized by the F.D.A. for testing the device. The others are Hershey Medical Center at Pennsylvania State University, the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor and the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center.</p>
