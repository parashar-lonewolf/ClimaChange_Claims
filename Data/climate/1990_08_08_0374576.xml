        <p>LEAD: Natural gas, long regarded by oil producers as the crab grass of fossil fuels, is getting new consideration because of the crisis in the Middle East.</p>
        <p>Natural gas, long regarded by oil producers as the crab grass of fossil fuels, is getting new consideration because of the crisis in the Middle East.</p>
        <p>Finding gas has always been a disappointment to drillers looking for oil; bringing natural gas to market requires expensive pipelines or other equipment, while oil can be loaded on tankers and sold anywhere on earth. As a result, huge volumes of gas have been found but left in the ground, especially in the third world.</p>
        <p>''This is really a new business,'' said Robinson West, president of the Petroleum Finance Company, a consulting firm in Washington. ''There is an enormous amount of gas, and gas reserves are located in different areas than oil reserves. Many importing countries have substantial gas reserves.''</p>
        <p>Global oil reserves amount to about one trillion barrels, and gas reserves to the equivalent of about 665 billion. But the world uses five times as much oil as gas. That could change markedly if world governments believe that Saddam Hussein has created a long-term increase in the price of oil.</p>
        <p>At C. J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc., a brokerage firm, Charles T. Maxwell, the vice chairman and energy strategist, pointed out that oil now meets about 37 percent of the world's energy needs, and 15 percent is from OPEC members. ''Now one guy is coming along, saying, 'I'm going to raise the price on that 15 percent.' '' he said. ''The other 85 percent isn't going to stand for it.'' Natural gas and coal producers will try to seize some of the oil market, he said.</p>
        <p>The experience of the 1970's and 1980's was that a stiff increase in oil prices led to fuel-shifting and efficiency improvements that cut oil demand so sharply that a price war broke out among producers. This leads Mr. Maxwell and other analysts to doubt whether the current high oil prices can be sustained.</p>
        <p>Another important feature of natural gas is that its reserves are dispersed compared with oil's. While OPEC members lay claim to about two-thirds of the world's oil reserves, they hold only about one-third of its gas.</p>
        <p>But some oil-exporting countries, including OPEC members, are using more natural gas themselves, as are many oil-importing nations. But unlike importers, who want less dependence on oil, the exporters want gas to displace oil in their own economies and increase the volume of more valuable oil that they can export, say Mr. West and others.</p>
        <p>Still, some natural gas exports come from OPEC members. Thomas R. Robinson, associate director for natural gas at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass., pointed out that Japan, the destination for most of the gas that is liquefied for transport, imports from Indonesia, which is an OPEC member. ''But it's not an OPEC question per se,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Shell, Elf Aquitaine and Agit are considering a liquefied natural gas export project in Nigeria, and Exxon and Shell are considering a similar project in Venezuela, Mr. West said. Both countries are OPEC members and both are looking for more revenue.</p>
        <p>Indigenous Use</p>
        <p>A major market for natural gas may be indigenous use in the third world. The World Bank has been trying for several years to encourage third-world oil importers to use their gas reserves.</p>
        <p>Petter Nore, a gas specialist at the bank's Natural Gas Development Unit, said that gas is usually priced in contracts that tie it to both oil and coal, so that even in a sharp run-up in oil prices, as is now occurring, the gas price is mitigated by that of the other fuel, increasing its price advantage over oil.</p>
        <p>In addition, he said natural gas is perceived to have a greater security of supply than oil products. Part of this grows from the inflexibility of the supply: if it arrives by pipeline, it cannot be easily diverted. 75% Cost Reduction A study by the World Bank found eight oil-importing countries in which natural gas could be delivered to population centers for less than $1 per thousand cubic feet, less than a quarter of the cost for the same quantity of energy in the form of oil when oil is $28 a barrel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nore added, however, that the current crisis would have to persist to have an effect on many governments. ''You don't see a response in the gas situation just because Hussein does something for two months,'' he said. ''This would have to be something that you perceive to be a permanent shift.''</p>
        <p>In the United States, natural gas has been priced in recent months at about 85 percent of the cost of oil, said Dr. Marion B. Stewart, an economist with National Economic Research Associates in White Plains. With the recent surge in oil prices, he said, ''my sense is that we have enough of a supply response on the part of gas producers that we will not see gas move up in lockstep; it will move up a good deal less.'' 500,000 Barrels a Day Consumption was declining this year because of weak economic activity, he said, and the oil price increase will add to gas's use. He expects that gas may be substituted for the use of about 500,000 barrels of oil a day. United States oil demand has lately been around 17 million barrels a day.</p>
        <p>Some experts say the market for transportation fuel, where about 60 percent of United States oil use takes place, is particularly appropriate for natural gas. Theodore Eck, an economist at the Amoco Corporation, a large gas producer as well as an oil producer, said the consumption of 500,000 barrels of oil a day could be shifted to gas in a few years by conversion of fleet vehicles and trucks to natural gas.</p>
