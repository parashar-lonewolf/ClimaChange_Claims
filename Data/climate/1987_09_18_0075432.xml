        <p>LEAD: There is little evidence that acid rain poses an immediate broad threat to the environment or public health, a Reagan Administration study group has concluded.</p>
        <p>There is little evidence that acid rain poses an immediate broad threat to the environment or public health, a Reagan Administration study group has concluded.</p>
        <p>The interagency National Acid Precipitation Program, which is conducting a long-term assessment of acid rain that was ordered by Congress, said studies so far showed that damage to lakes from acid rain was limited to a few areas, mostly in the Northeast, and that even in those areas only a small percentage of the lakes were affected.</p>
        <p>The assessment was contained in a long-awaited interim report made public today; the final report is due in 1990. Report Termed Misleading</p>
        <p>The report said that, in these affected areas, ''a significant increase in the number of acidic lakes is unlikely to occur over the next few decades'' at the current level of pollution. The executive summary of the report also found little damage to forests, no damage to crops and ''no demonstrated effects'' on human health from acid rain.</p>
        <p>But environmentalists, a number of members of Congress and some scientists criticized the report, calling it a misleading political document that serves the Administration's policy goal of avoiding any mandatory controls that require industry to reduce the pollution that leads to acid rain.</p>
        <p>The report was also assailed by Canada's environment minister, Tom McMillan, who said that ''it was bad science and bad policy'' because it ''downplays the urgency of the problem.'' Canada contends that acid rain from the United States is damaging its lakes and forests, and wants Washington to act to reduce the damage.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, in a concession to Canadian demands that he take the acid rain problem more seriously, President Reagan said he had agreed to consider a proposal that the two nations negotiate a bilateral accord on controlling acid rain. But he has run into resistance in Congress over getting money for more research.</p>
        <p>Dr. J. Laurence Kulp, executive director of the assessment program, said the report was a ''state-of-the-science document'' and ''not a policy document at all.'' At a news conference today Dr. Kulp, a former science professor at Columbia University who later worked as a scientist for the Weyerhaeuser Company, said he would have resigned as director of the program if he had been subjected to any political pressure.</p>
        <p>Acid rain is a form of air pollution, largely oxides of sulfur and nitrogen that are transported through the atmosphere where they change chemically and fall to earth as acidic rain, snow, fog or dry particles. Because acid rain has been found to destroy freshwater life and is suspected of damaging forests, crops and human health, Congress is considering legislation to control the emissions of the pollutants that cause acid rain, most of which come from factories or power plants that use coal.</p>
        <p>The Administration strongly opposes such controls, saying they would impose costs on utilities and consumers on the basis of insufficient scientific evidence to show that acid rain caused significant damage to the environment or to human health. Acidified Lakes Studied</p>
        <p>Among the conclusions of the 100-page summary was that even in those areas of the country that are most sensitive to acid rain, the acidification of lakes has been negligible. In the areas that have been most affected, notably in New York State's Adirondack Mountains, 2 percent of the lake region and 10 percent of the lakes had become acidified.</p>
        <p>The report counted as acidified those lakes with a pH factor of 5 or below. The lower the pH - a measure of hydrogen ion concentration - the more acidic the water. Pure water has a pH of 7. The acidity of coffee is 5; that of lemon juice is 2.</p>
        <p>The report said evidence so far showed there was probably no damage to forests from acid rain, although possibly some damage to forest soil.</p>
        <p>Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, an atmospheric physicist for the Environmental Defense Fund, said the conclusion that acid rain contributed little to forest damage was a ''startling misrepresentation.''</p>
        <p>The summary offered what Dr. Kulp called a ''base case'' projection of emissions by coal-fired power plants that showed emissions of sulfur dioxide declining substantially by the year 2030 without any controls program.</p>
        <p>The projection was based on an assumption that older coal-fired power plants would be retired after 50 years of service and those that continued in service would have new equipment that could reduce sulfur emissions by 90 percent or more.</p>
        <p>Richard Ayres, a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a national environmental group, said the projection that sulfur dioxide emissions would go down was based on ''implausible assumptions,'' and added: ''This report is designed to make people believe the Reagan Administration line that acid rain is not a serious problem. The whole report is political propaganda, not science.''</p>
        <p>But Lee M. Thomas, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said: ''There isn't any merit or substance to the charge that this is a political document. It is a good scientific assessment of what we know about acid rain.''</p>
