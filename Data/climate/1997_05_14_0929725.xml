        <p>MARY EVANS trudged across the grounds of Longwood Gardens on a visit the other day. ''Now it's official,'' she said in the stately botanical park on the former estate of the chemical tycoon Pierre S. du Pont, in Kennett Square, 30 miles west of Philadelphia. ''The rhubarb's up. It's spring.''</p>
        <p>In gardens across the northern half of the country, similar epiphanies are taking place. The rhubarb -- the first sign since the fall pumpkins wilted that the vegetable garden lives -- is rising.</p>
        <p>''The rhubarb is just peeking through right now,'' said Dr. Otho Wells, a professor of plant biology at the University of New Hampshire. ''That means spring.''</p>
        <p>Early rhubarb, which begins arriving in New York City's Greenmarkets this weekend, is not impressive. It looks and grows like a weed. Even at its peak, it tastes to the uninitiated like something that probably should not be swallowed. Yet gardeners exult at the first sight of it.</p>
        <p>''I grew up in North Carolina on a strawberry farm, and we always looked forward to that first chomp of rhubarb,'' Dr. Wells said. ''It was a ritual. Now that the supermarkets have all produce all the time, it's easy to forget the growing cycle of the garden. Rhubarb is a reminder.''</p>
        <p>Once established, rhubarb grows almost as prolifically as zucchini, though it is not nearly so easy to unload on friends and neighbors at the end of the season, which for rhubarb comes around July 4.</p>
        <p>Experts joke that growing rhubarb is easier than cooking it, which requires attention to detail and a willing suspension of certain basic culinary instincts, like the disinclination to think of a bushy, sour-tasting plant as dessert. Yet rhubarb is commonly called ''pie plant,'' and dozens of books have been written about the joys of rhubarb pie alone.</p>
        <p>Rhubarb can be poached, baked, sauteed, and stewed into a compote. It makes tangy sauces, muffins, marinades, jams, chutneys and wine. Not to mention laxatives, an early medicinal use.</p>
        <p>With wide, heart-shape leaves waving like flags over three-foot stalks, rhubarb can ornament a garden. Some gardeners use its supple leaves as baskets for carrying fragile produce like strawberries.</p>
        <p>Rhubarb veterans always warn novices about the leaves. They may look like a fabulous new lettuce, but don't expect these leaves to be showing up beside arugula in a salad. The leaves contain most of the plant's oxalic acid, which is a poison.</p>
        <p>''If you consume enough leaves, you probably could kill yourself, although it would be an odd way to do it,'' Dr. Wells said.</p>
        <p>The stems, meanwhile, the only edible part, are high in minerals. But except as fiber, they are not particularly nutritious.</p>
        <p>''One cup of rhubarb cooked with sugar has 348 milligrams of calcium, more calcium than in a cup of milk,'' said Dr. Wendy M. Stevens, a professor of biology and a nutrition specialist at Luther College in Decorah, Iowa. ''Unfortunately, rhubarb stems also have some oxalic acid, which ties up calcium. So you really don't absorb any minerals to speak of. Even though it looks like it's a good source of calcium, it's actually a very poor one.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, researchers find new uses for the hardy perennial.</p>
        <p>Last year, Yale University scientists discovered that sodium oxalate from rhubarb and related plants can chemically break down the chlorofluorocarbons eroding the earth's ozone layer. But sodium oxalate has to be heated to 520 degrees to zap the ozone pollution.</p>
        <p>Rhubarb lovers were given something to chew on with a 1992 breakthrough in DNA research at the University of North Carolina. Scientists discovered that rhubarb -- which thrives when fertilized by cow, horse and even chicken manure -- may be among the species capable of genetic engineering into ''flesh-eating plants,'' like the Venus' flytrap.</p>
        <p>That thought gave some pause to Dr. Wells. ''My rhubarb is only now getting to the point where I can start chomping on it,'' he said. ''I don't even ever want to think of it chomping back.''</p>
