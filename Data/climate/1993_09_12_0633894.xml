        <p>FOR more than 200 years, Kentucky bourbon has been the unofficial Bluegrass State spirit. Bourbon folklore credits the Rev. Elijah Craig, an 18th-century Kentucky Baptist preacher, with discovering the formula for this distinctly American beverage: mixing corn with smaller amounts of rye or other grains, cooking the mixture in limestone spring water, then aging it in charred, white-oak barrels.</p>
        <p>During the 19th century, bourbon distilling became a popular Kentucky cottage industry, with hundreds of tiny distilleries sprinkled throughout the state.</p>
        <p>Later, the combination of Prohibition, limitations put on production during World War II and corporate buyouts dramatically reduced the number of the state's bourbon distilleries; in 1911 there were 189, today there are 9.</p>
        <p>On a recent trip to Kentucky, I visited four of the five distilleries that are open to the public, sampled bourbon cuisine and discovered a variety of bourbon-laced condiments. Although the distillery tours are equal parts information and bourbon boosterism, they are great fun, challenge the senses and add colorful terms to your vocabulary like "white dog."</p>
        <p>Boulevard Distillers' Wild Turkey plant, three miles east of Lawrenceburg, offers the most complete tour. The entire distillery, including its 12 seven-story warehouses, sits behind typical bluegrass-horse-farm fences amid rolling farmland on a bluff overlooking the Kentucky River. Birds twitter in nearby trees and a slight beer-like odor wafts over the grounds.</p>
        <p>Our tour leader begins by rattling off facts and figures as we walk into the plant and toward a 14-foot wood turkey staring down from the boiler-house roof.</p>
        <p>We learn that by Federal law, bourbon must: contain at least 51 percent corn grain, come off as evaporation from the still at less than 160 proof (80 percent alcohol), be put into charred, white-oak barrels, which can only be used once, get all of its color and flavoring from the inside of the barrel and age at least two years.</p>
        <p>One of our first stops is the fermenting room, where the mixture of corn, rye and barley malt, after being cooked and cooled, is pumped into cypress or stainless-steel vats that are 18 feet in diameter and 17 feet tall. A backset, which is similar to sourdough starter, is added, as is yeast, which converts the sugar in the mixture to alcohol and releases carbon dioxide. The result is a bubbling, popping, fermenting mass that smells like beer and looks like oatmeal with hiccups. We are encouraged to touch this lively brew, which feels rather gritty.</p>
        <p>Although the rest of the tour does not follow the same order that the manufacturing process itself does, it allows one to peek into almost every nook and cranny of bourbon production. We walk past the shiny three-story solid copper still that vaporizes the alcohol before it is condensed into what Boulevard Distillers calls white dog. We watch women fill barrels with a version of this clear liquid diluted with water, then hammer in the bungs -- poplar corks, two inches in diameter.</p>
        <p>The warehouses are dark and cool, with row upon row of barrels stacked three-high on wood struts called ricks. The 1896 warehouse we visit has a delicate bourbon aroma. At the dump room, our guide drains a barrel that discharges chunks of black char along with the potent amber liquid. We all inhale deeply.</p>
        <p>Our tour continues past the busy bottling lines where rows of workers fill, cap and box bourbon bottles, through the warehouses stacked with cartons and into the quality-control laboratory.</p>
        <p>Back at the visitor's center, we are offered delicious homemade chocolate bourbon truffles, since distilleries are not allowed to provide liquid samples. Since I want the liquid variety also, my tour guide suggests a visit to Shryock's Bourbon Shoppe, a Lawrenceburg liquor store. I am astounded to find that Shryock's sells almost 60 different bourbons, ranging in price from $5.95 to $51.85 a fifth.</p>
        <p>From Lawrenceburg, the Blue Grass Parkway runs southwest to Bardstown, the self-proclaimed bourbon capital of the world, which was once home to 22 distilleries. There, bourbon fans should begin their tour as I did, at the Oscar Getz Museum of Whisky History, which includes a collection of more than 200 whisky bottles, including one shaped like a pretzel, another shaped like a hot tamale and even one shaped like a tree slab. There are also medicinal bourbon bottles dating from Prohibition, when six Kentucky distilleries were allowed to produce bourbon that could be sold only to people with a doctor's prescription.</p>
        <p>Three of the Bardstown area's four bourbon distilleries welcome visitors. The most picturesque is Maker's Mark, 19 miles south of Bardstown.</p>
        <p>Originally an 1805 gristmill, now a National Historic Landmark, the distillery resembles a prosperous, tidy horse farm more than a small industry. Cardinals flit near a tranquil creek that meanders through well-manicured grounds, past dark brown buildings with bright red shutters.</p>
        <p>Tours start at the prim red and gray Visitor's Center, built in 1889 to house the resident master distiller. Today, the center is filled with product souvenirs, including "That Special Touch" ($29.95), a fat bourbon cookbook with recipes from Bourbon Steak Pasta to Banana Bourbon Cake.</p>
        <p>Although the tour is not as comprehensive as Boulevard Distillers', it provides an excellent overview of the distilling process.</p>
        <p>My favorite stop was at the vast fermenting vats, where we dipped our fingers in to taste the seething broth. A vat just filled with mash tasted sweet, while one three days old was quite sour. Another highlight was the Quart House, a tiny single-room structure that the tour leader said was believed to be America's oldest standing liquor store. Local farmers used to bring their quart jugs here to be filled directly from bourbon barrels.</p>
        <p>Although there are no tours at the Jim Beam Distillery, 15 miles northwest of Bardstown, a visitors' center exhibits 500 Beam Regal China Decanters, shows a 10-minute film explaining the distilling process and sells a vast number of Jim Beam trinkets. Behind the center, visitors can peer inside a warehouse, see a battered copper still that the company says is America's oldest, and view a reconstructed 19th-century cooperage once used to make the charred-oak barrels essential to bourbon production.</p>
        <p>Beam's decanter display is a pop-culture affirmation that bottles can come in any shape, from Army boots to wildlife. My favorite was a Mount St. Helens volcano bottle with a stopper shaped like an ash explosion. If you don't have time for a full tour at another distillery, Beam's is worth a visit.</p>
        <p>Several Bardstown restaurants feature bourbon-fortified menus, including Dagwood's, where I sampled steak marinated in 12-year-old Elijah Craig bourbon ($15.95). Although there was a definite bourbon undertone, the preparation was otherwise unremarkable. In contrast, Kurtz Restaurant's traditional biscuit pudding with bourbon sauce ($2.25) was sweetly successful. Day-old biscuits are baked with cinnamon and bourbon-soaked raisins, then doused with a light, bourbon-spiked sauce. After dinner, I visited Old Talbott Tavern, a historic 1779 stone structure that pours 10 different bourbons. Here I sampled Maker's Mark ($16.95 a fifth), a very smooth, subtly sweet bourbon with a warm, mellow aftertaste.</p>
        <p>Beyond Bardstown, bourbon byways lead to Frankfort, where visitors can tour the Leestown Company (Ancient Age) Distillery and Rebecca Ruth Candies, known for its decadent bourbon balls.</p>
        <p>The Ancient Age Distillery tour began in a two-story, 1932 log cabin, where we saw an introductory film, viewed product exhibits and passed by the "sniffing barrel" -- a barrel of Ancient Age with a flap on top. Visitors are encouraged to lean over and take a heady whiff.</p>
        <p>Although the company's safety concerns limit the tour, we were able to go inside a variety of buildings, including some steeped in molasses aromas and others fragrant with bourbon. After the tour, the guide passed out free bungs and I bought a jar of Ancient Age Four Fruit Preserves ($3.25), pear, peach, plum and strawberry jam with a subtle bourbon kick.</p>
        <p>Continuing my search for the quintessential bourbon food product, I took the 10-minute Rebecca Ruth Candies tour, going past aromatic cream candy production lines and cauldrons of melted chocolate.</p>
        <p>Founded in 1919, Rebecca Ruth is known for its delectable bourbon balls: white cream centers saturated with bourbon, surrounded by chocolate and topped by a pecan (13 ounces for $10.35).</p>
        <p>Later at Kentucky Boutique, the gift shop at Louisville's airport, I found two other delicious bourbon products: Old Mill Bourbon Jelly ($1.99), which has a pure, sweet bourbon flavor, and Kentucky Bourbon Sauce ($5.99), a rich, custard-like concoction delicious over ice cream.</p>
        <p>Back home, my Louisville-reared husband, Don, and I sampled a range of bourbons from each distillery I had visited. Using 50 milliliter bottles that I purchased either in Kentucky or at home, we followed directions in a free Maker's Mark pamphlet that describes how to judge a bourbon's color, bouquet, flavor and finish. Our favorites were designer bourbons, including small-batch (limited production) and single-barrel bourbons introduced to compete with Cognac and single-malt scotch.</p>
        <p>We found Ancient Age's Blanton ($38.95 for a fifth) sweet with a hint of vanilla, and Wild Turkey's Rare Breed ($29.95) even more complex, with an energetic finish. Jim Beam's designer line includes Booker's ($45.95), a nutty, aromatic bourbon; more subtle Baker's ($36.50); sweet, fruity Knob Creek ($23.50), and the extremely smooth, delicately flavored Basil Hayden ($31.50).
