        <p>The way Andrew H. Card Jr. tells it, the first time he ever set eyes on George W. Bush in Kennebunkport, Me., in 1979, the younger Bush cut a most unimpressive profile.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush was a defeated politician who had failed in his bid the year before to become a United States congressman from Texas. And Mr. Card, a Republican state legislator from Massachusetts helping the elder George Bush seek the Republican nomination for president, was taken aback by the difference between what he saw as the patrician father and plebeian son.</p>
        <p>''I expected to see a Yalie, and what I saw was West Texas,'' Mr. Card said in a telephone interview of that first encounter with the younger George. ''He was wearing cowboy boots and dirty jeans and was chewing tobacco and it was drooling out of his mouth.''</p>
        <p>But then, Mr. Card spun positive, adding, ''He was sincere, warm and inviting. I liked him right off the bat because he was a regular, real person.''</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Card, 53, is the younger Mr. Bush's chief of staff in waiting, poised to move into a crucial office in the West Wing should Mr. Bush be validated as president. People who have worked with Mr. Card over the years say he would bring to the job total loyalty to the Bushes, a voracious appetite for hard work, a willingness to obey orders and a manageable ego.</p>
        <p>''He's not a sparkling personality,'' said Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser in the Bush administration. ''He's a very quiet, down-to-earth person. He's a workhorse not a show dog, absolutely.''</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Bush campaigned as a Washington outsider independent of his father's strings, Mr. Card is very much a Washington insider, a corporate lobbyist for the automobile industry and General Motors who served in both the Reagan and Bush administrations and enjoys the ultimate trust not only of Mr. Bush but also of his father and mother.</p>
        <p>''I would do anything to help his parents,'' Mr. Card said in the interview. ''They were wonderful to me. I have an infinite amount of love for them. They took an interest in my wife, the challenges I went through bringing up my kids. But my respect for Governor Bush is independent of my love for his parents.''</p>
        <p>Born in Holbrook, Mass., on May 10, 1947, Mr. Card graduated from the University of South Carolina with a degree in engineering. His wife of 33 years, the former Kathleene Bryan, whom he met in the fifth grade, was ordained as a Methodist minister two years ago. They have three grown children and four grandchildren.</p>
        <p>Mr. Card's interest in politics began when he became president of the class of 1965 at Holbrook High School. After four terms in the State Legislature, he ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1982. Then Vice President George Bush helped land him an unglamorous but respectable job in the Reagan White House in 1983 as liaison with elected state officials, former Reagan and Bush administration officials said. He stayed for the rest of the administration.</p>
        <p>''Vice President Bush rarely got involved in personnel matters, but he really went to bat for Andy Card,'' recalled Chase Untermeyer, personnel director in the Bush White House.</p>
        <p>After serving as the elder Mr. Bush's campaign manager for the crucial New Hampshire primary in 1988, Mr. Card was rewarded with the job of deputy chief of staff in the Bush administration, and then served as secretary of transportation in its final year.</p>
        <p>When a hurricane struck Florida that year, Mr. Card was made President Bush's personal emissary for disaster relief and dispatched there  to dispel the widely held belief that the administration had done too little too late. He was one of the last people to leave the Bush administration, staying on until two months into the Clinton administration in what was referred to as the ''out-transition office'' to make sure all the Bush paperwork had been completed.</p>
        <p>In ''Barbara Bush: A Memoir,'' the former first lady Barbara Bush  referred to Mr. Card as a man who repeatedly ''had come to our rescue.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Card stayed on in Washington, turning himself into the top lobbyist in Washington for the automotive industry. In 1993 he became president and chief executive of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, where he oversaw the lobbying against tighter fuel-economy and air pollution regulations for automobiles and in coming up with technical arguments for why industrializing nations should proceed slowly in addressing global warming. When that organization was dissolved in 1998, he became General Motors' vice president for government relations in Washington.</p>
        <p>Mr. Card prides himself on his humility. When he was offered the job of running the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia in July, he demurred.</p>
        <p>''I told them they had the right to change their mind and asked them to stop and reflect on it'' in case there were better choices, he told an interviewer from The Patriot Ledger newspaper in Quincy, Mass. He said he did not accept the assignment until he consulted with two other lieutenants from the Bush presidency, former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and former Secretary of State James A. Baker III.</p>
        <p>As for being offered the job of chief of staff in waiting, he said in the telephone interview, ''I'm thrilled, honored, appropriate in my humility, because I have to stretch to do the job. But I'd rather stretch than bend over to do it.''</p>
