        <p>A scientific panel, in a study requested by the Interior Department, concluded that an ambitious federal plan to restore natural water flows to the Everglades needed to be more carefully integrated with monitoring of the ailing ecosystem. Otherwise, it will be impossible to determine if the billions of dollars that will be spent to store excess summer rainwater and supply it to the Everglades in dry times is having a beneficial effect. The plan also needs to account more carefully for rising sea levels and other changes brought on by global warming, said the panel, which was convened by the National Academies.</p>
