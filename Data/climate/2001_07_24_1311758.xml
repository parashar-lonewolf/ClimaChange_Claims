        <p>President Bush said today that ''time is of the essence'' in his new arms talks with Moscow and warned that he would move ahead with testing missile shield technology even if he did not reach an agreement that would scrap the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's comments came only a day after he and President Vladimir V. Putin agreed to begin ''consultations'' that would tie deep cuts in the nuclear arsenals of both nations to the discussions on new defensive technologies.

        <p>President Bush said today that ''time is of the essence'' in his new arms talks with Moscow and warned that he would move ahead with testing missile shield technology even if he did not reach an agreement that would scrap the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's comments came only a day after he and President Vladimir V. Putin agreed to begin ''consultations'' that would tie deep cuts in the nuclear arsenals of both nations to the discussions on new defensive technologies. They were much more toughly worded than anything he had said publicly in Mr. Putin's presence in Genoa, Italy.</p>
        <p>Administration officials quickly reinforced the message, with Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Bush's national security adviser, saying that while Mr. Putin had not been given a time limit, the Pentagon was speeding toward a series of missile defense tests that were clearly prohibited by the 29-year-old accord.</p>
        <p>''We do not want to be in the position of being constantly accused of violating the treaty,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rice noted that ''presidents only have a limited amount of time to leave a legacy to their successors.'' Mr. Bush, she said, ''feels very strongly that we've lost a lot of time'' as previous presidents struggled to conduct tests within the limits of the treaty.</p>
        <p>In Moscow today, Mr. Putin's advisers argued that his agreeing to hold arms talks with Mr. Bush did not mean that he had dropped his adamant opposition to an antimissile system.</p>
        <p>But many in the Russian press thought otherwise today, saying the keystone of Russian policy, a refusal to change the 1972 treaty to permit construction of an American missile shield, had crumbled during the weekend talks.</p>
        <p>In remarks at his regular cabinet meeting today, Mr. Putin took pains to say that that was not so. ''Of course there has been no basic breakthrough,'' he said. ''We confirmed our commitment to the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. Nevertheless, there has been considerable progress.''</p>
        <p>He said Russian and American experts had agreed that questions about offensive and defense missile systems needed to be addressed jointly.</p>
        <p>The warning to Mr. Putin came in the midst of a state visit here by Mr. Bush that has swirled with some of the most difficult issues confronting his six-month-old presidency: his effort to convince Russia and Europe of the need for a new nuclear strategy, his confrontation with Europe and Japan over a pact limiting greenhouse gases, violent protests on globalization, and, today, Pope John Paul II's entry into the debate on stem cell research.</p>
        <p>After the tear gas clashes that surrounded the summit meeting of industrialized nations in Genoa, and after his position on global warming was roundly criticized by several of his allies, Mr. Bush looked relieved and delighted to arrive in Rome on Sunday night.</p>
        <p>He immediately visited the Roman Forum to see where the Senate met and to stand, as all visiting presidents and prime ministers must, at the altar of Julius Caesar.</p>
        <p>In a rather un-Caesar-like address, the president declared that Rome had a ''fantastic history'' and noted that ''so many of the words we use in America have come from right here.''</p>
        <p>Today Mr. Bush moved from ancient politics to the modern day, meeting with Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, with whom he appears to have developed a good rapport.</p>
        <p>Like Prime Minister Tony Blair in Britain last week, Mr. Berlusconi all but endorsed Mr. Bush's new framework for a post-cold-war security strategy. He chastised ''certain European states'' that have not ''understood how the world has changed.''</p>
        <p>But the highlight of Mr. Bush's day was clearly his visit to Castel Gandolfo, the pope's summer residence outside Rome.</p>
        <p>Even that visit was tinged with domestic American politics after the Pope publicly condemned all major forms of embryonic stem cell research, fully aware that Mr. Bush is considering whether to allow financing of the research to go forward.</p>
        <p>The president is not expected to make a decision on the research until next month at the earliest.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, his national security aides kept one eye on a drama playing out half a world away, in Indonesia. They were clearly relieved that the agonizingly slow removal of President Abdurrahman Wahid had come to an end, and that Megawati Sukarnoputri had been sworn in as Indonesia's president peacefully, even as Mr. Wahid stayed in his palace.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush interrupted his discussion of the American-Italian alliance during a news conference with Mr. Berlusconi to say that ''we look forward to working with President Megawati and her team,'' but warned that she must find a ''peaceful resolution'' to the separatist movements in Aceh and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>His aides hinted privately that they were looking for ways to resume economic assistance to Indonesia, which has effectively been frozen.</p>
        <p>But the main drama of late has been the dynamic between Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin on missile defense. Both men have described their relationship as friendly and cooperative, even trusting.</p>
        <p>But just as Mr. Putin left their first meeting, in Slovenia last month, and immediately declared that a violation of the ABM treaty by the United States would spark an arms race, Mr. Bush waited until Mr. Putin was out of Italian airspace to deliver the harder edge of his message.</p>
        <p>''I have told President Putin that time matters, that I want to reach an accord sooner, rather than later, that I'm interested in getting something done with him,'' Mr. Bush said at Villa Doria Pamphili, a 15th-century residence that Italian prime ministers use for such visits.</p>
        <p>Standing before a sweeping view of the city's ancient monuments, Mr. Bush spoke with far more passion about missile defense than he had on any of the other major topics of his visit.</p>
        <p>He repeated that ''America is no longer Russia's enemy,'' and said he believed that Mr. Putin and Europe's leaders were gradually coming to understand the need for what he called a ''strategic framework.''</p>
        <p>''You saw the president yesterday,'' he said to reporters, referring to Mr. Putin. ''I thought he was very forward-leaning, as they say in diplomatic nuanced circles.''</p>
        <p>''We signed an agreement,'' he said, apparently referring to a three-sentence statement that they would hold talks.</p>
        <p>But he also made clear that he had already decided what to do if those talks should fail: move ahead with the missile shield tests, even if that requires giving notice that the United States is withdrawing from the ABM treaty.</p>
        <p>''Since I feel it so strongly,'' he said, ''if we can't reach an agreement, we're going to implement'' the tests.</p>
        <p>''It's the right thing to do.'' he said. ''It's what I told the American people we're going to do. It's what I've explained to our allies we're going to do.''</p>
