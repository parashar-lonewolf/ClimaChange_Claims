        <p>As golden autumn sunlight bathed Central Park's Conservatory Garden the other day, the three maidens that dance perpetually in the garden's Untermeyer Fountain were getting scrubbed with something a little stronger.</p>
        <p>It was a chemical compound, mostly methyl pyrrolidone, specially formulated to peel a decade-old layer of protective lacquer from the bronze sculpture without wrecking the artwork or harming the pansies planted in wavy patterns nearby.</p>
        <p>And it was getting extra help from a three-person crew hired by the Central Park Conservancy to care for the park's 50 bronzes. Dressed in face masks and bright yellow rain suits, they sprayed the sculpture with the compound, sprayed it again with water and, perched like industrious sparrows on the fountain's rim, rubbed at areas of accumulated corrosion with fine-bristled wire brushes and ordinary-looking washcloths. A Grant for Maintenance</p>
        <p>It is a great time to be a bronze sculpture in New York, no matter how green with age or weather damage. The upkeep of such sculptures, some dating from the mid-19th century and installed in parks and public spaces across the city, has been made a separate-but-coordinated conservation priority by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation and by the privately financed Central Park Conservancy.</p>
        <p>For years fiscal constraints got in the way of regular maintenance and allowed acid rain, pigeon droppings and vandalism to eat away at the bronzes, which include works by the artists John Quincy Adams Ward and Samuel F. B. Morse. But two years ago, the Conservancy won a grant to start a maintenance and conservation program that will include all 50 bronze sculptures in the city's best-known park, and the Parks Department, which has had a maintenance program since the Depression but not always the money to support enough of it, began a similar program this summer for 19 bronzes around the city. No More Sandblasting</p>
        <p>The technology has changed markedly and always seems to be on the side of the sculpture these days. "People used to sandblast them, which is a terrible thing to do," said Jonathan Kuhn, curator of monuments and historian for the parks department. The new material of choice, Mr. Kuhn said, is walnut shells, ground to a powder and sprayed forcefully onto bronzes.</p>
        <p>"They were being used to clean the insides of airplane engines," Mr. Kuhn said, crediting their first use with bronze to the National Parks Service. "The shells are very soft. They have the ability to take off the dirt and corrosion without harming the bronze, and they're ecologically sound, too."</p>
        <p>Once the corrosion is removed, experts like Providencia Velazquez, the upkeep crew's coordinator, will examine a sculpture to see what should be done to preserve it. Often a layer or two of lacquer or wax is applied, which can stabilize the sculpture for years. Part of the job is researching the history of a particular sculpture, finding out what the artist intended it to look like. Sometimes the mellow greenish patina that had coated the broad bronze forehead of a prominent thinker memorialized in a city park is not what was intended, no matter how aesthetically appealing it may be.</p>
        <p>"We piece together a profile of the piece before we do the work," Mr. Kuhn said. Proposals for sculpture conservation must be approved by the city's Art Commission before work can begin, he added. But it is cost-effective to have an in-house team performing the work, he said: "When we contract out, it costs $10,000, and it's probably more like $3,000 to $5,000 when we do it." There are about 285 bronze sculptures and busts scattered throughout the city park system.</p>
        <p>This summer, the parks department restored a statue of a World War I doughboy that adorns Abingdon Square in the West Village. The sculpture, by Philip Martiny and executed in the 1920's, was first cleaned with walnut shells, Mr. Kuhn said, which removed the streaky black-and-green patina. Then the doughboy's resulting uneven color was evened with applications of hot wax, the repatination material used by the parks department, Mr. Kuhn said. (The Conservancy crew uses Incralac, a lacquer that inhibits corrosion.) The stone base was repointed, and the inscription was patched in places.</p>
        <p>All this failed to change Karl Klauser's opinion of the work, although he did say it looked a little better. "I've always hated it -- I think it's a terrible sculpture," said Mr. Klauser, a neighborhood resident, who was sitting near the statue on a park bench the other day.</p>
        <p>The other sculptures proposed for restoration were selected because they were not picked up by private benefactors in the city's Adopt-a-Monument program, begun in the late 1980's, and because they were either prominent or simply in dire straits, Mr. Kuhn said.</p>
