        <p>'ASYLUM: THE STRANGE CASE OF MARY LINCOLN' Opens on Thursday.

Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983, impactfestival.org.</p>
        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, best play and best direction of a play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE WEDDING SINGER'  An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Constantine Maroulis, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'GARDEL: THE MUSICAL' A standard-issue bio-musical about the tango legend Carlos Gardel that wallows in melodrama (1:30). Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, (212) 225-9920. (Jason Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'NO CHILD'  Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates)</p>
        <p>* 'SEVEN GUITARS' (2:45). Life and death dance cheek to cheek in this fine new revival of August Wilson's drama from 1996. Directed by Ruben Santiago-Hudson, and acted with absorbing restraint and immediacy, this is a truly life-size production, which means it is big indeed (2:45). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'SHOUT!' A miniskirted, go-go-booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the showroom of a Carnival cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)</p>
        <p>* '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>Spectacles</p>
        <p>'ABSINTHE' Think Cirque du Soleil as channeled through ''Rocky Horror'' and painted by George Grosz. Part cabaret, part circus, ''Absinthe'' aims for a kind of seedy decadence that's mingled with the simple, aw-shucks wonder of knife-jugglers, sword-swallowers and a man creating constructions out of soap bubbles. It's the main event at the Spiegeltent, a vintage European tradition visiting South Street Seaport this summer (1:30). Spiegeltent, at the former Fulton Fish Market site, Pier 17, South Street, under the Brooklyn Bridge, (212) 279-4200. (Anne Midgette)</p>
        <p>'REVEREND BILLY AND THE CHURCH OF STOP-SHOPPING' Reverend Billy (a k a the performance artist Bill Talen) struts and preaches his way across the Spiegeltent stage accompanied by a choir and a fine seven-piece band. Radical political theater has rarely been more thoughtful or fun (1:30). Spiegeltent, at the former Fulton Fish Market site, Pier 17, South Street, under the Brooklyn Bridge, (212) 279-4200. (George Hunka)</p>
        <p>Long-Running Shows</p>
        <p>* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). 2005 New World Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)</p>
        <p>'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)</p>
        <p>'SPAMALOT'  A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans. (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>'CREATION: A CLOWN SHOW' Lucas Caleb Rooney is a cross between Red Skelton and Will Ferrell in this sweet, funny, poignant, mostly one-man show about the biblical story of earth's first seven days (1:15). Theater Five, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444; closing on Sunday. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'HENRIK IBSEN + JON FOSSE: NORWAY MEETS NEW YORK' Ibsen's late-19th-century ''Rosmersholm'' and Fosse's contemporary ''deathvariations'' both deal with suicide, among other life dramas. The Ibsen has problems, but the Fosse is often stunning and fiercely poetic (2:00 and 1:15). At the 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Gates)</p>
        <p>* 'KIKI AND HERB: ALIVE ON BROADWAY' This transcendental lounge act -- made up of Kiki (Justin Bond), a molting songbird for all seasons, and Herb (Kenny Mellman), her happily suffering shadow and accompanist -- has the heat and dazzle of great balls of fire. Vital, funny and surprisingly affecting (2:00). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MR. DOOLEY'S AMERICA' Martin J. Dooley, the wisest fictional pub owner in 1890's Chicago, brings his old newspaper columns back to life with funny, surprisingly timely issues-of-the-day commentary in this likable two-man play (1:40). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737; closing on Sunday. (Gates)</p>
        <p>Movies</p>
        <p>Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.</p>
        <p>'ACCEPTED' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A clever slacker and his oddball crew invent a phony college in this passable example of that oxymoronic genre, the Hollywood comedy about sticking it to the man. (Nathan Lee)</p>
        <p>'THE ANT BULLY' (PG, 90 minutes) A young boy goes to live among the ants, who talk remarkably like Academy Award-winning actors. (A. O. Scott)</p>
        <p>'BARNYARD' (PG, 88 minutes) The barnyard animals in this crude 3-D animation walk, talk and party down like human beings. Way too often the male ''cows,'' as the film calls them, also flash their udders. (Manohla Dargis)</p>
        <p>'BEERFEST' (R, 110 minutes) In ''Beerfest,'' a gaseous celebration of binge drinking and family honor, the five comedians known collectively as Broken Lizard head for Munich and an underground beer-guzzling contest. Best viewed while sloshed, the movie is idiotic, tasteless and irrepressibly good-natured: in other words, a frat-house classic. (Jeannette Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'BOYNTON BEACH CLUB' (No rating, 104 minutes) A fast-paced romantic comedy about frisky 60-something residents of a Florida ''active adult'' community, ''Boynton Beach Club'' is a rose-colored fantasy about aging that has just enough credibility to make you care about its characters and wish them merrily on their way. (Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>'CARS' (G, 114 minutes) The latest 3-D toon from Pixar just putt-putt-putts along, a shining model of technological progress and consumer safety. John Lasseter directed, and Owen Wilson provides the voice of the little red race car who learns all the right lessons from, among others, a 1951 Hudson Hornet given voice by Paul Newman. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'The Celestine Prophecy' (PG, 100 minutes) A delectable fusion of New Age babble and luridly bad filmmaking based on the best-selling book by James Redfield. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'CLICK' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Adam Sandler stars in this unfunny comedy about a harried family man who uses a universal remote to hop-scotch through time. It's a wonderful life, not. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER WOMEN' (No rating, 84 minutes) Two old flames meet, years after parting, and have a short fling. An arch, banal conceit, of some interest for Aaron Eckhart and Helena Bonham Carter's performances and the split-screen gimmick that keeps them apart even in their intimate moments. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'CRANK' (R, 83 minutes) A poisoned hit man rampages in Los Angeles, doling revenge on his nemesis and misanthropy on all. Basically a broken-down retread of ''Speed,'' with Jason Stratham as the bus. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'CROSSOVER' (PG-13, 95 minutes) Bling is bad, and friends are good in this story of temptation, rivalry and cheerleaders, set in the world of Detroit street basketball. (Lee)</p>
        <p>* 'THE DESCENT' (R, 99 minutes) A total horror freakout from the British writer and director Neil Marshall about six women on a caving expedition who meet their fears and some scary monsters, too. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA' (PG-13, 106 minutes) Lauren Weisberger's score-settling best seller about a terrible (and famous) boss is reimagined and reversed. Anne Hathaway plays the beleaguered assistant, but she is much less interesting -- and in the end less sympathetic -- than the boss, Miranda Priestly, incarnated by Meryl Streep as a subtle and searching (and very funny) portrait of glamour and power. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'FACTOTUM' (R, 94 minutes) Matt Dillon goes deep to play Henry Chinaski, the familiar alter ego of the great Charles Bukowski, who survived countless benders, brawls, rejection slips, crazy women and soul-killing jobs. The Norwegian filmmaker Bent Hamer directed. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'Gabrielle' (No rating, 90 minutes) A film of eccentric beauty and wild feeling, directed by the consistently inventive Patrice Chéreau and starring the supremely well-matched Pascal Greggory and Isabelle Huppert, about the dissolution of a haut-bourgeois Parisian marriage, around 1912. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'Half Nelson' (R, 107 minutes) In their beautiful bummer about the relationship between a white teacher (Ryan Gosling) and a black student (Shareeka Epps), the gifted young director Ryan Fleck and his writing partner, Anna Boden, offer a lament for the radical fires of the 1960's and a suggestion for life and politics after the new left. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'HEADING SOUTH' (No rating, 105 minutes, in English and French) Sex tourism involving middle-aged white women and black beach boys at a Haitian resort in the late 1970's is the subject of Laurent Cantet's third film, one of the most truthful explorations of desire, age and youth ever filmed, with a politically charged subtext about capitalist imperialism. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'HOW TO EAT FRIED WORMS' (PG, 98 minutes) The worms go in, the worms go out, but mostly the worms go into the frying pan in Bob Dolman's engaging and yucky adaptation of the Thomas Rockwell book. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'HOUSE OF SAND' (R, 115 minutes, in Portuguese) Beautifully shot in a sandy, remote corner of northern Brazil, this film tells the story of three generations of women, all of them played by Fernanda Montenegro and Fernanda Torres, mother and daughter in real life and two of the national treasures of Brazilian cinema. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'IDLEWILD' (R, 120 minutes) André Benjamin and Antwan A. Patton, a k a André 3000 and Big Boi of OutKast, play friends living and sometimes singing in Depression-era Georgia. The joint doesn't jump; it twitches and stumbles. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'THE ILLUSIONIST' (PG-13, 109 minutes) This film tells the story of Eisenheim (Edward Norton), a fictional conjurer who enraptured Viennese audiences in 1900 with his supernatural magic shows. A terrific yarn, it rouses your slumbering belief in the miraculous. (Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'INVINCIBLE' (PG, 99 minutes) The latest addition to the Disney stable of sports-underdog movies, ''Invincible'' is the true story of Vince Papale (Mark Wahlberg), a substitute teacher and part-time bartender, who in 1976 realizes his dream of playing for the Philadelphia Eagles. While Disney piles on the uplift, the director and cinematographer, Ericson Core, counters the story's predictably inspirational trajectory with close attention to historical detail and blue-collar hardship. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'LASSIE' (PG, 100 minutes) Everything old is new again in the 11th film about the beloved pooch with the I.Q. of a grad student and the instincts of a boomerang. Blissfully restored to the period and location of Eric Knight's original novel -- pre-World War Britain -- the movie balances humor and pathos with old-fashioned charm and not a trace of satire. Progressive adults may balk at the film's ultimate capitulation to the power of patronage, but tykes will just be happy that Lassie has come home once more to the multiplex where she belongs. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'LADY IN THE WATER' (PG-13, 108 minutes) In this watchable folly, Paul Giamatti plays a building manager who encounters a menagerie of otherworldly creatures, most important Bryce Dallas Howard's water nymph. The writer and director M. Night Shyamalan wants us to believe, mostly in the myth of his own genius. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'LITTLE MAN' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A belligerent midget jewel thief assaults groins and molests women in this infantile comedy from the Wayans brothers. (Lee)</p>
        <p>* 'Little Miss Sunshine' (R, 101 minutes) A bittersweet comedy of dysfunction that takes place at the terminus of the American dream. The excellent cast includes Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano and that national treasure, Alan Arkin. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'MATERIAL GIRLS' (PG, 97 minutes) The real-life sisters Hilary and Haylie Duff star in this incompetent spin on the poor-little-rich-girl story from, alas, Martha Coolidge. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'MIAMI VICE' (R, 133 minutes) This updating of the 1980's television series cost more than the annual budget of the real-life Miami Police Department, making it the most expensive experimental art film ever made. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'MONSTER HOUSE' (PG, 86 minutes) This scary movie for kids provides more fun in 86 minutes than all the other would-be summer blockbusters combined. Three intrepid youngsters face down a demonic dwelling in a quiet suburb. The motion-capture animation produces an uncanny feeling of realism, while the fantastical effects are spooky, witty and spectacular. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' (PG-13, 151 minutes) Although there are memorable bits and pieces, this is a movie with no particular interest in coherence, economy or feeling. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'PRINCESAS' (No rating, 109 minutes, in Spanish) This maudlin melodrama about prostitutes in Madrid is not, alas, the new film by Pedro Almodóvar, but a dilution of his manner by the writer-director Fernando León de Aranoa. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'Pulse' (PG-13, 87 minutes) Evil technology menaces idiotic teenagers in this cynical remake of a Japanese horror film. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'QUEENS' (No rating, 107 minutes, in Spanish) A dithering but generous Spanish farce, ''Queens'' follows the forthcoming nuptials of three gay couples by focusing on their overbearing mothers. While the sons dance, bicker and fret over antiques, the mamas express their discomfort with the wedding plans by seducing inappropriate men. Despite obvious nods to Pedro Almodóvar, ''Queens'' is notable only for its unadulterated worship of middle-aged women. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'THE QUIET' (R, 96 minutes) Neither ambitious enough to take seriously nor sleazy enough to enjoy, Jamie Babbit's good-girl, bad-girl face-off flirts with the trappings of exploitation cinema without going all the way. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'QUINCEAÑERA' (R, 90 minutes) This portrait of a Mexican-American family living in a Latino neighborhood of Los Angeles is as smart and warm-hearted an exploration of an upwardly mobile immigrant culture as American independent cinema has produced. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'RIDING ALONE FOR THOUSANDS OF MILES' (PG, 108 minutes, in Mandarin) Zhang Yimou takes a pause between marital-arts extravaganzas with this simple, affecting melodrama about a mournful Japanese patriarch on an odyssey through rural China. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'A SCANNER DARKLY' (R, 100 minutes) Identities shift and melt like shadows in Richard Linklater's animated adaptation of the Philip K. Dick semispeculative novel ''A Scanner Darkly,'' a look at a future that appears an awful lot like today. With the voices and gestures of Keanu Reeves, Woody Harrelson, Winona Ryder and a wonderful Robert Downey Jr. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'Scoop' (PG-13, 96 minutes) A not especially funny yet oddly appealing comedy in which Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson make like Nick and Nora, but with more shtick and no martinis (or Asta). (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'SNAKES ON A PLANE' (R, 105 minutes) Snakes + plane + Samuel L. Jackson. David R. Ellis provides the fine B-movie-style direction, while Mr. Jackson supplies the cool and his trademark 13-letter epithet. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'STEP UP' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Ever since Kevin Bacon's rebellious hips ignited a small-town uproar in ''Footloose,'' the modern high school romance has placed a premium on rhythm. In ''Step Up'' a rough Baltimore kid (Channing Tatum), armed only with a killer smile and hip-hop moves, falls for a classically trained dancer (Jenna Dewan). Bland but likable, the movie fashions social equality from big musical numbers. If ballet and hip-hop can coexist, it asks, why can't we all be friends? (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'STRANGERS WITH CANDY' (R, 87 minutes) High school high jinks, adapted from the beloved Comedy Central series. The comedy is stretched a little thin by the feature length, but there are still some laughs. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'MY SUPER EX-GIRLFRIEND' (PG-13, 110 minutes) A shaky comedy from the director Ivan Reitman, in which ''Fatal Attraction'' meets ''Wonder Woman,'' by way of Uma Thurman, Luke Wilson and some sexist she-devil clichés, some funny, others not. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'SUPERMAN RETURNS' (PG-13, 157 minutes) Last seen larking about on the big screen in the 1987 dud ''Superman IV,'' the Man of Steel has been resurrected in Bryan Singer's leaden new film not only to fight for truth, justice and the American way, but also to give Mel Gibson's passion a run for his box-office money. Where once the superhero flew up, up and away, he now flies down, down, down, sent from above to save mankind from its sins and another bummer summer. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'TALLADEGA NIGHTS: THE BALLAD OF RICKY BOBBY' (PG-13, 110 minutes) Fast, fun and silly, with Will Ferrell as a Nascar driver, Sacha Baron Cohen as his nemesis, and a new course record for product placements per gallon. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'13 Tzameti'  (No rating, 90 minutes) The flashy black-and-white directorial debut of the Georgian filmmaker Gela Babluani is a sadistic, arty thriller that suggests a French New Wave film infected by a virulent strain of Eastern European nihilism. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'TRUST THE MAN' (R, 101 minutes) A strained, flatulent relationship comedy about two couples, from the writer and director Bart Freundlich. With Julianne Moore, David Duchovny, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Billy Crudup. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'ANDY WARHOL: A DOCUMENTARY FILM' (No rating, 4 hours with an intermission) Ric Burns's absorbing four-hour critical biography of this seminal Pop artist is devoted to the proposition that Warhol was the greatest artist of the second half of the 20th century, as Picasso was in the first. It makes a mostly persuasive, highly entertaining case for that claim. (Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'WORLD TRADE CENTER' (PG-13, 129 minutes) From Oliver Stone, a return to the emotions of 9/11. Powerful and almost unbearably moving. (Scott)</p>
        <p>Film Series</p>
        <p>THE BEST OF NEWFEST (Through Sunday) BAMcinématek's selection of 10 films from the 18th annual New York Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender Film Festival, held in June, begins tonight.

(Gates)</p>
        <p>THE SUPPORTING CAST: AS BRIGHT AS THE STARS (Through Sept. 26) Symphony Space's series of double features honoring the names well below the title continues on Sunday and Tuesday. The noirish ''Leave Her to Heaven'' (1945), whose supporting actors include Jeanne Crain and Vincent Price, will be shown with ''Written on the Wind'' (1956), for which Dorothy Malone, as a self-destructive rich girl, won the best-supporting-actress Oscar. 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $10. (Gates)</p>
        <p>JOSEF VON STERNBERG RETROSPECTIVE (Through Oct. 8) The Museum of the Moving Image's monthlong tribute to Josef von Sternberg (1894-1969), the Vienna-born director who played Svengali to Marlene Dietrich, begins tonight.

        <p>Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.</p>
        <p>BAND OF HORSES (Sunday and Monday) With shimmering guitars that build from teardrops to epic heights and wraithlike, death-obsessed vocals (''At every occasion I'll be ready for the funeral''), this Seattle band's songs both soar and sulk. At 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $17 in advance, $18 at the door. (Ben Sisario)</p>
        <p>BEAUSOLEIL (Monday) Michael Doucet's band, Beausoleil, is the Cajun revival incarnate, determined both to preserve and extend bayou traditions. Mr. Doucet learned the scratch and drone of his fiddle style from the masters of Cajun and Creole music, and he's equally at home playing an old-fashioned two-step or rowdy swamp rock. At 7:30 p.m., with a free dance lesson at 6:30, Connolly's, 121 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-7597, letszydeco.com; $25. (Jon Pareles)</p>
        <p>JEFF BECK (Tuesday) The British Invasion guitar god, who may or may not have been satirized as Nigel Tufnel in the film ''This Is Spinal Tap,'' is on an unexpected but not unwelcome solo tour. At 6:30 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, mcstudios.com; $45 and $75. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>BORIS; PEARLS AND BRASS (Monday and Tuesday) And on a certain beer-buzzed day (whose ordinal number is forgotten), Deep Purple, the James Gang and Black Sabbath created fuzzy, head-nodding biker metal, and it was good. Many begats later, Pearls and Brass, a trio from Nazareth, Pa., is worshiping studiously at their altar, while Boris, a three-piece from Japan, warps and refracts the same influences in ways that can amplify their power or just make them really noisy and repetitious. Monday at 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; Tuesday at 9 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>BRAZILIAN GIRLS (Thursday) Electronica, a live rhythm section and a wildly cosmopolitan spirit meet a charismatic and unpredictable singer, Sabina Sciubba, in the Brazilian Girls. The music dips into reggae, samba, funk and house, never staying in one place for long. At 10 p.m., Spiegeltent, Fulton Fish Market, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, spiegelworld.com; $30. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>BROOKLYN COUNTRY MUSIC FESTIVAL (Tomorrow) Though it may be stretching things a bit to call a one-night club gig a festival, this third annual event has a strong lineup of local honky-tonkers, among them Greg Garing, a stalwart of the New York country scene; the Demolition String Band, from Hoboken, N.J., which does a bluegrass version of Madonna's ''Like a Prayer''; and the Defibulators, who also know how to pick with a wink in songs like ''Armageddon Boogie.'' Others on the bill include Uncle Leon and the Alibis, the Wissler Family, Sweet William, Alex Battles's Whisky Rebellion, Kara Suzanne and the Gojo Hearts and the Lonesome Prairie Dogs. Beginning at 4 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, (718) 230-0236, brooklyncountrymusic.com or spsounds.com; $10. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* CAT POWER AND THE MEMPHIS RHYTHM BAND (Sunday) For her most recent album, ''The Greatest'' (Matador), Chan Marshall, the superbly rueful singer known as Cat Power, recorded in Memphis with a group of veteran soul players. The strutting rhythms, tender guitars and happy horns give her an expressive new vocabulary of sorrows, loves and joys; she hasn't sounded so inspired in years. At 6:30 and 10:30 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $27.50 in advance, $30 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>GEORGE CLINTON AND THE P-FUNK ALL-STARS (Sunday) George Clinton's long-running band has become an American institution, using funk to subvert and outflank any Puritan reflexes. As P-Funk's leisurely jams amble from bubbling-mud funk to slow-grinding blues-rock to bits of doo-wop, jazz and hip-hop, the music is tight and loose at the same time. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $37.50 in advance, $42 at the door. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>COMETS ON FIRE (Tonight) Serving as a reminder that psychedelic rock was as much about testosterone-flooded blues jams as about tangerine trees and marmalade skies, Comets on Fire, from Santa Cruz, Calif., reaches back to the loud legacy of Blue Cheer. With Soldiers of Fortune and Blues Control. At 11, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $14. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>DEATH VESSEL (Monday) As Death Vessel, Joel Thibodeau, a transplant to Brooklyn from the low-fi scene in Providence, R.I., sings bittersweet, bluegrass-inspired elegies in a hauntingly high, almost feminine voice. With Dilly Dilly and Fence Kitchen. At 9 p.m., Pete's Candy Store, 709 Lorimer Street, between Frost and Richardson Streets, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 302-3770, petescandystore.com; free. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>DEVOTCHKA (Tonight and tomorrow night) DeVotchKa, from Denver, is the most musically versatile band of the Gypsy-punk trendlet of the last few years. It does its share of wild fiddling and rug-cutting, but also plays moody, carefully textured ballads that can recall the Tindersticks. At midnight, Spiegeltent, Fulton Fish Market, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, spiegelworld.com; $20. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* DR. OCTAGON, MR. LIF, BEANS (Tomorrow and Sunday) Kool Keith was already one of the most eccentric figures in rap when he unveiled his Dr. Octagon project a decade ago. But with one brilliantly bizarre album he instantly trumped all as the most clever and twisted mind in the game, his non sequiturs revealing both raunchiness and a kind of innocence. Kool Keith recently released ''The Return of Dr. Octagon'' (OCD); it's no classic, but a good excuse for him to revisit the character. Also on the bill are two of underground rap's best: Mr. Lif, a politically minded M.C. from Boston, and Beans, formerly of New York's Antipop Consortium. Tomorrow at 9 p.m., Sunday at 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $22 in advance, $24 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>GOV'T MULE, WOLFMOTHER (Tomorrow) The last concert at McCarren Park Pool this season features Gov't Mule, the Southern-rock-meets-Led-Zeppelin band led by the Allman Brothers guitarist Warren Haynes; and Wolfmother, an Australian group whose retro wayback machine stops at screamy mid-60's garage rock and then forwards a few years to the proto-metal bacchanals of Black Sabbath. Also on the bill is Two Gallants. At 4 p.m., Lorimer Street, between Driggs Avenue and Bayard Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (212) 307-7171; $38.50 in advance, $45 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>PAUL GREEN SCHOOL OF ROCK MUSIC (Today and tomorrow) As seen in the documentary ''Rock School,'' Mr. Green offers an extensive rock curriculum at his school in Philadelphia, teaching youngsters the fundamentals of power chords and budda-budda bass lines. The students have made frequent visits to CBGB, and today and tomorrow afternoon show off their mastery of the works of Van Halen. 5 p.m., 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052, cbgb.com; $10. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>JOE LALLY (Tuesday) Mr. Lally's smooth and beautifully muscular bass lines steadied the sound of Fugazi, the alt-rock granddaddies from Washington, D.C. His first solo album, recorded while Fugazi is on hiatus, is due next month. With Antelope. At 8 p.m., Tap Bar, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $8. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* MASTODON (Tonight) Until Mastodon released ''Leviathan'' two years ago, the world lacked an extreme metal album based on Melville's ''Moby-Dick''; thankfully, it's an extraordinary piece of work, dense and exhilarating and fully attentive to every slashing sonic detail, as is the band's new album, ''Blood Mountain'' (Warner Brothers), to be released on Tuesday. With Converge, from Salem, Mass., and the Bronx, from Los Angeles. At 6, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $17. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>ASHA PUTHLI (Wednesday) A trailblazing Indian singer who has performed with everybody from Ornette Coleman to Ashford and Simpson, Ms. Puthli makes a rare appearance: this summer she played New York for the first time in 25 years in an abbreviated set at Central Park SummerStage. At 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com; $15 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>RADIO BIRDMAN (Tonight) In the mid-70's, Radio Birdman kick-started the Australian punk scene with a brawny, speedy style drawn from Detroit groups like the MC5 and the Stooges. (Not a coincidence: one of Radio Birdman's guitarists, Deniz Tek, grew up in Ann Arbor, Mich.) Thirty years after its first record, the band makes its New York debut. With the Rogers Sisters and Easy Action. At 9, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $25. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>ROGUE WAVE (Wednesday) Harking back to the weepy and grandiose shoe-gazer bands of the late 80's and early 90's, like My Bloody Valentine, Rogue Wave, from Oakland, Calif., paints dreamily noisy washes with distorted guitars and maudlin pillow talk (''You can never publish my love''). With Jason Collett. At 8 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; $15. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>SHAKIRA, WYCLEF JEAN (Tonight) Their flirty duet ''Hips Don't Lie'' was one of the biggest hits of the summer, perhaps because its odd stabs at political commentary (''Why the C.I.A. wanna watch us?/ Colombians and Haitians/ I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction,'' Mr. Jean raps) are no match for its old-fashioned, steamy body language (''I'm on tonight/ My hips don't lie/ And I am starting to feel you, boy,'' Shakira replies). At 8, Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $19.50 to $129.50. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>MARTA TOPFEROVA (Tuesday) A Czech singer whose heart is in Latin American music, Ms. Topferova dips into styles from across the Caribbean and South America -- Cuban son, Venezuelan joropo, Puerto Rican bomba -- plays the small Caribbean guitar called a cuatro and sings with an elegant longing in her voice. At 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com; $15. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>* M. WARD, OAKLEY HALL (Thursday) On his mesmerizing new album, ''Post-War'' (Merge), M. Ward mingles political indignation, however oblique (''He was a good man and now he's gone,'' goes ''Requiem,'' about a fallen soldier), with a languid, surrealistic melancholy. Oakley Hall, from Brooklyn, mutates patient country-folk into dense, psychedelic drones. At 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $20. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>ROGER WATERS (Tuesday and Wednesday) It's been two months since the death of Syd Barrett, Pink Floyd's first leader and an inventor of psychedelic rock, as well as one of the most famous casualties of its lifestyle. Now Mr. Waters, billing himself as ''the creative genius of Pink Floyd,'' is touring with a live version of ''The Dark Side of the Moon,'' the band's epochal 1973 concept album about insanity. At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; sold out. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>THE WHO (Wednesday) Down to just Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey (with hired guns), the Who has made an ambitious play by recording its first new album in 24 years, to be released next month. But the real surprise is just how good it is; based on ''Wire &amp; Glass,'' the teaser EP released in Britain this summer, it is a throwback to the expansive, rock-opera brilliance of ''Quadrophenia.'' With Peeping Tom. At 8 p.m., Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000, nikonjonesbeach.com; $58.50 to $258.50. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>WIDESPREAD PANIC (Thursday) Widespread Panic, from Georgia, leans toward the Southern-rock side of the Allman Brothers-Grateful Dead axis, but like any good jam band, it's flexible and then some. At 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $50. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>WORLD PARTY (Tomorrow) For a few albums as World Party in the 1980's and 90's, Karl Wallinger borrowed worshipfully and unapologetically from the holy texts of 60's rock -- Beatles, Stones, Dylan, Beach Boys -- prefiguring the now-omnipresent retro-rock trend. He recently returned after a long recovery from a debilitating aneurysm, and has rejiggered his last album, ''Dumbing Up'' (Seaview), for rerelease. With Gina Villalobos. At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $30 in advance, $35 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>Jazz</p>
        <p>Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.</p>
        <p>BEN ALLISON QUARTET (Wednesday) Ben Allison, a bassist and composer, has a knack for assembling hardy and sophisticated ensembles like this one, with Ron Horton on trumpet, Steve Cardenas on guitar and Mike Sarin on drums. At 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, near Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 929-9883, 55bar.com; cover, $8. (Nate Chinen)</p>
        <p>AN ESOTERIC NIGHT: BENEFIT FOR TOM TERRELL (Monday) Mr. Terrell, a music journalist with eclectic tastes and unexpected health concerns, serves as a common cause for a staggeringly broad roster of artists, including the singer-songwriters Marc Anthony Thompson and Angélique Kidjo; the jazz pianists Kenny Barron and Marc Cary; the experimental rock guitarist Vernon Reid; and the turntable artists Eric Hilton, of Thievery Corporation, and Joe Claussell. At 7 p.m., Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, TriBeCa, (212) 941-8100, canalroom.com; cover, $20. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>BABY LOVES JAZZ (Tomorrow) Verve recently released ''Go Baby Go,'' a jazz primer for children that's a lot less cloying than it could be. Among the artists involved are the singers Sharon Jones and Babi Floyd, the keyboardist John Medeski and the trumpeter Steven Bernstein, who all appear together at these Saturday matinees. At 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778, joespub.com; cover, $15; free for children under 2. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>THE BAD PLUS/JASON MORAN AND THE BANDWAGON (Tuesday through Thursday) Two trios, both plumbing the territory between melodic abstraction and gut-level groove, both featuring an erudite pianist and both involving a turbulent and unconventional drummer.

        <p>TONY MALABY TUBA TRIO (Wednesday) Tony Malaby, a versatile and increasingly prominent tenor saxophonist, convenes an exploratory trio with Marcus Rojas on tuba and John Hollenbeck on drums and percussion; the name of the trio is appropriate, given the central role that Mr. Rojas assumes.

        <p>* PAUL MOTIAN, JOE LOVANO, BILL FRISELL (Through Thursday) Mr. Motian, a drummer and composer, sets a tone for this blue-chip trio that's shadowy, slippery and as open-ended as a koan; his longtime partners are Joe Lovano on tenor and soprano saxophones and Bill Frisell on guitar. There's no better place to see them than at the Village Vanguard, where they've fruitfully recorded. (Through Sept. 17.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>

        <p>JOHN SCOFIELD REAL JAZZ TRIO (Through Sunday) The guitarist John Scofield has extensive history with the bassist Steve Swallow and the drummer Bill Stewart, and they recently made a superb album at the Note, ''EnRoute'' (Verve). You suspect that the name being applied to the trio here wasn't Mr. Scofield's idea -- would he describe his funkier projects as ''fake jazz''? -- but in any case, the music will be jazz, and powerfully real. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>* SOUND OF THE SORCERER: THE MUSIC OF HERMETO PASCOAL (Tomorrow) The influence of the visionary Brazilian composer Hermeto Pascoal has traveled far and wide, and this evening it will animate two different ensembles. The first is a chamber group led by the Brazilian pianist and flutist Jovino Santos Neto, featuring Paquito D'Rivera on clarinet and Mike Marshall on mandolin; the second is a big band led by the percussionist Bobby Sanabria that will give some of Mr. Pascoal's music its United States premiere.

Romero Lubambo, the guitarist, is more than an accompanist: providing intricate counterpoint and rhythmic undertow, he is Ms. Souza's equal. (Through Sept. 17.) At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard , 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $25. (Chinen)</p>

        <p>MIGUEL ZENÓN AND THE RHYTHM COLLECTIVE (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Zenón, a serious-minded young alto saxophonist from Puerto Rico, leads an aptly named ensemble of musicians with a similar cultural heritage: Aldemar Valentin on electric bass, Reynaldo deJesus on hand percussion and Tony Escapa on drums.

        <p>* JOHN ZORN AND THE BOOK OF ANGELS (Sunday) The Oy!Hoo Festival -- also known as the New York Jewish Music and Heritage Festival -- kicks off with this kaleidoscopic tour through ''The Book of Angels,'' a body of 300 works composed by John Zorn during an apparently feverish three-month span. Mr. Zorn will play alto saxophone in Masada, his original avant-garde klezmer quartet, and with Electric Masada, his eight-piece improvising chamber group. And he will conduct both the Masada String Trio and the Kol Nidre String Orchestra, an ensemble named after the sacred Jewish prayer.

        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>* 'LA BOHÈME' AND 'CARMEN' (Tonight through Sunday) If promoters and presenters of classical music need proof that the steep cost of tickets discourages people, especially younger ones, from attending, they should stop by Lincoln Center for the New York City Opera's ''Opera-for-All'' programs. This weekend the series, introduced at the beginning of last season, offers the company's productions of Puccini's ''Bohème'' and Bizet's ''Carmen'' priced at $25 a seat, for any seat in the house. Tickets are sold on a first-come-first-served basis. Last year, the company reports, 71 percent of the audiences for ''Opera-for-All'' events had never been to the City Opera before. The productions tend to feature young, eager and attractive singers in stagings that emphasize opera as a vivid form of theater. Rinat Shaham sings the title role in ''Carmen'' (tomorrow night at 8); James Robinson's updated production of ''La Bohème'' features Shu-Ying Li as Mimi and James Valenti in his company debut as Rodolfo (tonight at 8 and Sunday at 1:30 p.m.). New York State Theater, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com. (Anthony Tommasini)</p>
        <p>* 'SEMELE' (Wednesday) In the last 15 years the New York City Opera has become a haven for Handel. This season the company presents the New York stage premiere of ''Semele,'' a work the composer conceived and presented as a dramatic oratorio, though in the 20th century it was effectively staged. The City Opera's new production is by the director Stephen Lawless. The brilliant coloratura soprano Elizabeth Futral sings the title role. The charismatic mezzo-soprano Vivica Genaux, who has performed at the Metropolitan Opera and other major international companies, sings Juno. The impressive cast also includes Constance Hauman and Sanford Sylvan. Anthony Walker conducts. At 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125.

        <p>Classical Music</p>
        <p>BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Monday, and Thursday) The weekend on Brooklyn's favorite floating concert hall begins with the second of two performances by the fine pianists Ursula Oppens and Jerome Lowenthal in an entertaining program of Mozart and variations on Wagner; it continues with a performance by the Shanghai String Quartet: works by Turina and Zhou Long, and string quartets by Barber and Ravel.

(Anne Midgette)</p>
        <p>ANDREA BOCELLI (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Bocelli occupies a small, glamorous and highly profitable space between grand opera and public entertainment. His personality and slight tenor voice have won him a big following, as witnessed by four sold-out concerts at Avery Fisher Hall, the last two of which are tonight and tomorrow night. Asher Fisch conducts the New York Philharmonic in this program of operatic favorites. At 8, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org. (Bernard Holland)</p>

        <p>ETHEL (Tuesday) Funky and genre-defying, Ethel is the rock band of string quartets -- the term ''classical'' hardly applies to its brand of eclectic, hip music. The ensemble is celebrating the release of its second CD, ''Light'' (Canteloupe Records), with a concert featuring a mix of so-called EthelFaves (top requests from previous concerts) and new music; the CD includes compositions by Don Byron, Pamela Z, Mary Ellen Childs, Marcelo Zarvos, you name it. Audiences may not know exactly what hit them, but they usually like it. At 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com; $15. (Midgette)</p>

        <p>JENNY LIN (Tuesday) A smart musician, in the best sense of both words, Ms. Lin is forging a fine career exactly on her own terms, which include a strong commitment to contemporary and less-known music. Her canny program for the Austrian Cultural Forum's ''Mostly Modern'' festival balances Austrian and American composers, modern and contemporary: two 20th-century classics, Barber and Berg; two strong women, Ruth Crawford Seeger and Olga Neuwirth; and two young contemporary composers, Randy Nordschow and Johannes Maria Staud. At 8 p.m., 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 319-5300, Ext. 222, acfny.org; free, but tickets are required. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Wednesday and Thursday) After its preseason programs with the crossover sensation Andrea Bocelli, the Philharmonic under its music director Lorin Maazel opens its formal season on Wednesday. True to tradition, this gala offers familiar fare, Beethoven's ''Egmont'' Overture and ''Eroica'' Symphony. Mozart's joyous Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra in E flat, which does not turn up as often as it might, is the one novelty. The soloists in the concerto will be Emanuel Ax and Yefim Bronfman, who besides being excellent pianists, are also friends and New York neighbors. The music director, Lorin Maazel, conducts. Starting on Thursday night in the first subscription series program of the season, Mr. Maazel and his players offer more intriguing fare, with the American premiere of Hans Werner Henze's ''Sebastian im Traum''; Ravel's sultry ''Rapsodie Espagnole''; Stravinsky's ''Firebird'' Suite; and Bruch's most popular work, the Violin Concerto in G minor, with Itzhak Perlman as soloist. (There are three more performances of Thursday's program through Sept. 19.) At 7:30, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $85 tickets remaining on Wednesday, sold out on Thursday. (Tommasini)</p>

        <p>THE BROOKLYN ADULT RECORDER CHOIR (Thursday) The name of this group turns out to be literal description rather than whimsy: a self-described ''ad-hoc group'' of some 60 performers trying to recapture the joys of those painful recorder lessons at school during ''In the Closet, Again, Again.'' The choreographer Beth Gill and the composer Chris Peck thought this up. From 7 to 10 p.m., the Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (212) 352-3101 or theatermania.com; $15, or pay what you will for Queens residents.(Roslyn Sulcas)</p>

        <p>DANSCORES BY OFELIA LORET DE MOLA  (Thursday) Although ''Aktun Spukil'' sounds like one of the crew on the Starship Enterprise, it is, according to Mexican lore, the name of a group of caves in which the Maya took shelter during battles. The work by the choreographer Ofelia Loret de Mola is the only dance offering in the Celebrate Mexico Now festival. . At 8 p.m. Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 431-9233; $15, students $12.

Battery Park, rivertoriver.com.(Rockwell)</p>
        <p>NOÉMI LAFRANCE (Wednesday and Thursday) Apparently Ms. LaFrance, a tireless artistic explorer of public space, is a glutton for punishment. Having moved bureaucratic mountains last year to stage ''Agora'' in the enormous (and empty) McCarren Park pool in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, she now has a sequel, ''Agora II,'' which incorporates a number of guest companies and is described in the publicity materials as ''a choreographic game for one thousand bodies.'' Good luck to them all. At 8 p.m., McCarren Park Pool, Lorimer Street between Driggs and Bayard Streets, (718) 388-6309 or sensproduction.org; $20 and $30. (Sulcas)</p>

        <p>New Ballet Choreographers (Wednesday) Ashley Bouder, Maria Kowrowski and Wendy Whelan are among the wonderful group of dancers from the New York City Ballet and American Ballet Theater Studio Company who will dance in this enticing program of new ballets to live music by the Masada String Trio. The choreographers are the City Ballet soloists Edwaard Liang and Tom Gold, and the former Ballet Theater dancer Brian Reeder. Mr. Gold is the wild card here -- the other two have budding reputations as promising ballet choreographers -- but he is in very good company.

        <p>PENNSYLVANIA BALLET: TRIBUTE TO BARBARA WEISBERGER (Tomorrow) Not only will the program celebrate the 80th birthday of Ms. Weisberger, founder of the company and a feisty longtime voice for classical ballet in America, but it promises to be a nostalgic look back at the history of this important American troupe and of American ballet itself. The tribute will also raise money for a scholarship fund for young dancers. From 5 to 8 p.m., Philadelphia Art Alliance, 251 South 18th Street, Philadelphia, (215) 551-7000 ext. 1209 or www.paballet.org; $80 and $150. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>ELKE RINDFLEISCH (Thursday) In Ms. Rindfleisch's new ''Damage,'' six dancers will struggle through a spreading inner disturbance to rock music by Chris Woltmann, performed live, through Sept. 16 and from Sept. 21 to 23. They end up nowhere, the choreographer says, or in places of unexpected tenderness in a set that fills the performance space with small alternative spaces. At 8 p.m., Wallabout Studio, 50 Taaffe Place, between Flushing and Park Avenues, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (917) 251-4561 or rindfleischdance.com; $15. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>TEA Dance Company (Thursday) Sahar Javedani and Ella Ben-Aharon, the troupe's resident choreographers, will present their new ''Garden,'' which probes the notion of the pre-apple Eden as a metaphor for the personal acquisition of knowledge. At 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street at Second Avenue, East Village, (212) 674-8194 or www.danspaceproject.org; $20; $15 for students and 65+.(Dunning)</p>
        <p>YUBIWA Hotel (Thursday) In its American debut, this all-female modern dance and performance company will examine the Japanese woman today, focusing on girlhood in ''Candies: girlish hardcore,'' which runs through Sept. 16. At 7:30 p.m., Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 752-3015 or japansociety.org; $28. (Dunning)</p>

        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>* American Folk Art Museum: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY),' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)</p>
        <p>BARD GRADUATE CENTER: ' LIONS, DRAGONS AND OTHER BEASTS: AQUAMANILIA OF THE MIDDLE AGES, VESSELS FOR CHURCH AND TABLE,' through Oct. 15. Aquamanilia sounds like the latest perfume or sorbet, but actually refers to the small, cunningly figurative medieval vessels used for ritual hand washing. Cast in sturdy, glowing copper-alloy, most often in the form of lions with serpents on their backs, aquamanilia are now having their first exhibition, complete with lavish catalog. The show has been drawn mostly from the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and overseen by the head of the museum's medieval department and its object conservator in collaboration with Bard graduate students. But don't worry about dryness. The aquamanile's triple function as totem, prestige object and pitcher lends it an undeniable energy. (The serpents are handles.) The show feels like a walk-in bestiary and is enhanced by striking abbreviations reminiscent of folk art; a versatile repertory of incised details and patterns; and a continuing, rarely resolved struggle between form and function. Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design and Culture, 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000. (Smith)</p>
        <p>COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through Oct. 22. It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedeker's guides, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them and souvenir platters, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining. And Church's oil sketches alone are worth the price of admission: exquisite, plainspoken Emersonian love poems to New York and New England. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400 or ndm.si.edu. (Michael Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>* Dahesh Museum of Art: 'NAPOLEON ON THE NILE: SOLDIERS, ARTISTS AND THE REDISCOVERY OF EGYPT,' through Dec. 31. Napoleon's invasion of Egypt was a military disaster, but the squadron of scholars and scientists that went with him lay the foundation for Egyptology and Egyptomania, gave Orientalism a big boost and was commemorated by the 1,000 engravings of the 23-volume ''Description de l'Égypte.'' Examples of the book's prints form the backbone of this engrossing if somewhat strange and sometimes piecemeal show, which includes Orientalist paintings and a cache of fascinating ephemera. 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 759-0606, daheshmuseum.org. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Dia:Beacon: 'Agnes Martin: A Field of Vision: Paintings from the 1980's,'  through March. Dia:Beacon, a bulwark of Minimalism on the banks of the Hudson River north of Manhattan, has three permanent galleries devoted to the artist Agnes Martin. Over the last two years they have been used for a retrospective of her paintings, installed in decade-long increments. The fourth installment is now in place. If Martin's spare, lucid compositions of drawn lines and painted bands feel different from much of the art around them here, that is because she was not a Minimalist. In fact, she called herself an Abstract Expressionist, and she was adamant on this point. The 18 paintings here confirm her conviction, in a show as deep, light-glinting, restless and purposeful as the river flowing nearby. Dia:Beacon, Riggio Galleries, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100. (Holland Cotter)</p>
        <p>* Frick Collection : 'Jean-Étienne Liotard (1702-1789): Swiss MasteR,' through Sept. 17. Liotard is something of a specialty item now, but he was widely known in the Enlightenment Europe of his day. And even then he was seen as a maverick, a figure of contradictions. He was a stone-cold realist in an age of rococo frills. In a great age of oil painting, he favored pastel. He had ultrafancy sitters for his portraits, including Marie Antoinette. But his most vivid likenesses are of himself and his family. The Frick's perfectly proportioned sweetheart of a solo show is the artist's first in North America. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Guild Hall Museum: 'Elizabeth Peyton,'  through Oct. 22. Most of the 43 works in this exhibition portray beautiful people, some famous, some less so. Most immediately engaging is the tension between the painterly abstraction and the human subject matter. Images are realized in drippy swatches, squiggly lines and feathery dabs, and colors range from incandescent reds and oranges to pale lavenders and grays to dark velvety browns, blacks and purples. Yet for all that expressionistic action, likenesses are exacting. People like Nicole Kidman and Queen Elizabeth are rendered with seemingly effortless precision. A kind of erotic yearning animates how Ms. Peyton sees her subjects and how she makes her pictures. To paint, her works imply, is to be in love: to be in love with certain people and with painting itself. 158 Main Street, East Hampton, N.Y., (631) 324-0806. (Ken Johnson)</p>
        <p>SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Guggenheim's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery. (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Nicolai Ouroussoff)</p>
        <p>Katonah Museum of Art: 'Andromeda Hotel, the Art of Joseph Cornell,'  through Sept. 17. Although Cornell never left the United States, he translated his dreams of faraway places into delicate, sometimes overly precious works that have a sense of longing. In this show the white-painted, weathered interior of a box titled ''Grand Hotel -- Hotel Taglioni'' (1954) contains incongruous elements of collage, among them an old ad for a French bakery topped by a color cutout of the ballerina Marie Taglioni, an object of the artist's adoration. Even simpler, but equally dreamy, is another weathered box, ''Hotel de l'Étoile'' (1950), which holds only a long, vertical image of a deep blue sky rife with thousands of tiny pinpoints of light. One of the show's most striking images is a surreal photograph of Cornell by Lee Miller in which he is seen gazing upward, entranced, his shoulder adorned with a miniature sailboat (around 1935). Route 22 at Jay Street, Katonah, N.Y., (914) 232-9555, katonahmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck)</p>
        <p>Morgan Library &amp; Museum: CELEBRATING REMBRANDT: ETCHINGS FROM THE MORGAN, through Oct. 1. On the occasion of the opening of its newly rethought home, the Morgan Library has mounted a show of 50 of its greatest Rembrandt etchings. The selection demonstrates the range of the master's subjects (from the heights of biblical tragedy to the casually erotic) and also his amazingly expressive technique. It serves as reminder that Rembrandt's prints represent genius of the plainest, most accessible sort: sustaining classics that encompass the earthy and the exalted and offer fresh meanings with each encounter. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, www.themorgan.org. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* MUseum of modern art: 'ARTIST'S CHOICE: Herzog &amp; DE MEURON, PERCEPTION RESTRAINED,' through Sept. 25. In an unusually accessible bit of institutional critique, the architects who failed to win the commission to design the new Museum of Modern Art bite the hand that didn't feed them. They create a kind of deprivation chamber with a black gallery, where excerpts from American movies play on video screens on the ceiling and 110 works of art and design are crammed into enormous niches that are all but sealed from view. Perverse and cerebral, it may be the best one-liner you'll encounter this summer, and it makes some interesting points about the spectacle of the museum, the Modern included. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)</p>
        <p>NEUE Galerie: Gustav Klimt: Five Paintings From the Collection of Ferdinand and Adele Bloch-Bauer,  through Sept. 18. Klimt's 1907 gold portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, lately acquired by the billionaire collector Ronald S. Lauder, reportedly for $135 million, is now aptly installed like a trophy head above the mantelpiece. She's half queen, half Las Vegas showgirl. A perfect New Yorker. She temporarily hangs with four other Klimts, including a second Adele, painted in 1912: a slender, sinuous Coke-bottle-shaped figure, more chaste than carnal. A painting of a birch forest is an archetypal Klimt mix of uncanny naturalism and geometric abstraction. Two other landscapes, of an apple tree and an unfinished jigsaw-puzzle view of houses on the shore of the Attersee, raise the question: Had Klimt not died at 55 in 1918, would he have ended up a pure abstractionist like Mondrian? 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>* New-York Historical Society: Legacies: Contemporary Artists Reflect on Slavery, through Jan. 7. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the 1960's. That was a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show, the second of three exhibitions on American slavery organized by the New-York Historical Society, 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Wadsworth Atheneum: 'American Splendor: Hudson RiverSchool Masterworks From the Wadsworth Atheneum,' through Dec. 31. Back from a two-and-a-half-year tour at six other American museums, the Wadsworth's formidable collection of 19th-century Hudson River School paintings is on display in this homecoming show. Not every Hudson River collection can boast 11 works by Frederic Edwin Church, 13 by Thomas Cole and 5 by Albert Bierstadt,, a leading painter of the American West, along with powerful examples by other artists of the school. They are among the more than 60 paintings on display here. It's rare that you see these ultrafamiliar paintings in such concentration; their combined presence gives the show a synergistic sparkle and energy that you don't get when you see them in smaller groupings. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, www.wadsworthatheneum.org. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Uptown</p>
        <p>* Sarah Sze: 'Corner Plot' The upper corner of an apartment building protrudes from the Doris C. Freedman Plaza's pavement as if the whole edifice had toppled and sunk into the ground. Through the window's of Ms. Sze's magical outdoor sculpture you can see a complicated interior that looks as if it were created by a mad architect. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>* GALERIE DANIEL BUCHHOLZ AT METRO PICTURES This well-known Cologne gallery presents a surprisingly sweeping view of current art that includes Americans and Europeans and, despite its Conceptual slant, an impressive range of mediums and sensibilities. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, (212) 206-7100, metropicturesgallery.com, through Sept. 16. (Smith)</p>
        <p>HANS RICHTER (1888-1976), DADA; ART AND ANTI-ART This daunting yet partial survey is clogged with late paintings and reliefs that are for the most part elegant pastiches of Constructivism, Cubism and Abstract Expressionism. But it should be seen for the four short films from the 1920's, in which Richter's formalist and Dada sides balance beautifully, with elegantly Surrealist results. This is especially the case in the luminous ''Ghosts Before Breakfast,'' from 1927, which explores most of film's structural possibilities and segues briskly between abstraction and Hollywood narrative, while three skittering bowler hats provide continuity. Maya Stendhal Gallery, 545 West 20th Street, (212) 366-1549, mayastendhalgallery.com, through Sept. 16. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Other Galleries</p>
        <p>'Zoo Story' A clay gorilla by Daisy Youngblood, a bronze she-wolf by Kiki Smith, a flock of concrete sheep by Françoise-Xavier Lalanne and works about animals by more than 20 other artists, including John Baldessari, Katharina Fritsch, Ross Bleckner and Rebecca Horn, turn the first floor of this sleek, three-story private museum into a diverting menagerie. Fisher Landau Center for Art, 38-27 30th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-0727, flcart.org through Oct. 16. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>* Met: 'Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings' This exhibition gets a huge gold A for truth in advertising. The treasures are plentiful, rare and splendid. Much of the work has never traveled before; many objects have only recently come to light in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. They add up to an exhibition as a think-piece essay on how a culture saw itself in the world. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes on Sunday.(Cotter)</p>
        <p>* Morgan Library and Museum: 'Masterworks from the Morgan'  Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's splendid four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels, medieval objects made with so much silver and gold that they seem to give off heat. What's not new: almost everything in this exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts, as well as illuminated gospels, devotional sculptures and historical and literary autograph manuscripts from the Brontës to Bob Dylan. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or www.themorgan.org; closes on Sunday. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'DADA' This is pretty much Dada's official survey (an oxymoron), and it makes nearly all 450 or so objects in it look elegant. That hat rack looks awfully stylish now. It's good to be reacquainted with a generation of artists who had no market to speak of and for whom society's corruption and exhaustion seemed golden opportunities to make themselves useful. Cynical and traumatized, the Dadaists were tireless young optimists at heart. They discovered a world full of wonders, and we are, on the whole, their beneficiaries. (212) 708-9400, moma.org; closes on Monday. (Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>* JAMES J. WILLIAMS III: 'BY REQUEST, MY EPITAPH' Despite debts to artists like Jack Pierson, Karen Kilimnik, Richard Prince and Nan Goldin, this Haversham-ish environment and solo debut exude a promising fusion of modesty and narcissism. Its deep teal walls display scores of Polaroids, drawings, collages, notebooks and thrift-shop-worthy paintings, along with many of the artist's well-worn belongings. An illusion of stylish, if impoverished, full disclosure results. Self-conscious bohemianism teeters between nostalgia and irony, and art emerges as an incessant if nonchalant activity at the center of an eked-out existence. Envoy, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-7524, envoygallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)</p>

Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983, impactfestival.org.</p>
        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, best play and best direction of a play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE WEDDING SINGER'  An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Constantine Maroulis, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'GARDEL: THE MUSICAL' A standard-issue bio-musical about the tango legend Carlos Gardel that wallows in melodrama (1:30). Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, (212) 225-9920. (Jason Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'NO CHILD'  Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates)</p>
        <p>* 'SEVEN GUITARS' (2:45). Life and death dance cheek to cheek in this fine new revival of August Wilson's drama from 1996. Directed by Ruben Santiago-Hudson, and acted with absorbing restraint and immediacy, this is a truly life-size production, which means it is big indeed (2:45). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'SHOUT!' A miniskirted, go-go-booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the showroom of a Carnival cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)</p>
        <p>* '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>Spectacles</p>
        <p>'ABSINTHE' Think Cirque du Soleil as channeled through ''Rocky Horror'' and painted by George Grosz. Part cabaret, part circus, ''Absinthe'' aims for a kind of seedy decadence that's mingled with the simple, aw-shucks wonder of knife-jugglers, sword-swallowers and a man creating constructions out of soap bubbles. It's the main event at the Spiegeltent, a vintage European tradition visiting South Street Seaport this summer (1:30). Spiegeltent, at the former Fulton Fish Market site, Pier 17, South Street, under the Brooklyn Bridge, (212) 279-4200. (Anne Midgette)</p>
        <p>'REVEREND BILLY AND THE CHURCH OF STOP-SHOPPING' Reverend Billy (a k a the performance artist Bill Talen) struts and preaches his way across the Spiegeltent stage accompanied by a choir and a fine seven-piece band. Radical political theater has rarely been more thoughtful or fun (1:30). Spiegeltent, at the former Fulton Fish Market site, Pier 17, South Street, under the Brooklyn Bridge, (212) 279-4200. (George Hunka)</p>
        <p>Long-Running Shows</p>
        <p>* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>

        <p>'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). 2005 New World Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)</p>
        <p>'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)</p>
        <p>'SPAMALOT'  A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans. (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>'CREATION: A CLOWN SHOW' Lucas Caleb Rooney is a cross between Red Skelton and Will Ferrell in this sweet, funny, poignant, mostly one-man show about the biblical story of earth's first seven days (1:15). Theater Five, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444; closing on Sunday. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'HENRIK IBSEN + JON FOSSE: NORWAY MEETS NEW YORK' Ibsen's late-19th-century ''Rosmersholm'' and Fosse's contemporary ''deathvariations'' both deal with suicide, among other life dramas. The Ibsen has problems, but the Fosse is often stunning and fiercely poetic (2:00 and 1:15). At the 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Gates)</p>
        <p>* 'KIKI AND HERB: ALIVE ON BROADWAY' This transcendental lounge act -- made up of Kiki (Justin Bond), a molting songbird for all seasons, and Herb (Kenny Mellman), her happily suffering shadow and accompanist -- has the heat and dazzle of great balls of fire. Vital, funny and surprisingly affecting (2:00). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MR. DOOLEY'S AMERICA' Martin J. Dooley, the wisest fictional pub owner in 1890's Chicago, brings his old newspaper columns back to life with funny, surprisingly timely issues-of-the-day commentary in this likable two-man play (1:40). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737; closing on Sunday. (Gates)</p>

        <p>'ACCEPTED' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A clever slacker and his oddball crew invent a phony college in this passable example of that oxymoronic genre, the Hollywood comedy about sticking it to the man. (Nathan Lee)</p>
        <p>'THE ANT BULLY' (PG, 90 minutes) A young boy goes to live among the ants, who talk remarkably like Academy Award-winning actors. (A. O. Scott)</p>
        <p>'BARNYARD' (PG, 88 minutes) The barnyard animals in this crude 3-D animation walk, talk and party down like human beings. Way too often the male ''cows,'' as the film calls them, also flash their udders. (Manohla Dargis)</p>
        <p>'BEERFEST' (R, 110 minutes) In ''Beerfest,'' a gaseous celebration of binge drinking and family honor, the five comedians known collectively as Broken Lizard head for Munich and an underground beer-guzzling contest. Best viewed while sloshed, the movie is idiotic, tasteless and irrepressibly good-natured: in other words, a frat-house classic. (Jeannette Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'BOYNTON BEACH CLUB' (No rating, 104 minutes) A fast-paced romantic comedy about frisky 60-something residents of a Florida ''active adult'' community, ''Boynton Beach Club'' is a rose-colored fantasy about aging that has just enough credibility to make you care about its characters and wish them merrily on their way. (Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>'CARS' (G, 114 minutes) The latest 3-D toon from Pixar just putt-putt-putts along, a shining model of technological progress and consumer safety. John Lasseter directed, and Owen Wilson provides the voice of the little red race car who learns all the right lessons from, among others, a 1951 Hudson Hornet given voice by Paul Newman. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'The Celestine Prophecy' (PG, 100 minutes) A delectable fusion of New Age babble and luridly bad filmmaking based on the best-selling book by James Redfield. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'CLICK' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Adam Sandler stars in this unfunny comedy about a harried family man who uses a universal remote to hop-scotch through time. It's a wonderful life, not. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER WOMEN' (No rating, 84 minutes) Two old flames meet, years after parting, and have a short fling. An arch, banal conceit, of some interest for Aaron Eckhart and Helena Bonham Carter's performances and the split-screen gimmick that keeps them apart even in their intimate moments. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'CRANK' (R, 83 minutes) A poisoned hit man rampages in Los Angeles, doling revenge on his nemesis and misanthropy on all. Basically a broken-down retread of ''Speed,'' with Jason Stratham as the bus. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'CROSSOVER' (PG-13, 95 minutes) Bling is bad, and friends are good in this story of temptation, rivalry and cheerleaders, set in the world of Detroit street basketball. (Lee)</p>
        <p>* 'THE DESCENT' (R, 99 minutes) A total horror freakout from the British writer and director Neil Marshall about six women on a caving expedition who meet their fears and some scary monsters, too. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA' (PG-13, 106 minutes) Lauren Weisberger's score-settling best seller about a terrible (and famous) boss is reimagined and reversed. Anne Hathaway plays the beleaguered assistant, but she is much less interesting -- and in the end less sympathetic -- than the boss, Miranda Priestly, incarnated by Meryl Streep as a subtle and searching (and very funny) portrait of glamour and power. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'FACTOTUM' (R, 94 minutes) Matt Dillon goes deep to play Henry Chinaski, the familiar alter ego of the great Charles Bukowski, who survived countless benders, brawls, rejection slips, crazy women and soul-killing jobs. The Norwegian filmmaker Bent Hamer directed. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'Gabrielle' (No rating, 90 minutes) A film of eccentric beauty and wild feeling, directed by the consistently inventive Patrice Chéreau and starring the supremely well-matched Pascal Greggory and Isabelle Huppert, about the dissolution of a haut-bourgeois Parisian marriage, around 1912. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'Half Nelson' (R, 107 minutes) In their beautiful bummer about the relationship between a white teacher (Ryan Gosling) and a black student (Shareeka Epps), the gifted young director Ryan Fleck and his writing partner, Anna Boden, offer a lament for the radical fires of the 1960's and a suggestion for life and politics after the new left. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'HEADING SOUTH' (No rating, 105 minutes, in English and French) Sex tourism involving middle-aged white women and black beach boys at a Haitian resort in the late 1970's is the subject of Laurent Cantet's third film, one of the most truthful explorations of desire, age and youth ever filmed, with a politically charged subtext about capitalist imperialism. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'HOW TO EAT FRIED WORMS' (PG, 98 minutes) The worms go in, the worms go out, but mostly the worms go into the frying pan in Bob Dolman's engaging and yucky adaptation of the Thomas Rockwell book. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'HOUSE OF SAND' (R, 115 minutes, in Portuguese) Beautifully shot in a sandy, remote corner of northern Brazil, this film tells the story of three generations of women, all of them played by Fernanda Montenegro and Fernanda Torres, mother and daughter in real life and two of the national treasures of Brazilian cinema. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'IDLEWILD' (R, 120 minutes) André Benjamin and Antwan A. Patton, a k a André 3000 and Big Boi of OutKast, play friends living and sometimes singing in Depression-era Georgia. The joint doesn't jump; it twitches and stumbles. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'THE ILLUSIONIST' (PG-13, 109 minutes) This film tells the story of Eisenheim (Edward Norton), a fictional conjurer who enraptured Viennese audiences in 1900 with his supernatural magic shows. A terrific yarn, it rouses your slumbering belief in the miraculous. (Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'INVINCIBLE' (PG, 99 minutes) The latest addition to the Disney stable of sports-underdog movies, ''Invincible'' is the true story of Vince Papale (Mark Wahlberg), a substitute teacher and part-time bartender, who in 1976 realizes his dream of playing for the Philadelphia Eagles. While Disney piles on the uplift, the director and cinematographer, Ericson Core, counters the story's predictably inspirational trajectory with close attention to historical detail and blue-collar hardship. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'LASSIE' (PG, 100 minutes) Everything old is new again in the 11th film about the beloved pooch with the I.Q. of a grad student and the instincts of a boomerang. Blissfully restored to the period and location of Eric Knight's original novel -- pre-World War Britain -- the movie balances humor and pathos with old-fashioned charm and not a trace of satire. Progressive adults may balk at the film's ultimate capitulation to the power of patronage, but tykes will just be happy that Lassie has come home once more to the multiplex where she belongs. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'LADY IN THE WATER' (PG-13, 108 minutes) In this watchable folly, Paul Giamatti plays a building manager who encounters a menagerie of otherworldly creatures, most important Bryce Dallas Howard's water nymph. The writer and director M. Night Shyamalan wants us to believe, mostly in the myth of his own genius. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'LITTLE MAN' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A belligerent midget jewel thief assaults groins and molests women in this infantile comedy from the Wayans brothers. (Lee)</p>
        <p>* 'Little Miss Sunshine' (R, 101 minutes) A bittersweet comedy of dysfunction that takes place at the terminus of the American dream. The excellent cast includes Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano and that national treasure, Alan Arkin. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'MATERIAL GIRLS' (PG, 97 minutes) The real-life sisters Hilary and Haylie Duff star in this incompetent spin on the poor-little-rich-girl story from, alas, Martha Coolidge. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'MIAMI VICE' (R, 133 minutes) This updating of the 1980's television series cost more than the annual budget of the real-life Miami Police Department, making it the most expensive experimental art film ever made. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'MONSTER HOUSE' (PG, 86 minutes) This scary movie for kids provides more fun in 86 minutes than all the other would-be summer blockbusters combined. Three intrepid youngsters face down a demonic dwelling in a quiet suburb. The motion-capture animation produces an uncanny feeling of realism, while the fantastical effects are spooky, witty and spectacular. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' (PG-13, 151 minutes) Although there are memorable bits and pieces, this is a movie with no particular interest in coherence, economy or feeling. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'PRINCESAS' (No rating, 109 minutes, in Spanish) This maudlin melodrama about prostitutes in Madrid is not, alas, the new film by Pedro Almodóvar, but a dilution of his manner by the writer-director Fernando León de Aranoa. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'Pulse' (PG-13, 87 minutes) Evil technology menaces idiotic teenagers in this cynical remake of a Japanese horror film. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'QUEENS' (No rating, 107 minutes, in Spanish) A dithering but generous Spanish farce, ''Queens'' follows the forthcoming nuptials of three gay couples by focusing on their overbearing mothers. While the sons dance, bicker and fret over antiques, the mamas express their discomfort with the wedding plans by seducing inappropriate men. Despite obvious nods to Pedro Almodóvar, ''Queens'' is notable only for its unadulterated worship of middle-aged women. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'THE QUIET' (R, 96 minutes) Neither ambitious enough to take seriously nor sleazy enough to enjoy, Jamie Babbit's good-girl, bad-girl face-off flirts with the trappings of exploitation cinema without going all the way. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'QUINCEAÑERA' (R, 90 minutes) This portrait of a Mexican-American family living in a Latino neighborhood of Los Angeles is as smart and warm-hearted an exploration of an upwardly mobile immigrant culture as American independent cinema has produced. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'RIDING ALONE FOR THOUSANDS OF MILES' (PG, 108 minutes, in Mandarin) Zhang Yimou takes a pause between marital-arts extravaganzas with this simple, affecting melodrama about a mournful Japanese patriarch on an odyssey through rural China. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'A SCANNER DARKLY' (R, 100 minutes) Identities shift and melt like shadows in Richard Linklater's animated adaptation of the Philip K. Dick semispeculative novel ''A Scanner Darkly,'' a look at a future that appears an awful lot like today. With the voices and gestures of Keanu Reeves, Woody Harrelson, Winona Ryder and a wonderful Robert Downey Jr. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'Scoop' (PG-13, 96 minutes) A not especially funny yet oddly appealing comedy in which Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson make like Nick and Nora, but with more shtick and no martinis (or Asta). (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'SNAKES ON A PLANE' (R, 105 minutes) Snakes + plane + Samuel L. Jackson. David R. Ellis provides the fine B-movie-style direction, while Mr. Jackson supplies the cool and his trademark 13-letter epithet. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'STEP UP' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Ever since Kevin Bacon's rebellious hips ignited a small-town uproar in ''Footloose,'' the modern high school romance has placed a premium on rhythm. In ''Step Up'' a rough Baltimore kid (Channing Tatum), armed only with a killer smile and hip-hop moves, falls for a classically trained dancer (Jenna Dewan). Bland but likable, the movie fashions social equality from big musical numbers. If ballet and hip-hop can coexist, it asks, why can't we all be friends? (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'STRANGERS WITH CANDY' (R, 87 minutes) High school high jinks, adapted from the beloved Comedy Central series. The comedy is stretched a little thin by the feature length, but there are still some laughs. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'MY SUPER EX-GIRLFRIEND' (PG-13, 110 minutes) A shaky comedy from the director Ivan Reitman, in which ''Fatal Attraction'' meets ''Wonder Woman,'' by way of Uma Thurman, Luke Wilson and some sexist she-devil clichés, some funny, others not. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'SUPERMAN RETURNS' (PG-13, 157 minutes) Last seen larking about on the big screen in the 1987 dud ''Superman IV,'' the Man of Steel has been resurrected in Bryan Singer's leaden new film not only to fight for truth, justice and the American way, but also to give Mel Gibson's passion a run for his box-office money. Where once the superhero flew up, up and away, he now flies down, down, down, sent from above to save mankind from its sins and another bummer summer. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'TALLADEGA NIGHTS: THE BALLAD OF RICKY BOBBY' (PG-13, 110 minutes) Fast, fun and silly, with Will Ferrell as a Nascar driver, Sacha Baron Cohen as his nemesis, and a new course record for product placements per gallon. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'13 Tzameti'  (No rating, 90 minutes) The flashy black-and-white directorial debut of the Georgian filmmaker Gela Babluani is a sadistic, arty thriller that suggests a French New Wave film infected by a virulent strain of Eastern European nihilism. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'TRUST THE MAN' (R, 101 minutes) A strained, flatulent relationship comedy about two couples, from the writer and director Bart Freundlich. With Julianne Moore, David Duchovny, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Billy Crudup. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'ANDY WARHOL: A DOCUMENTARY FILM' (No rating, 4 hours with an intermission) Ric Burns's absorbing four-hour critical biography of this seminal Pop artist is devoted to the proposition that Warhol was the greatest artist of the second half of the 20th century, as Picasso was in the first. It makes a mostly persuasive, highly entertaining case for that claim. (Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'WORLD TRADE CENTER' (PG-13, 129 minutes) From Oliver Stone, a return to the emotions of 9/11. Powerful and almost unbearably moving. (Scott)</p>
        <p>Film Series</p>

(Gates)</p>
        <p>THE SUPPORTING CAST: AS BRIGHT AS THE STARS (Through Sept. 26) Symphony Space's series of double features honoring the names well below the title continues on Sunday and Tuesday. The noirish ''Leave Her to Heaven'' (1945), whose supporting actors include Jeanne Crain and Vincent Price, will be shown with ''Written on the Wind'' (1956), for which Dorothy Malone, as a self-destructive rich girl, won the best-supporting-actress Oscar. 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $10.

        <p>BAND OF HORSES (Sunday and Monday) With shimmering guitars that build from teardrops to epic heights and wraithlike, death-obsessed vocals (''At every occasion I'll be ready for the funeral''), this Seattle band's songs both soar and sulk. At 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $17 in advance, $18 at the door. (Ben Sisario)</p>
        <p>BEAUSOLEIL (Monday) Michael Doucet's band, Beausoleil, is the Cajun revival incarnate, determined both to preserve and extend bayou traditions. Mr. Doucet learned the scratch and drone of his fiddle style from the masters of Cajun and Creole music, and he's equally at home playing an old-fashioned two-step or rowdy swamp rock. At 7:30 p.m., with a free dance lesson at 6:30, Connolly's, 121 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-7597, letszydeco.com; $25. (Jon Pareles)</p>

        <p>BORIS; PEARLS AND BRASS (Monday and Tuesday) And on a certain beer-buzzed day (whose ordinal number is forgotten), Deep Purple, the James Gang and Black Sabbath created fuzzy, head-nodding biker metal, and it was good. Many begats later, Pearls and Brass, a trio from Nazareth, Pa., is worshiping studiously at their altar, while Boris, a three-piece from Japan, warps and refracts the same influences in ways that can amplify their power or just make them really noisy and repetitious. Monday at 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; Tuesday at 9 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $12 in advance, $14 at the door.

        <p>BRAZILIAN GIRLS (Thursday) Electronica, a live rhythm section and a wildly cosmopolitan spirit meet a charismatic and unpredictable singer, Sabina Sciubba, in the Brazilian Girls.

At 10 p.m., Spiegeltent, Fulton Fish Market, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, spiegelworld.com; $30. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>BROOKLYN COUNTRY MUSIC FESTIVAL (Tomorrow) Though it may be stretching things a bit to call a one-night club gig a festival, this third annual event has a strong lineup of local honky-tonkers, among them Greg Garing, a stalwart of the New York country scene; the Demolition String Band, from Hoboken, N.J., which does a bluegrass version of Madonna's ''Like a Prayer''; and the Defibulators, who also know how to pick with a wink in songs like ''Armageddon Boogie.'' Others on the bill include Uncle Leon and the Alibis, the Wissler Family, Sweet William, Alex Battles's Whisky Rebellion, Kara Suzanne and the Gojo Hearts and the Lonesome Prairie Dogs. Beginning at 4 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, (718) 230-0236, brooklyncountrymusic.com or spsounds.com; $10. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* CAT POWER AND THE MEMPHIS RHYTHM BAND (Sunday) For her most recent album, ''The Greatest'' (Matador), Chan Marshall, the superbly rueful singer known as Cat Power, recorded in Memphis with a group of veteran soul players. The strutting rhythms, tender guitars and happy horns give her an expressive new vocabulary of sorrows, loves and joys; she hasn't sounded so inspired in years. At 6:30 and 10:30 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $27.50 in advance, $30 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>GEORGE CLINTON AND THE P-FUNK ALL-STARS (Sunday) George Clinton's long-running band has become an American institution, using funk to subvert and outflank any Puritan reflexes. As P-Funk's leisurely jams amble from bubbling-mud funk to slow-grinding blues-rock to bits of doo-wop, jazz and hip-hop, the music is tight and loose at the same time. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $37.50 in advance, $42 at the door. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>COMETS ON FIRE (Tonight) Serving as a reminder that psychedelic rock was as much about testosterone-flooded blues jams as about tangerine trees and marmalade skies, Comets on Fire, from Santa Cruz, Calif., reaches back to the loud legacy of Blue Cheer. With Soldiers of Fortune and Blues Control. At 11, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $14. (Sisario)</p>

(Sisario)</p>
        <p>DEVOTCHKA (Tonight and tomorrow night) DeVotchKa, from Denver, is the most musically versatile band of the Gypsy-punk trendlet of the last few years. It does its share of wild fiddling and rug-cutting, but also plays moody, carefully textured ballads that can recall the Tindersticks. At midnight, Spiegeltent, Fulton Fish Market, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, spiegelworld.com; $20. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* DR. OCTAGON, MR. LIF, BEANS (Tomorrow and Sunday) Kool Keith was already one of the most eccentric figures in rap when he unveiled his Dr. Octagon project a decade ago. But with one brilliantly bizarre album he instantly trumped all as the most clever and twisted mind in the game, his non sequiturs revealing both raunchiness and a kind of innocence. Kool Keith recently released ''The Return of Dr. Octagon'' (OCD); it's no classic, but a good excuse for him to revisit the character. Also on the bill are two of underground rap's best: Mr. Lif, a politically minded M.C. from Boston, and Beans, formerly of New York's Antipop Consortium. Tomorrow at 9 p.m., Sunday at 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $22 in advance, $24 at the door. (Sisario)</p>

Also on the bill is Two Gallants. At 4 p.m., Lorimer Street, between Driggs Avenue and Bayard Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (212) 307-7171; $38.50 in advance, $45 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>PAUL GREEN SCHOOL OF ROCK MUSIC (Today and tomorrow) As seen in the documentary ''Rock School,'' Mr. Green offers an extensive rock curriculum at his school in Philadelphia, teaching youngsters the fundamentals of power chords and budda-budda bass lines. The students have made frequent visits to CBGB, and today and tomorrow afternoon show off their mastery of the works of Van Halen. 5 p.m., 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052, cbgb.com; $10.

(Sisario)</p>
        <p>* MASTODON (Tonight) Until Mastodon released ''Leviathan'' two years ago, the world lacked an extreme metal album based on Melville's ''Moby-Dick''; thankfully, it's an extraordinary piece of work, dense and exhilarating and fully attentive to every slashing sonic detail, as is the band's new album, ''Blood Mountain'' (Warner Brothers), to be released on Tuesday. With Converge, from Salem, Mass., and the Bronx, from Los Angeles. At 6, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $17. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>ASHA PUTHLI (Wednesday) A trailblazing Indian singer who has performed with everybody from Ornette Coleman to Ashford and Simpson, Ms. Puthli makes a rare appearance: this summer she played New York for the first time in 25 years in an abbreviated set at Central Park SummerStage. At 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com; $15 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>RADIO BIRDMAN (Tonight) In the mid-70's, Radio Birdman kick-started the Australian punk scene with a brawny, speedy style drawn from Detroit groups like the MC5 and the Stooges. (Not a coincidence: one of Radio Birdman's guitarists, Deniz Tek, grew up in Ann Arbor, Mich.) Thirty years after its first record, the band makes its New York debut. With the Rogers Sisters and Easy Action. At 9, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $25. (Sisario)</p>

With Jason Collett. At 8 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; $15. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>SHAKIRA, WYCLEF JEAN (Tonight) Their flirty duet ''Hips Don't Lie'' was one of the biggest hits of the summer, perhaps because its odd stabs at political commentary (''Why the C.I.A. wanna watch us?/ Colombians and Haitians/ I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction,'' Mr. Jean raps) are no match for its old-fashioned, steamy body language (''I'm on tonight/ My hips don't lie/ And I am starting to feel you, boy,'' Shakira replies). At 8, Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $19.50 to $129.50. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>MARTA TOPFEROVA (Tuesday) A Czech singer whose heart is in Latin American music, Ms. Topferova dips into styles from across the Caribbean and South America -- Cuban son, Venezuelan joropo, Puerto Rican bomba -- plays the small Caribbean guitar called a cuatro and sings with an elegant longing in her voice. At 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com; $15. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>* M. WARD, OAKLEY HALL (Thursday) On his mesmerizing new album, ''Post-War'' (Merge), M. Ward mingles political indignation, however oblique (''He was a good man and now he's gone,'' goes ''Requiem,'' about a fallen soldier), with a languid, surrealistic melancholy. Oakley Hall, from Brooklyn, mutates patient country-folk into dense, psychedelic drones. At 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $20. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>ROGER WATERS (Tuesday and Wednesday) It's been two months since the death of Syd Barrett, Pink Floyd's first leader and an inventor of psychedelic rock, as well as one of the most famous casualties of its lifestyle. Now Mr. Waters, billing himself as ''the creative genius of Pink Floyd,'' is touring with a live version of ''The Dark Side of the Moon,'' the band's epochal 1973 concept album about insanity. At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; sold out. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>THE WHO (Wednesday) Down to just Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey (with hired guns), the Who has made an ambitious play by recording its first new album in 24 years, to be released next month. But the real surprise is just how good it is; based on ''Wire &amp; Glass,'' the teaser EP released in Britain this summer, it is a throwback to the expansive, rock-opera brilliance of ''Quadrophenia.'' With Peeping Tom. At 8 p.m., Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000, nikonjonesbeach.com; $58.50 to $258.50. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>WIDESPREAD PANIC (Thursday) Widespread Panic, from Georgia, leans toward the Southern-rock side of the Allman Brothers-Grateful Dead axis, but like any good jam band, it's flexible and then some. At 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $50. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>WORLD PARTY (Tomorrow) For a few albums as World Party in the 1980's and 90's, Karl Wallinger borrowed worshipfully and unapologetically from the holy texts of 60's rock -- Beatles, Stones, Dylan, Beach Boys -- prefiguring the now-omnipresent retro-rock trend. He recently returned after a long recovery from a debilitating aneurysm, and has rejiggered his last album, ''Dumbing Up'' (Seaview), for rerelease. With Gina Villalobos. At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $30 in advance, $35 at the door. (Sisario)</p>

        <p>THE BAD PLUS/JASON MORAN AND THE BANDWAGON (Tuesday through Thursday) Two trios, both plumbing the territory between melodic abstraction and gut-level groove, both featuring an erudite pianist and both involving a turbulent and unconventional drummer.

        <p>TONY MALABY TUBA TRIO (Wednesday) Tony Malaby, a versatile and increasingly prominent tenor saxophonist, convenes an exploratory trio with Marcus Rojas on tuba and John Hollenbeck on drums and percussion; the name of the trio is appropriate, given the central role that Mr. Rojas assumes.

You suspect that the name being applied to the trio here wasn't Mr. Scofield's idea -- would he describe his funkier projects as ''fake jazz''? -- but in any case, the music will be jazz, and powerfully real. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>* SOUND OF THE SORCERER: THE MUSIC OF HERMETO PASCOAL (Tomorrow) The influence of the visionary Brazilian composer Hermeto Pascoal has traveled far and wide, and this evening it will animate two different ensembles. The first is a chamber group led by the Brazilian pianist and flutist Jovino Santos Neto, featuring Paquito D'Rivera on clarinet and Mike Marshall on mandolin; the second is a big band led by the percussionist Bobby Sanabria that will give some of Mr. Pascoal's music its United States premiere. At 8:30 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, kaufman-center.org; $35. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>LUCIANA SOUZA: BRAZILIAN DUOS (Wednesday and Thursday) Ms. Souza, a vocalist raised in São Paolo, has made some of her most beguiling music in this format, joined by a lone acoustic guitar. Romero Lubambo, the guitarist, is more than an accompanist: providing intricate counterpoint and rhythmic undertow, he is Ms. Souza's equal. (Through Sept. 17.) At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard , 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $25. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>WILLIAMSBURG JAZZ FESTIVAL (Sunday through Thursday) This grass-roots affair, which briefly floods a small swatch of Brooklyn with modern jazz, kicks off late Sunday night with a no-cover jam session (at Rose, 345 Grand Street, between Havemeyer and Marcy Streets), and continues through next week. One of its highlights is a program featuring bands led by the tenor saxophonist Seamus Blake and the bassist Chris Tarry, among others (Thursday at Galapagos, 70 North Sixth Street). (Through Sept. 16.) Times and locations vary; for a full schedule, visit fullcircledrumming.com/wjazzfestival. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>MIGUEL ZENÓN AND THE RHYTHM COLLECTIVE (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Zenón, a serious-minded young alto saxophonist from Puerto Rico, leads an aptly named ensemble of musicians with a similar cultural heritage: Aldemar Valentin on electric bass, Reynaldo deJesus on hand percussion and Tony Escapa on drums. At 9 and 10:30, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $15; members, $12. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>* JOHN ZORN AND THE BOOK OF ANGELS (Sunday) The Oy!Hoo Festival -- also known as the New York Jewish Music and Heritage Festival -- kicks off with this kaleidoscopic tour through ''The Book of Angels,'' a body of 300 works composed by John Zorn during an apparently feverish three-month span. Mr. Zorn will play alto saxophone in Masada, his original avant-garde klezmer quartet, and with Electric Masada, his eight-piece improvising chamber group. And he will conduct both the Masada String Trio and the Kol Nidre String Orchestra, an ensemble named after the sacred Jewish prayer. At 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, oyhoo.com; $25 to $118. (Chinen)</p>

        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>* 'LA BOHÈME' AND 'CARMEN' (Tonight through Sunday) If promoters and presenters of classical music need proof that the steep cost of tickets discourages people, especially younger ones, from attending, they should stop by Lincoln Center for the New York City Opera's ''Opera-for-All'' programs. This weekend the series, introduced at the beginning of last season, offers the company's productions of Puccini's ''Bohème'' and Bizet's ''Carmen'' priced at $25 a seat, for any seat in the house. Tickets are sold on a first-come-first-served basis. Last year, the company reports, 71 percent of the audiences for ''Opera-for-All'' events had never been to the City Opera before. The productions tend to feature young, eager and attractive singers in stagings that emphasize opera as a vivid form of theater. Rinat Shaham sings the title role in ''Carmen'' (tomorrow night at 8); James Robinson's updated production of ''La Bohème'' features Shu-Ying Li as Mimi and James Valenti in his company debut as Rodolfo (tonight at 8 and Sunday at 1:30 p.m.). New York State Theater, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com. (Anthony Tommasini)</p>
        <p>* 'SEMELE' (Wednesday) In the last 15 years the New York City Opera has become a haven for Handel. This season the company presents the New York stage premiere of ''Semele,'' a work the composer conceived and presented as a dramatic oratorio, though in the 20th century it was effectively staged. The City Opera's new production is by the director Stephen Lawless. The brilliant coloratura soprano Elizabeth Futral sings the title role. The charismatic mezzo-soprano Vivica Genaux, who has performed at the Metropolitan Opera and other major international companies, sings Juno. The impressive cast also includes Constance Hauman and Sanford Sylvan. Anthony Walker conducts. At 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>Classical Music</p>
        <p>BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Monday, and Thursday) The weekend on Brooklyn's favorite floating concert hall begins with the second of two performances by the fine pianists Ursula Oppens and Jerome Lowenthal in an entertaining program of Mozart and variations on Wagner; it continues with a performance by the Shanghai String Quartet: works by Turina and Zhou Long, and string quartets by Barber and Ravel. On Thursday the pianist Maya Hartman gives a solo recital, playing Berger and Griffes, Mozart and Schumann. There is also a special 9/11 memorial concert on Monday (see box). Tonight, tomorrow, Monday and Thursday nights at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 4, Fulton Ferry Landing, next to the Brooklyn Bridge, (718) 624-2083, bargemusic.org; $35; $30 for 65+; $20 for students; Monday's concert is free. (Anne Midgette)</p>
        <p>ANDREA BOCELLI (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Bocelli occupies a small, glamorous and highly profitable space between grand opera and public entertainment. His personality and slight tenor voice have won him a big following, as witnessed by four sold-out concerts at Avery Fisher Hall, the last two of which are tonight and tomorrow night. Asher Fisch conducts the New York Philharmonic in this program of operatic favorites. At 8, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org. (Bernard Holland)</p>
        <p>CONCERTANTE  (Sunday) This young chamber group plays Boccherini's G minor String Quintet and Lowell Lieberman's ''One Plus Five.'' Later Anton Nel is the pianist in Elgar's estimable A minor Quintet. At 3 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, ekcc.org; $20. (Holland)</p>
        <p>ETHEL (Tuesday) Funky and genre-defying, Ethel is the rock band of string quartets -- the term ''classical'' hardly applies to its brand of eclectic, hip music. The ensemble is celebrating the release of its second CD, ''Light'' (Canteloupe Records), with a concert featuring a mix of so-called EthelFaves (top requests from previous concerts) and new music; the CD includes compositions by Don Byron, Pamela Z, Mary Ellen Childs, Marcelo Zarvos, you name it. Audiences may not know exactly what hit them, but they usually like it. At 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com; $15. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>HERMINE HASELBÖCK (Tonight) This young Austrian singer and the pianist Istvan Bonyhadi bring late Romantic and early 20th-century Vienna to the Austrian Cultural Forum's tiny performing space. Songs are by Berg, Schoenberg, Franz Schreker and Zemlinsky. At 8, 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 319-5300, Ext. 222, acfny.org; free, but tickets are required. (Holland)</p>
        <p>JENNY LIN (Tuesday) A smart musician, in the best sense of both words, Ms. Lin is forging a fine career exactly on her own terms, which include a strong commitment to contemporary and less-known music. Her canny program for the Austrian Cultural Forum's ''Mostly Modern'' festival balances Austrian and American composers, modern and contemporary: two 20th-century classics, Barber and Berg; two strong women, Ruth Crawford Seeger and Olga Neuwirth; and two young contemporary composers, Randy Nordschow and Johannes Maria Staud. At 8 p.m., 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 319-5300, Ext. 222, acfny.org; free, but tickets are required. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Wednesday and Thursday) After its preseason programs with the crossover sensation Andrea Bocelli, the Philharmonic under its music director Lorin Maazel opens its formal season on Wednesday. True to tradition, this gala offers familiar fare, Beethoven's ''Egmont'' Overture and ''Eroica'' Symphony. Mozart's joyous Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra in E flat, which does not turn up as often as it might, is the one novelty. The soloists in the concerto will be Emanuel Ax and Yefim Bronfman, who besides being excellent pianists, are also friends and New York neighbors. The music director, Lorin Maazel, conducts. Starting on Thursday night in the first subscription series program of the season, Mr. Maazel and his players offer more intriguing fare, with the American premiere of Hans Werner Henze's ''Sebastian im Traum''; Ravel's sultry ''Rapsodie Espagnole''; Stravinsky's ''Firebird'' Suite; and Bruch's most popular work, the Violin Concerto in G minor, with Itzhak Perlman as soloist. (There are three more performances of Thursday's program through Sept. 19.) At 7:30, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $85 tickets remaining on Wednesday, sold out on Thursday. (Tommasini)</p>

        <p>THE BROOKLYN ADULT RECORDER CHOIR (Thursday) The name of this group turns out to be literal description rather than whimsy: a self-described ''ad-hoc group'' of some 60 performers trying to recapture the joys of those painful recorder lessons at school during ''In the Closet, Again, Again.'' The choreographer Beth Gill and the composer Chris Peck thought this up. From 7 to 10 p.m., the Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (212) 352-3101 or theatermania.com; $15, or pay what you will for Queens residents.(Roslyn Sulcas)</p>
        <p>* DANCENOW/NYC (Tonight though Sunday and Thursday) The 12th season of this varied showcase, at Dance Theater Workshop through tomorrow and at Joe's Pub at the Public Theater from Thursday through next Saturday. Each program offers a plethora of dancers, most of them young and upwardly mobile. The complete schedule is at dancenownyc.org. Tonight at 7:30 ($20); tomorrow at 2 ($15), 5 (free), and 7:30 p.m. ($20), Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077 or dtw.org. Thursday at 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com or joespub.org; $20. (John Rockwell)</p>
        <p>DANSCORES BY OFELIA LORET DE MOLA  (Thursday) Although ''Aktun Spukil'' sounds like one of the crew on the Starship Enterprise, it is, according to Mexican lore, the name of a group of caves in which the Maya took shelter during battles. The work by the choreographer Ofelia Loret de Mola is the only dance offering in the Celebrate Mexico Now festival. . At 8 p.m. Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 431-9233; $15, students $12. (Sulcas)</p>
        <p>* EVENING STARS (Tonight and Sunday) The big late-summer free dance sampler in New York, presented by the River to River Festival with the Joyce Theater and the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, offers a heavy-hitting triple bill tonight of Trisha Brown, Ashleigh Leite and Stephen Petronio, with a salsa chaser on Sunday: an amateur contest at 4 p.m. followed by a professional show at 7:30 that includes the contest winner. Battery Park, rivertoriver.com.(Rockwell)</p>
        <p>NOÉMI LAFRANCE (Wednesday and Thursday) Apparently Ms. LaFrance, a tireless artistic explorer of public space, is a glutton for punishment. Having moved bureaucratic mountains last year to stage ''Agora'' in the enormous (and empty) McCarren Park pool in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, she now has a sequel, ''Agora II,'' which incorporates a number of guest companies and is described in the publicity materials as ''a choreographic game for one thousand bodies.'' Good luck to them all. At 8 p.m., McCarren Park Pool, Lorimer Street between Driggs and Bayard Streets, (718) 388-6309 or sensproduction.org; $20 and $30. (Sulcas)</p>
        <p>LIVE ARTS FESTIVAL AND PHILLY FRINGE (Today through Thursday) Dance and performance art by 16 choreographers and companies will be presented this week in theaters in and around Center City Philadelphia, among them Kate Watson-Wallace; the Jo Stromgren Kompani; BalletX in dances by Jorma Elo and Matthew Neenan; Reggie Wilson; and Jeb Kreager. For information about the festival, which runs through Sept. 16: (215) 413-1318 or livearts-fringe.org; $10, $15 and $20, depending on the event, with some shows free. (Jennifer Dunning)</p>
        <p>JEREMY NELSON (Wednesday and Thursday) Mr. Nelson will continue his investigation into physical turbulence in his new ''Mean Piece,'' a work for six dancers with sets and costumes by Luis Lara Malvacias. (Through Sept. 16.) At 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077 or www.dtw.org; $12. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>New Ballet Choreographers (Wednesday) Ashley Bouder, Maria Kowrowski and Wendy Whelan are among the wonderful group of dancers from the New York City Ballet and American Ballet Theater Studio Company who will dance in this enticing program of new ballets to live music by the Masada String Trio. The choreographers are the City Ballet soloists Edwaard Liang and Tom Gold, and the former Ballet Theater dancer Brian Reeder. Mr. Gold is the wild card here -- the other two have budding reputations as promising ballet choreographers -- but he is in very good company. At 7 p.m., Miller Theater at Columbia University, 116th Street and Broadway, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799; $35, Columbia students $7, non-Columbia students and Guggenheim Museum members, $21. (Sulcas)</p>
        <p>'SUNDAYS @ THREE' : DAGMAR SPAIN AND DANCERS (Sunday) Ms. Spain will present dance vignettes based on poetry sung by the jazz singer Elisabeth Lohninger in this informal performance and talk series. At 3 p.m., 92nd Street Y Harkness Dance Center, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500 or 92Y.org; $10.(Dunning)</p>
        <p>PENNSYLVANIA BALLET: TRIBUTE TO BARBARA WEISBERGER (Tomorrow) Not only will the program celebrate the 80th birthday of Ms. Weisberger, founder of the company and a feisty longtime voice for classical ballet in America, but it promises to be a nostalgic look back at the history of this important American troupe and of American ballet itself. The tribute will also raise money for a scholarship fund for young dancers. From 5 to 8 p.m., Philadelphia Art Alliance, 251 South 18th Street, Philadelphia, (215) 551-7000 ext. 1209 or www.paballet.org; $80 and $150. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>ELKE RINDFLEISCH (Thursday) In Ms. Rindfleisch's new ''Damage,'' six dancers will struggle through a spreading inner disturbance to rock music by Chris Woltmann, performed live, through Sept. 16 and from Sept. 21 to 23. They end up nowhere, the choreographer says, or in places of unexpected tenderness in a set that fills the performance space with small alternative spaces. At 8 p.m., Wallabout Studio, 50 Taaffe Place, between Flushing and Park Avenues, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (917) 251-4561 or rindfleischdance.com; $15. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>TEA Dance Company (Thursday) Sahar Javedani and Ella Ben-Aharon, the troupe's resident choreographers, will present their new ''Garden,'' which probes the notion of the pre-apple Eden as a metaphor for the personal acquisition of knowledge. At 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street at Second Avenue, East Village, (212) 674-8194 or www.danspaceproject.org; $20; $15 for students and 65+.(Dunning)</p>
        <p>YUBIWA Hotel (Thursday) In its American debut, this all-female modern dance and performance company will examine the Japanese woman today, focusing on girlhood in ''Candies: girlish hardcore,'' which runs through Sept. 16. At 7:30 p.m., Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 752-3015 or japansociety.org; $28. (Dunning)</p>

        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>* American Folk Art Museum: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY),' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)</p>
        <p>BARD GRADUATE CENTER: ' LIONS, DRAGONS AND OTHER BEASTS: AQUAMANILIA OF THE MIDDLE AGES, VESSELS FOR CHURCH AND TABLE,' through Oct. 15. Aquamanilia sounds like the latest perfume or sorbet, but actually refers to the small, cunningly figurative medieval vessels used for ritual hand washing. Cast in sturdy, glowing copper-alloy, most often in the form of lions with serpents on their backs, aquamanilia are now having their first exhibition, complete with lavish catalog. The show has been drawn mostly from the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and overseen by the head of the museum's medieval department and its object conservator in collaboration with Bard graduate students. But don't worry about dryness. The aquamanile's triple function as totem, prestige object and pitcher lends it an undeniable energy. (The serpents are handles.) The show feels like a walk-in bestiary and is enhanced by striking abbreviations reminiscent of folk art; a versatile repertory of incised details and patterns; and a continuing, rarely resolved struggle between form and function. Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design and Culture, 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000. (Smith)</p>
        <p>COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through Oct. 22. It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedeker's guides, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them and souvenir platters, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining. And Church's oil sketches alone are worth the price of admission: exquisite, plainspoken Emersonian love poems to New York and New England. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400 or ndm.si.edu. (Michael Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>* Dahesh Museum of Art: 'NAPOLEON ON THE NILE: SOLDIERS, ARTISTS AND THE REDISCOVERY OF EGYPT,' through Dec. 31. Napoleon's invasion of Egypt was a military disaster, but the squadron of scholars and scientists that went with him lay the foundation for Egyptology and Egyptomania, gave Orientalism a big boost and was commemorated by the 1,000 engravings of the 23-volume ''Description de l'Égypte.'' Examples of the book's prints form the backbone of this engrossing if somewhat strange and sometimes piecemeal show, which includes Orientalist paintings and a cache of fascinating ephemera. 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 759-0606, daheshmuseum.org. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Dia:Beacon: 'Agnes Martin: A Field of Vision: Paintings from the 1980's,'  through March. Dia:Beacon, a bulwark of Minimalism on the banks of the Hudson River north of Manhattan, has three permanent galleries devoted to the artist Agnes Martin. Over the last two years they have been used for a retrospective of her paintings, installed in decade-long increments. The fourth installment is now in place. If Martin's spare, lucid compositions of drawn lines and painted bands feel different from much of the art around them here, that is because she was not a Minimalist. In fact, she called herself an Abstract Expressionist, and she was adamant on this point. The 18 paintings here confirm her conviction, in a show as deep, light-glinting, restless and purposeful as the river flowing nearby. Dia:Beacon, Riggio Galleries, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100. (Holland Cotter)</p>
        <p>* Frick Collection : 'Jean-Étienne Liotard (1702-1789): Swiss MasteR,' through Sept. 17. Liotard is something of a specialty item now, but he was widely known in the Enlightenment Europe of his day. And even then he was seen as a maverick, a figure of contradictions. He was a stone-cold realist in an age of rococo frills. In a great age of oil painting, he favored pastel. He had ultrafancy sitters for his portraits, including Marie Antoinette. But his most vivid likenesses are of himself and his family. The Frick's perfectly proportioned sweetheart of a solo show is the artist's first in North America. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Guild Hall Museum: 'Elizabeth Peyton,'  through Oct. 22. Most of the 43 works in this exhibition portray beautiful people, some famous, some less so. Most immediately engaging is the tension between the painterly abstraction and the human subject matter. Images are realized in drippy swatches, squiggly lines and feathery dabs, and colors range from incandescent reds and oranges to pale lavenders and grays to dark velvety browns, blacks and purples. Yet for all that expressionistic action, likenesses are exacting. People like Nicole Kidman and Queen Elizabeth are rendered with seemingly effortless precision. A kind of erotic yearning animates how Ms. Peyton sees her subjects and how she makes her pictures. To paint, her works imply, is to be in love: to be in love with certain people and with painting itself. 158 Main Street, East Hampton, N.Y., (631) 324-0806. (Ken Johnson)</p>
        <p>SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Guggenheim's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery. (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Nicolai Ouroussoff)</p>
        <p>Katonah Museum of Art: 'Andromeda Hotel, the Art of Joseph Cornell,'  through Sept. 17. Although Cornell never left the United States, he translated his dreams of faraway places into delicate, sometimes overly precious works that have a sense of longing. In this show the white-painted, weathered interior of a box titled ''Grand Hotel -- Hotel Taglioni'' (1954) contains incongruous elements of collage, among them an old ad for a French bakery topped by a color cutout of the ballerina Marie Taglioni, an object of the artist's adoration. Even simpler, but equally dreamy, is another weathered box, ''Hotel de l'Étoile'' (1950), which holds only a long, vertical image of a deep blue sky rife with thousands of tiny pinpoints of light. One of the show's most striking images is a surreal photograph of Cornell by Lee Miller in which he is seen gazing upward, entranced, his shoulder adorned with a miniature sailboat (around 1935). Route 22 at Jay Street, Katonah, N.Y., (914) 232-9555, katonahmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck)</p>
        <p>Morgan Library &amp; Museum: CELEBRATING REMBRANDT: ETCHINGS FROM THE MORGAN, through Oct. 1. On the occasion of the opening of its newly rethought home, the Morgan Library has mounted a show of 50 of its greatest Rembrandt etchings. The selection demonstrates the range of the master's subjects (from the heights of biblical tragedy to the casually erotic) and also his amazingly expressive technique. It serves as reminder that Rembrandt's prints represent genius of the plainest, most accessible sort: sustaining classics that encompass the earthy and the exalted and offer fresh meanings with each encounter. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, www.themorgan.org. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* MUseum of modern art: 'ARTIST'S CHOICE: Herzog &amp; DE MEURON, PERCEPTION RESTRAINED,' through Sept. 25. In an unusually accessible bit of institutional critique, the architects who failed to win the commission to design the new Museum of Modern Art bite the hand that didn't feed them. They create a kind of deprivation chamber with a black gallery, where excerpts from American movies play on video screens on the ceiling and 110 works of art and design are crammed into enormous niches that are all but sealed from view. Perverse and cerebral, it may be the best one-liner you'll encounter this summer, and it makes some interesting points about the spectacle of the museum, the Modern included. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)</p>
        <p>NEUE Galerie: Gustav Klimt: Five Paintings From the Collection of Ferdinand and Adele Bloch-Bauer,  through Sept. 18. Klimt's 1907 gold portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, lately acquired by the billionaire collector Ronald S. Lauder, reportedly for $135 million, is now aptly installed like a trophy head above the mantelpiece. She's half queen, half Las Vegas showgirl. A perfect New Yorker. She temporarily hangs with four other Klimts, including a second Adele, painted in 1912: a slender, sinuous Coke-bottle-shaped figure, more chaste than carnal. A painting of a birch forest is an archetypal Klimt mix of uncanny naturalism and geometric abstraction. Two other landscapes, of an apple tree and an unfinished jigsaw-puzzle view of houses on the shore of the Attersee, raise the question: Had Klimt not died at 55 in 1918, would he have ended up a pure abstractionist like Mondrian? 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>* New-York Historical Society: Legacies: Contemporary Artists Reflect on Slavery, through Jan. 7. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the 1960's. That was a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show, the second of three exhibitions on American slavery organized by the New-York Historical Society, 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Wadsworth Atheneum: 'American Splendor: Hudson RiverSchool Masterworks From the Wadsworth Atheneum,' through Dec. 31. Back from a two-and-a-half-year tour at six other American museums, the Wadsworth's formidable collection of 19th-century Hudson River School paintings is on display in this homecoming show. Not every Hudson River collection can boast 11 works by Frederic Edwin Church, 13 by Thomas Cole and 5 by Albert Bierstadt,, a leading painter of the American West, along with powerful examples by other artists of the school. They are among the more than 60 paintings on display here. It's rare that you see these ultrafamiliar paintings in such concentration; their combined presence gives the show a synergistic sparkle and energy that you don't get when you see them in smaller groupings. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, www.wadsworthatheneum.org.

        <p>* Sarah Sze: 'Corner Plot' The upper corner of an apartment building protrudes from the Doris C. Freedman Plaza's pavement as if the whole edifice had toppled and sunk into the ground. Through the window's of Ms. Sze's magical outdoor sculpture you can see a complicated interior that looks as if it were created by a mad architect. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)</p>

        <p>* GALERIE DANIEL BUCHHOLZ AT METRO PICTURES This well-known Cologne gallery presents a surprisingly sweeping view of current art that includes Americans and Europeans and, despite its Conceptual slant, an impressive range of mediums and sensibilities. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, (212) 206-7100, metropicturesgallery.com, through Sept. 16. (Smith)</p>
        <p>HANS RICHTER (1888-1976), DADA; ART AND ANTI-ART This daunting yet partial survey is clogged with late paintings and reliefs that are for the most part elegant pastiches of Constructivism, Cubism and Abstract Expressionism. But it should be seen for the four short films from the 1920's, in which Richter's formalist and Dada sides balance beautifully, with elegantly Surrealist results. This is especially the case in the luminous ''Ghosts Before Breakfast,'' from 1927, which explores most of film's structural possibilities and segues briskly between abstraction and Hollywood narrative, while three skittering bowler hats provide continuity. Maya Stendhal Gallery, 545 West 20th Street, (212) 366-1549, mayastendhalgallery.com, through Sept. 16. (Smith)</p>

        <p>'Zoo Story' A clay gorilla by Daisy Youngblood, a bronze she-wolf by Kiki Smith, a flock of concrete sheep by Françoise-Xavier Lalanne and works about animals by more than 20 other artists, including John Baldessari, Katharina Fritsch, Ross Bleckner and Rebecca Horn, turn the first floor of this sleek, three-story private museum into a diverting menagerie. Fisher Landau Center for Art, 38-27 30th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-0727, flcart.org through Oct. 16. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>* Met: 'Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings' This exhibition gets a huge gold A for truth in advertising. The treasures are plentiful, rare and splendid. Much of the work has never traveled before; many objects have only recently come to light in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. They add up to an exhibition as a think-piece essay on how a culture saw itself in the world. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes on Sunday.(Cotter)</p>
        <p>* Morgan Library and Museum: 'Masterworks from the Morgan'  Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's splendid four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels, medieval objects made with so much silver and gold that they seem to give off heat. What's not new: almost everything in this exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts, as well as illuminated gospels, devotional sculptures and historical and literary autograph manuscripts from the Brontës to Bob Dylan. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or www.themorgan.org; closes on Sunday.

        <p>MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'DADA' This is pretty much Dada's official survey (an oxymoron), and it makes nearly all 450 or so objects in it look elegant. That hat rack looks awfully stylish now. It's good to be reacquainted with a generation of artists who had no market to speak of and for whom society's corruption and exhaustion seemed golden opportunities to make themselves useful. Cynical and traumatized, the Dadaists were tireless young optimists at heart. They discovered a world full of wonders, and we are, on the whole, their beneficiaries. (212) 708-9400, moma.org; closes on Monday. (Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>* JAMES J. WILLIAMS III: 'BY REQUEST, MY EPITAPH' Despite debts to artists like Jack Pierson, Karen Kilimnik, Richard Prince and Nan Goldin, this Haversham-ish environment and solo debut exude a promising fusion of modesty and narcissism. Its deep teal walls display scores of Polaroids, drawings, collages, notebooks and thrift-shop-worthy paintings, along with many of the artist's well-worn belongings. An illusion of stylish, if impoverished, full disclosure results. Self-conscious bohemianism teeters between nostalgia and irony, and art emerges as an incessant if nonchalant activity at the center of an eked-out existence. Envoy, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-7524, envoygallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
