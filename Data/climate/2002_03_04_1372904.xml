        <p>The police released a photograph yesterday to try to identify a man arrested Saturday night in the Bronx carrying two homemade grenades and a loaded machine gun.</p>
        <p>The man, whom investigators described as emotionally disturbed, was being treated yesterday at Jacobi Medical Center and awaiting transfer to Bellevue Hospital Center for psychiatric evaluation, said Deputy Chief Joseph J. Reznick, the commander of detectives in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>Investigators have been unable to question the man thoroughly because he has been heavily sedated since his arrest in Co-op City, Chief Reznick said. Information that the man provided, including the name George Buko and a Bronx address, have proven to be false, the chief said. Detectives have been unable to identify the man by fingerprints, he said.</p>
        <p>''He seems to be a loner of some sort,'' Chief Reznick said. He said, however, that the man had access to dangerous weapons, ''and we need to go where that location is. God forbid someone else is in danger.''</p>
        <p>Investigators said he appeared to be in his 30's. He is white, 150 pounds and has brown eyes, brown hair and a full beard. He has an Eastern European accent, they said.</p>
        <p>The man was stopped by two officers around 6 p.m. while riding a bicycle on a sidewalk near the intersection of Co-op City Boulevard and Bellamy Loop, investigators said. There has been a spate of car break-ins in the area and the officers thought the man appeared suspicious, Chief Reznick said.</p>
        <p>When they asked for his identification, he tried to run and a scuffle broke out, investigators said. With the help of a passer-by, the officers were able to subdue the man, who was wearing a military-style bulletproof vest and a backpack containing ammunition and three small explosives fashioned from carbon dioxide cartridges, investigators said.</p>
        <p>During a search, the officers also recovered a Mac-10 machine gun, a .38-caliber revolver, two knives and two grenades containing a low-powered explosive, they said.</p>
        <p>The explosives were being tested by the department's bomb squad, the chief said. He said it was unclear whether there was enough powder in the grenades to make them explode.</p>
        <p>The man has been charged with weapons possession, assaulting an officer and resisting arrest.</p>
