        <p>Twenty-five states have given up trying to negotiate a settlement in their dispute over pollution that blows into the Northeast from the Midwest and South, meaning that the issue will be resolved in court, state officials said today.</p>
        <p>As 11 Northeast states from Maryland to Maine try to comply with the Clean Air Act, they have been trying to force 14 Middle Western and Southern states to sharply reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides. The United States Environmental Protection Agency took the side of the Northeast states, but after suffering some setbacks in court, it pressed the states to negotiate a deal.</p>
        <p>But this week, states on both sides rejected out of hand the first proposed compromise. Today, officials acknowledged that the talks, barely begun, were over.</p>
        <p>''We thought it would be a worthwhile process to see if there could be any common ground, but unfortunately, there's not,'' said John P. Cahill, New York's Environmental Conservation Commissioner, who had been the lead negotiator for the Northeast states. ''It's now a continued vigorous pursuit of the litigation.''</p>
        <p>In a series of conference calls yesterday, just 4 of the 14 states in the other camp were willing to accept the compromise, a fact that was relayed to Mr. Cahill this morning. It was not clear how many of the Northeast states might accept it, but Massachusetts had said it would not, and others expressed deep reservations. State and Federal officials had said that a negotiated deal could work only if all 25 states agreed to it.</p>
        <p>Summertime levels of ozone, or smog, in several urban areas in the Northeast, including New York City and its suburbs, exceed Federal standards. To comply with the Clean Air Act, the Northeast states are trying to curtail their levels of nitrogen oxides, a chemical group that contributes to the formation of ozone and acid rain.</p>
        <p>All of the Northeast states plan to adopt a new emissions standard of 0.15 pounds of nitrogen oxides per million British thermal units of power consumed, and they have asked the Environmental Protection Agency to impose the same standard on the Midwest and the South. They contend that much of the Northeast's pollution problem arrives on the prevailing winds from the other regions, a claim that Midwestern and Southern states contest.</p>
        <p>But the states of the Midwest and South have said they cannot accept any requirement lower than 0.25 pounds, which would represent a significant emissions reduction. Last week's compromise proposal would have required an initial 0.25 standard, dropping later to 0.2.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. announced last year that it planned to impose the 0.15 standard sought by the Northeast, but some of the other states went to court to block it. In May, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia postponed implementation of that plan, pending a hearing that is set for November.</p>
        <p>Environmental agency officials grew nervous about their chances in court and pushed the states to work out a deal on their own.</p>
        <p>If the E.P.A. fails in court, the Northeast states still have the ability to pursue their own lawsuits under the Clean Air Act.</p>
