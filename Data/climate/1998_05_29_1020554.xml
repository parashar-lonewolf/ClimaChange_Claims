        <p>The catalytic converter, an invention that has sharply reduced smog from cars, has now become a significant and growing cause of global warming, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>Hailed as a miracle by Detroit auto makers even today, catalytic converters have been reducing smog for 20 years. The converters break down compounds of nitrogen and oxygen from car exhaust that can combine with hydrocarbons, also from cars, and be cooked by sunlight into smog.</p>
        <p>But researchers have suspected for years that the converters sometimes rearrange the nitrogen-oxygen compounds to form nitrous oxide, known as laughing gas. And nitrous oxide is more than 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide, the most common of the gases that trap heat and warm the atmosphere like in a greenhouse, experts say.</p>
        <p>This spring, the E.P.A. published a study estimating that nitrous oxide now accounts for about 7.2 percent of the gases that cause global warming. Cars and trucks, most fitted with catalytic converters, produce nearly half of that nitrous oxide, the study said.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. has not proposed a solution at this point.</p>
        <p>Other sources of nitrous oxide include everything from nitrogen-based fertilizer to manure from farm animals.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A.'s study also showed that nitrous oxide is one of a few gases for which emissions are increasing rapidly. The gases are collectively known as greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>The increase in nitrous oxide, the study notes, stems from the growth in the number of miles traveled by cars that have catalytic converters. And the problem has worsened as improvements in the converters, changes that have eliminated more of the nitrogen-oxygen compounds that cause smog, have conversely produced more nitrous oxide.</p>
        <p>Wylie J. Barbour, an E.P.A. official who worked on the recently published study, said the problem created by the converter was classic: ''You've got people trying to solve one problem, and as is not uncommon, they've created another.''</p>
        <p>Nitrous oxide, or N2 O, is not regulated because the Clean Air Act was written in 1970 to control smog, not global warming. And no regulations exist to control greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>The United States and the other industrialized nations agreed in Kyoto, Japan, last December to lower emissions of greenhouse gases to 5 percent below 1990 levels, over the next 10 to 15 years, but the agreement has not been approved by the Senate and no implementing rules have been written.</p>
        <p>''This hadn't really been on people's radar screen until climate change started becoming an issue,'' said one E.P.A. official involved in reducing pollution from cars, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>Auto industry experts say they can solve the problem by tinkering with the catalytic converter, but some environmentalists suggest that the growing production of nitrous oxide is yet another reason to move away from gasoline-powered cars. The E.P.A.'s study estimated that nitrous oxide may represent about one-sixth of the global warming effect that results from gasoline use.</p>
        <p>Precisely how much nitrous oxide the converters produce remains an issue. A report used by the E.P.A. in preparing its greenhouse gas study calculated that a car with a fuel economy of about 19 miles a gallon would produce 0.27 grams of nitrous oxide per mile. That represents an amount that is about one-third the emissions for nitrogen oxide, the chemicals causing smog.</p>
        <p>Steven H. Cadle, a research scientist at General Motors, said, ''it's a huge number.'' In contrast, an older car without a catalytic converter produces much larger amounts of nitrogen oxides, but only about a tenth as much nitrous oxide, the greenhouse gas.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. calculated that production of nitrous oxide from vehicles rose by nearly 50 percent between 1990 and 1996 as older cars without converters have neared extinction. Using a standard unit of measure for global-warming gases, millions of metric tons of carbon equivalent, nitrous oxide emissions rose to 54.7 million tons from 36.7 million during those years, the study said.</p>
        <p>The contradictory impact of the converter has not been lost on environmental officials or industry experts, who continue to debate the extent of the growing problem as well as how to reduce the emissions in future years.</p>
        <p>Ned Sullivan, head of the Maine Department of Environmental Protection, said the converter problem requires a ''comprehensive'' response. ''This specific issue fits into a broader context that our regulatory system has tended to deal with pollutants on an individual, rather than a comprehensive, basis,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sullivan and others favor moving away from today's typical car design, a big gasoline engine driving the wheels, to electric cars. Another  solution is hybrid cars, which use small, efficient engines running on gasoline to help turn the wheels and to charge batteries for electric motors that also run the wheels. Those have much higher fuel economy, and thus lower greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
        <p>But car industry experts favor less drastic changes. They propose cutting nitrous oxide production by adjusting catalytic converters. They believe that redesigning the converters to reach optimum temperature faster would solve the problem and would also help them destroy other pollutants better.</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 2, 1998, Tuesday  A front-page headline on Friday about the contribution of automobiles' catalytic converters to global warming misstated the amount of nitrous oxide that the Environmental Protection Agency believes comes from the devices. A draft study by the E.P.A. said that about 3 percent comes from cars and trucks, out of a total contribution of 7 percent from all manmade sources. Cars and trucks alone do not account for 7 percent. In a statement issued yesterday in response to the article, the E.P.A. said the production of the gas by converters ''could be closer to 2 percent or less.''</p>
