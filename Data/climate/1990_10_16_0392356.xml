        <p>LEAD: AN iceberg the size of Long Island that broke away from Antarctica three years ago appears to have bogged down in pack ice, but during its 1,250-mile trip, the floating island has given scientists a wealth of data about some of the polar ocean currents believed to influence global climate.</p>
        <p>AN iceberg the size of Long Island that broke away from Antarctica three years ago appears to have bogged down in pack ice, but during its 1,250-mile trip, the floating island has given scientists a wealth of data about some of the polar ocean currents believed to influence global climate.</p>
        <p>Scientists from New Zealand's Conservation Department, Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory and the United States Joint Ice Center report that satellite observations of the iceberg's progress have established the existence of a complex system of currents along the Antarctic coast. The scientists report in the journal Antarctic Science that the nature and extent of these currents had previously been only surmised from indirect measurements.</p>
        <p>The object of the study, Iceberg B-9, broke away from Antarctica's Ross Ice Shelf between Sept. 25 and Oct. 13, 1987, changing the outline of the continent and obliterating one of its most famous features, the Bay of Whales. From a sheltered mooring in this ice-girt bay, Roald Amundsen set out in 1911 on his successful dog-sled trip to the South Pole, and in the 1930's and 1940's, Rear Adm. Richard E. Byrd of the Navy based his Little America camps on the ice shelf near the bay.</p>
        <p>B-9's immense size attracted scientific interest from the moment it was spotted in a satellite picture. At the time it was 96 miles long, 22 miles wide and 750 feet deep. It contained 287 cubic miles of fresh water, enough, Lamont-Doherty estimated, to provide everyone on earth with two glasses a day for the next 1,977 years.</p>
        <p>Dr. Stanley S. Jacobs, an oceanographer at Lamont-Doherty, said that although the iceberg was under observation by aircraft and ships, the best measurements of its dimensions and progress were made by satellites, including Landsat and polar-orbiting satellites operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Defense Department's meteorological satellite program. Tracking of B-9 became especially accurate after a radio beacon was dropped onto the iceberg.</p>
        <p>''Ships very rarely sail completely around bergs of this size, which stretch from horizon to horizon,'' he said. ''Shipboard estimates of size are notoriously inaccurate and lead to exaggerated fish stories.''</p>
        <p>Surprising Directions</p>
        <p>B-9's movements over a three-year period demonstrated the existence of four separate currents in the region, the scientists said. One current, which flows from east to west close to the Antarctic coast, proved to be only about seven miles wide, and as the berg passed through it, the current pressed successively against different sections of the ice, causing it to gyrate and change course. This narrow current is directly opposite to the much larger west-to-east circumpolar current that flows farther north.</p>
        <p>Another pair of currents was found to bring relatively warm water southward, where it flows under the gigantic Ross Ice Shelf, sinks, turns around and flows north again at a different depth.</p>
        <p>All these currents moved B-9 at speeds and in directions that surprised oceanographers. When the iceberg first broke loose it drifted slowly northward, and some scientists believed it would eventually move into the Drake Passage between Ross Island and New Zealand. But instead, the coastal current turned the berg around and thrust it into a southward warm-water current that carried it all the way back to the Ross Ice Shelf, with which it collided in August 1988.</p>
        <p>The berg rebounded slightly and drifted slowly away from the coast, first to the northwest and later, westward, accelerating to about eight miles a day. In August 1989, the berg was passing Cape Adair when it abruptly broke into three pieces, probably, Dr. Jacobs surmises, because of buffeting by waves.</p>
        <p>The three pieces, named B-9 A, B and C, continued westward past the Soviet base at Leningradskaya, where satellites have had no difficulty in tracking them on clear days; the smallest fragment, B-9C, is 17 miles long by 8 wide, and the largest, B-9B, is 63 miles long and 22 wide. Recently the three icebergs, widely separated, apparently stopped moving, and David Benner, a scientist at the Navy/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Joint Ice Center in Washington, said he believed they were mired in the pack ice that forms on the ocean surface during Antarctica's winters. With the coming of warmer weather this month, the bergs are expected to begin moving again, he said.</p>
        <p>Icy Equilibrium</p>
        <p>The huge flat-topped icebergs spawned by Antarctica rarely endanger maritime traffic because they generally remain in waters far south of shipping lanes. But the ebb and flow of Antarctica's ice sheet is of great interest to climatologists because of its relationship to questions like global warming from the greenhouse effect.</p>
        <p>The Antarctic ice sheet, which covers the continent, contains about 90 percent of the world's ice, and its melting would greatly alter the earth's sea level and climate. At present, this ice sheet is believed to be more or less in equilibrium; as glaciers, ice tongues and the great ice shelves slowly dump ice into the sea, snow falling over the continental ice sheet replenishes it at about the same rate.</p>
        <p>But determining if there is any imbalance in this rate is a complex problem scientists are urgently seeking to solve. The gain and loss of heat in Antarctica is strongly affected by ocean currents and complex interactions between the ocean and atmosphere, and scientists are using increasingly sophisticated mathematical models to work out the balance.</p>
        <p>''It is likely to be a decade or more before we see enough evidence in Antarctica to guess whether or not the global climate is changing and what effects such change may produce,'' Dr. Jacobs said. ''But meanwhile, clues from such things as B-9 are helping us to sketch in some details.''</p>
