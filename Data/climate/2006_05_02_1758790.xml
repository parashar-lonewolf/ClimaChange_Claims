        <p>Waters west of Africa that are a nursery for tropical storms have warmed over the last century in a pattern that appears largely to be a result of global warming related to human activities, federal scientists said. Such an increase in temperature, while only a few tenths of a degree, could increase the strength of hurricanes, which draw energy from tropical waters, said the scientists, writing in The Journal of Climate. The researchers, at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory of the Commerce Department, said computer simulations that took into account emissions of heat-trapping gases had replicated the warming trend much more realistically than did simulations that used only natural fluctuations in the climate.</p>
