        <p>Most of us can't imagine growing up among people for whom fame is the norm. Lynn Redgrave, the daughter of a celebrated couple whose friends and colleagues were celebrities too, grew up in just such a home. So there must have been an extra pang for her when, arriving at the grave of her maternal grandmother, the distinctly unfamous Beatrice Kempson, she found the headstone blank -- eroded by England's acid rain.</p>
        <p>Thus was ''Nightingale,'' Ms. Redgrave's one-woman play, born -- from her grief at that now anonymous grave and her determination to memorialize its occupant. The play, running through July 1 at the Hartford Stage, turns out to be an act of both perverse generosity and decided chutzpah, since Ms. Redgrave barely knew her grandmother and her grandmother had no apparent inclination to know her.</p>

        <p>Most of us can't imagine growing up among people for whom fame is the norm. Lynn Redgrave, the daughter of a celebrated couple whose friends and colleagues were celebrities too, grew up in just such a home. So there must have been an extra pang for her when, arriving at the grave of her maternal grandmother, the distinctly unfamous Beatrice Kempson, she found the headstone blank -- eroded by England's acid rain.</p>
        <p>Thus was ''Nightingale,'' Ms. Redgrave's one-woman play, born -- from her grief at that now anonymous grave and her determination to memorialize its occupant. The play, running through July 1 at the Hartford Stage, turns out to be an act of both perverse generosity and decided chutzpah, since Ms. Redgrave barely knew her grandmother and her grandmother had no apparent inclination to know her.</p>
        <p>Ms. Redgrave had already written dramatic reminiscences about her family. In her solo show ''Shakespeare for My Father,'' she detailed her yearning for recognition from the great British actor Michael Redgrave. Her mother, the admired actress Rachel Kempson, was the model for the betrayed and betraying wife in ''The Mandrake Root'' (Ms. Redgrave was among the stars in Long Wharf's 2001 production). But Ms. Redgrave has scant memories of Beatrice, who died in 1972, and those memories are far from pleasant ones. She was not only a ''chilly ghost of a granny'' to Lynn and her siblings, Vanessa and Corin, but also, it would seem, a remote and unloving mother to Ms. Kempson. Ms. Redgrave's solution? Call it a nonmemoir.</p>
        <p>''Nightingale'' is a fictionalized retelling of her grandmother's life, constructed from a handful of remembered anecdotes and research on what life was like for a typical, well-brought-up Englishwoman of her grandmother's day. Ms. Redgrave, playing the author-narrator, her grandmother (here named Mildred Asher), and all the other characters, has given herself a tough assignment, popping in on the protagonist at telling moments throughout her life and interweaving strands of her own biography -- most crucially, the breakup of her 32-year marriage.</p>
        <p>We meet Mildred first as a sullen child in church, complaining of the cold. But that damp, English cold is going to permeate her life, as one by one her older sisters marry and leave home; as she says yes to the first proposal she gets, just to end her loneliness; as she becomes aware, to her great disgust, of the physical side of marriage and as her revulsion overwhelms anything else she may feel for her firstborn, Rose. (Mildred's maternal instincts, such as they are, will be reserved for Rose's younger brother, Mark.) Bound by the conventions of the day, she follows all the rules and quietly takes out her unhappiness on those closest to hand, her husband and her daughter.</p>
        <p>Ms. Redgrave's supple, creamy voice changes as Mildred ages into a sad, unfulfilled old woman. And it yields a range of bass notes for Errol, Mildred's kindly but clueless husband, and for the rough-hewn Devon farmer who, too late, awakens Mildred's dormant sexuality. Ms. Redgrave, directed by Joseph Hardy, gets some help in telling her story from Tobin Ost's abstract design, a set of panels resembling a folding screen, and the exquisite lighting of Rui Rita and Jeff Nellis, who move us easily from a dappled church interior to a dimly lighted bedroom to a country barnyard. But mostly it is her skill as a performer that allows Ms. Redgrave to hold the stage for 90 minutes in the same elegantly cut slacks and classic jacket and make us believe that decades are rolling by. By the end, the alchemy of her acting has turned the natty jacket into a worn old cardigan.</p>
        <p>It has also turned our response to Mildred inside out. Normally we wouldn't have a lot of sympathy for this stony woman who, we know, marred many lives. But Ms. Redgrave summons her grandmother's ghost and imposes a narrative that attempts to show us why her emotional life was stunted. And even if that narrative is one that holds few surprises -- Victorian prudery and class-bound conventions have had to answer for a lot in the last century -- Ms. Redgrave's insistence on writing it turns out to be moving in and of itself.</p>
        <p>''Nightingale,'' by Lynn Redgrave, is at the Hartford Stage, 50 Church Street, through July 1. Information at (860) 527-5151 or hartfordstage.org.</p>
