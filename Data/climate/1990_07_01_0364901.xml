        <p>LEAD: President Bush's decision last week to limit offshore drilling demonstrates that hardly any politician can risk being seen as anti-environmental. The reason for this is the growth of the environmental consciousness among the American people.</p>
        <p>President Bush's decision last week to limit offshore drilling demonstrates that hardly any politician can risk being seen as anti-environmental. The reason for this is the growth of the environmental consciousness among the American people.</p>
        <p>Americans believe in economic growth. But a significant majority think that we can have economic growth and a cleaner environment. This is what we found in a new survey of 1,250 people we undertook with the Opinion Dynamics Corporation to assess how Americans think about the environment, energy and the economy.</p>
        <p>Seventy-four percent of the public we surveyed said that if they had to choose, they would select environmental cleanup and slower growth over economic growth. A large majority also says that it would reject political candidates who do not agree with the preference for environmental protection over economic growth - that is, if a choice has to be made. Environmentalism will increasingly be a litmus test for candidates.</p>
        <p>Underlying these attitudes is a strong streak of pessimism. A majority of Americans believes the nation's environment has become worse over the last year, and almost half think it will be in worse shape ten years from now. Both business and government suffer from a credibility gap.</p>
        <p>The public's response to the question of which environmental problems have most directly affected them indicates why clean air has been so compelling a cause. Half the respondents we interviewed said that they had been adversely affected by pollution - water, air, acid rain, and 29 percent said they had encountered respiratory or breathing problems.</p>
        <p>While the environmental consensus has emerged as a potent political force in the last few years, its strength, we found, would be tested in an economic downturn. After all, the focus on such concerns tended to recede during the economic slump of the 1970's. The consensus could also be challenged by the public's worries about the adequacy of energy supplies, we found.</p>
        <p>Although environmental anxieties currently outweigh economic concerns, 72 percent of the public thinks it is likely the United States will face problems getting an adequate supply of oil in the next 10 years. Most favor incentives to encourage domestic oil production and support offshore oil drilling to keep oil imports down. On the other hand, 81 percent think their local electricity supplies will be adequate in the next few years.</p>
        <p>Yet that is the energy shortage that could well develop the soonest, particularly in the Northeast. If so, that will mean the United States must confront some of the trade-offs and choices the over-supplied energy markets of the 1980's allowed us to avoid. It does not, however, mean that the environmental consensus will be overturned.</p>
