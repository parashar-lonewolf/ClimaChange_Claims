        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I read with interest ''Acid Rain: Plenty Bad Enough'' (editorial, Jan. 29), which strongly supports the need for Congress to enact national acid rain controls. As you indicate, the time to address this serious pollution problem has long since passed.</p>
        <p>While the recent work by the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program has been noteworthy, I believe some additional facts regarding acid rain damage in New York and the state's efforts to address the problem need to be identified.</p>
        <p>New York began documenting the effects of acid rain in the 1970's. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, in conjunction with the Empire State Electric Energy Research Corporation, recently completed a four-year survey of 1,469 Adirondack lakes. Your editorial states that 11 percent of the lakes in the southwestern Adirondacks are already acidified, and 36 percent are in danger of becoming so. The problem is more widespread.  The lakes study concluded that 24 percent of the Adirondack lakes are acidified and have a pH of less than 5. Eighteen percent of the lakes have a pH between 5 and 6, indicating that they have either been affected by acid rain or are threatened by this pollution. These results speak more strongly for immediate action than the assessment program's results.</p>
        <p>Obviously, whenever possible, political solutions should be based upon sound scientific judgments. In that spirit, I signed the State Acid Deposition Control Act in 1984. As a result of this initiative, the state has clearly identified three major areas that are especially sensitive to acid deposits: the Adirondacks, the Catskills and the Hudson Highlands. The 1984 law also set forth requirements to reduce the level of sulfur dioxide emissions from New York State sources.</p>
        <p>As a result, New York became the first state actually to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide in an effort to address the acid rain problem. In 1988 the first phase of reductions went into effect, and New York sulfur dioxide emissions have been reduced by more than 17 percent.</p>
        <p>In the absence of a national initiative, New York has, like Minnesota, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, acted on its own to require reductions in the emissions that cause acid rain. However, the interstate transport of acid rain and acid rain precursors makes it impossible for individual states alone to solve the acid rain problem. Congress must move now to implement an acid rain program as part of its clean air debate.</p>
        <p>Both Congress and the Administration have proposed a 10-million-ton reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions. We believe that, if properly targeted, 10 million tons is a reasonable minimum goal.</p>
        <p>In addition, we support a proposal made by both the Administration and Congress to establish a cap on future emissions to assure that the benefits from actions we take are not eliminated by future growth.</p>
        <p>New York State has led the way on acid rain control. I now repeat my plea to Congress and the Administration to resolve their remaining differences and to implement a strong national acid rain program that will protect New York, other areas of the country and Canada.</p>
