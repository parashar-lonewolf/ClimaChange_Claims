        <p>New Pentagon Report On Abusive Practices  A new Pentagon report finds that warning signs of serious abuses by the American military did not receive enough high-level attention, and that unit commanders did not get clear instructions that might have halted the abuses. Little control was exerted over interrogations in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Twenty bodies were found in a remote valley in Iraq near the Syrian border. The circumstances surrounding the bodies remained a mystery. Insurgents continued a wave of attacks that left at least 10 people dead, including two suicide car bombings in central Iraq and an attack on a police patrol in Basra, in the south, where violence has been rare in recent weeks.</p>
        <p>A10</p>
        <p>Report on Israeli Outposts  A report about the illegal financing of settlement outposts recommended that Israel consider criminal investigations. The report found widespread complicity and collusion to spend state money to build unauthorized and illegal outposts in contravention of stated policy and laws.</p>
        <p>A8</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Reinstated  Lebanon's pro-Syrian prime minister, Omar Karami, was forced to quit under pressure by opponents of Syria's occupation, but has now been voted back into the post by the Lebanese Parliament. The nomination of a Syria loyalist angered those who have sought an end to the influence of Damascus and threw the political system into deeper turmoil.</p>
        <p>A12</p>
        <p>Call for the I.R.A. to Disband  The United States envoy to Northern Ireland called on the Irish Republican Army to disband and on its political wing, Sinn Fein, to distance itself from crimes after the I.R.A. said it was willing to shoot the killers of a Belfast man. The sisters of the slain man will travel to Washington to campaign for the killers to be charged in court.</p>

        <p>Senate Budget Proposal Spurns Many Bush Tax Cuts  President Bush's plan to extend his tax cuts over the next five years ran into resistance in the Senate as Republican leaders, uneasy about the potential impact on the ballooning federal deficit, offered a budget for 2006 that would undo more than a fourth of the tax cuts that Mr. Bush is seeking.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Evangelicals on Global Warming  A group of influential evangelical leaders has put its political muscle behind fighting global warming, a cause that until now has barely registered on the evangelical agenda.</p>
        <p>A16</p>
        <p>Judge's Life Forever Changed  For Judge Joan Humphrey Lefkow, the target of an assassination plot for which a white supremacist was convicted last year, the killings of her husband and mother were the ultimate train wreck of what she called the ''two paradigms'' of her life, ambitious career woman and devoted mom.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Jackson's Accuser Testifies  The boy who has accused Michael Jackson of sexually molesting him testified for the first time, telling a court that Mr. Jackson coached him two years ago to say that he had been cured of cancer as a result of the singer's kindness.</p>
        <p>A18</p>
        <p>U.S. Leaves World Judicial Body  Prompted by an international tribunal's decision last year ordering new hearings for 51 Mexicans on death row in the United States, the State Department said the United States has withdrawn from the protocol that gave the tribunal jurisdiction to hear such disputes.</p>
        <p>A16</p>
        <p>L.A. Mayor's Race Down to Two  Antonio Villaraigosa, a Latino member of the Los Angeles City Council, finished first in the nonpartisan mayoral primary and will face Mayor James K. Hahn, who finished second, in a May runoff election.</p>

        <p>A Mole Disrupts the Mob  An undercover F.B.I. agent who posed as a mob muscleman has helped bring down a new generation of bosses in the Gambino organized-crime family, federal law enforcement officials said.</p>
