        <p>Near the end of its sold-out concert on Thursday night at Irving Plaza, the hardcore punk-rock band Shelter passed the microphone to audience members to determine who in the crowd had the worst job. A gas-station attendant appeared to be the winner, until one person yelled that he worked in a slaughterhouse. Some punk bands might find a slaughterhouse job glamorous, but for Shelter, a band of Hare Krishnas (four out of five members) with songs trumpeting the truth of the Bhagavad-Gita and condemning meat eaters as murderers, that job is  anathema.</p>
        <p>In "Civilized Man," the band's singer, Ray Cappo, railed against meat eating  with venom, throwing in statistics and even references to the depletion of rain  forests and the ozone layer. These are not subjects most punk fans want to slam-dance to, but Shelter backs up its point with a fast beat, vocals as coherent as a rap song and catchy, shout-along choruses.</p>

        <p>Near the end of its sold-out concert on Thursday night at Irving Plaza, the hardcore punk-rock band Shelter passed the microphone to audience members to determine who in the crowd had the worst job. A gas-station attendant appeared to be the winner, until one person yelled that he worked in a slaughterhouse. Some punk bands might find a slaughterhouse job glamorous, but for Shelter, a band of Hare Krishnas (four out of five members) with songs trumpeting the truth of the Bhagavad-Gita and condemning meat eaters as murderers, that job is  anathema.</p>
        <p>In "Civilized Man," the band's singer, Ray Cappo, railed against meat eating  with venom, throwing in statistics and even references to the depletion of rain  forests and the ozone layer. These are not subjects most punk fans want to slam-dance to, but Shelter backs up its point with a fast beat, vocals as coherent as a rap song and catchy, shout-along choruses.</p>
        <p>The six-year-old band, which includes members of such respected hardcore bands as the Cro-Mags and Youth of Today (which was advocating a clean, responsible life style in hardcore songs a decade ago), is accepted not only in  the small circle of Hare Krishna hardcore bands in New York, but also in the national punk scene. Tim Armstrong of the top-40 California punk band Rancid stood in front of the stage snapping pictures throughout the show, capturing Mr. Cappo's many leaps off the stage to walk on the heads and shoulders of audience  members.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cappo was a squat bundle of energy, jumping incessantly and kicking his feet karate-style into the air as he spit out songs, most of them from his new album, "Mantra" (Roadrunner), that universalized Hare Krishna beliefs into general messages of unity, respect and faith. The band's guitars and bass wandered down different paths during each verse, cohering into synchronous rhythms during the choruses as Mackie, the drummer, pounded out rapid eighth notes. The music wasn't an assault; it was an outcry, an intolerant caterwaul designed to gain converts to a life style of tolerance.</p>
