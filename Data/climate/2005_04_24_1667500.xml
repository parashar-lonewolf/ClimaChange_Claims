        <p>David Mejias, a Nassau County legislator, is proposing legislation to give tax incentives to people who buy fuel-efficient hybrid gas and electric cars.</p>
        <p>His proposal would eliminate the county's $15 registration fee and the county's portion of the sales tax, which would save buyers of hybrid cars an estimated $200 to $250.</p>
        <p>''It is my hope that this county tax break, coupled with tax incentives at the state and federal level, will encourage more drivers to purchase a hybrid,'' Mr. Mejias said in a news release.</p>
        <p>The market for hybrid cars is still very small, with about 7,000 in use across the state and 400 registered in Nassau County. Mr. Mejias said the tax incentives would help defray the cost of hybrid cars, which he said cost $3,000 to $6,000 more than conventional models.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mejias said that he also planned to petition state officials to exempt hybrids from the two-passenger rule for using the high-occupancy-vehicle lanes in Nassau County.</p>
        <p>''This makes sense both financially and environmentally,'' he said. ''It helps reduce traffic and greenhouse gases and saves money on skyrocketing gas costs.''</p>
