        <p>Deciding that one of the most ambitious nuclear power programs in the nation has solved longstanding design and management problems, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission today approved the restart of a nuclear reactor at the Browns Ferry plant in Alabama.</p>
        <p>The decision, which could open the plant's Unit 2 reactor within 10 days, was hailed today by the Tennessee Valley Authority, which owns and operates the reactor in northern Alabama, and by others in the nuclear power industry as a significant vote of confidence for the utility and the industry.</p>
        <p>The reactor has been shut for more than six years, the longest shutdown for repairs in the history of the American civilian nuclear power program.</p>
        <p>"The restart of any plant after an extended outage is a sign of an industry where problems are corrected after they are brought to light," said Steve Unglesbee, a spokesman for the United States Council for Energy Awareness, a nuclear power industry trade group in Washington.</p>
        <p>Critics of nuclear power denounced the action, saying that the regulatory agency exempted Browns Ferry, just outside Athens, Ala., from a number of crucial safety guidelines, most having to do with the plant's ability to fight fires.</p>
        <p>They noted that on Monday, a fire and explosion shut a nuclear power plant in Maine indefinitely. The accident occurred in a transformer and generator at the plant and did not release any radiation to the public.</p>
        <p>Although there have been no new orders for nuclear power plants in 17 years, many operators, including the T.V.A., have indicated that they would like to build new plants this decade. The Bush Administration has begun an aggressive nuclear program within the Department of Energy aimed at designing a standard type of reactor that would be almost immune from meltdown. It also wants to streamline licensing of new plants.</p>
        <p>The Administration has said it believes nuclear power is safe and produces less pollution than conventional power plants. The pollution argument is beginning to gain ground even among some environmentalists, who have generally opposed nuclear power but who increasingly view conventional power plants as heavy contributors to global warming and acid rain.  New Design Being Studied</p>
        <p>The Administration says one new reactor design being considered by the Energy Department for producing materials for nuclear weapons can also be applied to generating electrical power.  The design under consideration would consist of four small reactors using tiny uranium pellets for fuel and would be cooled by hydrogen.</p>
        <p>Records from the N.R.C. also show that 12 years after the accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant near Harrisburg, Pa., utilities have improved operations at nuclear plants. Commercial nuclear power plants are experiencing fewer unplanned shutdowns, fewer accidents and incidents, and are more reliable than ever, the agency says. The number of unplanned shutdowns dropped to an average of 1.6 per plant in 1990 from 7.4 in 1980, according to the N.R.C.</p>
        <p>How important these improvements are in swaying public opinion in favor of nuclear power remains to be seen.</p>
        <p>Some environmentalists say that the mining, milling, and processing of uranium for fuel is a dirty and ecologically dangerous business. The Government also has been unable to reach a safe and permanent solution for disposing of dangerous radioactive wastes.  Staking Their Futures</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, large utilities, especially the T.V.A., are again beginning to stake their futures on generating electrical power from the atom.</p>
        <p>"The decision today was a substantial milestone for this company," said Dan A. Nauman, T.V.A.'s senior vice president for nuclear power. "We worked so hard to get here. Since 1985, people have been working seven days a week to get to this point."</p>
        <p>Political leaders in Alabama were pleased. State Representative Bobby Denton, a Democrat who lives about 40 miles from the plant, said: "It's great news for the Tennessee Valley region to be close to seeing the plant finally begin producing electricity again. Hopefully, Browns Ferry can now become the model program it was expected to be from the start."</p>
        <p>Mayor Eddie Frost of Florence said: "Federal regulators would not allow the unit to be started again if there was a great risk. I'm confident all the problems have been solved." Florence is about 30 miles west of Athens.</p>
        <p>Indeed, many residents of Alabama seem unalarmed, even uninterested. "To most people it seems like a done deal," said Pat Byington, executive director of the Alabama Conservancy, an environmental group in Birmingham. "Nobody is talking about it very much."  Early, Heady Days Recalled</p>
        <p>The Browns Ferry plant was once the world's largest commercial nuclear plant, a symbol of the atom's intoxicating power. Built at a cost of $1 billion, its first reactor opened in 1974. Two more followed in 1975 and 1977, generating 1,100 megawatts each. The Browns Ferry plant was seen by T.V.A. as the cornerstone of an empire of 17 nuclear power plants the utility planned to build across the South at a cost of tens of billions of dollars.</p>
        <p>But soon after it opened, Browns Ferry also became a symbol of the capricious perils of nuclear energy. In March 1975, while the plant was operating at peak power, a workman searching with a candle for an air leak in the plant's cable room accidentally ignited a fire that caused more than $100 million in damage. The fire, which burned below the control room and nearly led to a catastrophe, was one of the worst civilian nuclear power accidents in the United States.</p>
        <p>Over the next decade, a series of investigations by the N.R.C. and other agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, uncovered significant weaknesses in the design, management and operation of Browns Ferry and its sister, the Sequoyah nuclear plant north of Chattanooga, Tenn., which opened in 1981.  Three Mile Island Shock</p>
        <p>The inquiries, coupled with higher operating costs and the public uneasiness prompted by the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island, caused the T.V.A. nuclear program to collapse in the mid-1980's. Browns Ferry and Sequoyah were closed. Work on two other nuclear plants ceased. The adventure in nuclear power cost the T.V.A. at least $20 billion and nearly bankrupted the utility.</p>
        <p>T.V.A. executives defended their decision to develop a nuclear power program as vital to the economic growth of the utility and the region it served. In 1988, after an expensive repair program, the T.V.A. gained permission from the N.R.C. to restart both reactors at the Sequoyah plant.</p>
        <p>The repair program at Browns Ferry has been more expensive, costing more than $1.3 billion to date.</p>
        <p>Unit 2 must undergo several more tests before final permission is granted by the N.R.C. administrator in Atlanta to restart it. Mr. Nauman said Unit 3 could be restarted in 1994 and Unit 1 sometime before the end of the decade. The N.R.C. said Browns Ferry was the last nuclear plant left in the United States to restart after an extended shutdown. Four others have been restarted after long shutdowns since 1985.</p>
        <p>"It was kind of a black eye for the nuclear industry that Browns Ferry was down," said Mr. Nauman. "Bringing it back on line means it has been brought to today's standard of operation. This plant will produce electricity for a long time."</p>
        <p>Critics of the industry said today that the N.R.C. appeared to be especially lenient in its consideration of Browns Ferry. The T.V.A. sought, and the four-member commission specifically granted, an exemption for Browns Ferry from several fire-safety requirements that were made into law as a result of the 1975 accident at the plant. For instance, the commission ordinarily requires nuclear plants to have automatic fire-suppression equipment in backup control rooms. Browns Ferry, though, will be able to use fire extinguishers.</p>
        <p>The N.R.C. rules also ordinarily requires fire-fighting equipment for key pumps. Browns Ferry will not need to have the fire-fighting equipment, according to commission documents, because the T.V.A. felt that if a fire developed near the pumps it would not burn for very long.</p>
        <p>"These exemptions are authorized by law and will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety," the N.R.C. wrote.</p>
        <p>Several groups today said they were upset with the exemptions and the decision to restart Browns Ferry. "It is ironic that here is the plant that had a fire in March 1975 that led to these rules and now they are granted exemptions to fire-protection regulations," said Robert D. Pollard, the nuclear safety engineer at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington.</p>
