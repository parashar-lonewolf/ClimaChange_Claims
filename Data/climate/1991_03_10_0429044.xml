        <p>IT is a bright morning at 7. Suspiciously bright and mild for Newark Airport in February, causing one to think "greenhouse effect." Causing one who is wont to think of the greenhouse effect to think of it, anyway. Causing one who obsesses about the greenhouse effect to think of it yet again. The sun is streaming through the aircraft's lozenge window as we ignore our flight attendant's drill on airline safety.</p>

        <p>IT is a bright morning at 7. Suspiciously bright and mild for Newark Airport in February, causing one to think "greenhouse effect." Causing one who is wont to think of the greenhouse effect to think of it, anyway. Causing one who obsesses about the greenhouse effect to think of it yet again. The sun is streaming through the aircraft's lozenge window as we ignore our flight attendant's drill on airline safety.</p>
        <p>"Pull down the shade," I suddenly tell my daughter.</p>
        <p>"Why?"</p>
        <p>"I just remembered an article I read, that a lot of airline pilots are getting skin cancer, flying around up there with all that thinned-out ozone and, who knows, maybe being a mile closer to the sun or something. I guess the ultraviolet rays can even get to them through glass and steel and pressurized cabins. Just pull it down."</p>
        <p>"But I like to see."</p>
        <p>"Oh." People do like to see when they're flying. They like to look out at clouds and cities and sea and mountains. I used to, too. "Well, O.K. . . . so what the heck did I do with my sunscreen?"</p>
        <p>My husband patiently undoes his seat belt, stands and hands me our carry-on bag from the overhead storage. Number 45 is right there in the zippered case, along with the zinc oxide, lip screen and number 39. I slather 45 generously on my nose and cheeks. Actually, I applied sunscreen when I got up this morning, as I do every morning these days, but it doesn't seem enough now.</p>
        <p>I was comforted later to learn that ultraviolet rays do not pass through glass, but in any case I share the pilots' plight. In fact, I had the stitches removed from my latest surgery just a week ago. The waiting room of the skin cancer surgeon is crowded. It is not a pretty picture. It is fresh in my memory. And this morning we are wantonly flying off to Costa Rica.</p>
        <p>Perhaps I shouldn't think of skin cancer as a constant. After all, each of the four basal cell carcinomas I've had on my face in the last 15 years was removed with a minimum of scarring. They were removed, is the point. They are gone. And yet I can't help a certain proprietary feeling about the disease. "It's there," said one dermatologist. "There's something there. Wear sunscreen all the time. And never, ever sunbathe. Listen, if you're gonna get cancer this is a really good kind to get. It's very slow-growing and it hardly ever metastasizes." So I know I should be grateful for the good kind. But still, I worry sometimes because it's my face.</p>
        <p>It's there because I had X-ray treatments for acne when I was a teen-ager. I didn't even have that much acne, but because I was a doctor's daughter, I got the state-of-the-art treatment for the 1960's. The rays in the treatments are the same as the rays in the sun. "Think of the sun's rays as death rays," was how another dermatologist put it.</p>
        <p>But remember when we and the Beach Boys thought of them as bennies; when Mom told you to get a tan so you'd be healthy? "You were the sun queen," one of my sisters reminded me recently. "You were always in the backyard with your reflector and the baby oil and iodine. Remember?"</p>
        <p>Oh, I am horrified to think I ever lay in the sun. One of my recurring anxiety dreams is being out on the high seas in an open boat without a hat or number 45.</p>
        <p>The way I rationalized this trip was by telling myself that Costa Rica, because of its enlightened government, has rain forests. They sounded dark. And when was I going to see a rain forest in this life, with them going as fast as they are and, need I say, causing the greenhouse effect in the process? So we spent part of our first day in Costa Rica hiking in a rain forest in the mountains of Braulio Carrillo National Park north of San Jose. It was dark, very dark. We saw a toucan, orchids, a rainbow and a magnificent waterfall. It was muddy and cool and rainy there in the jungle. If we hit a sunny spot I could hide under a really gigantic succulent leaf called The Poor Man's Umbrella that grows in such abundance there. I could be safe in the rain forest. "We can stay here," I told my family. But no, they wanted . . . sun.</p>
        <p>NOTHING would do but driving three hours to the Pacific coast next day in midday, with the sun streaming through the car windows. I sat in the relative shade of the back seat, wearing 45, zinc oxide and a wide-brimmed hat with a large scarf hanging emir-style down the sides. They wouldn't be satisfied until we drove across this peaceful land of friendly people and breathtaking beauty, along narrow roads lined with vivid flowering trees, the jacaranda and the poro, past banana plantations, open-air roadside cafes called "sodas" and hills terraced with coffee plants. Machete-carrying men in straw hats looked up as we passed. "Living fences" formed from straight lines of growing trees enclosed herds of lethargic humpbacked cattle. We slowed behind tractors pulling a harvest of coffee, and once came to a screeching stop for an iguana to cross the road.</p>
        <p>My family wouldn't rest until we reached our beach, Playa Esterillos Este, seven wide white miles of it with only our little hotel of 16 units and a few scattered cabins. Seven miles of beach on the Equator makes for a whole lot of sun, which I regret to report shone unremittingly for the four days we were there, 12 solid hours each day. They were lonely hours, as I was largely unattended by those self-serving sun-seekers I call my family. How did I cope, you well may ask. It wasn't easy, but I tell you now, painful as it is to recount, so that others may benefit from my experience.</p>
        <p>I was driven to drink. Costa Rica's delicious Imperial Beer in particular. Also pina coladas. I practiced my Spanish, constructing such complex sentences as, "Esta mas que la botella de vino blanco de anoche, por favor, senor?" and "Un otro rum y coca, por favor, senor." In my desperation, food took on a great importance. I was always early for meals, consoling myself with full T-bone dinners priced at 600 colones ($6).</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, I was forced to spend a significant portion of each day sitting in the Hotel Delfin's terra cotta arcade, taking in the view and the zephyrs while rereading "Emma." Jane Austen provided me with some solace, especially as I was able to identify for the first time with Mr. Woodhouse, Emma's hypochondriacal father. I especially liked the part where Mr. Woodhouse says he never had much opinion of the sea air. "I am sure it almost killed me once."</p>
        <p>Pity me not, I said to my family, and wore a cover-up that fell in tragical folds. And, you must believe me, I found a kind of happiness at Playa Esterillos Este drinking pinas on the portico of my hotel. But the beach and ocean nagged at me. They were there and I was there. My guilt-ridden family implored me to join them.</p>
        <p>And so finally I did, running with them into the surf as a cock crowed and the boat on the brightening horizon turned off its beacon. Mr. Woodhouse would have been shocked, though the water was warm, even at dawn. That evening at sunset I walked the beach, the palm trees heavy and dark against the glorious streaked sky. And if my pleasure was somewhat circumscribed I hardly noticed at those moments. Life has its limitations. It's a beach, they say. And all the world's a playa. But this one is so lovely.</p>
