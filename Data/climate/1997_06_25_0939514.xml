        <p>Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York  threw his support today behind the embattled Environmental Protection Agency and its proposals to toughen air quality standards, promising that he would lead a fight in Congress against any lawmakers who opposed them.</p>
        <p>In a letter to President Clinton, Mr. D'Amato joined other Republican figures from the Northeast, including Gov. George E. Pataki of New York, who, as leaders of states downwind of pollution that drifts from big Midwestern plants, have spoken out  in defense of the environmental agency's efforts to tighten the standards, dealing with smog and soot.</p>
        <p>''I want to make sure you are aware,'' Mr. D'Amato wrote the President, ''that I will take a leadership role in fighting any legislative effort to delay, weaken or block these important new public health safeguards.''</p>
        <p>Mr. D'Amato's position could be especially important, both because he is an influential Republican fund-raiser and because he expressly promised to fight for the proposals rather than merely voicing some measure of support for them. To the dismay of environmental groups, the White House has left the environmental agency's Administrator, Carol M. Browner, to defend the proposals nearly single-handedly.</p>
        <p>The proposals, which are still under final review at the White House,  are the top priority of leading environmental and public health advocacy groups but are opposed by a powerful coalition of industries, which contend that they would cost far more than they are worth.</p>
        <p>White House economic advisers have also sought to weaken the proposals, and the agency's opponents in Congress have suggested that they might work to overturn any such  rules adopted, using new powers of regulatory review enacted by the 104th Congress.</p>
        <p>The rules at issue, proposed by the E.P.A. last November, would tighten  standards on the amounts of permitted ozone and tiny sooty particles, on the ground that current standards do not adequately protect asthmatic children, the elderly and outdoors workers.</p>
        <p>The proposals would throw hundreds of counties out of compliance with the Clean Air Act, requiring states to impose new restrictions on pollution, mainly from the burning of fossil fuels. Electric power companies and other industries would probably bear most of the costs.</p>
        <p>The proposals resulted from a provision in the Clean Air Act requiring  that air quality standards be reviewed every five years, with use of  the latest scientific evidence. After a suit by environmental groups, a Federal court ordered the Clinton Administration to issue a final decision on the matter by July.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists, who have been awaiting the White House's decision on the proposals with trepidation, said today that they were cheered by Mr. D'Amato's support, which they described as a reminder that the air quality debate was not one that broke on partisan lines.</p>
        <p>''D'Amato goes to the head of the class on the Republican side,'' said Gene Karpinski, executive director of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. ''It would be embarrassing for the Administration to come out with a proposal any weaker than what E.P.A. proposed and what Senator D'Amato supports.''</p>
        <p>With Mr. Clinton undecided about how strong a rule to issue, and with the court-imposed deadline forcing a decision soon, lawmakers on both sides of what has turned into the most divisive environmental debate of the decade have been circulating one letter after another pressing their views on the White House.</p>
        <p>The proposals' supporters have been especially worried since Senator John H. Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican long viewed as pro-environment, voiced his opposition to them. Other opponents include powerful Democrats like Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, the ranking minority member of the House Commerce Committee, which oversees application of the Clean Air Act.</p>
        <p>Mr. D'Amato's letter to the White House also signals the usefulness of a strong pro-environmental stance as he faces re-election next year. His strategy has included vocal support for a statewide $1.2 billion environmental bond issue last year, and for protecting the Sterling Forest, on New York's border with New Jersey.</p>
        <p>''Pollution hurts us all,'' his letter said. ''It is one of the major causes of diseases ranging from cancer to respiratory diseases including asthma. In New York State, more than 300,000 children suffer from this painful and serious disease, including four of my own seven grandchildren. It is serious, and we can do something about it.''</p>
        <p>Like the proposals' other Northeastern supporters, including the two Republican Senators from Maine and the Republican Governors of New Jersey and Massachusetts, Mr. D'Amato noted that clamping down on soot and smog from Midwestern utilities would help improve the air quality in downwind states.</p>
        <p>In an interview, he said the smog that crosses state lines ''is like terrorism, and we are sponsoring a form of pollution terrorism by allowing this to take place.''</p>
