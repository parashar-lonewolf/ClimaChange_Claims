        <p>MANHATTAN: ADOPTION CASE THROWN OUT -- A judge ruled yesterday that a case involving a New Mexico couple who are accused of kidnapping an infant from New York more than two decades ago and raising him as their son should not be dealt with in Family Court. The Family Court judge, Guy P. DePhillips, said that the case could not be treated as an adoption case because adoption papers were never filed. He said the matter is now up to the criminal court system, which is deciding what should happen to Barry and Judith Smiley, who are charged with kidnapping. Barry Smiley, above, who is free on bail, was in court yesterday. Judith Smiley did not appear, citing ill health.</p>

        <p>OAKDALE: BILL ON PHYSICIAN HANDWRITING -- Citing a government report that prescription-drug errors could be cut by two-thirds if doctors stopped writing orders by hand, a state assemblyman has proposed a bill requiring New York physicians to type or electronically print prescriptions. Assemblyman Steve Levy, Democrat of Holbrook on Long Island, said yesterday that the bill, which the Health Committee is reviewing, would help end poor penmanship as a factor in patients getting the wrong drug or the wrong dosage. The bill is supported by the Long Island division of the Pharmacist Society of the State of New York. The state's Medical Society has no position on the bill.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: REEF OF SUBWAY CARS -- Subway cars that have been serving New Yorkers for nearly 40 years will be sunk in the Atlantic Ocean at least eight miles off Ocean City, Md. Last week, New York City Transit and Ocean City agreed to take as many as 1,300 subway cars off New York's tracks sometime this summer and sink them to create an artificial reef. The regional oceanographer with the Environmental Protection Agency, William C. Muir, dismissed concerns that paint and asbestos from the subway cars would harm the environment, saying they would not be present in high enough concentrations. Earlier this week, New Jersey rejected the plan because of similar concerns.</p>

        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>JERSEY CITY: COMPLETE CITY AUDIT RELEASED -- The complete version of an independent audit of the Jersey City government was released yesterday by the State Department of Community Affairs, and it concluded that that city's government was unwieldy and lacked accountability. Parts of the audit were leaked to the news media this week and created a political furor because of its implied criticism of the administration of Mayor Bret D. Schundler, a candidate for governor. The audit, by Arthur Andersen, made 51 recommendations for changes, which the company said could increase annual revenues by $1.5 million and cut annual spending by $3.8 million.</p>

        <p>ISELIN: BIAS CRIMES ALLEGED -- Civil-rights groups plan to condemn two separate instances of what they described as racist vandalism: one at the home and business of a South Asian man and another at a Holocaust memorial. The groups, including the New Jersey Anti-Defamation League, plan a news conference today at Pradip Kothari's travel agency, Quick Travel, in Iselin. Last Saturday eggs were thrown at Mr. Kothari's building, his cars and his home. Also that day, feces was found at the memorial at the Forrestal Village Center in Plainsboro. The police said they were investigating the incidents as possible bias crimes.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: BILL TO CURB BELT ARRESTS -- New Jersey police officers would be forbidden to arrest and handcuff motorists who break the state's seat belt law under  legislation being drafted by a state senator. State Senator Raymond Lesniak, Democrat of Union, announced the legislation yesterday in response to a decision this week by the United States Supreme Court. The justices ruled against a Texas woman handcuffed in front of her small children and briefly jailed for failing to wear a seat belt. Mr. Lesniak, who sponsored the state's seat belt law, said the court decision was an ''outrageous and unjustified defense of abusive police force.''</p>

        <p>MORRISTOWN: EX-STUDENTS SUE PRISON OVER ATTACK -- Four Mount Olive high school graduates are suing the state's Department of Corrections, alleging it tried to cover up a 1999 attack on them at a state youth detention center in Middlesex County during a school field trip. The lawsuit brought by Nicholas Rimassa, Jay O'Connor, Travis Alderman and Christopher Stroud also names the state's Juvenile Justice Commission, the Mount Olive school district and high school, and three corrections officers and four juvenile inmates.</p>

        <p>NEW HAVEN: NURSING-HOME STRIKE PREPARATIONS -- Nurse's aides, food and maintenance workers who held a one-day strike at 40 nursing homes last month are prepared to again leave their jobs at the same homes next week, union officials said yesterday. The possible strike dates are staggered. Workers at 7 of the 40 nursing homes will walk out Tuesday and will remain on strike for as long as it takes to meet their demands for increased staffing and higher wages, said Deborah Chernoff, a spokeswoman for the New England Health Care Employees Union, District 1199. On Wednesday, workers at nine more homes will strike and on Thursday, workers at the remaining 24 homes will walk out.</p>

        <p>Correction:  April 28, 2001, Saturday  A headline in the Metro Briefing column yesterday about a New Mexico couple accused of having kidnapped an infant in New York two decades ago misstated the location of the court that held a hearing on jurisdiction.
