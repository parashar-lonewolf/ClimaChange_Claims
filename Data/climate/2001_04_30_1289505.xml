        <p>In the final calculation, Jann Wenner has only himself to blame for the brand-new music magazine, backed by Felix Dennis, that will arrive on newsstands next week and compete with Mr. Wenner's august flagship, Rolling Stone.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Wenner can only blame himself for the hugely successful raunchy men's magazine Maxim, which competes in part with readers for Men's Journal, which Wenner Media also publishes.</p>
        <p>Why? Because Mr. Dennis, the owner and founder of Dennis Publishing, the publisher of Maxim and Stuff in the United States, got his first big paycheck from Mr. Wenner 28 years ago, and used that as the seed money for his magazine ventures. Next week, Mr. Dennis will start selling Blender, a magazine that will cover music with a Maxim-esque sensibility: along with the CD reviews come frat-house humor and lush photos of semidressed pop stars.</p>
        <p>''Not to be nasty to the guy who bankrolled me,'' Mr. Dennis said in an interview in his New York office last week, ''but Rolling Stone is so boring, so corporate.''</p>
        <p>It will take more than criticism of his competition to make his magazine a hit. The field of music magazines has in the last five years grown from a fairly small group that was once dominated by behemoths like Rolling Stone and Spin to include more niche titles like The Source. And Mr. Dennis enters the music field at a time of seriously soft advertising, which has been compounded for music magazines by the federally mandated, almost total disappearance of tobacco advertising from their pages in the last year.</p>
        <p>Rolling Stone's ad pages are down 36 percent, to 128 from 201, and ad revenue is off 24 percent from last year for the two March issues, from a reported $17.3 million to $13 million, according to the Publishers Information Bureau. Circulation is off, as well. Single-copy sales were down 5.6 percent for the six-month period that ended December 2000, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations.</p>
        <p>Spin, owned by Miller Publishing, is not having a great year, either. Its newsstand sales are down 15.8 percent, according to the bureau. Advertising is down 16 percent for the March issues. Vibe, also owned by Miller, is down 15 percent in advertising, and its newsstand sales are down 11 percent. Only The Source, which is privately owned, is up in both newsstand sales -- 7 percent -- and advertising pages and revenue -- 6 and 19 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dennis is quick to point out that The Source is a niche title, focusing on rap and hip-hop, while Blender, like Rolling Stone, will cover a wide range of music-related topics. The first issue includes articles about ''The Return of Hair Metal;'' D. J. Clue, the hip-hop radio D.J.; the Olivia Newton-John renaissance and country-and-western rappers.</p>
        <p>In fact, Blender is as eclectic a mix as Mr. Dennis himself. By the early 1970's Mr.Dennis -- who travels between homes in London, New York and Mustique -- was an impoverished high-school dropout who had played drums in a rock band. He was struggling to make a living off of a satire publication he co-founded called Oz. In 1971, he had been sentenced to nine months in prison for obscenity; cash was tight. In 1973, in an attempt to make some extra money, he wrote a quickie biography of Bruce Lee, the martial artist and movie star.</p>
        <p>''No one had heard of Bruce Lee, and I thought we might sell 20,000 copies in Hong Kong,'' Mr. Dennis said, waving an unashed Silk Cut cigarette. Then the 32-year-old Mr. Lee died suddenly of a brain edema. The typical media frenzy surrounding celebrity death ensued. And Mr. Wenner, whom Mr. Dennis had met through Mick Jagger, offered to publish the biography, just completed, under his Straight Arrow publishing imprint, and a British publisher -- that normally published ''books about Lao Tzu,'' Mr. Dennis said -- agreed to also.</p>
        <p>''Suddenly everyone had a million-copy seller on their hands,'' Mr. Dennis, who is 52, said. ''So Jann was responsible for handing me my first big paychecks,'' he said with a victorious chortle.</p>
        <p>Of course, he has plenty to smirk about. Three years ago, Mr. Dennis brought Maxim to the United States. Before an audience of skeptics, the monthly compendium of seminude starlets and ribald humor became the best-selling general-interest men's title in the United States, a steroid-addled weightlifter of a magazine pumped up with advertising, in contrast to competitors like Esquire and GQ, which, next to Maxim, are, to use a phrase one might find in that magazine, flabby girly-men.</p>
        <p>Emboldened, Mr. Dennis will have in two months started up three magazines at a time when most American publishers are not starting up the microwave to reheat last night's leftovers for lunch at their desks, let alone any new magazines.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, Dennis Publishing began publishing The Week, a quirky news digest that features headlines like ''The threat of global warming'' along with ''The shelf life of sperm'' and ''Do stupid people die sooner?'' (The answer, according to The Week, is yes.) Mr. Dennis said he expected the bulk of the magazine's revenue to come from readers willing to pay $75 a year for a weekly subscription.</p>
        <p>A month ago, he began Maxim Fashion, a fashion quarterly for men. Going beyond cashmere sweaters and cologne, the magazine also features items like the Swedish Body Armor bullet-proof rifle vest. (The caption for the vest begins: ''Let's say you're seeing Jennifer Lopez, and although it would make more sense to stay in, she wants to get dressed and go to a nightclub in Midtown Manhattan.'')</p>
        <p>And on May 8, Blender arrives. Mr. Dennis will publish four issues this year and plans to take it monthly in 2002. He said he was undaunted by a field that already includes The Source, Spin, Vibe and most significantly Rolling Stone.</p>
        <p>''That's what they said about Maxim, wasn't it?'' he said. ''Where are my critics now? Where is David Granger, who said that he didn't think Maxim was connecting with its readers? Where is he now that we have twice the subscribers that he has in total circulation?'' (Mr. Granger is the editor of Esquire magazine, published by Hearst Magazines. Esquire's total circulation is 679,000, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. Maxim's total circulation is 2.4 million, 1.4 million of which is by subscription.)</p>
        <p>''I have never said anything negative about Maxim not connecting with its readers,'' Mr. Granger said. ''And I try to make it a practice not to criticize lunatics.''</p>
        <p>As for GQ magazine and its editor in chief, Art Cooper, Mr. Dennis said he had been amused when Mr. Cooper said that Maxim's readers dribbled on themselves when they read, but then Mr. Dennis said he surveyed his readers and found that almost all GQ readers also read Maxim.</p>
        <p>''So, he is the only editor in chief in history to say that his readers dribble on themselves when they read,'' Mr. Dennis said, his voice booming. ''And where has he been for the last year and a half? Keeping a low profile. Hiding under the parapet.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cooper said: ''I like Felix. He's the only one who invites me to his parties.''</p>
        <p>As for Blender, Mr. Dennis expects to immolate the competition.</p>
        <p>''Jann Wenner, bless his heart,'' Mr. Dennis said. ''But who really wants to read a magazine that is Britney Spears; Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young; and articles about starving Nicaraguan children?''</p>
        <p>Andy Pemberton, Blender's editor -- whom Mr. Dennis hijacked from Q, Blender's rival in England -- said, ''Shouldn't some of those stories be in Newsweek or something?''</p>
        <p>Advertising executives say that there is room for another music magazine, especially if it comes with the Maxim brand behind it. It is no coincidence that the first three issues will have the Maxim logo above the title of the magazine.</p>
        <p>''That gives it a great association for readers,'' said Eric Bethel, a senior director at Optimedia U.S. 'So readers know it will be different, and fresh.''</p>
        <p>Alan Jurmain, executive vice president and managing director for United States media services at Lowe Lintas &amp; Partners Worldwide, said that while he personally disliked Maxim's point of view Mr. Dennis had proved himself before.</p>
        <p>''The category might be softening, but if you can tap into a core of readers, then you can have a success even in this marketplace,'' Mr. Jurmain said. ''He was able to do that in a depressed men's market.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dennis, using a metaphor he turns to often, compared the music magazine industry to a party.</p>
        <p>''In one corner, there's The Source, and well, he looks like he's having a bit of fun, and then there's Spin, which is a bunch of guys standing around in their overcoats saying, 'The music's not pure, the music's not pure,' '' he said. ''And in another corner, there's Rolling Stone, wishing they were in a lap-dancing joint in Haight-Ashbury. It's all so depressing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wenner was nonplussed.  ''Well, in this issue we've got Destiny's Child, the Dalai Lama and Joey Ramone,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''I think Felix has done a terrific job with Maxim,'' Mr. Wenner said. ''I think it surprised everyone, including himself.''</p>
