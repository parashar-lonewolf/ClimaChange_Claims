        <p>WHEN the President wants economic advice, he can always turn to his National Economic Council, the Office of Management and Budget or the Cabinet agencies.

        <p>WHEN the President wants economic advice, he can always turn to his National Economic Council, the Office of Management and Budget or the Cabinet agencies. So why not jettison the Council of Economic Advisers, a 48-year-old symbol of an era when economists had the hubris to believe they could smooth the way to permanent prosperity?</p>
        <p>Such reasoning, spiced with more than a dash of partisanship, apparently explains the House Republicans' inclination to deny funds for the council. But in the view of conservative as well as liberal economists, it represents myopia with a capital M. "It would be a pity to throw away a bargain," argues Martin S. Feldstein, chairman of the council under President Ronald Reagan.</p>
        <p>As Federal agencies go, the council, with a professional staff of 27 and a payroll of less than $4 million, barely rates an asterisk in the trillion-dollar-plus Federal budget. Still, it seemed a plausible enough target for Republicans determined to match cuts in Congressional staff with trims in executive branch operations.</p>
        <p>The Clinton Administration attacked the Republican effort again yesterday as it named a new chairman to the council, Joseph E. Stiglitz, who replaces Laura D'Andrea Tyson. Still, Republicans on a House Appropriations subcommittee voted yesterday to eliminate the council.</p>
        <p>If the Republicans succeed, the Republic will no doubt survive. For one thing, the once-primary role of the council in balancing the risks of recession and inflation has fallen to the keepers of the money supply at the Federal Reserve: The ability to use tax and spending policy to fine-tune economic growth has withered in an era of $200 billion-plus budget deficits. And in any event, the President would still be able to staff the White House with professional economists.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Feldstein, now the head of the National Bureau of Economic Research, thinks much would be lost in downgrading the job. "The council has built a remarkable reputation," he said. "There's just no way you could recruit comparably qualified economists" without the nameplate on the office door.</p>
        <p>Michael J. Boskin, the council chairman under President George Bush, acknowledges that the Cabinet agencies employ some fine economists. But council economists, largely recruited from academia, "bring a fresh look," he argues, "one free of institutional bias." You need outsiders, he suggests, to settle differences between, say, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Energy Department.</p>
        <p>Then, too, even the most ambitious members of the council tend to be economists first and politicians second. For while partisanship sometimes colors their public pronouncements, most council members understand they will not be in government for long. "They are under pressure from the profession to retain their intellectual independence," says James Tobin, a member of the council in the Kennedy White House.</p>
        <p>The benefits of this intellectual independence are not hard to find. In 1961 Mr. Tobin convinced a skeptical President John F. Kennedy of the virtues of tax incentives for business investment. In 1967 Arthur M. Okun tried to persuade President Lyndon B. Johnson to pay for the Vietnam War with a tax increase -- a policy shift that would likely have contained the inflationary fires to come. And in 1982, Mr. Feldstein fought the good fight against slashing taxes before taking on government spending.</p>
        <p>By the same token, council economists, liberal and conservative, have manned the battlements against ill-justified interference with free markets. Council economists under President Reagan held back the tide of trade protectionism. In 1990 the council fought for market-based incentives to cut the cost of containing acid rain. In 1993, Ms. Tyson warned the White House of the striking similarities between the organization of the Clinton health care bureaucracy and the Bulgarian ministry of farm machinery and shoe polish.</p>
        <p>A less appreciated benefit of the council has been to raise the quality of policy economics. A discipline that accords its highest honors to theorists or ideologues and disdains hands-on experience would have much less of value to say, for example, about ways to contain inflation or the pros and cons of deregulating the electric power industry. "Just compare American economists to their European counterparts," suggests Richard L. Schmalensee, a former council member who now teaches at M.I.T.</p>
        <p>The council has been on the endangered species list before. After Mr. Feldstein went public with his critique of voodoo economics, the Reagan White House vowed to rid itself of apostates. But that wound was self-inflicted. Congress is now threatening to deprive future Presidents of easy access to top-rank economic analysis. And, in the words of Mr. Schmalensee, merely "to save the cost of the radio on one stealth bomber."</p>
