        <p>On the Web site for this Minneapolis band, its leader, Craig Minowa, above, lists 36 jobs he has held, including paperboy, U.P.S. truck loader, ''plasma seller'' and gas station attendant. The critical ones come at the end: environmental scientist and musician. Even in this era of biodiesel fuels and degradable eating utensils, Cloud Cult is especially passionate about green music practices. The group started a record label, Earthology, which uses recycled materials in its packaging, asking fans to donate old CD jewel cases to be cleaned and reused. On the road it puts solar panels atop its van and counters its carbon dioxide emissions with wind-power credits and tree plantings. But in its music Cloud Cult is less Al Gore than William Blake. ''The Meaning of 8,'' its fifth album, released this week, is a sprawling, kaleidoscopic invocation of the life force, with songs that veer from jubilation to simmering, prayerful meditation. ''Oh God it's beautiful/Insatiable/The way our chemicals collide,'' Mr. Minowa sings with wonderment, his squeaky, boyish voice resembling that of Wayne Coyne of the Flaming Lips, as an eccentric indie-rock orchestra -- guitar, cello, woodpecker percussion and throbbing, buzzing electronics -- surrounds him like kindly animals in a forest myth. He sounds as enchanted by the natural world as he is dedicated to protecting it. (Tomorrow at 9 p.m. and Sunday at 8 p.m., with Young Galaxy and Exit Clov, at the Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, 212-260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; sold out tomorrow, $12 on Sunday.)</p>
