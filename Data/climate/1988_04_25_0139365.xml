        <p>LEAD: In the view of many Canadians no prime minister in the country's 128-year history has been as consistently pro-American as Brian Mulroney, the Conservative from Quebec who has pledged his political survival on a repudiation of the wariness that has traditionally characterized Canada's attitude toward the United</p>
        <p>In the view of many Canadians no prime minister in the country's 128-year history has been as consistently pro-American as Brian Mulroney, the Conservative from Quebec who has pledged his political survival on a repudiation of the wariness that has traditionally characterized Canada's attitude toward the United States.</p>
        <p>The Mulroney policy culminated six months ago in the signing of a free trade agreement that commits the two Governments to the creation of what would become, after the European Economic Community, the world's largest open market.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, Mr. Mulroney will be in Washington for his fourth annual meeting with President Reagan, which the two leaders will use to celebrate the free trade agreement and to give a push for its approval by the Senate.</p>
        <p>But behind the conviviality will lie a growing sense on Mr. Mulroney's part that Canada's concerns outside trade have not received the attention they deserve at the White House, notably on an issue that is close to the top of Canada's political priorities - acid rain. Sensitive Political Issue</p>
        <p>Mr. Mulroney will address the issue when he speaks to a joint meeting of Congress on Wednesday, and if his remarks to American reporters based in Canada are any guide, the address is likely to have an unstated undercurrent, that on this issue, at least, Mr. Reagan has let Mr. Mulroney down.</p>
        <p>And although he did not say so directly, the Prime Minister's remarks suggested that he is annoyed not to have received greater cooperation from Mr. Reagan on an issue that opinion polls here suggest could damage the Mulroney Government in a general election to be held this year or next.</p>
        <p>At a meeting in the Prime Minister's office here today, Mr. Mulroney, who is 49 years old, reminded the reporters that Mr. Reagan capped his visit to Ottawa last year by committing the Administration to consideration of a treaty on limiting emissions of acid rain across the border.</p>
        <p>Acid rain is the term commonly given to rain or snow that carries destructive chemical compounds that rise into the atmosphere in the form of industrial pollution.</p>
        <p>In subsequent talks United States officials have refused to include in a prospective treaty the mandatory reductions in airborne pollution that Canada seeks, which would parallel a Canadian law requiring industries here to halve atmospheric pollutants by 1994.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mulroney said Mr. Reagan's argument, that more research is needed to prove that acid rain does the damage Canada has claimed, was ''unacceptable'' in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence, including studies that have shown that 50 percent of the acid rain falling on Canada is generated in the United States.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mulroney said the pollution had already killed ''thousands of lakes and rivers and forests'' in Canada, virtually wiping out the maple sugar industry in parts of Quebec and devastating salmon fishing in Nova Scotia. 'Garbage From Above'</p>
        <p>He added: ''If I'm a good neighbor, the United States would be pretty upset with me if I were dumping my garbage in your backyard. That's exactly what's happening, except that this garbage is coming from above.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mulroney made it plain that he will press for independent action on acid rain by Congress. And he suggested that regardless of what the Reagan Administration did, the issue would be forced by the United States Presidential election.</p>
        <p>Calling Vice President George Bush ''a solid environmentalist,'' and saying that environmental concerns are a major factor with the two remaining Democratic contenders, Michael S. Dukakis and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Mr. Mulroney said ''you can bet a dollar to a doughnut'' that acid rain would feature in the campaign.</p>
