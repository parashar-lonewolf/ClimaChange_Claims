        <p>Let's see. There was the smarmy tobacco company public relations specialist, his cigar-chomping boss who dies of his indulgences and an ersatz Marlboro Man who is clearly in the throes of a smoking-related illness. So why did I walk out of ''Thank You for Smoking,'' a satirical comedy based on Christopher Buckley's best-selling novel of the same name, thinking ''Smokers must be loving this film''? And not a single character lit up on-screen.</p>
        <p>Having reported on the tobacco industry for years, I couldn't help noticing how the film made an unambiguous point that Big Tobacco has been preaching for years: Cigarettes may be addictive and unhealthy, but smoking is a matter of choice. And it made the point much more effectively than Big Tobacco usually does.</p>
        <p>I guess that surprised me, given the usual message from Hollywood, which seems more comfortable drawing attention to issues like global warming, world hunger and gay marriage.</p>
        <p>In a key scene, a senator asks the publicist if he would approve his son's taking up smoking. The publicist, who clearly understands the perils of smoking, doesn't answer directly but says that once his son turns 18, it's his choice and he would support the decision.</p>
        <p>There it was: the libertarian defense of smoking, which cigarette companies adopted when they could no longer argue that smoking did not cause horrible health problems. It hasn't always played well in public, among members of Congress or public health advocates. But in the film, satire though it was, it comes through loud and clear.</p>
        <p>I called the world's biggest cigarette company, which owns Philip Morris, to confirm my theory. Dawn Schneider, a real publicist, hesitated to respond, insisting that the film looks dated and poorly reflects the industry with depictions of tobacco executives as highly paid sleazeballs, including her cinematic counterpart, who sleeps with a reporter writing about him, and the company owner, who tries to buy the Marlboro Man's silence about the impact of his smoking.</p>
        <p>She finally agreed to a rather tame response -- '' 'Thank You for Smoking' is a funny satire that takes shots at everyone involved'' -- far tamer than the rhetoric in the film. But Melissa Havard, a consultant to the production who promotes the portrayal of healthy choices in entertainment projects, felt the film's message was mixed. ''To me, it was so obvious, how Big Tobacco manipulates the truth,'' she said ''But it does take a libertarian view on the issue of personal choice and freedom.''</p>
        <p>For final confirmation, I turned to a neutral. ''You might be right,'' my wife said, hearing my thesis. ''But I fell asleep.''</p>
