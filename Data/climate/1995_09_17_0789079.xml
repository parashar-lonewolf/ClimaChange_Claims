        <p>As the deadline approaches for the United States to stop making almost all ozone-destroying refrigerants for domestic use, a private group is estimating that up to 22,000 tons a year, or one-third the amount sold in this country, is smuggled in.</p>
        <p>The Federal Government has no current estimate of the amount of the chemicals, most of them chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's, entering the country illegally. But last year officials said it was about 10,000 tons.</p>
        <p>Under an international agreement intended to limit the damage to Earth's protective ozone layer, the production of CFC's is limited by quotas. The agreement, the Montreal Protocol of 1987, will ban the production of CFC's for most uses in developed countries at the end of this year. It will allow developing countries to continue production for 10 more years.</p>
        <p>The ozone layer in the stratosphere protects people, plants and animals against damaging ultraviolet radiation from the sun. The deterioration of the ozone layer, many scientists say, will increase the incidence of skin cancers and other radiation-related diseases.</p>
        <p>The private group, Ozone Action, said on Thursday that a new pattern of international trade was developing, with the United States exporting more CFC's to developing countries while material produced abroad was illicitly brought into this country.</p>
        <p>Exports from the United States are legal. The producers argue that they are even desirable, because they will forestall countries like India and China from building their own factories, which they might not shut down when their deadline arrives in 2005, said David J. Stirpe, a spokesman for the Alliance for Responsible Atmospheric Policy, an industry group.</p>
        <p>Smuggling CFC's into the United States means that no duties or excise taxes are paid. The illegal shipments could also mean that the total use of CFC's in the United States exceeds the quota set by the Montreal Treaty, but that cannot be determined.</p>
        <p>Ozone Action said CFC's were being smuggled from Russia and other countries in the former Soviet Union to avoid paying charges of almost $6 a pound. The group said that a 30-pound cylinder that costs $70 in Europe is sold in the United States for $242. If 22,000 tons were smuggled in yearly, the group said, the duties and excise taxes lost would amount to more than $200 million.</p>
        <p>Thomas A. Watts-FitzGerald, an Assistant United States Attorney in Miami who has prosecuted several CFC smuggling cases, said in a telephone interview that there was an informal consensus among Government officials last year that about 10,000 tons of CFC's were smuggled into the country every year. He said the quantity had probably declined because of recent prosecutions.</p>
        <p>On Friday, the United States Attorney in Miami, Kendall Coffey, said two dealers in the chemicals, Robert Pennell, 50, of Ronkonkoma, L.I., and Sam Alfano, 63, of Plantation, Fla., had pleaded guilty to importing the material without the required permits. They face a maximum penalty of 10 years in jail and fines of $8.8 million. In another case this year, Jose Prieto of Hialeah, Fla., was convicted of importing CFC's without permits and Paul J. Zborovsky of Cape Coral, Fla., pleaded guilty.</p>
        <p>The material seized from smugglers is given to the Defense Department, which stockpiles it for use in older equipment, said John Passacantando, executive director of Ozone Action. Older equipment cannot use the less damaging chemicals intended to replace CFC's.</p>
        <p>The level of smuggling is very important to the health of the ozone layer, Mr. Passacantando said, as the scientific studies that led to the Montreal Protocol's limits on ozone production "all assumed 100 percent compliance" with the quotas and other limits set for each country.</p>
        <p>Ozone Action's study, by Jim Vallette, a specialist in world trade, was based on conversations with distributors and scrutiny of shipping records around the world. In releasing its report, the group criticized American manufacturers for plans to continue producing CFC's for export to developing countries, which the Montreal accord allows them to do until 2005. If all worldwide production for export stopped, the group said, identifying smuggled CFC's in this country would be simple; everything found in active commerce would be illegal.</p>
        <p>Ozone Action is pushing for an earlier end to the manufacture of CFC's because the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently found record levels of ozone depletion in the Northern Hemisphere. Mr. Passacantando said the solution to that problem would be to phase out CFC's more quickly. "Legally produced CFC's destroy ozone just as efficiently as illegal ones," he said.</p>
        <p>But Congress may be headed in another direction. The House Science Subcommittee on Energy and Environment has scheduled a hearing for Wednesday on whether scientists have overstated the case for damage to the ozone layer by CFC's.  The first witness is scheduled to be Tom DeLay, Republican of Texas, who has introduced legislation that would repeal the section of the Clean Air Act that implements the ban on CFC production for domestic use at the end of the year.</p>
        <p>After CFC's are emitted, they take about three years to reach the stratosphere, where they begin destroying the protective ozone layer, said Dr. Jerry D. Mahlman, one of the Government's chief atmospheric scientists. Dr. Mahlman said the peak of ozone destruction was still on the way. If smuggling is significant, he said, it could delay the expected drop in CFC levels in the stratosphere.</p>
