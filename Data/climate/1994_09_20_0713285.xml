        <p>EVEN supposing that mankind one day stems the population explosion and finds ways to prevent famines, wars, epidemics, the impacts of asteroids and other global catastrophes, Earth will still confront its ultimate doom: a bloated, searing Sun is destined to scorch and melt the planet, wiping it clean of life.</p>
        <p>But a new and highly detailed projection of the Sun's future behavior suggests that the Earth may escape being swallowed and annihilated by the Sun, as some astrophysicists had predicted. The planet will still be melted and purged of life, but it will probably survive as a blob of matter and later as a frozen cinder.</p>
        <p>Taking into account the Sun's present composition, mass and stage of evolution, a team of scientists has improved the precision of previous forecasts, concluding that the Sun will expire in a series of helium flashes that will carry away 40 percent of its mass. They calculate the Earth has a minimum of 1.1 billion years before it becomes uninhabitable, an estimate that does not greatly differ from earlier projections. That would mean that terrestrial life has already used up three-quarters of its allotted span, since life originated at least 3.5 billion years ago.</p>
        <p>The new analysis was prepared by Dr. I. Juliana Sackman of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Arnold I. Boothroyd of the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics at the University of Toronto, incorporating projections by Dr. James F. Kasting, an atmospheric scientist, and Dr. Kenneth Caldeira, a geochemist, both of Pennsylvania State University. Their study for the first time offers precise estimates of the probable effects of a dying Sun on global climate and terrestrial life.</p>
        <p>The Sun is still certain to evolve into a huge, ultrahot "red giant" that will sterilize Earth as efficiently as a blast furnace. In the report, published recently by The Astrophysical Journal, the scientists used their mathematical model to calculate how much of its mass the Sun will lose in the form of solar wind as it undergoes transformation into a red giant, a huge, bright reddish star. Earlier estimates had concluded that in the red giant phase, the Sun's width would increase more than 400 times and fill the center of the solar system almost out to Earth's present orbit. The future Sun would thus swallow up the planets Mercury and Venus, and possibly Earth.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Sackman and her colleagues calculate that by the time the Sun reaches its maximum expansion, its solar wind will probably have carried away roughly 40 percent of its present mass.</p>
        <p>This means that the Sun will exert much less gravitational pull on its planets, all of which will spiral outward. The scientists estimate that Venus will end up 113 million miles from the Sun, much farther out than Earth's present distance of 92 million miles from the Sun. Earth will drift still farther from the Sun, to a distance of 172 million miles.</p>
        <p>Dr. Boothroyd cautioned in an interview, however, that there are still many uncertainties about the rate at which the Sun will lose mass. This rate will decide whether Earth is engulfed by the Sun or merely heated to 2,400 degrees Fahrenheit, at which temperature all its water will have been blasted into space and its surface converted into red-hot molten rock.</p>
        <p>No one suggests that people ought to start worrying about the death throes of the Sun just yet; the Sun has used up only about half of its hydrogen fuel and is still middle-aged.</p>
        <p>"All this terrible stuff takes place so far in the future," said Dr. Boothroyd, "that by that time, if the human race survives its own inventions, it could be capable of doing whatever it wanted to survive. It could go some place else."</p>
        <p>The new home for the human race might be a planet farther from the Sun, or even a planet in another star's system. In principle, he said, future scientists might find a way to shift Earth to a safer orbit farther from the Sun. "It's hard to imagine how that could be done, but a billion years is a lot of time," he said. "If we come up with something, it will probably be much sooner than that. Just think how much we've done in the last few hundred years."</p>
        <p>Dr. Boothroyd is among the astronomers who believe that travel even between stars may be easier than is now believed, and that some way to "cheat Einstein" by traveling faster than light might one day be discovered.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kasting speculated that mankind might find a way to protect Earth from the red-giant Sun, postponing global incineration. "A gigantic Sun shield might do the trick, at least for a while," he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Edward Teller, who played a pivotal role in the development of the hydrogen bomb, has proposed the use of thermonuclear blasts to divert earthbound asteroids from catastrophic impacts. But he scorns speculative schemes for saving terrestrial life from eventual destruction by the Sun.</p>
        <p>As the Sun heats up and expands, he said, "there will be changes, but these will come after so many other changes that I do not find it terribly interesting to think about it."</p>
        <p>"The main point is that probably a significant collision with an asteroid will occur in a couple of hundred years, or, with a smaller probability, a much larger collision," he said. "Therefore it's futile to talk about changes in the very distant future caused by the Sun."</p>
        <p>The Caltech and Toronto groups are only incidentally interested in the fate of the human race; their main concern is in reconstructing details of the Sun's past evolution and future prospects.</p>
        <p>Astronomers are confident that their general ideas about the Sun's future are correct, because the Sun, a G-Class star, belongs to a type that is fairly common. Every stage in the life of this type of star is represented by many examples available in the sky for astronomers to observe and measure.</p>
        <p>Early in this century, two astronomers, Ejnar Hertzsprung, a Dane, and Henry Norris Russell, an American, independently discovered a convenient way to group stars according to their types. They found that when the luminosity, or absolute brightness, of a star is compared with its color, the star usually fits into a simple graphic pattern now called the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram. The pattern is not random. Most stars are restricted to a fairly narrow line on the graph, or to a branch leading away from the line.</p>
        <p>When stars are plotted on this diagram according to their luminosity and color, most of them, including the Sun, fall on the "main sequence" line, and are believed to evolve in a characteristic way.</p>
        <p>With masses about the same as that of the Sun, such stars begin their lives when interstellar hydrogen is drawn together by gravitational attraction into a dense cloud. As more and more hydrogen is drawn into such a cloud, it is compressed by gravitational force to high density, high pressure and high temperature. When a protostar becomes sufficiently hot and dense, thermonuclear fusion ignites, hydrogen begins to burn into helium and the star is born, an event that the Sun experienced 4.5 billion years ago.</p>
        <p>Scientists were astonished to learn several years ago that life began on Earth a geologically short time after the birth of the Sun. As early as 3.5 billion years ago, microorganisms were alive in what is now Australia, and the traces they left in sedimentary rock reveal that they had already evolved many different forms early in Earth's infancy.</p>
        <p>The Sun is a G Class star because of its luminosity and the color of most of its radiation -- visible light centered on the green part of the spectrum, corresponding to a surface temperature of about 6,000 kelvins, or 10,300 degrees Fahrenheit. At present, 4.5 billion years into its "main sequence" phase, the Sun is quietly burning its hydrogen supply and increasing very slightly in luminosity. As a G-class star, it is expected to spend roughly seven billion more years on the main sequence.</p>
        <p>But life on Earth will disappear long before the Sun leaves the main sequence. According to calculations by Dr. Kasting, the Sun will have increased in luminosity by about 10 percent 1.1 billion years from now. That may be enough to initiate rapid water loss. If by then Earth has insufficient cloud cover to protect it from some of the Sun's glare, water will evaporate at a rapid rate, rising as vapor into the stratosphere. At high altitude, solar radiation will split water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen, and the hydrogen will rapidly escape into space.</p>
        <p>But long before then Earth may be experiencing catastrophic distress. One possibility is that about 100 million years from now, rising terrestrial temperatures will speed the weathering of Earth's rocks. This, according to Dr. James E. Lovelock, a British environmental scientist, will remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and convert it into carbonate compounds. By lowering atmospheric carbon dioxide, a greenhouse effect may be reduced, but most of the world's plants, except for corn, sugar and a few others, will be starved of their main nutrient.</p>
        <p>After 11 billion years on the main sequence, the Sun will change course. At first it will cool somewhat, but soon afterward, it will turn into a branch of the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram in which it begins its evolution as a red giant.</p>
        <p>As the hydrogen supply of the Sun is exhausted, a point will come at which the helium in its core, which is produced by hydrogen fusion, will also ignite. By a thermonuclear process, helium atoms will fuse to become carbon and oxygen.</p>
        <p>At first, Dr. Boothroyd said, as helium fusion in its core begins, the Sun will become somewhat less luminous and will slip part of the way back from its status as a red giant. But as the helium in the core is used up, the Sun will resume its climb into red-gianthood, eventually experiencing a half-dozen explosive ignitions of fusion in the outer helium shell of the star. These blasts are expected to blow much of the Sun's mass into space.</p>
        <p>Finally, some 12.4 billion years after the Sun was born, it will undergo the last of its spasmodic helium flashes, and with its thermonuclear fuel practically gone, the dying star will form a planetary nebula, a small, hot stellar remnant surrounded by a large cloud of greenish incandescent gas. Further cooling will leave the Sun as a white dwarf, consisting of matter so dense that one cubic inch would weigh about 10 tons. At the end of the trail, the Sun will become a black dwarf orbited by the cinders of its former planetary system, including the frozen remnant of the long lifeless Earth.</p>
        <p>There Earth will continue to spin, perhaps forever.</p>
        <p>"Fortunately, we still have lots and lots of time," Dr. Boothroyd said.</p>
