        <p>A Global Search for Clues In Twin Terrorist Bombings  American intelligence officers and law-enforcement personnel from around the world streamed into Nairobi to search for clues in the bombing that killed at least 190 people and injured nearly 5,000 there. Officials said their investigation of the attacks on American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania was likely to reach across Africa and the Arabian peninsula to Afghanistan, looking into terrorist networks with bases in at least four countries.</p>

        <p>The U.S. Counsel General in Nairobi, Julian Bartley, has become the 12th American to die in the bomb attack on the American embassy in the Kenyan capital. Officials said problems had led to a delay in identifying the body of the diplomat, whose 20-year-old son, Jay, also died in the blast. Both men were honored at a special ceremony held by Julian Bartley's colleagues.</p>

        <p>U.N.

        <p>Rwanda Linked to Rebellion  Details emerged from the hijacking of a commercial jet last week in Congo that suggest that the country's eastern neighbor, Rwanda, has strongly backed efforts to bring down the Government of President Laurent Kabila. The hijacked plane was used on Tuesday to fly rebel troops from rebel-held areas in the west across Congo to the east, where they opened a second front in the insurrection.</p>

        <p>New Palestinian Cabinet  Palestinian lawmakers voted to approve a new cabinet appointed by Yasir Arafat, after two days of debate in which a loud minority criticized what they called his disdain for the legislature's wishes. The vote concluded a long dispute between Mr. Arafat and the legislature, whose members had urged him for more than a year to make far-reaching changes in order to combat corruption and mismanagement.</p>

        <p>Scientists Ponder Clues On El Nino Link to Diseases  El Nino is giving scientists an opportunity to test longstanding theories that climate changes related to global warming could unleash new outbreaks of diseases. Among the clues they are examining are reports of ''quantitative leaps'' in the incidence of malaria around the world, and a marked increase in cholera cases in Africa and Latin America.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>The warm, wet winter produced by El Nino, combined with an on-and-off wet spring, stimulated an unusually early increase of insects that might spread disease in the New York region. But so far no epidemics have materialized.</p>

        <p>Trouble in the Streets of Reno  Police in riot gear used tear gas and dogs to subdue melees that erupted during Reno's 11th annual Hot August Nights celebration. Some 175,000 people were in Reno for the celebration, a festival of classic automobiles and music from the 1950's, when the trouble erupted. Bottles were thrown at the police and cars were overturned.</p>

        <p>Wyoming's Lingering Mystery  It has been over a year since Amy Wroe Bechtel, a 24-year-old champion runner, vanished outside the quiet mountain town of Lander, Wyo. Police, who have found no trace of her, say the refusal of her husband to take a polygraph test has hindered their investigation.</p>

        <p>Where Napalm Ruffles Few  Months after residents and politicians in Indiana and Illinois succeeded in having a train carrying 22,000 gallons of napalm halted and turned back to California, a Houston company, GNI Group Inc., eased the napalm shipment into Texas in July with only a brief flurry of complaints. ''The people of Houston deal with this kind of stuff all the time,'' said Robin Yocum, manager of media relations for the Battelle Memorial Institute, a Navy contractor that hired GNI Group.</p>

        <p>Skydiving Accidents Kill 2  Two skydivers were killed in separate accidents at the same airport in Kapowsin, Wash., over the weekend. On Sunday, a skydiving student died and his instructor was injured during a tandem jump at Kapowsin Airport. The 23-year-old man and his instructor were harnessed together when their parachute collapsed in the final 200 to 300 feet. The instructor was hospitalized with serious injuries. On Saturday, a 45-year-old instructor was killed and a 27-year-old woman on her first jump was injured when their parachute failed and a reserved chute became tangled.</p>

        <p>Pequot Tribe's Museum Proves the Envy of Its Field  The nation's museum professionals are watching with awe -- and envy -- as the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation prepares to open a $193 million museum on Tuesday with profits from its Foxwoods Resort Casino. The Connecticut museum includes 50-foot diorama with life-size figures like the one above, a machine that spews the scent of camp fires, and an escalator ride through a fiberglass glacier, complete with a 30-degree drop in temperature.</p>

        <p>Bell Atlantic Workers Strike  Bell Atlantic and union officials negotiated through the day to end a strike that 73,000 telephone workers began shortly after midnight, inconveniencing millions of customers from Maine to Virginia. The strike caused immediate delays in reaching directory assistance. But union officials said the disruption would grow today, when most Bell Atlantic workers would have normally reported to work. They said already scheduled repairs and installations would face delays.</p>

        <p>Transit Officials Are Criticized  Transit officials knew that the bus driver involved in a fatal crash on Fifth Avenue last year had a long history of seizures and alcoholism but failed to take him off the road, in violation of state law, a state panel has concluded. The driver, Charles Alston, suffered a seizure moments before the Oct. 2 crash, doctors have said. The board urged New York City Transit and its parent agency, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, to review the medical records of all bus drivers and subway and train operators, a process that was already begun after the crash.</p>

        <p>Fire Kills 4 in North Bergen  Four people died, including an elderly woman lunging for a rescue ladder, after a fire broke out in a 20-story apartment tower in North Bergen, N.J., and burned for more than two hours. The fire started on the fourth floor of the building, which houses mostly elderly people and low-income families. At least a dozen residents, some in their 80's and gasping for air, were taken to hospitals. More than five firefighters were hurt, including one who suffered second-degree burns on the back of his neck and on his ears.</p>

        <p>A Prayer for Abner Louima  Abner Louima bowed his head as he stood in front of the Club Rendez-Vous in Flatbush, Brooklyn, where, on a steamy night exactly a year before, prosecutors say, police officers began a sequence of brutal acts against him. A small gathering that included Mr. Louima's family and friends and the parents of people who had died while in police custody were led in prayer by the Rev. Al Sharpton. ''A year ago, he was alone.'' Mr Sharpton said. ''Today, the whole city stands with him.''</p>
