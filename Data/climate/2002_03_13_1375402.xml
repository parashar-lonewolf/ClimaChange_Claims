        <p>DEBATE global warming all you like, but man's effects on the environment are so obvious here you can almost taste them. Too bad there isn't enough water to wash them down.</p>
        <p>The village of Ledgewood is the seat of Roxbury Township, founded in 1740. The town seal shows a canoe by a tepee on a riverbank. It's due for an update. A Jeep in front of a McMansion would do fine. Or something starker. Like a divining rod.</p>
        <p>That's what it may come to for this outpost on the next frontier of development, where the steady march of sprawl is grinding to a halt because the wells have run dry.</p>
        <p>The water restrictions that Gov. James E. McGreevey imposed on Monday were already in place here. In fact, Roxbury has gone much further, and not just because of the drought. In January, the township declared a five-month moratorium on building permits for projects needing municipal water.</p>
        <p>''If they come up with their own water supply, they're certainly entitled to build,'' Mayor Jim Rilee said of the developers who have been affected. ''But the township has no water to supply.''</p>
        <p>The odd thing is that Roxbury doesn't look like it has been overbuilt. Sure, it has its strip-mall steppes, its clear-cut hillsides with houses that look as if they were designed by architects who didn't know how to erase. One, in a fairly recent subdivision carved out of Mooney Mountain, had six cars and S.U.V.'s in the driveway yesterday at noon. And it's a fair bet no one was home.</p>
        <p>But there are plenty of woods, including 165 leftover acres on Mooney Mountain that are being preserved with $5.1 million in open-space grants. And an old dynamite-production plant, surrounded by hundreds of acres of wooded hillsides, has thus far avoided a paving-over.</p>
        <p>Still, the facts remain: the population has risen 16 percent in the past decade, according to census data, and the water table, measured in a federal test well, has dropped 10 feet.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Tittel, director of the Sierra Club's New Jersey chapter, said the problem was that Roxbury's rolling terrain -- many hillsides were once mined for iron ore -- simply doesn't have the abundance of groundwater needed to sustain a density of development more appropriate to the lowlands.</p>
        <p>''What's happening in Roxbury is a perfect example of not planning your growth based on the availability of water,'' he said. ''They've got wells going like straws into the ground. And there are so many straws that they've sucked it dry.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tittel said Roxbury's water supply was probably enough to supply one house for every 10 or 15 acres. But of 12 projects affected by the moratorium, a typical one calls for 190 homes of 3,000 square feet each -- ''standard tract houses,'' in the words of the township manager, Christopher Raths -- on lots that are a third of an acre.</p>
        <p>Better late than never, Roxbury is coming out with a ''water master plan'' in a couple of weeks, Mayor Rilee said. But the options, at this stage, are grim. The town can dig more wells, or it can buy more water from outside suppliers, like the county utilities authority.</p>
        <p>MR. RATHS, however, likened digging more wells to wildcatting for oil. ''You never know,'' he said, if there will be water where you dig, or how much. It's also terribly costly, he said. The township will have to decide how much developers who are heightening the demand for water should pay to meet it.</p>
        <p>Those rising costs, on top of the current shortages, are giving anti-development forces a populist punch. ''We hear it all the time,'' Mayor Rilee said. ''I get yelled at because of all the developments going up.''</p>
        <p>Roxbury has already tried to buy more water from the county, meanwhile, but any expansion of the supply to Roxbury would come at a cost to other towns, or perhaps to the source aquifers themselves, and would require the approval of state regulators suddenly sensitized to water scarcity.</p>
        <p>In effect, Roxbury has reached maturity before its time. And environmentalists say the same fate -- one way or another, drought or no drought -- lies in the near future for much of New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tittel, who supported Mr. McGreevey last year, observed that the new governor had inherited both the worst budget crisis and the worst drought in the state in decades.</p>
        <p>''It's like he has a dark cloud hanging over him,'' Mr. Tittel said.</p>
        <p>If only it were a rain cloud.</p>
