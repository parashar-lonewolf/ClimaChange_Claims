        <p>LEAD: The agreement will probably not show results in the delegates' lifetimes, but there were congratulations all around when an international conference in Montreal last week produced an accord to protect the earth's ozone layer. The agreement requires the limitation and eventual reduction of chlorofluorcarbons and other chemicals that destroy ozone in the upper atmosphere, threatening radiation damage to the ecosphere and increased skin cancer among humans.</p>

        <p>The agreement will probably not show results in the delegates' lifetimes, but there were congratulations all around when an international conference in Montreal last week produced an accord to protect the earth's ozone layer. The agreement requires the limitation and eventual reduction of chlorofluorcarbons and other chemicals that destroy ozone in the upper atmosphere, threatening radiation damage to the ecosphere and increased skin cancer among humans.</p>
        <p>The protocol was signed by 24 nations, including the United States, and by the European Community. Delegates from many other nations, including the Soviet Union, declared support for the pact but did not have their governments' authorization to sign it in Montreal. To take effect, it must be ratified by nations representing two-thirds of the global use of the chemicals, which is not expected to present a problem.</p>
        <p>The conference came more than a decade after the first warnings of a threat to the ozone layer, which filters harmful solar radiation; since then, a drastic thinning of the ozone layer over Antarctica has been noted. Scientists predicted that even with an immediate ban on chlorofluorocarbons, ozone depletion would proceed for decades because of the tons of CFC gases already released into the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>CFC's are used in aerosol sprays, refrigerants, solvents and foam insulation and packaging. The United States, Canada and the Scandinavian countries banned CFC's in aerosol propellants in the 1970's.</p>
