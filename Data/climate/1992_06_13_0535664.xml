        <p>Environment ministers at the Earth Summit finally wrapped up a set of voluntary principles aimed at preserving the world's dwindling forests, a goal that was a United States priority at the conference, and were working feverishly tonight on a global cleanup plan.</p>
        <p>The Administration did not obtain a commitment to turn the forest preservation principles into a binding international convention, but the document, approved early today, leaves open the possibility of a new forest treaty in the future.</p>
        <p>The document describes the forest principles as an "authoritative" statement insuring that all countries have a right to use their forests to advance their economic development, but that they should do so only "on a sustainable basis."</p>
        <p>The principles thus chart a tortuous middle course between the desire of countries with tropical forests, like Malaysia, India and Brazil, to assert theirsovereignty over a valuable natural resource and the wish of most Northern countries to define forests as a global asset.</p>
        <p>William K. Reilly, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, expressed some disappointment with the outcome today, saying the principles were "not as strong as we would have liked."</p>
        <p>But some other Western officials said the principles went further than they had expected at the start of the summit talks.</p>
        <p>"They don't close off the possibility of a convention, and closing it off was the objective of Malaysia," an official said.</p>
        <p>It was also suggested that the proposed new Sustainable Development Commission, which will monitor compliance with commitments made at the Earth Summit, could call for negotiations on a binding treaty when it reviews the way the world's forests are being managed.</p>
        <p>"The talk around the ministers' meeting last night, though it couldn't be said in there, was that this should be a priority for the Commission on Sustainable Development," another Western official said.</p>
        <p>In negotiations, many developing countries said the industrial world only values tropical forests for the carbon dioxide they absorb because this reduces the sacrifices the North must make to avert global warming.</p>
        <p>The principles call for "environmentally sound national guidelines" for development and recognize that while forests meet many economic, social and cultural needs, they also act as "carbon sinks and reservoirs" that slow climate change.</p>
        <p>These same representatives of the world's rich and poor countries worked tonight to resolve outstanding issues over aid and atmospheric pollution that are blocking completion of the new global cleanup plan, known as Agenda 21, which the summit hopes to endorse on Sunday. Vows to Do More</p>
        <p>To encourage developing countries to compromise on these issues, the United States, Canada, Germany and the 12 European Community countries, speaking as a bloc, all pledged to do more to help poorer nations safeguard the environment.</p>
        <p>But it was impossible to judge immediately how much new money they were really offering.</p>
        <p>Developing countries want the Western industrialized nations to make good by the year 2000 on a promise they made more than 20 years ago to raise development aid to 0.7 percent of their economic output.</p>
        <p>None of the Western heads of state or government who addressed the summit today would make such a promise. But Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany said he wanted to reach that target "as soon as possible," and in the meantime committed his Government to an unspecified "increase in official development aid."</p>
        <p>President Bush and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada both said they would increase the amount of aid to help poorer countries protect their ecological systems. But it was unclear whether this involved new money or reapportioning existing aid budgets. Europeans Pledge $4 Billion</p>
        <p>Prime Minister John Major of Britain made no mention of development aid when he addressed the summit. But the 12 European Community countries, as expected, said they would give $4 billion, including some "new and additional resources," to finance key aspects of Agenda 21, describing this as "an initial contribution."</p>
        <p>By making these offers, Western leaders say they are seeking to convince developing countries that they mean to help them cope with the extra bills they face for making development environmentally sustainable and thus encourage them to accept the goals set in Agenda 21.</p>
        <p>But negotiators are still trying to settle on wording that encourages aid donors to reach the 0.7 percent target by the end of this century without actually committing them to do so.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia continues to oppose passages in Agenda 21 encouraging countries to use "economic measures" to promote energy savings, fearing that this will lead to the introduction of new carbon fuel taxes that would reduce the world's appetite for oil.</p>
