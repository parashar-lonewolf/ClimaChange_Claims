        <p>August is a slow time for news, and never more than this year, with President Bush giving himself the entire month off. Some people in the press seem to be following his lead. Tom Brokaw started his holiday on June 22, saying  ''You have a wonderful summer,'' and isn't expected back until after Labor Day. Dan Rather, meanwhile, advised viewers that discussing the stem cell controversy ''requires such depth into the complexities'' that viewers who wanted to know about it should buy a newspaper. The rest of the month promises some equally summery reporting:</p>
        <p>Aug. 20 -- Readers following Rather's advice are disappointed to discover that The Washington Post, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal all share a common headline: ''Stem Cells? Never heard of 'em. Try the Web.''</p>

        <p>August is a slow time for news, and never more than this year, with President Bush giving himself the entire month off. Some people in the press seem to be following his lead. Tom Brokaw started his holiday on June 22, saying  ''You have a wonderful summer,'' and isn't expected back until after Labor Day. Dan Rather, meanwhile, advised viewers that discussing the stem cell controversy ''requires such depth into the complexities'' that viewers who wanted to know about it should buy a newspaper. The rest of the month promises some equally summery reporting:</p>
        <p>Aug. 20 -- Readers following Rather's advice are disappointed to discover that The Washington Post, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal all share a common headline: ''Stem Cells? Never heard of 'em. Try the Web.''</p>
        <p>Aug. 21 -- Peter Jennings begins his broadcast by saying: ''The top story tonight -- the Pentagon prepares for cutbacks. Honestly, I don't know anything about the military. You know who does? Wolf Blitzer!'' Jennings then hurries off to Martha's Vineyard.</p>
        <p>Aug. 22 -- Morley Safer and Mike Wallace spend an entire ''60 Minutes'' episode sitting in chairs quietly napping. CBS research reveals viewers prefer this to Andy Rooney.</p>
        <p>Aug. 23 -- An angry Dan Rather hurls quarters at the camera while screaming, ''I thought I told you people to go buy a newspaper!''</p>
        <p>Aug. 24 -- Viewers are startled to see Katie Couric in a bathrobe sleeping on the ''Today Show'' desk. The normally perky Couric glares at the camera and hisses, ''Do you people have any idea what time it is?''</p>
        <p>Aug. 25 -- ABC lands the interview of the summer when Gary Condit sits down with Barbara Walters. Oddly, her lone question to the mysterious congressman is: ''Can you do the news for me? Just read whatever's on that teleprompter.''</p>
        <p>Aug. 27 -- Viewers notice Brit Hume's descriptions of the president's activities are suspiciously similar to whatever happened that week on ''The West Wing.''</p>
        <p>Aug. 28 -- With most of the staff on vacation, USA Today tries to lighten the workload by renaming itself ''North Dakota Today.''</p>
        <p>Aug. 29 -- After taking a stand against sensationalism by not covering the Gary Condit story, Dan Rather raises eyebrows by announcing he's also not going to do any ''cheap'' stories this month on the fighting in Macedonia, global warming, the health care controversy or anything involving the Middle East. Rather then picks up a surfboard and tells viewers, ''Later, dudes.''</p>
