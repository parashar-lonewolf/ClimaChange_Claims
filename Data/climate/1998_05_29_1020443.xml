        <p>In a new permanent exhibition off the rotunda, the American Museum of Natural History has a surprise in store for visitors accustomed to its displays of South Sea cultures, vertebrate evolution and, of course, the dinosaurs of awesome splendor. No single category of life, not birds or mammals or reptiles, animates this show. No geographic boundaries or epochs of time restrict its scope.</p>
        <p>Instead, the unifying theme of the exhibition  extends beyond any such confines to embrace the entire concept of biodiversity, the idea that all living things, in all their global variety, are interdependent. It is a theme freighted with sobering implications for the future of life on earth, especially with the rising toll of species extinctions posing a grave threat to biodiversity.</p>
        <p>''This is the museum's first truly interdisciplinary hall,'' Ellen V. Futter, the institution's president, said at a preview of the Hall of Biodiversity, which opens tomorrow. ''This is the museum's first issues hall.''</p>
        <p>Arrayed on one long wall at the exhibition are more than 1,500 specimens and models depicting the sweep of life, from microbes to plants, insects and large animals. These are, in the words of the curators, the players in the three-and-a-half-billion-year game of life. The center of the hall is filled with an impressive diorama of a rain forest, an example of the richest and most fragile of the world's nine distinct ecosystems. Beyond that is the most explicitly issue-oriented part of the hall. Here the exhibits, along with videos and computer stations, illustrate the crisis in biodiversity and what can be done about it.</p>
        <p>Walking through the Hall of Biodiversity, its chief curator, Dr. Niles Eldredge, said that four questions inspired the exhibition and shaped its organization: What is biodiversity? Why should we care? What are we doing to the species? And what can we do about all this?</p>
        <p>''We want people to say, 'My goodness, life is beautiful, and you mean it's under dire threat?' '' he said.</p>
        <p>Museum officials cite ample evidence for the urgency of the issues raised by the threat to life's diversity. In a recent survey, 7 out of 10  biologists called this the most pressing environmental issue of our time, more so than global warming or depletion of the ozone layer in the atmosphere. Among the 10 million to 13 million species living today, scientists estimate, 30,000 are becoming extinct each year -- three species an hour lost forever.</p>
        <p>Under the pressure of expanding human population and overexploitation of natural resources, the rate of species loss is expected to accelerate. The cumulative effect in the next century could be a mass extinction on a scale not seen since the great dying of dinosaurs and most marine life 65 million years ago. That was one of five great extinctions revealed in the fossil record. Like many scientists, the curators say the world is already in the midst of its sixth extinction, one that is proceeding at an alarming pace. Some scientists even predict the extinction of as many as half of the species on earth in the next 30 years.</p>
        <p>As serious as the matter may be, the challenge for the curators has been to produce an engaging medium for conveying the provocative message. They have relied on some traditional techniques, mixing specimens, artifacts and text to describe the diversity of life. They have sought to immerse visitors in the sights, sounds and smells of life by applying electronic technology to the familiar diorama, a form of habitat display pioneered decades ago by the museum and now freshened with considerable realism, including motion.</p>
        <p>They also have in place the means to keep the exhibition up to date with an electronic ''Bio-Bulletin,'' a video showing the effects on biodiversity from current events like fires in Indonesia, deforestation and El Nino.</p>
        <p>How well the curators have succeeded may depend on how much time one invests in the new hall.</p>
        <p>One should enter the exhibition from the rotunda, stopping to catch a short introductory video narrated by Tom Brokaw. Next, to the right, begins the ''Spectrum of Life,'' a 100-foot-long wall mounted with specimens encompassing 28 living groups and illustrating the variety of life over time. One could spend hours examining the specimens and looking and listening at the informative interactive computer stations.</p>
        <p>Sometimes the earnest doses of facts and figures may light up some eyes but, after a while, may bring a glaze to others. One label reads: ''A total of 639 square meters of root surface area has been measured from a single rye plant in six liters of soil.''</p>
        <p>If time is short, one should at least take a moment and stand back from the wall.</p>
        <p>Look left to the most elemental organisms, bacteria and pond scum, then to the ceiling on the far right, where a model of a giant squid hangs from the ceiling. Somewhere in between, pause to wonder at the sight of a host of butterflies climbing in flight to the ceiling, it seems, each one intricately distinct in design and color. This is a lasting snapshot of biodiversity.</p>
        <p>The only specimen in the entire hall that is already extinct is a dodo, represented by a skeleton. But such endangered species as the golden-capped fruit bat, the Siberian tiger, the giant panda and the rhinoceros iguana are there as reminders of the gloomy prospects for many creatures.</p>
        <p>The most popular part of the exhibition may turn out to be the rain forest diorama in the center of the hall. This is a huge re-creation of the Dzanga-Sangha rain forest in the Central African Republic, based on recent research by a museum expedition led by Dr. Joel Cracraft, a curator of ornithology, and J. Willard Whitson, associate director of exhibitions.</p>
        <p>Through high-resolution imagery, video, sound and lighting effects, one can look into the dense foliage and see the motion of life at different times of day. The diorama has more than 160 species of flora and fauna, including an orange-breasted forest robin that was discovered by the expedition and will soon be given a formal scientific name and description. Working with leaf casts, designers fabricated some 500,000 leaves of different sizes and shapes. Water flows through the vegetation; model creatures scamper up tree trunks; the air smells of jungle, and deep in the background, elephants and other large creatures appear in lifelike motion.</p>
        <p>The diorama depicts the rain forest not only at different times of day but also in three different states: pristine, altered by natural forces and degraded by human intervention, like farming, mining and logging. Dr. Eldredge said this represented a fundamental departure from traditional exhibitions at the museum. ''Rather than depicting nature solely in its pristine state,'' he said, ''this exhibition tells the story of humanity's transformation of the globe and the consequences of that transformation.''</p>
        <p>Which brings one to the last section of the Hall of Biodiversity, where a sign declares, ''The future of life is in our hands.'' Along the wall are texts, graphics and videos explaining how life is being affected by agriculture and urbanization, overexploitation of resources and global environmental change. In other alcoves, solutions are proposed through protection and restoration of habitats, scientific research, improved management of resources and new laws and regulations.</p>
        <p>At one display, there is a reminder of unfinished business, as well as the difficulty of getting people to agree on courses of action to halt the loss of diversity. A panel refers to the signing of a convention to conserve biodiversity at the Earth Summit in Brazil in 1992, and points out that as of early 1998, 23 countries, including the United States, had not ratified the agreement.</p>
        <p>''I don't think there's a more passionate, powerful statement anywhere else about the value of biodiversity and the threats to it,'' said Dr. Michael J. Novacek, the museum's senior vice president and provost.</p>
        <p>The Hall of Biodiversity is also seen as a harbinger of exhibitions to come. More are expected to reflect new research by museum scientists. Since 1993, for example, the museum's Center for Biodiversity and Conservation, headed by Dr. Francesca Grifo, has concentrated on scientific research aimed at identifying and understanding species losses as a basis for making complex political and economic decisions.</p>
        <p>The focus will also be on exhibitions reflecting, as Ms. Futter said, ''our sense of responsibility to bring major topics of our time to the public'' and to demystify science and make it more comprehensible to general audiences. The museum could not have started with a more vital and challenging subject than biodiversity.</p>
