        <p>SINCE the last century, scientists have puzzled over an essential problem of human physiology: how the body regulates the flow of blood in individual tissues. The puzzle is not just intellectual, because the solution would have profound implications for the treatment of heart attacks, strokes and myriad diseases of blood and blood pressure and for the development of effective blood substitutes.</p>
        <p>The classic view of local blood-flow changes, described in all medical textbooks, is that the smooth muscles inside arterial walls open or narrow the arteries, responding to some signal within those walls. Blood is depicted as a passive fluid, subject to the more active muscles.</p>
        <p>But a new idea that has caught the attention of medical researchers -- unproven until other scientists confirm it --  suggests that blood is far more active. It lays the main responsibility for the local control of blood flow to hemoglobin, a familiar molecule long known as the component of blood that ferries oxygen to tissues throughout the body.</p>
        <p>The new research suggests that when tissue oxygen levels are low, hemoglobin causes arteries in that area to open wider so more blood can rush in. When oxygen levels are high, hemoglobin narrows the arteries, slowing the flow of blood.</p>
        <p>The lead author of the new report, published in the June 27 issue of the journal Science, is Dr. Jonathan S. Stamler, a professor of medicine at the Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C.  ''Think of it this way,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''Hemoglobin's job in life is to deliver oxygen. If this was your assigned task, wouldn't you want to exert some control?''</p>
        <p>Dr. Steven Gross, an associate professor of pharmacology at Cornell Medical College in New York City, said the new idea ''remains to be proven correct.'' But he said: ''If it's not correct, nature should have invented it that way. It makes too much sense. It feels too right to be wrong.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Colin Rose, an associate professor of medicine at McGill University in Montreal, said: ''It looks like Dr. Stamler has discovered the mechanism of autoregulation of blood flow, a problem that has lured many investigators. I would like to believe it's true because it is so beautifully simple.''</p>
        <p>Evidence for a new function for hemoglobin was unexpected, said Dr. Alan Schechter, chief of the laboratory of chemical biology at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in Bethesda, Md. ''We thought we knew everything there was to know about hemoglobin,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The mechanism suggested for hemoglobin would be part of the homeostatic control system. Homeostatic control mechanisms help the body maintain a constant internal environment despite external changes. For example, when body temperature rises, skin produces sweat, which takes away excess heat as it evaporates. When the body takes in sugar, the pancreas releases insulin to help blood glucose move into cells. The notion that a new homeostatic mechanism could be found in 1997 is really quite surprising, Dr. Schechter said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Stamler and others say the new view of hemoglobin stems from a recent discovery that a simple gas called nitric oxide, or NO, is involved in sending or receiving signals throughout the body. ''It does everything, everywhere,'' Dr. Stamler said. ''You cannot name a major cellular response or physiological effect in which NO is not implicated today. It's involved in complex behavioral changes in the brain, airway relaxation, beating of the heart, dilation of blood vessels, regulation of intestinal movements, function of blood cells, the immune system, erectile function, even how digits and arms move.''</p>
        <p>Last year, in the journal Nature, Dr. Stamler and his colleagues reported that there were three major gases in the respiratory cycle: oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitric oxide. They showed that a special form of nitric oxide, called S-nitrosohemoglobin, or SNO, was tucked away inside the hemoglobin protein and that SNO could pop on or off with ease.</p>
        <p>That raised the question why all that nitric oxide was being shipped throughout the bloodstream. What is its function within hemoglobin?</p>
        <p>The classic view of blood is that it simply delivers oxygen to tissues and carries carbon dioxide away, Dr. Stamler said. After leaving the heart, it flows into very large arteries, which fan out into huge networks of smaller and smaller arteries, or arterioles, that eventually reach individual organs and tissues.</p>
        <p>Systems of small arteries, measuring 10 to 200 microns across (a micron is about one-hundredth the thickness of a human hair), control blood flow into organs like the liver, kidney and brain. These arteries have smooth muscles that allow them to contract or expand, Dr. Stamler said, and that affects the amount of blood actually flowing into any tissue system.</p>
        <p>Once past these small arteries, blood flows into even tinier capillaries, which are passive conduits for dropping off oxygen and picking up carbon dioxide from hard-working tissues. Near the capillaries are tiny veins, called venules, that come together into progressively larger veins as the blood makes it way back to the lungs, where it drops off carbon dioxide and picks up a fresh supply of oxygen.</p>
        <p>Earlier work has shown that hemoglobin assumes two shapes during its work. When it carries a full load of oxygen, it is one conformation (call it shape A). After it drops oxygen, it changes into a second shape (B) and picks up carbon dioxide. As hemoglobin makes its way through the body, it constantly flips back and forth between the two shapes, depending on the oxygen supply. And it was already known that nitric oxide can be produced in the walls lining small arteries and that this could have an effect on their diameter. Increased amounts of NO make arteries grow wider.</p>
        <p>But the work of Dr. Stamler and his colleagues addressed the remaining mysteries about the blood system, he said, especially the problem of the missing oxygen. A hemoglobin molecule leaving the left side of the heart carries four oxygen molecules. It travels to the small arteries, where it often drops two oxygens before making its way into a capillary. In the capillary, it drops one more oxygen. But when a hemoglobin molecule reaches the lungs, it often carries two or three oxygens -- not what simple subtraction would indicate.</p>
        <p>How could this be?</p>
        <p>By taking the first actual measurements of NO bound to hemoglobin in anesthetized, living animals, an extremely difficult feat, Dr. Stamler has come up with a new model of the circulatory system that solved this mystery and assigned the role of  local control of blood flow to hemoglobin.</p>
        <p>In his model, a hemoglobin molecule, carried in a red blood cell, enters the lungs carrying two or three molecules of oxygen but is still in its deoxygenated shape, B. In the lungs, it encounters fresh air and picks up more oxygen, then immediately changes into shape A. At the same time, a tiny amount of nitric oxide is picked up and tucked away tightly inside the hemoglobin as SNO, which cannot be gobbled up by the molecule's iron.</p>
        <p>The oxygen-rich hemoglobin travels to the heart and is pumped out into the body to feed working tissues. In the small arteries, the model says, the hemoglobin senses how much oxygen is present in nearby tissue. If the oxygen level is low, the hemoglobin responds by changing its shape from A to B. When it changes shape,  two oxygens are released and SNO pops off the hemoglobin molecule and signals the artery muscles to widen the vessel. The end result is greater blood flow, which means more oxygen for the tissues.</p>
        <p>Nitric oxide from hemoglobin helps determine vascular tone, Dr. Stamler said. Some of the gas may be produced locally in arterial walls, but he suspects that it plays a secondary role. Other factors that affect vascular tone, like hormones and the sympathetic nervous system, operate on a bodywide scale.</p>
        <p>With two oxygens gone, hemoglobin next enters the capillaries, where it typically drops one more oxygen, which is used to sustain tissues.  When hemoglobin exits from the capillary, Dr. Stamler said, it makes a U-turn into one of the tiny veins that lie smack up against the small arteries. There, he said, it picks up one or two of the extra oxygen molecules  that were dropped when the hemoglobin changed its shape, and it picks up carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>If oxygen levels in the small arteries are high, Dr. Stamler said, the hemoglobin does not change shape. It does not release SNO, and the blood vessel does not widen. The vessel actually contracts, he said, because the iron in hemoglobin tends to mop up any free nitric oxide in vessel walls, and less oxygen is made available to the tissues.</p>
        <p>So, the model says, hemoglobin is in tight control of blood flow, deciding how much or how little oxygen to deliver, depending on the demand at any one instant, Dr. Stamler said.</p>
        <p>''The system makes sense because you want blood flow to be regulated at the level of each tissue,'' he said.  ''When you run, you need to deliver more blood to muscles, and when you stop running, you want to slow down blood flow. When you think hard, your brain requires more oxygen, and when you eat, your body sends blood to the stomach to aid digestion. Each tissue has its own sets of blood-flow requirements. Hemoglobin does the job.''</p>
        <p>It is too soon to predict the implications of the new findings for medical practice, said Dr. David P. Hajjar, a professor of biochemistry and pharmacology at Cornell Medical Center. But it is known that oxygen deficiency is a major contributor to many diseases in every organ system. Atherosclerosis, heart attacks, stroke, septic shock and sickle cell disease might be treated by giving patients a form of hemoglobin that is enriched with SNO. The goal would be to restore normal blood flow to tissues by using a smart molecule like hemoglobin.</p>
        <p>Dr. Stamler and Duke University have applied for patents on the use of SNO-hemoglobin as a drug. He said that one of the earliest uses might be in blood substitutes. Drug companies have spent almost a billion dollars looking for ways to develop an oxygen-delivery system for artificial blood, he said; most of the work has focused on purifying naked hemoglobin from cows or bacteria. Many of these blood substitutes have caused high blood pressure, he said, but if the companies simply added SNO to the hemoglobin, the substitute blood might work.</p>
