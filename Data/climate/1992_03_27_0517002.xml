        <p>Polls now show that Americans have more confidence in Democrats than in President Bush on every issue except foreign policy. A solid majority still sees him as a real pro on world affairs.</p>
        <p>Which means Mr. Bush will try to capitalize on this advantage in the campaign. Which means the Democratic contender has no choice but to counter that the old pro is overrated.</p>
        <p>Which led me to consult with the best minds -- Republicans, Democrats, liberals and conservatives -- to prepare this Bush report card.</p>
        <p>The Old Soviet Union: Very slow to pick up on Mikhail Gorbachev's determination to reform the old empire. But when he got the picture, did a solid job of building up Gorby's stature and prodding him on. Then slow again to realize time to switch to Boris Yeltsin, though no harm done.</p>
        <p>Grade: B+</p>
        <p>The Ex-Soviet Republics: Criticized justly for not being fast enough to aid democracy and capitalism in the new states. And certainly has not done well at organizing Western aid efforts. But sensible in not trying to do more than possible with a chaotic situation. Has focused on the right priority -- trying to insure that nuclear weapons don't fall into the wrong hands.</p>
        <p>Grade: B</p>
        <p>Prewar Iraq: Overwhelming evidence now that he tried to please and appease Saddam Hussein long after the dictator had showed his true, evil colors. Actively kept helping Saddam with credits and intelligence up to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Opposed legislators who wanted to get tough, though most experts don't look good in hindsight either.</p>
        <p>Grade: F</p>
        <p>The War Against Iraq: After two weeks of confusion, a masterful job.</p>
        <p>Grade: A</p>
        <p>Postwar Iraq: Inexplicably foolish about not letting the war continue for another 48 hours to mop up Iraq's military capability. But right not to go on to Baghdad and take on that headache. Inexcusably didn't prevent Iraqi air power from devastating Kurds and Shiites. Has managed the situation since then intelligently.</p>
        <p>Grade: C+/B-</p>
        <p>Mideast: Very skillful engineering of the first real Arab-Israeli peace talks. Nurtured ties with Arabs well. Was right to get tough with Israel about settlements in the occupied territories, but bullheadedly wrong in not sustaining sanctity of the overall American-Israeli democratic alliance. Grade: B</p>
        <p>China: Terrible on human rights and too protective of Chinese dictators. But doing a delicate balancing act in a difficult situation where the U.S. needs Chinese restraint in selling arms and nuclear know-how.</p>
        <p>Grade: C+/B-</p>
        <p>German Reunification and NATO: Slow to recognize change, but then deft in handling a major geopolitical transformation. Properly attentive to keeping Germany in the Western alliance and the U.S. in Europe militarily.</p>
        <p>Grade: A-</p>
        <p>Japan: Good instincts on trade and Japanese sensibilities, except for the horribly conceived recent visit with Big Three auto makers. Lacks strategy.</p>
        <p>Grade: B-</p>
        <p>Panama: Waged a questionable war to capture Manuel Noriega, then let that sad country once again become a drug haven and money-laundering center.</p>
        <p>Grade: F</p>
        <p>Free Trade: Good anti-protectionist rhetoric on GATT and decent leadership on opening up trade in North America. But spends far too little time on these critical and difficult matters.</p>
        <p>Grade: B-/C+</p>
        <p>New Agenda Issues: Depressingly inattentive and insensitive here. Doesn't seem to realize that foreign economic policy is now at the center of world politics. No sense of the need to adapt foreign policy and machinery of government accordingly. Inexcusably dragging his feet on U.N. efforts to stem global warming and other environmental threats. Still spending too much on interdiction of drugs rather than treatment at home. Has done little to promote energy security. Not enough backing for U.N. peacekeeping operations, but better than Congress.</p>
        <p>Grade: D</p>
        <p>Over All: Good instincts and judgment about the familiar, old cold war problems. Particularly solid at managing crises that flow from those relationships. But without much sense of overarching strategy and sometimes blind to the sea changes under way. Much more attuned to the passing era of balance-of-power politics than to the coming world where policies need to transcend national boundaries and perspectives.</p>
        <p>Final grade: B- and sinking.</p>
