        <p>If Congress cranks up the Pentagon's budget as much as President Bush would like, the United States will soon be spending more on defense than all the other countries of the world combined. That is just one measure of America's armed might -- and a global imbalance of power the likes of which has probably not been seen since the height of the Roman empire. While the United States is used to regarding itself as a global power, and its status as the sole superpower has steadily grown since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the overwhelming disparity is still a big change. So is the country's willingness to exercise its power in the wake of Sept. 11. Before President Bush decides where next to take the war against terrorism, he and the American people ought to pause for a moment to think about how we intend to behave in this new and awesome role.</p>
        <p>The advantages of being an unchallengeable military superpower are obvious. The opponents will not always be as easily routed as the Taliban and Al Qaeda forces in Afghanistan, and some conflicts are certain to produce many more casualties on all sides, but American might dwarfs the capacity of almost any foe we may face in the war against terrorism. And we have learned that there are instances when the use of force is necessary.  Sept. 11 taught us what harm can come from complacency and inaction in the face of cold-blooded enemies determined to destroy the United States.</p>

        <p>If Congress cranks up the Pentagon's budget as much as President Bush would like, the United States will soon be spending more on defense than all the other countries of the world combined. That is just one measure of America's armed might -- and a global imbalance of power the likes of which has probably not been seen since the height of the Roman empire. While the United States is used to regarding itself as a global power, and its status as the sole superpower has steadily grown since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the overwhelming disparity is still a big change. So is the country's willingness to exercise its power in the wake of Sept. 11. Before President Bush decides where next to take the war against terrorism, he and the American people ought to pause for a moment to think about how we intend to behave in this new and awesome role.</p>
        <p>The advantages of being an unchallengeable military superpower are obvious. The opponents will not always be as easily routed as the Taliban and Al Qaeda forces in Afghanistan, and some conflicts are certain to produce many more casualties on all sides, but American might dwarfs the capacity of almost any foe we may face in the war against terrorism. And we have learned that there are instances when the use of force is necessary.  Sept. 11 taught us what harm can come from complacency and inaction in the face of cold-blooded enemies determined to destroy the United States.</p>
        <p>But in a high-tech world, even a superpower cannot protect itself without the help of other countries. Much of the world already resents the United States because of its size and wealth. Even our allies hate being made to feel as if they live on a planet in which only one country's opinion matters. The biggest challenge for the United States is not how to win the next military encounter, but how to conduct itself so that other nations willingly accept its leadership.</p>
        <p>The most effective way to make other countries comfortable with American military power is to demonstrate that the United States has their best interests at heart, too. They will not be impressed by the offer of a kind of Pax Americana, in which Washington makes the world safe for everyone on its own terms. The United States must buy into the goals that its allies and potential allies have already identified as important. That includes making inroads against poverty, infectious disease and malnourishment around the globe, undermining dictatorships with education and development, and curbing both the spread of horrific unconventional weapons and the dangers of global warming.</p>
        <p>The opportunities today are great. America's relations with Russia are more promising than they have been in decades, China's leaders are newly eager to advertise their friendship, ties with India have notably warmed, and Pakistan, after a long estrangement, is again an important ally of the United States. Even in a recession, America is the world's economic engine. Its return to health will set the pace for Europe's recovery and China's continued development.</p>
        <p>The power of American arms, impressive as it is, has limits. Military action is only part of the foreign policy equation, as current developments in Afghanistan illustrate. Washington still expects other nations to participate in such vital tasks as economic reconstruction and peacekeeping and to help confer diplomatic and political legitimacy on governments secured by American military action. For those practical reasons, the interests of other countries cannot be ignored. A stable world order must be built on a broad international consensus, not American military action alone.</p>
