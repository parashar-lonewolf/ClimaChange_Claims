        <p>LEAD: In Alberto Felix Alberto's dark, fantastic and virtually wordless play, ''Tango Varsoviano'' (Warsaw Tango), illusion and reality become so indistinguishable that every move its four characters make takes on the shadow of menace. The performance of this piece of intrigue - by the Teatro del Sur of Buenos Aires - at the Brooklyn Academy of Music as part of the Next</p>
        <p>In Alberto Felix Alberto's dark, fantastic and virtually wordless play, ''Tango Varsoviano'' (Warsaw Tango), illusion and reality become so indistinguishable that every move its four characters make takes on the shadow of menace. The performance of this piece of intrigue - by the Teatro del Sur of Buenos Aires - at the Brooklyn Academy of Music as part of the Next Wave festival is as stylish as the tango itself.</p>
        <p>The only clearly audible words in the play are lyrics sung on a raspy radio by a popular Argentine diva of the 1940's, a song about a sad woman of the night. And two characters, a housewife named Amanda (Monica Lacoste) and her husband, called only ''the Pole'' (Cesar Repetto), whisper a few phrases. She says only ''please shut up'' in Spanish, mostly to herself; he says softly that whales are committing suicide, there is a hole in the ozone layer and he is in love.</p>
        <p>But there is a story, one that reverberates through the imagination to surprising depths. Amanda imagines - or does she remember? - a swaggering lover called ''the Magnificent'' (Walter Gilmour) and a glittering cafe habituee (Adriana Diaz) called ''the Diva,'' whose violent love affair obsesses her. And she meets, or dreams of, a Polish immigrant to Buenos Aires who marries her. Eventually the lives of these four people intertwine emotionally and sexually in a fatal dance of domination and deceit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Alberto's economy extends not only to words, but to image and gesture as well. With a few sound effects, mostly music, a few changes in lighting and an almost geometric pattern of movement by characters, he creates a world that assaults you with images of desperation and pain. As the actors circle one another down a whirlpool of passion, they create an impression of such intense physical force that you remember later with astonishment that they touch one another but once or twice in the whole performance.</p>
        <p>These actors have worked together and with Mr. Alberto for eight years, and they seem to think, move and even feel as one person. At one point the two women in fact seem to merge and the mystery of the story deepens in part because it is difficult for a moment to tell Miss Lacoste and Miss Diaz apart. Miss Lacoste even acquires briefly the brassy, hollow laughter that is the Diva's only expression, a sound that follows you down the street for hours after the play ends.</p>
        <p>But in the grim world Mr. Alberto is exploring, it is the men who, despite their brutality, become the victims of the macho ideal and Mr. Repetto and Mr. Gilmour reveal the vulnerability of their characters so subtly that you recoil from the final recognition of it much the way these men do.</p>
        <p>''Tango Varsoviano'' starts a bit slowly, but by the end of its 100 minutes, when Amanda whispers ''please shut up'' the last time, it has rocketed along an emotional track so fast that you want to join her plea; much more than this would be unbearable.  DANSE MACABRE - TANGO VARSOVIANO (WARSAW TANGO), written and directed by Alberto Felix Alberto; sets, costumes and lighting by Mr. Alberto; additional costumes by Marta Albertinazzi; sound track created by Carlos Stella and Mr. Alberto; technical assistant, Mr. Stella; artistic director, Tulio Stella. Teatro del Sur presented by Brooklyn Academy of Music, Harvey Lichtenstein, president and executive producer. At Lepercq Space, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Brooklyn.
