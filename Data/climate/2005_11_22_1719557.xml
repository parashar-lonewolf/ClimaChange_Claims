        <p>Iraq's Political Factions Call for Pullout Timetable  For the first time, Iraq's political factions collectively called for a timetable for withdrawal of foreign forces, in a moment of consensus that comes as the Bush administration battles pressure at home to commit to a pullout schedule.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>In an hourlong interview, Bayan Jabr, the 59-year-old interior minister, accused of torture of Sunni Arab detainees, repeatedly denied being a prime instigator of the evils that the transitional government is accused of unleashing on the Sunni minority.</p>
        <p>A15</p>
        <p>Russia Wary of Islam's Rise  In the northern Caucasus, and across all of Russia, Islam faith is on the rise, as is Islamic militancy and the fear that such militancy may lead to tensions like those felt in Europe. The struggle over Islam's place is not seen as a question of whether to integrate Muslims into society, but whether the country itself can remain whole.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Germany's New Leadership  Parliament seems certain to elect Angela Merkel, the leader of the conservative Christian Democratic Party, as chancellor, the first woman to hold the position. In what now seems a swift and unexpected change, Mrs. Merkel's arrival in power signals a shift to a new political generation, one that did not go through the usual rites of passage to power in Germany.</p>
        <p>A3</p>
        <p>Europe May Delay Iran Referral  The leading countries of Europe conferred about Iran, with growing indications that they would not move later this week to refer Iran's recent actions in its nuclear program to the United Nations Security Council for possible sanctions. Western diplomats said it remained important to keep a consensus on Iran.</p>
        <p>A3</p>
        <p>Putin Promises Oil Pipeline  During President Vladimir V. Putin's first visit to Japan in five years, he promised to establish within a year a construction timetable for a pipeline that would carry Siberian oil to the Sea of Japan. Mr. Putin's visit is seen as an attempt to balance Asia's power triangle, left lopsided by flourishing ties between Russia and China.</p>
        <p>A8</p>
        <p>Sharon Sparks Political Shuffle  By quitting the Likud Party, which he helped found, Ariel Sharon, the Israeli prime minister, set off what could be a major realignment in Israeli politics. President Moshe Katsav said early elections would probably be held in March, and Parliament took a preliminary vote to disband itself.</p>

        <p>Cheney Assails War Critics And Faults 'Revisionism'  Vice President Dick Cheney stepped up the White House attacks on critics of the Iraq war, declaring that senators who say Americans were sent into battle on a lie were engaging in ''revisionism of the most corrupt and shameless variety.''</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Representative John P. Murtha, the hawkish Democrat who spent his political career as a staunch Pentagon supporter, came home to Johnstown, Pa., as something entirely different: a war opponent, after calling for an American troop withdrawal from Iraq within the next six months.</p>
        <p>A14</p>
        <p>Officials Ban Canadian Poultry  Federal agriculture officials banned poultry imports from British Columbia after Canadian officials reported finding a duck at a poultry farm that was infected with the flu. The Canadian authorities say the virus that afflicted the duck was not the virulent Asian strain.</p>
        <p>A20</p>
        <p>10 Quarantine Stations Added  Expanding an old weapon in the struggle against infectious disease, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has opened 10 new quarantine stations at major ports of entry in the past 18 months and plans to add several more in the coming year.</p>

        <p>Suit Cites Free Speech Breach  Two people who say they were ejected from a taxpayer-financed appearance by President Bush because of an antiwar bumper sticker filed a federal lawsuit in Denver, charging that event workers and unknown federal employees broke the law.</p>

        <p>Doubts Cast on 1993 Execution  Doubts are being cast on the guilt of a San Antonio man executed in 1993, after the only witness to the crime recanted and a co-defendant said he had allowed the man to be falsely accused under police pressure.</p>

        <p>Senate Backs Charitable Giving  The tax bill passed by the Senate last week includes several provisions to encourage giving to charities and could lead to a significant increase in donations.</p>

        <p>Urgency in Relief Effort Fading  Less than three months after Hurricane Katrina ravaged New Orleans, relief legislation remains dormant in Washington and despair is growing among state and local officials.</p>

        <p>Premature Births Increase  More infants were born last year by Caesarean section, more were born prematurely, and more were born with low birth weight in 2004 than in 2003, according to statistics released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>

        <p>Spitzer's Reform Proposal  Eliot Spitzer, the attorney general of New York and a Democratic candidate for governor, said that if elected he will end a practice that many say is at the root of Albany's dysfunctional government: the power of state lawmakers to draw legislative districts so that incumbents are perennially re-elected.</p>
        <p>B3</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer said that his office was dropping all criminal charges against Paul A. Flynn, a former Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce trader who was accused of aiding illegal trading in mutual funds.</p>
        <p>C1</p>
        <p>Jail Contract Found Illegal  State officials have reached a preliminary conclusion that New York City's $300 million contract for medical care at Rikers Island is illegal because it violates a state law regulating for-profit medical companies, according to the State Commission of Correction.</p>

        <p>Turin Scrambles for Games  Turin, Italy, is in the final, deadline-driven stages of preparation to remake itself as an Olympic city for February's Winter Games. The building-and-fixing boom extends beyond the Olympic sites to the new apartment and office buildings and to a restoration of so many road surfaces that the city may consider adding a detour sign to its official seal.</p>

        <p>G.M. Cuts More Jobs  General Motors announced details of a three-year blueprint to revive its fortunes, including 5,000 job cuts on top of 25,000 previously announced. Analysts immediately questioned whether the plan was enough.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Many G.M. workers met the news of new cuts with a mixture of shock, resignation and frustration with the company's management.</p>
