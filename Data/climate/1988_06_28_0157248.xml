        <p>LEAD: The Prime Ministers of Canada and Norway called today for a binding international agreement to protect the atmosphere from pollution.</p>
        <p>The Prime Ministers of Canada and Norway called today for a binding international agreement to protect the atmosphere from pollution.</p>
        <p>Speaking at a conference on the changing atmosphere, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada proposed a global ''law of the air,'' and Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland of Norway called for a treaty to stabilize the earth's atmosphere and prevent further degradation.</p>
        <p>The two leaders said that the international community must now act to address a range of assaults on the atmosphere, including the global warming projected to result from the greenhouse effect, damage to the protective ozone layer and the acidification of rain and snow.</p>
        <p>Government officials, scientists and environmentalists here said that this was the first time heads of state had proposed an international agreement to protect the atmosphere from a broad range of problems caused by the burning of fossil fuels, industrial pollution and other human activities. A Sense of Urgency</p>
        <p>Last year more than 40 nations agreed to act to protect the ozone layer by limiting use of chlorofluorcarbons, a group of industrial chemicals. But as Mr. Mulroney and Mrs. Brundtland made clear, a treaty to protect the atmosphere would require much more sweeping adjustments, including reducing dependence on oil and coal.</p>
        <p>The conference, ''The Changing Atmosphere: Implications for Global Security,'' was called by the Government of Canada. While there are representatives here from 48 countries, this meeting was not planned as a formal negotiating session and no international agreements will be reached here. Nevertheless, representatives of the Reagan Administration at the conference said it was much too soon to begin considering an international agreement on protecting the atmosphere. They note that the issues and problems involved are far more complex than those in the effort to protect the ozone layer. Generally, however, government and private participants here expressed a sense of urgency about coming to grips with human-induced climate change. New evidence that a global warming, and resulting changes in weather patterns, may already have begun has garnered special attention.</p>
        <p>Dr. James E. Hansen, a climate expert for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, told a Senate committee last week that the global temperature in the first five months of this year was the warmest on record and that the rising temperature trend is almost certainly a result of the greenhouse effect. The effect results from the buildup of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere that trap solar radiation within the atmosphere, raising the earth's temperature.</p>
        <p>Mathematical models predict that as a result of the greenhouse effect, average global temperatures will rise by three to nine degrees Fahrenheit by the period from 2030 to 2050. A rise of this order would cause disruptive shifts in rainfall patterns and, by melting ice and warming the oceans, cause sea levels to rise by a foot or more. The global temperature has not risen by three degrees for more than 10,000 years, and it has been hundreds of thousands of years since there has been a nine-degree change.</p>
        <p>''The impact of world climate change may be greater than any challenge mankind has faced, with the exception of preventing nuclear war,'' said Prime Minister Brundtland, who is chairwoman of the United Nations' World Commission on Environment and Development.</p>
        <p>As the first part of her action plan, Mrs. Brundtland called for an international discussion of ways to reduce energy consumption before the end of this century as a means of reducing carbon dioxide pollution. She said Norway is planning on stabilizing energy use by the year 2000.</p>
        <p>Burning of fossil fuels accounts for most of the carbon dioxide humans are adding to the atmosphere, and also accounts for much of the pollution that leads to acid rain.</p>
        <p>The Norwegian leader proposed an international research program on renewable energy sources, the transfer of benign energy technology to developing countries and accelerated scientific research into climate problems. She also proposed a ''global convention on the protection of the climate,'' to coordinate research, information exchange and ''concrete measures to reduce emissions of harmful substances.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mulroney was not as specific in outlining his plan for an international law of the air but Canadian officials here said reduction of fossil fuel use would be among the elements.</p>
        <p>William A. Nitze, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Environment, Health and Natural Resources, said it would be ''premature at the current moment to contemplate an international agreement that sets targets for greenhouse gases.''</p>
