        <p>A3-10</p>
        <p>French Police Officers Shot in Violent Unrest  Rioters fired shotguns at the police in a working-class suburb of Paris, wounding 10 officers as the fast-spreading urban unrest escalated dangerously just hours after President Jacques Chirac called an emergency meeting of top security officials and promised increased police pressure.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Afghan Reconstruction Slow  Four years after American-led forces ousted the Taliban, the United States has spent $1.3 billion on reconstruction in Afghanistan, but Afghans see a wasteful, slow moving effort that benefits foreigners far more than themselves.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Small Turnout in Azerbaijan  After months of pre-election tension in a nation that has never had a free and fair election under its ruling family, only 40 to 50 percent of eligible voters cast their ballots for Parliament amid new allegations of fraud and government abuses.</p>
        <p>A3</p>
        <p>Bird Flu Suspected in China  China announced that three people in whom pneumonia was initially diagnosed, including a girl who died, are now suspected to have had bird flu. The government asked the World Health Organization for help investigating the cause of their illness.</p>
        <p>A4</p>
        <p>Marine Killed in Husayba  A marine was killed in an insurgent ambush when his patrol raided a house in Husayba, the first American casualty in a Marine-led sweep through the area aimed at stopping foreign jihadists from infiltrating Iraq through the Syrian border.</p>
        <p>A8</p>
        <p>Iran Asks to Resume Talks  Iran said that it has asked the three European countries involved in stalled negotiations over Iran's nuclear program to resume the talks. The announcement came as the government said it had reversed an earlier decision and allowed United Nations inspectors to visit a military site.</p>

        <p>NATIONAL</p>
        <p>A14-20</p>
        <p>Tornado Hits Midwest, Killing at Least 22  At least 22 people were killed and hundreds more were injured, some critically, when a tornado tore across southwestern Indiana and northern Kentucky, cutting a path of destruction about 20 miles long and three-quarters of a mile wide.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Gov. Blanco Outlines Agenda  Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco opened a special session of the Louisianna Legislature, telling lawmakers that their actions over the coming days would serve as a catalyst for healing and a guiding light for the rebuilding of New Orleans and other areas devastated by Hurricane Katrina.</p>
        <p>A14</p>
        <p>No Evidence of Iraq Pressure  With Democrats stepping up their attacks over prewar intelligence on Iraq, the Republican leader of the Senate Intelligence Committee said the panel's initial work had found no evidence of ''political manipulation or pressure'' in the use of such intelligence.</p>
        <p>A14</p>
        <p>F.B.I. Restrictions Sought  Republicans and Democrats in Congress called for greater restrictions on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's ability to demand business and personal records in terrorism investigations without a judge's approval and to retain the records indefinitely.</p>
        <p>A20</p>
        <p>New Ally for Environmentalists  In their efforts pushing Congress to pass legislation on global warming, environmentalists are gaining a new ally. Evangelical groups that are part of the base of conservative support for leading Republicans are campaigning for laws that would reduce carbon dioxide emissions, which scientists have linked with global warming.</p>
        <p>A18</p>
        <p>More Students From Abroad  The number of international students entering American graduate schools rose 1 percent this year, despite a 5 percent drop in applications from foreign students.</p>

        <p>NEW YORK/REGION</p>
        <p>B1-8</p>
        <p>After a Week of Rancor, Candidates Are All Smiles  Public opinion polls showed the contest for New Jersey governor between Jon S. Corzine and Douglas R. Forrester getting tighter, with Mr. Corzine's lead dwindling in some cases. Images of the candidates smiling and shaking hands on their final campaign weekend contrasted sharply with their venomous attacks of the last week.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>One Last Push in New York  Mayor Bloomberg and his Democratic challenger, Fernando Ferrer, made competing appeals to voters on the need for change versus the need to stay the course, and both candidates asked supporters to ignore polls showing Mr. Bloomberg with a commanding lead.</p>

        <p>SPORTSMONDAY</p>
        <p>D1-10</p>
        <p>New Record on PGA Tour  Bart Bryant won the PGA Tour Championship by six strokes over Tiger Woods. Bryant shot a three-under-par 67 and finished the 29-man tournament with a record score, 17-under-par 263. That broke Phil Mickelson's mark of 267 set in 2000.</p>
