        <p>''Congestion is a result of demand exceeding supply, said James J. MacKenzie, a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute, a Washington based non-profit organization that studies environmental problems.</p>
        <p>Then he got to the point: There are too many vehicles on too few roads.</p>
        <p>Mr. MacKenzie was speaking a global truth. Bumper-to-bumper backups are hardly limited to the Lincoln Tunnel approach or the Santa Monica Freeway. Drivers, spanning from Latin America to Southeast Asia, suffer them daily. And their pain will only get worse. By the end of the next decade, according to World Bank estimates, nearly 3.3 billion people will be living in urban areas, and they will be driving 816 million automobiles.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, a recent report by the Texas Transportation Institute rated Los Angeles as the American city with the worst traffic. Drivers in the city where the car is king face longer rush hour commutes, more lost time, more wasted fuel and increased potential risk of accidents, than do their counterparts in any other municipality in the country.</p>
        <p>Internationally, there is no definitive study. But World Bank transportation specialists indentifed five cities with traffic conditions that easily rival those in Los Angeles. They are New Delhi, Lagos, Cairo, Manila and Jakarta.</p>
        <p>In each of these cities, a litany of depressingly familiar problems play out day after day. The streets, stifled by constant gridlock, are smog-ridden and deafening. Old  and badly maintained vehicles burn fuel  at an alarming rate, belching out a cocktail of toxic and carcinogenic pollutants, including carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide and hydrocarbons. Those gases make up 30 percent of the greenhouse gases that many scientists say are responsible for global warming. To add to the noxious mix competing in the dizzying anarchy of crowed streets, diesel trucks and buses release microscopic suspended particulates containing as many as 40 known human carcinogens.</p>
        <p>These conditions are not only maddening and unhealthy, they are also costly, running as much as 5 percent of a country's gross domestic output, according to Edward Dotson, an urban specialist at the World Bank.</p>
        <p>Efforts to improve traffic congestion</p>
        <p>in these cities have been sporadic. In New Delhi, for instance, commercial vehicles more than 8 years old have been banned. In Jakarta, legislation has been passed that sets emission levels for all cars, forcing owners keep their vehicles up the standards or pay for maintanance.</p>
        <p>Most attempts to play on public concern have been met with a cynical reaction, or almost no reaction at all. In Europe and Latin America, a plan to lessen traffic density by restricting daily driving according to odd and even number license plates has failed because wealthy drivers simply buy additional cars, insuring they had one for each day. Many others continue to drive, openly risking citations.</p>
        <p>Last month, more than 800 cities worldwide heeded the call to observe car-free day, on which use of private vehicles was restricted. But many drivers ignored it, and some criticized the whole idea as as a gimmick, not a lasting solution.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dotson pointed to Singapore, where drivers are restricted from traveling within the city's central area unless they pay a permit fee, as a rare positive example.This method successfully deters people from driving and increases the use of mass transport, he said.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, mass transit often fails to serve suburbs. Without a comprehensive network, roads from suburb to suburb are as congested as suburb to urban roadways, said Mr. Mackenzie of the World Resources Institute.</p>
        <p>And while building more roads may solve the problme of congestion in the near-term, he said, it could actually increase density and automobile dependence. It's a short grace period, then you are right back to where you started.</p>
