        <p>LEAD: A delegation of officials from Houston recently visited the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Lee M. Thomas, and brought a disturbing message: The city had done everything it was told to do to meet the federally mandated standard for ozone, but was not even close to doing so.</p>
        <p>A delegation of officials from Houston recently visited the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Lee M. Thomas, and brought a disturbing message: The city had done everything it was told to do to meet the federally mandated standard for ozone, but was not even close to doing so.</p>
        <p>''We have been very diligent,'' Dallas Evans, chief of the Houston Air Quality Control Bureau, said in a recent interview. ''We have done everything E.P.A. told us to do to control the sources of ozone, but we are not going to get there. Not this year, not next year or maybe ever.''</p>
        <p>Houston is one of about 70 cities, including New York, that the environmental agency says will be unable to meet a Dec. 31 deadline for reducing ozone, a gas that is a major component of smog and a cause of respiratory problems. Mr. Thomas has served notice that, unless Congress amends the 1970 Clean Air Act, he will have to ban the construction of large new sources of the pollution, such as power plants, refineries and industrial dry cleaners, in those cities that cannot meet the deadline. Situation in New York</p>
        <p>Los Angeles is often cited as the city that must go the farthest to meet the standard for ozone, which is formed by a chemical reaction of hydrocarbons and volatile organic chemicals with sunlight. Southern California may not be able to reach the target until sometime in the next century.</p>
        <p>But ''New York City will not be much faster than Los Angeles,'' said Conrad Simon, director of air and waste management for the E.P.A. regional office in New York.</p>
        <p>New York is also among about 70 cities that will not meet a Dec. 31 deadline for lowering carbon monoxide pollution, mostly from motor vehicles. Earlier this month, Mayor Koch said he would support $10-a-day fees on vehicles entering the southern part of Manhattan in an effort to reduce pollution.</p>
        <p>Harvey M. Schultz, the city's Environmental Protection Commissioner said that without means to reduce the number of vehicles moving through Manhattan, ''it will be almost impossible to achieve compliance with carbon monoxide and ozone standards.''</p>
        <p>Unlike Houston, New York has not done all that it could to reduce ozone pollution, Mr. Simon said. It has not, for example, installed devices to recover gasoline vapors at service stations, or regulated commercial solvents or paint fumes. But ''the most intractable problem'' for New York, he said, was air pollution coming from states upwind of the city.</p>
        <p>Mr. Simon added that part of the problem is that the E.P.A. ''may not have done a proper job of enforcing the rules.'' Rules Tightened 10 Years Ago</p>
        <p>Critics of the agency contend that it has not provided the leadership it once did in seeking ways to reduce pollution and that industrial polluters have used E.P.A. inaction to avoid spending money on pollution controls.</p>
        <p>It has been 17 years since the Clean Air Act was passed and 10 years since the law was substantially amended and tightened. But the nation is still far from achieving the goals of the act.</p>
        <p>In addition to the problems of ozone and carbon monoxide pollution, acid rain continues to fall, destroying life in some freshwater lakes, eroding buildings and, according to some research, contributing to forest and crop damage and threatening human health. Toxic air pollutants that can cause cancer or other serious illness still seep from factory smokestacks and vents.</p>
        <p>There is, however, agreement among Government and state regulators and environmentalists that substantial progress has been made in cleaning up the nation's air. Certainly there are no longer cities whose skies at midday are dark from pollution nor cities suffering from episodes of illness and death caused by foul air, as there were before the Clean Air Act was adopted.</p>
        <p>In a recent report on air quality trends, the E.P.A. found that the nation had made progress in the 10 years from 1976 through 1985, in some cases dramatic progress, in reducing the air pollutants specifically cited by Congress when it adopted the act. Levels of sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, soot and dust, lead and even ozone have all declined. 'Serious' Health Threat</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the report also found that ''air pollution still remains a serious public health threat in many areas of the country.''</p>
        <p>Far-reaching amendments to the Clean Air Act, recently introduced in the House and Senate, are now the focus of an intensifying debate over why the nation has not done a better job of cleaning up its air and what, if any, new legislative and regulatory action is needed.</p>
        <p>The amendments would extend the deadlines for achieving the ozone standards while requiring more rigorous efforts to do so, impose requirements on power plants to reduce the pollution that produces acid rain and authorize the E.P.A. to take swifter action to reduce toxic air pollution.</p>
        <p>But because of the prospect of the Government banning new sources of pollution in the cities facing the Dec. 31 deadline, the ozone issue is at the center of the debate at the moment.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't say anything dramatic has gone wrong,'' said Mr. Thomas, the E.P.A. Administrator, when asked why so many cities would fail to meet the ozone deadline. ''It's just that the basis we had for establishing a target date for meeting the standards has proved faulty.'' Unforeseen Problems</p>
        <p>In some cities, he said, the population has grown more rapidly than expected. Also, the kind of controls proposed for reducing pollution were not as efficient as anticipated, he said, and the problem of pollution being transported long distances through the air had not been anticipated.</p>
        <p>''It's a tougher problem than we thought,'' Mr. Thomas said.</p>
        <p>But Richard E. Ayres, chairman of the National Clean Air Coalition, an alliance of environmental, public health, consumer and labor groups, faulted the agency for the failure of cities like New York to meet the ozone standard. ''The E.P.A. is giving no leadership,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ayres contended that the act was working better ''when the E.P.A. was serious about enforcing it.''</p>
        <p>His criticisms were echoed by S. William Becker, executive director of the State and Territorial Air Pollution Program Officers. ''We don't believe E.P.A. has provided state and local governments with the tools essential to clean up the air,'' he said. Guidance for States and Cities</p>
        <p>Mr. Becker added that if the Federal agency had continued to provide states and cities with detailed guidance on how to reduce air pollution as it did in the 1970's, at least 50 cities that are now expected to miss the deadline would be able to comply with the law.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thomas responded, ''It is totally nonproductive to put the blame on E.P.A. or state and local officials or Congress for the fact we are not meeting the ozone standard.'' He said that his agency had provided plenty of guidance to the states.</p>
        <p>He said he opposed the amendments introduced in Congress to deal with ozone because they were too ''prescriptive'' about what should be done. Since conditions vary from city to city, he said, each requires different solutions.</p>
        <p>John Quarles, a former deputy director of the E.P.A. who is now chairman of the clean air project of the National Environmental Development Association, a coalition of large companies and some building trade unions, also believes that ''the fundamental structure of the Clean Air Act is sound'' and that, with some exceptions, industry has been able to absorb the costs of pollution control ''without disruptive effects.''</p>
        <p>He said the proposed amendments ''are really far more burdensome than they are worth.''</p>
        <p>But Senator George Mitchell, the Maine Democrat who introduced the amendments, said changes in the law were necessary because ''this is a public health problem of the first magnitude,'' and people are becoming ''impatient at the slow pace with which E.P.A. is using its authority.''</p>
