        <p>INTERNATIONAL 3-16</p>
        <p>A Growing Divide on Climate  According to a report by a United Nations body that analyzes global warming, the world's richest countries are spending billions of dollars to limit their own risks posed by climate change, but just tens of millions of dollars to limit climate hazards in the world's most vulnerable regions.  1</p>
        <p>Signs of Hamas Buildup  Senior Israeli officials say that Hamas, the dominant faction in the Palestinian government, is building its military capacity in the Gaza Strip.  1</p>
        <p>Britain Takes Conciliatory Tone  After more than a week of mounting confrontation over its 15 sailors and marines held in Iran, Britain sounded a more conciliatory tone, saying it had responded to a diplomatic message from Tehran and was ready to ''peacefully resolve this issue.''</p>

        <p>Death Toll Climbs in Bombing  The Iraqi government gave its first official reckoning of the truck bombing Tuesday in the northern city of Tal Afar, putting the death toll at 152 people, a number about double early reports.</p>
        <p>10</p>
        <p>A 'Green' Palm Sunday  ''Eco-palms'' are the rage in churches across the United States because of the social and environmental benefits they represent: they are collected in a way that helps preserve the forests in Mexico and Guatemala where they are harvested, and more of the sale price ends up in the pockets of the people who cut them.  3</p>
        <p>Japan Rewrites History  In another sign that Japan is pressing ahead in revising its history of World War II, new Japanese high school textbooks will no longer acknowledge that the Imperial Army forced mass suicides among civilians in Okinawa, the government announced.</p>

        <p>Ex-Adviser Critical of Bush  President Bush's chief 2004 campaign strategist, Matthew Dowd, now says that his faith in Mr. Bush was misplaced. In speaking out, Mr. Dowd became the first member of Mr. Bush's inner circle to break so publicly with him.</p>

        <p>Giuliani Speaks Out on Kerik  Buffeted once again by bad news about Bernard B. Kerik, his disgraced former police commissioner, Rudolph W. Giuliani said he should have looked more closely into Mr. Kerik's background and acknowledged that it might cause voters to question his judgment.</p>
        <p>15</p>
        <p>Girls Striving for Perfection  Many high school girls are high achieving, ambitious and confident, but that often feels inadequate when competing with all the other girls around the country who are applying to the same elite colleges.</p>
