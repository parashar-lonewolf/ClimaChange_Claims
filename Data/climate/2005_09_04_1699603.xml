        <p>IN the days when milk was delivered to most people's doors, so was locally bottled soda. It was often dropped off in wooden crates and the delivery driver would return for the empties.</p>
        <p>Cities like Bridgeport, New Haven and Waterbury were each able to support multiple soda companies. At the industry's peak, in the 1920's, there were probably 5,000 local bottlers in the country.</p>
        <p>Residents are not going to find many milkmen left, but in Connecticut, there are at least five local bottlers still making soda the old-fashioned way, and some even deliver.</p>
        <p>''It's unusual for a state as small as Connecticut to have so many independent bottlers,'' said Paul W. Bates, a leading bottle collector and the proprietor of the Tennessee-based Museum of Beverage Containers and Advertising. ''The main difficulty is getting the thicker returnable bottles. Without a good source of bottles, it just isn't viable as a family business anymore.''</p>
        <p>There's nothing modern about these companies, unless you count their Web pages. For the most part, they are family businesses started in the early part of the 20th century, some carried on by descendants of the original entrepreneurs. Nobody's getting rich.</p>
        <p>''If I had to divide the hours I work into my paycheck, it would be humiliating,'' said Bill Potvin, one of four brothers who run Hosmer Mountain Bottling Company in Willimantic. The business was launched in 1912, using spring water from the base of Hosmer Mountain. (The company now uses well water.) The brothers' father, Arthur, became the fourth owner of the company in 1958, and it has been a family affair since.</p>
        <p>Everything about Hosmer Mountain is vintage, including the ancient, cracked route books that Peter Baker, a veteran driver, uses to deliver soda to customers six days a week. Many of Hosmer's 1,200 active and inactive customers, stretched across 20 routes, are buying the company's line of diet sodas, or they're buying none at all. Some of the entries in the book show a string of negative answers to the question, ''Need any soda this week?'' One sign of the times is that Hosmer Mountain also delivers spring water.</p>
        <p>The Hosmer Mountain bottling plant, in Columbia, looks like something out of a newsreel, relying on 1940's-era equipment that lines up the 12-ounce returnable glass bottles like little soldiers and moves them down the assembly line at a rate of 68 a minute. (Modern equipment handles thousands of cans or disposable bottles a minute.)</p>
        <p>Andy Potvin, sweating profusely in the overheated bottling room while stirring a 100-gallon vat of grape syrup, is the brother in charge of the temperamental machinery. It can break down anywhere along the complicated process, which starts when water is pumped into a tall cylindrical carbonator, where it is infused with carbon dioxide. The carbonated water is flavored in a proportioner, which measures out the proper amount of syrup. One gallon of highly concentrated syrup extract makes 1,800 quart bottles of soda.</p>
        <p>Returned bottles are loaded into the washer, an antique acquired from a Coca-Cola plant 40 years ago. The bottles are immersed in a 150-degree caustic soda solution for 20 minutes, and are stripped of their paper labels. One of the more important jobs is hand-inspecting them for cracks or other imperfections. The vintage Meyer bottling machine injects soda into 32 bottles at a time, after which they are capped and sent down the line to the labeler. At the end of the line is an automated case packer that puts the bottles into crates.</p>
        <p>Castle Soda of Ansonia delivers within about a 25-mile radius, including New Haven, Bridgeport and Litchfield. A family business launched in 1906, it packs its seven-ounce sodas in ancient wooden crates from 1940, stained dark from use. A 24-bottle crate filled with flavors ranging from white birch beer to strawberry soda costs the company's 2,400 home-delivery customers $7.</p>
        <p>Just six people make and deliver Castle Soda. It is not uncommon for the driver who is handling two heavy crates at a time to be Ken Dworkin, the company president. The vice president, Dave Pantalone, a 31-year veteran whose father and grandfather were once owners, said finding suitable bottles is one of his biggest headaches.</p>
        <p>Crack open a case of Castle Soda and chances are that a few of the bottles will have painted labels from defunct bottlers, some from Connecticut and some from as far away as Wilkes-Barre, Pa. ''Every town used to have a bottler, but they're mostly gone,'' Mr. Pantalone said. ''It's a real shame.''</p>
        <p>Castle Soda supplements its home-delivery business by supplying soda to more than 300 restaurants, from pizzerias to V.F.W. halls. A nephew of Ken's, Brian Dworkin, runs Castle Seltzer of Derby, which delivers soda in nostalgic siphon-top bottles.</p>
        <p>New Britain is home to Avery's Beverages, a family business that has been through several hands and is now owned by Rob Metz, a corporate refugee who describes the old barn, now a factory and retail store, as a ''working museum.'' Avery's bottles more than 30 flavors for 600 home-delivery customers and is making inroads into the youth market with its line of Totally Gross sodas, including Swamp Juice, Toxic Slime and Dog Drool (not as bad as they sound). Avery's welcomes the public with a kid-friendly ''Make Your Own Soda'' program. The young mad scientists helped produce the new flavors.</p>
        <p>Avery's also buys bottles from ''orphan'' bottlers, including a rare windfall: an 80,000-bottle hoard from a defunct bottler in Michigan. But the bottle problem is ever-present.</p>
        <p>''When articles like yours come out, I get lots of new customers,'' Mr. Metz said. ''It's great, but it also makes me say, 'Oh no, more bottles going out.''' He added that rising fuel prices are increasing his costs and he is considering adding a surcharge or raising prices by 10 to 15 percent.</p>
        <p>Mark Mazurkiewicz, a driver and one of only five employees, said Avery's Swamp Juice is ''flying out the door.'' But the older flavors also have their fans.</p>
        <p>''We had an 80-year-old lady from California come visit, and she was in tears because she hadn't had an Avery's soda since 1963,'' Mr. Mazurkiewicz said.</p>
        <p>Some old customers now in other states order cases of Avery's for the nostalgia value.</p>
        <p>The bottle-supply problem has forced the Foxon Park Bottling Company of East Haven to experiment with plastic bottles, but it is obvious the owners aren't happy about that step.</p>
        <p>''I'm not sure we'll stay with plastic,'' said Anthony Naclerio, who like his brother, Ray, is a third-generation member of the founding family of Foxon Park, which is 83 years old.</p>
        <p>Foxon Park makes 18 flavors of soda (including Gassosa, a lightly lemon flavored Italian-style drink), but it no longer delivers to homes, finding the restaurant trade more lucrative. Foxon Park also sells syrup for soda systems. The Internet is now serving Foxon's customers: For $27.99, it provides a crate of 10 flavors, including cherry, iron brew (a root beer/cream soda hybrid) and white birch beer, plus a pair of logo glasses thrown in as part of the deal.</p>
        <p>The Light Rock Beverage Company of Danbury has an even lower public profile than Foxon Park's. Pat Madkour, a member of the Antos family, which has bottled the brand since 1905, said Light Rock is a contract packager, mostly bottling for other brands. But it is also making Cool Tommy's, a new brand in 24-ounce plastic bottles that can be found in some stores around Danbury.</p>
        <p>These sodas are local, but they still stack up nationally. Even without the input from home-delivery customers, Foxon Park's soda is distinctive enough to be featured on the Food Network's ''Viewer's Choice'' segment. It has also earned good marks from the reviewers at BevNet (www.BevNet.com). They described the company's draft-style root beer as having ''a slightly creamy body and a touch of wintergreen to the finish.''</p>
        <p>Hosmer Mountain came in fourth in the national Great American Root Beer Showdown. ''Big punch at first, then a creamy vanilla aftertaste. Yummy!'' one reviewer said.</p>
        <p>With connoisseurs getting into the act, is it possible that locally brewed soda will become as popular as beer from microbreweries?</p>
        <p>''I doubt it,'' Mr. Bates said. ''Beer drinkers are a special breed apart, and they have more brand loyalty than soda drinkers do. Kids aren't likely to get into specific branding like that.''</p>
