        <p>TWO years ago Paulette Cole had a big idea that would alter the fundamental nature of her company.

        <p>TWO years ago Paulette Cole had a big idea that would alter the fundamental nature of her company. She not only wanted its furniture to be environmentally conscious; she wanted, to whatever degree possible, every chair, lamp and pillow sham to have social resonance beyond the cash-and-carry transaction, whether that meant the preservation of a dwindling rain forest or help for an impoverished, widowed weaver. So she called a meeting with her senior management and laid out a new business plan.</p>
        <p>Not everybody was thrilled. ''Some people thought my vision was flaky,'' Ms. Cole said. A few staff members later chose to leave, she said, in ''a natural peel-away of people who didn't understand that vision.''</p>
        <p>''They didn't understand,'' she said, ''that we were in a position to create the demand.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Cole's company isn't just the kicky little boutique that could. It is ABC Carpet and Home, the trendsetting Manhattan department store, which had nearly $80 million in sales last year, according to Hoover's business reports. It is where pricey Frette sheets share sales floors with French handmade chocolates and antique Chinese beds. But increasingly ABC shoppers can also buy jewelry made by Ugandan women afflicted with AIDS, ceramics whose proceeds go to foster schools in rural Guatemala and $1,000 gift certificates that help support Masai girls who refuse to undergo genital mutilation.</p>
        <p>''Knowing that your investment in a product actually has a positive effect on somebody's life makes the design in your hands more important,'' Ms. Cole, 46, ABC's president and chief executive, said recently at her engagingly funky Manhattan apartment, where breakfast is taken at an elaborately carved Anglo-Indian table in a stainless-steel kitchen. ''My goal is for the store to be 100 percent responsible design.''</p>
        <p>She may never reach that level, she admitted, but she said that 20 percent of ABC's stock now fulfills the goal. That's 3 percentage points more than last year, she explained, and it includes ambitious offerings like made-to-order solar energy systems and furniture with all-organic upholstery. The store's packing materials have been replaced with biodegradable alternatives, and all inks used in packaging and stationery are soy-based. A trailer from ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' the documentary that opened last night on Al Gore and his campaign about global warming, is shown on continuous loop on the second floor amid furniture made from sustainable materials.</p>
        <p>The company promotes not only the ABC Home and Planet Foundation, which encourages people to ''align their spending choices with their personal values,'' but also its associations with 15 organizations including Doctors Without Borders and the Rainforest Action Network. As Home Furnishings News, an industry weekly, put it this week in its cover story about environmentally correct home products, ABC ''has made social consciousness a mainstay of its business plan.''</p>
        <p>Back in the 1990's, however, ABC was best known for its boho bling. Working with her husband and co-chief executive at the time, Evan Cole, Ms. Cole transformed the carpet business that her paternal great-grandfather founded in 1897 into a hippie-chic lifestyle destination. She was the engaging but somewhat reserved creative director; the flamboyant Mr. Cole attended to the bottom line and pumped up the publicity volume.</p>
        <p>The huge display windows seemed decorated by Miss Havisham with help from Tim Burton, with piles of lovingly battered antiques and artfully dusty candelabra. Indoors was -- and still is -- an extravaganza of elegant flea-market finds (ormolu-encrusted headboards, Art Deco dressing tables) and boutiques leased to name-brand manufacturers (Harvey Electronics, Mitchell Gold furniture, Pratesi linens).</p>
        <p>Profits soared, but the Coles's partnership took a beating. Two of their children died in infancy (the couple have a daughter, Lena, who is 11), and professional disagreements drove them further apart. Mr. Cole's eagerness to expand ABC's reach (a branch opened at Harrods in London in 1998) clashed with his wife's rising interest in making social issues an official company statement.</p>
        <p>''Post-9/11, I took a leave of absence,'' Ms. Cole said, adding diplomatically, ''It was the most realistic scenario.'' With her daughter often in tow, she went to Mexico, Morocco, Peru and points beyond, experiencing what she called ''a different level of travel.'' She sought out environmentalists, became involved in anti-hunger campaigns and studied poverty in the developing world. ''I chose to look at things the business didn't allow me to experience,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cole also began to see the possibility of using ABC as a soapbox for her causes. It was a vision her husband did not share. The couple divorced, and Mr. Cole sold her his shares in the family-owned company. He now lives in Los Angeles, where he founded H. D. Buttercup, a 100,000-square-foot home furnishings mall. Once Ms. Cole became the company's sole chief executive she began to steer it in a new direction.</p>
        <p>Concerns over fair-labor issues and environmental responsibility are fast becoming part of the home furnishings world, but not all shoppers will become converts. As Marshal Cohen, the chief industry analyst at the NPD Group, a market research company in Port Washington, N.Y., and the author of ''Why Customers Do What They Do'' (McGraw-Hill) put it in a telephone interview, ''In many cases the consumer is not overly responsive to philanthropic causes.''</p>
        <p>''It's a big challenge convincing people that there's a good reason behind a higher price point,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''Often the most successful way to do that is through the lifestyle connection, to convince consumers to do the right thing or the healthy thing, which is why the fastest-growing segment of the beverage industry is organic milk.''</p>
        <p>But according to a study of shoppers' behavior at ABC from June to November of last year, customers willingly paid up to 20 percent more for products bearing labels that cited a positive social impact -- in particular, the use of fair labor practices in their manufacture. (The study, by Michael J. Hiscox, a government professor at Harvard, and Nicholas F. B. Smyth, a Harvard senior, compared purchases of similar products to see if the presence of the labels made any difference; they did.)</p>
        <p>In a store like ABC, with affluent customers and a reputation for a commitment to social causes, Dr. Hiscox and Mr. Smyth wrote, the data showed that ''firms that switch to labeled goods could charge between 10-20 percent extra and expect sales to rise, with stronger effects likely for luxury goods (like candles) than for normal goods (such as towels).''</p>
        <p>Dr. Hiscox explained via e-mail on Tuesday that ABC was the focus of his study because Ms. Cole was ''bold enough to participate in our study when other retailers would not, because they were worried about raising the labor standards issue with their customers.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Cole may be raising the consciousness of ABC, but her concerns are not purely altruistic. ''Beauty is the major criterion for me,'' she said. ''This isn't charity; this is commerce. If there's a product I fall in love with that doesn't have a socially redeeming value attached to it, I might not be able to resist it.''</p>
        <p>And when that happens, she has a practical, unapologetic solution: ''It just won't get a 'Good Wood' label.''</p>
