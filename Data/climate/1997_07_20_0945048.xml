        <p>TWO days short of a year since Trans World Airlines Flight 800 exploded in flight, crash investigators ran one of the most elaborate re-enactments ever, from the same airport, at the same hour of takeoff, flying a 747 of the same vintage over the same flight path. In the belly tank of the plane was the same amount of fuel, from the same refinery in Greece, warmed to about the same temperature by the air-conditioning equipment and -- by chance -- by the same sultry weather as on July 17, 1996.</p>
        <p>The cockpit crew members threw switches on their control panels at precisely the times that the T.W.A. crewmen had. But this time, about 150 sensors tracked temperatures, pressures and fuel/air ratios that had never been measured before. The re-enactment was a success in the sense that the plane reached the altitude at which the explosion occurred within 30 seconds of Flight 800's flight time.</p>
        <p>What is spookiest is not the re-enactment itself, but that it may turn out to be the way of the future.</p>
        <p>Most crash investigations end quickly, because of clues in the wreckage or information from the ''black boxes,'' the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder. This month, at the National Transportation Safety Board's urging, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered airlines to upgrade their old black boxes, and manufacturers to put better ones on new planes. That should cut the number of future mysteries.</p>
        <p>But for those investigations that are not wrapped up quickly, more and more is required. The reason is that regardless of the cost, public tolerance for unexplained air disasters is near zero. More than knowing whether cell phones cause brain tumors or whether acid rain kills forests, people want to know what made Flight 800 blow up, killing all 230 people aboard.</p>
        <p>Fear of Uncertainty</p>
        <p>Public officials confronting other mysterious deaths could probably solve more than 230 of them with a budget of more than $130,000 per death, which is what the safety board has committed so far. (The F.B.I. hasn't said what it has spent, but it is probably more.) But cost is not a factor.</p>
        <p>What counts is the fear of uncertainty.</p>
        <p>''This is a hard business, and it probably is only going to get harder,'' the chairman of the safety board, James Hall, said in an interview. ''The fewer accidents you have, the more reliance you have on aviation transportation, the less tolerance we have for accidents.'' And the expectation is that the Government knows everything and should tell everything.</p>
        <p>Yet the explanations also tend to be increasingly complicated. Planes do not crash for simple reasons; years of learning from mistakes have made planes ever safer. That means each crash is caused by a rare combination of complex circumstances.</p>
        <p>Future investigations may also be complicated because they involve new issues posed by aging aircraft, as the number of old planes grows. Age could be a factor in the crash of TWA 800, which was 25 years old, though there is no evidence so far.</p>
        <p>No matter what the cause, concern over the crash of Flight 800 is so widespread a year later that news organizations are conducting polls of the kind usually used in the New Hampshire primary. On the eve of the anniversary, Fox News said it had surveyed 901 registered voters and found that mechanical failure was the leading candidate in the public's mind, with a missile a strong second and a bomb lagging in third.</p>
        <p>Frustration Upon High</p>
        <p>The question also comes up at Presidential appearances. President Clinton, asked about Flight 800 in a Rose Garden appearance on the anniversary, said he was frustrated ''not to know 100 percent what caused that crash.''</p>
        <p>Eventually, he might know. But the investigation has already consumed more than a year and is likely to take at least another. The Safety Board has spent nearly $30 million -- just housing the wreckage for two years will cost $10 million -- and before it is done it will push the boundaries of engineering knowledge.</p>
        <p>Two years would still be far short of the record, however. Later this year, investigators hope to wrap up the 1994 crash of a USAir 737 near Pittsburgh. That investigation required the safety board to fly two airplanes in a re-enactment, a 737 plus a 727 of the kind that had crossed the USAir plane's path moments before the accident.</p>
        <p>To learn everything possible about another crash, of an American Eagle turboprop in Roselawn, Ind., in October 1994, the board flew one of those planes, an ATR-72, behind an Air Force tanker that sprayed it with water at high altitude to re-create icing.</p>
        <p>The Transportation Department has committed the F.A.A. to a goal of zero accidents. But the way there could lead through even bigger crashes in the future. Difficult as it is to confront the crash of a lightly loaded 737 with ''only'' 230 people aboard, Mr. Hall said that the pressures on investigators and the efforts required will grow again. Plane manufacturers are working on plans, he said, for jets that could carry 1,000 passengers.</p>
