        <p>That words are as much representations as pictures - in a way, they are pictures - has been a subject of interest to artists as diverse as Jenny Holzer, Barbara Kruger, Bruce Nauman and Ed Ruscha. Compared to their work, Larry Johnson's images of short paragraphs of text are less theatrical, but perhaps because they are unvarnished photographs, they seem even more disembodied and confounding.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson is a Los Angeles artist in his 30's whose interest in the ways images and words describe the world has led him to blur the boundaries between photography and language. To him, both the verbal and the visual are prone to rendering reductive stereotypes, and his intriguing hybrid photographs make this point with a vengeance.</p>
        <p>A typical photograph by Mr. Johnson consists of a lollipop-colored ground on which is printed a fragment of a story or reminiscence. The words are reproduced in tasteful type and, on occasion, with decorative flourishes that suggest the influence of graphic design. Most of the stories of the last five years have been ''found'' texts; that is, the artist has appropriated them from sources ranging from TV Guide to Hollywood autobiographies. (Mr. Johnson's interest in the English language is clearly extraliterary.) Recently, however, the artist has begun to write his own texts, using a variety of voices. In his show at 303 Gallery, which opens tomorrow, the cast of unnamed narrators includes a self-conscious intellectual, a cash-starved barfly and a Victorian-era novelist. One might say that Mr. Johnson's narrative alter egos function in the same way as Cindy Sherman's much-discussed disguises: they dispel any sense of a single, authoritative author. The texts have strong narrative voices, but it is left purposefully unclear who is doing the talking.</p>
        <p>In ''Five Buck Word,'' for example, the language is vernacular to the point of being crude: ''But seein' as my cash balance was sunk, I was eager to propel my financial standin' upwards.'' This Huck Finn-style diction contrasts with the tone of an untitled diptych that includes the sticky sentence ''More was their worry when tragedy struck.'' Impending tragedy is one of the themes of Mr. Johnson's writing, along with self-absorption and death.</p>
        <p>Each of the 80-by-60-inch works in the exhibition begins with a large capital letter (a commonplace in book and magazine publishing). The rest of the text is reproduced in an outline typeface that lets the bright background color show through. But to further complicate the issue, the artist has highlighted several letters within each paragraph of text, using different designer colors and connecting them with black lines. One is tempted to decode the highlighted letters as if they were anagrams or acronyms, but they steadfastly remain nonsensical.</p>
        <p>This sense of no sense is reinforced in the one anomalous work in the show, ''Untitled (It Could Make Tonight the Best Part of Your Day).'' Here, instead of a text, Mr. Johnson supplies only the initials of the words within the parentheses of the title, some of which are colored and connected. The apparently meaningless array of letters, which come in a variety of sizes, resembles the eye chart of a deconstructionist ophthalmologist.</p>
        <p>To an extent, the artist is out to entertain his audience by stretching language to its limits, much as the Surrealists did in their ''exquisite corpse'' poems and as William S. Burroughs did with his ''cut up'' prose technique. But by arbitrarily reordering and disconnecting language from its accustomed contexts, Mr. Johnson also seems to suggest that speech is as responsible for the ''image world'' in which we live as images themselves. Or, to put it another way, language's ability to rub away the textures of first-hand experience is no less facile than that of photography.</p>
        <p>One wonders, however, whether Mr. Johnson's point came across more clearly (and more amusingly) when his texts were borrowed from pop-culture sources. By relying on his own ability to mimic the textures of mannered writing, he runs the risk of seeming mannered himself, and of courting the very narcissism he seeks to criticize.</p>
        <p>The show of works by Larry Johnson opens tomorrow at 303 Gallery, 89 Greene Street, and remains there through April 28.</p>
        <p>John Pfahl</p>
        <p>Janet Borden Inc.</p>
        <p>560 Broadway (at Prince Street)</p>
        <p>Through April 14</p>
        <p>Throughout his career, John Pfahl has used the picturesque as an instrument of irony, but never more stunningly than in the 12 color pictures here. At first glance, they seem to be studies of pure atmosphere, their ruddy golden hues recalling the transcendental 19th-century skies of Turner and Constable. But Mr. Pfahl's images of smoke also have fire: the sun-drenched billows he has captured are not nature's own, but the issue of industrial smokestacks. These vertical pillars are the pictures' sole point of reference to the material world, and they are responsible for giving the images their unsettling twist.</p>
        <p>Besides their reference to atmospheric 19th-century painting (in addition to Turner and Constable, one thinks of Whistler and Thomas Cole), the photographs seem calculated to recall Alfred Stieglitz's ''Equivalents'' - cloud studies that the modernist master intended as demonstrations that photographs were inherently expressive independent of their subject matter. That Mr. Pfahl's clouds are formed by industrial emissions, which are held responsible for air pollution and acid rain, is both an environmental statement and a stinging rebuke to Stieglitz's premise.</p>
        <p>Catherine Wagner</p>
        <p>Laurence Miller Gallery</p>
        <p>138 Spring Street</p>
        <p>Through April 14</p>
        <p>Catherine Wagner's photographs are deceptively plainspoken; they look much like the kind of black-and-white documents architects and builders use to chart their progress. But they possess a rare combination of awe for their subjects and a sense of the absurd. In the 16 pictures on display, taken between 1984 and 1987 as part of a series called ''The American Classroom,'' this combination produces Surrealist belly laughs. The camera is focused on the attendance chart of an adult Sunday-school class, a rivet-pocked airplane part used in a class for mechanics, a tray of dead frogs awaiting biology students and the furry disarray of a dog-styling school. No humans appear, just their evidence; the only living things in the pictures are a dog on a pedestal and a cow hooked up to a milking machine. Ms. Wagner, who lives in San Francisco and seldom has shows in New York, knows how to deliver visual punch lines without attracting attention to herself.</p>
        <p>'Mel Bochner: Photo Pieces, 1966-67'</p>
        <p>David Nolan Gallery</p>
        <p>560 Broadway (at Prince Street)</p>
        <p>Through tomorrow</p>
        <p>These Minimalist-era photographs and photo constructions are meditations on the formal possibilities of geometric structure. The artist began one series by arranging cubes according to numerical sequences and strategic variations, producing a set of sculptural forms that he then documented with the camera. The resulting photographs are displayed in grids that together suggest a compulsively comprehensive mind at work. More curious and less enigmatic are several cut-out constructions, in which Mr. Bochner's characteristic intellectual edge nearly gives way to whimsy.</p>
        <p>Still, none of these ''photo pieces'' are particularly winsome; they are, however, relics of a time when photographs served as lowly tokens of an artist's refusal to accept the terms of the art marketplace.</p>
        <p>'Pierre Molinier: Erotic Self-Portraits'</p>
        <p>Brent Sikkema Fine Art</p>
        <p>155 Spring Street</p>
        <p>Through April 14</p>
        <p>These bizarre images are not merely erotic; they are fascinating, repulsive and obsessive. Pierre Molinier, whose life overlapped with European Surrealism but whose sensibility perhaps had more in common with the Marquis de Sade, was a cross-dresser with a knack for fetishism and collage. His palm-sized black-and-white pictures seem to depict the standard repertory of pornography - women in black stockings bent over tables, for example -but with Molinier playing all the roles. What he couldn't accomplish with masks, makeup and play acting, he added with a brush and pencil. Here is one ''outsider artist'' who might just as well stay outside.</p>
        <p>Stephen Frailey</p>
        <p>Lieberman &amp; Saul</p>
        <p>155 Spring Street</p>
        <p>Through April 14</p>
        <p>Stephen Frailey's basic technique remains the same in his new collages - he still is putting objects on found photographs and then photographing the combination - but his focus has shifted from Raymond Chandler melodrama to David Lynch creepiness. The clearest sign of this ''Blue Velvet'' touch is the number of ants that appear in the color prints, which are arranged in sequences that remind one of rebuses. Not that ants (even fake ones) are bad - in, fact, they seem more mysterious than the fedoras and trenchcoats in Mr. Frailey's last show.</p>
