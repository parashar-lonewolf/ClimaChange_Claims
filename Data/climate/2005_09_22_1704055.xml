        <p>The steady climb in oil prices, followed by Hurricane Katrina's disruption of the petroleum markets, has forced a 1970's mood of sobriety on American consumers. With gasoline at the pump hovering around $2.80 a gallon in much of the country, energy conservation is back in vogue, and the small businesses that dominate the renewable-energy industry are on a bit of a roll.</p>
        <p>They are getting a nudge -- that is the most that can be said of it -- from the energy bill that President Bush signed in August and that many of them criticize as deeply flawed. They will take what they can get from it, though, they say.</p>
        <p>But the bigger boost to their businesses comes from market forces. When the price of fossil fuels hits the stratosphere, the purveyors of solar power, wind power, biomass and biofuels suddenly find themselves very much in demand.</p>
        <p>Just listen to Steven J. Walker, founder and president of New England Wood Pellet Inc. in Jaffrey, N.H. His company's wood pellets -- small plugs of compressed sawdust and wood shavings left over by lumber mills -- are used to heat more than 600,000 homes. The pellets are burned in highly efficient stoves, furnaces and boilers at half the cost of oil or natural gas.</p>
        <p>''We're refusing 90 percent of the orders coming in,'' Mr. Walker, 38, said. Last year, he said, he supplied fuel for 20,000 homes, most of them in New England but some in New York and Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>''It's a little bit scary,'' he said. ''We are bumping up our production by 50 percent this year.''</p>
        <p>The 13-year-old company's revenue has climbed 40 percent a year during the last five years, to a projected $10 million this year, he says, and the enterprise is highly profitable. Mr. Walker expects his work force to grow to 50 from the current 30 within two years.</p>
        <p>It is just as well, Mr. Walker says, that the new energy bill did not deliver a 25 percent rebate on the purchase of pellet-burning stoves or boilers that his congressman, Charles F. Bass, a Republican, lobbied for at his urging. If it had, he says, he would be even more overwhelmed.</p>
        <p>The bill, widely derided by environmentalists for what they see as generous subsidies to the fossil fuel industry, does provide an array of tax and production credits that go to either the consumers of renewable energy or to the estimated 20,000 companies, most of them small businesses, that harness renewable energy sources. But critics say the benefits are relatively paltry, often poorly thought out and, worst of all, in effect for only two years.</p>
        <p>''The energy bill tweaks everything but changes nothing,'' said Michael T. Eckhart, president of the American Council for Renewable Energy.</p>
        <p>Yes, some companies will benefit, he concedes, but not enough for renewable energy's share of the market to grow, a goal that is being aggressively pursued in Europe and much of Asia. In the United States, nonhydro renewable sources like wind power and solar and geothermal energy, account for just 2 percent of power output.</p>
        <p>In contrast to Washington's tepid promotion of alternative energy, however, many states have embraced it, creating huge new opportunities for some companies.</p>
        <p>Among the leading states is New Jersey, which in 2004 enacted legislation that offers homeowners and businesses sizable incentives that substantially reduce the initial cost of installing renewable energy systems.</p>
        <p>Combined with the new federal tax credits (up to $2,000 for a residence), a $27,000 three-kilowatt solar electric system able to power an average-size house would cost New Jersey residents just $10,000. (New York and Vermont have similar incentives that would knock the price down to $15,000 and $19,000, respectively.)</p>
        <p>Similarly, a New Jersey business that installed a $500,000, 70-kilowatt system could reduce the actual price to $90,000 by taking advantage of both the state rebates and the federal commercial tax credit, which was raised in the new energy bill to 30 percent, from 10 percent. Based on current energy prices, this investment could be recouped within 10 years through energy savings.</p>
        <p>New Jersey's law has been a windfall for Global Resource Options Inc., an installer and packager of solar-power systems in White River Junction, Vt. Since the law went into effect, orders from New Jersey have soared from nothing to 70 percent of the business. ''There has never been a better time to go solar,'' said Jeff Wolfe, the co-founder with his wife, Dori, of Global Resource Options, which is active from Maine to North Carolina.</p>
        <p>Largely as a result of New Jersey's incentives, Mr. Wolfe said, revenue should more than double this year to more than $10 million from less than $5 million.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the federal energy bill's biggest beneficiaries in the renewable-power industry are the small farmers and farm cooperatives in the Midwest involved in the production of ethanol, an automotive fuel derived from corn that is blended with gasoline to form gasohol.</p>
        <p>The new law requires the gradual blending of renewable fuels like ethanol and biodiesel into the nation's fuel supply. The ethanol requirement begins at 4 billion gallons in 2006 (up from 3.5 billion today) and goes up to 7.5 billion gallons in 2012, when the ethanol incentives are set to expire. The guaranteed market is already spurring new production.</p>
        <p>After a $52 million expansion of its first ethanol plant, to raise its capacity to 90 million gallons a year from 45 million gallons, the Midwest Grain Processors cooperative, made up of nearly 1,400 farmers in 14 states, is investing $85 million for a second plant, with a capacity of 57 million gallons. That would bring the cooperative midway to its target of a capacity of 300 million gallons by 2008.</p>
        <p>''We see a lot of New York money trying to get invested; we farmers are just trying to hold on to a piece of it,'' said its president, David Nelson of Belmond, Iowa, in a cellphone interview from his 18-wheeler that he was driving to an ethanol plant with a load of corn. ''Ethanol is not the silver bullet, but it has been tremendously good for rural communities, helping people to stay on the land.''</p>
        <p>For producers of wind power, the two-year limit on a combination of tax credits and accelerated depreciation that can reduce a project's cost by half or more has created a ''land rush'' mentality, according to John Calaway, chief executive of Superior Renewable Energy, a Houston wind-power developer.</p>
        <p>The feast-or-famine diet is highly disruptive to a growing industry, critics says, especially by stunting its manufacturing base. Little wonder that wind-related manufacturing in the United States is dominated by foreign companies (the same is true of solar power). The industry now imports some of its towers from Vietnam, and the lack of domestic competition, along with the worldwide boom in wind power, is keeping prices high.</p>
        <p>Moreover, critics say, the new bill shortchanges small producers, feeding the trend toward domination of the industry by a few big companies and away from Europe's decentralized model. Even so, with some 2,500 megawatts of wind power expected to be added in each of the next couple of years, on top of 6,740 megawatts of current capacity, smaller players are finding niches.</p>
        <p>Community Energy Inc., a nonprofit company in Wayne, Pa., for example, has marketed about 85 percent of new 250 megawatts of wind power that has come online in Pennsylvania and West Virginia since 1999, according to its president, Brent Alderfer.</p>
        <p>In what is, in effect, a partnership with utility companies, Community Energy has been able to recruit large numbers of customers willing to pay a modest premium for what it heralds as high-quality and environmentally friendly electricity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Alderfer projects company revenue of $10.5 million this year, up from $8 million last year, and he expects to buy equity in new wind projects.</p>
        <p>''We are asking people to step up and make a choice,'' Mr. Alderfer said. ''It's not so much that it's a tough sell, it's just a new element that is not in most people's economic thinking.''</p>
