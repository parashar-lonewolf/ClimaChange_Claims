        <p>Just what is going on here? This week, the veteran science journalist John Horgan reviews Chris Mooney's ''Republican War on Science,'' a book he calls a ''diatribe'' marred by ''preaching-to-the-choir self-righteousness'' -- but one that gets a vitally important story basically right. ''Scientists can at times act like just another special interest group, trying to get a bigger slice of the federal pie,'' Horgan said in an e-mail message. ''And they are too quick to peg you as an 'anti-science' religious nut if you oppose, say, funding for stem-cell research.'' Still, he insists, the claim that the administration has manipulated scientific information on issues ranging from climate change to abortion to missile defense isn't just the fevered fantasy of Bush-hating polemicists. ''The actions of the administration have been so egregious that I believe scientists are justified in calling it 'anti-science,' '' he said, adding, ''Uh-oh, I'm letting my bias show.'' Horgan's review begins on Page 11.</p>
