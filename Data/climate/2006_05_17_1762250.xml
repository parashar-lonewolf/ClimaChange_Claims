        <p>ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE wants chicken farmers to stop using antibiotics to spur growth. It wants strict controls on the budding field of nanotechnology. It wants fewer gas guzzlers on the road.</p>
        <p>Not long ago, when it was still the in-your-face Environmental Defense Fund, the group would have looked for a company to sue, boycott or at least protest. Nowadays, it is looking for companies that can help it out.</p>
        <p>''Our informal motto used to be 'Sue the bastards,' '' Fred Krupp, the group's president, said. ''Now our official tagline is, 'Finding the ways that work.' ''</p>
        <p>So Environmental Defense enlisted McDonald's to put pressure on chicken suppliers; Tyson Foods, for one, has already responded by slashing its antibiotic use. It worked with DuPont on nanotechnology regulations that both hope to prod Congress to pass. It joined with FedEx and the Eaton Corporation to convert part of the FedEx truck fleet to hybrid vehicles. The trucks are already being rolled out nationally.</p>
        <p>''The meetings were so candid and amicable, an outsider would not have known who worked for who,'' saidD. Mitchell Jackson, managing director for the environment at FedEx Express.</p>
        <p>If politics makes for strange bedfellows, global warming, endangered forests, dwindling water supplies and scary new technologies have made for even stranger ones. Environmentalists and corporations are engaging in a new spirit of compromise.</p>
        <p>''The idea that 'it's none of their damned business' when it comes to environmental risks has disappeared,'' said Ian W. Fowler, a former executive at BP and now a consultant to nonprofit groups.</p>
        <p>Environmental groups still wield the threat of public criticism, boycotts and lawsuits. But they are also willing to collaborate and give pats on the back. Corporations, under pressure to go green, are baring their souls and books to onetime critics, and asking them for help.</p>
        <p>''We've gotten more calls from corporations in the last two years than in the prior 18 combined,'' said Michael J. Brune, the executive director for Rainforest Action Network.</p>
        <p>Professional peacemakers say their phones are ringing. ''Corporations that once asked us to get activists off their back now ask us to engage them in productive conversations,'' said William K. Shireman, president of Future 500, an environmental conflict-resolution group.</p>
        <p>Both sides are publicizing their newfound d√©tente. DuPont immediately issued a press release promoting its high ranking on a global warming scorecard issued in March by Ceres, a coalition of environmentalists and investors. FedEx is displaying the Environmental Defense logo on its hybrid trucks. Citigroup's annual corporate citizenship report includes praiseworthy quotes from environmentalists who once castigated the company for lending money to suspect projects.</p>
        <p>''We still don't agree on everything, and we never will,'' said Pamela P. Flaherty, Citigroup's senior vice president for global community affairs. ''The change is, more environmentalists are willing to publicize the areas in which we do, in fact, agree.''</p>
        <p>The bonhomie has rippled well beyond the usual cast of characters. In 2003, Tiffany &amp; Company hooked up with the environmental group Earthworks to set up a meeting with environmentalists and jewelry manufacturers to talk about sound methods for mining gold and silver. One outcome was a guidebook, released in October, laying out the practices that the jewelers expect miners to follow.</p>
        <p>''We want to get out in front of mining issues before jewelry becomes tarnished in the public mind,'' said Michael J. Kowalski, Tiffany's chief executive.</p>
        <p>Regulators are capitalizing on the new peace. The Environmental Protection Agency has long been concerned about the possible toxicity of perfluorooctanoic acid (usually called PFOA), a chemical in waterproof clothing and nonstick cookware. Regulating the substance could take years, said Susan B. Hazen, acting assistant administrator for the agency's Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances. So last year, the agency called together a group of chemical companies and environmentalists to discuss how to control PFOA's. Each company voluntarily curtailed its use of the substance.</p>
        <p>''Everyone set aside their parochial interests, and we reached agreement in a few months,'' Ms. Hazen said.</p>
        <p>The slow pace of regulatory change has actually helped foster partnerships. Companies and environmentalists both think that rules on issues like greenhouse gases, endangered forests and genetically modified crops are inevitable, and they want a hand in setting them. That is why DuPont, for one, includes environmentalists on its internal biotechnology advisory panel.</p>
        <p>''Our ability to get product to market is moving faster than the E.P.A.'s ability to get rules out, and we want to agree in advance on what the rules of the road should be,'' said Linda J. Fisher, DuPont's chief sustainability officer.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists say they feel the same way. They no longer expect Washington to tackle global warming, for example, and they know they cannot sue companies for violating laws that do not exist. So they have to become more cooperative.</p>
        <p>Just ask Jonathan Lash, a self-described ''regulatory Stalinist'' who spent the 1970's and 80's alternately working for the government and for activist groups as a chief litigator. Now, as president of the World Resources Institute, he spends much of his time initiating cordial meetings with companies. ''Government is failing to provide leadership on environmental concerns, and industry has grown more willing to address them,'' Mr. Lash said.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists, in turn, have become smart dealmakers. The Conservation Fund recently collected money from utilities to buy land that it donated to the government for a wildlife refuge. In exchange, the government gave the utilities carbon emissions credits equal to the amount of carbon dioxide the trees absorb.</p>
        <p>''It's no longer the scruffy bighearted liberal talking to the crisp-white-shirt industrialist,'' said Lawrence A. Selzer, president of the Conservation Fund. ''Today's environmentalists know all about shareholder returns.''</p>
        <p>And chief executives know a lot about the environment these days, and have imbued the corner office with a sensitivity that their predecessors lacked.</p>
        <p>''Jack Welch was a pre-Earth Day guy who saw environmental advocates as tree-hugging greenies, while Jeff Immelt is of a generation that recognizes and respects environmental issues,'' said Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, referring to the former and current chairmen of General Electric.</p>
        <p>Paul V. Tebo, who was DuPont's vice president for health, safety and environment until he retired in 2004, has seen the chemical industry's leadership evolve. ''The old chief executives just defended themselves from attacks,'' he said. ''But in the late 1980's, new people took over at DuPont, at Dow, at Monsanto, and they stood up and said, 'Hey, we've got to do better.' ''</p>
        <p>Environmentalists can tell the companies what to do better. The World Wildlife Fund has been helping the Coca-Cola Company, which has been criticized for its water-use practices in India, analyze the risks to water supplies around the world.</p>
        <p>Thanks to the Internet, the world knows all about the companies. The E.P.A. uses it to post risk assessments, and to invite public comment. Companies use it to post their environmental performance statistics. Environmentalists use it to disseminate both praise and criticism. ''Greenwashing is a lot harder when anyone can go to the Web and see if a company's claims are true,'' said Hugh C. Hough, the president of Green Team Advertising, which specializes in environmental ads.</p>
        <p>The relationships are not perfect. Bile still flows.</p>
        <p>In March, the Dogwood Alliance and ForestEthics, two groups that have applauded Staples and Office Depot for curtailing sales of paper products from endangered forests, orchestrated a series of demonstrations at OfficeMax stores, protesting what it said was the chain's refusal to follow suit.</p>
        <p>''We've been talking to OfficeMax for two years, and they are still lagging,'' said Kelly Sheehan, the campaign coordinator at Dogwood Alliance. The charge surprises Susan A. Mills, director for environmental practices at OfficeMax. ''We've certainly been in conversation with Dogwood Alliance, and we've developed a paper procurement policy with their input,'' she said, adding that OfficeMax is working with the National Recycling Coalition and others.</p>
        <p>Moreover, environmentalists are no more homogeneous than the corporate world. Many environmental groups have praised General Electric for its Ecomagination program, which promotes green technologies, as well as its environmental training efforts in China. But that has not stopped Riverkeeper and other groups from complaining that the company has been slow to clean up the chemicals it discharged into the Hudson River three decades ago.</p>
        <p>''G.E. has been antagonistic and duplicitous from the beginning, and we just can't form a productive relationship,'' said Alex Matthiessen, the president of Riverkeeper.</p>
        <p>G.E., of course, sees it differently. In 2002, the company said it would cooperate with the E.P.A. in its insistence that the company dredge the Hudson, and Stephen D. Ramsey, G.E.'s vice president for corporate environmental programs, said that the company was doing everything the agency asked.</p>
        <p>''Maybe we can't reach an agreement with Riverkeeper,'' he said, ''but G.E. has a long and rich history of productive partnerships with environmental groups.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps the best example of the relationship that is evolving between companies and environmentalists is the Sierra Club's interaction with the Ford Motor Company. Last July, the Sierra Club endorsed Ford's hybrid Mercury Mariner sport utility vehicle. It even made the car available for test drives at its own convention in September.</p>
        <p>Yet when Ford released its Corporate Climate Change report last December, the Sierra Club issued a press release denouncing Ford for having the industry's most gas-guzzling fleet of cars, and the report as ''another example of corporate rhetoric trumping reality.''</p>
        <p>''We'll applaud when they do something right, but the wariness on each side is undiminished,'' said Daniel F. Becker, director of the Sierra Club's global-warming program.</p>
        <p>Yet Ford and the Sierra Club still meet regularly. ''Environmental groups give us key signals about how our customers want us to address fuel economy, climate change and other issues,'' said Niel L. Golightly, Ford's director for sustainable business strategies. ''And even if we don't agree on everything, both sides are gradually realizing that there's a whole lot more to be gained by working together than by throwing brickbats.''</p>
