        <p>With the presidential election now less than two years away, George W. Bush started honing his team yesterday for the coming campaign. He did so by dismissing his top two economic advisers, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Lawrence Lindsey, a White House aide. The decision rids the White House of men whose counsel was not always followed -- and, in the case of Mr. O'Neill, whose political stumbles were legion. Given President Bush's fear of following his father into early retirement because of a weak economy, the shake-up may also be prelude to a new raft of ambitious but ill-advised economic stimulus proposals.</p>
        <p>Renewed economic activism could prove as fiscally reckless as the huge tax cuts that Mr. Bush sold to Congress in the first months of his presidency. To his credit, Mr. O'Neill, who was often right but rarely effective in his job, had lately expressed reservations about the White House's desire to fashion an ambitious stimulus package, reservations that may have forced his departure. Some measured incentives to foster economic growth may be needed, but Mr. O'Neill was right to worry about rising budget deficits, and to question the merits of further income tax cuts and various tax breaks for investors.</p>

        <p>With the presidential election now less than two years away, George W. Bush started honing his team yesterday for the coming campaign. He did so by dismissing his top two economic advisers, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Lawrence Lindsey, a White House aide. The decision rids the White House of men whose counsel was not always followed -- and, in the case of Mr. O'Neill, whose political stumbles were legion. Given President Bush's fear of following his father into early retirement because of a weak economy, the shake-up may also be prelude to a new raft of ambitious but ill-advised economic stimulus proposals.</p>
        <p>Renewed economic activism could prove as fiscally reckless as the huge tax cuts that Mr. Bush sold to Congress in the first months of his presidency. To his credit, Mr. O'Neill, who was often right but rarely effective in his job, had lately expressed reservations about the White House's desire to fashion an ambitious stimulus package, reservations that may have forced his departure. Some measured incentives to foster economic growth may be needed, but Mr. O'Neill was right to worry about rising budget deficits, and to question the merits of further income tax cuts and various tax breaks for investors.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Neill was never a favorite of conservative Republicans, who suspected he didn't share their tax-cutting fervor. He preferred to focus on a ''revenue-neutral'' simplification of the tax code. Before being reined in during the 2001 tax-cut fight, he once dismissed the effort as ''show business.''</p>
        <p>In many ways Mr. O'Neill was the domestic counterpart of Colin Powell, another moderate member of the Bush team who often finds himself out of step with his colleagues. Mr. O'Neill differed with the president on a range of issues, from the proper response to the corporate accounting scandals to global warming and steel tariffs. Unlike Mr. Powell, he never seemed to win any internal policy debates, and lacked the political skills to defend Mr. Bush's policies effectively.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Neill's weaknesses undermined his credibility in representing the United States on economic matters overseas, a critical aspect of the job these days. In contrast with Robert Rubin, who mastered the art of economic diplomacy as Bill Clinton's Treasury secretary, Mr. O'Neill's performance on the global stage was marked by damaging gaffes and a sense that he didn't really speak for the president.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush now has an opportunity to appoint a forceful Treasury secretary who can help him shape and communicate the administration's economic policies, and play a leadership role in global economic matters. If he wants that sort of partner, he would be well advised to bypass political operatives and economic ideologues.</p>
