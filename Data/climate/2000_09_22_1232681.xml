        <p>This week the presidential candidates revealed a new campaign strategy: sight gags. On Tuesday, Al Gore made a cameo appearance during Jay Leno's monologue, holding cue cards. (''It's the man who invented the cue card,'' Mr. Leno said while the laughing vice president shook hands with audience members.) Then yesterday on the syndicated ''Live with Regis,'' George W. Bush walked out wearing a dark silk tie and matching shirt, a jokey reference to Regis Philbin's trademark wardrobe from his other show, ''Who Wants to be a Millionaire.''</p>
        <p>For the many viewers who get their news from television, this is shaping up as the week's most pressing campaign question: would you rather have a president who can hold cue cards or one who dresses like a game show host?</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush have received immense publicity recently from spots on puffball talk shows, vapid though their conversations were. Each candidate had a full hour on ''Oprah'' to say he loved his family and to reveal his favorite food. Mr. Gore appeared with David Letterman, but left the singing to his vice-presidential candidate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, who belted out ''My Way'' on Conan O'Brien's show. The ripple effect has sent giddy sound bites everywhere.</p>
        <p>Behind their smiles, the candidates are fiercely playing the politics of personality. And as the sound bites get so silly that they call for drum rolls, the differences between the candidates all but vanish. Making identical points, that they have a sense of humor and are solid family men, the candidates could easily have emerged as one affable two-headed creature called GoreBush. Such alternate television appearances are meant to reach voters who are not glued to CNN, but they reach them with a hollow message: vote for me, I'm a good guy.</p>
        <p>The candidates' appearances with Oprah Winfrey included her regular segment called ''Remembering your Spirit,'' which presented filmed reports on how the Gores and the Bushes preserve the spirit of their marriages. Apparently a large photo album and sappy piano music help. On ''Regis,'' Mr. Philbin showed family snapshots of George W. Bush as a baby with his dad, as a boy on a pony and as a father holding his newborn twin daughters. The candidates even echoed each other on ''Oprah'' by saying that the elderly should not have to choose between buying food or prescription drugs; such feel-good phrases do not help voters decide who has a better health care plan. But Ms. Winfrey, who could be as tough as any political reporter if she wanted to, knows her audience too well to expect it to sit still for a heavy policy discussion.</p>
        <p>The unspoken bargain is that serious considerations are outside the range of these shows, a conspicuous point during Mr. Gore's visit to ''Late Show with David Letterman.'' Of all the talk-show hosts, Mr. Letterman tried hardest to get answers to substantive questions. After asking about the famous Al-Tipper convention kiss, he got around to global warming and the plea bargain of Wen Ho Lee, accused of mishandling nuclear secrets. Mr. Gore deflected the questions with jokes. ''You're such a wonk,'' he told Mr. Letterman, and seemed a bit baffled, as if he were thinking, ''Hey, this is supposed to be a comedy show.''</p>
        <p>Though the content is vacuous, these guest spots matter a lot in terms of media imagery. Since the Democratic convention, the wooden Al Gore seems to have disappeared and his poll numbers have risen; talk shows give him a chance to keep the laughing, kissing Al Gore visible.</p>
        <p>But as Mr. Bush's media fortunes have fallen, he needed to put himself in situations that played to his strengths. He got days of bad publicity (and comedians got a windfall of material) after an open mike caught him referring to a reporter for The New York Times with a bleepable term. Soon after, his use of the nonword ''subliminable'' brought back the persistent question of his intellectual capabilities. Talk shows could help counter that image of blundering, letting him display his personal appeal in a friendly atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Even in comic settings, the candidates can make a few sideswiping points against their opponents. On the Letterman show, Mr. Gore's Top 10 List of rejected Gore-Lieberman campaign slogans included, ''We know when the mike is on.''</p>
        <p>But the candidates themselves face little danger. On ''Regis,'' one tantalizing, dangerous possibility never materialized. Mr. Philbin's co-host for the day was Susan Hawk, the truck driver who appeared on ''Survivor'' and who memorably ranted at the two finalists, calling them a rat and a snake. She could have screamed at Mr. Bush, ''You're a rat, and Gore's a snake'' (or vice versa). In fact, she was extremely polite. In the loss of dignity department, the show featured a man who smashed wooden boards against his head, trying to set a world record (he only tied it), though he was not on the same segment as Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>When a candidate is behind in the polls, he has to take some media risks. Recently Mr. Bush's staff has contacted the Letterman show to discuss a possible appearance. His last,  by satellite, featured a time delay and jokes no one got. It is still replayed as evidence of a talk-show disaster. Conquering the Letterman show might do him more good than dozens of policy speeches.</p>
