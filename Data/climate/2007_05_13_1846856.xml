        <p>HURRICANE FORCE</p>
        <p>In the Path of America's Deadliest Storms.</p>

        <p>Illustrated. 128 pp. Kingfisher/</p>

        <p>(Ages 10 and up)</p>
        <p>What do you tell a child when a natural disaster darkens the news? ''Things like that don't happen here.'' ''The grown-ups in charge have it under control.'' And when it does happen here, and the grown-ups in charge haven't a clue, there's Plan C: ''Scientists are working on it.''</p>
        <p>In ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' ''here'' is the whole world, and hard-working scientists bring both bad news and good: Humans are changing the atmosphere in ways that will harm the earth, but we can delay or modify the effects if we act soon. That double-edged message has found a large</p>
        <p>audience as a slide show, a film and a book for adults. Now comes a book version for children 11 and up -- or, as the cover puts it, ''Adapted for a New</p>
        <p>Generation.''</p>
        <p>Adapted how? For starters, this book is better organized than the original, with a table of contents, chapter headings and an index -- useful features that the adult edition lacked. It is also about 40 percent shorter. Much of what has disappeared is Gore himself; his autobiographical musings are gone, replaced by a brief introduction. Fair enough: Readers who barely remember the 2000 election will care more about Gore's message than about the personal journey that led him to spread it.</p>
        <p>What remains is most of the ''good parts'' of the movie: enough geoscience to explain the basics of climate change, and a travelogue of parts of the world where global warming either poses a threat or (Gore suggests) has already taken hold. The beleaguered polar bears are here. So are shrinking glaciers in Switzerland and atop Mount Kilimanjaro, New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina and deteriorating coral reefs. The main culprit is carbon dioxide; the solution, a grab bag of technical fixes. ''We have everything we need to begin solving the climate crisis,'' the book concludes hopefully.</p>
        <p>The science, as far as it goes, is well supported, but some foibles remain from the film. Gore pegs recent hot spells and extreme weather like Hurricane Katrina to global warming a lot more confidently than most climate scientists are ready to do. Many experts suspect that the recent run of hot summers is due to global warming combined with an upward swing in natural temperature fluctuations. A swing back could cool things off for a while, even as overall warming continues. Gore is also mighty optimistic about the ease of reining in humanity's appetite for carbon-spewing combustion.</p>
        <p>The big question, however, is whether the book's intended audience still needs it. The DVD of the film is required viewing in many schools. Politicians, news editors and curriculum developers are piling onto the green bandwagon. The next generation has plenty of inspiration; what it needs now is nuts-and-bolts information for school reports and debates. Who is doing the science, and where and how? How do researchers analyze satellite data and computer models? What is likely to happen in the near future? This book doesn't tackle those questions, but someone must.</p>
        <p>Information abounds in Joseph B. Treaster's book ''Hurricane Force,'' but it goes down so smoothly you won't notice. The story starts in the path of Hurricane Katrina, which Treaster covered in August 2005 as a correspondent for The New York Times and witnessed as it struck downtown New Orleans. ''I watched as a dangling traffic light shot across an intersection like a bullet pass, then swung back on its tether,'' he writes. ''Nearby, windows shattered and glass sprayed down on the sidewalk like lethal snow.''</p>
        <p>A Florida native and a veteran of a dozen hurricanes, Treaster knows his subject. He explains how hurricanes originate as fragile combinations of swirling, moist air and warm ocean water, how they change character on coming ashore, what makes them so capricious and deadly and, finally, how disaster agencies plan for their arrival.</p>
        <p>Scientists are the heroes of the early chapters. Meteorologists from the National Weather Service track storms from command posts inside concrete bunkers. Some fly straight into them to drop instrument canisters, crossing into the eye of the hurricane -- ''a place of powerful beauty,'' as one researcher describes it. Later, the spotlight shifts to emergency planners, aid workers and victims. Treaster also tells his exciting ''how I got the story'' story: driving into New Orleans on the eve of the storm's landfall, shadowing the police chief, listening to overwhelmed 911 operators and interviewing residents as the city flooded.</p>
        <p>The dozens of photographs and some well-chosen maps mesh with the text. There are no how-it-works diagrams, but the writing is so vivid that readers won't miss them. A hurricane is ''a roaring natural turbine'' wrapped around ''a flexing double column of air -- like a rumpled sleeve within a rumpled sleeve.'' Its path over land zigzags ''in a windshield-wiper effect.'' It's no surprise that Treaster's annotated list of references (a welcome extra) includes fiction by Joseph Conrad and Jack London.</p>
        <p>Readers will finish this book fascinated but probably content to keep their distance. Despite better forecasts and hurricane-proof building techniques, Treaster makes it clear that when a big storm wheels ashore, the best place to be is somewhere else. ''Unless I'm reporting on a storm,'' he concludes, ''you won't find me trying to reason with hurricane season.''</p>
