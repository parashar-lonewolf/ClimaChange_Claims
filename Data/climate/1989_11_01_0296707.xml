        <p>LEAD: When all the coal, natural gas and oil have been burned, or the world does not dare burn any more because of global warming, what will be used for fuel, especially for cars, trucks and buses?</p>
        <p>When all the coal, natural gas and oil have been burned, or the world does not dare burn any more because of global warming, what will be used for fuel, especially for cars, trucks and buses?</p>
        <p>The answer, many experts say, is hydrogen, because when it burns - in vehicles, industrial boilers or home furnaces - it produces almost nothing but a gentle puff of steam. It can be made using electricity from solar cells through a process simple enough that it is performed daily in high school chemistry labs. And it can be stored for future use.</p>
        <p>''Hydrogen is almost an environmentalist's dream come true,'' wrote Robert H. Williams and Joan M. Ogden, researchers at Princeton University, in a recent study on making hydrogen from solar power.</p>
        <p>Hydrogen is far from perfect; when burned it produces only about half the energy required to create it. And between creation and combustion, it is difficult to handle.</p>
        <p>But the concept has attracted increasing interest. In addition to the Princeton researchers' study, which was sponsored by the World Resources Institute, a nonprofit group based in Washington, a newsletter on hydrogen is now published in Washington to track global developments.</p>
        <p>Most of the research is in other countries. The Soviets have built hydrogen-powered airplanes. The provincial government of Quebec and the European Community are in the middle of a two-year joint study on using surplus hydroelectric power from Quebec to make hydrogen that would fuel bus fleets. Two dozen institutions and private companies are helping to finance the $3.3 million study.</p>
        <p>West German researchers are building a pilot plant in eastern Bavaria. Bayernwerk A. G., a large German utility based in Munich, is building the project with BMW, the auto company, Siemens A. G., the electric equipment manufacturer, and two other companies. They are also studying ways to increase the efficiency of hydrogen production from water.</p>
        <p>Mercedes-Benz is also active in hydrogen research, and has converted cars to run on hydrogen.</p>
        <p>Hydrogen is not so much a fuel as a form of storage, holding energy generated by electricity and then releasing it without producing carbon dioxide, the gas thought to be responsible for half of global warming.</p>
        <p>To make the hydrogen, electric current, which can be generated by photovoltaic cells that tap the sun's energy, is run through water that has a chemical catalyst, in a device called an electrolyzer. The water molecules are divided into hydrogen and oxygen gases. The hydrogen can then be shipped by pipeline for use in many of the same ways as natural gas. For use as a transportation fuel it must be compressed into a liquid or combined with other chemicals, to decrease the size of the fuel tank necessary to hold it. Burning the hydrogen - or recombining it with oxygen in a reaction that gives off heat - produces nothing but H2O and small amounts of nitrous oxide, from nitrogen picked up from the air. These can be easily controlled.</p>
        <p>Hydrogen is clean enough, in fact, to burn indoors, without a chimney.</p>
        <p>Burning the hydrogen gives back only half the energy that went into making it, but if the solar power is cheap enough, or the premium on reducing greenhouse gases is strong enough, the low efficiency is acceptable.</p>
        <p>But hydrogen is difficult to handle. While it is not toxic, as gasoline is, it will burn or explode over a wide range of concentrations, and under some circumstances it can make metal brittle. In addition, a far larger volume of hydrogen than of natural gas or oil is needed to accomplish the same work.</p>
        <p>Also, substantial energy is required to compress it to a liquid for storage, and the liquid tends to boil away.</p>
        <p>But hydrogen is easier to store than electricity itself, barring major breakthroughs in chemical batteries or superconducting materials that could be used as batteries.</p>
        <p>The ability to store electric energy is important because if the world goes on a low-combustion diet, forgoing fossil fuels, experts point out, the major sources of energy will probably be dammed water, nuclear fission and sunlight.</p>
        <p>All three are used to make electricity that is well suited to providing heat, light and mechanical power, but the storage problem makes it hard to use in transportation. Batteries are the weak link in experimental electric cars, and even nonportable storage systems like pumped-storage hydroelectric projects and subterranean vaults pumped with compressed air have found only limited success.</p>
        <p>The rapidly falling cost of photovoltaic cells makes hydrogen more attractive, engineers say. In fact, according to the Princeton researchers, hydrogen and solar photovoltaic panels overcome each other's weaknesses.</p>
        <p>Hydrogen's weakness is that while it burns cleanly, it makes little sense to use unless it is produced cleanly. The cheapest source of energy to make hydrogen would probably be coal, but that fuel is a greenhouse culprit. Nuclear reactors are another source, but they can run at night or in cloudy locations, so it makes more sense to use their energy directly, not store it at a substantial cost.</p>
        <p>But electricity made by solar cells is in the wrong form for most uses, and requires ''conditioning.'' Without conditioning, a homeowner with a big electric bill could cover the roof with solar cells and get plenty of energy but have no way to use it, because the product is low-voltage, direct-current power, while refrigerators, air-conditioners and lights run on high-voltage alternating current.</p>
        <p>The conditioning equipment is expensive, especially for small installations. Engineers predict that for efficiency entire neighborhoods will have roofs covered with photovoltaic shingles and will be wired together to a central conversion station. But a more efficient method would be to find a use for the low-voltage power without having to convert it.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, makers of photovoltaic cells, facing the difficulty of energy storage for use in cloudy periods or at night, are looking to hydrogen to solve that problem. ''The marriage is a good one,'' said Dr. David Carlson, vice president and general manager of Solarex, a Rockville, Md., subsidiary of the Amoco Corporation that is the largest American-owned photovoltaic company. ''It gives you a total system solution,'' said Dr. Carlson, a pioneer in cell development.</p>
        <p>It also allows the use of solar power in locations remote from the sun. The Princeton researchers suggest making the hydrogen in the deserts of the Southwest and sending it through pipelines originally built for natural gas, after supplies of that gas are depleted. Although rainfall is scarce in the desert, the water required is only a small fraction of desert rainfall, they said.</p>
        <p>Assuming cells that are 15 percent efficient and electrolyzers that are 84 percent efficient (both slight improvements over standard equipment now in use), replacing all oil in use would require an area of 24,000 square miles, which is five-tenths of 1 percent of the country, or 7 percent of its desert area.</p>
        <p>The Princeton study said the United States has about two acres of cropland per person, but the land required for photovoltaic hydrogen would be only about 0.13 acre per person.</p>
