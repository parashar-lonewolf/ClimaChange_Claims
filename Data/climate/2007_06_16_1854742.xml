        <p>In the 1999 comedy ''Pushing Tin,'' John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton portray rival air traffic controllers who spend their workday guiding planes in and out of New York's airports.</p>
        <p>A sequel, though, might be called ''Pushing Plastic.''</p>
        <p>Facing mounting public pressure to become more fuel efficient and reduce emissions, the airlines are seeking to replace older jets in their fleets with lighter-weight, less-polluting planes. Increasingly, that means replacing the traditional aluminum components in a jet with plastic-based composites that can significantly reduce its weight.</p>
        <p>Aircraft makers, eager for orders, are responding with new designs that make more and more use of these composite materials.</p>
        <p>Louis Gallois, the chief executive of Airbus, a unit of EADS, pledged this week a 25 percent increase in spending on improving aircraft designs and technologies so that by 2020, Airbus aircraft will burn less fuel and emit 50 percent less carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>Boeing, too, is investing heavily in developing green technologies, working together with airlines and makers of jet engines.</p>
        <p>Much of this investment will be devoted to finding uses for new, lighter materials to increase the fuel efficiency of the planes. Both Boeing and Airbus will be using composites in at least half the structural components of their latest wide-body jets, the 787 Dreamliner and the A350-XWB.</p>
        <p>A composite, broadly defined, is a combination of two or more industrial materials that exhibits the best properties of each and additional qualities that the individual materials do not possess alone.</p>
        <p>In the aerospace industry, composites are made of nonmetallic fibers -- carbon, fiberglass or aramid -- embedded in a resin of plastic or epoxy that is molded and then cured in autoclaves at high temperatures.</p>
        <p>A material like carbon fiber, for example, is stronger and stiffer than aluminum, titanium or even steel, but its relative weight per volume is half that of aluminum and one-fifth the weight of steel.</p>
        <p>For airlines, the recent advances in composite technology could not come at a better time. ''Our carbon footprint is growing, and that is not politically acceptable,'' Giovanni Bisignani, chief executive of the International Air Transport Association, said this month at a meeting of executives representing 260 of the world's airlines. ''Climate change will limit our future unless we change our approach.''</p>
        <p>While the airline industry says it accounts for just 2 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions, steady economic growth and increasing demand for air travel are expected to raise aviation's contribution to 3 percent of worldwide carbon dioxide emissions by 2050.</p>
        <p>Rising oil prices, meanwhile, are cutting into airline profits, pushing carriers to demand better performance and longer range from the new planes they buy. According to the air transport association, aircraft fuel efficiency has increased by an average of 2.5 percent a year since 2003, saving the industry about $2 billion a year. But the industry expects its fuel bill to rise by $8 billion, to $119 billion, this year, representing 26 percent of operating costs.</p>
        <p>''The biggest thing about composites is that it gets fuel costs down,'' said Howard Wheeldon, an aviation industry strategist at BGC Partners in London.</p>
        <p>Boeing's 787, which is to enter commercial service next year, has an all-composite fuselage and wing. Boeing says the plane, which can seat 210 to 330 passengers, will burn about 20 percent less fuel than existing jets of its size. Airbus says its slightly larger A350, which is still in the design phase and not expected to enter service until 2013, will be made of 52 percent composites and achieve comparable levels of fuel efficiency.</p>
        <p>But lighter planes do not just burn less fuel. Since airport landing fees are partly based on the weight of the aircraft, a lighter fleet can represent a significant cost savings to airlines. According to the air transport association, airlines and passengers pay at least $43.5 billion a year in airport landing fees and other taxes, equivalent to 11 percent of global airline revenue.</p>
        <p>Jet manufacturers say composites also resist fatigue and erosion better than metal, reducing maintenance costs because jet inspections do not need to be as frequent or extensive.</p>
        <p>Jeanne Yu, an engineer who heads Boeing's environmental performance group, said maintenance intervals for composite-built jets could be as much as twice as long as those for aluminum planes, although regulators will probably await proof of manufacturers' claims before approving significant changes to current inspection regimes.</p>
        <p>After the crash of an American Airlines Airbus A300 in November 2001, when a composite tail fin broke off, some air safety experts called for stricter standards for inspecting and repairing composite components.</p>
        <p>Besides cutting fuel consumption, ''savings on maintenance is the main factor that makes composites attractive to airlines,'' said Scott Hamilton, an airline analyst based in Issaquah, Wash.</p>
        <p>For jet manufacturers, meanwhile, composites can simplify the production process because they allow for the creation of larger, more integrated parts. And since composite sections are cast into precise molds, they do not, like aluminum, have to be cut and shaped from sheets of bulk material, eliminating a lot of waste.</p>
        <p>There are also benefits for passengers. Because they are stronger and stiffer than aluminum, composites make it possible for airlines to increase the air pressure in the cabin significantly. Cabin air pressure in aluminum wide-body jets is typically equivalent to what a person would experience at an elevation of 8,000 feet above sea level, a factor that contributes to the fatigue that travelers experience on long-haul flights.</p>
        <p>Boeing says air pressure on the 787 will be the equivalent of an elevation of 6,000 feet, while Airbus plans to pressurize the A350 at 5,000 feet. Composites' resistance to corrosion also means that the relative humidity of the air inside the cabin can be higher than the 10 to 20 percent typical on today's planes -- an improvement for passengers because dry air is another source of discomfort.</p>
        <p>The technology of building airplanes has taken quantum leaps forward since Orville and Wilbur Wright's first biplane made of wood, wire and cloth lifted off at Kitty Hawk, N.C., in 1903. In the decades that followed, manufacturers have experimented, with varying levels of success, with everything from plywood to aluminum, titanium and other strong but lightweight metals.</p>
        <p>Boeing began using fiberglass in a limited way in the 1960s on its 747s. In the mid-1980s, two Boeing 737s were flying commercially with all-composite stabilizers on the tail. Boeing's use of these ultra-light materials has increased significantly in the last decade. Airbus, too, has stepped up its use of composites.</p>
        <p>''The trend is clearly toward more composite,'' Jeff Turner, the chief executive of Spirit AeroSystems, which builds carbon fiber and other composite components for Boeing and Airbus, told investors at a meeting in March. ''Whether it totally eclipses the metal airplane or not, I couldn't say.''</p>
