        <p>THE WORST OF TIMES By Patricia G. Miller. Harper Perennial, $12. Before the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision in 1973, women seeking abortion were often forced to resort to illegal procedures. This book documents their experiences, not only in their words but also in those of abortion providers, police and the children of those who died. "Anyone who even ventures an opinion on abortion should reckon with what this book so vividly conveys," Le Anne Schreiber said here last year.</p>

        <p>FIRST LOVE, LAST RITES By Ian McEwan. Vintage International, $10. Originally published in 1975, when the author was 27, this short-story collection is peopled with misfits, some menacing, many tortured. But Mr. McEwan's characterizations evoke empathy rather than alienation, said our reviewer, Michael Mewshaw: "With consummate style he staves off any suspicion of tawdry intentions." Vintage International has also reissued Mr. McEwan's first novel, THE CEMENT GARDEN ($10), which explores the twisted world four children invent for themselves after they resolve to keep the death of their widowed mother a secret. "Ian McEwan is a skillful writer, absolutely in control of his material," Anne Tyler said here in 1978.</p>
        <p>PILGRIM IN THE RUINS: A Life of Walker Percy By Jay Tolson. Chapel Hill/University of North Carolina, $16.95. The son and grandson of men who committed suicide, Walker Percy combined faith in science and faith in religion to create for himself personal peace and a career as a writer. In 1992 our reviewer, Madison Smartt Bell, said this "portrait of Percy as the quiet and unassuming hero of his own life is very moving."  NEW AND SELECTED POEMS By Mary Oliver. Beacon, $14. Winner of a 1992 National Book Award, this collection attempts to reconcile the harshness of the world with qualities that would enable us to love it. "Although few poets have fewer human beings in their poems than Mary Oliver, it is ironic that few poets also go so far to help us forward," Stephen Dobyns said here.  FREUD'S MOSES: Judaism Terminable and Interminable By Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi. Yale University, $12. The author, a historian, analyzes Sigmund Freud's book "Moses and Monotheism," arguing that despite its unorthodox approach, the work can still be read as a celebration of Judaism. In 1991 our reviewer, Robert Coles, called this an "intriguing, elegantly narrated book." Also reissued is A HISTORY OF THE JEWS IN AMERICA, by Howard M. Sachar (Vintage, $20), which shows how World War II and the immigrant experience helped forge the bond Jews in the United States feel with Israel. The book is "not only good history but a contribution to the current debate over American-Israeli relations," William L. O'Neill said here in 1992.  SHADOW PLAY By Charles Baxter. Penguin, $10.95. This novel unfolds in a depressed Michigan town where Wyatt Palmer, a local bureaucrat, agrees to look the other way as a new chemical plant violates health regulations. Last year our reviewer, Lorrie Moore, called the book "big, moving, rich with life and story."  THE SYSTEM: An Insider's Life in Soviet Politics By Georgi Arbatov. Times Books/Random House, $14. This memoir by a former member of the Soviet Communist Party's Central Committee illustrates both the inner workings of the state and his own difficult position as a reform-minded politician. For anyone re-evaluating Mr. Arbatov's country, this book "would be a good place to begin," Stephen F. Cohen said here in 1992. Another look at the former Soviet Union is to be found in MOLE, by William Hood ($12.95), restored to print by Brassey's (U.S.)/Macmillan. The author, a former C.I.A. official, tells the story of Pyotr Popov, who is said to have been the first Soviet intelligence officer to turn informant. In 1982 our reviewer, Philip Taubman, said the book offers "the kind of mounting tension one would expect to find in the best novels about espionage."  INHERIT THE MOB By Zev Chafets. Fawcett Crest, $5.99. What would you do if your deceased uncle, a Jewish gangster, left you several lucrative but tainted businesses? William Gordon, a formerly law-abiding journalist, decides to go for it. In 1991 our reviewer, Vincent Patrick, called this novel a "hilarious, warm look at one of organized crime's oft-neglected ethnic groups."  HEMINGWAY: A Life Without Consequences By James R. Mellow. Addison-Wesley, $15. This biography focuses particularly on Ernest Hemingway's years in Paris, where he first built his reputation as writer and renegade. The author's knowledge of the 1920's is "so deep that even the most casual sentence about Hemingway's life conveys related knowledge of his surroundings," Deirdre Bair said here in 1992.  THE CHILDREN OF MEN By P. D. James. Warner, $6.50. The world is coming to an end, not through nuclear war or the greenhouse effect, but as the result of a disease that has rendered all men sterile. This plot is as much about metaphysics as it is about science fiction, resulting in "two worthy adventures . . . for the thoughtful reader," Walter Wangerin Jr. said here last year.  CROSSING BLOOD By Nanci Kincaid. Avon, $10. This first novel portrays two families in Tallahassee, Fla., in the 1960's, one black, one white, bound by proximity, employment and the growing affection between one man's daughter and the other's son. Last year our reviewer, Stephen Stark, called it "a fresh, honest and complex portrait of love and hate."  LAUREL GRAEBER</p>
