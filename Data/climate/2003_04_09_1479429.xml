        <p>Alcoa and Archer Daniels Midland have agreed to settle federal air pollution complaints by upgrading smelters and other factories at a cost the government estimates at $700 million, one of the companies and people familiar with the case said today.</p>
        <p>Alcoa, one of the largest emitters outside of power plants of sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain, said it had agreed to reduce its sulfur dioxide emissions at its aluminum smelting plant in Rockdale, Tex., by at least 95 percent, or more than 52,000 tons a year. It will also reduce nitrogen oxide emissions, which contribute to smog, by 90 percent, or 17,000 tons a year.</p>
        <p>Alcoa has 12 months to make the reductions.</p>
        <p>Alcoa will pay $1.5 million in fines and contribute $2.5 million to funds that support habitat conservation and reducing school bus exhaust emissions.</p>
        <p>Archer Daniels Midland agreed to eliminate more than 60,000 tons of emissions of carbon monoxide, particulate matter, organic volatile chemicals and other pollutants from 42 plants in 17 states at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars, people familiar with the case said.</p>
        <p>In addition, the company will pay $4.5 million in penalties and more than $6 million to support environmental projects.</p>
        <p>Joe Martyak, a spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency said the settlements were ''significant.'' ''We are not slacking on enforcement.''</p>
        <p>Older power plants that modernize are required to install new pollution controls under the New Source Review provision in the Clean Air Act. Work that is considered routine maintenance, however, does not trigger the increased pollution controls. The law also extends to emissions sources like Alcoa's Rockdale smelting plant, which produces 291,009 tons of aluminum per year.</p>
        <p>Alcoa upgraded its Rockdale smelting plant in the 1980's but had not installed modern pollution controls, according to a lawsuit filed by a local advocacy group.The state and federal government opened investigations after the suit was filed.</p>
        <p>As a result of the scrutiny, Alcoa announced in July 2001 that it planned to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by 50 percent and sulfur dioxide emissions by 90 percent.</p>
        <p>The settlement increased the reduction. ''It's an extension to a commitment that we made previously,'' said Kevin Lowery, a spokesman for Alcoa.</p>
        <p>The Bush administration is reviewing the New Source Review regulations, saying the law as written is a disincentive to modernize plants. A change proposed by the E.P.A. last December would significantly broaden the definition of ''routine maintenance,'' a move that has drawn criticism from state governments and environmental groups.</p>
        <p>''The agency has a real split personality on this issue,'' said Eric Schaeffer, the former head of civil enforcement at the E.P.A. who resigned last year partly because of frustration over the administration's handling of enforcement in New Source Review cases. ''The enforcement side and the Department of Justice proves that the law works pretty well. The policy side and the air division keep on rolling it back.''</p>
