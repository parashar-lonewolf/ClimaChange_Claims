        <p>BRITISH scientists who sent a research plane and helicopters through the smoke rising from the oil fires in Kuwait say serious smog could build in the region in the coming months, but there is little evidence to support dramatic warnings about possible long-term climatic effects.</p>
        <p>The research team, the first airborne expedition through the smoke, released some of its conclusions last week and said part of its data would need several more weeks of laboratory analysis. But the initial findings have provided the most detailed picture yet of the severe pollution over Kuwait and the region.</p>
        <p>Before the war, some scientists warned that smoke from extensive oil fires could disrupt the monsoon rains and cause large-scale drought in India. Others said gases and soot could affect global weather systems in such a way that temperatures would drop and cause a minor "nuclear winter."</p>
        <p>For climate change to take place far away from the fires, scientists believe, sufficient soot and gases would have to rise more than eight miles into the air and enter the stratosphere. Jet streams could carry them around the world and they could also help deplete the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>Yet after 57 hours of flying across and above the smoke plumes, the British researchers said they found that most of the smoke and soot were staying close to earth.</p>
        <p>"Our great relief is that not much of it is rising," said Dr. Geoff Jenkins, who headed the research flight. "We found some wisps of smoke at 20,000 feet but no important quantities. The clouds mix the material, they lift some of it but remove much of it in the rain." The main plume, he said, typically hovers not much higher than 8,000 feet. That means, he added, that the pollution will have regional but not global effects. 'It Was Pretty Horrific'</p>
        <p>In the Kuwait region, the scientists said, conditions exist for serious photochemical smog to build up in the lower atmosphere in the coming months as rains and winds diminish and the sun further heats the air.</p>
        <p>The group from Britain's Meteorological Office spent 10 days in March flying at different altitudes and distances from the burning wellheads, which were set afire by Iraqi troops before they were driven out of Kuwait. The research team, the first to fly through the smoke, used British helicopters and a C-130 Hercules plane, rigged with lasers, filters and samplers to study the air.</p>
        <p>Describing some of his experiences by telephone, Dr. Jenkins said: "It was pretty horrific. Over large areas the instruments recorded no sunlight whatsoever in the middle of the day. We had to put the lights on in the craft."</p>
        <p>Their measurements included the density of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides, both of which are "greenhouse" gases that can trap heat and warm the earth. But they said it was too early to calculate how much of these gases and how much soot and sulfur were being spewed into the air because there is still wide disagreement about the volume of oil being burned.</p>
        <p>Kuwaiti officials have said more than six million barrels a day are going up in smoke from the more than 500 burning wellheads. But a number of scientists and oil industry experts believe this figure is inflated. Researchers at the Max Planck Institute of Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany, put the figure at three million barrels a day.</p>
        <p>New evidence collected by the British team, however, appears to corroborate earlier, still lower, forecasts. "Our analyses seem consistent with the original estimates that 1.5 million barrels per day are being burned," said Paul Mason, a member of the team. Whatever the rate of burning, atmospheric specialists agree that the huge fires will accelerate the buildup of carbon dioxide, the most important of the greenhouse gases. But the specialists add that the Kuwaiti fires, whether burning 1.5 million barrels a day or four times that amount, in themselves will not drastically change the global temperature.</p>
        <p>The burning of oil and other fossil fuels produces carbon dioxide, which traps heat in the atmosphere. Scientists fear that rising levels of the gas will cause the global temperature to warm catastrophically.</p>
        <p>Around the globe, some 50 million barrels of crude oil products are being burned every day, generating some 40 percent of the world's total carbon dioxide emissions. Burning a further 1.5 million barrels per day would therefore increase the carbon dioxide due to oil by three percent.</p>
        <p>While that is a lot compared with what any one individual might generate, "in terms of the global picture, it's pretty negligible," said Dr. James E. Hansen of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, an expert on global warming. "If you were adding a few percent and were going to do it indefinitely," he said, "then it would be something to be concerned about. But obviously, they're going to turn off those wells as fast as they can."</p>
        <p>Environmentalists argue nonetheless that this increase is a serious setback, particularly at a time when industrial nations are fighting over international agreements to cut back their emissions by a few percentage points. Soot-Stained Snow</p>
        <p>The high levels of sulfur dioxide, a main cause of acid rain, that were registered on the British flights appeared to confirm earlier reports from weather specialists who have followed the smoke's trajectory by satellite. These specialists said oil fires were causing acidic rain at distances of 1,200 miles from Kuwait and had reached the Black Sea to the north and Pakistan to the east. Last week snow stained with oily black soot was found on the Himalayan slopes of Kashmir in northern India. Most at risk, according to meteorologists, are the agricultural regions of Iraq and Iran, where highly acidic rain can corrode forests and crops.</p>
        <p>Researchers on the British plane said they collected evidence of pollution from the fires as far as 1,000 miles from the blazing wells. "At 1,000 miles from the source the smoke becomes like serious smog levels in Europe," said Mr. Mason, "at 100 miles it is very bad."</p>
        <p>Maximum concentrations were found at about 70 miles from Kuwait at an altitude of about 6,000 feet. Here Dr. Jenkins said the group recorded 1,000 parts per billion of sulfur dioxide, "which is some 20 times higher than what you expect in a polluted city." Nitrogen oxide was recorded at 50 parts per billion. "That's very high," said Dr. Jenkins, "perhaps 10 times higher than what you would find downtown."</p>
        <p>He said that the level of soot -- 30,000 particles per cubic centimeter -- was 30 times higher than what you would expect in a polluted city. "This is not necessarily what people are breathing," he added, noting that the density could be much lower near the ground. Small Is Dangerous</p>
        <p>One crucial discovery was the small size of the soot particles hovering in and above the plume, something that is worrying Dr. Paul Crutzen, a leading atmospheric chemist. He is among the specialists who believe that the Kuwaiti smoke can still have more than just regional effects.</p>
        <p>"It's the soot that is the most dangerous here," said Dr. Crutzen, who works at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz, Germany, "the finer the soot particles, the more dangerous." The large particles easily fall out by their own weight, he explained, but the small ones can stay up for a long time, rise higher and block sunlight. Assuming that the fires burn for two or three years, he said, "if 1 percent of that soot reaches the stratosphere, we cannot exclude a drop of temperature of one or two degrees centrigrade throughout the Northern Hemisphere." If 5 percent reaches that high, he said, such a drop will be more likely and will have an effect similar to that of a big volcanic eruption.</p>
        <p>Dr. Crutzen and other scientists said that soot and nitrogen oxides, like chlorofluorocarbons, could deplete the earth's protective ozone layer in the stratoshere. To do that, they said, a sufficient volume of soot would have to rise at least 12 miles, where the concentration of ozone is highest. But "you're not going to get it into the stratosphere from the Kuwaiti fires," said Dr. Mario Molina of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, an expert on atmospheric chemistry and ozone depletion.</p>
        <p>Atmospheric specialists who have long worked with the effect of fires on the environment dispute the widely held view that the Kuwaiti fire is the worst fire disaster seen so far. Dr. Crutzen and other specialists said that every year the burning of tropical forests and fields throws three times or more carbon dioxide into the air than the Kuwaiti well fires are likely to produce in a year.</p>
