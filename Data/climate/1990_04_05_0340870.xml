        <p>LEAD: Industrial companies across America reacted with varying degrees of pessimism to the clean-air legislation passed by the Senate on Tuesday. They are resigned to paying billions of dollars in additional pollution-control costs but warn that those costs will be passed on to consumers.</p>
        <p>Industrial companies across America reacted with varying degrees of pessimism to the clean-air legislation passed by the Senate on Tuesday. They are resigned to paying billions of dollars in additional pollution-control costs but warn that those costs will be passed on to consumers.</p>
        <p>The bill, which appears likely to be the basis of the first Federal clean-air law since 1977, would require auto makers, chemical manufacturers, steelmakers and coal-fired power plants, among others, to make substantial investments in equipment and processes to lower their pollution. The Senate bill now goes to the House of Representatives, where several industries hope for amendments that will make it less stringent. But environmentalists see the House debate as an opportunity for strengthening the legislation. The version of the bill now in a House committee would impose stricter limits in some areas.</p>
        <p>The Administration estimates that the cost will be $20 billion a year. Yet some corporations said that more than money is at stake. They said they were not sure how to meet the new requirements at any reasonable cost. Here are the viewpoints of four industries on the legislation.</p>
        <p>The Auto Industry</p>
        <p>Jump in Cost Seen For Consumers</p>
        <p>Auto industry representatives said yesterday that the measure approved by the Senate included standards for the equipment that controls tailpipe emissions that would stretch the limits of their technology and cost consumers a minimum of hundreds of dollars extra for each car.</p>
        <p>But those interviewed stopped short of saying the Senate was placing impossible limits on the industry. However, vigorous lobbying in Congress for a less restrictive bill appeared certain, they said.</p>
        <p>Thomas Hanna, president of the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association, an industry trade group, said, ''It's an extraordinarily tough bill but it's the best we thought we could get from the Senate, given where some of the parties were.''</p>
        <p>The provision in the Senate bill that seems most worrisome to auto makers is a requirement that makes standards for auto tailpipe emissions applicable for 10 years or 100,000 miles starting in 1993, doubling the current longevity standard. The tailpipe standards would reduce oxides of nitrogen 60 percent from the current level and hydrocarbons by 40 percent.</p>
        <p>A second round of tailpipe-emission reductions in the year 2004 would halve the 1993 level.</p>
        <p>''Anything mechanical deteriorates, especially something underneath a car,'' said Rob Liberatore, a government relations specialist for the Chrysler Corporation, referring to a car's catalytic converter, which removes pollutants from engine emissions. ''To engineer a system that can last this long it has to meet very, very low standards when it's new so it still meets the limits after a decade.'' Can Standards Be Met?  Automotive engineers are reluctant to estimate the cost of a pollution-control system that meets the 100,000-mile standard, but Mr. Liberatore said the additional rare metals and other costs certainly would amount to ''several hundred dollars'' a car, which auto makers say they would pass on to consumers.</p>
        <p>''We're not sure if we can meet the standard,'' said Donald R. Buist, director of emissions and fuel economy for the Ford Motor Company. ''If we can't, we'll have to go back and see the Government again,'' he said, referring to the mid-1970's, when auto makers obtained a relaxation of regulations because they were not able to meet pollution-control standards.</p>
        <p>Auto makers are also wary of a provision in the Senate measure that requires special canisters for cars to trap fumes lost during refueling. The canisters would add $80 to $100 to the cost of a car and the auto makers say they pose a safety hazard in an accident. Instead, the Big Three prefer the solution used in California: a special hose at each gas tank that catches the vapors and collects them underground.</p>
        <p>But the auto makers said their picture was not entirely bleak. The Senate failed to impose a fuel-economy provision mandating that each car maker's fleet reach an average of 40 miles a gallon, up from the current 27.5 miles a gallon. That much-discussed proposal is aimed at reducing carbon-dioxide emissions thought to contribute to global warming, by cutting the consumption of gasoline. Auto makers have warned that it could force an end to big-car production. The Senate also did not mandate the production of alternative-fuel cars like those that would burn methanol, which the Environmental Protection Agency had favored.</p>

        <p>The Utilities</p>
        <p>Delay Is Sought On Cleaner Coal</p>
        <p>The bill approved by the Senate is intended to reduce acid rain by cutting 10 million tons a year of sulfur dioxide from the smokestacks of power plants, half of it from generators in the Midwest that burn high-sulfur coal. In addition, companies would be limited after the year 2000 to the amount of sulfur dioxide they emitted in 1985.</p>
        <p>''We are extremely disappointed,'' said Thomas S. Ayres of American Electric Power, based in Columbus, Ohio, which serves seven million people in seven states and is in some years the nation's largest purchaser of coal. The company has not had time to analyze the effect of this legislation, he said, but an earlier proposal that would have cut the same amount of sulfur dioxide would have cost $750 million a year. That would be equal to nearly 15 percent of revenues.</p>
        <p>If electric prices increased by a similar percentage, the company's residential rate would rise to about 7 cents a kilowatt-hour, which is still a penny under the national average price. Defending the proposed cleanup, William Reilly, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said yesterday that costs would rise for the utilities that are the biggest polluters. But he said that even after the increases, ''almost everywhere, the rates in those areas will be competitive with adjacent areas that have met the performance standards already.''</p>
        <p>But coal-burning utilities think the standards could be met at less cost if Congress would delay action while cleaner ways to burn coal are developed. The alternative is to put ''scrubbers'' on existing plants, which are costly to build and require vast amounts of electricity to run.</p>
        <p>Another controversial point is the choice of 1985 as the base year. At the Edison Electric Institute, a trade association in Washington, Mary Kenkel, a spokeswoman, said that a recession in the industry in 1985 reduced electricity generation - and thus emissions - to unusually low levels.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kenkel and others also complain that the Senate legislation is inflexible. For example, at the Centerior Energy Corporation, which serves more than a million customers in northern Ohio and relies on coal to meet 70 percent of its load, Lee Bailey, a spokesman, complained that the proposed law sets a limit for each plant. ''If we could average over our entire system, it would give us the possibility of scrubbing our two biggest coal units to meet the goal,'' he said. That would be just as effective as putting less-efficient scrubbers on each plant and it would be cheaper, he said.</p>
        <p>Complaint on Standards</p>
        <p>But not only the most polluting utilities have objections. At Wisconsin Electric, which is 60 percent coal-fired, Lisa Berman, a spokeswoman, said the company had reduced sulfur dioxide emissions by 46 percent since 1980, and already meets the standards that would come into effect by 1995 under the legislation voted by the Senate. ''We want to have credit for what we've done so far,'' she said.</p>
        <p>For a second round of reductions, taking effect in 2000, Wisconsin Electric would have to switch to lower-sulfur coal or install new equipment or both, at a cost of $125 million to $135 million, she said, raising rates by 8 to 13 percent. The company might retire one of its older coal-fired plants, she said.</p>
        <p>Utilities facing growth also complained. At the Florida Power and Light Company, where a growing population is pushing up demand by 4 percent a year, company executives say that the choice of 1985 is especially unfortunate for them because in that year all four of their nuclear plants ran very well, with little time lost for refueling. As a result, they got 35 percent of their power from that sulfur-free source, a percentage that they do not think they can match now.</p>
        <p>What the Florida utility would have to do under the proposed legislation is buy the right to emit more pollutants than it did in 1985, according to Gary G. Mehalik, a spokesman. A section in the proposed legislation would allow a company in the Midwest to clean up a coal plant even more stringently than the law requires and ''sell'' the difference. If, for example, a utility in Illinois cut emissions by 1,000 tons a year more than was required, it could sell to Florida Power the right to emit that 1,000 tons.</p>
        <p>But he said, ''Our interest is in having our customers protected from having to pay for cleaning up other people's plants.''</p>

        <p>The Chemical Industry</p>
        <p>Permit Process Called a Nightmare</p>
        <p>Chemical manufacturers and the trade groups representing them reacted warily yesterday to the clean-air legislation passed by the Senate. ''There's no doubt we are talking about millions of dollars of spending requirements but we haven't made an estimate of the impact on us because so much could change,'' said David Graham, Dow Chemical's environmental issues manager in Washington.</p>
        <p>Chemical manufacturers, most of which are major consumers of electricity, say the bill's provisions to reduce acid rain will drive up their energy costs. But the biggest direct impact will come from the provisions dealing with toxic emissions. The most frequently cited areas of concern were the rules for when a permit is necessary, the requirements for applying the best technology available to control the release of toxic chemicals and the process for establishing how high a residual risk for cancer-causing emissions would be acceptable after such control technology had been applied.</p>
        <p>Trade groups say the provisions governing the permit process in the Senate bill may be a nightmare, especially for smaller companies. Companies must not only apply for permission to use processes that emit toxic chemicals but also must seek new permits every time the equipment is altered.</p>
        <p>''We are concerned with the Draconian enforcement measures, especially things like jail terms and massive fines for paperwork violations,'' said Ronald Lang, executive director of the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers Association. ''Smaller companies don't have four lawyers backing people up to make sure everything is mailed.''</p>
        <p>Impact on Innovation Feared</p>
        <p>Mr. Graham at Dow said the lack of priorities in the procedures for issuing permits meant that applications for new processes that a company needs to build a new plant or extend a product line might become tied up in piles of requests from other companies - even for something as small as permission to shift the route of a section of piping for routine maintenance. He said companies will be discouraged from making small changes, thus slowing the pace of innovation.</p>
        <p>More broadly, several manufacturers said they feared that the requirements that companies use the best available control technology would not be flexible enough to account for the huge variety of chemicals and processes for dealing with them. Standardizing the required technology could drive up expenses for some companies while producing few reductions in emissions.</p>
        <p>The bill refers the problem of how to calculate the impact of toxic air emissions on health to the National Academy of Science. At issue is what standards should be applied to residual emissions after industry has met the first-phase goal of cutting emissions by 90 percent. If Congress does not act within five years on the recommendations it receives on how to determine such standards, the provisions now in the bill apply. The chemical industry contends that the current criteria are unreliable and that if they are retained, plants may be needlessly threatened with closure.</p>
        <p>'Paying Lip Service'</p>
        <p>''By referring the matter to N.A.S. but not leaving the standard up to them, Congress is paying lip service to science,'' said Jeffrey Van, a spokesman for the Chemical Manufacturers Association.</p>
        <p>Chemical makers were pleased that the House version of the bill was stripped of numeric targets for residual emissions by Representative John D. Dingell's committee on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>A number of manufacturers said that some of the major costs in the bill would remain unknown until state and local regulators acted.</p>
        <p>Companies that use solvents to process chemicals into more than 700,000 consumer products, from shampoos to antifreeze, had mixed feelings about provisions reducing allowable solvent emissions. The Senate bill ordered a study of the contribution of solvents to depletion of ozone in the atmosphere and a 1 percent reduction in emissions, which was considerably milder than originally proposed, said Ralph Engle, president of the Chemical Specialties Manufacturers Association. The solvents provisions would also affect dry cleaners.</p>

        <p>The Steelmakers</p>
        <p>Rules Criticized As 'Arbitrary'</p>
        <p>With the passage of the Senate bill, the nation's major steel producers remain unsuccessful in their fight against provisions that would effectively prohibit the further use of coke ovens, the furnaces that convert coal to coke in the making of steel.</p>
        <p>The steelmakers are disturbed by a requirement that they eliminate virtually all emissions from coke ovens by the year 2020 and in the meantime adopt the best available emissions-reduction technology by 1995.</p>
        <p>Steel industry officials said that meeting the 1995 deadline would cost the industry about $5 billion. They added that there is no technology yet available that would eliminate emissions completely and that the bill's deadline of 2020 would effectively close most of the nation's coke ovens and lead to the loss of thousands of jobs. They maintain that the standard in the Senate bill - the risk of cancer to one resident in 10,000 in a community near a coke oven - is arbitrary.</p>
        <p>''The steel industry is opposed to the use of arbitrary, calculated risk-based standards for shutting down coke plants,'' said Walter F. Williams, chairman of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation.</p>
        <p>Philip X. Masciantonio, vice president of environmental affairs at the USX Corporation, which operates the nation's largest steel company, said the evidence of the extent of the health risk posed by coke ovens was far from conclusive. He said USX had spent more than $250 million in recent years to reduce emissions from its coke ovens.</p>
        <p>A number of steel companies in Europe and Japan are developing processes for the manufacture of steel that bypass making coke. But Milton Deaner, president of the American Iron and Steel Institute, described as nonsense the opinion that in a few years the industry would have a steelmaking process that would do away with coke ovens.</p>
