        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In "Why Dump Recycling?" (Op-Ed, May 29), Barry Commoner makes a good point: we could recycle more than we do. However, he is mistaken in his belief that waste-to-energy plants -- which burn garbage as fuel -- are in economic competition with recycling facilities.</p>
        <p>As a major supplier of both, we firmly believe that an integrated solution of recycling, composting of leaves and yard waste and, finally, burning the rest in modern waste-to-energy plants, makes the most sense.</p>
        <p>Recycling and reuse of materials is attractive because it saves precious natural resources. Composting of leaves and yard waste can produce good fertilizer and soil enhancers. Finally, burning waste not recycled or composted produces clean electricity without using precious oil reserves. (One ton of garbage is the equivalent of a barrel to a barrel and a half of oil.) In addition, according to a recent study conducted by a leading, independent consulting engineer, air emissions of organics, sulfur dioxide and particulates from a modern waste-to-energy plant are actually less than from an equivalent oil-fired or coal-fired facility.</p>
        <p>Economically, recycling and composting are not in competition with waste-to-energy plants simply because the major recyclable materials (glass, aluminum, iron and steel) don't burn. They are more valuable as raw materials for new products.</p>
        <p>As for the economics, recycling, composting and waste-to-energy all cost money. The sale of recycled materials does not pay the full cost of sorting and baling. Electricity sales do not pay the full cost of burning.</p>
        <p>Good quality office paper and clean dry newsprint can be recycled more cheaply. Paper contaminated by food waste can have a useful second life as renewable energy. R. J. SWIFT Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer Foster Wheeler Power Systems Clinton, N.J., June 4, 1991</p>
