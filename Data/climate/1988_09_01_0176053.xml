        <p>The Environment Yesterday in Michigan, George Bush started to talk about something serious. Diversions about the Pledge of Allegiance or Mr. Dukakis's alleged lack of patriotism were laid aside. Mr. Bush addressed the mounting evidence of deterioration in the environment and promised to convene a global conference to discuss remedies. That's a welcome beginning to debate on a strangely neglected issue.</p>
        <p>This has been a miserable summer. People gag on ozone smog as bad as in any year on record. They can't escape the heat by visiting the seashore because the beaches are polluted. They hear warnings that even hotter years lie ahead because of the global warming caused by the predicted greenhouse effect. All the stranger that until now, neither candidate has made concern about the state of the environment a major issue.</p>
        <p>At his acceptance speech in Atlanta, Mr. Dukakis devoted a single sentence to the environment, saying he would rather protect it than polluters. Mr. Bush, in New Orleans, promised to stop ocean dumping, ''reduce the harm'' done by acid rain and have the F.B.I. nab discarders of medical waste.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately the new environmental problems are more serious and more complex than the old ones. The threat to the life-protecting ozone layer in the stratosphere requires international agreement to stop manufacture of chlorofluorocarbons. There's already a pact to cap production of the chemicals, but further vigorous efforts by the U.S. are needed to prepare countries for the next step -phasing the chemicals out altogether.</p>
        <p>The feared greenhouse effect, a warming of the globe caused by pollutant gases like carbon dioxide, is by no means a certainty. But it makes sense to get insurance with anti-greenhouse measures that are worth taking in their own right. These include more efficient use of energy, protection of tropical forests and development of a new and safer generation of nuclear power plants. As with the ozone threat, this is another policy that requires international cooperation.</p>
        <p>There's an equally complex problem nearer home, the pollution of coastal waters. Medical waste and ocean dumping are its least serious aspects. The root cause is the growth of population along the coasts and Great Lakes shorelines. A huge flux of pollutants drain into the shallow coastal waters and estuaries - sewage, industrial pollutants, acid rain, airborne toxics, the debris from city streets, and pesticide and fertilizer runoff from farms.</p>
        <p>Long Island Sound, Chesapeake Bay and San Francisco Bay are already casualties of this relentless torrent of filth. Their waters, vital breeding grounds for many marine species, are being robbed of life by poisons and blooms of algae.</p>
        <p>The hot summer has made this steady degradation of the environment suddenly more evident as it touches people's lives. Mr. Bush acknowledged many of these concerns in his speech at Lake Erie Metropark yesterday. Neither candidate has an outstanding record of accomplishment on the environment. Mr. Dukakis delayed cleaning up Boston harbor. As chairman of the Task Force on Regulatory Relief, Mr. Bush even opposed standards for auto efficiency and the removal of lead from gasoline.</p>
        <p>But the new groundswell of concern makes the environment an issue worth capturing - for itself and for the advantage it might bring to the candidate who can best articulate the crises and answers.</p>
