        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It is ironic that you would use the oil-spill disaster of the tanker Exxon Valdez in Alaska's Prince William Sound as an argument in favor of opening the Shoreham, L.I., nuclear power plant (''The Energy Vandals,'' editorial, April 20). If radiation were the color and texture of oil, there would be no operating reactors, because citizens would quickly realize that radiation releases occur routinely, not just in accidents.</p>
        <p>Yes, as you say, the country has to take steps to counteract the greenhouse effect and acid raid. And we agree that adding new oil-fired plants on Long Island is not the answer. But using nuclear power simply trades one environmental calamity for another. There are alternatives.</p>
        <p>If you had spent one-tenth the effort reporting recent, startling advances in photovoltaic technology that you have spent on cold fusion (for which, even if verified, practical applications are still decades away), your readers would know that solar power is no longer a dream. Indeed, researchers at Sandia National Laboratories have produced electricity from photovoltaics at an efficiency level comparable to oil or nuclear plants. This means that large-scale solar-power plants may be in place before the end of this century. And there is no more limitless source of energy than the sun.</p>
        <p>There is considerable progress on other energy fronts as well. For example, Brookhaven National Laboratories on Long Island is having success with methods of burning coal that do not produce carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>The implementation of a meaningful energy-efficiency program on Long Island could meet capacity requirements cheaper and more quickly than either Shoreham or new oil-fired plants. There are plenty of scientists and engineers available to assist New York State in developing such a program.</p>
        <p>The nuclear industry would have us believe that our only choices are nuclear power or oil, coal and the greenhouse effect. That simply isn't true. Long Islanders already know that. Scrapping Shoreham isn't folly; indeed, it can be a strong step toward creating an environmentally sound energy future that does not leave a legacy of carbon dioxide or radioactive waste. MICHAEL MARIOTTE  Washington, April 30, 1989</p>
        <p>The writer is executive director of the Nuclear Information and Resource Service.</p>
