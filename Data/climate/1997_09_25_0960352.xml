        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your Sept. 23 Science Times article on the Sun and global warming says that ''only in the last decade or so'' have researchers begun to tie solar variations to climate shifts on Earth. But scientists have believed for centuries that solar variations drive the climate. This is why Charles Abbot initiated a program to monitor solar irradiance from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory a century ago.</p>
        <p>My colleagues and I, in a paper you reported on (news article, Aug. 22, 1981), found that the Sun may account for many of the ups and downs of climate in the past century. But the measurements show that the long-term trend of solar energy absorbed by Earth is less than 1 watt per square meter averaged over Earth. This compares with a heating by anthropogenic greenhouse gases of about 2.5 watts, which could increase to 5 or 6 watts in the coming century.</p>

        <p>It is this fact -- that forces unleashed by human activities are competing with and perhaps exceeding those of nature -- that scientists have drawn to the attention of decision makers.</p>
