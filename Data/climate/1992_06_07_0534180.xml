        <p>The United States, under fire at the Earth Summit for perceived foot-dragging on treaties intended to protect the planet's climate and its biological diversity, is trying to restore its standing, at least partly, by leading a drive to save the world's forests.</p>
        <p>But opponents of the forests initiative are suspicious of the Bush Administration's motives, and the prospects that the initiative will advance at the summit, or that it will do much to repair Washington's environmental reputation, are in doubt.</p>
        <p>Coming into Rio, the Administration found itself at odds with much of the rest of the world over treaties to control global warming and preserve the world's plant, animal and microbial species. On forests, however, the Administration has taken the lead in pushing a position that is endorsed by many environmental groups and by other industrialized nations.</p>
        <p>But in doing so, it has fallen afoul of the vehement opposition of developing countries for which forests are a major economic asset. These countries assert that while they believe in protecting forests, they are theirs to do with as they please. They accuse the United States and other industrialized countries of attempting to coerce them on the issue for domestic political gain. And they bridle at what they see as an attempt to abridge their sovereignty by countries that long ago cut down their own trees for profit but now want to place the main burden of global forest conservation on countries struggling for economic survival.</p>
        <p>"We are certainly not holding our forests in custody for those who have destroyed their own forests and now try to claim ours as part of the heritage of mankind," Ting Wen Lian, a Malaysian diplomat who has emerged as the developing countries' chief spokeswoman on the issue, said as the forest negotiations began this week. Her country and the United States are the two largest timber-exporting nations in the world. Forests as Global Asset</p>
        <p>The United States argues that forests, especially tropical forests, are being destroyed at an alarming rate in the developing world and that the planet as a whole will be the loser. Forests, it argues, are a global asset that help regulate the climate by absorbing heat-trapping carbon dioxide and are the repository of a major portion of the world's living species.</p>
        <p>William K. Reilly, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency and chief of the United States delegation to the Earth Summit, has announced that "the principal priority of the United States at this conference is better management and conservation of the world's forests." Armed with a commitment from President Bush to step up foreign aid for forest protection and an announcement that the United States was abandoning clear-cutting in its national forests, Mr. Reilly attempted to put new weight behind longstanding Administration efforts to secure agreement here that an international treaty on forests be negotiated and signed after the Rio summit.</p>
        <p>But Ambassador Ting dismissed President Bush's offer of new money as irrelevant to the forest negotiations here.</p>
        <p>Despite the developing world's opposition, Britain and Germany have been leading an effort to integrate President Bush's announcement of $150 million a year in new funds for forest preservation into a broader initiative involving a number of countries. U.S. Seen as Obstructionist</p>
        <p>The United States has been seen by much of the rest of the world as an obstructionist on the key issues of global warming and biological diversity.  The Bush Administration successfully sought the adoption of commitments to reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases that is weaker than most other industrialized countries wanted, although Administration officials contend that the resulting treaty is a prudent first step in view of the scientific uncertainties over global warming.</p>
        <p>The United States plans to sign the climate treaty, but not the treaty on protection of species. While it supports the central conservation features of the biodiversity treaty, it opposes other aspects relating to patent protection, regulation of biotechnology and the mechanism for transferring funds from rich to poor nations for conservation purposes.</p>
        <p>Earlier, in pre-summit negotiations, it had been hoped that a forest treaty could be signed here along with those on global warming and protection of species. But developing countries would not hear of it, and now environmental groups fear that even the statement on forest principles may not survive Rio.</p>
        <p>"They're really in trouble on this document," said William Mankin, a forestry expert for the Sierra Club. "They don't have enough time to do this."</p>
        <p>Negotiators working on a wide range of summit issues, including forests, must complete work by Wednesday so that documents may be prepared for the three-day summit phase of the conference beginning on Friday. Defending Forestry Record</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly argues that despite such high-profile issues as the cutting of old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest, the United States record on forestry in the last century is good, if not a model.</p>
        <p>As in many other industrialized countries, Americans cut down their forests at a rapid rate and in an uncontrolled fashion until about a century ago. Since then, the Americans argue, the United States has built up a vast body of expertise on how to manage forests so that they can be exploited economically while maintaining an extensive forest cover. There are more forests in the United States now than a century ago, and their total volume has increased markedly, through growth and reforestation, in the last decade.</p>
        <p>One goal of the Americans and Canadians is the adoption of the principle that the sustainable use of forests should be governed by international guidelines on forest management.</p>
        <p>"We want to be measured by internationally accepted standards," said Jagmohan Maini, a forest official in the Canadian Government. "We will meet or exceed any such standards."</p>
        <p>Canada is a principal ally of the United States on the forestry issue. Many developing countries, said Mr. Maini, "are reluctant to recognize the global role of forests." Moreover, he said, "some of them are suspicious of our motives, which is very unfortunate. It shows we have failed."</p>
        <p>Indeed, Ambassador Ting said in a statement here this week that she understood that "the almost obsessional anxiety to have a forest convention" is driven by concerns that have nothing to do with forests or trees, but rather mainly by the desire of developed countries "to appease their public opinion and thus get electoral mileage out of forests."</p>
        <p>Environmentalists said the present draft of the statement of forest principles is so weak as to constitute a step backward. It falls far short, they say, of a 1991 World Bank prohibition on providing funds for logging in primary tropical rain forests and an international agreement recently reached to confine the trade in tropical timber, by the year 2000, to materials derived from sustainably managed forests.</p>
