        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The Environmental Protection Agency report on the health risks from dioxin is welcome (news article, Sept. 14). Dioxin, which is a probable cause of cancer and of developmental disorders, is largely produced from the combustion of such chlorine-containing substances as plastics. Therefore, the main source of dioxins is incinerator smokestacks. In addition, incineration releases other pollutants and also contributes to global warming.</p>
        <p>Yet instead of outlawing incinerators, worldwide experience suggests that it is better to create a recycling-friendly economic environment. This is achieved by mandating that newspapers be printed on recycled paper and that soda be sold in recycled bottles.</p>
        <p>Once such laws take effect, a market develops for used newspapers and soda bottles, and consequently they disappear from regular garbage. The combustible fraction in municipal waste drops to the point where the garbage can no longer be burned, and therefore incineration is phased out.</p>
        <p>Worldwide experience also shows that when regulations treat the dioxin-containing fly-ash from incinerators as toxic waste, resulting disposal costs tend to work against incineration and in favor of recycling.</p>
        <p>It can be concluded that if the proper regulations exist, economic forces will support recycling. On a per-ton basis, recycling in populated areas will cost half as much as landfilling and one-third as much as incineration. In addition, the recycling industry creates low-skilled jobs and reduces pollution.
