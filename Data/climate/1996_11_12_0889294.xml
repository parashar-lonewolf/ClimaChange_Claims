        <p>THE idea is to fertilize the sea with iron, creating such a bloom of sea plants that they gulp down tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and curb the buildup of this climate-warming gas.</p>
        <p>Long derided as foolish and politically dangerous, the idea has now been put to the test after years of foot dragging and has given strikingly good results, stirring hot debate over whether ecological tinkering might help save the planet from climatic disaster.</p>
        <p>The test was conducted southwest of the Galapagos Islands in the Pacific Ocean, which is a fairly barren area biologically. Over a region of 28 square miles, a team of scientists slowly poured into the sea 990 pounds of iron, which is thought to be a limiting nutrient in such unproductive regions.</p>
        <p>Almost immediately, the waters bloomed with the tiny plants known as phytoplankton, and did so over more than 200 square miles, turning the sea from blue to green.</p>
        <p>No scientist has criticized the experiment publicly, but experts are at war over whether the test simply sheds new light on marine ecology or points to an important way to battle the effects of global warming.</p>
        <p>Dr. Adam Heller, a chemical engineer at the University of Texas at Austin who has promoted the fertilization idea in Washington, hailed the explosive rise in ocean productivity as ''very significant, terribly significant.'' Dr. Heller said in an interview: ''We now have some way to cope with global warming should it become a problem. I wish we had more ways.''</p>
        <p>But detractors of such global engineering say its prospect offers a false hope that threatens to encourage polluters and undercut international accords meant to curb emissions of carbon dioxide, which is released into the atmosphere by the burning of gas, oil, coal and wood and is considered a main culprit in global warming.</p>
        <p>''As a scientific experiment, these results are fascinating,'' said Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, chief scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, a private group in New York. ''But as a potential solution to global warming, they have limited if any value, as far as our current understanding goes.''</p>
        <p>Fierce side debates are also developing over the cost of a program -- iron is cheap but megatons would be needed -- as well as its possible benefit of stepping up the sea's productivity and enhancing fish harvests.</p>
        <p>Both opponents and friends of sea fertilization tend to agree that at best, its widespread use would probably cut atmospheric carbon dioxide by 6 percent to 21 percent, not enough to end the problem but potentially sufficient to dent it.</p>
        <p>And all sides agree that the overall impact of an iron-seeding program on the ocean's ecology is riddled with uncertainties, especially for the sea's deeper ecosystems, of which little is known. In short, the cure might turn out to be worse than the disease.</p>
        <p>Advocates of the iron-seeding idea say such uncertainties, are no reason to soft-pedal it, especially given the threat of climate change and its attendant upheavals. Years of serious research lie ahead, they say, including exploring the natural history of iron fluctuations in the sea, which some scientists now speculate may be linked to the onset of the ice ages.</p>
        <p>''It's much too early to have a policy debate,'' said Russell Seitz, an associate of the Olin Center for Strategic Studies at Harvard University.  ''Despite this, the issue seems to been born politicized. Witness the rush to criticize the hypothesis in the early 1990's before the experiment was even done. Given the extent of our ignorance, and the stakes, I'm astonished to see polemics getting the better of science.''</p>
        <p>Part of the problem lies in the differing agendas of scientists and engineers. In general, scientists devote themselves to studying nature and unraveling its secrets, while engineers use science to rearrange nature in the service of humanity.</p>
        <p>Periodically, the two groups have been at loggerheads, the tensions rising steadily in the last few decades as a new kind of visionary has begun to dream of global countermeasures to climatic ills, envisioning huge ecoengineering projects far beyond the engineer's usual domain of making new kinds of computers and space vehicles.</p>
        <p>Remarkably, the current battle of the ecoengineering war centers on one of nature's smallest organisms, phytoplankton, which are ubiquitous through the sea, though their numbers vary widely, depending on local levels of nutrients.</p>
        <p>In coastal waters rich in agricultural runoff and human sewage, their numbers can swell into the range of 100,000 per drop of water, turning the sea cloudy and brown or  soupy green. Far from shore, however, phytoplankton dwindle as low as about 1 per drop, and in consequence these waters are usually deep blue.</p>
        <p>Since phytoplankton are the most important of the sea's primary producers, trapping the abundant energy of sunlight and so becoming the foundation of the ocean's food chain, the biological productivity of each region of the sea depends on how many phytoplankton it supports.</p>
        <p>A longstanding mystery of oceanography is that of why phytoplankton levels vary so widely, and can be low even in regions rich in nitrogen and phosphorus, the principal nutrients of plants. Seas that are low in phytoplankton but high in primary nutrients account for about 20 percent of the ocean surface.</p>
        <p>Beginning in 1986, Dr. John H. Martin, an oceanographer at the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories in California, proposed that low iron levels might account for the poor productivity. His idea was widely dismissed, even though scientists have long known that iron is vital to the health of most animals and plants, and that iron deficiency is a serious problem in many kinds of crops.</p>
        <p>Among other things, iron aids photosynthesis by helping to move around the subatomic particles known as electrons, which play a leading role in trapping sunlight's energy.</p>
        <p>Despite skepticism, careful experiments in the laboratory and measurements at sea suggested that Dr. Martin's thesis was right. By 1988, with public fears growing because of the threat of global warming, Dr. Martin proposed that the fertilization of unproductive areas of the sea with thousands of tons of iron might fix the climatic problem.</p>
        <p>''Give me half a tanker full of iron,'' he told colleagues, ''and I'll give you another ice age.''</p>
        <p>The idea languished until 1990, when the National Academy of Sciences, which advises the Federal Government, endorsed a test. But financing was slow to materialize, and many scientists and ecologists criticized the idea as an incentive for polluters.</p>
        <p>In June 1991, the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography issued a public statement that urged ''all governments to regard the role of iron in marine production as an area for further research and not to consider iron fertilization as a policy option that significantly changes the need to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Sallie W. Chisholm and Dr. Francois M. M. Morel, both of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, commented in an article accompanying the statement, ''The 'Geritol Solution' to global warming has been squelched for the time being, but it would naive to think that the issue will not come up again.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Martin died in June 1993, months before the first experiment that tested his iron hypothesis at sea. That experiment, in the Pacific some 300 miles west of the Galapagos, was ambiguous. A single dose of iron briefly raised phytoplankton levels, but the test ended prematurely when the fertilized patch sank beneath waters of lesser density.</p>
        <p>The experiment was redone in May and June 1995 by 37 scientists from the United States, England and Mexico, only this time the iron was dispersed in three infusions over a week to insure a more sustained release into the sea's surface. The test was financed by the National Science Foundation and the Office of Naval Research.</p>
        <p>The fertilized patch lay some 800 miles west of the Galapagos and had an area of 28 square miles. As detailed in four reports in the Oct. 10 issue of the journal Nature, the effect was immediate and striking.</p>
        <p>The sea exploded in a frenzy of phytoplankton growth and reproduction involving trillions of organisms, with the effect reaching its maximum extent some nine days after the start of the experiment and extending over an oceanic area that had expanded to some 200 square miles. The explosion was monitored mainly by measuring levels of chlorophyll, the green pigment of plants involved in the process of photosynthesis. Over all, the iron produced more than 2,000 times its own weight in plant growth, an impossible feat for any fertilizer on land.</p>
        <p>''Within one week, about two million pounds of phytoplankton had grown,'' said Dr. Kenneth H. Coale of Moss Landing, one the authors.</p>
        <p>At the same time, levels of carbon dioxide in the sea water plunged more than 15 percent as the expanding jungle of tiny plants soaked up the gas. Since the atmosphere and the sea constantly trade the gas through mixing and diffusion, the explosive growth had a large effect on that exchange as well.</p>
        <p>Scientists say the experiment may have pulled more than 2,500 tons of carbon dioxide from the waters before the fertilized patch was broken up by ocean currents. By comparison, human pollution pumps billions of tons of carbon into the air each year.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bruce W. Frost, an oceanographer at the University of Washington in Seattle who commented on the study in Nature, said that an extrapolation of such fertilization to a much larger area would have ''only a small effect'' on future levels of global atmospheric carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>In contrast, Dr. Kenneth S. Johnson, a chemical oceanographer at the Moss Landing laboratory who participated in both iron experiments, hailed the experiment as basically opening a new chapter in humanity's relationship with the planet.</p>
        <p>''This shows that you could cause an ice age, which is a pretty profound statement,'' he said in an interview. ''It has lots of implications.''</p>
        <p>Ecoengineers focus their musings on the Southern Ocean around Antarctica because it is the largest part of the global sea that exhibits the phenomena of high nutrient levels and low iron. It is already a highly productive region, teeming with krill and the whales that feed on the tiny crustaceans.</p>
        <p>But scientists say the Southern Ocean, if enriched with iron, would become even more productive and would also become an enormous sponge for carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere. Such a move would require the dumping of millions of tons of iron into the sea every year, more or less continuously.</p>
        <p>Among the hotly debated questions are at what cost, and to what effect. A number of studies have suggested that such enrichment would lower the range of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by 6 percent to 21 percent.</p>
        <p>But Dr. David J. Cooper, a member of the experiment team at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, said the 21 percent value was out of date and that most recent studies had found that the drop would be around 10 percent.</p>
        <p>Dr. Cooper, an opponent of ecoengineering, accused its supporters of exaggerating the possible effects.  ''Scientists haven't been honest about it,'' he said, suggesting that some were playing up the idea as a way to get financing for experiments.</p>
        <p>Mr. Seitz of Harvard, on the other hand, accused the experiment team of bending over backwards to play down the test's results, fearful of upsetting global political agendas.</p>
        <p>''If this approach proves to be environmentally benign,'' he said, ''it would appear to be highly economic relative to a Luddite program of declaring war against fire globally,'' a move that might cost many trillions of dollars in lost development and revenue.</p>
        <p>Friends and foes of the idea agree that the big ''if'' in all this is the proposal's ecological impact, which is wholly unknown and vigorously disputed. Some scientists foresee a flowering of the oceanic food chain, ultimately producing more fish, while other see the oceans dying or significantly disrupted.</p>
        <p>All agree that more research, perhaps decades of it, would be needed to flesh out the idea's repercussions.</p>
        <p>''It's a mine field,'' Dr. Johnson of Moss Landing said of the topic. ''Everybody is stepping gingerly.''</p>
