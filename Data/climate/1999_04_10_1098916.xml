      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial notes Federal study has found that acid rain has spread its poisons all around country; hopes findings will broaden political support for Sen Daniel Patrick Moynihan's bill that would reduce airborne pollutants that create acid rain; says study could also provide further justification for Clinton Administration efforts to tighten pollution controls on power plants and other sources of nitrogen oxides</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>When people think of the ravages of acid rain, they tend to think mainly of dead and dying watersheds in the Northeastern United States, particularly those in New York's Adirondack Mountains, where hundreds of highly acidified lakes and streams can no longer sustain aquatic life. But an exhaustive Federal study has now concluded that acid rain has spread its poisons far and wide, damaging sensitive watersheds in the Southeastern United States and in ecologically significant areas of the West like the Sierra Nevada, the Cascade Range and some parts of the Rocky Mountains.</p>
        <p>These findings are disturbing. But they could also recruit new allies to the unfinished struggle against acid rain. They could broaden political support for legislation sponsored by New York's Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan that would reduce the airborne pollutants -- sulfur and nitrogen -- that create acid rain. They could also provide further justification for the Administration's efforts to tighten pollution controls on power plants and other sources of nitrogen oxides.</p>

        <p>When people think of the ravages of acid rain, they tend to think mainly of dead and dying watersheds in the Northeastern United States, particularly those in New York's Adirondack Mountains, where hundreds of highly acidified lakes and streams can no longer sustain aquatic life. But an exhaustive Federal study has now concluded that acid rain has spread its poisons far and wide, damaging sensitive watersheds in the Southeastern United States and in ecologically significant areas of the West like the Sierra Nevada, the Cascade Range and some parts of the Rocky Mountains.</p>
        <p>These findings are disturbing. But they could also recruit new allies to the unfinished struggle against acid rain. They could broaden political support for legislation sponsored by New York's Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan that would reduce the airborne pollutants -- sulfur and nitrogen -- that create acid rain. They could also provide further justification for the Administration's efforts to tighten pollution controls on power plants and other sources of nitrogen oxides.</p>
        <p>The study was produced by a Federal panel, the National Acidic Precipitation Assessment Program, established 20 years ago at Mr. Moynihan's urging to study a problem about which little was known. In 1990 Congress confronted the problem for the first time, ordering coal-fired utilities and other industries to halve their emissions of sulfur dioxide, the main cause of acid rain, over the next decade. Nitrogen was also regulated by the 1990 law because it causes smog, a serious health hazard. But not until the mid-1990's was nitrogen recognized as a significant contributor to acid rain as well.</p>
        <p>The report shows that emissions of sulfur dioxide have declined sharply and at relatively low cost, due mainly to the 1990 law and an innovative financial system under which pollution credits are traded on the open market. The report also suggests that the law and subsequent regulations aimed at reducing nitrogen oxides from power plants should have a positive effect, though the evidence so far is sketchy.</p>
        <p>But the problem is far from solved, and in some areas may be much worse than anyone thought. If present trends continue, the report warns, about half the Adirondacks' 2,800 lakes and streams will be too acidic to support life by the year 2040. The San Gabriel Mountains near Los Angeles are ''saturated'' with nitrogen, or close to it -- meaning that excess nitrogen is seeping into nearby lakes and streams. Watersheds in other Western ecosystems are similarly afflicted.</p>
        <p>The report thus provides a solid argument for Mr. Moynihan's bill, which has two New York Republican sponsors in the House, John Sweeney and Sherwood Boehlert, but few signatures in either the House or Senate. The bill would provide for a further 50 percent cut in sulfur emissions beyond those mandated by the 1990 amendments -- resulting in a 75 percent cut from 1990 levels by 2005. It would also require cuts of 70 percent in nitrogen oxides from power plants by 2005, and establish an emissions trading system similar to the successful sulfur dioxide scheme.</p>
        <p>The 1990 law focused mainly on Midwestern power plants, but the Moynihan bill would cover plants nationwide, and would therefore not put utilities in any single region at a competitive disadvantage. The national scope of the bill should also appeal to Congressmen who until now had believed that acid rain was a local problem, of interest only to Northeastern environmentalists. The new Federal report says it is nothing of the sort.</p>
