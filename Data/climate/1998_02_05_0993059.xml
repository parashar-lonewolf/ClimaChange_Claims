        <p>FOR Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, it was a good news-bad news kind of day.</p>
        <p>During the last year and a half, Mr. D'Amato has expended a great deal of effort,  or at least television advertising dollars,  building up a record as an environmentalist. On Tuesday, environmentalists offered their assessment of that record based on his actual votes.</p>
        <p>At the National Press Club, the League of Conservation Voters presented its score card for 1997. Following an annual tradition, the group assigned every member of Congress a score between zero and 100, depending on how their votes had affected the environment.</p>
        <p>The good news for Senator D'Amato was that his score had skyrocketed, increasing eightfold over the previous two years.</p>
        <p>The bad news was, it was still lousy.</p>
        <p>With a 29 percent rating, Mr. D'Amato had the lowest number of any Senator in the Northeast, Republican or Democrat. His enormous improvement mostly reflected that in 1995 and 1996 he had received scores of 7 and 0.</p>
        <p>''We would have hoped that Senator D'Amato's newfound enthusiasm might have resulted in a higher score,'' the leagues president, Deb Callahan, observed diplomatically. ''We encourage him to keep on working to improve that score.''</p>
        <p>Mr. D'Amato declined to comment on his rating directly, either to contest the premise of the tally or to defend his votes. Instead, a spokeswoman for the Senator, Lisette McSoud Mondello, responded with a statement that sounded a lot like Mr. D'Amato's advertising copy.</p>
        <p>''From fighting to stop the devastating effects of acid rain on New York's forests and lakes, to winning millions in Federal funding for clean air buses, to being one of the first Republicans to fight for tougher clean air standards, Al D'Amato is proud of his efforts to protect New York's environment,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The statement demonstrates yet again what is clearly Mr. D'Amato's strategy as he heads into a re-election campaign. The Senator is not going to contest the merits of his credentials as an environmentalist. He is simply going to declare that he is one.</p>
        <p>For genuine environmentalists, the Senator's strategy presents an awkward challenge. Clearly it is tempting for them to make an example of him; the whole point of a group like the League of Conservation Voters, after all, is to provide a check on politicians who portray themselves as tree huggers while voting in favor of clear-cutting. In many ways, Mr. D'Amato is the perfect poster boy for the art of green- scamming.</p>
        <p>AT the same time, it may be smart for environmentalists to handle the Senator a little bit more gently. Even it if is only a bit of election-year environmentalism, a 29 percent score is certainly better than zero.</p>
        <p>Hoping to capitalize on his strategic enthusiasm for green causes, a group of environmentalists sought out Mr. D'Amato's help earlier this year when a set of new, tougher standards for soot and smog were under assault in the Senate. Mr. D'Amato obliged with a strongly written letter in favor of the tougher standards.</p>
        <p>''Senator D'Amato did show real leadership on clean air, and it made a difference,'' said Sharon Buccino, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington. But practically in the same breath, Ms. Buccino said that Mr. D'Amato was now busy undoing his own work. The Senator was pressing for a utility deregulation bill that would, she said, have a devastating impact on the same clean air standards he defended last year.</p>
        <p>In the end, it may not be the environmentalists who speak most clearly about Mr. D'Amato's record. Standing outside the conservation league's news conference on Tuesday, two representatives from a group called the League of Private Property Voters passed out a rival score card reflecting the values of its sponsors, a long list of timber, mining and ranching associations.</p>
        <p>For his votes against public land and resource protection, the group awarded Mr. D'Amato a healthy score of 57.</p>
