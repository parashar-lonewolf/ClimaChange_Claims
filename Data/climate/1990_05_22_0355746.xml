        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It is no doubt true that British and French aerospace experts could now build a long-range supersonic transport plane (SST) superior to the present Concorde in many ways, including twice the passenger capacity and a 50 percent greater range, as indicated in your May 8 news article.</p>
        <p>But it is equally true that such a plane would have many strikes against it. Its take-off noise would be unacceptably loud by a factor of at least 10. Its sonic boom would be unacceptable over land; therefore the planes could not serve inland cities unless the overland portions of the flights were made at subsonic speed. Yet it is near-impossible to design a plane that performs well both at supersonic speed and at subsonic speed. The release of combustion gases at high altitude would further damage the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>The world is being buried under almost insoluble technical and financial problems. The proposed SST would aggravate some of them, solve none.</p>
        <p>WILLIAM A. SHURCLIFF</p>
        <p>Cambridge, Mass., May 8, 1990</p>
        <p>The writer, a retired honorary research associate in physics at Harvard University, founded the Citizens League Against the Sonic Boom, which opposed the Boeing SST, a project dropped in 1972.</p>
