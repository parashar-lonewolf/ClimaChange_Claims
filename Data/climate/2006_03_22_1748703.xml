        <p>European and Asian companies are paying more attention to global warming than their American counterparts. And chemical companies are more focused on the issue than oil companies.</p>
        <p>Those are two conclusions from ''Corporate Governance and Climate Change: Making the Connection,'' a report that Ceres, a coalition of investors and environmentalists, expects will influence investment decisions.</p>
        <p>The report, released yesterday, scored 100 global corporations -- 74 of them based in the United States -- on their strategies for curbing greenhouse gases. It covered 10 industries -- oil and gas, chemicals, metals, electric power, automotive, forest products, coal, food, industrial equipment and airlines -- whose activities were most likely to emit greenhouse gases. It evaluated companies on their board oversight, management performance, public disclosure, greenhouse gas emissions, accounting and strategic planning.</p>
        <p>The report gave the chemical industry the highest overall marks, with a score of 51.9 out of a possible 100; DuPont, with 85 points, was the highest-ranking American company in any of the industries. Airlines, in contrast, ranked lowest, with a score of 16.6; UAL, the parent of United Airlines, received just 3 points.</p>
        <p>The study gave General Electric, American Electric Power and Cinergy among the highest scores in their industries. But over all, it concluded, American companies ''are playing catch-up'' with international competitors like BP, Toyota, Alcan, Unilever and Rio Tinto.</p>
        <p>''Dozens of U.S. businesses are ignoring the issue with 'business as usual' responses that are putting their companies, and their shareholders, at risk,'' said Mindy S. Lubber, president of Ceres and director of the Investor Network on Climate Risk, a group whose members control a total of $3 trillion in investment capital. ''When Cinergy and American Electric Power are tackling this issue, and Sempra and Dominion Resources are not, that should be a red flag to investors.''</p>
        <p>Art Larson, a Sempra Energy spokesman, took exception to Sempra's score of 24. He said that Sempra, based in San Diego, had been ''aggressive in promoting energy efficiency and procuring renewable energy sources,'' and that ''in the area of environmental responsibility, Ceres seems to give more weight to words over action.'' Hunter Applewhite, a spokesman for Dominion, a big electric utility in Richmond, Va., that scored 27, said the company had no comment on its ranking.</p>
        <p>Members of the Investor Network said they would take the report's conclusions seriously. ''We need to continue to press poor-performing companies to clean up their act,'' said California's state treasurer, Phil Angelides, who is on the board of two pension funds that collectively manage more than $300 billion in assets.</p>
        <p>Connecticut's state treasurer, Denise L. Nappier, who administers a $22 billion investment fund, lauded the report as an ''unprecedented window into how companies most affected by climate risk are responding at the board level, through C.E.O. leadership and strategic planning.''</p>
        <p>The report does show progress since 2003, when a much smaller Ceres study concluded that most American companies were ignoring the threat of climate change. Since then, Ceres notes, Chevron Texaco has invested $100 million in developing cleaner fuels, Ford Motor introduced the first American hybrid car, American Electric Power has committed itself to ''clean coal'' technologies and G.E. has introduced its Ecomagination program stressing ''green'' products. And many companies including Dow Chemical, Anadarko Petroleum and Cinergy have board committees that oversee the curbing of greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>''More U.S. companies realize that climate change is an enormous business issue that they need to manage immediately,'' Ms. Lubber said.</p>
        <p>Still, the top-scoring company, with 90 points, was BP, a British company that has said it will invest $8 billion in solar, wind and other clean-energy technologies in the next decade. ''BP understands that all companies must work to reduce their carbon footprint, starting with fossil fuels,'' Ms. Lubber said.</p>
