      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Both houses of the New York State Legislature have approved an innovative measure aimed at reducing the amount of sulfur dioxide, the chief cause of acid rain, that drifts into New York from coal-burning power plants in Midwestern and Southern states. By itself, the measure may not do much to reduce windblown sulfur emissions and the acid rain they cause. But New York's effort to stem this pollution assault from other states sends a timely message to the White House and to Congress that the federal acid rain program is not doing the job it was intended to do, and badly needs strengthening.</p>
        <p>One source of New York's troubles is a generally sound piece of Federal legislation, the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments, that sought to harness market forces to reduce air pollution through a trading system for pollution allowances. Companies that reduce their sulfur dioxide emissions below federal requirements can sell their unused pollution allowances to companies that find it cheaper to buy such credits than to modernize their facilities. Over all, the system has been a success, resulting in cleaner air nationwide while reducing the cost of compliance.</p>

        <p>Both houses of the New York State Legislature have approved an innovative measure aimed at reducing the amount of sulfur dioxide, the chief cause of acid rain, that drifts into New York from coal-burning power plants in Midwestern and Southern states. By itself, the measure may not do much to reduce windblown sulfur emissions and the acid rain they cause. But New York's effort to stem this pollution assault from other states sends a timely message to the White House and to Congress that the federal acid rain program is not doing the job it was intended to do, and badly needs strengthening.</p>
        <p>One source of New York's troubles is a generally sound piece of Federal legislation, the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments, that sought to harness market forces to reduce air pollution through a trading system for pollution allowances. Companies that reduce their sulfur dioxide emissions below federal requirements can sell their unused pollution allowances to companies that find it cheaper to buy such credits than to modernize their facilities. Over all, the system has been a success, resulting in cleaner air nationwide while reducing the cost of compliance.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, on a regional basis there have been serious glitches. For example, New York State's utilities, which are relatively clean because of strict state anti-pollution laws enacted in the 1980's, have done a brisk business selling credits to dirty Midwestern plants, enabling them to avoid cleaning up. Unfortunately for the lakes and streams in the Adirondacks, as well as other ecologically sensitive areas of the state, these Midwestern plants have returned the favor by sending their pollution back east on the prevailing winds.</p>
        <p>Under the bill, which Gov. George Pataki is almost certain to sign, any New York State utility that sells its pollution rights to dirty, coal-fired power plants in 10 designated Midwestern and Southern states -- plus the neighboring states of New Jersey, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Delaware -- would be subject to penalties that would negate any profit from the sales. Unfortunately, polluters in the South and Midwest will still be able to buy credits elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Even so, the bill sends an important message. If Congress wishes to maintain the integrity of the trading system, it will have to make it work all across the country. The best way to do that is to tighten the national cap on emissions, which in turn would force individual plants to lower their emissions. At some point, the market price for allowances would reach a level where companies would choose to spend money on actual controls rather than the credits that give them the right to keep polluting.</p>
        <p>There is legislation in Congress that would do just that. A bill sponsored in the Senate by Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Charles Schumer, both of New York, and in the House by New York representatives Sherwood Boehlert and John Sweeney, would require a nationwide 70 percent cut in sulfur emissions from 1990 levels, as opposed to the 50 percent cut required by the Clean Air Act. This week's action in Albany is important symbolically and may yield modest practical benefits. But the only sure way to get the kind of reduction needed to protect the Adirondacks is to impose a far stricter nationwide cap on sulfur emissions.</p>
