        <p>ANDREW SHAPIRO got the idea for the company he helped to start, GreenOrder Inc., from his younger brother's music club, the Wetlands Preserve in the TriBeCa neighborhood of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The club, popular in the 1990's, was dedicated to staying ''green,'' whether in its use of recycled paper products and energy-efficient light bulbs or its full-time environmental center. Between sets, patrons could sign petitions, say, to stop global warming or to bolster car-emission standards.</p>
        <p>But the club also had to work hard to stay green while remaining in the black, and it closed down in 2001 when its lease expired.</p>
        <p>''Through that experience,'' Mr. Shapiro said, ''I became passionate about one of the thorniest problems in business, which is: How do companies meet their goals for growth and profitability while also being environmentally responsible?''</p>
        <p>To offer solutions, he and Peter Shapiro, the brother who ran the music club, founded GreenOrder, a consulting firm that promotes environmentally friendly business practices, six years ago.</p>
        <p>The firm, based in Manhattan, started as a sort of ''green dot-com,'' he said, using the Internet to help companies procure products that were environmentally safe and energy efficient. Today, with a staff of 14, it works on some of the country's largest green commercial development projects.</p>
        <p>''Increasingly, companies are recognizing that how they manage issues related to energy and environment is key to their success as businesses,'' said Mr. Shapiro, 38, a former lawyer and journalist who attributes some of his love for what's green to summers spent at Camp Keewaydin in Salisbury, Vt. The camp was the subject of ''Camp'' (Warner Books, 2005), a memoir by Michael D. Eisner, the former chief executive of the Walt Disney Company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shapiro has also served as a consultant to the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, a joint venture formed by New York City and New York State after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, to coordinate rebuilding in the area.</p>
        <p>GreenOrder worked with Silverstein Properties on the new 7 World Trade Center, which was the first office building in New York City to be given a ''gold'' certification by the U.S. Green Building Council, a nonprofit group that has a ratings system for buildings that meet certain design criteria. Green buildings typically incorporate recycled or renewable materials and minimize energy use with features like fluorescent light bulbs or photovoltaic cells, which convert sunlight to electricity.</p>
        <p>At 7 World Trade Center, which opened in May, construction vehicles used ultralow-sulfur fuels and special filters to minimize air pollution in the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>The 52-story building conserves water by using rainwater for cooling and to irrigate a small park nearby, and saves energy with steam-to-electricity turbine generators and variable-speed fans. It also lets in more natural light, further conserving energy, and has improved air quality through filtration.</p>
        <p>Environmentally friendly buildings can sometimes cost more upfront, Mr. Shapiro said, but the returns can be significant in the long run. ''You've got some of the biggest projects in the country today being built green,'' he said, ''and developers are doing that because they believe they're going to get a premium in selling the building or leasing it up at a higher rate.''</p>
        <p>The green features of 7 World Trade Center have become ''a huge hit with potential tenants,'' said Janno Lieber, a World Trade Center project director for Silverstein Properties. Nearly 60 percent of the building's 1.7 million square feet of space has been leased or committed.</p>
        <p>GreenOrder has eight employees with science or engineering degrees, and two have certification from the Green Building Council. Mr. Shapiro himself is not a scientist, and his role in development projects typically is to be a business-strategy consultant rather than a technical consultant.</p>
        <p>''Andrew's talent is to help businesspeople understand the business benefits of environmental investments, and also to speak to the environmental community about how businesses look at these issues,'' Mr. Lieber said. ''He's a strong bridge.''</p>
        <p>It took several years for Mr. Shapiro to develop that role. Initially, he had to go out in search of real estate customers. Tishman Speyer Properties and Vornado Realty Trust were two early clients.</p>
        <p>''I went to them and said, 'Look, we can make a business case for greening your properties,' '' Mr. Shapiro said. ''We worked on energy-efficiency projects for them. We took existing properties, did energy audits, swapped out lighting and HVAC'' -- heating, ventilating and air conditioning -- ''to cut costs with a low payback period.''</p>
        <p>Now, General Electric's real estate division, which owns about $47.5 billion in assets, has turned to Mr. Shapiro for advice on increasing property value through green design. He is now working on a building near Perth, Australia. Initially, G.E. hired GreenOrder in 2005 to conduct an environmental analysis of the company's products, including appliances and building materials, for a project known as ''ecoimagination.'' Products that comply with environmental standards created by GreenOrder qualify for the ecoimagination stamp from G.E.</p>
        <p>That project has been highly successful because of Mr. Shapiro's pragmatic approach, said Lorraine Bolsinger, a G.E. vice president who leads the campaign.</p>
        <p>''He knows that in order for any of this to work, it has to have a business proposition,'' she said. ''To me, that is a rare find in the green realm, where there are people who believe you do things for altruistic purposes. That's very difficult for the people at any public company to get their heads around.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Shapiro is also consulting on a project proposed by the mall developer Robert J. Congel, a $2.6 billion complex of retail shops, restaurants and entertainment sites in Syracuse to be called DestiNY USA.</p>
        <p>The developers said that they plan to break ground by year-end, and they have begun selling $1.037 billion in ''green bonds,'' a low-cost financing program from the federal government that encourages developers to incorporate technologies that conserve electricity, reduce air pollution and use solar power.</p>
        <p>''I always think of it as part Disney World, part Mall of America, part Biosphere,'' Mr. Shapiro said of the Syracuse project. ''They want the whole thing to be powered without fossil fuels, so instead it's biomass and solar and wind.''</p>
        <p>Richard Pietrafesa, a managing director of DestiNY USA, said the aim is to show that environmentally friendly construction is financially feasible. Mr. Shapiro ''can take the geeky stuff and make it attractive to consumers,'' added Mr. Pietrafesa, who credits Mr. Shapiro with making him an advocate for environmental concerns.</p>
        <p>''If someone ever told me I'd be an environmentalist 10 years ago, I'd have blown smoke at them from my cigar,'' he said. ''But now I drive a Prius; I have a condensing furnace in my house; I have all fluorescent light bulbs; and I'm a candidate for the U.S. Green Building Council. And I attribute that to Andrew's infectious enthusiasm for this topic.''</p>
        <p>MR. SHAPIRO says he believes he has found his niche in business precisely because he is not an environmentalist in the traditional sense of being an outdoors enthusiast. Despite the childhood camping and regular trips to Aspen, Colo., where he met and married his wife, Nina Bauer, Mr. Shapiro said he considers himself a dyed-in-the-wool urbanite.</p>
        <p>''What I'm passionate about is an idea: how to convince businesses that being leaders in environmental performance will also make them leaders in business performance,'' he said. ''For me, it's more about testing a concept than a passionate sense that businesses should plant trees or save water.''</p>
