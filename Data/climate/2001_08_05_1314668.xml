        <p>In Warsaw, George W. Bush used a vivid figure of speech in responding to a question about European reaction to his plans for an American missile defense: ''I was very pleased to see how forward-leaning many nations were during our discussion.'' A week later, he repeated the compound adjective in answering a question from Peggy Noonan of The Wall Street Journal about global warming: Bush found a ''different attitude'' among European Union leaders, who were ''a little more forward-leaning'' about it.</p>
        <p>That word-picture of a crouch of cooperation, or a tilt toward tomorrow, appeals to him. On the eve of his second mission to Europe, asked about his desire to include in NATO the democratic countries nearest Russia, the president said, ''We ought to be very forward-leaning toward those countries.''</p>
        <p>What does this fast-spreading trope mean? Ari Fleischer, Bush's press secretary, uses it in the sense of ''premature'': ''I think it's just a tad forward-leaning to call that quite a 'proposal' at this time.'' George Tenet, the director of Central Intelligence, uses it to mean ''open,'' as in his core dump of five million pages of old classified documents: ''It reflects my commitment to be as forward-leaning as possible in releasing information that with the passage of time no longer needs to be protected.''</p>
        <p>A quite different sense is ''aggressive'': a former Justice Department prosecutor, asked by two Times reporters about the present reluctance to bring charges against Iranian officials in a major terrorist bombing case, demanded to know, ''Why haven't we been more forward-leaning on Iran?'' This picks up on an early definition by Morton Kondracke in a 1987 New Republic, holding that the Reagan National Security Council staff was peopled with hyperactivists: ''subordinates who were 'forward-leaning' -- bold, imaginative and aggressive.''</p>
        <p>Yet another meaning is ''advanced,'' as in Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania's applause for the Bush administration's ''forward-leaning 21st-century energy plan.'' Vice President Dick Cheney gave it a sense of ''eager'' when asked about his boss's appearance of remoteness from the press when relaxing on his ranch: ''We've been criticized for being too forward-leaning. Now you suggest maybe we're too laid-back.'' I have been bending over backward here to permit the reported usage to determine the hot modifier's primary meaning. Time now for a semantic judgment.</p>
        <p>The most widely understood sense of this compound adjective is the new sense of forthcoming. That old word's early definition as ''soon to appear'' has been largely eclipsed by upcoming, and a new meaning of the compressed ''to come forth'' has emerged of ''responsive, open, outgoing, cooperative,'' even ''a pleasure to do business with.'' For some reason, that happy extension of forthcoming is losing favor under the vogue onslaught of forward-leaning.</p>
        <p>Thus, the forthcoming (in the old sense) meaning of forthcoming (in the new sense) is ''forward-leaning.'' The fresh figure of speech racing through the lingo of the edge-cutting calls up the image of a runner straining ahead, the tilt of the body throwing weight forward to aid acceleration. That fine image will have its moment of popularity but contains the seed of its metaphoric destruction: if you lean forward far enough, you fall on your face.</p>
        <p>GUNMEN</p>
        <p>''President Boris Trajkovski,'' reported the Guardian correspondent in Skopje, Macedonia, ''vowed to continue the fight against the gunmen of the National Liberation Army.''</p>
        <p>In Belfast, The Associated Press reported that ''two gunmen fired shots at Catholic men smoking outside a community center.''</p>
        <p>''Three Palestinian militants were killed'' in an Israeli helicopter attack, reported ABC News. ''In apparent retaliation, Palestinian gunmen killed an Israeli yesterday and set off two car bombs.''</p>
        <p>Words have connotations. In the disputed territory known as the West Bank, an Israeli village is called a settlement, implying fresh intrusion; a small Palestinian town, even one recently settled, is called a village, implying permanence.</p>
        <p>A word that terrifies many fair-minded editors is terrorist; it connotes criminality. Because it is said that one man's terrorist is another man's ''freedom fighter,'' journalists have reached out for other nouns, like guerrilla, militant or paramilitary.</p>
        <p>The latest rush from judgment is gunman. In 1999, that word appeared once in the database I checked for every five uses of terrorist in connection with Israel; now it's running about one in two.</p>
        <p>Because the Associated Press stylebook has no specific entries on terrorist or gunman, I asked its editor, Norm Goldstein, about what went into the choice. ''Words like gunmen, separatist and rebel are often more precise than terrorist and less likely to be viewed as judgmental,'' he notes. ''We often prefer the more specific words for that reason.'' Nor does the Times stylebook have a guideline; its editors tell reporters to use ''the most accurate and impartial term, especially in cases where the political merits are disputed.''</p>
        <p>The United States Department of State has a guideline in Title 22 of the United States Code, Section 2656f(d): ''The term 'terrorism' means premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets'' -- that means civilian or unarmed military -- by subnational groups or clandestine agents, usually intended to influence an audience.''</p>
        <p>Gunmen may be a useful catchall for journalists who do not want to appear less than objective by applying that standard of political intent and noncombatant victim. But in avoiding one problem, it engenders another: ''Why do you suppose this gender-biased word is still in use?'' asks Isaac Moses of Cambridge, Mass. ''Perhaps the lesson that violence is a particularly male occupation is not one that we want to impart on our little boys.''</p>
        <p>In every other walk of linguistic life, sexism is being rooted out. Firemen are firefighters, policemen police officers, postmen mail carriers. But in current ultra-nonjudgmental parlance, there are neither terrorists nor gunwomen. A female terrorist using a gun goes by the name of gunman.</p>
