        <p>Sanford E Gaines letter says there is no sense in maintaining a moral stigma on emitting greenhouse gases, as Michael J Sandel argues on Dec 15 Op-Ed article, when what is needed is new power generating technologies; says waste gases from power plants are not the same as the toxic emissions that do deserve a moral stigma; cartoon (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Michael J. Sandel (Op-Ed, Dec. 15) invokes the moral argument against emissions trading in the context of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Maintaining a moral stigma on pollution makes sense for hazardous substances where polluters have choices for reducing the pollution. But global warming is not such a situation. Does Mr. Sandel really believe he is behaving immorally when he cooks his dinner, switches on a light or turns on a computer to write an Op-Ed article? These activities result in emissions of carbon dioxide. Or is it his utility that should be stigmatized, perhaps for not using nuclear power?</p>

        <p>To reduce greenhouse gas emissions, producers and consumers alike need to adopt new technologies. That's a perfect situation to use the power of the market. Mr. Sandel should reserve his moral outrage for those who don't even want the chance to buy the right to pollute because they refuse to accept that the planet can no longer afford cheap energy.</p>
