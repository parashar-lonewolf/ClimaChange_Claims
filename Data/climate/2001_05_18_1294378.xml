        <p>The Bush administration's energy policy recommends expanding world production of oil, especially in Latin America and Africa, while rethinking American support for sanctions against energy-producing nations and deepening links to resource-rich Canada and Mexico.</p>
        <p>The plan notes that the United States, which now consumes more than 25 percent of the oil produced worldwide, will find itself increasingly in competition for oil with rapidly industrializing countries like China.</p>
        <p>It largely recommends meeting that demand by improving American diplomatic ties and the overall business climate in certain countries, taking advantage of new technologies and bold construction strategies to develop unexploited fields and avoiding an international commitment on global warming.</p>
        <p>''We can strengthen our own energy security and the shared prosperity of the global economy by working cooperatively with key countries and institutions to expand the sources and types of global energy supplies,'' the plan says.</p>
        <p>Environmental groups criticized that strategy, saying it gives short shrift to conservation and energy efficiency and would encourage developing nations to add to pollution associated with climate change.</p>
        <p>The plan focuses on improving American access to oil, noting that the United States is virtually self-sufficient in all other energy resources. The document urges Washington to deepen its integration with Canada, the nation's largest energy trading partner, and Mexico.</p>
        <p>The plan urges federal support for a privately constructed natural gas pipeline to run from Alaska, across Canada to the mainland United States.</p>
        <p>The plan encourages exploration specifically in the Caribbean, Brazil and West Africa and the Caspian nations. It calls on federal officials to help clear obstacles to construction of an oil pipeline from Azerbaijan to the Mediterranean.</p>
        <p>Still, it predicts that Persian Gulf nations will supply as much as two-thirds of the world's oil in two decades and urges officials to seek a better investment climate in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Qatar and United Arab Emirates.</p>
        <p>The plan urges a comprehensive review of the nation's policy on sanctions, taking ''energy security'' into account. The oil-producing nations Iran, Iraq and Libya are currently under economic sanctions backed by Washington.</p>
