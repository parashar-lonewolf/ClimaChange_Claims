        <p>UNDER THE WHITE-HOT sky of a Delhi summer, a few thousand thin men in faded clothes and tattered turbans have been waiting several hours in the sun for a political rally. There is no spontaneity or joy here, however. The men and a few dozen listless women are mercenaries of a sort, trucked in from the neighboring state of Haryana on the promise of a few rupees or a free trip to town to provide a sea of faces and applause. The portable crowd belongs to Devi Lal, Haryana's political godfather and the Deputy Prime Minister of India. He's sitting in a shaded pavilion, surrounded by a dozen fawning politicians who are preparing to kick off their campaigns for national elections this week. They are served mango juice.</p>
        <p>On the ground, Devi Lal's people, dusty and thirsty and stuck there until the boss speaks, grow restless as speaker after speaker drones on. A few get up and shout for Devi Lal. They want the main event, but they are polite. Men with sticks tell them to sit down.</p>
        <p>Finally, Devi Lal himself -- a tall, imposing 77-year-old man with snowy hair, dressed as always in crisp white, from his starched kurta shirt to the pointed toes of his Ali Baba slippers -- finally moves to the microphone, three hours behind schedule. The crowd springs to life, applauds appreciatively and cheers lustily at the conclusion. Their job done, Devi Lal's people walk out on the next speaker, the country's Prime Minister, Chandra Shekhar.</p>
        <p>Devi Lal -- who fills his coffers with gold coronets and walking sticks of solid silver pressed upon him by constituents, and whose notorious son, Om Prakash Chautala, doesn't hesitate to send out goon squads to intimidate rival candidates -- is a symbol to many Indians of much that is wrong in a democracy that was once hailed as a model for the third world.</p>
        <p>No political party or institution is free of the taint of nepotism, criminality and violence, says a retired police official, S. K. Ghosh, in "The Indian Mafia," a provocative new book about organized crime and politics. "In return for a ring of security, our politicians have surrendered their powers to gangsters," says Ghosh, who served under both British and Indian administrations and is now director of the independent Law Research Institute of Calcutta. "As our rulers increasingly fail to redress fundamental economic and social problems, they have to take greater recourse to muscle power to keep the disenchanted masses in line."</p>
        <p>The idealistic country of Mohandas K. Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru is fast passing into history. A deeply troubled India is approaching this week's national election in a mood of cynicism and foreboding. Myths are being exposed and new problems are piling up for the world's most populous democracy, with 844 million people and more than half a billion eligible voters.</p>
        <p>Fifty years ago, Nehru argued convincingly for a secular, socialist and democratic state. After independence in 1947, he constructed a foreign policy based on "a special relationship" with Moscow and leadership of the nonaligned nations. Now these pillars of modern India are crumbling.</p>
        <p>In several respects, India's descent into confusion and despair mirrors that of its former superpower sponsor, the Soviet Union. Having relied heavily on Soviet experts and socialist theories of development, India now finds itself burdened with outdated technology and uncompetitive industries. The economy is strangled by inefficiency and corruption and saddled with high foreign debts, mounting budget deficits and inflation that soared to 17 percent last year.</p>
        <p>A nation of diverse ethnic and religious groups cobbled together by British colonialism, India now seems on the verge of being ripped apart by separatist movements and religious violence. Scores are killed daily in clashes between dissidents and security forces. To maintain order, the Government has been forced to rule three strategic border states virtually by martial law. But the harsh measures only breed stronger resistance.</p>
        <p>Indian democracy is being strained as never before by gangsterism and corruption, some of it tawdry. For example, a Supreme Court Justice is the subject of impeachment proceedings for, among other things, taking furniture from an official residence.</p>
        <p>Unlike the Soviet Union, India has yet to repudiate unequivocally its past policies, many of which stemmed from an anti-Western, anti-imperialist ideology that stressed development without dependence on multinational corporations or lending institutions. Even after the Soviet turn to the West, Indians still broadly support rules that tightly proscribe foreign investment.</p>
        <p>The future is not entirely bleak. Food production, one of India's greatest successes, remains strong, and famine is not even an issue (although malnutrition is). Efforts to privatize and decentralize the economy in the 1980's, while piecemeal, did contribute to a burst of growth, and the country has a considerable number of highly educated professional and technical workers. Finally, despite the strains, India remains a functioning democracy that is at least discussing the issues that, for now, paralyze it.</p>
        <p>Many people insist that the country, which has weathered crisis after crisis since its birth in 1947, will overcome these new tribulations in time. "The idea that this country is falling apart should not be taken seriously," says K. Natwar Singh, a former diplomat and parliamentary candidate of the Congress Party, now led by Nehru's grandson, Rajiv Gandhi.</p>
        <p>"It has serious problems, but we have the mechanisms, the institutions, the wisdom, the resilience," Singh continues. "The Indian national train won't derail. It might meet with an accident here and there, but it will come out of it."</p>
        <p>But some are less optimistic. "In terms of catastrophe theory, you can have a whole series of negative trends, and they can continue for some time in a stable body politic," says Prem Shankar Jha, an economist and adviser to Vishwanath Pratap Singh, the leader of the Janata Dal Party. "But then suddenly you come to a precipice, and you go over. That's the way things are developing in India just now."</p>
        <p>J. D. Sethi, an economist and former Government planner, wrote recently that "there is a view that India is one of those societies whose history is coming to an end." While not necessarily accepting so dim a view, he concluded: "Indian society is indeed being pushed into chaos from all directions. Above all, the norms of state behavior and societal values are collapsing."</p>
        <p>IT IS TWILIGHT IN Calcutta on a winter evening. In a park called the Maidan, the electric company has switched on an extravagant display of lights and water called the Fountain of Joy, and everybody wants to have a look. The traffic jam starts a mile away. Cars creep along a road winding through the park, circling the Victoria Memorial Plaza, engulfed by an ocean of humanity.</p>
        <p>Stop the car for a moment, and tiny hands reach up to beg; little barefoot bodies with bright eyes, who barely reach the window. An open taxi door invites a crowd of petitioners: the handicapped, slender mothers in dirty saris clutching bony babies with vacant stares, hustlers with myriad gadgets and services to sell.</p>
        <p>Somewhere in the background, the fountains play. But they are obscured by a tangle of carts and stalls, heaped with food and drink. Underfoot, the grass has turned to a slippery sea of mud and trampled garbage. The noise is as unremitting as it is deafening, from car horns to the spiels of the food hawkers to the cries of children.</p>
        <p>A park, a temple, a market, a city street, a bus stop -- there are few places in urban India where lives do not collide, few places to find privacy or silence. In India's largest city, Bombay, up to 5 million of the metropolitan area's 12 million people are living as squatters in overcrowded apartments, in condemned buildings, on pavements, along the shoulders of roads and on scraps of open land that have somehow escaped development, says Sharad Pawar, the Chief Minister of Maharashtra state.</p>
        <p>Ingenuity is squandered on survival. Outside the Taj Mahal Hotel, near the Gateway of India arch in Bombay's historic old harbor, children drag an exhausted, flea-bitten dog from the shade of a parked car and order it to stand on a pyramid of tin cans. Nearby, a woman holds an infant aloft on a pole, signaling to horrified visitors in the air-conditioned rooms above that they should throw money.</p>
        <p>In a country where, in 1988, 612 people were packed into each square mile (compared with 66 in the United States), dwindling natural resources must sustain a population growing by 18 million a year. But forests are disappearing as illegal logging goes on with the connivance of corrupt officials, and as millions of poor villagers cut millions of trees for fuel and cremation pyres.</p>
        <p>On the drive from the plains of West Bengal to the old British hill station of Darjeeling, the winding road that hugs the mountainside is showered with falling rocks, harbingers of landslides on slopes stripped of vegetation. Women trudge along, bent under heavy bundles of twigs and branches. Every year, they say, they walk farther for fuel. In Darjeeling, which once offered refuge from a pestilential climate, population growth has outstripped supplies of drinking water, and women with water pots hike miles up and down steep hills to distant streams and springs.</p>
        <p>The World Resources Institute, a Washington research group, lists India among the world's top five producers of greenhouse gases, which scientists believe are responsible for global warming. In addition to chlorofluorocarbons, India produces large amounts of methane, from solid-waste dumps, livestock and wet-rice cultivation, and carbon dioxide, from fossil fuels and deforestation.</p>
        <p>International experts estimate that no more than 10 percent of India can any longer be described as forested. In parts of some states, environmentalists report losses of up to 98 percent of old woodlands, some razed for plantation monocrops, often eucalyptus trees, which consume enormous quantities of water and soil nutrients. Silt from balding, eroding hillsides in the Himalayas is slowly filling in huge river basins, leading to catastrophic flash floods, particularly downriver in Bangladesh.</p>
        <p>Cities and industrial sites use rivers as sewers; excess fertilizer and pesticides from farms leach into canals and streams. Maneka Gandhi, Minister of State for the Environment and Forests in the last two Governments, says some of India's greatest rivers, among them the sacred Ganges and the Jamuna, are biologically dead and chemically lethal. To practically nobody's surprise, a plan to clean the waterways, launched with great fanfare in 1986, is falling behind schedule.</p>
        <p>According to a confidential report done for a foreign-aid organization, three-quarters of India's water supply is polluted, mostly by chemicals or bacteria. Air quality in big Indian cities now ranks among the worst in the world.</p>
        <p>Indian social scientists are concerned at the correlation of corruption, political violence and overpopulation with poor health and education as well as illiteracy -- especially among women -- in one group of backward northern states. In this explosive region -- from Rajasthan to Bihar, taking in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and part of Haryana -- almost every social indicator is a warning.</p>
        <p>The region, with more than 41 percent of the national population, has annual population-growth rates generally higher than the Indian average of 2.1 percent, according to the 1991 census. Literacy rates are considerably lower than the national average of about 52 percent. Only 38 percent of the people in Rajasthan and Bihar can read and write. Literacy rates among women are worse: 20 percent in Rajasthan and 23 percent in Bihar. In rural areas, the literacy rate among women routinely drops below 10 percent; in remote areas of Rajasthan, female literacy falls below 2 percent. Demographers say that high female illiteracy is one factor in the failure of family planning.</p>
        <p>While calling itself an industrial and technological nation, India has become the world's largest producer of illiterates and child laborers. With a population likely to overtake China's early in the next century, India has no effective national family-planning program. And, no matter what the law putatively requires, there is no compulsory education, even at the primary level, except in a few enlightened areas. A third of its children are born with irreversible malnutrition.</p>
        <p>"We are breeding a nation of morons," an Indian development expert said with a mixture of horror and grief.</p>
        <p>THE COUNTRY HAS no shortage of experts eager to tackle its social, environmental and economic problems. But they are consistently stymied by a legendary bureaucracy that, in addition to stifling initiative, often seems more concerned with presenting a picture of a working society than with actually building one. Bunker Roy, whose model rural community at Tilonia, in Rajasthan, became the inspiration for many villages in the semiarid region around it, wrote in The Times of India recently that "simply put, the politician, planner and bureaucrat are lying to the nation."</p>
        <p>Thousands of villages that are listed as having drinking water are in reality dry, Roy says, forcing villagers to walk miles for water. Wells may have been dug and pumps installed, he says, but once something breaks down, it's finished. The Government doesn't follow up and the people just walk away.</p>
        <p>"Primary-school teachers' quarters are constructed that are never occupied," Roy continues. Doctors who, on paper, are posted in primary health centers in rural areas are more than likely running private clinics in the neighborhood with Government equipment and medicines and collecting a Government salary to boot, he says.</p>
        <p>"Roads are constructed that are not supposed to last more than a year, so that they can be constructed every year and shown on the record as new roads," Roy says. "Villages fully electrified on paper have to make do with kerosene lamps."</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Shekhar, the head of the caretaker Government leading India into elections, draws attention to India's rural hospitals. "Most of the people are dying because of infection," he said. "In 500, 600 district hospitals, at least you could make one recovery room and one operating theater air-conditioned. Was it not possible in 40 years to do it if there was a will?"</p>
        <p>Lakshmi Chand Jain, 65, a follower of Mohandas Gandhi who holds Asia's highest prize for public service, the Ramon Magsaysay Award, recently told a New Delhi audience that 44 years of overly centralized Government have "stifled, if not almost snuffed out, the very breath of freedom."</p>
        <p>"We have handicapped millions of people without shooting them, without sending them to the gallows," he said. "The only skill considered necessary for them is the ability to stamp the ballot paper."</p>
        <p>In an interview in his closet-size office, where he directs a small business consulting company, Jain talks about the roots of this human crisis. He finds them in the administration of Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first Prime Minister.</p>
        <p>"The first error he made was to assume that the next phase of India's emancipation after the British left could be managed without first mobilizing the people and their resources and their energies and their imagination," Jain says. "On the landscape of India, Nehru mounted dams, power plants, steel mills, heavy industry -- all kinds of things that are a credit from a certain viewpoint. But he completely forgot that, apart from the land, there were the people also. The people's own participation -- that never came. Community development became an extension of the bureaucracy. As many of us pointed out at that time, there was probably some development in it, but there was very little community." Strong local government, the bedrock of American democracy, has never been cultivated in most of India.</p>
        <p>"In a society where people are in abundance, and the diversity is enormous from village to village, household to household, the mobilization of those people -- their local knowledge, their own resources -- has to be the first step," Jain argues. "In the present scheme it's not even the last step. So we have made our task, which was already very difficult by all reckoning, much more difficult than necessary."</p>
        <p>The drift away from the federal spirit of India's Constitution during 40 years of Congress Party rule, particularly under the regime of the late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, not only stifled regional growth but also helped to precipitate the separatist movements that India now faces in Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab and the northeastern state of Assam. Disaffected minority groups, which might have been pacified by greater autonomy, turned in their rage to revolution. "I've never known a time when the integrity of India was so much under strain," says Soli Sorabjee, a constitutional lawyer and former Attorney General of India.</p>
        <p>"Kashmir is now beyond solution," says Bharat Wariavwalla, a political and strategic analyst. "We might keep it by force, but mentally it is not a part of India." In prosperous and productive Punjab some disaffected Sikhs talk of returning to Pakistan, reversing the migrations of the 1947 partition, or even of creating a nation they would call Khalistan.</p>
        <p>Finally, suffocating central controls have dragged down an economy that was once the envy of much of the developing world. Slow growth and rising joblessness, in turn, are feeding much of the cynicism, unrest and separatism that threaten the nation today.</p>
        <p>"You're getting more desperate young men opting for everything from autonomy to secession in more and more parts of the country because they can't get jobs," says Prem Shankar Jha, the economist and political columnist. "They are unable even to get married. They haven't got homes to take their families to. They have no social relevance."</p>
        <p>Jha says corruption has been a natural outgrowth of a overcentralized economy, where business generally has to pay "commissions" to politicians and bureaucrats to smooth and speed the process. "Industrialists flock like bees to the honey pot," Jha says. "And the honey pot is Delhi."</p>
        <p>Rahul Singh, a columnist and former newspaper editor, thinks that official corruption has undermined the democratic system itself. "Democracy is in danger when the people become so disillusioned with their money-grabbing, cynical political leaders that any other system, even military rule, seems better," he wrote in The Indian Express. "We are close to that moment of peril."</p>
        <p>But when it comes to economic reform, India is caught in a snare of its own making. Many people advocate a loosening of central controls and the introduction of modern technology and management. But many other Indians remain suspicious of "imperialist" exploitation. And they cling to the myths, heroes and ideas that contributed to the glorious victory over colonialism.</p>
        <p>"The revisionist school of history is now in operation: dump Gandhi, dump Nehru," says K. Natwar Singh, the Congress Party candidate for Parliament, capturing a common sentiment. "They won't succeed," he insists. "You can't dethrone Gandhi. You can't take away Nehru's colossal achievement. He held this country together for 17 years."</p>
        <p>IN LATE MARCH, JUST as India was beginning to gear up for its 10th national election, disturbing reports of a lynching were emerging from a small farming town called Mehrana, about halfway between New Delhi, the national capital, and the city of Agra, home of the Taj Mahal. It was a grisly story, shocking in what it revealed about the brutality of village life and the persistence of violence and discrimination based on caste. The incident at Mehrana spoke to the torment that millions of Indians face daily because of their birth. It illustrates why many of them are for the first time in this election walking long miles under a searing sun, with a few</p>
        <p>chappatis</p>
        <p>-- flat Indian breads -- in a knotted cloth for nourishment, to sit attentively at rallies by politicians who promise a social revolution. These are not rent-a-crowd crowds.</p>
        <p>In Mehrana on March 27, sometime between midnight and dawn, three young people were hanged on a village tree by their relatives and neighbors, who then threw their bodies on a common funeral pyre. The victims were Roshini, a girl of 16, Brijendra, her 18-year-old lover, and Ram Kishen, 22, a friend who had tried to help them elope.</p>
        <p>The charge was not promiscuity, however, but breaking the taboo of caste. Roshini was a Jat, the dominant caste in the area -- and the caste of Deputy Prime Minister Devi Lal, a factor in the publicity this story has received. The two young men were Jatavs, a community of outcastes, or Harijans, "children of God" to Mahatma Gandhi. A Jat-dominated village council sentenced them all to death after Roshini vowed to remain with her outcaste partner.</p>
        <p>"A Jat girl marry a Harijan?" Roshini's mother told a reporter for the news magazine India Today, when asked whether it would not have been better that her daughter live as a pariah than die. "This may happen in towns, but not here."</p>
        <p>There are many such stories in rural India, particularly in the north. A reporter hears them everywhere: accounts of outcastes pulled off bicycles and beaten because they are required to walk through high-caste neighborhoods, or assaulted for entering Brahmin temples or killed for defying any number of discriminatory rules. A civil rights group in Andhra Pradesh recently found that roadside tea stalls were still routinely setting aside separate glasses for outcastes. All of this is against the law.</p>
        <p>The Hindu caste system is enormously complex, with thousands of subcastes grouped into four major divisions called varnas. At the top are Brahmins and Kshatriyas, the learned and warrior castes, respectively. They are followed by Vaisyas, the traders and merchants, and Sudras, laborers, servants and others who have low social status but are still in the system.</p>
        <p>Under them all are the outcastes, people considered impure and therefore untouchable, who do the lowliest jobs. Among them are the more than 600,000 Indian families who still make their livings emptying latrines and chamber pots, carrying away excrement in buckets on their heads. Another subcaste catches rats. Although the national census does not record caste, social scientists estimate that up to three-quarters of India's people are Sudras or outcastes.</p>
        <p>Caste affects everyone, including Indians who are not Hindus -- many of whom tried to escape the system by converting to Islam, Buddhism or Christianity -- and foreigners. On several occasions, I have been subtly but unmistakably served from separate dishes in Brahmin homes.</p>
        <p>Every political analyst calculates and writes about "the caste factor" in election campaigns. Groups like the Jats or the Yadavs, also a northern rural subcaste on the rise, function now as ethnic voting blocs do in American politics, giving a voice to previously powerless groups. The growing political influence of Devi Lal's rural Jat community is the most visible example.</p>
        <p>This year, the pervasiveness of caste discrimination has been dragged out of the shadows and made an issue by two politicians. One is the former Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh, a high-caste Rajput who is campaigning on the theme of social revolution -- achieved primarily through affirmative action in Government hiring -- as a prerequisite to development.</p>
        <p>The other, Kanshi Ram, is an outcaste who says he is tired of knocking at the door of power and waiting for handouts from parties led by Brahmins. Ram's hero and his party's spiritual leader is the late Bhimrao Ambedkar, an outcaste who was educated in law at Columbia University, under the patronage of an enlightened maharaja, and who was chosen by Nehru to head the committee that wrote India's constitution.</p>
        <p>Ram's party won its first three seats in Parliament in 1989. This year he has been courted by almost all the major political organizations, which are eager to share his potentially huge reservoir of votes through an electoral alliance. Ram's party has already cut deeply into the traditional lower caste and outcaste "vote banks" of Gandhi's Congress Party.</p>
        <p>Many upper-caste Indians excoriate V. P. Singh as a traitor to his own high-caste heritage. That's no great surprise, say Indians in a position to know, considering that comments passed around Brahmin gatherings ("Would you want one of their surgeons to operate on you?") are often crudely derogatory. N. Ram, a leading Indian editor and writer, said that attacks on affirmative action in India could best be described as "racist" in the American sense. And so far, he adds, no one has mentioned affirmative action in the private sector, where company hiring policies are never scrutinized.</p>
        <p>"What I am sure of," Singh told an audience in April, "is that our independence, won after a century of struggle, will remain hollow if the power and authority of the state is not deployed in the pursuit of equity."</p>
        <p>THE NARROW LANES THAT lead to what is momentarily India's most famous religious monument are festooned with barbed wire and policed by zealots. The town is Ayodhya, sacred to Hindus as the birthplace of the god-king Rama, the central character of the epic "Ramayana." The building, however, is clearly a mosque, the Babri Masjid.</p>
        <p>Sentries stare menacingly at a visitor who is demonstrably not a Hindu. Off with the leather sandals, bag and the watch strap, they say. This may be a Muslim mosque, but the rules are orthodox Hindu. They have been since 1986, when the disputed building, sealed since 1949 after a similar religious confrontation, was ordered reopened by a local court during the administration of the Congress Party leader, Rajiv Gandhi.</p>
        <p>Although Rama is almost certainly a mythical character, Hindu militants claim that the pretty little 16th-century mosque was built on the exact site of his birth. Moreover, the militants have drawn up plans for a temple that could be constructed only if the Babri Masjid was demolished or moved, and they have a long list of other mosques they would like to see destroyed.</p>
        <p>As a result, the issue has taken on enormous symbolic weight, and Hinduism, the religion of more than 80 percent of Indians, has become a campaign issue for the first time since independence in 1947. The principal beneficiary of the Hindu revival, and the dark horse in this week's election, is the conservative Bharatiya Janata Party, led by the articulate parliamentarian, Lal Kishen Advani.</p>
        <p>Electoral support for the Bharatiya Janata Party is drawn in surprising degree from the middle class, now more than 100 million strong and heretofore looked upon as a modernizing influence. But while the new middle class is the source of progressive movements to protect consumers, the environment and civil and human rights, it is also proving to be a recruiting ground for Hindu militancy.</p>
        <p>In small towns across north India, shopkeepers fly the Bharatiya Janata Party flag. In cities, affluent women are drawn into revivalist movements. Hindu fundamentalism's best-known firebrand is a woman, Uma Bharati. Her provocative speeches are best sellers on audio- and videocassettes.</p>
        <p>"There are many problems the middle class faces," says Prof. Romila Thapar, a historian at Jawaharlal Nehru University, in Delhi. "First of all, theirs was a reasonably quick rise. You get artisans moving up the social scale because they have picked up professions that have become lucrative. They are trying to improve their social status." One of the ways they do this, Thapar says, is to imitate the devout Hinduism of the upper castes.</p>
        <p>"The issue of the Babri Masjid will bring up past passions," said Sorabjee, the former Attorney General, recalling the carnage of Hindu-Muslim violence in 1947. "The horror of it all is that I have heard people who should know better say that Muslims have had it too good for such a long time. This trend of intolerance is so unlike the India which we knew."</p>
        <p>WITH THIS ELECTION, INDIA BEGINS the torturous task of redefining itself, laying the foundation of a post-Nehruvian, post-cold-war future. The major question is whether that future will be forged through religious confrontation, caste war and civil strife or through the ballot and Parliament. As India begins its odyssey, the world can neither look away nor assume that the eternal, otherworldly "India of the Imagination," as K. Natwar Singh put it recently, can survive endless assaults on its down-to-earth institutions. "The real India needs remedial measures," he says.  ;Barbara Crossette is the New Delhi bureau chief of The New York Times.</p>
