        <p>After decades of indecision and bickering over how to protect Venice from increasingly frequent flooding, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi started Italy on one of its biggest public works projects in years today: a series of 79 sea gates for the city.</p>
        <p>The gates would rise from the ocean floor whenever especially high tides in the Adriatic threatened to swell the lagoon in which Venice sits. They would take eight years to build, Italian government officials said, and cost about $4 billion.</p>
        <p>Government officials said that was a small price to pay for the preservation of Venice, which is threatened by a combination of rising sea levels and the sinking of the city itself, built on a soggy foundation.</p>
        <p>''Venice is magnificent, the pride of Italy,'' said Mr. Berlusconi, who sealed a time capsule in a foundation stone at today's ceremony. ''The government will do whatever is necessary to preserve this marvel.''</p>
        <p>Not everyone was eager to see the realization of the sea gates. Environmental activists navigated the lagoon in boats today and shouted through megaphones.</p>
        <p>''No to Moses,'' some said, using the project's nickname, a reference to its parting of waters. ''No to useless works.''</p>
        <p>Eduardo Zanchini, who is monitoring the sea gates project for the environmental group Legambiente, said, ''This is not a good day for Venice, or Italy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Zanchini said that if the gates were used as often as they might be needed, they would destroy the ecosystem of the lagoon.</p>
        <p>Many Venetians were breathing a sigh of relief today, mindful of the 1966 flood that ravaged their city and the hundreds of subsequent floods that made yellow galoshes and raised boardwalks weekly or monthly necessities of Venetian life.</p>
        <p>Giovanni Mazzacurati, an architect for the project, said that when it is finished those annoyances would be memories. ''At least now we know that in eight years there won't be any more high water,'' he said.</p>
