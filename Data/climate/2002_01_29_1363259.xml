        <p>Until recently, it seemed as though this might be an old-fashioned winter after all, with driving winds, cold rain, and even a dusting of snow.</p>
        <p>But in recent days, the bizarre weather of two months ago has returned to the Northeast. Even as news arrived of snow in San Francisco, the temperature in New York sailed into the 60's yesterday, causing cherry trees to blossom in Brooklyn and crocuses -- the traditional harbingers of spring -- to bloom in Central Park.</p>
        <p>''It's kind of freaky,'' said Maryclaire Sullivan, as she stretched after a run in a T-shirt and shorts at the Columbus Circle entrance to Central Park. ''Look at the poor plants,'' she said, gesturing at the purple crocuses pushing up through the grass a few feet away. ''They don't know what to do.''</p>
        <p>Nearby, several dozen people were arrayed on the steps like guests at a garden party, some of them in short-sleeved shirts, listening to a song by Edith Piaf playing in the background.</p>
        <p>Today, temperatures in the New York City area are expected to rise to the low- to mid-60's, breaking the 55-degree record for the day set in 1975, said Fred Gadomski, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University. It was 62 degrees in Central Park on Sunday, and 60 yesterday, far above the 38-degree norm for this time of year, Mr. Gadomski said.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, some Manhattan restaurants set tables outside. On Sunday, the Loeb Boathouse in Central Park rented its boats -- the first time that has happened in January -- and for much of the afternoon all 106 boats were out, a feat rarely achieved even in June, said David Kayser, the boathouse's general manager. ''It was like a summer day,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The warmth, brought on by a mass of warm air pushing up from the mid-Atlantic region, is likely to retreat on Wednesday as a colder front moves in from Canada, Mr. Gadomski said. It is likely to return again by Friday, possibly with some rain, before the usual winter temperatures resume again over the weekend.</p>
        <p>To some, yesterday's warm weather was a blessing.</p>
        <p>''A little warmth is always welcome,'' said Kenneth Nelson, who was spending his lunch hour eating a cup of chili on the steps of Borough Hall in Brooklyn, where the pink blossoms of three cherry trees were visible around the corner, about two months early. ''It's the first time I've had lunch out here since November,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But others said they found the sudden retreat of winter unnerving. ''It gives people a false sense of security,'' said Steven B. Tabak, who had stripped down to his T-shirt to sit on a bench in the sun near where he works in the clerk's office of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn. ''Then it gets cold again and everyone gets bummed out.''</p>
        <p>Several said the warm weather just made them worry about how the dry winter is affecting the city's reservoirs. Others worried about the possibility of global warming.</p>
        <p>''We were talking about the greenhouse effect,'' Jill Braverman said as she emerged from a walk in Central Park with her boyfriend, Jeremy Palmer. ''It really makes you wonder how warm it's going to be this summer.''</p>
        <p>And some simply missed the pleasures of winter.</p>
        <p>''I think it's horrible,'' said Thomas Dorilio, 53, a private investigator who was dressed in a short-sleeved shirt. ''When the warm weather comes there are more people outside, and more trouble, and more crime. The winter's nice and quiet.''</p>
        <p>In the suburbs, where some areas got more snow than the city did earlier this month, the sudden burst of warmth seemed particularly jarring.</p>
        <p>''It stinks, it's abnormal and unnatural,'' said Cathy Hahn, 40, in Nanuet, N.Y., about 20 miles north of New York City. ''It means it is a deprivation for those who have become used to four seasons and have only been getting a kind of year-round spring.''</p>
        <p>In Hoboken, N.J., Jonathan Brown, a computer programmer who moved here from Dallas seven months ago, stood outside his office in a polo shirt.</p>
        <p>''So this is what the weather's like in the East,'' he said. As he donned his sunglasses, he said he was considering running down to the Hudson River and jumping in.</p>
