        <p>The major climate changes that may result from the warming of the earth's atmosphere are being delayed by 20 years because the use of the gases thought to cause the warming has been reduced, a space agency scientist says.</p>
        <p>Dr. James Hansen, a researcher at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Institute for Space Studies, said chlorofluorocarbons make up about 25 percent of the man-made gases believed to be trapping and retaining heat from the sun in a process similar to what happens in a greenhouse.</p>
        <p>But, Dr. Hansen said in a paper published in The Journal of Geophysical Research, if production of chlorofluorocarbons had not been reduced in 1974, the compound by now would have made up more than half the gases causing the atmospheric warming, and the planet would be heating faster.</p>
        <p>Scientists believe the warming of the earth's atmosphere could cause sea levels to rise, cause severe droughts and storms and severely disrupt the earth's biological systems.</p>
