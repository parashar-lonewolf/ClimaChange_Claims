        <p>Senator John W. Warner of Virginia touched off a Republican fight for the top party seat on the Senate environment committee Friday, announcing he wanted to use his seniority to bump Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma from the spot.</p>
        <p>Mr. Warner, who is losing his senior position on the Armed Services Committee as a result of term limits, said he intended to ask his Republican colleagues to elect him as the ranking Republican on the Environment and Public Works Committee, which is likely to address global warming issues in the new Congress.</p>

        <p>Senator John W. Warner of Virginia touched off a Republican fight for the top party seat on the Senate environment committee Friday, announcing he wanted to use his seniority to bump Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma from the spot.</p>
        <p>Mr. Warner, who is losing his senior position on the Armed Services Committee as a result of term limits, said he intended to ask his Republican colleagues to elect him as the ranking Republican on the Environment and Public Works Committee, which is likely to address global warming issues in the new Congress.</p>
        <p>The senator said his plan was in keeping with past Republican practice.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Inhofe, who has been outspoken in his skepticism that global warming is a result of human activity, said Friday that he would oppose Mr. Warner. ''I have long been a friend of John Warner,'' Mr. Inhofe said, ''however, I think he has misunderstood the rules.''</p>
        <p>With Democrats winning control of the Senate on Nov. 7, Senator Barbara Boxer of California will be the new chairwoman of the environment committee.</p>
        <p>She has indicated that legislation to curb global warming will be a chief priority.</p>
