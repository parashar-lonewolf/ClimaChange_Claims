        <p>For several heart-stopping hours, it seemed as if last Thursday would be Britain's 9/11. There were the same panicky television reports -- an explosion here, a power outage there, a bomb somewhere else -- and the same terrible sense that events were unfolding almost too quickly for human understanding, that there might be fresh hell yet to come.</p>
        <p>But 7/7 was markedly different from 9/11, both because of the physical differences between the two disasters and because of the ineffable thing that is the British character. ''I tenderly love this city with its wounds,'' the French writer Simone Weil wrote about London during World War II. ''What strikes me most about these people, in their present situation, is a good humor that is neither spontaneous nor artificial, but that comes from a feeling of fraternal and tender comradeship in a common ordeal.''</p>

        <p>For several heart-stopping hours, it seemed as if last Thursday would be Britain's 9/11. There were the same panicky television reports -- an explosion here, a power outage there, a bomb somewhere else -- and the same terrible sense that events were unfolding almost too quickly for human understanding, that there might be fresh hell yet to come.</p>
        <p>But 7/7 was markedly different from 9/11, both because of the physical differences between the two disasters and because of the ineffable thing that is the British character. ''I tenderly love this city with its wounds,'' the French writer Simone Weil wrote about London during World War II. ''What strikes me most about these people, in their present situation, is a good humor that is neither spontaneous nor artificial, but that comes from a feeling of fraternal and tender comradeship in a common ordeal.''</p>
        <p>Or, as Maj. Alan Frost, a reservist in the British Army working on Sunday at a huge public commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II, put it in an interview: ''Look how marvelous this all is.''</p>
        <p>He pointed to the crowds, thousands of people gathered around Buckingham Palace and down the large boulevard in front it, defying the notion that such a large gathering could prove a tempting terrorist target. ''There's something about Londoners -- about the British,'' he said. ''We just tend to get on with it.''</p>
        <p>Of course, it is easier to get on with life after something that, considered in the grim calculus of these things, is not so bad as it might have been. The attacks on New York came without warning, killing an estimated 2,752 people and altering forever not only the city's proud, iconic skyline, but also a nation's innocence.</p>
        <p>By such unfortunate standards, the London bombings were relatively small. The death toll, 49 on Sunday, is not expected to rise even into the three figures. The transportation system was briefly shut down, but is now mostly back to normal. People in central London did hear sirens throughout the day and had to resort by the thousands to walking home from work.</p>
        <p>But there was nothing like the great big cloud of ash that spread over New York in 2001, blotting out the sun and seeping into people's pores like a poisonous gas.</p>
        <p>And once it became clear how bad the bombings had been -- and how, God forbid, they could have been much worse -- London's first impulse was to get back to normal as quickly as possible, even though nothing really felt normal.</p>
        <p>The prime minister, host of the meeting of the Group of 8 industrial nations in Scotland, flew to London but returned to Scotland that night, resuming discussions of global warming and aid to Africa.</p>
        <p>In the House of Commons, members of Parliament doggedly spent the morning debating the scheduled issues of the day, before turning to the terrorist attacks.</p>
        <p>In Liverpool Street train station, above one of the subway explosions, trains were running again on schedule. The station's Starbucks was open, too, complete with a handwritten sign apologizing for the lack of a public garbage can -- it had been removed so that no one could drop a bomb in it.</p>
        <p>There were jitters everywhere, and the beginning of regular security alerts that would close train and subway stations and Birmingham city center. But there was also a determination to carry on, as there had been in the long years when the Irish Republican Army regularly attacked London, planting bombs on buses, in stores and in office buildings.</p>
        <p>The desire to live a normal life no matter what is familiar to Londoners who endured the Blitz in World War II, and to Britons in other cities who spent much of the war in and out of bomb shelters, gas masks at the ready.</p>
        <p>Familiar, too, is the notion that perhaps the only thing more embarrassing than publicly complaining is publicly showing emotional weakness. This is more common in the older generations who lived through the war.</p>
        <p>The famous British stiff upper lip does wobble now, most memorably eight years ago after the car accident that killed Diana, the Princess of Wales. But the great outpouring of grief and bewilderment in the strange days that followed Diana's death seem, in retrospect, to have reflected a kind of pre-millennial madness, closer to sentimentality than to heartfelt anguish.</p>
        <p>People are sad now, but it is a different sort of sadness, mixed with defiance. This was particularly evident among the crowds gathered for the World War II commemoration on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Lorraine Barrett, 41, a supermarket cashier, put aside her fears of public transportation and traveled to the palace in honor of her father, who served in the war and died of cancer in 1989.</p>
        <p>''I was determined to come, no matter what,'' Ms. Barrett said, mentioning that she had been just down the street from the nail bomb that exploded in a pub in Soho, in central London in 1999, killing 2 people and injuring 30. ''I'm not going to let what happened in the last few days stop me from doing what I want.''</p>
        <p>Walking briskly along, Fred Reed, 81, and his wife, Connie, 76, stopped to talk about Mr. Reed's brother, who was killed in February 1941. Mrs. Reed was wearing his posthumous medals on her jacket.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reed enlisted in the Royal Navy a year after his brother was killed. ''I'm sure my parents were worried,'' he said, ''but they never said so. You wanted to get the war over and done with.''</p>
        <p>He said he was ''stationed all over the shop'' -- meaning in different parts of the world -- but demurred when asked if had been in harrowing battles, saying he had not had a particularly difficult time.</p>
        <p>''Well, D-Day,'' Mrs. Reed said.</p>
        <p>Some of the veterans recalled the days of World War II when -- in a poignant reversal of last Thursday's horrors -- the London subway system provided sanctuary from German bombing raids.</p>
        <p>''That's the great irony of it,'' said Doug Tidy, 82, a former Royal Air Force squadron leader. ''Then, people thought they were safe underground. Today, we're celebrating the end of one war, but we seem to have started a new one.''</p>
