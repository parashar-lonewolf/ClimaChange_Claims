        <p>8 P.M. (5) THAT 70'S SHOW -- Season premiere. The aging teenagers of Point Place, Wis., are back, but without Eric (Topher Grace), who has moved to Africa. Ashton Kutcher is still around, very briefly, as Kelso. Kelso's first task is to persuade his old girlfriend, Jackie (Mila Kunis, above, with Mr. Kutcher), to take back Hyde (Danny Masterson), who was about to propose. But Hyde has brought back a souvenir of his recent trip to Las Vegas that will put a different light on things.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (13) GLOBAL WARMING: THE SIGNS AND THE SCIENCE -- As this devastating hurricane season comes to an end (please!), a one-hour special looks at extreme climate change, its effects and people who are trying to do something to make a difference. Alanis Morissette is the celebrity host.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (7) LOST -- It's a rerun.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (5) TRADING SPOUSES: MEET YOUR NEW MOMMY -- Season premiere. Marguerite Perrin is a devout Christian. She goes to live with the Flishers, who are more into astrology, hypnotherapy and Tarot cards. Part 1 of 2.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (National Geographic) SCIENCE OF THE BIBLE: THE LAST SUPPER -- Where was it held? What was on the menu? Was it Passover?</p>
        <p>12:15 A.M. (TCM) TOUCH OF EVIL (1958). In the last Hollywood film that Orson Welles directed, Charlton Heston plays Ramon Miguel Vargas, a Mexican narcotics officer whose ''future is all used up,'' as a fortuneteller (Marlene Dietrich) says. (Casting a Mexican actor in the role would have been too forward-thinking.) Vargas, honeymooning with his blond American wife (Janet Leigh, above, with Mr. Heston), becomes the victim of a crooked American cop (Welles), who wants to keep him from testifying in a drug trial. It all starts with a car bomb.</p>

        <p>Correction:  November 7, 2005, Monday  A television highlight entry on Wednesday for the film ''Touch of Evil'' misidentified the character whose future is described by the fortune teller (Marlene Dietrich) as ''all used up.'' It is Capt. Hank Quinlan, played by Orson Welles, not Ramon Miguel Vargas, played by Charlton Heston.</p>
