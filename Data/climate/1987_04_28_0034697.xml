        <p>Since March, a barge carrying 3,100 tons of garbage from Islip, L.I., has journeyed down the East Coast and into the Gulf of Mexico in search of a dump site. Although the barge has been turned away at each stop, private waste contractors are now negotiating with a Caribbean country in hopes that it will agree to take the waste.</p>
        <p>If the talks are successful, archeologists on some Caribbean island may mark 1987 as the end of the pre-Islipian era, when North American garbage was first introduced, much as the pre-Columbian period of native South American art ended with the arrival of the Europeans.</p>
        <p>The silliness and irresponsibility with which some public officials and private operators approach the solid waste problem should not obscure the fact that New York and the rest of the nation face a serious crisis in disposal capacity. Rational approaches to address this problem, however, do not include launching barges of refuse to unknown destinations or to landfills beyond the horizon where environmental protection is unheard of.</p>
        <p>Last year, the New York State Legislative Commission on Solid Waste Management reported that state landfills had at best only nine years of capacity remaining. A year later, at least 18 landfills - about 4 percent of the state's capacity - had closed, while not one opened.</p>
        <p>New York's annual waste flow has increased to 18.4 million tons, up 7 percent from last year. Though the increase may be an expression of better record-keeping, we have a long way to go to meet the ambitious goals of 10 percent reduction and 40 percent recycling called for in the state's solid waste management plan.</p>
        <p>The plan sets priorities that place waste reduction first, followed by reuse, recycling, energy recovery and finally landfill dumping. Critics feel some options should be pursued to the exclusion of the others. But that is naive. Recycling, incineration and landfill dumping are interrelated. The success of any one option depends on the success of the others. For example, most paper mills that accept waste paper as feedstock produce a sludge that requires landfill disposal. Moreover, scrap metal processors face rising costs for disposing of the nonmetallic residue that remains after shreading junk cars, appliances and other products. Even a fiberglass manufacturer in upstate New York that uses scrap glass recently canceled a planned expansion because of the high cost of shipping its waste 300 miles away. Rising costs of disposal could force plants to choose between relocation and closure. Either way, more waste arrives at landfills.</p>
        <p>The state stands to lose its ability to recycle waste because of a lack of landfill capacity. If that happens, the state's landfills would reach capacity even faster than has been predicted, and they will be filled with materials that could have been recycled.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, companies and businesses looking to expand or locate in New York because of its healthy economy and declining tax rate will be reluctant to operate in a community where waste has to be shipped hundreds of miles away.</p>
        <p>New York's landfills should be reserved for the highest priority wastes: residues from recycling operations. We could reduce waste volume by 10 percent through incineration that uses the best available air pollution control technology.</p>
        <p>Dumping raw waste in landfills not only subverts recycling efforts, it wreaks havoc with our ground and surface water resources and on our air. Scientists recently determined that landfill gas helps deplete the protective atmospheric ozone layer, worsening the ''greenhouse effect.''</p>
        <p>Leadership is sorely needed to address this complex crisis. The Legislature should seriously consider several steps, including a tax on packaging, government purchase of recycled products, tax incentives for the recycling industry and improvements on the recycling statute, the Returnable Beverage Container Law. Unless we act now, our garbage may go away, but it will not, as the Flat Earth society once believed, fall off the edge of the planet. The waste will return in the form of polluted air and water, and could bury our economy as well.</p>
