        <p>LEAD: A GENE found in a wild bean plant from Mexico may soon be added to the list of new biological approaches to pest control.</p>
        <p>A GENE found in a wild bean plant from Mexico may soon be added to the list of new biological approaches to pest control.</p>
        <p>By breeding the gene into cultivated bean plants, United States researchers have been able to introduce a natural resistance to the bean weevil, a major threat to stored beans. Unless stored beans are fumigated with a chemical pesticide, weevils often eat as much as 15 percent of them before they reach the pot. Since dry beans provide half or more of the protein for much of the world's population, an inexpensive way to prevent such losses is of major social and economic significance.</p>
        <p>The gene causes beans to produce a protein called arcelin that is highly toxic to the weevils.</p>
        <p>The achievement underscores the importance of preserving wild versions of economically important plants. Currently, the habitats of many wild plants, especially those in developing countries, are being rapidly destroyed in the course of development. Before the plants are lost forever, plant breeders are trying to identify and preserve those that may harbor genes that could be used to improve existing crops.</p>
        <p>Among such desirable genetic characteristics are shorter growing season, heat or frost tolerance and insect and disease resistance.</p>
        <p>According to Thomas Osborn, a geneticist in the agronomy department at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, the protective bean gene was discovered by him and his colleague, Frederick Bliss, a horticulturist, in the process of screening wild beans for the proteins they contained. They found the protein arcelin, at about the same time that researchers at the Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT) of Cali, Colombia, published their discovery of wild beans that resist bean weevils.</p>
        <p>''When they published their list, we realized that many of the wild beans that resist bean weevils also contain arcelin,'' Dr. Bliss said.</p>
        <p>Through a series of crosses between the wild beans and a common cultivated bean variety called Sanilac, the gene that codes for arcelin was introduced, producing a strain of Sanilac that was highly resistance to the weevil.</p>
        <p>Tests showed that while arcelin is highly toxic to weevils, rats fed cooked beans that contain arcelin suffered no ill effects. The Wisconsin researchers said that if further studies showed that arcelin has no adverse effects on people, farmers might be growing beans with arcelin worldwide within five years. The findings were published in the April 8 issue of the journal Science.</p>
        <p>Icebergs seem to be breaking away from the Antarctic ice shelves in abnormally large numbers, and the Government's iceberg watchers are wondering whether the trend may be a harbinger of climate changes to come.</p>
