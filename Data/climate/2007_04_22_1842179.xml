        <p>EARLIER this month, at the New York International Auto Show, an exhibit celebrated the 100th anniversary of the gasoline-powered taxi in New York City. Across town, Mayor Michael Bloomberg was unveiling the first study of the city's greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
        <p>Mayor Bloomberg knows these emissions contribute to global warming and has called the problem ''one of the most urgent tests of our time.'' He has set a goal of cutting the city's greenhouse gases by 30 percent by 2030. Part of his plan should be to mandate improved fuel efficiency for taxis -- and what better time to talk about this than today, Earth Day, as the mayor officially puts forward his outline for a greener city.</p>
        <p>There are 12,779 taxis on the streets of New York. Last year, these vehicles traveled more than 800 million miles. Ninety-two percent of these taxis are the Ford Crown Victoria, which the United States Environmental Protection Agency estimates gets 18 miles to the gallon. Because of traffic, the actual mileage achieved on New York City streets is about 30 percent less.</p>
        <p>The environmental impact of the taxi fleet is enormous. According to the Environmental Protection Agency's carbon calculator, the average New York taxi emits more than 100,000 pounds of carbon dioxide each year. The total fleet emits nearly 580,000 metric tons. That is nearly 800 pounds for each resident of Manhattan and the equivalent of what 500,000 acres of pine forests would store in carbon for one year.</p>
        <p>Everyone knows that carbon dioxide emissions are a leading contributor to climate change. Climate change is melting glaciers in Greenland, the Andes, Alaska and Asia and threatening the polar ice caps. All this melting will lead to a significant rise in sea levels. More than 170 nations have endorsed the Kyoto Protocol in an attempt to tackle this problem. The United States has not ratified the agreement, but local officials are starting to move in the right direction.</p>
        <p>Mayor Bloomberg is out front on climate change and he should continue to lead the nation on this issue. He has met with Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California to collaborate on ways to reduce greenhouse gases. The governor recently signed a law to reduce emissions by 25 percent in California. Mayor Bloomberg has also signed an agreement with more than 450 other mayors to reduce global warming pollution, and next month the city will play host to a climate meeting involving mayors from more than 30 of the world's largest cities.</p>
        <p>The first step is to measure the city's greenhouse gas emissions. The second step is to reduce them.</p>
        <p>Mayor Bloomberg has completed the first step. The study he unveiled this month found that in 2005 New York City's greenhouse gas emissions totaled 58 million metric tons.</p>
        <p>The mayor is now preparing the city for the second step: reducing emissions. Mandating improved fuel efficiency for the taxi fleet would be one simple way to help achieve the city's goals.</p>
        <p>The mandate would be inexpensive. The Taxi and Limousine Commission has evaluated six hybrid models that average 39 miles to the gallon. On average, these models cost $2,430 more than the Crown Victoria, but they would save $3,713 in fuel every year. It is a case where the short-term economics work in favor of immediate action.</p>
        <p>The mandate would cut greenhouse gas emissions from the fleet quickly. The city requires that most cabs be retired after three years. If improved mileage were mandated today, more than 90 percent of taxis would be upgraded decades before the mayor's 2030 goal.</p>
        <p>The mandate would be equitable. Recent taxi fare increases have resulted in a windfall for medallion owners. Since the 2004 increase, the value of medallions has soared by more than $100,000 and drivers' incomes are up 37 percent. In November, fares were raised yet again. Mandating some reinvestment of these windfalls to protect the environment is reasonable.</p>
        <p>At the auto show, the goal of the taxi exhibition was to reinvent the New York City taxi system. It proposed models with improved roof lights, bigger passenger compartments and bolder graphics. Several designs incorporated hybrids, alternative fuels and zero emission technologies.</p>
        <p>Mayor Bloomberg knows that New York, a city especially vulnerable to rising sea levels, cannot afford to ignore the reality of climate change. Mandates today can double the fuel economy of the fleet and halve their emissions. After 100 years on the road, it is time to paint New York City's taxis green.</p>
