        <p>Members of Congress said today that they were besieged by complaints from passengers about the air quality in airline cabins.</p>
        <p>"Our mail, questions we receive from our constituents, and my conversations with colleagues are a catalogue of complaints of headache, ear discomfort, sinus and bronchial ailments, viral infections, respiratory illness, nose and throat irritation, and other ailments following flights," said Representative James L.

        <p>Members of Congress said today that they were besieged by complaints from passengers about the air quality in airline cabins.</p>
        <p>"Our mail, questions we receive from our constituents, and my conversations with colleagues are a catalogue of complaints of headache, ear discomfort, sinus and bronchial ailments, viral infections, respiratory illness, nose and throat irritation, and other ailments following flights," said Representative James L. Oberstar, the Minnesota Democrat who is chairman of the aviation subcommittee of the Public Works and Transportation Committee.</p>
        <p>Although healthy passengers may not be harmed by the reduction of fresh air in airline cabins that began in the late 1980's, Mr. Oberstar said, people with respiratory infections and other diseases are more vulnerable. "Air quality must not only protect healthy passengers but those who are sensitive to chemicals, or whose immune systems may be compromised, " he said.</p>
        <p>Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of Manhattan, said he had been notified by passengers "who have reported a variety of ailments during and after their flights."</p>
        <p>Mr. Nadler is a co-sponsor of a bill that would require airlines to provide 20 cubic feet of fresh air per minute per passenger, twice what is sometimes received.</p>
        <p>Experts estimate that reducing the amount of fresh air circulated in the cabin to 50 percent from 100 percent saves an average of $60,000 in fuel per plane per year.</p>
        <p>Administration officials and airline executives said that the air quality in airline cabins was no worse than that in theaters and other densely populated enclosed areas. "Research indicates that commercial air travel poses no unique or significant risk to the health of passengers or crew," said Dr. Jon L. Jordan, a Federal air surgeon with the Federal Aviation Administration.</p>
        <p>Jim Landry, president of the Air Transport Association, which represents the major airlines, said, "No valid study done by government or industry has ever found airline air quality to be the cause of health problems and airline passengers should continue to be confident in airline safety and air quality."</p>
        <p>One reason it is difficult to assess the effect of air travel on a passenger's health is that researchers seldom know the physical condition of a passenger before boarding a flight. In addition, some passengers become tense on a flight, while others find plane trips physically taxing.</p>
        <p>Dr. John Spengler of the Harvard University School of Public Health, who discussed a recent study of 22 flights, said that carbon dioxide levels on flights with partly recirculated air were up to twice the levels measured on planes with 100 percent fresh air. Variety of Contaminants</p>
        <p>The study found that the aircraft with recirculating air did not meet the standard for office building ventilation set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers. It also found a variety of contaminants on aircraft, but concluded that additional work was needed to discover the actual rate of disease and discomfort resulting from air travel.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Oberstar said: "Clearly, people are getting sick. We don't need more studies to take action."</p>
        <p>Mr. Nadler added, "Imagine being hermetically sealed in a cabin with someone who has drug-resistant TB on a trans-Atlantic flight for 7 to 10 hours."</p>
        <p>Clinton Administration officials have criticized the spraying of loaded airplanes with insecticides, which then drip on passengers' clothing and faces. This spraying is required by many Caribbean, South American and South Pacific nations before planes from other countries land.</p>
        <p>The panel criticized the Federal Aviation Administration for its failure to set standards and issue regulations to insure a minimum flow of fresh air in the airline cabins.</p>
