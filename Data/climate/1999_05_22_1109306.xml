        <p>One month after the killings at Columbine High School, 80 law-enforcement investigators are planning to labor through the summer to determine whether any friends of the two teen-age gunmen aided them or knew about the attack beforehand.</p>
        <p>With Columbine seniors preparing to graduate on Saturday, such basic questions remain as detectives study E-mail, 15 personal computer hard drives, video rental records and conflicting stories from the 1,400 interviews conducted so far.</p>
        <p>Forensic technicians are trying to match hundreds of bullets and casings to the guns used by law-enforcement officials and by the two gunmen, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. Unmatched bullets could indicate that a third gunman participated in the shooting, which left 15 people dead, including Mr. Harris and Mr. Klebold.</p>
        <p>It is possible that the two teen-agers could have carried in the 51 bombs that were found in and around the school, said Larry Bettendorf, a spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms and Tobacco. He said that most of the bombs were either small carbon dioxide cartridges filled with black powder or medium-size bombs filled with homemade napalm. The largest bomb, made from two propane tanks, was found in a duffel bag in the school cafeteria.</p>
        <p>After several house searches and lie detector tests, one acquaintance of the gunmen has been arrested. Mark Manes, 22, a computer technician, was charged with providing a handgun to a minor.</p>
        <p>Robyn Anderson, Mr. Klebold's 18-year-old prom date, bought two shotguns and a semi-automatic rifle for the two boys last fall from unlicensed dealers at a gun show near Denver, Mr. Bettendorf said. Had she bought the guns from a federally licensed dealer, she might have faced Federal charges of acting as a ''straw purchaser'' for minors, but sales by unlicensed dealers are not covered by the law.</p>
        <p>''We are looking very carefully to see if any Federal laws were violated. We are looking at the chain of the sale of the weapons,'' said Tom Strickland, the United States Attorney here.</p>
        <p>''There is a huge amount of evidence that is being investigated,'' Mr. Strickland said.</p>
        <p>The Jefferson County Sheriff's office plans to return control of the high school to the school district on June 1.</p>
        <p>Near the school, the last memorials honoring the victims have been removed from a park. Last week, a tractor-trailer truck carried the items eight miles north to a Federal warehouse, where they fill 40 rooms, or 21,000 square feet. This summer, a committee is to evaluate proposals for a permanent memorial in the park. The memorial could include some of the photographs, flowers, poetry and placards placed by mourners.</p>
        <p>The victims are being remembered by more than flowers. Donations totaling more than $3 million have been received by 15 charitable funds. The Healing Fund, administered by the local United Way, has already distributed almost $400,000, including $5,000 to each of the 38 families.</p>
        <p>One of the neediest cases is Lance Kirklin, 16, who was shot five times. Mr. Kirklin, who does not have medical insurance, faces $1 million in medical bills and at least five more facial surgeries.</p>
        <p>Two other boys, Richard Castaldo, 17, and Sean Graves, 15, have lower body paralysis, which doctors hope will be temporary. Patrick Ireland, 17, who crawled out of a window into the waiting arms of law-enforcement officials, also remains hospitalized, as does Mark Taylor, 16, who is in serious but stable condition. The one girl still in the hospital, Anne Marie Hochhalter, 17, is in fair condition.</p>
        <p>In the month since the shootings, some parents have channeled their grief into action.</p>
        <p>Rick Castaldo, father of Richard, has started to campaign to shield minors from violence and pornography on the Internet. Tom Mauser, whose son Gary, 15, was killed, has helped found Sane Alternatives to the Firearms Epidemic, a state lobby for gun control. This political action committee is chaired by two former Colorado Governors, John Love, a Republican, and Richard Lamm, a Democrat turned independent.</p>
