        <p>The Real World Understanding the Modern World Through the New Geography Edited by Bruce Marshall Illustrated. 264 pages. Houghton Mifflin. $35.</p>
        <p>Here is a book that claims to explain the modern world better than history, economics or anthropology can. It is subtitled "Understanding the Modern World Through the New Geography." What is the "new geography"? Neither the book's editor, Bruce Marshall, nor its principal writer, Philip Boys, ever defines it in so many words. But one quickly gets the idea that whatever it is, it's more dynamic than the old geography, which, one supposes, confined one to looking at maps of countries and memorizing capital cities, average rainfalls, principal raw materials, characteristic crops and so forth.</p>

        <p>The Real World Understanding the Modern World Through the New Geography Edited by Bruce Marshall Illustrated. 264 pages. Houghton Mifflin. $35.</p>
        <p>Here is a book that claims to explain the modern world better than history, economics or anthropology can. It is subtitled "Understanding the Modern World Through the New Geography." What is the "new geography"? Neither the book's editor, Bruce Marshall, nor its principal writer, Philip Boys, ever defines it in so many words. But one quickly gets the idea that whatever it is, it's more dynamic than the old geography, which, one supposes, confined one to looking at maps of countries and memorizing capital cities, average rainfalls, principal raw materials, characteristic crops and so forth.</p>
        <p>To illustrate the book's approach, the authors begin with a six-page spread on Switzerland's Rhone Valley, where, according to the table of contents, "a chocolate bar, a gold watch and a secret bank account symbolize the powerful influences of geography." In this section, a combination of photographs, diagrams, text and captions explains how Switzerland evolved in its unlikely setting.  We learn, among other things, that "the lack of raw materials caused the Swiss economy to concentrate on value-added goods -- those in which the profit comes from the investment of workmanship and expertise."</p>
        <p>The section concludes: "The story of Switzerland reflects in microcosm the central precept of this book -- that the history and social and economic development of a people or an area demonstrate in every aspect the intimate, dynamic interaction between humans and their broader physical environment. Switzerland's geography, which seems to conspire against it, explains its success and its position in today's real world."</p>
        <p>What follows is a volume of striking layouts and appealing diagrams that seek to explain how the entire modern world evolved in the context of its physical setting. In one typically concise two-page spread, an imaginary landscape is illustrated to demonstrate 14 physical reasons that lines are commonly chosen to divide one state from another -- "Rivers as borders," for example, or "Borders marked by corridor access to sea or river" and so on -- although the accompanying text makes the point that in the real world such practical considerations are often ignored.</p>
        <p>All together the various spreads try to show how the planet Earth developed and people came to populate it, how the modern world system came into being and the crises it now faces as a result, how people settled where they did and the lines they have drawn between them, and finally how they learned to draw maps of the world.</p>
        <p>The experience of reading the book straight through, which it seems to demand since it lacks any obvious reference points, is both nerve-racking and stimulating. The text and the captions are often redundant, and it takes a while to get an overview and determine that you should read the captions before the text.</p>
        <p>Once you get into the swing you learn all sorts of useful tidbits, such as how the earth's crustal plates move and how the need to reclaim land from the sea led the Dutch to become expert in plant propagation.  You see how Paris grew over the centuries and how the principles of the Koran govern Islamic architecture: "A vividness inside parallels the emphasis in the Koran on the richness of the inner self compared to more modest outward appearance."</p>
        <p>As thousands of details accumulate, you despair over there ever being resolutions to the conflicts arising from the many sources of trouble around the globe: ethnic disputes, unstable borders, geographical choke points, as the book refers to such straits as Gibraltar, Hormuz and Malacca, and the so-called shatterbelts constituted by Eastern Europe and Central America.</p>
        <p>Most depressing of all is the seeming inevitablity of ecological crises: overpopulation, pollution, extinctions, food and resource depletion and global warming. The only straw to grasp at is that consciousness may be raised by the broader perspective that books like this one offer. As one map maker whose work appears in "The Real World" puts it: "International peace, as well as good resource management, is dependent on our planetary, or whole-Earth, awareness, as opposed to our everyday, flat-Earth consciousness." This book certainly shows you the entire big blue marble.</p>
        <p>Still, one wonders how the book can be used. There's nothing to go back to and look up, so it isn't really a reference work. Browsing through it, one finds its information overdigested.  One caption informs us that with the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, supplies of cotton dwindled and Manchester, England, was forced to look elsewhere. "The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 halved the traveling time between Britain and India, and made India an alternative source of cotton." Is one to conclude from this that the building of the Suez Canal was a response to the American Civil War?</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, in a caption to a map of Israel in 1967, we are told: "In one of the most astonishing offensives in history, Israel simultaneously attacked Egypt, Syria and Jordan, taking the Gaza Strip, Sinai, the West Bank (including the whole of Jerusalem) and the Golan Heights of southwestern Syria." This seems a somewhat constricted version of what actually happened in the war that year.</p>
        <p>In short, what you miss in this book is the sense of serendipity you get from staring at a map and reaching your own conclusions. You miss the old geography, which expected you to learn by heart the location of the 48 states. This book tells you how the various sections of this country were acquired, but nowhere is there a map of the states.</p>
        <p>In fact, for all it tells you about Switzerland's Rhone Valley, it never bothers to illustrate exactly where the Rhone River flows. To learn that you need an atlas, which this book makes you miss. Despite all "The Real World" tells you, it's no substitute for reality. Or even a map of reality.</p>
