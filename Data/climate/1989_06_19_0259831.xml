        <p>LEAD: High levels of ozone and acid rain, pollution normally associated with industrialization, have been found for the first time over the virgin rain forests of Central Africa.</p>
        <p>High levels of ozone and acid rain, pollution normally associated with industrialization, have been found for the first time over the virgin rain forests of Central Africa.</p>
        <p>Scientists who made the discovery said the pollution was particularly alarming because it exists throughout the year and is comparable to levels in Europe and North America.</p>
        <p>The findings, which surprised other specialists on the tropics, have created new concerns about the future of Africa's equatorial forests, which are already under siege from a fast-growing population and the work of lumbermen.</p>
        <p>The acid and ozone pollution stretches from the Congo basin in the heart of Africa to the west coast and sweeps out over the Atlantic Ocean, the scientists say.</p>
        <p>The magnitude of the ozone, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and methane released by man-made fires is also raising new questions about their contribution to the greenhouse effect. Those gases and others trap heat from the sun in a process similar to what happens in a greenhouse, and that is expected to raise global temperatures.</p>
        <p>The scientists, who belong to separate teams from West Germany and France, said the acid rain and ozone pollution - held to be harmful to plants - are largely caused by man-made fires that rage for months across thousands of miles of African savannas. Farmers and herdsmen set the fires to clear shrubs and to stimulate the growth of crops and grass.</p>
        <p>''We don't know yet what this does; the research is too new,'' said Dr. Meinrat Andreae, who headed the West German team. ''We also don't yet know how sensitive the tropical forest is to this. But with a mix like this in Germany or the U.S., we would have to look for damage to the forest.''</p>
        <p>The pioneering studies were presented at a conference on fire ecology late last month at the University of Freiburg, West Germany, and included the most comprehensive data yet about emissions from fires in Africa.</p>
        <p>That and other new research is drawing attention to the little understood but apparently dramatic impact of the African savanna fires on the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>In a new study, Dr. Paul Crutzen, a leading atmospheric scientist currently at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz, West Germany, reported that African fires were the world's leading contributor to pollution coming from the burning of vegetation. African savanna fires are so extensive, he said, that they pump three times more gases and particles into the air than all the fires set by farmers and settlers in South America, including the dramatic fires of the Amazon. Burnings and Rain Forests</p>
        <p>Of all the carbon dioxide released by burning or deforestation, he said, at least half comes from Africa. On a global scale, he said, burning and rotting vegetation of newly cut forest accounts for a third of the world's carbon dioxide, while two-thirds come from industrial burning of fossil fuel.</p>
        <p>Recent satellite readings have also shown that while Africa's traditional burnings destroy much less rain forest than those in Latin America, the savanna fires cover a greater area, burn a greater volume of the dry grass, shrubs and trees and are more frequent than anywhere else in the tropics. Land clearing through fire is a common among farmers throughout the developing world.</p>
        <p>''The forest burns once and it is destroyed, but the savannas and the grasslands become larger and are burned regularly,'' said Dr. Crutzen, a Dutch meteorologist.</p>
        <p>Dr. Crutzen, who was the first scientist to draw attention to the enormous impact of tropical fires on the atmosphere and on the greenhouse effect, also warned that the world must count on increasing pollution from the tropics as the population grows and more forests are turned into fields and grasslands, which are burned with more frequency. Acidity in Clouds and Mist</p>
        <p>In the case of acid rain, two groups of scientists found levels they described as pH 4, or almost 10 times more than normal acidity, in the Congo and the Ivory Coast. Jean Pierre Lacaux, whose French team carried out the most extensive ground and air tests for more than three years, said ''the scale of the acidity in Africa is very serious.''</p>
        <p>It is present in all the forests of equatorial Africa, from the Ivory Coast across Central Africa to Gabon, Congo and Zaire, he said. High acidity has been linked to tree damage in temperate forests. Specialists say that in the soil, high acidity can cause changes in the root system of plants and affect their ability to take up nutrients, while the air or rainwater acidity can damage the leaves.</p>
        <p>''We found the high acidity in the fog and mists that hang over the forests and the same high levels in cloud water and rainwater,'' said Mr. Lacaux, a specialist in cloud physics at the Center of Atmospheric Research in Lannemezan in the French Pyrenees. Part of the acidity, he noted, was natural, given off by living vegetation and decomposing forest litter. But most, he said, were formic and acetic acid as well as nitric acid caused by the fires. Hydrocarbons released by burning in turn created more acidity. 'Thick Haze of Soil Dust'</p>
        <p>''We found fire emissions all year long because the burning goes on all the time,'' Mr. Lacaux said in a telephone interview. ''Part of the year it is above the Equator and part of the year below the Equator. But the winds move the emissions in such a way that the Congo is affected almost the entire year.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Andreae, who has also studied the atmosphere over the Amazon, said that fires there produced very high acidity in the air during the dry season. But during the rest of the year, the Amazon clouds returned to their natural, slightly acid levels, he said. Last year Dr. Andreae and his team from the Max Planck Institute rigged a small plane as a laboratory to work over the Congo.</p>
        <p>''We found the most serious pollution I have ever seen over primary forest,'' he said. Flying some 400 miles north of Brazzaville and 200 miles east and west, he said, ''there seemed to be no beginning or end to the pollution.''</p>
        <p>''There was a thick haze of soil dust and smoke and very high acidity reaching a pH level of 3.9,'' said Dr. Andreae. But most surprising, he said, was the high ozone pollution right above the forest.</p>
        <p>Such findings are regarded as important evidence by scientists who study atmospheric chemistry in the tropical regions. The object of such research is to monitor the contribution by tropical forests to key compounds in the atmosphere that regulate climate and life on earth. The role of the equatorial forests, which is now widely regarded as vital, has only gained recognition in the last decade and is now becoming the object of wider research.</p>
        <p>''In the tropics, the air is like soup cooking, it's mixing and moving huge air masses and the north-east wind over Africa moves it west,'' said Dr. Crutzen. ''We don't know yet if the high acidity is a big problem or a small problem for the tropical forest and we don't know whether the high ozone is damaging the forest. But we have to raise the questions because the burnings in the tropics will only increase.''</p>
