        <p>THE line of cars that approached Belleayre Mountain last Sunday had clogged two-lane Route 28 in the Catskills, but it was a patient procession. People did not seem to mind the wait. They had, after all, been waiting for this day for months.</p>
        <p>After weeks of rain and warm temperatures in the Northeast, finally there had been a well-timed snowstorm. Days before the Presidents' Day weekend, Belleayre received two feet of snow. Sunday, its parking lots overflowed. At the ski rental desk, they ran out of equipment to hand out. On the sun deck off the wooden main lodge, the picnic tables were full. As loud music played, the crowd seemed enveloped in one large group giggle.</p>
        <p>The atmosphere matched the mood of Tony Lanza, the Belleayre superintendent, who walked the lodges and skied from lift to lift with an ever-present smile. He had been at work in the rain and fog of the last big holiday, at the close of the Martin Luther King's Birthday weekend in January, when Belleayre played host to just 420 skiers and riders.</p>
        <p>Sunday, more than 6,000 visited Belleayre.</p>
        <p>''Skiers are a resilient bunch, and I knew they were still with us,'' Mr. Lanza said. ''You never despair in this business. You just wait for things to even out. We average about 140 inches of snow a year, so when we were sitting at 20 inches for the winter, I never really thought we'd finish there. I expected a snowstorm just like I'm expecting a few more.''</p>
        <p>Still, in mid-January, Belleayre's business was off 56 percent.</p>
        <p>''It was like a ghost town,'' said Robert Stanley, a councilman in the nearby town of Shandaken who is also a Belleayre instructor. ''You might as well have seen tumbleweeds blowing through the villages.''</p>
        <p>With considerably lower temperatures during much of February, Belleayre has actually had good man-made snow on nearly all of its terrain. But a snowstorm that coated suburban lawns and city streets -- and the deluge of media coverage about gobs of snow in upstate New York -- worked wonders for local commerce.</p>
        <p>''Once the snow fell, places that had been renting one or two rooms for the weekend were sold out in 24 hours,'' said Don Myers, Belleayre's lodging director.</p>
        <p>Belleayre is unique among the handful of Catskill ski areas. Owned by New York State, it has a decidedly unpretentious atmosphere that some liken to that of a rural skiing experience. The ski school offers $5 and $10 lessons to beginners. From Belleayre's summit, there is a wealth of moderate terrain that scatters the family-centered populace across 47 trails and eight lifts. There is even some old-style, snowcat-serviced backcountry skiing, a twisting, ungroomed, tree-strewn trail called Cathedral Brook.</p>
        <p>Belleayre is less well known than New York's other two state-run areas, Whiteface Mountain near Lake Placid and Gore Mountain in North Creek, both in the Adirondacks. It existed for years in those mountains' shadows and needed attention. Instead, in the 1980s, there was a movement to close Belleayre.</p>
        <p>''The place had the look of death,'' said Joe Kelly, who bought a weekend home in the area in 1976 and later led an organization to save the ski area called the Coalition for Belleayre. ''It just seemed unfair because Belleayre had a lot to offer.''</p>
        <p>Belleayre was saved, and in the last decade the ski area has had a dramatic revival. Snow-making has been improved, new trails cut and the ski school revamped and expanded, and Belleayre has begun to market itself aggressively to other New Yorkers, as well as to skiers and riders in New Jersey and Connecticut.</p>
        <p>THE mountain, which is a two-and-a-half-hour drive from New York City, now averages about 175,000 skier visits during a typical winter. As recently as the late 1990s, the average was only 70,000.</p>
        <p>''Climate change is not going to put the ski industry out of business,'' said Mr. Lanza, who came to Belleayre eight years ago. ''We are healthier as a business than ever. With the technology changes we've seen, we can recover quicker. We'll ski almost six months of the year; we'll be out there in April. As bad as this year started, when all is said and done, we might be only 10 percent off our normal numbers.''</p>
        <p>Even the warmer temperatures this week have not substantially changed snow conditions, and the ski area has remained busy.</p>
        <p>Belleayre has no on-slope lodging, which is certainly hampering its growth. There is a controversial proposal for a large Belleayre Resort that would include a hotel, a golf course and real estate units. The development has been strongly opposed by environmentalists concerned about damage to New York City's Catskill Mountains watershed, and that has made the project a battleground locally and statewide. Some community leaders say they believe there is likely to be a compromise, with a scaled-back development.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, accommodations, shops and restaurants old and new are trying to fill the void. The Hanah Mountain Resort and Country Club has a hilltop location with sweeping views. The most elegant lodging in the area, the Hanah has a large restaurant and indoor pool complex, something that is hard to find in the area. Its rooms and suites average about $250 a night on winter weekends.</p>
        <p>The nearby streets of the tiny village of Margaretville are narrow, but there are restaurants like Summerfields Steakhouse and a few charming shops. The village seems in revival mode, too. The marquee on a closed theater along the main drag in the village reads: ''Coming Soon, a Theatre Near You.''</p>
        <p>The most popular fine dining in the vicinity is the Peekamoose restaurant, just two miles east of Belleayre in Big Indian. Run by Devin and Marybeth Mills, who have long experience in the New York and Boston restaurant scenes, Peekamoose features local cuisine, including trout, braised short ribs, caramelized onion tart with locally made goat cheese, and an organic farmer's vegetable platter.</p>
        <p>Sunday, seated on the Belleayre lodge sun deck were Kassie DePaiva, an actress on the television soap opera ''One Life to Live,'' and her husband, Jim, also an actor. The DePaivas have had a home in the Belleayre area since 1998. Asked why they chose to spend their winter weekends in the Catskills rather than in the Rockies or Vermont, Ms. DePaiva answered: ''Why not here? Why get on a plane or drive five hours? This is all the mountain you need.''</p>
        <p>Mr. DePaiva said, ''We won't get anything there that we can't get here.''</p>
        <p>Around them, the music played. There was new snow underfoot, and the sun was out. The group giggle continued.</p>
