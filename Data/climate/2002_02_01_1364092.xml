        <p>The California Assembly passed a bill on Wednesday that would set the  first standards in the nation for regulating automotive emissions of a greenhouse gas.

        <p>The California Assembly passed a bill on Wednesday that would set the  first standards in the nation for regulating automotive emissions of a greenhouse gas. Environmentalists viewed the action as a major victory, but automakers, which are expected to challenge regulation in court if the bill becomes law, criticized it.</p>
        <p>The bill passed 42 to 24, which barely exceeded the 41 votes needed for passage. Only two Republicans voted for the bill, and no Democrats opposed it. Ten Democrats and 4 Republicans did not vote.</p>
        <p>The bill is expected to have an easier time in the Senate, also ruled by Democrats, and with Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat.</p>
        <p>The bill would regulate tailpipe emission of carbon dioxide, which many scientists believe is the chief contributor to global warming. It would require the California Air Resources Board to write the regulations by January 2004 and put them into effect by January 2005.</p>
        <p>The auto industry argues that while catalytic converters can reduce pollution from cars and trucks, the only way to reduce emission of carbon dioxide is to drive less.</p>
        <p>''There is no device you can add to a vehicle to reduce carbon dioxide,'' said Gloria J. Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which includes the Big Three and Toyota.</p>
        <p>As a result, the alliance said, federal fuel economy regulations would pre-empt any action by California.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists argue that improvements can be made with more efficient tires and fuels and by encouraging public transportation.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot of ways the car companies could meet this obligation without addressing the actual fuel economy under the hood,'' said Julia Levin, the California policy coordinator for the Union of Concerned Scientists.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists said action in California could have broad effects.</p>
        <p>''The world's largest auto market is about to begin controlling global warming pollution from automobiles,'' said Daniel F. Becker, director of global warming for the Sierra Club, ''and that puts an enormous amount of pressure on the Congress and the auto industry.''</p>
        <p>But automakers, who expect a drop in sales and face declining profits and having to lay off tens of thousands of workers, are not eager for new regulations.</p>
        <p>''It's a very big issue,'' Ms. Bergquist said, ''and based on prior experience, we fear the worst.''</p>
        <p>For environmentalists, the California Assembly's action is the best news on global warming since their setback last year when the Bush administration announced that the United States would not sign the Kyoto Protocol, a global plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
        <p>Not all automakers are as firm as the Big Three in opposing action on greenhouse gases. Honda, which is not a member of the automotive alliance, said yesterday that it was not against regulating such emissions but opposed it at the state level.</p>
        <p>'' ''If the states act unilaterally,'' Ed Cohen, Honda's vice president of government and industry relations, said, ''we'll end up with a patchwork of approaches.''</p>
