        <p>LEAD: There is probably no plot of ground in the United States with more historical monuments and markers than the battlefield here where the tide of the Civil War turned.</p>
        <p>There is probably no plot of ground in the United States with more historical monuments and markers than the battlefield here where the tide of the Civil War turned.</p>
        <p>Dotting the green fields and gentle wooded hills of the 4,000-acre Gettysburg National Military Park are 1,600 statues, obelisks and tablets, some stone, some metal, all commemorating the three-day struggle of July 1 to 3, 1863, which left 51,000 of the 172,000 soldiers involved dead or wounded.</p>
        <p>There are so many monuments and markers here that in places it seems that a deliberate effort has been made to prove that Abraham Lincoln was wrong when he declared in his Gettysburg Address that ''in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate - we cannot consecrate - we cannot hallow -this ground.''</p>
        <p>Now, as Lincoln might have put it, the National Park Service, which administers the Military Park, is engaged in a great test, trying to determine whether these monuments and markers can long endure. The problem is acid rain. More acid rain falls on Pennsylvania than on almost any other state, and it is slowly, but inexorably, eating away every statue and tablet made of bronze, limestone or sandstone.</p>
        <p>On Cemetery Hill, the lettering and design-work on the marble shaft honoring the Pennsylvania gunners who fought there is so badly eroded that only a pair of crossed cannon can still be made out. On the site where Lincoln gave his speech, the facial features, finger tips and clothing folds of the figures on the Soldiers' National Monument have been scoured smooth. And over on Seminary Ridge, the jumping off point for Gen. George E. Pickett's ill-fated brigades, greenish-blue corrosion eats away at bronze heroes, underscoring the urgency of a Park Service report on acid rain that warns, ''Only memories last forever.''</p>
        <p>Pennsylvania is especially hard hit by acid rain because it is in a part of the country where coal-powered plants abound. The smoke from burning coal contains sulfur dioxide, believed to be the key destructive element in the formation of acid rain, which not only corrodes stone and metal but can also poison fauna and flora. Only recently, President Bush suggested tightening clean air laws to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions.</p>
        <p>''Every time it rains. . .drip, drip, drip. . .we lose a little more metal, a little more stone,'' said David Ballard, the maintenance director for the Military Park. ''It's a disastrous combination when you've got more monuments than anybody else and more acid rain than anybody else. The damage has been particularly serious over the past 10 years, and it's getting even worse. We've got to do something.''</p>
        <p>The Park Service is conducting tests on what treatments work best to slow or halt the effects of acid rain. Park scientists have gathered numerous water samples and park engineers have experimented with various cleaning and coating solutions, some new and some tried in other places.</p>
        <p>''We haven't found the real answer yet,'' Mr. Ballard said. ''But I think we're making a little bit of progress.''</p>
        <p>Park maintenance crews at first tried cleaning the eroding monuments and markers with commercial solutions and brushes. But engineers concluded that many of the cleansers themselves were destructive and that brushing and scraping could also be harmful if they were not carried out with extreme care.</p>
        <p>Eventually, the crews turned to a technique that involves removing corrosion with a pressurized stream of pulverized walnut shells, which cuts corrosion but not does not damage metal or stone. The cleaned monument is then coated with a protective wax.</p>
        <p>''It's one answer but not the final answer,'' Mr. Ballard said. ''The problem is you have to repeat the process about every 12 to 18 months, and it's labor intensive and therefore costly.''</p>
        <p>For all the Park Service's concern about the corrosion, the Military Park's annual maintenance budget of $1.4 million does not yet include the $300,000 that Mr. Ballard figures would be required to blast and wax year-round. ''We find funding where we can,'' he said, ''but we don't have enough.''</p>
        <p>Much of it has come from private sources, including military clubs and veterans groups. Many monuments were originally erected by such organizations in honor of local units or hometown heroes, and Mr. Ballard has mailed out ''adopt-a-monument'' fliers in an effort to tap this source once again.</p>
        <p>''A number of clubs and groups, even some states and towns, have responded,'' he said. ''The South has been particularly good about coming up with money, better than the North. But I wouldn't hazard a guess as to why.''</p>
