        <p>HARTFORD, May 6 - As investigators search for a possible link between benefits given to Gov. John G. Rowland and the awarding of state contracts, the Connecticut General Assembly ended its session early Thursday by passing legislation that altered gift-disclosure rules for contractors who seek state work.</p>

        <p>As investigators search for a possible link between benefits given to Gov. John G. Rowland and the awarding of state contracts, the Connecticut General Assembly ended its session early Thursday by passing legislation that altered gift-disclosure rules for contractors who seek state work.</p>
        <p>As of Oct. 1, when the new law takes effect, contractors seeking state work must either swear they have not given gifts to a public official or state employee for two years or disclose any gifts made within that period.</p>
        <p>Since January, after Mr. Rowland disclosed he had received free work on his Litchfield cottage from people doing business with the state, the Connecticut attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, has required a 10-year review period for each contract its office approves. The new legislation replaces that requirement.</p>
        <p>But in an atmosphere ripe for the initiative, the legislature also passed new and tougher ethics laws. Ethics violations that were once misdemeanors will be felonies -- carrying the potential for an increased prison sentence. The penalties for some violations were increased to $10,000 from $2,000 and the statute of limitations on violations was extended to five years from three.</p>
        <p>The budgets for the State Ethics Commission and some other watchdog agencies were kept intact, but one agency, the Office of the Child Advocate, whose duties include oversight of the state's embattled child welfare agency, did not get the $70,000 needed for a staff lawyer.</p>
        <p>Since lawmakers are in the second year of a two-year budget cycle, they had only to grapple with adjustments. By a veto-proof margin in both chambers, they passed a $14.3 billion budget that called for no new taxes. Unhappy that none of a projected $224 million surplus was earmarked for the state's Rainy Day Fund, Mr. Rowland did not deliver the customary session-ending address, but later he said he would approve the budget and not exercise his line-item veto.</p>
        <p>On Thursday afternoon, Mr. Rowland, whose legendary powers of persuasion in the Democratic-controlled legislature have been blunted by scandal, fielded questions about his role in the session.</p>
        <p>He played down assertions by reporters that Republicans had agreed to the budget only because the scandal put them in a weakened position. ''It's a very attractive budget, and on top of that it reduces taxes,'' he said. ''I don't think anybody voted this budget for John Rowland.''</p>
        <p>But his fellow Republicans conceded that his customary role was diminished.</p>
        <p>''The governor did not lead the agenda this session the way he has in the past,'' said Robert M. Ward, the House minority leader.</p>
        <p>Kevin B. Sullivan, a Democrat who is president pro tempore of the Senate, said Mr. Rowland's being ''preoccupied'' and ''out of the loop'' helped, rather than hurt, bipartisan efforts.</p>
        <p>''It actually galvanized the legislature in ways I haven't seen,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the short session, the already-approved budget and an unexpected surplus -- a $200 million deficit was forecast last fall -- allowed lawmakers to wrap up the year with more ease than usual. Yet since they could not agree on a bond package, they must return for a special session that is tentatively scheduled for next week.</p>
        <p>Some medical malpractice insurance reforms passed, including regulation of lawyers' fees in malpractice cases and increased oversight duty by the State Insurance Commissioner. But Mr. Rowland said the measures merely ''create the illusion that this legislature has done something significant in this area.'' He said he would veto any legislation that does not cap damages for pain and suffering in medical malpractice awards.</p>
        <p>Cities and towns will receive an additional $40 million in education aid shared by all 169 towns and $34 million more was approved for early-reading programs, special education and magnet schools under the budget approved by lawmakers.</p>
        <p>On the environmental front, a plan to reduce greenhouse gases was approved, and the moratorium on utility transmission lines across Long Island Sound was extended for a year.</p>
        <p>Some other proposals did not pass. Democrats flirted once again with higher taxes for the state's millionaires and Mr. Rowland had proposed an increase in so-called sin taxes on things like cigarettes and alcohol, but neither was approved.</p>
        <p>Although a property tax credit was increased to $500 from $350 for 2005, a homestead exemption to ameliorate proposed property tax increases due to re-evaluation was not enacted.</p>
        <p>And the session ended without decision-making legislation on several controversial matters, including gay marriage, stem cell research and medical marijuana.</p>
        <p>Just hours before the session's close, Mr. Rowland's problems rippled through the Hall of the House. John Wayne Fox, the co-chairman of the impeachment inquiry committee, was signing subpoenas for documents about a trip the governor took to an insurance industry conference in Florida last year.</p>
