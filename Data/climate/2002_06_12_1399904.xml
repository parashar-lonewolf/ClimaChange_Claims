        <p>ALBANY, June 11  Gov. George E. Pataki's task force on global warming is weighing ambitious recommendations for reducing greenhouse gases, ideas that go far beyond what any other state has done.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki's task force on global warming is weighing ambitious recommendations for reducing greenhouse gases, ideas that go far beyond what any other state has done.</p>
        <p>But the task force is divided over those proposals, as are administration officials, who say that some of them could survive to become state policy, while others clearly will not.</p>
        <p>The recommendations were drafted by a consulting firm, not by the task force the governor appointed last year, which has been unable to achieve unanimity on any of the issues. A member of the task force who favors the recommendations gave a copy to The New York Times.</p>
        <p>The central proposal is to limit power plant emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, to 40 percent below 1990 levels, by 2010. That would reduce carbon dioxide far more over the next decade than all the other measures combined. Other steps would include requiring that 6 percent of new electric power production come from renewable sources like solar and wind power.</p>
        <p>Another recommendation, to limit carbon dioxide from vehicle tailpipes, will not be adopted, state officials said, because of what everyone involved agrees are technological and legal obstacles.</p>
        <p>Task force members say all sides were surprised by the aggressiveness of the plans produced by the consultant, the Center for Clean Air Policy, a group based in Washington that is widely used and respected by Republicans and Democrats, industries and environmental groups. The results elated the environmentalists on the panel and dismayed most of the business representatives, who include officials of Ford Motor Company, Alcoa and Reliant Energy, a major power plant owner.</p>
        <p>By setting the bar so high, the report has left the Pataki administration in an uncomfortable position. It is clear that any policies the state adopts will be less ambitious than the consultant's report, and the administration has asked the Center for Clean Air Policy to draft a less far-reaching version for public release in the next few weeks. Administration officials have all but given up on the idea of recommendations from the task force itself because there is no consensus.</p>
        <p>Aides to the governor fear that as Mr. Pataki runs for re-election, Democrats and environmentalists will accuse him of retreating from the recommendations under pressure from business -- even if in the end, he makes New York a national leader on global warming. The aides were not pleased to learn that the original report had been leaked to a reporter.</p>
        <p>''This is not a consensus document, and it is not a final document,'' said John P. Cahill, the governor's chief of staff and chairman of the task force. ''A lot of this will be doable and achievable.''</p>
        <p>Environmental groups are mounting a public relations campaign to pressure the governor to adopt firm limits on carbon dioxide from power plants, timed to coincide with the task force's deliberations.</p>
        <p>In the last three years, Mr. Pataki has moved toward requiring reductions in pollution from power plants, but he has resisted calls to include limits on carbon dioxide. Only two states, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, have capped carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, and neither has gone as far as a 40 percent reduction.</p>
        <p>Pataki aides said the governor might adopt a cap, but it would probably be less stringent than 40 percent, and his preference would be a regional approach by all the Northeast states. The recommendation that 6 percent of power come from ''renewables'' has a better chance of becoming state policy, they said.</p>
        <p>In appointing the task force last year, the governor said he wanted New York to lead the nation in combating global warming. But administration officials on the task force are nearly as divided on the issues as the other members are. They say that getting too far ahead of other states would harm the ability of New York businesses to compete economically.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cahill said a crucial question is this: ''What can New York do on its own without being placed at a complete competitive disadvantage?''</p>
        <p>But environmentalists contend that the clear message from the consultant's research is that deep cuts in carbon dioxide emissions would be easier to achieve than anyone previously suspected. New York, they say, has an opportunity to be a model that the nation would follow.</p>
        <p>''Our view is if you don't do a carbon cap on the power industry, you haven't done much,'' said Anne Reynolds, project director at Environmental Advocates and a member of the task force. ''It's the single most important thing New York can do on global warming.''</p>
        <p>An industry representative on the task force said, ''We think the recommendations are unrealistic and damaging, and we've made that view plain to the governor's office.''</p>
        <p>No practical way has been developed to capture carbon dioxide emissions from power plant smokestacks -- or, for that matter, from vehicle tailpipes. So, other than conservation, the only ways to reduce the carbon dioxide output are to make the machinery more fuel-efficient and to move away from dirtier fuels like coal and toward cleaner ones like natural gas. That process is already under way, as new plants are built and older ones are overhauled.</p>
        <p>As a result, the Center for Clean Air Policy concluded, power plants' output of carbon dioxide will drop to 28 percent below 1990 levels by 2010, even without any further state action -- indicating that 40 percent is within reach. Without a state mandate, the center found, emissions would begin to rise again after 2010.</p>
        <p>''What the analysis in this report really shows is that New York is capable of going even further than we thought,'' said Ashok Gupta of the Natural Resources Defense Council, a member of the task force. ''And that's what we should do.''</p>
