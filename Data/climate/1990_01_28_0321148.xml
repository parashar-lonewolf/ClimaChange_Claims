        <p>LEAD: Aiming at both a greening of America and a cooling of the world, President Bush will announce in his State of the Union Message next week a program to increase the nation's tree cover by a billion trees a year for the next 10 years, Administration officials say.</p>
        <p>Aiming at both a greening of America and a cooling of the world, President Bush will announce in his State of the Union Message next week a program to increase the nation's tree cover by a billion trees a year for the next 10 years, Administration officials say.</p>
        <p>The reforestation program, whose cost over the next decade would approach $2 billion, is intended to help ameliorate the global warming expected to occur as a result of pollution.</p>
        <p>The program is to be run by the Forest Service, and the President will propose to Congress in his budget Monday that $175 million be devoted to it. The program envisages annual outlays of a similar amount for a decade.</p>
        <p>Conservationists said the program, by itself, would do little to combat pollution-caused global warming, but they welcomed it as an important symbolic step.</p>
        <p>The program would entail not only the planting of new trees but also the improvement of land to enhance tree growth. It would be undertaken in national forests, on privately owned rural property and in urban areas.</p>
        <p>Bush Environmental Initiatives</p>
        <p>The program is the latest of a series of initiatives by Mr. Bush to establish his credentials as an environmentally minded President, in contrast to President Ronald Reagan, who was widely criticized by environmental groups. On Wednesday, for example, Mr. Bush announced that he would support the elevation of the Environmental Protection Agency to Cabinet status, a goal of most environmentalists for years.</p>
        <p>Polls and this year's Congressional agenda, in which environmental issues will be an important theme, show that environmental protection is a potent issue supported by a broad spectrum of the public.</p>
        <p>Administration aides say Mr. Bush is genuinely concerned about global warming, genuinely wants to beautify America and is genuinely fond of trees.</p>
        <p>The aides said that in addition to combating global warming linked to pollution, the program was intended to enhance the beauty of the countryside and cities, help conserve energy, protect soil and water quality, and contribute to other enviromental goals.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush will call for a major volunteer effort to join in the tree-planting campaign. Aides said the President regards voluntarism as an important component of the program and hopes to enlist groups like the Boy Scouts and the Garden Clubs of America. He will ask for private corporations to help pay for the effort.</p>
        <p>Reaction to Global Warming</p>
        <p>In part, the program is intended as this nation's first significant policy response to the rapid warming of the globe projected by scientists in the next century as a result of the accumulation of carbon dioxide and other gases released by human activity into the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>These gases trap infrared radiation from the sun that would othewise be reflected back into space, causing the earth's temperature to rise, in a process similar to what happens in a greenhouse. The current consensus among scientists appears to be that the average global temperature will rise by 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit or more by the middle of the next century.</p>
        <p>Trees and other green vegetation absorb carbon dioxide and give off oxygen during photosynthesis. Planting more trees, therefore, would absorb some of the carbon dioxide emitted by human combustion of fossil fuels and help temper the magnitude and speed of the greenhouse effect.</p>
        <p>Mark C. Trexler, director of the carbon sequestration forestry project of the World Resources Institute, a nonprofit research and policy group here, said planting an additional billion trees a year for 10 years could absorb about 1 to 3 percent of the carbon dioxide produced by human activity in the United States. This country produces 1.3 billion tons of carbon dioxide a year, nearly 25 percent of the total that enters the global atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Both the E.P.A. and the Agriculture Department had recommended more extensive programs. The E.P.A. last year proposed a reforestation effort that would cut 10 percent of the nation's annual carbon dioxide pollution, and the Agriculture Department offered a plan for a 5 percent reduction. The White House rejected the more ambitious efforts because they would have entailed renting land from farmers on which to plant trees.</p>
        <p>Conservationists emphasized that planting trees alone would not make any major reduction in the global warming trend. Substantial additional efforts would be required, they insisted, particularly a sizable reduction in the consumption of oil and coal, which emit large amounts of carbon dioxide when burned.</p>
