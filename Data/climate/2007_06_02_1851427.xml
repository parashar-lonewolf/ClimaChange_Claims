        <p>Vermont has long been a muse for poets and painters, but rappers have never been known to draw inspiration from its bucolic landscapes and postcard-perfect small towns.</p>
        <p>Until now.</p>
        <p>The quiet streets and low crime rates of Vermont have worked their way into the hip-hop world, thanks to a rap video called ''802,'' made by three students at Montpelier High School.</p>
        <p>''Up in Vermont, this is how we do, we got one area code, and it's 802,'' rap Colin Arisman and Luke Martin, who wear white polo shirts and start the video by hopping out of a white Toyota Scion.</p>
        <p>The rap, at www.youtube.com/watch?v=GL7uW4TYqbs, pokes fun at Vermont institutions and stereotypes like dairy products and snowplows.</p>
        <p>''Green Mountain State, where we roll on skis, don't mess with our cows or we'll break your knees,'' go the rappers, who perform under the name X10.</p>
        <p>Colin, Luke and their main man Kevin Hartmann wrote ''802'' in September after tossing around verses with a group of friends after school. They shot the video in the fall but did not post it on the Internet until early May. It has been viewed more than 55,000 times since then.</p>
        <p>''It went crazier than we ever thought,'' said Kevin, 16, who shot, produced and posted the video, and calls himself Dr. K.</p>
        <p>The boys had planned to pen a rap only about Montpelier, the state capital, where just a handful of establishments are open past 10 p.m., cars stop for pedestrians along clean streets, and teenage loitering on Main Street is the only thing that comes even close to outward flouting of the law.</p>
        <p>Instead, they decided to rap about all of Vermont, having concluded that the state could not get by on street cred alone. They included lines about Cabot cheese (they like cheddar ''extra sharp,'' which they rhymed with ''roof tarp''), local pizza places and the Vermont State House, where, along with the streets of Montpelier, most of the video was shot.</p>
        <p>''Our state capitol might be 200 years old, but our dome is so blingin' that it's plated with gold,'' goes ''802,'' which is set to the beat of a Mobb Deep rap.</p>
        <p>The most prominent employee in the building, Gov. Jim Douglas, has seen the video.</p>
        <p>''We're down with that,'' said Jason Gibbs, a spokesman for Mr. Douglas.</p>
        <p>X10 plans to make a political statement with its next rap, in support of a global warming bill currently before the overwhelmingly Democratic state legislature. Mr. Douglas, a third-term Republican, may not enjoy that video as much; he has said he will veto the measure.</p>
        <p>Colin, 17, whose moniker is C$ (pronounced C money), likened the creating of ''802'' to writing a term paper. The rappers, who are all in the midst of SAT preparation, said they had taken something of an intellectual turn in their video, using words like ''fustigating'' and avoiding profanity.</p>
        <p>''I don't think a big SAT vocabulary is what a lot of rappers are looking for,'' Colin said, ''but if it enhances your writing, that's good.''</p>
        <p>In any case, the goal was to show that Vermonters can poke fun at themselves.</p>
        <p>''We're small, we might be a little boring, but we can have fun,'' Kevin said. ''We have a sense of humor.''</p>
