        <p>Under fire from environmental organizations and from his opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio yesterday stopped broadcasting a radio advertisement that criticized Hillary Rodham Clinton for supporting an environmental treaty on global warming.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio abruptly removed the ad as his campaign was pulled deeper into a bitter dispute with Mrs. Clinton over another issue -- Muslim-American support for her campaign. A New York official of the American Muslim Alliance accused Mr. Lazio of hypocrisy for soliciting campaign donations from him more than a dozen times in the last several months.</p>
        <p>Criticism about both issues seemed to throw his campaign into confusion by day's end. Mr. Lazio, scrambling to try to explain his views on the global warming treaty, known as the Kyoto Protocol, and on the money dispute, had his driver pull over last night at a gas station on his way to a dinner in Queens and climbed into the reporters'  van following him to spend six minutes answering questions.</p>
        <p>Lazio campaign officials decided to stop broadcasting the radio advertisement after Mrs. Clinton and several prominent environmental groups, including one that endorsed both candidates, defended the treaty and accused Mr. Lazio of distorting its intent.</p>
        <p>The Kyoto treaty, which was signed by the United States in 1998 but has not yet been ratified by the Senate, requires countries to reduce consumption of oil and other fossil fuels to help fight global warming. Many Republicans, including Mr. Lazio, have expressed concerns about the treaty because some of the world's biggest polluters, including China and India, have not signed it.  Opponents of the treaty fear many large industries would relocate from the United States to nonsigning nations if the treaty is ratified.</p>
        <p>By early evening, though, the environmental issue had been overshadowed by the latest round of recriminations in the candidates' feud over Muslim support.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has repeatedly attacked Mrs. Clinton for attending a fund-raiser organized last June by the American Muslim Alliance chapter in Massachusetts. Last week, she returned $50,000 in contributions collected at the event -- donations Mr. Lazio characterized as ''blood money.''</p>
        <p>In interviews on the telephone and at his home yesterday in Jericho on Long Island, Faroque A. Khan, the leader of the group's New York chapter, said he had received, on average, two solicitation letters a week from the Lazio campaign since Mr. Lazio entered the Senate race in May. He has even received a Lazio bumper sticker in the mail.</p>
        <p>Mr. Khan produced several of the mailings, the most recent of which was dated Oct. 23. All of them appear to be general mailings, sent out by the campaign. In the most recent letter, Mr. Lazio says that Mrs. Clinton has ''flip-flopped'' on the issue of terrorism and ''shrugged off her warm embrace'' of Suha Arafat. ''It is going to cost him the election,'' Mr. Khan said. ''He tells us that Hillary is terrible and horrible for taking our money, and then he asks for it himself. He has really energized and solidified thousands of people who wouldn't have gone to the polls otherwise.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's campaign, which throughout the day had tried to divert attention from the Muslim American dispute to focus on her chosen issue of the day -- Social Security -- last night echoed the criticism by Mr. Khan.</p>
        <p>''You are left wondering six days before the election what Rick Lazio believes or whether he believes anything at all,'' said Howard Wolfson, her campaign spokesman. ''Did he think he could get away with this without anybody noticing?''</p>
        <p>But inside the press van last night, Mr. Lazio said the fund-raising mailing was a form letter, and described Mr. Khan's criticism as false.</p>
        <p>''We have sent out 18 million pieces of mail,'' Mr. Lazio said. ''I'm sure a number of those who have received that mail have been supporters of Hillary Clinton. As far as I know and I understand, we have not received a dime from any person that supports terrorism as a legitimate political tool.''</p>
        <p>Earlier in the day, Mr. Lazio, in campaign stops that focused on an appeal to Jewish voters, declared directly that he did not believe in the creation of a Palestinian state, suggesting that it would not endure and would upset the stability of the region. Mr. Lazio has criticized Mrs. Clinton for saying she supported the creation of a Palestinian state before, but today he directly questioned the wisdom of a step that had been advocated by a number of Israeli  leaders, at least before this latest round of violence, as a way of constructing a lasting peace agreement.</p>
        <p>''If you ask me what my personal opinion is, I am not a supporter of a Palestinian state,'' Mr. Lazio said after speaking to boys at the Yeshiva of South Shore in Hewlett, on Long Island. He added: ''I believe that that's going to be in the end up to the people and the government of Israel to agree. But if you ask me what my personal opinion -- I don't believe in one.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio said that he did not believe that ''full statehood'' would be ''sustainable from a security standpoint for Israel.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Lazio spoke, Assemblyman Dov Hikind, a Brooklyn Democrat who is a leading Orthodox Jew, and whose support had been courted by both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Lazio, said that he had decided to stay neutral in the race. Mr. Hikind has had a history of endorsing Republicans in recent years and had been critical of Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hikind would not say what caused him not to endorse; however, it came after a week in which Mrs. Clinton had come under attack by some Jewish New Yorkers for accepting and then returning donations from American Muslims.</p>
        <p>''I am convinced that should Hillary Clinton get elected -- as well as Lazio -- that they will effectively represent the interests of New York, specifically Jewish New Yorkers,'' he said. ''I feel very good that way, in spite of her past record that angers so many of us, and I've expressed that anger directly at Hillary.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, in an appearance at  the Riverdale Senior Center yesterday afternoon, would not discuss Mr. Hikind's decision. She also would not respond to claims by several Muslim American organizations on Tuesday that Mr. Lazio had introduced racism and bigotry into the campaign by criticizing her support among Muslim Americans.</p>
        <p>''I will leave that to others to characterize,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Asked about her views on a Palestinian state, she said that she does not support a unilateral declaration of statehood, but would support the creation of such an entity if it were part of a comprehensive peace agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Her opponent and others have noted that she advocated an independent state before she became a candidate for public office.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton also criticized Mr. Lazio for broadcasting the environmental ad, insisting he shared her support for the Kyoto agreement. The advertisement accuses Mrs. Clinton of backing a ''radical environmental treaty that would wipe out thousands of manufacturing jobs in New York.''</p>
        <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Larry Rockefeller, two leaders of the New York League of Conservation Voters, and members of the Sierra Club, both of which have endorsed Mrs. Clinton, said yesterday that Mr. Lazio told them in interviews during the endorsement process that he would vote for ratification of the treaty. The National League of Conservation Voters, a separate organization based in Washington that endorsed both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Lazio, said Mr. Lazio never promised to ratify the treaty, but a spokeswoman said he clearly ''supported the premise'' of the pact.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio pulled the ad after the Washington group immediately sent him a letter ''strongly requesting'' that it be withdrawn and indicating it ''runs counter to the intent and spirit'' of the group's endorsement, according to Betsy Loyless, the league's political director. Ms. Loyless said there were board members who would have pushed to revoke the endorsement if the ads continued to run.</p>
        <p>''We feel strongly about this issue and applaud Mrs. Clinton,'' Ms. Loyless said. Mr. Lazio said the ad ''was discontinued out of respect'' for the league.</p>
        <p>''My position on Kyoto is consistent and well known,'' Mr. Lazio said. ''I have always said that everybody needs to be in the tent: that we can't create what I call sort of a polluter pass to certain nations like China or India and hold America to a different standard.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio said he had no regrets about the language used to attack the bill in the ad, even when a reporter noted that in September he had described the Kyoto Protocol as ''a laudable attempt to address global warming,'' even as he said the treaty could be improved. ''The final product ended up being something that I couldn't' support,'' he said.</p>
