        <p>LAST week's release of clues that Mars may once have harbored primitive microbes has lent new energy and excitement to a call for close exploration not only of the red planet itself, but of Europa, a moon of Jupiter that some scientists had been independently and quietly examining as a possible home to alien life.</p>
        <p>The common denominator of both worlds is water, a prerequisite for life, at least in this part of the universe.</p>
        <p>Today, Mars is largely a red desert strewn with rocks and many indications that water flowed over its surface billions of years ago, cutting deep channels and filling large lakes. Mars offers no clear signs that liquid water now runs on its surface; its icy polar caps are composed primarily of carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>But Europa, a moon of Jupiter, is completely enveloped by water, either frozen or liquid, believed to be as deep as 60 miles in some places. In contrast, the Earth's seas reach down barely seven miles at most.</p>
        <p>The rub for extraterrestrial life on Europa is that the moon's surface is an icy wasteland. But increasingly, scientists suspect that the Jovian satellite has a hot core and that the inner part of its waters makes up  a gigantic dark sea that may seethe with alien life forms that have quietly evolved over billions of years.</p>
        <p>So great is the biological allure of Europa that even before the announcement about Mars last week, scientists were making plans to hold a meeting to discuss the odds of life arising there and were lobbying for new exploratory missions to the Jovian moon.</p>
        <p>Their excitement has redoubled with the news that a Martian meteorite that fell to Earth contains hints of ancient extraterrestrial life in its recesses.</p>
        <p>''It's fantastic,'' Dr. John R. Delaney, an oceanographer at the University of Washington who is helping to plan the Europa conference, said of the new finding. ''With Mars, we're talking about fossil evidence. But where you have a live heat source and a liquid body, you have the potential for living organisms today.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Joseph A. Burns, a senior planetary scientist at Cornell University who has led national panels that set goals for space exploration, said most experts agreed that after Mars, Europa was the most likely candidate in the solar system for nurturing extraterrestrial life or harboring its fossilized remains. It could be the most likely candidate when it comes to organisms living now.</p>
        <p>Interest in exploration of the Jovian moon is rapidly growing, Dr. Burns said in an interview.</p>
        <p>''Keep in mind that Europa is not that small,'' he said, noting that its radius is about half that of Mars. That makes it roughly the size of Earth's Moon.</p>
        <p>For decades, if not centuries, speculation about the possibility of extraterrestrial life in the solar system focused on planetary surfaces and the idea that the preconditions for living organisms include not only water but also an atmosphere and sunlight, which were seen as providing essential energy and a refuge from the icy cold of space.</p>
        <p>But a main discovery of the late 20th century is that rich ecosystems have flourished on Earth in complete darkness for billions of years, drawing energy from planetary heat rather than sunlight. Increasingly, the intriguing question is whether Earth is unique in this respect.</p>
        <p>On Earth, the ecosystems that exist without sunlight are in the blackness of the deep sea. They were discovered in 1977 off the Galapagos Islands, along a volcanic rift that winds through the depths of the global sea like seams on a baseball. The otherworldly fauna include giant clams and fields of tube worms; the white casings where the worms live are up to 10 feet long.</p>
        <p>It turned out that the dark ecosystems are powered by tiny microbes that thrive on chemicals released along the volcanic rift by Earth's inner heat. The microbes play a role analogous to that of plants in sunlit realms.</p>
        <p>Genetic clues have suggested that such microbes are the ancestors of the earliest forms of life on Earth. The heat-loving microbes have been found to be widespread, thriving not only in hot springs on the ocean floor but also in active volcanic craters, deep oil reservoirs and deep, wet rock. They tend to flourish in areas of extreme heat and pressure, as in the subterranean world.</p>
        <p>In 1992, Dr. Thomas Gold of Cornell University proposed that the microbes might be ubiquitous throughout the upper few miles of Earth's crust, inhabiting the fluid-filled pores, cracks and interstices of rocks while living off Earth's inner heat and chemicals. He calculated that the total mass of this hidden biosphere might rival or exceed that of all surface life.</p>
        <p>''Such life may be widely disseminated in the universe,'' Dr. Gold added in his 1992 paper.</p>
        <p>These kinds of ideas and terrestrial findings have put a new spin on the old question of extraterrestrial life.</p>
        <p>For Mars, the emerging exploratory push fueled by the recent meteorite discovery aims to find evidence of tiny microbes that may flourish deep underground, in the wet and temperate parts of the planet's interior, or, if not such creatures, then fossil remains of them from a bygone era.</p>
        <p>But such theorizing becomes far more provocative when it comes to Europa because its deep waters are envisioned as perhaps harboring a thriving mass of alien creatures.</p>
        <p>Jupiter is the largest planet of the solar system, and its moons are the system's biggest and most mysterious. Europa, with surface temperatures estimated at minus 230 degrees Fahrenheit, has long been considered to be far too cold to support life, its 60 miles of water thought to be frozen solid from top to bottom.</p>
        <p>Scientists have come to believe, however, that Jupiter's very strong gravitational pull keeps its inner moons in a state of geological turmoil. For instance, Io, perhaps the most bizarre satellite in the solar system, is clearly covered by seething volcanoes, which constantly shoot plumes of material into space.</p>
        <p>Slightly farther out, Europa, discovered by Galileo in 1610, has no visible volcanoes but is still considered to be geologically alive. The brightest of Jupiter's 16 moons, it has an icy surface made of water that is cut by deep fractures and is clearly very young, as suggested by the relative lack of scars left by comet and asteroid impacts. The surface fissures are thought to be evidence of such internal planetary dynamics as ocean currents.</p>
        <p>Moreover, scientists now believe that Europa's gravitational interactions with Jupiter, Io and, still farther out, Ganymede, the largest satellite in the solar system, have caused enough internal friction and heating to keep a large part of Europa's water liquid rather than frozen. The surface ice might be up to 5 or 10 miles thick, scientists believe, making the inner liquid ocean quite extensive, perhaps 40 or 50 miles deep.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the rocky floor at the bottom of the conjectural sea might  seethe with the same kind of hot volcanic vents as in the Earth's seas, which could make such hot vents on Europa a womb for the origin of extraterrestrial life.</p>
        <p>''Whether or not there's submarine volcanic activity today on Europa, it surely was happening sometime in the past,'' said Dr. Steven W. Squyres, a planetary scientist at Cornell University who has written since 1983 about the possibility of life on Europa.</p>
        <p>The rising interest in Europa has resulted in plans for a large conference to examine the question of life there. The event is being organized by Dr. Squyres; Dr. Delaney, of the University of Washington, and Dr. Torrence V. Johnson, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Financed by the ocean branch of the National Science Foundation and the exobiology branch of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, it is to be held Nov. 12 to 14 at the San Juan Institute in San Juan Capistrano, Calif.</p>
        <p>A push is also developing to try to extend the length of the Galileo mission so the spacecraft, now orbiting Jupiter, can focus on Europa in its final days. The mission is scheduled to end in December 1997, but mission planners would like to have the spacecraft swing past Europa for a series of close images and analyses in 1998 and 1999.</p>
        <p>The spacecraft has enough fuel for such an endeavor, they say, but it is not known if money would be available to extend the mission. The payoff of such an extension would be the best portrait yet of the moon.</p>
        <p>The first human close encounter with Europa came in 1979 when the Voyager 2 spacecraft passed within 125,000 miles of it and was able to produce startling images of its icy expanse. Today NASA is releasing photographs of Europa taken by the Galileo probe from a distance of about 100,000 miles. In February, Galileo is to fly past Europa at a distance of about 400 miles, repeatedly snapping images.</p>
        <p>''We'll be looking for evidence of eruptions on the surface,'' said Dr. Johnson, of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who is the chief scientist of the Galileo mission to Jupiter and its moons.</p>
        <p>An extended Galileo mission through 1997 and 1998 would enable the probe to sweep close to Europa six to eight more times, greatly increasing the odds of observing the eruption of liquid water into the moon's thin atmosphere, which last year was discovered to be relatively rich in oxygen. Such a mission would look for activity at the fissures on Europa's surface.</p>
        <p>Dr. Johnson said the extended mission might cost $10 million a year, compared with the $50 million it now costs annually to operate the Galileo probe.</p>
        <p>Plans are also under way to study the possibility of sending a small new spacecraft to Europa early in the next century that would orbit the icy moon and probe below its surface with specially designed radar, perhaps settling the question of whether  a hidden ocean exists.</p>
        <p>The wildest of the scientific dreams includes having a piloted submarine explore that extraterrestrial sea, if it exists, in a hunt for new geology and life.</p>
        <p>Of course, that presumes that any aliens living on Europa would allow the arrival of a craft from Earth.</p>
        <p>Arthur C. Clarke, the novelist, over the years has carefully followed scientific theories about the nature of Europa and the possibility that of life beneath its icy surface.</p>
        <p>In his book ''2010,'' the sequel to ''2001: A Space Odyssey,'' Mr. Clarke wrote of an extraterrestrial civilization that beamed a single message to earthlings, repeating it over and over: ''All these worlds are yours -- except Europa. Attempt no landings there.''</p>
