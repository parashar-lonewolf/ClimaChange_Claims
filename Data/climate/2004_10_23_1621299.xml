        <p>Security Firm Managers Allege Deceit on Iraq  Managers of a security firm that won large contracts in Iraq warned their bosses last February of a pattern of fraudulent billing practices, internal company memorandums suggest. The memorandums charge that the security firm, Custer Battles, repeatedly billed occupation authorities for nonexistent services or at grossly inflated prices.</p>

        <p>France's antiterrorist police identified a young French man killed fighting the United States in Iraq, the first confirmed case of what is believed to be a growing stream of Muslims heading from Europe to fight what they regard as a new holy war.</p>

        <p>A British-Iraqi aid worker held hostage by militants made a tearful televised plea, begging the people of Britain and Prime Minister Tony Blair to save her life by withdrawing troops from Iraq. The worker, Margaret Hassan, is the director of CARE International in Iraq.</p>

        <p>A military judge rejected efforts by two soldiers charged in the Abu Ghraib scandal to obtain testimony from military intelligence officers about whether the soldiers were ordered or encouraged to take part in abuse of detainees. The judge ordered the soldiers to stand trial in Baghdad early next year.</p>

        <p>Plan for Incentives Toward Iran  Britain, France and Germany are working to give Iran a last chance to avoid confrontation with the West over its nuclear program by offering incentives to curtail its most sensitive activities. The Iranian government has given no indication that it will accept the plan.</p>

        <p>Search for Chechen Insurgents  The senior law enforcement official in Chechnya said the authorities had nearly captured Aslan Maskhadov, a leader of the Chechen resistance, and that Mr. Maskhadov was planning to surrender soon. The Kremlin has made the capture of insurgent leaders a priority in its effort to quell the Chechen guerrilla war.</p>

        <p>Emissions Treaty Progressing  Russia's lower house of Parliament voted overwhelmingly to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, clearing another hurdle for the international treaty aimed at reducing emissions blamed for global warming.</p>

        <p>North Korean Terms for U.S.  Secretary of State Colin L. Powell is headed to Asia for a tour of Japan, China and South Korea. North Korea set out conditions for regional talks on its nuclear weapons program. The United States must drop its hostile policy, join an economic aid program for the North, and agree to discuss ''South Korea's nuclear problem.''</p>

        <p>Castro Promotes Hearty Image  President Fidel Castro of Cuba, taking pains to demonstrate that he retains firm control after fracturing his knee and arm in a fall at a public event, says he conducted government business by cellphone during an ambulance ride and later refused general anesthesia.</p>

        <p>Republicans Send Recruits To Contest Voters in Ohio  Republican Party officials in Ohio took formal steps to place thousands of recruits inside polling places on Election Day to challenge the qualifications of voters suspected of not being eligible to cast ballots.</p>

        <p>Bush and Kerry on the Trail  President Bush said Americans had to judge who would keep them safer from terrorism, portraying Senator John Kerry as dangerously naïve and so weak on national security that his election would all but invite attacks on the United States.</p>
        <p>A13</p>
        <p>Senator John Kerry, hoping that women's economic anxieties trump their fears of terrorism, vowed to fight for equal pay and minimum-wage increase, more money for education and health coverage for minors.</p>
        <p>A13</p>
        <p>Courting Conservationists  Each campaign is courting the conservationist vote in swing states like Wisconsin and Nevada, mainly among outdoorsmen, though the word ''environment'' came up just once in the three presidential debates.</p>

        <p>Boston Tightens Security  Boston officials plan to impose restrictions on the bars around Fenway Park and are considering discontinuing use of the pepper-spray gun after a Red Sox fan died after being hit by a police pepper-spray projectile after the team's playoff victory.</p>

        <p>Joint Chief Splits With Cabinet  The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has taken a position at odds with the White House in urging Congress to restrict the powers of a new national intelligence director in developing Pentagon budgets.</p>
        <p>A15</p>
        <p>Anti-Radiation Plan Lagging  A plan to stockpile pills to protect against one of the contaminants that could leak from a nuclear power plant in the event of a terrorist attack appears to have slipped through the cracks.</p>

        <p>Plight of Part-Time Soldiers  Thousands of soldiers in the National Guard and Reserves who were injured on duty are navigating a system suited to full-time soldiers.

        <p>Report Points to Dangers At Highway Checkpoints  The National Transportation Safety Board issued a recommendation that the warning signs for an immigration checkpoint at North Hudson, N.Y., gave either too little information for drivers or a dizzying array of directions that could be confusing.

        <p>Nine patients at a Manhattan nursing home were diagnosed with the flu, signaling the first outbreak of the illness in the city this season, the health department said. Two-thirds of the city's nursing homes have not received vaccine shipments.</p>
