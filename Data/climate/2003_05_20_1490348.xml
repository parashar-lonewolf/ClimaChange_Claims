        <p>As the snow melts and tiny hard-shelled wood ticks crawl out of the ground and onto bushes and grass where they wait to be swept away by a warm body, state and federal health officials here have begun a study to determine whether Montana is the home of a new type of tick-borne disease similar to Lyme disease.</p>
        <p>If that is the case, it could join what may be another new tick-borne disease, or perhaps the same one, that has surfaced in Texas and Missouri. Both cause health problems similar to Lyme disease, but not as severe, and both are treatable with antibiotics.</p>
        <p>In the last few years, 5 to 10 cases a year have appeared in Montana, primarily in pockets along the Yellowstone River in central Montana. People have developed a red bull's-eye rash around a tick bite followed by weeks of fatigue and a fever.</p>
        <p>Experts suspect that James A. Ziegler, a former county commissioner in Billings, is among those who have contracted the disease. A tick appeared on his back, and his wife plucked it out and froze it. Three days later a red circle the size of a quarter appeared, and a bone-deep fatigue set in.</p>
        <p>''I'd come home and feel like I'd been hit in the head with a hammer,'' Mr. Ziegler said. A few days after starting antibiotics he began to feel better.</p>
        <p>These are also the symptoms of Lyme disease, but Mr. Ziegler did not test positive for the Lyme disease antibodies, and his tick did not have the spirochete bacteria that causes the disease.</p>
        <p>Montana is the only state that has not had a confirmed case of Lyme disease, officials say. Neither is the disease related to Rocky Mountain spotted fever, a common tick-borne disease in Montana that causes fever and fatigue and if left untreated a rash called black measles and in some cases death.</p>
        <p>''We know what it isn't,'' said Dr. Todd Damrow, the state epidemiologist in Helena. ''But we don't know what it is. What I think has happened is that a Lyme-disease-like agent has adapted to the wood tick.''</p>
        <p>Lyme disease is carried by deer ticks, and there are no deer ticks in Montana.</p>
        <p>To find out more, Montana officials recently began running advertisements asking that people who find embedded wood ticks to save them in a plastic bags and take them to a designated lab. The best way to extract an engorged tick is to pinch it close to the skin and firmly pull.</p>
        <p>If someone whose tick is on file contracts the signature rash and falls ill, the tick will be ground up, and a DNA analysis of bacteria in the tick will be conducted to see whether it matches known pathogens.</p>
        <p>''It could be new,'' said Dr. Tom Schwan, a senior investigator at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories here, which is part of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health.</p>
        <p>''It could be something similar to what's happening in Texas and Missouri. It would be really exciting if there was a new agent,'' added Dr. Schwan, who will conduct the DNA analysis.</p>
        <p>A previously unidentified kind of infectious agent has also shown up in Lone Star ticks, found in Texas, and in dog ticks in Missouri, with symptoms similar to the Montana disease. The symptoms include fever and a distinctive rash, but generally do not include the more serious Lyme symptoms, which can involve neurological and cardiac symptoms.</p>
        <p>If the illness is a new disease, it will join 10 other tick-borne illnesses. Then, experts will develop new diagnostic tests and map out a course of treatment.</p>
        <p>''Tick-borne disease have always been here in low prevalence,'' Dr. Schwan said ''But an increase of deer, rodents and humans living together in forested situations has caused an increase.''</p>
        <p>The Rocky Mountain lab here, which is investigating the Montana illness, was founded in the early 1900's, when a mysterious disease known as the black measles ravaged settlers in the Bitterroot Valley, and was fatal in four of five cases. But no large outbreak occurred; the largest death toll in a single year was 17.</p>
        <p>The disease turned out to be Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and the lab has since become part of the National Institutes of Health. It studies emerging infections as diverse as the plague and transmissible spongiform encephalopathies also known as mad cow and chronic wasting disease.</p>
        <p>In 1982, Dr. Willy Burgdorfer, a researcher at the lab, identified the agent that causes Lyme disease, a spirochete bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi, which is the shape of a spiral. Lyme disease and spotted fever are caused by different spirochete bacteria in the genus Borrelia. All Borrelia bacteria are spread by certain blood-feeding insects, like ticks and fleas.</p>
        <p>Ticks use blood from their prey as a food to produce eggs. They wait along the ends of vegetation and sense prey through carbon dioxide in exhalations. After they land on a body they spend four or five days finding a good spot, drilling a hole and, toward the end of their stay, injecting a moisture resistant glue so they remain attached as they fill. The last 24 hours of the ride they fill with blood -- called the big sip -- and then drop off and lay their eggs in the ground. A single meal can last five years.</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 27, 2003, Tuesday  An article in Science Times last Tuesday about efforts to identify a tick-borne disease in Montana misstated the genus of the bacterium that causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever, another tick-related illness common to the region. It is Rickettsia, not Borrelia.</p>
