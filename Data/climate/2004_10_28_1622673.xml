        <p>Politics, and political filmmaking, were the talk of Hollywood this summer, a buzz fueled by the bitterness of the presidential campaign and unexpected box-office success of ''Fahrenheit 9/11.'' But on the eve of the election -- and, more relevantly, as the holidays approach -- studio offerings are reverting to form.</p>
        <p>Universal Pictures' ''Ray,'' expected to appear in about 2,000 theaters, is a musical biography of Ray Charles constructed around dilemmas far more human than political, including his long struggle with drug addiction. ''Birth,'' from New Line Cinema's Fine Line art film unit, is a psychological thriller about a woman, played by Nicole Kidman, wrestling with the notion that a child is her dead husband reincarnate.</p>
        <p>''Saw,'' meanwhile, adds a dose of pre-Halloween horror from Lions Gate Entertainment, one of the companies that created a stir by releasing Michael Moore's anti-Bush polemic ''Fahrenheit 9/11.''</p>
        <p>''Escapism is the No. 1 thing people are looking for,'' John Hegeman, Lions Gate's president of worldwide marketing, said in describing the current mood of the national audience.</p>
        <p>Despite a boom in politically flavored documentaries this year, Mr. Hegeman said his company had none on its schedule for future release. The combined grosses of documentaries released in the first 10 months of 2004 accounted for nearly half the money taken in at the box office by documentaries since 1982, according to boxofficemojo.com. That's a seismic shift, even if the figures are adjusted for inflation.</p>
        <p>''You have two choices when there's fear and the unknown'' in society, Mr. Hegeman said. ''You can look to escape or you can look to gain knowledge.''</p>
        <p>Despite much hoopla and considerable media attention, politically oriented films like Paramount's ''Team America: World Police,'' which has taken in only about $23 million so far, and ''The Manchurian Candidate'' (also a Paramount release), with about $66 million in ticket sales, have been disappointments at the box office.</p>
        <p>By contrast, ''Fahrenheit,'' the year's highest-grossing political movie, rose to 12th place in the box-office rankings, setting a record for feature-length documentaries. Yet, the film's $119 million gross remains a small fraction of the dollars taken in by fantasies like DreamWorks' ''Shrek 2,'' which ranks No. 1 to date with $440 million in ticket sales in the United States, or Sony Pictures' ''Spider-Man 2,'' which has taken in $373 million.</p>
        <p>People go to the movies seeking ''mythic solace for reality,'' said Leo Braudy, a professor of American literature and cinema at the University of Southern California. They want, he said, diverting displacements for their anxieties, soothing allegories for their fears.</p>
        <p>Though fierce discussion swirled around issues in ''The Passion of the Christ,'' which so far ranks No. 3 for the year with $370 million in ticket sales, and ''The Day After Tomorrow,'' the global warming disaster movie, with $187 million, neither supports an argument that the public was hungry for political filmmaking.</p>
        <p>And the audience appetite for the year's many documentaries critiquing corporate behavior and the war in Iraq was minuscule, though larger than it has been in the past, pointing to a continuing preference for standard fare. After ''Fahrenheit,'' the next highest grossing documentary, in 106th place according to a boxofficemojo.com ranking, was ''Super Size Me,'' about the fast-food industry and its effects on Americans' health.</p>
        <p>''Watching someone eat himself to death on hamburgers isn't the biggest audience draw,'' said Peter Biskind, the author of ''Down and Dirty Pictures: Miramax, Sundance and the Rise of Independent Film.''</p>
        <p>Other documentaries that attracted critical attention this year, like ''The Corporation'' and ''The Control Room,'' remained relatively marginal at the box office, as did the director John Sayles's politically driven though fictional ''Silver City,'' which took in only about $1 million in ticket sales.</p>
        <p>Still, many mainstream Hollywood filmmakers see the latest wave of documentary movies as an encouraging development.</p>
        <p>''We may see a marketplace that exists beside narrative moviemaking,'' said Marc Shmuger, vice chairman of Universal Pictures. ''That would be a great thing. I take my kids. To have a generation that can grow up with documentaries as well as with popcorn movies is something that I look forward to.''</p>
