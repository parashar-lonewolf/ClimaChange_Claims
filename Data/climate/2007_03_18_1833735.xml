        <p>KEVIN LAW, Gov. Eliot Spitzer's choice as the new chairman of the Long Island Power Authority, is making no pledges that Long Island electric rates, now among the nation's highest, will drop more than modestly anytime soon.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Law said in a recent interview that there is a way to deal with customers' high bills. Singling out energy conservation as one of his highest priorities, he said the authority could and should do more to entice its 1.1 million customers to cut bills by consuming less power, particularly during times of peak demand.</p>
        <p>''We have got to move the focus off the rates because a lot of things to do with the rates we can't control,'' Mr. Law said, citing the price of Middle East oil and the debt for the Shoreham nuclear power plant, which never became operational. ''What we need to focus on are the bills that people are paying and how we can reduce them.''</p>
        <p>Among steps that could be taken, he said, would be charging less for electricity used during off-peak hours, including nighttime.</p>
        <p>''We need to start being smarter with the way we consume energy, and that will have a tremendous impact on our bills,'' Mr. Law said.</p>
        <p>Conservation, which the authority has already made a focus of a 10-year, $351 million program, would have to buck a trend of increasing electricity demand. The average customer used 21 percent more electricity in 2005 than in 1998, authority figures show. LIPA set a one-day demand record, 5,792 megawatts, on Aug. 3.</p>
        <p>With customers paying about 40 percent more for electricity than they did five years ago, in large part because of higher oil prices, the incentive to cut use may now be stronger. As head of the authority, which has a $3.6 billion annual budget, Mr. Law will be in a position to increase spending on incentive programs.</p>
        <p>Gordian Raacke, the executive director of the nonprofit group Renewable Energy Long Island, estimated that conservation and energy-efficiency programs could save 500 megawatts of electric capacity. ''It's a big untapped potential, and Kevin is right in what he's saying,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Law, 46, a lawyer from St. James, was a Suffolk deputy county executive and the top manager for County Executive Steve Levy for three years before Governor Spitzer named him in January to replace Richard M. Kessel as authority chairman, an unpaid position. He will become the full-time, salaried chief executive and president by next fall, when Mr. Kessel, who now holds those titles, departs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Law will play an important role in a variety of energy issues.</p>
        <p>He said he would ''insert myself right into the middle'' of the authority's talks with KeySpan Energy, LIPA's primary power provider, and the British-owned National Grid over their planned merger. A New York Public Service Commission staff report last month said the $12 billion buyout of KeySpan, which manages LIPA's electric transmission and distribution system, would lead to higher rates and a loss of local autonomy. A commission ruling on the merger is expected later this year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Law said he would consult with Mr. Spitzer on Broadwater Energy's proposal for a floating plant in Long Island Sound that would deliver a billion cubic feet of natural gas daily to the metropolitan area. But he suggested that as the governor's appointee, he would support Mr. Spitzer's decision on whether the project is in accord with the state's coastal zone management plan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy strongly opposes the Broadwater plant as unnecessary, a safety and security risk, and an industrializing and privatizing of the Sound. Despite his role in Mr. Levy's administration, Mr. Law said he had never taken a public position on the project. ''I'm not sure I am going to have to,'' he said, though he added that he had concerns about Broadwater that he would express to Mr. Spitzer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Law said his other priorities included reviewing authority salaries, contracts and costs; examining opportunities for repowering, or retrofitting, one or more of Long Island's major energy plants to increase capacity while cutting emissions; and revisiting whether the authority should support the 250-megawatt gas-powered generator that KeySpan holds permits to build on Spagnoli Road in Melville.</p>
        <p>THOUGH he said he supported solar and wind projects and accepted scientific evidence that fossil fuel emissions were causing global warming, Mr. Law has not embraced a $400 million project for 40 wind turbines off the South Shore. Mr. Kessel and environmental groups strongly back the project.</p>
        <p>In optimum conditions, LIPA says, the turbines would provide up to 140 megawatts of power. But, by industry estimates, average output would be less than half that -- particularly during the summer, when offshore winds are lightest.</p>
        <p>''It sounds like a really neat project, but we need to make sure it is an affordable one,'' Mr. Law said. ''We need to explore it, but maybe the technology needs to get better.''</p>
        <p>A decision to back away from the wind project would be highly unpopular with environmental groups.</p>
        <p>''We need to understand that saving the planet is not going to be cheap or convenient,'' said Adrienne Esposito, the executive director of Citizens Campaign for the Environment. ''But it's still worth doing.''</p>
        <p>Matthew C. Cordaro, the director of the Center for Management Analysis at the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University, said there were better alternatives, including the repowering of existing plants. ''The wind project is very expensive, and you get very little power,'' said Mr. Cordaro, a former utility executive. He estimated the cost at $500 million and average output at 40 megawatts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Law said that repowering would also be expensive, citing estimates that repowering just one of the four units at KeySpan's Northport plant, one of Long Island's largest emitters of greenhouse gases, would cost $250 million.</p>
