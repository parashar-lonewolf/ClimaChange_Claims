        <p>Ten of the 15 European Union nations are falling behind in efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions and meet targets set by the Kyoto Protocol, the international agreement to combat climate change.</p>
        <p>A report prepared by the European Environment Agency shows that the union's greenhouse gas emissions, which are often cited as a cause for global warming, have risen for the second year running, with Ireland, Spain and Portugal the worst offenders. The union's largest economies, Germany and Britain, have cut such emissions by more than the agreed amount, while France just reached its goal.</p>
        <p>But Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Greece, Austria, Portugal, Finland, Ireland and Denmark are all falling short of the targets.</p>
        <p>Margot Wallstrom, the union's environment commissioner, said today: ''The European Union is moving further away from meeting its commitment to achieve a substantial emissions cut under the Kyoto Protocol. The progress we have made already needs to be backed up by additional measures. The member states that are not on track in reaching their targets urgently need to take additional action.''</p>
        <p>As a group, the union is supposed to reduce emissions of six gases compared with levels in 1990. Several nations -- especially those with less mature economies, like Spain, Greece, Portugal and Ireland -- are only supposed to hold increased emissions to a set level.</p>
        <p>But all four have exceeded targets, with annual emissions in Spain rising by 32.1 percent instead of 15 percent, and in Ireland by 31.1 percent rather than 13 percent.</p>
        <p>The commission did note that ''for the first time in five years, Spain's emissions decreased by 1 percent compared with its figures for 2000. This was the result of a greater production of hydropower, which reduced the need to burn fossil fuels for power and heat.''</p>
        <p>Spain and Ireland denied that they lacked the political will to make the necessary changes.</p>
        <p>''We are finally on a downward trend and we will maintain that and reach our target,'' said an official at the Spanish Ministry of the Environment.</p>
        <p>''We began at a level far below the other countries and have experienced tremendous economic growth,'' the official said, ''and it has been hard for us to harness all the new technology. But Spain has always said we must fulfill the Kyoto Protocol, because we think it will benefit the global environment.''</p>
        <p>Spain now has the fifth largest economy in Europe, and in 2001 it produced 382.8 million tons of greenhouse gases, compared with 70 million tons in Ireland, another country transformed by economic growth in the 1990's.</p>
        <p>''Ireland has always expected that without action our emissions would rise and that our target would be challenging to meet,'' a statement from the Irish Environment Department said. ''This is why the government published the National Climate Change Strategy in November 2000, and full implementation of the strategy has the capacity to ensure Ireland meets its target by the end of this decade.''</p>
        <p>Germany's emissions also rose 1 percent between 2000 and 2001, but the country, the union's biggest polluter, has cut gas emissions by 44 percent since 1990, partly through the revamping of polluting industries in the former East Germany.</p>
        <p>Britain has also cut emissions beyond the Kyoto targets, in part because of the switching from coal-fired to gas-fired power stations.</p>
        <p>Tony Carritt, spokesman for the European Environment Agency, which prepared the annual report, said the figures did not mean that the union would fail to comply with the Kyoto Protocol, but he said, ''It's a warning sign that things are not going as well as they should.''</p>
        <p>The union over all will almost certainly comply with the treaty, but some of the member states ''are going to have quite a tough time getting back on track.''</p>
        <p>Mark Kenber of the climate change program of the World Wildlife Federation, said he had no doubt that the union would meet its Kyoto obligations, if only by buying emissions credits from other nations. The question, he said, is whether the union is doing enough to actually slow climate change.</p>
        <p>The report, he said, ''is not good, because it shows that many European countries are not doing what they need to do to bring their emissions down.''</p>
        <p>''Industry is not seeking out all the energy efficiency potential: you can actually make money out of reducing your emissions.''</p>
        <p>But he noted that several important measures under the European Climate Change Program would come into force this year and that they could help members cut emissions relatively cheaply.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kenber said that while Spain was the fastest-growing producer of wind power in Europe, its industries were relatively inefficient energy users. He said government help was vital to promoting cleaner energy.</p>
        <p>''It is very difficult for individual companies to make fuel switches on their own,'' he said. ''They need governments to legislate. For instance, when switching from coal to wind power the initial investment is very high, but in the long term it is very profitable.''</p>
