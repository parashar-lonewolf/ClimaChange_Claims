        <p>A WHINE in the air. A sudden silence. That unmistakable stinging moment.</p>
        <p>That sequence has not changed, scientists say, for more than 100 million years, since the early descendants of the tropical Ur-mosquito  were buzzing the Cretaceous era, enjoying a bit of Tyrannosaur tartare.</p>
        <p>This year, across New Jersey, the stinging, slapping and complaining have been gaining momentum. The El Nino-induced early spring gave the breeding season a jump-start, and the season was repeatedly drenched in mosquito-friendly rains. Whether the plague will continue is largely a matter of day-to-day weather conditions (occasional heavy rain promotes mosquitoes), but the counteroffensive has mobilized.</p>
        <p>The Hudson County Executive, Robert C. Janiszewski, just declared ''Gulf War'' on mosquitoes. Raymond J. Keyes is driving a pickup as long as 10 hours a night on Essex County's byways, fogging swamps and backyards with toxic clouds. Lynn Hayward lifts off regularly in his 1984 bubble helicopter to spray Cape May County's salt marshes with killer chemicals. But the theory and methods of mosquito control are all different from the old days, and far more environmentally sensitive. It's a surprising twist for a field whose image, if it exists in the public imagination at all, is that of a huge, governmentally wielded can of Raid.</p>
        <p>The new approaches were largely pioneered in New Jersey, which is where the old approaches came from, too. The first state to write mosquito control into law, shortly after the turn of the century, New Jersey boasts a roster of legendary ''mosquito men'' who created the control techniques that have come to define the field. The American Mosquito Control Association, now international, was founded in New Jersey in 1935. The association is sponsoring the second annual Mosquito Awareness Week, which starts tomorrow. Events include a daylong public education extravaganza at Liberty State Park, on Tuesday, in which citizens will be entertained with bug-themed games and reminded that even a forgotten bottle cap that fills with standing water can breed mosquitoes.</p>
        <p>''New Jersey is really a nexus of mosquito control,'' said Dominick Ninivaggi, who heads a mosquito control agency in New York State. Mr. Ninivaggi has joined New Jersey's Mosquito Control Association in order to stay abreast of the cutting edge.</p>
        <p>Prevention is the first order of business, for counties that can afford it and recognize its importance, and it takes the form of year-round wetlands management so environmentally friendly that county mosquito agencies often have framed conservation awards on their walls. Larvae-eating fish are grown in a state hatchery and carefully distributed to some problematic freshwater areas. For spraying, expensive bio rational agents -- substances that interfere with the life cycle of the mosquito, but with virtually nothing else -- are the weapons of choice. Chemical larvicides and the bluntly named adulticide compounds tend to be short-lived and highly specific, but they are nonetheless considered a last resort.</p>
        <p>''We've all been educated in the environmental era,'' observed Robert Kent, the principal biologist for the state's mosquito control office, which is -- physically, bureaucratically and philosophically -- in the Department of Environmental Protection and Energy.</p>
        <p>The New Jersey Environmental Federation, the state's largest organized environmental group, is the closest thing to a real opponent the mosquito agencies have. That group retains a very dim view of mosquito control, believing the agencies overstate the risk of disease to justify their own existence and use more pesticides than necessary.</p>
        <p>''The guys at the mosquito commission are like mosquito cowboys!'' said Jane Nogaki, the pesticide program coordinator for the group. ''They just love to spray.''</p>
        <p>But she said lawn care accounts for far more pesticide use than mosquito control. Of the four million, she said, are used on lawns. Agriculture accounts for 1.6 million pounds. Mosquito control, the group estimates, accounts for about 63,000 pounds -- about 1.5 percent of the state's total.</p>
        <p>''The stereotype of mosquito control is somebody out with a fogger or a bottle of pesticide,'' said Chris Novak, the executive director of the Terrine Institute, a nonprofit wetlands-protection organization based in Washington. ''But a balanced wetlands habitat is the most effective control.''</p>
        <p>New Jersey owes its primacy in mosquito control to a bounty of raw material in the form of 63 species of mosquitoes, a number exceeded in the United States only by Florida's 65. Not all mosquitoes bite humans. In fact, they live on a diet of nectar. They pollinate flowers. In an adaptation that is usually mentioned to the accompaniment of bitter male laughter, only the females need blood. They use the protein for their eggs.</p>
        <p>Researchers who identify species get to name them, which, it turns out, is a rare opportunity to exercise their senses of humor. Among New Jersey's resident species are 28 in the genus Aedes, including excrucians, grossbecki, intrudens, provocans, sticticus and vexans. There is one in the genus Coquillettidia: perturbans.</p>
        <p>A regular nominee for the state's most irritating mosquito is Aedes sollicitans, the New Jersey salt-marsh mosquito (acidly known in some quarters as the state bird), which is also widely believed to be a carrier of eastern equine encephalitis. The encephalitis is usually only a problem during long, hot summers in which the disease overruns birds, its host population, and begins spreading to horses and humans.</p>
        <p>And the state has a malaria carrier. Malaria, caused by a protozoan that mosquitoes ingest with blood and then inject into victims as part of their blood-thinning saliva, was considered eradicated in the state in the 1950's. The 60 or 70 cases reported here annually were invariably established as having been contracted in other countries -- except in 1991, when two locally acquired cases startled health officials.</p>
        <p>One was in Sicklerville, in Camden County, and one in Manalapan, in Monmouth County. Dr. John H. Brook, a senior official with the state Department of Health and Senior Services, said someone probably entered the country with malaria, it went untreated, and was bitten by local Anopheles quadrimaculatus. (The complex demands of the transfer process insures that H.I.V. cannot be spread by mosquito bite.)</p>
        <p>There is even a sort of killer bee of mosquitoes in the state: Aedes albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito. An aggressive daytime biter that breeds easily in urban settings, it has been spreading through the United States since its arrival from Asia in a boatload of used tires in 1985. Identified in 1995 in Monmouth County, the mosquito seems to have paused in its expansion. But Mr. Kent expects a cold-tolerant variety to evolve soon, and continue the spread north.</p>
        <p>A 'Mosquito Man' Who Started It All</p>
        <p>But there is a second, human, reason the state stands so tall in mosquito circles: John Bernhard Smith. In 1889, Smith, a colorful lawyer and self-taught bug lover, was named entomologist for the Federally established Agricultural Experiment Station at Rutgers. And he became convinced that mosquitoes, known to carry malaria -- which killed hundreds of people in the state annually -- could be controlled.</p>
        <p>One of Smith's greatest admirers is Dr. Wayne Crans, the current entomologist at the Experiment Station. A calm, bearded man with a glowing national reputation, Dr. Crans keeps on his office wall a framed photograph of Smith and his microscope in the lab. Next to it, in a glass case, is the  actual microscope. On another wall is a period newspaper cartoon that shows Uncle Sam knee-deep in the Panama canal, swatting at mosquitoes and yelling ''Tell Jersey we need her Mosquito Man Smith!''</p>
        <p>''John B. Smith is not an exciting name,'' Dr. Crans said, ''but he was quite an exciting guy.''</p>
        <p>Smith identified the state's worst biters, and focused on the biology of each in the quest for a vulnerable phase, Dr. Crans said. He showed they could fly miles from their hatching points, proving that mosquito control had to be a regional, not a municipal, concern. And he discovered that mosquitoes needed water to breed.</p>
        <p>Smith was laughed out of the state Legislature when he first suggested that draining swamps and pouring oil on standing water might kill the pests that spread malaria, but if he'd let that stop him, he'd never have earned the moniker Dr. Crans proudly repeated: the Father of Mosquito Control. He persuaded some municipalities to try his methods. And when the legislators were convinced by the results, they let him write  mandatory mosquito control into state law. To this day, the Agricultural Experiment Station is the official advising agent for mosquito units.</p>
        <p>Smith died just days before his legislation was signed into law, but his mark was made. Hopefully titled ''extermination'' commissions, autonomous control agencies were rapidly created in every county but Hunterdon, where there are mosquitoes but not so many people to complain about them. They operate with broad authority; some even have the power to alter development plans.</p>
        <p>Smith's research was groundbreaking, but the early control methods were environmentally brutal. Workers sprayed heavy oil on the surface of freshwater ponds to kill larvae. They dug grids of thousands of miles of ditches to drain the saltwater and freshwater wetlands of coastal, upland and northern New Jersey, meaning to remove the mosquitoes' breeding habitat. They did, but they also changed entire ecosystems, killing native spartina grasses and encouraging the intruder weed phragmites (a notable example is the Meadowlands).</p>
        <p>The newer methods, called open marsh water management, are evident in Cape May County, which has approximately 53,000 acres of salt marsh, about 20,000 of which were long-standing breeding grounds for Aedes sollicitans. This mosquito lays its eggs on the inland edges of the salt marsh, where they will be touched only by the high twice-monthly lunar tides. Once soaked, the eggs can hatch, and biting will begin about a week later.</p>
        <p>The Cape May Mosquito Commission has identified exactly which areas mosquitoes breed in. In many places, workers have removed dikes from abandoned salt-hay farms, encouraging daily tidal flow. They have dug inlets, so that naturally occurring larva-hungry fish can penetrate breeding areas and ponds, so the fish can stay in mosquito-friendly spots even when water levels are low.</p>
        <p>''Over the last 20 years, we've reduced our breeding marshes by about 12,000 acres,'' said Judy Hansen, head of the commission. ''Those acres require no pesticides.'' However, chemical treatment is common on the remaining 8,000 acres.</p>
        <p>Nonchemical procedures work in freshwater wetlands too. Meandering ditches can reduce sheetwater, where larvae flourish. But the ditches can be designed not to dry the areas out, leaving the habitat friendly to birds and other creatures. And standing water can be deepened into ponds and stocked with the guppy-sized mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis, a larvae vacuum cleaner.</p>
        <p>Since 1990, the state's warm-water hatchery in Hackettstown, in Warren County, has been raising Gambusia for that reason. The hatchery is a turn-of-the-century 200-acre wildlife magnet whose main purpose is to raise tiger muskie, catfish and four kinds of bass, used to stock lakes and rivers for the benefit of recreational fishers, who pay for it all with their licenses. The mosquitofish has also proven useful in stormwater basins and in those early drainage ditches meant to control mosquitoes, which, left untended, can fill and become new breeding areas.</p>
        <p>Short-Lived Chemicals Have Replaced DDT</p>
        <p>If the first orders of the new-fangled mosquito business are interrupting breeding habitats and re-establishing effective predators, the next is using chemical means to damage or kill larvae. The very last, and the least effective, all agree, is poisoning the full-fledged biters, known bluntly in the trade as adulticide.</p>
        <p>But when budgets are cut back, the preventive measures are often the first to go. Connecticut tried dismantling its mosquito control a few years ago, just in time to get overrun with the wettest, most mosquito-ridden summer in memory. It rapidly reinstated its control agency. New Hampshire's mosquito control lies entirely in the private sector.</p>
        <p>And New Jersey is not immune to cutbacks. Twelve counties have turned their commissions into divisions of their departments of public health, public works, parks and recreation, or engineering and planning. Eight counties -- Camden, Cape May, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean, Salem and Warren -- still have full-fledged independent commissions that control budgets ranging from a high of $1.7 million (Morris) to a low of $250,000 (Salem). Some commissions, like Monmouth County's, are adding Lyme disease control to their purview to keep the funding flowing. The state office, with a budget of just under $500,000, offers advice and technical support to all 20 of the county agencies, whose 1997 budgets totaled more than $13 million.</p>
        <p>But even when prevention is abandoned, or fails, and chemicals are called upon, environmentally sensitive methods are at the fore. It's not that pesticides are no longer used, though DDT, a chlorinated hydrocarbon that poisoned entire food chains, has long been retired. There are still some, the organophosphates, like malathion and temephos. that worry environmentalists.</p>
        <p>Newer pesticides, developed commercially over the last few years, are highly specific and extremely short-lived. Some are preparations of bacteria that attack only larvae of a certain age. For instance, the Hudson County's Executive's ''Gulf War'' uses B.T.I. (Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis), which, when ingested by a larva, destroys its stomach.</p>
        <p>Other pesticides mimic the mosquito's growth hormone, preventing larvae from emerging as adults, but leaving them alive and well as fish food. Delivery systems are biodegradable -- fragmented corn husks or paper pellets. Fogging machines are ultra-low volume, dispersing less than two ounces of pesticide per acre. (Driving his fogging truck the other night, Mr. Keyes, the superintendent of the Essex County mosquito unit, confessed that he is so conservative about chemicals that he never uses repellent on himself. ''You get all concerned about this,'' he said, referring to people who complain about his truck, ''but you've got DEET all over your skin!'')</p>
        <p>Careful, thorough monitoring means that chemicals are used only when problems are documented. Inspectors drive around, sampling water for larvae and checking traps for adults. They count the take and divide up the species in the lab. And they take ''landing counts,'' in which an inspector stands still for one minute and counts how many mosquitoes land on him or her.</p>
        <p>''That's my favorite thing,'' Mr. Keyes said, with a guffaw that meant it isn't. If he counts enough skeeters, the truck rolls out.</p>
        <p>''Twenty,'' he said. ''Twenty's always been my magic number.''</p>
        <p>What Repels Mosquitoes, What Doesn't</p>
        <p>Only female mosquitoes bite, and only because they need a meal of blood to acquire the protein necessary to lay their eggs. These critters find their quarry by detecting the carbon dioxide from the animals' breath, as well as lactic acid and other, less studied byproducts of metabolism.</p>
        <p>Scientists have confirmed that some people are much more attractive to mosquitoes than others:  Sweaty people are more appealing than nonsweaters, adults more than children, men more than women, and larger people more than smaller.</p>
        <p>But the scientists don't know why this is so; if they did, they might have devised a truly effective mosquito repellent. Meanwhile, we're stuck with repellent wannabes and impostors, and some that actually are slightly more noxious to mosquitoes than they are to humans. Here, according to, ''Mosquitoes and Mosquito Repellents: A Clinician's Guide,'' an article by Mark S. Fradin that appeared in  the June 1 edition of Annals of Internal Medicine are some of the more commonly used repellants and their relative effectiveness.</p>
        <p>Some plants supposedly repel mosquitoes, but the best known, the Citrosa, a genetically engineered hybrid  of lemon grass and geraniums, has been shown to be ineffective. So have bug zappers, which electrocute other varieties of insects but not mosquitoes, and novelty electronic devices that emit high-frequency sound waves.</p>
        <p>That leaves topical repellents, which work by evaporating at the skin surface, creating a ''fog'' that wards off the insect. The most common is DEET (N,N,-diethyl-3-mehylbenzamide) -- the active ingredient in commercial sprays like Off -- which was patented by the United States Army in 1946. The chemical can be toxic, particularly to children. Products with 10 percent to 35 percent concentrations of the chemical are considered adequate under normal conditions. High temperatures and sunscreen reduce its effectiveness.</p>
        <p>Citronella, the oil of a grass, can be an effective but short-lived repellent, requiring frequent reapplication. It is the most common active ingredient in repellents marketed as ''natural,'' like Buzz Away (5 percent), Herbal Armor (15 percent) and Green Ban for People (5 and 10 percent).</p>
        <p>Several years ago, Avon Skin-So-Soft, a bath oil reputed to function as a repellent, was tested in laboratory conditions and found to provide 30 to 40 minutes' worth of protection against at least two mosquito species. (And there's the rub: Mosquito species are many and mobile, so you have no way of knowing which types are in your yard.) Avon has since added trace amounts of citronella oil to its Skin-So-Soft products.</p>
        <p>A plant-based repellent that is new to the United States, Bite Blocker, combines soybean oil with geranium and coconut oil. Canadian studies show that it gave nearly 100 percent protection from some mosquito species for more than three hours.</p>
        <p>A final category of repellent is a contact insecticide. Permethrin, a synthetic form of an African chrysanthemum, is the active ingredient in lice treatments as well as in aerial sprays that kill adult mosquitoes. It is applied to clothing and gear, like tents and sleeping bags, rather than to skin.</p>
        <p>ANDREA KANNAPELL</p>
        <p>SKEETER EATERS: FACT AND FICTION</p>
        <p>Some predators of mosquitoes get little credit and some get way too much. Dr. Wayne Crans, chief entomologist of the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station, sets the record straight.</p>
        <p>GAMBUSIA AFFINIS -- This inchlong freshwater fish eats hundreds of larvae an hour. It bears live young -- 120 to 400 a year -- and so requires no special environment to spawn. And unlike most fish, it tolerates warm, shallow standing water, making it ideal for adding to stormwater basins, ditches and freshwater marshes.</p>
        <p>KILLIFISH -- Like Gambusia, these fish eat mosquito larvae, but are generally less tolerant of fetid water.</p>
        <p>BATS -- Mosquitoes make up a very small percentage of insectivorous bats' natural diets. Research that suggested otherwise was based on 1950's echo-location studies, in which bats were released in rooms full of nothing but mosquitoes. Those bats ate up to 10 mosquitoes a minute. That finding has been extrapolated to suggest that an average-sized colony of 500 bats would remove at least a quarter million mosquitoes an hour. In fact, bats usually vastly prefer moths, beetles and other non-pest insects.</p>
        <p>PURPLE MARTINS -- There is a bit of utterly false popular wisdom that says this bird can eat 2,000 to 14,000 mosquitoes a day. But that is based on the calculation of the number of insects it would take to maintain the purple martin's body weight. In fact, purple martins will eat a few mosquitoes, but they prefer dragonflies and other insects. And dragonflies eat mosquitoes.</p>
        <p>DRAGONFLIES -- Immature dragonflies stand at the edge of ponds and pounce on mosquito larvae. Mature dragonflies fly ''patrols'' over ponds, catching mosquitoes in midair and eating them in flight. Dragonflies will even follow mosquito broods into fields.</p>
