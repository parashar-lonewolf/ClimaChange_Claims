        <p>MY STERN, BEAUTIFUL mother perfected "the Original-Sin School of Vegetable Cookery." Her favorite victim: the Brussels sprout. Born Presbyterian, she was not alone in boiling first, asking later. God also overcooks. (See global warming.) Mom was first on our street to serve separate salads, with separate forks. But when it came to the scourging of farm tubers, she proved to be just one more Clorox country-club lady of stringent 1953. Her face probably still appears on the walls of certain vegetable post offices.</p>
        <p>The "Original-Sin School" (sometimes called the "Salem Witch School") assumes this much theology: "All vegetables, like human souls, are assumed guilty till proven guilty." Being congenital dirt dwellers, root-foods appear far too Fiesta Ware colorful. No Protestant discipline whatever. Texture itself  remains the enemy within. Such brilliant phallic seed-pods sure need heaps of hygienic purgation: 10 to 40 minutes at full boil.</p>

        <p>MY STERN, BEAUTIFUL mother perfected "the Original-Sin School of Vegetable Cookery." Her favorite victim: the Brussels sprout. Born Presbyterian, she was not alone in boiling first, asking later. God also overcooks. (See global warming.) Mom was first on our street to serve separate salads, with separate forks. But when it came to the scourging of farm tubers, she proved to be just one more Clorox country-club lady of stringent 1953. Her face probably still appears on the walls of certain vegetable post offices.</p>
        <p>The "Original-Sin School" (sometimes called the "Salem Witch School") assumes this much theology: "All vegetables, like human souls, are assumed guilty till proven guilty." Being congenital dirt dwellers, root-foods appear far too Fiesta Ware colorful. No Protestant discipline whatever. Texture itself  remains the enemy within. Such brilliant phallic seed-pods sure need heaps of hygienic purgation: 10 to 40 minutes at full boil.</p>
        <p>First ingredient for purging fugitive vitamin life from your self-confessed ground tubers: a pot of really boiling water. And not just bubbles -- roaring white. Preferably in Revereware with its lid absolutely clanking. On the nearest cold marbleized Formica, line up the accused -- knob veggies awaiting their appointment with eternity. Plop each in. Cook till they've become a safe, bright, uniform paste, till just before they shatter into tweed. "Overcooked?" That's like saying "overclean" or "overchurched."</p>
        <p>Brimstoned throughout on first contact, these crisp morsels first turned mushy, then ceramically resentful. They soon became toxic platelets, tinny Nixonian martyrs. Sure, they tasted bitter; you would, too, if my mom tried boiling you every Tuesday and Thursday. Sprouts turned iron gray, and soon tasted like Self Pity's own flinty saliva. Next, like the first ash inhaled at Pompeii; finally like those filmy lenses over swamp-dwelling alligators' eyes. When buds' interior crenulations grew kiln-fused into one indigestible resinous  clove hitch . . . nearly done! I spent many childhood evenings left "at table,"  staring down a former-floral burn victim -- one I could not, would not eat. Ice  cold, Brussels sprouts taste even worse. The family dog refused to help me, even after I'd coated the thing in Adolph's Meat Tenderizer. So I slid it beneath a kitchen radiator, then bolted from the table and -- next morning -- woke to a house that reeked like the boiled urine of an asparagus-eating dinosaur. Guess what my breakfast was?</p>
        <p>I date my sophisticated adulthood from last week, the moment I -- by accident, not knowing what hid within light beer batter -- ate one lightly steamed. I asked my friend, "What's this wonderful, nutlike, endivey, aristocratic sort of taste?" She said, "That is the Brussels sprout." My right hand grabbed my throat. But, being mature, game, fully Christian if no longer glass-eatingly Calvinist, I kept . . . chewing. Pistachio-y if served al dente-ish, somewhere on the kale continuum. Who'd have guessed?</p>
        <p>Now I am a man. Now I barely steam. And I envision hell (if that be my fate)  as maybe some pleasant sauna colander in Arizona, one that upgrades our base-coat khaki-green to a hue as rich as emeralds. May hell -- please God -- also honor our original texture, one that some prigs still call original sin. At least they judge starter-kit sin to be somewhat original. That very stubborn  graining is what I call a soul. And the most unlovable sprout at least starts out with one.</p>
