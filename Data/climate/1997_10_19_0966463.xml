        <p>Framed by the ancient Patagonian wilderness, President Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina appeared with President Clinton here today to endorse Mr. Clinton's call for developing nations to join developed ones in restricting gases that contribute to global warming.</p>
        <p>Under pressure at home and abroad to address global warming, Mr. Clinton is seeking to negotiate binding limits on emissions for all countries, including developing ones. Many of those countries say industrialized countries that have benefited most from polluting should bear the costs of addressing it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Menem declared ''we agree with the United States when you say that a global problem such as climate change requires a global answer, coming from all countries.''</p>
        <p>But he also made clear that he expected the United States, the world's leader in emitting greenhouse gases, to bear the greatest burdens. Unless the United States takes on ''the greatest of responsibilities,'' he said, ''any achievement arrived at will be of short duration or not deep enough.''</p>
        <p>After rarely addressing the issue in his first term, Mr. Clinton began to sound an alarm over the summer that climate change could cause flooding, drought and outbreaks of disease. He is preparing for a December conference in Japan at which more than 150 nations plan to negotiate over reducing greenhouse gases. Talks to prepare for that meeting are to begin in Germany on Monday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton is seeking what he calls ''realistic and binding'' limits for greenhouse gas emissions by all nations. But he has not completed his proposal on limits, and it is far from clear what mechanism he would want -- or what Mr. Menem, or any other leader, might accept -- to enforce such restrictions. Mr. Clinton plans to announce his emissions proposal later this week.</p>
        <p>During the announcement by the two Presidents today in this remote and stunning park, pollution seemed a distant problem. As they stood on a hillside here, a blue wrinkled lake stretched away behind them and all around stood iron-gray Andean crags, joined by razorback ridges and surmounted by snow.</p>
        <p>The two countries agreed to enact ''joint implementation,'' under which a company in one of the countries can receive credits for reducing emissions by helping a company in the other to cut greenhouse gases. The program is intended to speed the spread of effective environmental technologies to developing countries.</p>
        <p>In his remarks today, Mr. Clinton acknowledged that industrialized countries produce most greenhouse gases, although industrial groups and some scientists argue that uncertainty about the climate justifies the delaying action on . ''But emissions from the developing world are expected to grow dramatically,'' he said. ''Forty years from now, they will exceed those of developed countries.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's aides said that they regard Argentina as a developing nation. But because it is one of the most industrialized Latin American countries, with a high per-capita income, the aides said Argentina was particularly attractive as a partner in emissions control.</p>
        <p>''These are precisely the guys we need to get,'' said one senior White House aide. ''We don't need the desperately poor countries.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton planned to fly home overnight tonight after his weeklong Latin American trip, devoted primarily to promoting his goals for free trade in the hemisphere. He has also spoken regularly about global warming. Brazil and Venezuela, the other countries he visited, have not yet agreed to a declaration like the one issued here today.</p>
        <p>Jim Steinberg, Mr. Clinton's deputy national security adviser, praised Argentina's move as a ''concrete commitment to the idea there should be emissions limits.''</p>
        <p>He acknowledged that no mechanism was spelled out for enforcing any limits but said ''it would not be meaningful, in our view, unless there were some assurances'' that the limits would be met.</p>
        <p>Industrial groups and some scientists argue that uncertainty about the climate justifies delaying action on such limits.</p>
        <p>Five years ago, at an environmental summit in Rio de Janeiro, the United States and other industrialized nations agreed to reduce their emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. But most now acknowledge that they will not achieve that goal, and the United States is projected to be 13 percent above it.</p>
        <p>To the dismay of environmentalists, some of Mr. Clinton's economic and environmental aides have urged him to delay until the year 2010 or beyond any deep reductions in pollution. By contrast, European nations, who would have an easier time restricting their emissions, have proposed reductions of 15 percent below 1990 levels by 2010.</p>
