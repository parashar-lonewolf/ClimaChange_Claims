        <p>Unseasonably warm weather has resorts like Font-Romeu in the French Pyrenees, above, making snow. But it also has skiers discussing more important issues.

        <p>Now Patrick Thorne, a journalist who writes about skiing, has started www.SaveOurSnow.com, which is devoted entirely to eco-friendly skiing.

        <p>Unseasonably warm weather has resorts like Font-Romeu in the French Pyrenees, above, making snow. But it also has skiers discussing more important issues.

        <p>Now Patrick Thorne, a journalist who writes about skiing, has started www.SaveOurSnow.com, which is devoted entirely to eco-friendly skiing. While downhill skiing is hardly healthy for the environment -- forests are leveled to make pistes, water is drained to make snow and energy is wasted on chairlifts -- Mr. Thorne said he believed the global ski industry could work together for climate change.</p>
        <p>''At the moment, the projections of catastrophe for the ski industry, and ultimately the planet, are the same around the world,'' Mr. Thorne said. ''The ski industry represents the tip of the iceberg for global warming and could be an example for us all.''</p>
        <p>Most useful is the site's database, which ranks the ''greenness'' of more than 200 ski resorts. Each resort is given a rating of one to five stars based on their policies on climate change, sewage, traffic and waste reduction, as well as development.</p>
        <p>A quick check showed Whistler, in British Columbia, with four stars; Vail, Colo., three; and Killington, Vt., two. All seven resorts with five stars are in Europe.</p>
