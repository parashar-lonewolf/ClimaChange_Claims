        <p>Fisons P.L.C. surrendered yesterday to a hostile takeover bid by Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the big French-American drug company. Fisons advised its shareholders to accept Rhone-Poulenc Rorer's latest offer of $2.89 billion.</p>
        <p>Rhone-Poulenc Rorer said the deal would strengthen its position in the highly profitable global market for asthma and allergy treatments, which has sales of $9 billion a year.</p>
        <p>Fisons, a medium-sized British company, was unable to find a higher bidder, but Rhone-Poulenc Rorer did sweeten its Aug. 18 offer of $2.6 billion, adding $290 million. The Fisons sales last year were $1.9 billion.</p>
        <p>Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, which is 68 percent owned by the French chemical company Rhone-Poulenc, has about 10 percent of its $4.5 billion annual sales in asthma and allergy products. Fisons, which makes the asthma inhalers Intal and Tilade, has about $520 million in worldwide respiratory therapy sales, analysts said.</p>
        <p>Intal sales have dropped with the expiration of patent protection, but Fisons is developing new types of asthma treatment devices that Rhone-Poulenc Rorer can adapt for its own products, said Nigel Barnes, an analyst with Merrill Lynch in London. The companies are scrambling to find substitutes for inhalers that use chloroflurocarbon propellants, which are being phased out under international agreements to protect the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>Samuel D. Isaly of Mehta &amp; Isaly Worldwide Healthcare Investments, a research firm, said Rhone-Poulenc Rorer's costs would be reduced because Fisons would have net cash of $800 million after the recent sales of its scientific equipment and laboratory supplies units and its research and development pipeline, which it sold to Astra A.B. of Sweden.</p>
        <p>Mr. Isaly said the British company's gross profit margins were "at least 75 percent, possibly 80 percent." He said Rhone-Poulenc Rorer's gross margins were 65 percent. There are relatively few companies making asthma treatments, and it is difficult for outsiders to jump in with new products.</p>
        <p>Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, which is based in Collegeville, Pa., has been concentrating on respiratory and cardiovascular therapies and cancer drugs, Guy Esnouf, a company spokesman, said. The company recently sold the North American marketing rights to its nonprescription drug line, headed by Maalox, to Ciba-Geigy Ltd.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barnes said Fisons, whose American headquarters are in Rochester, had been "dogged with problems" for five years. It withdrew some products from sale in the United States after the Food and Drug Administration raised concerns about manufacturing practices.</p>
        <p>The company has had three chief executives since 1992. Stuart Wallis, the current Fisons chief, tried unsuccessfully to acquire Medeva P.L.C., another British drug company, earlier this year. They could not agree on the price.</p>
        <p>Fisons sold its research pipeline after deciding that the company was not big enough to compete with pharmaceuticals giants like Merck &amp; Company and Glaxo Wellcome. Mr. Barnes said the stripped-down Fisons was "principally a marketing company."</p>
        <p>"The flaw," he added, "was that the products were not of sufficient quality to give it underlying earnings growth."</p>
        <p>Rhone-Poulenc Rorer offered yesterday to pay $:2.65 a share for Fisons. The offer, which ends on Oct. 20, is not being made in the United States, Canada, Australia or Japan.</p>
        <p>Rhone-Poulenc Rorer shares rose $1, to $45.375 yesterday, on the New York Stock Exchange. Fisons shares fell half a penny, to 263 pence, on the London Stock Exchange. The Fisons American depository receipts, which represent one share each, fell 12.5 cents, to $16.375, in Nasdaq trading.  INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS</p>
