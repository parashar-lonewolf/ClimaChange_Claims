        <p>9 P.M. (Hallmark) LOVE'S ABIDING JOY -- This fourth adaptation of Janette Oke's prairie novels finds Missie and Willie LeHaye (played by Erin Cottrell and Logan Bartholomew, left)and their three children at home on the range. But a tragedy puts their love and faith to the test. The series' first three installments, which chronicle two generations of settlers, come first, starting at 3 with ''Love Comes Softly,'' starring Katherine Heigl of ''Grey's Anatomy'' as a stranded widow who is forced to move in with a widower and his daughter, and followed at 5 by ''Love's Enduring Promise,'' in which a mysterious traveler arrives at their farm, and at 7 by ''Love's Long Journey,'' which follows the LeHayes to untamed territory.</p>
        <p>4 P.M. (NBC) MICHAEL BOLTON: TRIBUTE ON ICE -- Brian Boitano, Ilia Kulik, Brian Orser, Shizuka Arakawa, Yuka Sato, Shae-Lynn Bourne and others skate to music from Mr. Bolton and the evening's special guest, Wynonna. Also on hand, Mr. Bolton's fiancée, Nicollette Sheridan of ''Desperate Housewives.''</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Discovery) WHAT MAKES US HUMAN? -- It's one time when size apparently matters. In this two-part special, Dr. Arman Leroi, an evolutionary biologist, tries to prove his theory that when it comes to brains, bigger is in fact better.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (ABC Family) CHRISTMAS DO-OVER -- Jay Mohr plays a man in a rut. His marriage has disintegrated. His career is in the gutter. And then he starts reliving Christmas Day over and over again in this made-for-television holiday romance. But can repeating the same old mistakes help him open his eyes again? Daphne Zuniga (above, with Mr. Mohr) is the ex-wife who has moved on with her life. If only she could figure out what's missing.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (IFC) GREG THE BUNNY -- Last up in this season of puppet pranks, ''The Passion of the Easter Bunny: A Fabricated American Movie,'' in which Greg and his fuzzy pals do a hybrid spoof on Chris Smith's ''American Movie'' and Mel Gibson's ''Passion of the Christ.'' The real version of ''American Movie,'' about a young, determined filmmaker with no money, follows at 9:15.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (Cinemax) SYRIANA (2005). George Clooney, Matt Damon and Jeffrey Wright star in a series of parallel stories set in this epic, based on the book by Robert Baer, set in the greasy underbelly of the international oil business. Mr. Clooney (left) won an Oscar for best supporting actor as a C.I.A. agent for whom the war on terror becomes a little too personal.</p>
        <p>11 P.M. (Fox) MAD TV -- In this holiday special, Jeff Probst gets nutty in sketches like ''Songs From 'Survivor' '' and ''All-Star Christmas With Maury and Connie.'' Frosty the Snowman discusses global warming.</p>
        <p>11:30 P.M. (NBC) SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE -- Justin Timberlake does double duty as both host and musical guest.</p>
