        <p>LEAD: ''I am a man who sees life in terms of missions,'' Vice President Bush said as he accepted the Republican nomination for President in a speech that had two missions: to set himself apart from Ronald Reagan and to set himself apart from Michael Dukakis. He accomplished the first mission forthrightly.</p>
        <p>''I am a man who sees life in terms of missions,'' Vice President Bush said as he accepted the Republican nomination for President in a speech that had two missions: to set himself apart from Ronald Reagan and to set himself apart from Michael Dukakis. He accomplished the first mission forthrightly. His approach to the second involved some jarring distortion.</p>
        <p>Even so, the spirit was one of decency. Given recent expressions in a similar spirit from Governor Dukakis, the campaign, which only a few days ago seemed hopelessly surly, may be looking up.</p>
        <p>The wimp factor: That's shorthand for an impression that has bedeviled George Bush. It implies weakness, preppiness, noblesse oblige - an impression fortified by his tin ear for slang. What was most striking about his speech is how firmly he grasped the wimp epithet and turned it inside out.</p>
        <p>When he was trailing Bob Dole in New Hampshire last winter, Mr. Bush asked voters to accept him, warts and all; they did; he won. Thursday, he went so far as to specify some warts. ''I may sometimes be a little awkward . . . I am a quiet man -but I hear the quiet people others don't.'' Intimacy and modesty radiated from the TV screen.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush was equally bold in differing with the President. He promised to do more to fight pollution, especially acid rain. ''We need a new harmony among the races in our country,'' he said, and he called attention to influence-peddling in Washington as well as greed on Wall Street. It's hard to imagine his praise of honorable public servants coming from Mr. Reagan's lips. His concerns on behalf of, for instance, troubled children may strike some people as ''soft and insufficiently tough.'' Well, he said, ''I want a kinder, gentler nation.''</p>
        <p>He was less punctilious in distinguishing himself from Governor Dukakis. Playing to the lusty faithful is to be expected in convention speeches, but Mr. Bush pandered to them with a coarse litany on social issues like prayer in schools, guns in homes and reproductive rights.</p>
        <p>''Should public school teachers be required to lead our children in the pledge of allegiance? My opponent says no - and I say yes.'' Mr. Bush said that knowing perfectly well that he was distorting the record. The reason Governor Dukakis had vetoed a school pledge law was that Massachusetts' highest court said it was unconstitutional.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush created a larger distortion with an omission. Nowhere in his speech did he utter the word ''deficit.'' When Ronald Reagan accepted the nomination in 1980, he railed at Jimmy Carter for amassing a $60 billion deficit. Yet he has regularly rolled up deficits three times that amount. To judge by his acceptance speech, Mr. Bush's position is, What deficit?</p>
        <p>In tone, however, the Bush speech was decent, recalling something Michael Dukakis said a week ago. He had been asked about a Navy veteran's disputing George Bush's World War II heroism. Admirably, Mr. Dukakis said that such things have no place in the campaign; Mr. Bush has served this country well, and ''you don't fly 58 missions without enormous courage and tremendous patriotism.'' Mr. Bush hopes for a gentler country. For the moment, the new climate at least raises hopes for a sounder campaign.</p>
