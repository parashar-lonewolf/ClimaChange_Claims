        <p>LFL Gallery  530 West 24th Street, Chelsea  Through June 14</p>
        <p>More and more children of people who came of age in the 60's are entering the art world, and what they bring is something to ponder. Jules de Balincourt, who was born in 1970, makes art that with affectionate ambivalence reflects on the legacy of 60's-style radicalism.</p>
        <p>Mr. de Balincourt's handmade paintings and sculpture look like the efforts of a self-taught neo-hippie. The centerpiece is a tree-house (produced in collaboration with Andy Cross and Johnson Foster) big enough to hold 11 people and set in a life-size tree made by laminating wood, plywood, pegboard, blue foam insulation and other scavenged materials. It is a sly spoof of ''Whole Earth Catalogue''-style recycling and communalism.</p>
        <p>An expansive, grungy model of the artist's old Los Angeles neighborhood has a stream of real water running through it, which periodically floods the community. It's like an ambitious high school (or home-schooled) student's illustration of the effects of global warming.</p>
        <p>His rough but craft-influenced paintings are made by stenciling, layering, peeling and incising. They include ''Peaceful Protestors,'' in which naked people hold hands around a campfire; ''Media Information Transmission Center,'' a shed in the woods staffed by shirtless people broadcasting rainbow stripes from big dishes on the roof; and ''Neil Young,'' a panel bearing the rock demi-god's name in colorful script.</p>
        <p>Though not as funny, Mr. de Balincourt's work resembles that of Chris Johanson. Both artists project a rueful awareness of the generation gap in which they are caught -- between countercultural optimism and world-weary realism.</p>
