        <p>IN an effort to make buildings and vehicles more energy efficient, and reduce energy consumption in the United States, researchers at Tufts University have developed a window that can regulate the amount of sunlight flowing into a building or car and the amount of heat flowing out.</p>
        <p>The technology, known as electrochromic "smart" windows, uses a relatively short pulse of electrical current to vary the transparency of two thin layers of material in the windows at various optical wavelengths. In cold weather, a window could be adjusted to allow the full amount of available sunlight through to warm a room, while in hot weather it could reflect the light, preventing it from warming the room.</p>

        <p>IN an effort to make buildings and vehicles more energy efficient, and reduce energy consumption in the United States, researchers at Tufts University have developed a window that can regulate the amount of sunlight flowing into a building or car and the amount of heat flowing out.</p>
        <p>The technology, known as electrochromic "smart" windows, uses a relatively short pulse of electrical current to vary the transparency of two thin layers of material in the windows at various optical wavelengths. In cold weather, a window could be adjusted to allow the full amount of available sunlight through to warm a room, while in hot weather it could reflect the light, preventing it from warming the room.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ronald Goldner, a professor who is leading the research at the Electro-Optics Technology Center at Tufts University in Medford, Mass., said that his group had successfully tested small window cells and that he hoped the windows would be available in a few years.</p>
        <p>The costs of production and difficulties with performance have discouraged many companies from commercial applications so far. But the Nissan Motor Corporation, a subsidiary of Nissan Motor Company Ltd. of Japan, is developing a thin-film electrochromic window using different materials for sunroofs in its automobiles.</p>
        <p>"Smart" windows could reduce energy consumption because buildings equipped with them would need fewer lights and air-conditioners. Any reduction in energy use in turn could slow the effects of global warming by limiting the amount of "greenhouse" gases released by power plants.  Estimated 50% Savings in Energy</p>
        <p>The technology could reduce a building's energy costs by 30 to 50 percent, according to the Solar Industries Association in Washington. Office buildings, which account for about one-third, or $150 billion, of all energy consumed in the United States annually, lose roughly 25 percent of their energy by undesirable loss or gain of heat through windows.</p>
        <p>"We're in a funny time when environmental concerns like global warming issues and indoor air quality are having a direct influence on each other," said Barry G. Donaldson, executive vice president of the Tishman Research Corporation and chairman of the Intelligent Buildings Institute in Washington, an industry group that examines ways to make buildings more energy efficient. "You can put brains into a window, or a light fixture, or a fan, so they can all speak to each other and work for a better environment."</p>
        <p>The idea for an electrochromic window has been around since 1974. David M. Pellish, an architect at the Department of Energy, put together a committee at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico in 1983 to suggest research that would lead to more energy-efficient buildings. At that meeting he discussed the technology with Dr. Goldner, and the project to develop a "smart" window was begun that year at Tufts with a Federal grant of $89,000. Since then, three groups have been part of the Energy Department research team: the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a Government-supported laboratory near Denver; E.I.C., an energy research group in Norwood, Mass., and Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in California.</p>
        <p>"It's not a question of if this technology works," Mr. Pellish said. "It's only a matter of when and what companies will go with it."</p>
        <p>Dr. Goldner said: "Part of the dream 25 years ago was to help the world go solar. Now we're coming a step closer. What has been learned from the research so far should result not only in energy-conserving windows, but also in high-power, rechargeable thin-film batteries with a large amount of energy per unit of mass. Such batteries could be used in electric vehicles, with one battery replacing more than 60 conventional lead-acid batteries." Production Challenges</p>
        <p>The production of electrochromic windows has a lot in common with the manufacturing of computer chips. Costs are high because the materials must often be applied in many steps, and even a fingerprint can contaminate the components. Production still takes place in rooms that are not automated and look more like workshops than factories.</p>
        <p>Indeed, producing a durable, working "smart" window is more challenging than Dr. Goldner and Mr. Pellish predicted. "We're still solving the nitty, gritty problems, including basic materials research and trouble shooting," Dr. Goldner said.</p>
        <p>Though other types of "smart" windows exist, such as those using liquid crystals, none of the others have the ability to vary the amount of transmitted and reflected light in different parts of the spectrum, nor can they maintain a given optical state without continuous application of electrical power.</p>
        <p>The window's interior surface is coated with five very thin basic layers, and the total thickness of the coating is approximately 40-millionths of an inch. Two of the layers are made up of electrochromic materials, whose transparency and reflectivity change when electrons and small charge-compensating ions are inserted into or removed from the layers, which occurs when a pulse of electrical current is passed through them. One of the layers is made of tungsten trioxide and the other is made of lithium cobalt dioxide.</p>
        <p>Depending upon the size of the current pulse, a continuum of optical states can be produced, from transparent to opaque, allowing varying amounts of energy to go through the window.</p>
