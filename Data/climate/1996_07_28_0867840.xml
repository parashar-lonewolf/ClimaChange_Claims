        <p>WHEN a large family gathered for a barbecue last Sunday in Westwood, Mass., the inevitable jabs were made at several smokers in the group. But rather than defending themselves, they came up with a quick and unusual riposte: their cigarettes were not nearly as bad for the environment as the Jeeps and other sport utility vehicles crawling the suburb's streets.</p>
        <p>Like the distant growl of an approaching Chevrolet Suburban, the first signs  of a backlash against sport vehicles are emerging. While the vehicles continue to fly off the dealers' lots, some people are objecting that they burn too much  gasoline and spew out too much pollution.</p>
        <p>The University of California at Berkeley Wellness Letter, which calls itself "the newsletter of nutrition, fitness and stress management," announces in a headline across the front page of its July issue: "The New Gas Guzzlers: A U-Turn Toward Air Pollution."</p>
        <p>The Sierra Club plans a similar article for a late autumn issue of its magazine. "The auto industry refuses to provide safe, non-polluting family vehicles," said Daniel F. Becker, the group's director of global warming and energy programs.</p>
        <p>Even Newsweek chimed in last week with an item on shoes called Land Rovers. "But in order to stay completely true to their four-wheel namesakes," the item said, "the shoes will also have to get appallingly bad mileage."</p>
        <p>What, Us Worry?</p>
        <p>Auto industry officials reply that as long as America's gas prices remain the lowest in the industrialized world, consumers will want high, hulking sport  vehicles instead of fuel-sipping small cars. "What you're seeing is perhaps an intellectual backlash, but you haven't seen any evidence of that in the consumer arena," said Sam A. Leonard, the director of vehicle emissions and fuel efficiency at the General Motors Corporation.</p>
        <p>Sales of sport utility vehicles have grown steadily this year. Chevrolet and  GMC dealers have waiting lists for the Suburban, the biggest of the behemoths, which gets only 13 miles to the gallon in the city.</p>
        <p>Gas mileage is appalling for most other sport utility vehicles, too; a Jeep Grand Cherokee with a V-8 engine gets 14 miles to the gallon in the city and 18  on the highway. Substituting a V-6 engine -- which fewer and fewer seem inclined to do -- only adds a mile per gallon in the city and two on the highway. And these are official ratings under criteria set by the Environmental Protection Agency; many drivers find that the actual performance is a little worse.</p>
        <p>The gasoline is a big expense. "I might as well be throwing dollars out the window as the miles pass," said Pepper Schwartz, a University of Washington sociology professor who drives a dark blue Suburban and whose husband drives a red and gray Suburban.</p>
        <p>Sport vehicles also emit more air pollution than most of the cars they are replacing, although they are much cleaner than cars of the early 1970's. The Federal Government classifies sport utility vehicles as light trucks, not cars,  which are permitted to emit two to three times as much unburned fuel, soot particles and other pollutants.</p>
        <p>The burning of each gallon of gas puts an estimated 19 pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Some scientists believe that rising carbon dioxide  emissions could contribute to global warming and disruptive climate changes.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Schwartz contends that the big vehicles are essential for the long roads of the Pacific Northwest. "Even though we're extremely good about nuts, berries and owls, we sure need our cars," she said. "On the East Coast, it's easy for opinion makers to be high and mighty because they don't own a car or they only take it out on weekends or they're so worried about crime that they don't put much into it."</p>
        <p>Auto makers have spent millions advertising an image of sport utility vehicle owners as people who love the outdoors and roam national parks. Even some environmentalists have bought them.</p>
        <p>"I drive a Jeep Cherokee, but I live up a half-mile track in the country," said Adam C. Markham, the director of the Washington-based World Wildlife Fund's climate change program.</p>
        <p>Mr. Becker at the Sierra Club had a compromise answer to the debate at the barbecue last weekend over cigarettes and sport utility vehicles. "For the smoker, it is worse to smoke," he said. "For the planet, cigarette smoking doesn't create a serious problem -- auto pollution does."</p>
        <p>Ed Lechtzin, a General Motors spokesman, contended that the real air pollution offense at the barbecue in Westwood was neither the smoking nor the sport utility vehicles. The biggest offender, he said, was the charcoal and lighter fluid.</p>
        <p>The partygoers, it turns out, shared that worry. Colleen A. Askin, a smoker,  reported that the charcoal was piled in the grill with care and the lighter fluid was ready to be poured when the guests decided the charcoal taste was not worth the harm to the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>So they used citronella to roust some bees from a hive next to a more environmentally correct gas grill and used that instead.</p>
