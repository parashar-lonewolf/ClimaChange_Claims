        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>While I appreciate your portrayal of the dangers posed to the low-lying islands of the Maldives by global warming and sea-level rise in "Male Journal: 1,190 Islands in Danger: Sea Could Drown Them" (Nov. 26), I would like to clarify allegations made in "South Asian Nations, in Turmoil, Will Meet" (news article, Nov. 26), on the fifth South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation summit meeting that began Nov. 21 in the Maldives. You state that the Government prepared for the meeting by "locking up more than a dozen intellectuals and politicians who might criticize a Government that no longer tolerates opposition."</p>
        <p>These are baseless stories fabricated by a few individuals who are out to discredit the Government for their own political ends. To put the record straight, I must say some arrests did take place in connection with recent subversive acts and arson. This had nothing to do with the Asian summit meeting. No scholars or anyone else who can fit the description of "intellectuals" were among those arrested. The Government, as usual, insured full compliance with the law in making the arrests. Those arrested are treated well.</p>
        <p>The law relating to detention of suspects specifies the maximum number of days one can be kept in custody for questioning. Anyone detained will be released at the end of this period. Should there be legal grounds for prosecution, such action will then follow our judicial procedures. HUSSEIN MANIKFAN  Ambassador and United Nations Representative, Republic of Maldives New York, Dec. 5, 1990</p>
