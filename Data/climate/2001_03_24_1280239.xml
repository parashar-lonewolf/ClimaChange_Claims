        <p>In the beginning, there was water. And it was good. But a dairy in Jamaica, Queens, has a hunch that the almighty formula is in need of an elemental makeover.</p>
        <p>There should be more O's in H2 O, according to Henry Schwartz, the chief executive of the company, Elmhurst Dairy. And if Mr. Schwartz is right, O's of a different sort -- the kind ahead of the decimal point in earnings figures -- should flow abundantly as well.</p>
        <p>''The people who drink our water say they drink more of it and in many cases they feel more invigorated,'' Mr. Schwartz said of the company's new water product, Oxygen8. ''That may be something that you can't prove, but it sure is interesting.''</p>
        <p>Oxygen8 is an oxygen-boosted spring water, which, according to Elmhurst Dairy, gives the drinker eight times the amount of oxygen as naturally occurs in water. It is among the latest splashes in the $5.7 billion bottled water market, which is awash with novelty beverages all across the country, including other oxygenated waters, that seek to improve upon the time-tested formula of two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen -- notwithstanding the occasional twist of lemon.</p>
        <p>Water Joe is packed with caffeine. Glaceau Smart Water is vapor distilled and enhanced with electrolytes. Phuse is infused with herbal remedies and vitamins. Elan Natural Waters are tinged with clove and anisette. Ginseng Lift is fortified with ginseng extract and green tea.</p>
        <p>Why would anyone want a glass of water stuffed with oxygen or electrolytes or, for that matter, green tea? ''I try to keep up with this stuff, but as far as I can tell, it is all about marketing,'' said Jim M. Brown, executive editor of the Georgia Tech Sports Medicine &amp; Performance Newsletter, who tracks the health claims associated with many of the new products. ''Just because companies sell it doesn't mean there is science behind it.''</p>
        <p>The head trainer for the New York Jets, David Price, said science could be less important than perception when it came to novelty waters. During much of a two-year testing period, Oxygen8 was provided free of charge to the Jets. One of the first shipments arrived just before a playoff game against Denver. Elmhurst Dairy suggested it might compensate for the oxygen-thin atmosphere at Mile High Stadium. The Jets finished the first half leading the Broncos by 10 points. But during halftime the Oxygen8 ran out, or so the company's story goes. The Broncos won, as they often do on their home field.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes what people perceive is more important than what actually is,'' Mr. Price said. ''There is a perception in our training room that we feel Oxygen8 is a good product and that is why we put it here, so the players feel it is a valuable product. We have spring water and Oxygen8, but the players with a choice choose the Oxygen8.''</p>
        <p>The trend toward functional waters, as the novelty beverages are known in the bottled water industry, is being driven by a market that is booming but increasingly dominated by a few big multinational companies like Perrier, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, according to beverage analysts.</p>
        <p>For small companies to thrive, they have to bring something unique to the table, said Gary Hemphill, a senior vice president at the Beverage Marketing Corporation. In the case of oxygen-enriched waters, companies have been trying since 1997 with some success. ''Water with a little extra something added,'' Mr. Hemphill said, ''whether oxygen or caffeine, is the next evolution in the bottled water category.''</p>
        <p>Elmhurst Dairy used to limit its water offerings to Mountainside Springs, a home-delivery spring water from the Catskill Mountains. Oxygen8 starts with the same spring water, which is then chilled and injected with pressurized oxygen. The oxygen, in the form of tiny bubbles that give a slight tingle but are otherwise barely detectable, is sustained in five-gallon jugs of the water through a contraption the company said was invented by Jason Ritton, 23.</p>
        <p>The contraption fits inside a dispenser, which looks much like any other office water cooler except that it seems to rumble a bit more and the Oxygen8 shoots out with the force of a car wash hose. Because the highly concentrated oxygen is difficult to keep contained, Oxygen8 is available only in big glass bottles (glass is less permeable than plastic) and with the special dispenser.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ritton apparently had no official job title at the company's bottling plant in Worcester, N.Y., until a reporter recently asked for one. His boss, Dennis E. Crowley, quickly anointed him operations manager. ''It is pretty good,'' Mr. Ritton said of the water during a demonstration of the soon-to-be-patented design in a test laboratory in Jamaica.</p>
        <p>In a bottled water market where H2 O could easily mean hyperbole twice over, Elmhurst Dairy is trying to make big waves for Oxygen8 without going overboard.</p>
        <p>The most sensational data about Oxygen8 provided by the company are charts that indicate a greater oxygen content in the blood of people who drink the water about 90 seconds after swallowing it, based on blood tests of about 50 volunteer drinkers. A publicity statement concluded that Oxygen8 was ''energy boosting'' and said added oxygen in the blood stream ''helps expedite the healing process in the body.''</p>
        <p>''We have been very careful to say that you can't make any specific health claims, but who knows, more oxygen has to be good for you,'' said Glenn Butler, the president of Life Support Technologies, who conducted the tests at Mount Vernon Hospital in Mount Vernon, N.Y., where his company provides hyperbaric oxygen therapy.</p>
        <p>''I don't know why, but here at the hospital people will walk past several other water coolers, even from other floors, to get to drink this stuff,'' Mr. Butler said. ''We have to keep it locked up.''</p>
        <p>Other entrants in the oxygenated-water market have also tried to walk the fine line between fact and fiction, with varying degrees of determination. In the past, some have suggested that their O's would do everything from ''improve mental clarity'' to shave up to 30 seconds off a runner's five-kilometer time. An upcoming oxygenated water, SerVen Rich, is being marketed by the tennis stars Serena and Venus Williams and their father, Richard Williams, in conjunction with Aqua Clara Bottling and Distribution in Florida.</p>
        <p>A news release posted on the Internet last week announcing the new brand almost made it seem as if the water had rendered the Williams's lungs obsolete.</p>
        <p>''It's the water my daughters, Serena and Venus, rely on during their training,'' Richard Williams said in the statement. ''It offers them the oxygen they need while on the court, as well as water without that bitter aftertaste.''</p>
        <p>Some health and fitness experts can barely conceal their disdain for the hype that sometimes surrounds oxygenated waters, which can cost twice as much as ordinary spring water. (A five-gallon jug of Oxygen8 sells for $14.95.)</p>
        <p>''Putting oxygenated water into the stomach could result in an expensive burp,'' said Howard G. Knuttgen, a lecturer in the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at Harvard University and the editor in chief of The Georgia Tech newsletter. ''Oxygen or any other gas can be forced into solution in water by pressure, as is accomplished with carbon dioxide in carbonated beverages. When the surrounding pressure is reduced, as with the opening of a soft-drink bottle, the gas in the fluid begins to escape.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Knuttgen and other skeptics point out that no scientific studies have been published in reputable journals to support the use of oxygenated water for health or athletic benefits. In a detailed explanation sent by e-mail, Mr. Knuttgen said that the idea of ''preloading blood in the intestines with oxygen before the blood goes to the lungs makes no physiological sense.''</p>
        <p>''Athletes are continually searching for ways to enhance performance and gain a competitive edge,'' he added. ''Therefore, they are extremely vulnerable to fads and fictions.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Crowley, who has overseen development of Oxygen8 for Elmhurst Dairy, does not mind the skepticism. He acknowledged that a lot more research needed to be conducted into the health benefits of the water. Even he was startled when he recently read a claim on the Internet that oxygenated water would help enlarge a woman's breasts.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Mr. Crowley said, Elmhurst Dairy expects Oxygen8 to catch on in New York, where people are already hooked on hydration. The company is exploring the idea of installing vending machines at airports so that arriving passengers, dehydrated from their travels, can get a quick water fix. It is also developing a compact model of the cooler to better fit in New York apartments.</p>
        <p>Perhaps most strategically, the company said it was continuing to offer the Jets a price break. The Jets go through about 75 gallons every two weeks, Mr. Crowley said, and although the team has offered no formal endorsement, the tale about the game against Denver is the stuff of a marketing legend. ''Yes, we like to name drop with the Jets,'' Mr. Crowley said. ''We all remember what happened in the second half.''</p>
