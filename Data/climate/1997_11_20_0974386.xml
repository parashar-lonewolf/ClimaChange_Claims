        <p>Ted Turner, who has promised to give $1 billion to the United Nations over the next decade, today named the man who will allocate the money, the largest donation ever made to the organization. He is Timothy E. Wirth, a former Senator from Colorado who is now the Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wirth, who is involved in environmental and population issues, is to leave the State Department at the end of December to become president of what will be called the United Nations Foundation. United Nations officials are meeting today and Thursday with representatives of Mr. Turner to discuss areas in which the new foundation will work.</p>
        <p>The impending departure of Mr. Wirth from the Administration clouds an international conference on Dec. 1 in Kyoto, Japan, on a treaty to fight global warming. As the top State Department official dealing with environmental issues, he was the lead negotiator in those talks.</p>
        <p>People in environmental organizations who have worked with Mr. Wirth said today that he appeared to be unhappy with the Administration's policy, which did not meet the hopes of Europeans and others that the United States would move faster to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
        <p>''He is passionate on these issues, said Jonathan Lash, executive director of the World Resources Institute in Washington. ''He was often Horatius at the bridge.''</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Wirth, 57, brushed aside differences with the Administration and said he accepted Mr. Turner's offer because he could not resist ''an incredible opportunity'' to help shape a new generation of foundations and concentrate on global issues in an international setting.</p>
        <p>He said he would be part fund-raiser, increasing the seed money of Mr. Turner's grant of stock and cash; part networker, drawing on the growing number and strength of private organizations around the world, and part public advocate for the United Nations as it focuses increasingly on 21st century themes.</p>
        <p>''People care a great deal about these new issues, the new global issues, post-cold-war issues,'' he said, mentioning immigration and population growth, the environment, terrorism, narcotics, international crime and the world economy.</p>
        <p>''These are the new issues,'' he said. ''We have these new issues and in a way you have old bottles. You have systems set up at the State Department and elsewhere that were designed for a cold-war era.''</p>
        <p>Joseph E. Connor, Under Secretary General of the United Nations for Administration and Management, said today that the United Nations had presented the Turner group with 10 areas in which the new foundation could concentrate its efforts, from poverty to education and help for refugees.</p>
        <p>The United Nations has named Angela Kane, a German who has been in charge of the organization's library and electronic informations, as its representative at the trust fund.</p>
        <p>Directors of United Nations programs will have to compete for the Turner money, which will be spent at the rate of about $25 million a quarter. Grants are expected to begin in early 1998.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wirth said today that he considered Mr. Turner ''a man of enormous vision and genius'' with whom he has shared a number of important interests over the years. While in the Senate, Mr. Wirth supported -- among other things -- the loosening of broadcasting monopolies held by large commercial networks, which was a boon to Mr. Turner's Cable News Network.</p>
        <p>Both men also share an interest in bringing economic forces into solving environmental problems, Mr. Wirth said. ''I have known Ted Turner for 20 years,'' he said, ''and have always admired the way in which he fought in a very mold-breaking fashion.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Turner said in a statement today: ''Tim Wirth shares my vision for the future, in which the public and private sectors work side by side to improve global quality of life and rebuild the spirit of and support for the United Nations.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wirth, who was born in New Mexico, grew up in Colorado and graduated from Harvard and Stanford, where he received a Ph.D. in education, said Americans are much more interested in global issues and world affairs than politicians think.</p>
