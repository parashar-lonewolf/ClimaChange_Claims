        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The Bush Administration's use of appointed, unelected "Cabinet level" panels to eviscerate major environmental laws deserves more scrutiny. The stunning "override" of the Endangered Species Act by a panel of Bush appointees (front page, May 15) and the efforts of Vice President Quayle's Council on Competitiveness, another so-called Cabinet-level panel, to gut the Clean Air Act should prompt vigorous debate on whether or not the power exercised by these panels is legitimate or a flagrant abuse of the governmental process.</p>
        <p>More is at stake than foul air and loss of old-growth forests. When people follow due process and work for a law, and it is enacted by their elected representatives, they have every right to expect it to remain intact. When laws are systematically dismantled by panels that are havens for industry lobbyists and party fund raisers who could not advance their agendas through the legislative process, fundamental questions arise.</p>

        <p>The Bush Administration's use of appointed, unelected "Cabinet level" panels to eviscerate major environmental laws deserves more scrutiny. The stunning "override" of the Endangered Species Act by a panel of Bush appointees (front page, May 15) and the efforts of Vice President Quayle's Council on Competitiveness, another so-called Cabinet-level panel, to gut the Clean Air Act should prompt vigorous debate on whether or not the power exercised by these panels is legitimate or a flagrant abuse of the governmental process.</p>
        <p>More is at stake than foul air and loss of old-growth forests. When people follow due process and work for a law, and it is enacted by their elected representatives, they have every right to expect it to remain intact. When laws are systematically dismantled by panels that are havens for industry lobbyists and party fund raisers who could not advance their agendas through the legislative process, fundamental questions arise.</p>
        <p>Word has it that industry lobbyists no longer worry too much about what happens in Congress; they can get what they want elsewhere, outside of the pesky legislative arena.</p>
        <p>The disturbing possibility that our air, water, old-growth forests and spotted owls are being sold to enrich Bush campaign coffers merits at least as much press attention as the Gennifer Flowers hoopla, and the latest quid pro quo was hard to miss: the day after the Republican $9 million fund-raising dinner, President Bush announced yet another three-month delay in implementing the Clean Air Act. The only question remaining here is how much the Clean Air Act sold for.</p>
        <p>The Administration's latest accomplishment, weakening international global warming initiatives to be considered at the Rio Earth Summit, is a national disgrace. SUSAN RUSSELL Little Silver, N.J., May 18, 1992 The writer is a lobbyist for wildlife.</p>
