        <p>LEAD: Unless this winter turns out to be particularly brutal, natural gas prices are unlikely to rise much above last winter's peak, many industry executives say.</p>
        <p>Unless this winter turns out to be particularly brutal, natural gas prices are unlikely to rise much above last winter's peak, many industry executives say.</p>
        <p>Natural gas producers believe that the surplus, or ''bubble,'' that has kept prices down in recent years may finally be disappearing. But natural gas is increasingly in competition with oil, and oil prices are low, so even the end of the surplus would not lift gas prices much.</p>
        <p>''Is it going to end? Yes,'' said Charles T. Maxwell, senior energy strategist at C. J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc., speaking of the surplus. ''Will it make any difference? No.'' As soon as gas prices rise, many customers shift to oil, which some can do with the flip of a switch. That option holds down gas prices even for customers who cannot switch, like homeowners. Customers who can switch easily account for nearly a third of the nation's gas use.</p>
        <p>''If the producers are successful in driving the price of gas up quickly and we lose even half of the switchable customers to oil for the winter, that bubble would be back, and larger than ever,'' said Scott W. Gebhardt, chief operating officer of Access Energy, a natural gas marketing and transportation concern in Dublin, Ohio. Oil ''truly does create a ceiling for the price of gas,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Gas producers, who are gathering in Orlando, Fla., today to discuss the shape of the industry, see a miserable winter as their only hope for significant price increases.</p>
        <p>With gradually declining supplies and a slight resurgence of demand, some producers think the winter could bring spot shortages. Shortages, they believe, might change the perception in the marketplace that gas is in surplus and should therefore be cheap. Locking In Secure Supplies</p>
        <p>''All it has to do is happen in a few locations,'' said Richard J. Stegemeier, chairman of the Unocal Corporation, which operates production wells and pipelines. The result, he said, would be for gas users to try to lock in secure supplies with long-term contracts - for which they would be willing to pay a higher price.</p>
        <p>Even if that happens, however, residential customers would not see their bills jump sharply. The price charged by producers for gas at the wellhead accounts for only a portion of the final price that utilities charge customers. Transportation and distribution must also be factored in.</p>
        <p>The price that producers get for natural gas has been yanked up and down by the oil market in recent years, like a rowboat being towed by a submarine. The oil-price shock of 1979 stimulated gas drilling, vastly increasing supply. But when the price of oil declined in the early 1980's and collapsed in 1986, oil cut into the market share of gas, leaving a vast surplus. That bubble has persisted for so long that many analysts now call it ''the sausage.''</p>
        <p>Average wellhead prices went from more than $2.50 per thousand cubic feet in 1983 to about $1.70 last year. Prices on the spot market had an even wider range.</p>
        <p>Gas now sells on the spot market for about 20 cents more than it did at this time last year. In the New York area the price is $2.10 to $2.20 per thousand cubic feet. 'Over and We Didn't Know It'</p>
        <p>But the consensus among producers, pipeline companies and utilities is that the bubble is near an end, or is even gone already. ''Two years from now, when we look back at September 1988, we'll say the bubble was already over and we didn't know it,'' said Jack A. Dutton, executive vice president of the Tenneco Gas Marketing Company. The parent company, Tenneco, operates 20,000 miles of pipelines in 26 states.</p>
        <p>The end of the bubble would put prices on a gradual upward path, beginning this winter.</p>
        <p>''I think we'll see some seasonal price increases this winter which are going to reflect the fact that supply and demand are coming more close to being in sync,'' said Everett S. Gibbs, a specialist in natural gas at Arthur Andersen &amp; Company, the accounting firm. ''There is still more gas supply than there is demand, but in the wintertime those two are going to come together.''</p>
        <p>Some disagree. ''There is still more than sufficient surplus of deliverability to meet any reasonable demand,'' said Nicholas J. Bush, president of the Natural Gas Supply Association. And unlike some others in the industry, he does not think shortages would be beneficial. ''I don't think anyone wants that kind of attention on the industry,'' he said, because it would scare away potential customers. Gas Supplied 22.6%</p>
        <p>Last year, when total energy consumption was about 76 quadrillion B.T.U.'s, gas supplied 17.2 quadrillion, or 22.6 percent, and oil supplied 32.6 quadrillion, or 42.9 percent. (One quadrillion is 1 followed by 15 zeros.) Most of the rest came from coal.</p>
        <p>Most analysts expect demand for gas to be more than 17 trillion cubic feet this year, up from 16.1 trillion cubic feet last year, and put supply at about 18.5 trillion cubic feet. But the supply figure, known in the industry as ''deliverability,'' represents a year-round total, while most of the demand is in the winter.</p>
        <p>Gas storage is expensive and limited, so day-to-day deliverability is more important than the year-to-year figure, and there may be no surplus in some areas on a harsh winter day.</p>
        <p>''If it's a cold winter, you could see the last of the excess deliverability this year,'' said Dr. Marion B. Stewart of National Economic Research Associates, based in White Plains. ''It may well come to a screeching halt.'' Gas demand rose 13 percent in the first quarter of this year, and 6 percent in the second quarter, he estimated. Spot Shortages Last Winter</p>
        <p>There were some spot shortages last winter. In January, for example, industrial users in the Los Angeles area were told by gas suppliers to switch to oil.</p>
        <p>More such shortages are likely in the future, experts say, because supply has been declining. Low prices have led some producers to shut down their wells, hoping for higher prices later, and drilling is also down.</p>
        <p>''Discoveries were down 20 percent in 1987,'' said David C. Bradshaw, an analyst at Paine Webber, who said the 1987 levels were 20 percent below 1986. He said that last year discoveries amounted to only 44.5 percent of production. Since the exploration needed to increase discoveries will come only with higher prices, experts believe that such low discovery rates indicate that prices will eventually have to rise.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, demand for gas is being pushed up. One reason is the repeal earlier this year of the Fuel Use Act, which limited its use for making electricity. Another is environmental concerns; gas produces fewer air pollutants than oil or coal. It also produces less carbon dioxide, which would make gas a more attractive fuel if industrial users are told to control the emissions believed to cause the ''greenhouse effect.'' 'Treated as a Byproduct'</p>
        <p>Gas now generally sells at a discount to oil, said Mr. Maxwell of C. J. Lawrence. ''It's treated as a byproduct of oil.'' But because of pollution problems with oil and the fact that gas is a secure domestic fuel, he added, ''in the end, it will move to a premium price.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gibbs of Arthur Andersen said that one positive sign for gas was in new-home construction. His firm believes that last year, for the first time, natural gas was the heating system installed in more than half the houses built.</p>
