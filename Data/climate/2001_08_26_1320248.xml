        <p>RICHARD ARMITAGE, the deputy secretary of state, is known as a blunt-speaking, down-to-earth public official. He minced few words in Australia recently, and hit a nerve surprisingly raw for a country considered one of the United States's most dependable allies.</p>
        <p>The Bush administration has irritated many allies with its aversion to treaties, especially the Kyoto Protocol on global warming and the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. Mr. Armitage, however, raised hackles as he singled out a treaty that the administration is partial to: the Australian-New Zealand United States Treaty, or Anzus, a mutual defense pact signed at the start of the cold war.</p>
        <p>So partial, in fact, that the deputy secretary felt compelled to remind Australians that Americans would die to fulfill it -- and that Washington would expect an equal sacrifice.</p>
        <p>Blending what Australians interpreted as condescension and old-fashioned militarism, Mr. Armitage declared: ''I'm not sure all our friends here in Australia understand the significance of an alliance to Americans. It's not a matter of political convenience or economic interaction, although some of that, inevitably.</p>
        <p>''But for us, an alliance is an obligation, if necessary, to fight and die for each other. That's what it means. That's why an alliance is submitted to the U.S. Congress. It has to be debated. Because we're talking about, for the U.S. side, our sons and daughter fighting and dying if Australia comes under attack. And by the way, we're talking about Australian sons and daughters who would be willing to sacrifice their lives to help defend the United States.'' (New Zealand's children are safe: that country dropped out of the treaty because it objected to Washington's nuclear policies.)</p>
        <p>Now, Mr. Armitage likes Australia. He travels there relatively frequently, and has often expressed affection and admiration for the country. And Australians generally admire the United States. They cite common characteristics -- independence of spirit, absence of the British class system, love of sports and the outdoors. But -- usually beneath the surface -- there is also a streak of resentment at being bossed around by ''the Yanks.'' Memories of Australia's painful involvement in Vietnam, prompted by a request from Lyndon B. Johnson, still rankle.</p>
        <p>Australians worry that the United States may someday make a similar request over Taiwan. In fact, Mr. Armitage, visiting as a private citizen two years ago, angered Australians by suggesting that Washington would expect them to fight alongside Americans to protect Taiwan if the Chinese invaded.</p>
        <p>And his recent comments were widely interpreted as another preview of a call to arms over Taiwan -- even though he also said that the ''threat assessment'' on the likelihood for such a conflict ''has actually receded a fair amount.''</p>
        <p>SO the momentum of an anti-Armitage backlash gathered rather quickly. Leading the charge was a former prime minister, Malcolm Fraser. A conservative, Mr. Fraser said in the newspaper The Australian that years ago, American officials ''would not even dream of telling Australia publicly what we must do.''</p>
        <p>''That such people are now prepared to tell Australians this,'' he wrote, ''represents a fundamental change in Anzus.''</p>
        <p>He went on to suggest that Australia reduce its efforts to maintain a strong relationship with Washington, and replace it by a greater emphasis on improved relations with Asian nations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fraser was actually being quite polite. Irritated by the Bush administration's heavy hand, he suggested Australia should withdraw from Anzus altogether. That was, coincidentally, about a month before President Bush's announcement last week that America would, at some point, withdraw from one of its own scorned pacts: the 1972 ABM Treaty.</p>
