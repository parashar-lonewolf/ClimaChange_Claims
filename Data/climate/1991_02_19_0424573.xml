        <p>War in the Gulf A6-8</p>

        <p>Army's commander in gulf is sidelined for surgery A6</p>
        <p>Military analysis: The skirmishes along the Saudi border and inside Iraq are part of an allied effort to gain battlefield intelligence and con fuse Iraq about the main points of an attack, Pentagon officials say. A7</p>
        <p>Interrogation of Iraqi war prisoners reveals a portrait of battle-weary front-line forces who in many cases are hungry, demoralized and bitter about fighting a war few soldiers support, intelligence officers say. A7</p>
        <p>Children with fathers in the gulf war are consumed by events in Saudi Arabia. Near a Marine base in California, they draw bloody pictures of Saddam Hussein and miss school so their mothers won't be alone.  A8</p>
        <p>Aid from Congress to help soldiers deal with economic hardships at home may be approved soon as legislators rush to provide benefits to troops in the Persian Gulf.  A12</p>
        <p>A man burns himself in a peace gesture A12</p>
        <p>Business people are traveling again after a month of avoiding trips because of the war, raising international airlines' hopes that business will steadily improve.  D1  International A3-5, A10-11</p>
        <p>Two bombs were set off in London at railroad stations, killing one man and wounding 40. The police were quick to blame the Irish Republican Army, which fired a mortar attack on 10 Downing Street 11 days ago. A1</p>
        <p>Prices in the Soviet Union will rise no less than 60 percent under the Kremlin's latest plan to revive the critically troubled economy. The plan affects all but three Soviet necessities: medicine, fuel and vodka. A1</p>
        <p>Ribare Journal: For the dead,TV and other comforts A4</p>
        <p>A Vietnamese refugee in Hong Kong who was denied refugee status must have his case reheard, a judge ruled in the first court challenge to the nation's screening of boat people. A3</p>

        <p>Chicago's politics have calmed down since the election of Mayor Richard M. Daley, the son of the longtime Democratic boss. He has brought stability to the fractious city and is favored for re-election. A1</p>
        <p>The tar of the savings and loan crisis, fairly or unfairly, is clearly upon the bankers. And as a result, the prospects for the kind of sweeping reform and innovation bankers say they need do not appear at all bright. D1</p>
        <p>Public concern about chemical waste prompted Texas to temporarily ban development of new commercial hazardous-waste sites and stop expansions of existing ones. It is the first state with such regulations. A12</p>

        <p>Municipal contracts waste millions in New York City because of a lack of competition in bidding for goods and services, experts say. Sparse competition can mean poor service, higher costs, bid-rigging and bribery. A1</p>
        <p>Are car alarms worth the headache? New York and other states mandate insurance discounts for cars with alarms, but many who have been woken up at 2 A.M. wonder why it is not public policy to outlaw them. A1</p>
        <p>New York City's sliding economy now faces the decline of one of its last sources of strength: government spending and hiring. Mayor Dinkins's plans for layoffs could alter the city's reliance on public spending. B1</p>
        <p>Security guards at the Meadowlands are the focus of a grand jury investigation. Cases of patrons being beaten-- plus the death of two rock fans since 1989 -- prompted allegations that the guards are too tough. B1</p>
