        <p>LEAD: Governor Cuomo, whose first term won low marks from many environmentalists, has started the second with an effort to improve his record on protecting the state's natural resources.</p>
        <p>Governor Cuomo, whose first term won low marks from many environmentalists, has started the second with an effort to improve his record on protecting the state's natural resources.</p>
        <p>Over the last three months, he has presided over the approval of the largest state environmental bond act in history, proposed a 40 percent increase in staff to oversee toxic-waste cleanup in the state and nominated a highly regarded environmentalist to be the Commissioner for the state's Environmental Conservation Department.</p>
        <p>In addition, a statewide solid-waste disposal plan, mandated by the Legislature six years ago, was finally released last month. It was completed in response to an executive ultimatum, according to environmental officials. 'Political Awareness'</p>
        <p>As with just about everything else the Governor has done recently, these developments have prompted speculation that he is reviewing his record with the Presidency in mind.</p>
        <p>''There's a political awareness that these issues are very important to voters across the country,'' said Judith Enck, executive director of the Environmental Planning Lobby, a statewide coalition of environmental groups. ''It can only help the Governor to be on the right side, especially if he's running against Gary Hart, who has quite a strong environmental record.''</p>
        <p>Whether the Governor has running for President in mind, though, the developments of recent months indicate his administration has decided a new commitment of resources and talent is needed to address the state's growing environmental problems.</p>
        <p>Increasingly, these problems, many environmentalists and state officials say, are becoming ones that immediately affect municipal policy and development, making their solution more pressing both to politicians and to the public. On Long Island, for example, the threat of ground-water contamination has introduced the possible need for construction moratoriums.</p>
        <p>In New York City, failure to meet Federal standards for ozone pollution could cost hundreds of millions of dollars in highway funds. Across the state, municipalities are struggling to find ways to dispose of garbage as leaky and overloaded landfills are closed. 'Becoming More Obvious'</p>
        <p>''Environmental problems are becoming more obvious,'' said one environmentalist. ''They're becoming part of the state management agenda. You can't have 1,200 toxic dumps just lying around indefinitely.''</p>
        <p>Publicly, advisers to the Governor say recent developments do not indicate that environmental issues have been given a higher priority, but rather represent the culmination of four years of behind-the-scenes preparations. ''It's in the first term that all the spadework is done,'' said the director of state operations, Henrik N. Dullea.</p>
        <p>Privately, some say the administration recognized the need for, as one adviser put it, ''some remedial work'' on Mr. Cuomo's environmental record.</p>
        <p>During his first term, the Governor was often criticized for giving short shrift to issues such as toxic-waste cleanup, air and water protection and solid-waste disposal. While states such as California and New Jersey, for instance, were taking aggressive action to reduce the danger of toxic waste, New York, many environmentalists said, was lagging behind.</p>
        <p>Tensions between the Governor's office and environmentalists were exacerbated last summer, when pressure from the office led to cancellation of a speech critical of the administration at a statewide environmental conference. The speech was to have been given by Robert Boyle, the head of the Hudson River Fishermen's Association.</p>
        <p>Criticisms of the administration have been firmly rejected by the Governor's office, which has cited accomplishments such as an expanded state Superfund program and a tough state law on acid rain that would reduce sulfur emissions in the state by 40 percent. 'Cornerstone' of Program</p>
        <p>But it is the Environmental Quality Bond Act, which the Governor pressed to put on the ballot last year, that the administration has labeled the ''cornerstone'' of its environmental program. The bond act, which New York voters passed by a 2-to-1 margin in November, allocates $1.2 billion to toxic-waste cleanup and $250 million for land acquisition.</p>
        <p>With the act's passage came the need for an administrative agency capable of transforming millions of dollars into concrete achievements. And environmentalists have long been critical of the State Environmental Conservation Department and its Commissioner, Henry G. Williams. The Governor has nominated him as a member of the Public Service Commission.</p>
        <p>To help the department fulfill its increased mandate, the Governor proposed adding 74 positions, plus 71 in related departments. But several environmental groups have said these increases, while significant, are insufficient. They have pointed out that a 1985 legislative report showed the environmental agency lost ground in terms of budget increases during the 1970's while all other state agencies gained.</p>
        <p>The Governor, in what aides said was an unrelated move, has nominated a new Commissioner to head the department, Thomas C. Jorling, now the head of the Center for Environmental Studies at Williams College. The nomination requires State Senate approval.</p>
        <p>Praising the choice, John Adams, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said, ''I think the Governor recognized that his strong positions on the environment needed to be backed by an administrative leader.''  CUOMO AND ENVIROMENT</p>
