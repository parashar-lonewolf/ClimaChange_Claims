        <p>Peerless Clothing of Montreal has done so well in shipping its men's suits to the United States that it has emerged as one of the final stumbling blocks in the long negotiations for a North American Free Trade agreement.  [ Page D1. ]  Canadian, Mexican and American negotiators continued to work toward a free trade accord without resolving the final details that still divide them.  [ D3. ]</p>

        <p>The National Energy Security Act appeared on its way to swift passage after Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait. But after two years of fits and starts, the legislation faces a few more hurdles in a House-Senate conference committee.  [ D2. ]</p>
        <p>With a 74-foot gash in its hull, the Queen Elizabeth 2 began steaming slowly toward drydock in Boston after the last of its 1,800 passengers were safely evacuated to Newport, R.I. A team of investigators arrived to prepare for a public hearing into why the Cunard flagship hit an unmarked underwater obstacle.  [ A12. ]  The accident is unlikely to hurt the finances of the Cunard Line or the health of the cruise industry.  [ A12. ] Companies</p>
        <p>Southwestern Bell and Bell South reached agreement with their unions, and three other regional phone companies continued to negotiate past the expiration of labor contracts.  [ A10. ]</p>
        <p>Raychem won a $100 million contract to help provide modern telephone service in the former East Germany. In the process, it will test advanced features incorporating fiber optics.  [ D2. ]</p>
        <p>Intel has announced a faster version of its fastest microprocessor. The 486 DX2 chip runs internally at 66 megahertz.  [ D3. ] The Media Business</p>
        <p>The newsprint business has rarely, if ever, seen worse days. There is a glut of newsprint, but demand from newspapers is tepid because of the recession. Indeed, the business is so bad that newspapers are concerned about the financial health of newsprint manufacturers. Alex S. Jones: Press.  [ D6. ]</p>
        <p>Reebok is retiring its 'Dan and Dave' ads. Faced with yet another twist in the saga of the two U.S. athletes -- Dave Johnson's failure to win more than a bronze medal at the Olympics -- the shoe company is ending the costly and controversial campaign.  [ D6. ]</p>
        <p>New advertising for Quaker Rice Cakes is helping Quaker Oats to achieve strong gains in sales volume and market share, by reshaping longstanding negative attitudes about how the product tastes. Stuart Elliott: Advertising.  [ D7. ]</p>
        <p>Was The Advocate's hard-won image as a serious magazine damaged by the resignation of its editor in chief? The editor, Richard Rouilard, had engaged in well-publicized bickering with the publisher of The Advocate, the largest magazine for gay men and lesbians.  [ D6. ]  Many of the largest radio stations have no qualms about paying $1 million or more to stars of morning programs.  [ D6. ] Today's Column</p>
        <p>Wall Street analysts can earn as much as $1 million a year, and superstars among them can demand a private session to interrogate a company's top management about its business strategy. So why aren't these powerful analysts better at predicting the earnings of the companies they follow? Market Place.  [ D1. ]</p>
