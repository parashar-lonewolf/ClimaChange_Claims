        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.</p>
        <p>Now Playing</p>
        <p>''AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS.'' Starring Jackie Chan and Steve Coogan. Directed by Frank Coraci. (PG, 125 minutes.) Sometimes nonsense makes good sense. The latest remake of Jules Verne's 1873 globetrotting fantasy is a deliriously silly caper that goes out of its way to thumb its nose at logic. This swatch of epic slapstick, in which three madcap adventurers from London play beat-the-clock in a race to circle the earth, is really a silent comedy with spoken subtitles. What distinguishes this rendition from the nearly three-hour 1956 version, which won the Oscar for best picture, is the presence of that coiled human whirlwind Jackie Chan. As Passepartout, the loyal valet to the fanatical British inventor Phileas Fogg (Mr. Coogan), Mr. Chan makes his entrance diving out of a window in a Keystone Kops-style chase. The whiz-bang set pieces in which he fends off teams of assailants in exotic locales are the movie's high points. The film's witty Rube Goldberg-worthy contraptions remind us that until today's high tech environment, machines used to be funny. It's refreshing and perhaps even useful to see a movie that shows how susceptible to breakdown they really are. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Kathy Bates put in amusing cameos (Stephen Holden).</p>

        <p>''THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW,'' starring Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal. Directed by Roland Emmerich (PG-13, 117 minutes). Tornadoes in Los Angeles. Hail in Tokyo. The entire Northern Hemisphere encased in a sheet of ice, with uncountable casualties, including life as we know it. All of which adds up, in the hands of Mr. Emmerich, to a sprawling, oddly lighthearted action picture. The computer-generated special effects are awesome, though not in the traditional sense of the word. As you watch cities obliterated by wind, water and ice, you don't think, ''My God, how horrible''; you think, ''Cool!'' The only one who seems genuinely worried is Mr. Quaid, playing a scientist whose apocalyptic warnings are ignored until it's too late. He sets out to find his son (Mr. Gyllenhaal), who is stranded at the New York Public Library and who seems, all in all, pretty relaxed. Like most disaster films, this one is ultimately more soothing than alarming, which may undermine its supposed ambition to raise awareness about the perils of climate change (A. O. Scott).</p>
        <p>''DODGEBALL: A TRUE UNDERDOG STORY.'' Starring Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller. Directed and written by Rawson Marshall Thurber. (PG-13, 96 minutes.) Mr. Stiller returns to the comedy crime scene to portray a monstrous, pumped-up fitness guru and hilarious variation of Derek Zoolander, the airheaded male model he played with pursed-lipped, vacant-eyed perfection three years (and many dull movies) ago. His new character, White Goodman, a preening product of fanatical self-improvement, wears a blow-dry mullet and a Fu Manchu mustache and favors hideous white leisure suits. Affecting the pseudo-macho bark of a drill instructor, he suggests Tony Robbins as a shrimpy, steroid-enhanced gym rat. White and his robotic cronies represent the Goliath that Peter La Fleur (Mr. Vaughn), the slobby, nice guy who owns a nearby low-rent gym, sets out to slay with the help of his nerdy pals who form a dodgeball team to compete for $50,000 first prize in a Las Vegas tournament. The sports comedy is very dumb and often very funny (Holden).</p>
        <p>* ''FACING WINDOWS.'' Starring Giovanna Mezzogiorno, Massimo Girotti and Raoul Bova. Directed by Ferzan Ozpetek. (R, 106 minutes; in Italian, with English subtitles.) The lush, surreally flavored immersion in voyeurism and romantic dreams muses on many of the same themes as Alfred Hitchcock's ''Rear Window'' and ''Vertigo,'' but from a more conventional emotional perspective. This seductive Italian film uses the image of beautiful strangers secretly and obsessively studying each other through opposite windows, to reflect on two related romantic syndromes, the ''grass is always greener'' and the ''absence makes the heart grow fonder'' quandaries. Instead of encasing the characters in a Hitchcockian murder mystery, the film compares the fantasies of possible lovers (Ms. Messogiorno and Mr. Bova) to the romantic, six-decade-old memories of a mysterious octogenerian (Mr. Girotti), whose story gradually comes to focus. The movie swept the Italian equivalent of the Oscars in 2003 (Holden).</p>
        <p>''HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN.'' Starring Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson. Directed by Alfonso Cuarón (PG, 136 minutes). Taking over the franchise from Christopher Columbus, Mr. Cuarón injects this third Potter picture with a shadowy, sensual mood. The look is grainier and grimier, and the themes are a bit darker and more unsettling than those in ''The Sorcerer's Stone'' or ''The Chamber of Secrets.'' There is less Quidditch and more Snape (Alan Rickman), which is all to the good, as are the efforts of new cast members like Michael Gambon (taking over for Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore), Emma Thompson (as a batty divination teacher), David Thewlis (as the latest defense-against-the-dark-arts master) and Gary Oldman, who brings his adaptable villainy to the title role. The film's major weakness, sad to say, is Harry himself. Approaching adolescence, Mr. Radcliffe may also be reaching the limit of his range as an actor; he seems unable to summon the complex, volatile emotions that the story demands, with its notes of grief and rage amid the usual boarding-school intrigue. Still, Mr. Cuarón breathes some new life -- and a new sense of mystery -- into a series whose charms are in danger of declining (Scott).</p>
        <p>''THE HUNTING OF THE PRESIDENT.'' Directed by Harry Thomason and Nickolas Perry. (Not rated, 89 minutes.) This documentary takes us back to a simpler time: the late 1990's, when all Americans had to worry about was their President's sexual indiscretions. Mr. Thomason, is, of course, the celebrated friend of Bill Clinton who, as the producer of such Southern-fried situation comedies as ''Designing Women'' and ''Evening Shade,'' was Mr. Clinton's Hollywood connection. As such, he is hardly a dispassionate observer of what his film terms ''the 10-year campaign to destroy Bill Clinton'' on the part of conservative activists, though the film does dutifully scold Mr. Clinton for his infidelities. But mostly the film exists to document the vast, unethical lengths Mr. Clinton's enemies went to in hopes of discrediting him, with testimony from cable news regulars like Jeffrey Toobin, James Carville and Paul Begala, as well as figures, like Susan McDougal, involved in the Whitewater investigations (Kehr).</p>
        <p>''I'LL SLEEP WHEN I'M DEAD.'' Starring Clive Owen, Malcolm McDowell and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. Directed by Mike Hodges. (R, 102 minutes.) Mr. Hodges's new film -- his ninth in 35 years -- has much in common with his first, the legendary ''Get Carter.'' This time, Mr. Owen plays Will, a self-exiled London underworld figure who returns home to avenge the death of his beloved younger brother (Mr. Rhys Meyers), who killed himself after being raped by a prominent citizen (Mr. McDowell). The movie runs more on mood than on plot or psyhology: the motives of the characters are at once too obvious and too obscure, and the storytelling is willfully oblique. But mood is Mr. Hodges's specialty, and few directors create such finely shaded atmospheres of longing, dread and grief. His chilly elegance and Mr. Owen's morose precision are balanced by touches of eccentric humor and by the vulgar warmth of the supporting performers, especially Jamie Foreman as the dead man's best friend, who becomes Will's unlikely sidekick (Scott).</p>
        <p>''SHREK 2,'' with the voices of Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Antonio Banderas and Jennifer Saunders. Directed by Andrew Adamson, Kelly Asbury and Conrad Vernon (PG, 93 minutes). This sequel revives the raucous high spirits of its predecessor, with some new characters, jokes and satiric targets to compensate for the loss of novelty. Shrek (Mr. Myers) and Fiona (Ms. Diaz), now married, travel with Donkey (Mr. Murphy) to meet Shrek's in-laws, the king and queen of Far Far Away, which is to Hollywood what Duloc was to Disney in the first ''Shrek.'' There they contend with a scheming fairy godmother (Ms. Saunders) and a swashbuckling, scene-stealing Puss in Boots (Mr. Banderas). The animation has improved, and the cross-generational appeal -- slapstick and moralizing for the kids, cheekiness and pop music for the grownups -- is precisely calibrated and jauntily executed. Still, the cynicism of the enterprise leaves a bit of a sour taste. The movie is too timid to risk genuine ugliness, and too crude to try for real beauty (Scott).</p>
        <p>''THE STEPFORD WIVES.'' Starring Nicole Kidman and Glenn Close. Directed by Frank Oz. (PG-13, 110 minutes.) Less a remake than a full-scale re-engineering, this adaptation of Ira Levin's dry, efficient suburban gothic turns a dusty 70's thriller into a loud and shiny postmodern farce. The music, by David Arnold, is as dementedly campy as some of the performances, notably Ms. Close's as the robot matriarch of Stepford, Conn. Ms. Kidman plays Joanna Eberhart, a high-powered Manhattan television executive who retreats to Stepford after her career collapses and her marriage (to Matthew Broderick) threatens to do the same. Once there, she discovers that the town's women have all been turned into busty, cheerful automatons who exist to fulfill their husbands' every wish. The screenwriter Paul Rudnick's gags and one-liners are often sly and incisive, but the movie never lives up to its satiric potential, collapsing at the end into incoherence and wishy-washy, have-it-all sentimentality. (Scott).</p>
        <p>''SUPER SIZE ME,'' directed by Morgan Spurlock (not rated, 96 minutes). For 30 days Mr. Spurlock consumed nothing but food from McDonald's, an experiment in bad living that frames a jaunty critique of junk gastronomy and corporate power. Like a thinner, less aggressive Michael Moore, the director talks to consumers, experts and food-industry flacks, weaving alarming statistics about rampant obesity with visits to the doctor and double-quarter-pounder-with-cheese combo meals. The film is an entertaining statement of the obvious, though its big questions -- Do corporations serve our need or enslave our bodies and souls? Are public health problems caused by capitalist rapacity or personal choice? -- are not as simple as Mr. Spurlock would have us believe (Scott).</p>
        <p>* ''THE TERMINAL.'' Starring Tom Hanks. Directed by Steven Spielberg. (PG-13, 128 minutes.) Mr. Hanks plays Viktor Navorski, a traveler from a fictitious Eastern European country who spends a year stranded in the International Arrivals Terminal at Kennedy Airport. What sounds like a nightmare turns out to be a soothing comic dream, thanks to Mr. Spielberg's playful virtuosity, and also to the talents of Mr. Kaminski, who infuses the neutral, unwelcoming architecture of the airport with soft, radiant light. The story is a bit soft: Viktor is befriended by a motley group of airport workers, bedeviled by a Homeland Security apparatchik (Stanley Tucci) and beguiled by an unhappy flight attendant (Catherine Zeta-Jones). There is a bit too much easy sentiment and artificial sweetness, and Ms. Zeta-Jones's character is woefully underwritten. But these flaws cannot dispel the film's deep enchantment. Mr. Hanks, like Mr. Spielberg, has nothing left to prove, and the nuances lurking in his sly, genial performance emerge only in retrospect. Similarly, the movie's deepest engagement with some of the central anxieties of modern life can be found not in its plot but in its ambience. It is a visual tour de force that turns fear into optimism, loneliness into solidarity, and frustration into resourcefulness (Scott).</p>
        <p>''TROY,'' starring Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom. Directed by Wolfgang Petersen (R, 140 minutes). All the talk of glory and immortality is a clear signal that this big, expensive, intermittently campy example of Hollywood Homerism is desperate to be regarded as a classic. It isn't, but it's not so bad either. Yes, the score is dreadful and the dialogue sometimes painfully obvious, but Mr. Petersen and the screenwriter David Benioff take the ancient world and its notions of war seriously. Despite an odd pseudo-English accent (perhaps adopted in deference to the mostly British and Australian cast), Mr. Pitt plays Achilles with wit and charisma, turning the character into a kind of existentialist warrior rock star. Mr. Bana, as Achilles's Trojan counterpart and nemesis, Hector, has a brooding sensitivity that contrasts with Mr. Pitt's brashness. Some of the battle scenes have a vigorous old-time grandeur, and though it takes some inevitable liberties with the source material, the film is more astute about the political and moral complexities of war than most recent combat pictures (Scott).</p>
