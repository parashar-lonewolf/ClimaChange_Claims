        <p>Only now, at the end of the winter season, the English-and French-speaking Canadian residents of Florida are finally getting together. Their numbers are small, and language still separates them, but they gather in places like the Penalty Box Lounge in Fort Lauderdale or in the larger motels along the Sunny Isles oceanfront strip north of Miami to watch hockey games on television from Canada.</p>
        <p>''Except for hockey at playoff time there is little contact made,'' said John Harmon, who writes under the name Jean Laurac in the French-Canadian newspaper Le Soleil de la Floride. ''Like in Canada, we live apart.''</p>
        <p>It is a separatism of little rancor and less controversy at beaches and mobile home parks. Canadians have streamed into Florida for three decades, seeking relief from long winters and a higher cost of living back home.</p>
        <p>A million or more Canadians can be found in Florida in the peak winter season, leaving 24 million or so compatriots behind to deal with the ice and snow. If you ask Canadians here, they will tell you without embarrassment that these figures would be reversed if those staying at home could afford to get down here every year. Haven in the Winter</p>
        <p>More than 300,000 flock here for the entire winter, spending an average of 5.2 months in the Florida sun before returning home to meet the residency requirements that keep them eligible for free national health insurance. The requirements are four consecutive months in Ontario and six in Quebec, the most populous provinces.</p>
        <p>Geography and the slicing angles of interstate highways have conspired to place most French-speaking Quebecers on the lower Atlantic coast of Florida and to channel those from Ontario, west of Quebec, on the Gulf Coast.</p>
        <p>The largest concentration of French-Canadians is anchored here in Hollywood, a community about 20 miles north of Miami where the Canadian maple leaf flag or the blue fleur-de-lis of Quebec can be seen snapping from motel flag poles.</p>
        <p>Elderly men and women who speak few words of English play petanque, a lawn bowling game played with steel balls instead of wooden ones, at mobile home communities like Dale Village. Later, they may eat out in low-priced restaurants like Kerry's Fine Food where they can eat Quebec dishes like a mixture of ham, eggs, beans and sugar. In the evening, if they have access to satellite television from Montreal, they may watch weekly French language soap operas like ''Poivre et Sel,'' or ''Pepper and Salt,'' a comedy about elderly Quebecers like themselves.</p>
        <p>Up the highway in Lake Worth, Evelyn Barron, an English-speaking retiree from Ontario, is indistinguishable from her American contemporaries in her winter activities, except for her twice-monthly luncheons at the Canadian Club of the Palm Beaches, where she joins others in singing ''O Canada.'' Later, at tea time, she savors butter tarts and a hot cup of brewed tea, which she says is unobtainable at most Florida restaurants. Drawn to the West Coast</p>
        <p>On the west coast, in communities like St. Petersburg and Sarasota that draw large numbers of Canadians, when French is heard it is more likely to be spoken by a tourist from France or Switzerland than one from Canada.</p>
        <p>All together, 1.6 million Canadians visit Florida every year, according to a survey by the University of Florida. Thousands of others go to such places as South Carolina, Texas, Arizona, California and Hawaii. Those here from Ontario outnumber French-speaking Quebecers about 2 to 1, with the other provinces contributing relatively few numbers to the total.</p>
        <p>Not all spend their time in Florida under equal circumstances. More affluent Canadians from Ontario or Quebec may own homes or apartments or meet on exclusive golf courses. Quebecers are generally less prosperous, and some who spend winter here may take jobs to help pay their way.</p>
        <p>Despite an unfavorable exchange rate for the Canadian dollar, which has improved recently to 75 cents in United States money, many Canadians on tight budgets find they can get by in Florida because groceries and gasoline are cheaper here than at home and they can escape winter heating costs.</p>
        <p>''For people who don't speak English, there is cultural isolation in Florida,'' said Louise Rioux. From November to May, with her husband, Gerald Edwards, she broadcasts a daily 60-minute radio show in French of Canadian news, sports, interviews and entertainment from their south Florida home. This year they added 10 extra minutes of news in English.</p>
        <p>''The French hang onto the program,'' said Mr. Edwards. ''It is their only means of getting news in Florida unless they receive a Quebec newspaper in the mail or have a television satellite dish.''</p>
        <p>President Reagan's weekend trip to Canada drew notice in broadcasts, including comment on the acid rain problem that threatens Canada's forests. But the highlight of each broadcast, Ms. Rioux said, one that makes listeners call for silence in their mobile homes or condominiums, is the weather reports from back home.</p>
        <p>On Monday they were uniform for eastern Canada, cold, cloudy and rainy, reports that produced exclamations of pleasure in two languages across the Sunshine State.</p>
