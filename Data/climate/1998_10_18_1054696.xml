        <p>And Bear in Mind  (Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>THE AMERICAN CENTURY, by Harold Evans with Gail Buckland and Kevin Baker. (Knopf, $50.)

        <p>DANCING NAKED IN THE MIND FIELD, by Kary Mullis. (Pantheon, $24.) The darkly joyous autobiography of a brilliant chemist (Nobel Prize, 1993) whose views on global warming, H.I.V., the ozone layer and many other issues are either unusual or bizarre (maybe time will tell).</p>
        <p>EUCALYPTUS, by Murray Bail. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $23.) A magic novel from Australia, in which a homesteader's daughter must marry, fairy tale fashion, the first suitor who can correctly identify every eucalyptus species; a wandering storyteller breaks the rule.</p>
        <p>EVENING, by Susan Minot. (Knopf, $23.) An elegant, assured novel that tells the story of a woman's life in two narratives: one as she remembers her life, one as she passes from it.</p>
        <p>THE EVOLUTION OF JANE, by Cathleen Schine. (Houghton Mifflin, $24.) A character named Jane and the principles of evolution are both shrewdly rendered in a novel that unconventionally uses large principles to illuminate a particular life.</p>
        <p>THE FARMING OF BONES, by Edwidge Danticat. (Soho, $23.) A sobering novel by a Haitian-American, set in Hispaniola in 1937 during a bloody eruption of the endless hostility between Haiti and its neighbor, the Dominican Republic.</p>
        <p>THE GIANT, O'BRIEN, by Hilary Mantel. (Marian Wood/Holt, $22.) An early mad scientist meets a late, unviable, enormous Irish spinner of tales in a novel that grants the future to the scientist but the heart to the bard.</p>
        <p>I MARRIED A COMMUNIST, by Philip Roth. (Houghton Mifflin, $26.) A tender, harsh, witty novel whose title refers to a bitter, hostile book written by the female half of a ruined marriage (sound familiar?), and whose principal action, recalled in the present, takes place in the dire focus of the age of McCarthyism.</p>
        <p>LOVE UNDETECTABLE: Notes on Friendship, Sex, and Survival, by Andrew Sullivan. (Knopf, $23.) A meditation, basically religious, on the effects of AIDS in the culture and in individuals, by the former editor of The New Republic.</p>
        <p>THE VENTRILOQUIST'S TALE, by Pauline Melville. (Bloomsbury USA/St. Martin's, $23.95.) A gleeful fiction that plays the spirit-filled world of South American Indians against the rationalist world of exploitative, ''civilizing'' Europeans in a novel that is in part an act of revenge on Evelyn Waugh for his 1934 novel, ''A Handful of Dust.''</p>

        <p>And Bear in Mind  (Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>THE AMERICAN CENTURY, by Harold Evans with Gail Buckland and Kevin Baker. (Knopf, $50.) An accessible political history, elegantly and copiously illustrated; it argues that American democratic ideals, however many times they have led to grief for ourselves and others, on balance have made for human rights, here and abroad.</p>
        <p>DANCING NAKED IN THE MIND FIELD, by Kary Mullis. (Pantheon, $24.) The darkly joyous autobiography of a brilliant chemist (Nobel Prize, 1993) whose views on global warming, H.I.V., the ozone layer and many other issues are either unusual or bizarre (maybe time will tell).</p>
        <p>EUCALYPTUS, by Murray Bail. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $23.) A magic novel from Australia, in which a homesteader's daughter must marry, fairy tale fashion, the first suitor who can correctly identify every eucalyptus species; a wandering storyteller breaks the rule.</p>
        <p>EVENING, by Susan Minot. (Knopf, $23.) An elegant, assured novel that tells the story of a woman's life in two narratives: one as she remembers her life, one as she passes from it.</p>
        <p>THE EVOLUTION OF JANE, by Cathleen Schine. (Houghton Mifflin, $24.) A character named Jane and the principles of evolution are both shrewdly rendered in a novel that unconventionally uses large principles to illuminate a particular life.</p>
        <p>THE FARMING OF BONES, by Edwidge Danticat. (Soho, $23.) A sobering novel by a Haitian-American, set in Hispaniola in 1937 during a bloody eruption of the endless hostility between Haiti and its neighbor, the Dominican Republic.</p>
        <p>THE GIANT, O'BRIEN, by Hilary Mantel. (Marian Wood/Holt, $22.) An early mad scientist meets a late, unviable, enormous Irish spinner of tales in a novel that grants the future to the scientist but the heart to the bard.</p>
        <p>I MARRIED A COMMUNIST, by Philip Roth. (Houghton Mifflin, $26.) A tender, harsh, witty novel whose title refers to a bitter, hostile book written by the female half of a ruined marriage (sound familiar?), and whose principal action, recalled in the present, takes place in the dire focus of the age of McCarthyism.</p>
        <p>LOVE UNDETECTABLE: Notes on Friendship, Sex, and Survival, by Andrew Sullivan. (Knopf, $23.) A meditation, basically religious, on the effects of AIDS in the culture and in individuals, by the former editor of The New Republic.</p>
        <p>THE VENTRILOQUIST'S TALE, by Pauline Melville. (Bloomsbury USA/St. Martin's, $23.95.) A gleeful fiction that plays the spirit-filled world of South American Indians against the rationalist world of exploitative, ''civilizing'' Europeans in a novel that is in part an act of revenge on Evelyn Waugh for his 1934 novel, ''A Handful of Dust.''</p>
