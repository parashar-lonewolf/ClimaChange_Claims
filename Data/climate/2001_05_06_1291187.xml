        <p>People looking for the purest, healthiest and maybe the tastiest water need look no further than their kitchen faucet, the world's largest environmental group says.</p>
        <p>In many cases the only difference between expensive bottled water and tap water is the container, the World Wide Fund for Nature said this week. ''Bottled water may be no safer or healthier than tap water in many countries while it sells for up to 1,000 times the price,'' the Swiss-based conservation group reported.</p>
        <p>Turning on the tap would help not only one's wallet but also the environment, it added, because 1.5 million tons of plastic are used each year to bottle water, said Dr. Biksham Gujja, head of WWF International's Fresh Water Program.</p>
        <p>And toxic chemicals released during the manufacture and disposal of bottles can release gases that contribute to climate change, the group said, releasing a University of Geneva study.</p>
        <p>Over the long term, Dr. Gujja said, the increasing popularity of bottled water threatens to erode regulatory standards for tap water. But for now tap water standards in Europe and the United States are higher than those governing bottled water, the study found.</p>
        <p>''In fact, there are more standards regulating tap water in Europe and the United States than those applied to the bottled water industry,'' said WWF International, known as World Wildlife Fund in the United States.</p>
        <p>Some bottled water, Dr. Gujja added, is simply tap water, but in a fancy container.</p>
        <p>The $22 billion-a-year bottled water industry was quick to respond.  ''If municipal water is used as a source for bottled water, it typically undergoes additional processing and purification for quality, safety and taste,'' Stephen Kay of the International Bottled Water Association, based in Alexandria, Va., said in a telephone interview.</p>
        <p>He added that the industry and governments are preparing to adopt worldwide standards this summer to assure uniform quality.</p>
        <p>Still, bottled water is so popular that there are more than 700 brands of water produced worldwide. The champion bottled water drinkers are Western Europeans, who consume nearly half of the product.</p>
