        <p>LEAD: Dr. Victor Zakkay of New York University is an internationally known researcher of pressurized fluidized bed combustion, a new coal-burning technology that many feel may be the cleanest, most economical way for utilities to produce electricity in this country in the next 20 years. His pilot plant here is the largest in the nation burning coal using this method.</p>
        <p>Dr. Victor Zakkay of New York University is an internationally known researcher of pressurized fluidized bed combustion, a new coal-burning technology that many feel may be the cleanest, most economical way for utilities to produce electricity in this country in the next 20 years. His pilot plant here is the largest in the nation burning coal using this method.</p>
        <p>The Department of Energy finances Dr. Zakkay. ''Important?'' said Steve Bossart of the department. ''Oh yeah.''</p>
        <p>Researchers from Europe constantly consult with Dr. Zakkay. The American Electric Power Company, one of the nation's largest utilities, is building a new plant in Ohio that will use this technology and hopes to convert a second plant to this method. ''Is Dr. Zakkay's work important?'' said Michael Mudd of American Electric. ''Very, very.'' Sweden and Spain also have these plants under way.</p>
        <p>Just a 15-minute drive from Dr. Zakkay is the Long Island Lighting Company. For a decade he has been trying to get someone at Lilco interested in his work. He has long believed Lilco's $5.3 billion Shoreham nuclear plant could be converted to this coal method. ''I call Lilco,'' he said, ''No interest at all! I say, 'Please come and look at our plant, it's beautiful, beautiful.' Nothing.'' He hopes that now, after Lilco's negotiations with the state have virtually guaranteed Shoreham will never operate as a nuclear plant, someone will listen.</p>
        <p>Dr. Zakkay's idea of a great vacation is taking his wife on a tour of the new coal plants of Europe. When his plant here runs tests, he stays all night, sleeping on a mattress on the floor. ''Victor's very conscientious,'' Mr. Bossart said.</p>
        <p>To Dr. Zakkay, the answer seems clear. The United States has one of the world's largest coal supplies. Indeed, 56 percent of its electric power is generated by coal. Because of the fragile nature of oil imports and disillusionment with nuclear power, he believes coal is our best bet for now.</p>
        <p>In conventional plants, coal is burned at a high temperature, turning pipes full of water into steam that drives a turbine. However, combustion byproducts, sulfur and nitrogen dioxides, escape out the stack, polluting the environment, leading to acid rain.</p>
        <p>In a pressurized fluidized system, the water pipes are heated by a bed of coal mixed with limestone, burning at half the conventional temperature. The system cuts sulfur emissions by up to 90 percent and nitrogen dioxide by 75 percent. This process is done under high pressure and, instead of letting the gas byproducts escape out a stack, the gas is used to drive a second turbine.</p>
        <p>Studies show the pressurized method is 10 percent more energy-efficient than current coal technology. It also generates 15 percent less ash and sludge waste than plants using wet scrubbers to clean emissions. And unlike waste from a nuclear plant, which stays dangerous hundreds of years, ash can be safely put in existing landfills.</p>
        <p>Lilco officials say they have not responded to Dr. Zakkay because until the recent negotiations for a state takeover of Shoreham, they were determined to have a nuclear station.</p>
        <p>Dr. Zakkay points out that other plants intended to be nuclear have changed to coal. In 1983, with the Zimmer (Ohio) nuclear plant 97 percent done, its parent companies halted construction. They estimated it would take $1.7 billion to finish and because of political uncertainties there was no guarantee of a license. They discovered that, for $1.7 billion, they could convert Zimmer to coal with 50 percent more power capacity than the nuclear plant would have had. Conversion is under way.</p>
        <p>In the early 1980's, during the oil crisis, New England Electric converted its two biggest plants from oil to mainly coal. Glenn Schleede, a vice president, says that if a plant is situated on water, as Shoreham is, coal can be feasible for an Eastern utility. New England Electric now has its own coal ship that transports Appalachian coal from East Coast ports. He says that pollution has been less with coal than it was with oil and that switching to coal has saved the utility $310 million.</p>
        <p>In 1979, after Three Mile Island, the Suffolk County Legislature pressed Lilco to study the economic feasiblity of converting Shoreham to coal. That study is now clearly outdated. It assumed that as a nuclear plant, Shoreham would be ready to open in 1982 at a $1.6 billion cost - about five years and nearly $4 billion off. It concluded coal conversion would be too expensive, driving Shoreham's total cost to $2.3 billion. And worst of all, the 1979 study said, a coal plant would not be set to open until January 1988.</p>
        <p>Dr. Zakkay thinks it's time for a new study, by the state. Last week, before leaving on a tour of Europe's power plants, he wrote Governor Cuomo to this effect.</p>
