        <p>LEAD: A HANDOUT LISTING THE RULES for the 27 actors and musicians in the cast of ''Swing,'' Elizabeth Swados's new musical, decreed the following:</p>
        <p>A HANDOUT LISTING THE RULES for the 27 actors and musicians in the cast of ''Swing,'' Elizabeth Swados's new musical, decreed the following:</p>
        <p>* Four times more than 10 minutes late - fired.</p>
        <p>* Two no-shows - no calling in -fired.</p>
        <p>* No moods, attitudes, talking back or school-type disciplinary behavior. If you are in ''Swing'' it is because you want to work.</p>
        <p>* We will not be overly friendly to parents or teachers or managers.</p>
        <p>They didn't audition, they can't act, play or sing and it's not their gig.</p>
        <p>* Physical injury or death is forbidden.</p>
        <p>* Feel free to write music, choreograph or make up scenes.</p>
        <p>* Appreciate small steps forward, don't laugh at each other, and realize that criticism from Liz is to make the machine work better.</p>
        <p>She's not a swami and doesn't have a clue how to make you a better person or provide you with eternal bliss.</p>
        <p>Strange doings at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. A tiny boy in a Mets cap is teetering on top of a broken television set. Two ballroom dancers - he in black suspenders, she in pink stretch pants and black patent leather shoes - dreamily dance the Peabody while a menacing-looking 16-year-old lurks behind them holding an imaginary knife. The air is thick with hormones and adrenaline.</p>
        <p>''Swing,'' which has been crafted over the last year and a half by Liz Swados and some 27 kids, almost all from New York City, is the most recent undertaking of the writer-composer-director. The work is almost impossible to define or categorize; it is not a musical in the traditional sense, but an impressionistic blend of dance, drama and music in collage-like bursts. There is exuberant Duke Ellington-style swing, Chicago-inspired blues, Elvis Presley be-bop, dance styles like the Mess-Around and the Lindy and a contemporary dream sequence - a Reebok version of ''The Red Shoes.''</p>
        <p>The show, which is to open Saturday at the Brooklyn Academy of Music as part of the Next Wave Festival, is the evolutionary product of an intense, sometimes tumultuous collaboration by Ms. Swados and her young cast members Like the subway ride depicted in ''G Train to Nowhere,'' a song composed by David Levitt, a 17-year-old trombone player, the production has had its share of bumps, halts and lurches as well as wondrous stretches of euphoria.</p>
        <p>''For me, working with kids has always represented the hardest thing there is,'' said Ms. Swados at a recent reheasal, surrounded by empty Cheetos bags, copies of Creem magazine and other artifacts of youth culture. ''The energy is so raw and the potential so enormous.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Swados, a spitfire in the tradition of Annie Oakley with equal parts of Raggedy Ann and Susan Sontag, first mined the hopes, fears and aspirations of children in the 1978 musical ''Runaways,'' which collected five Tony nominations. Her other credits include ''Rap Master Ronnie,'' a musical satire created in collaboration with Garry Trudeau; ''Jerusalem,'' an opera-oratorio; the conception of several television programs, including an adaptation of Blake's ''Songs of Innocence and Experience,'' and scores for numerous television and feature films. She is also the author of a novel, ''Leah and Lazar,'' as well as three children's books. Her new book, ''On Becoming a Composer,'' will be published next fall by Harper &amp; Row.</p>
        <p>To its creator, ''Swing'' most resembles ''a 1930's musical gone berserk. I was looking for a 'Pennies From Heaven' feeling in the middle of the worst despair,'' she said. In ''Swing,'' which Ms. Swados refers to as ''concert with theater,'' a romanticism of the past is juxtaposed with some disturbing images from the present: welfare hotels, teen-age pregnancy, bread lines, drug addiction and most of all, the breakup of the nuclear family. The swing refers to ''swings of fate, swings of mood, swings of luck, and swings of fashion'' in addition to the music.</p>
        <p>Weaving her own compositions together with movements, body language, dramatic improvisations and music by the kids themselves, Ms. Swados attempts to present a richly textured metaphor for a confused, crazy world that too often leaves young people alone, accompanied by just their longings. Her lyrics cast a net over this generational loneliness: ''Why don't nobody like me? Nobody need me? Why ain't nobody mine?''</p>
        <p>Though ''Swing'' is not confessional theater in the manner of ''Runaways,'' which used first-person narrative to tell the stories of teen-agers in crisis, many of its images have been drawn from workshops in which the cast members dramatized their own observations about urban life. Slowly and subtly, their lives have shaped this work just as the work has transformed them.</p>
        <p>To recruit her cast, Ms. Swados combed community centers such as El Puente in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, high school jazz bands, the Louise Brooks Caribbean Dance Company and other grass-roots performing arts groups. A few were found at the Greenwich, Conn., high school and the LaGuardia High School of Music and the Performing Arts. One cast member was discovered at an audition held for children living at the Brooklyn Arms, the welfare hotel across the street from the Brooklyn Academy.</p>
        <p>''I was looking for kids who were loners, who had secret dreams,'' Ms. Swados said. ''Kids who obsessed. Kids who were going through the lonely effort to achieve a communication with themselves and others through dance, music and composition.''</p>
        <p>On more than one occasion, their matter-of-fact attitude toward current events - a world in which Bernhard Goetz, the garbage barge, welfare hotels, harmonic convergence, swamis in Rolls-Royces and tabloid headlines such as ''Escalator Swallows Mom'' are everyday occurrences - infuriated their director. Trying to understand them, Ms. Swados said, made her feel ''like a wimpy liberal impaled on the V of her own peace symbol.</p>
        <p>''These kids have grown up with much less sympathy for the problems of their generation,'' she said. ''They are amazingly gifted, but their hearts have been ripped out.''</p>
        <p>At times, the production has been fraught with its own drama. The day before call-backs at the Brooklyn Arms, for instance, four small children died in a fire at the hotel. One cast member was lost to the group because her father, a drug addict, had taken her earnings from the show and fled the country, and she and her mother moved away.</p>
        <p>The rehearsals have also been punctuated with kids being kids - the trombone player, for instance, jabbing the girl saxophonist in front of him with his slide.</p>
        <p>Cast members have persevered despite long hours and tough schedules. Twelve-year-old Ashanti Isabell, for instance, commutes from Trenton, where she lives with her grandmother in a public housing project. After going to school in the morning, she catches a train with her aunt to New York, puts in a full afternoon of rehearsal and gets back to Trenton at 10 P.M., where she finishes her homework - admittedly ''in bed.''</p>
        <p>''At first I wanted to be a dancer, but this show has changed my mind,'' she said. ''I like acting better. You can act funny, sad, crazy or sloppy. You never run out of things to act about.''</p>
        <p>For the cast, there has been the formidable challenge of assimilating this free-form way of working. ''People ask, well. . .what part do you play? I tell them I don't have one,'' said 18-year-old Connie Alexander, a Hunter College freshman who dances the lead in Ms. Swados's version of ''The Red Shoes.''</p>
        <p>''At first I thought 'Swing' was abstract,'' said Julissa Marquez, an 18-year-old dancer who came to Ms. Swados via El Puente. ''Then over time things began to fit in.''</p>
        <p>The 10 songs Ms. Swados has written for ''Swing'' have evolved from ''hanging around them all the time.'' (''Don't you come inside my head,'' pleads one Kurt Weillian number.) Added to Ms. Swados's own music are songs and arrangements composed by 18-year-old Preston Fulwood Jr. and other members of the ''Swing'' band.</p>
        <p>''What I like about it is that you can make your own music,'' observed Elizabeth Grad, a tuba player from Bayside, Queens. ''There's no script, so you're free to use your own imagination. There are no boundaries, except for how much you can move your lips and fingers.''</p>
        <p>Elizabeth Grad holds down two other jobs, as a church receptionist and a newspaper delivery girl. For her and others, finding like-minded peers has been something of a revelation. As she put it: ''There are people here who can really play.''</p>
        <p>Ideas for stories come from the young people, too. Seventeen-year-old flutist Belinda Lee Lucatorto from Staten Island wanted Ms. Swados to include a bit about teen-age pregnancy. ''I know a lot of girls in my school who are pregnant and the guy isn't with them anymore and it seems really crazy to me. They don't realize it's an 18-year job at least,'' she explained.</p>
        <p>Ms. Swados asked Belinda to come up with an improvisation about a pregnant teen-ager that somehow used newspaper as a prop. Belinda went off by herself for a while, then showed Ms. Swados a pregnant belly and an infant made out of newspaper. She demonstrates how a young pregnant girl might feel about the cuddled-up piece of newspaper. ''It's really good,'' Ms. Swados told Belinda. ''We'll find a place for it.''</p>
        <p>Another day, the mood was somber. Members of the cast had performed a couple of numbers over the weekend, and it didn't go well. Invisible storm clouds gathered as the cast assembled in a circle around Ms. Swados. ''When you're onstage it looks as though you're there because I told you to do it,'' she yelled, trying to penetrate their ''sound barriers,'' as she put it. ''What's missing is your wish to do this. Why are you here? If you have something that brought you here, give it!!!!''</p>
        <p>After a break, during which 12-year-old Frank Kero rode his skateboard while other cast members dashed out for egg rolls, they performed a run-through.</p>
        <p>They rehearsed a bluesy number called ''12 Rough Years,'' a tune inspired by the Chicago blues performed with sunglasses. ''It's our costume number,'' Ms. Swados said. She then called for an ''emergency workshop'' to come up with a dramatic interlude that would show something nasty happening to the cast member Albert Delatorre III. They created blind Albert. Cold Albert. Albert in a cast made out of newspaper that was then brutally stripped away.</p>
        <p>Ms. Swados decided to use none of these and instead opted for a cardboard box to be placed over Ashanti Isabell's head. That day's rehearsal was humbling.</p>
        <p>''I think Liz is a psychological genius,'' observed 19-year-old percussion player Amit Shamir, a bit chastened but inspired by the rigorous session.</p>
        <p>The next day, however, the cast was ''hooked in.'' ''Work the muscles of your emotions,'' Ms. Swados told them as they gathered in their circle. ''This is the most exciting step: taking a risk. If you don't take the risk, you're never gonna get there.''</p>
        <p>To Ms. Swados, ''Swing'' is ''very much about survival, about holding on. The world they have grown up in seems incredibly anxious, overwhelming, corrupt, contradictory. They've grown up from Day One with liars as leaders, so the world is like slapstick. What keeps coming back is the joke of it all.''</p>
        <p>The production was prompted in part because she was ''furious about the exploitation of youthful problems - topics like 'children whose mothers are trying to have a career while dealing with taking a gay dog to the vet.' ''</p>
        <p>''I'm not Mother Teresa,'' she insisted, ''but I'm interested. I wanted to penetrate their sound barriers. . . get them to release the imaginative parts of their brains. These kids are not living in a world where they think everything is going to be O.K. It's very important that we take a direct interest in children again.''</p>
        <p>Though some of the young people seemed baffled by the social consciousness of this former hippie in cut-off sweatpants, it's clear the experience has taught them much about themselves.</p>
        <p>''I find it easier to write now. I found a spark that's set off something,'' said Andrew Julian Meyers, a 17-year-old saxophonist.</p>
        <p>''It's taught me to keep going and trust myself,'' said Preston Fulwood Jr. Admitted 13-year-old Harry Thompson III, ''It's taught me that I'm not as good as I thought I was.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Swados is feeling more even-keeled now than during her ''Runaways'' era, when she was a self-described ''self-absorbed Bennington girl who wore black turtlenecks and was unable to crack a smile.'' ''I'm less selfish. I'm not working out my problems on the stage. Ten years ago I had the brashness to think I knew everything. In doing 'Swing,' I made room for these kids at every turn.''</p>
        <p>For Elizabeth Swados, working with a voluble group of young people in blue jeans and braces represents both a return and a departure. A year ago, they were ''unfocused, with spurts of extraordinary talent and energy - total dissipation into the ozone layer.'' As is her style, ''Swing'' will be in a perpetual state of creation practically until curtain time. ''For my own nourishment,'' she said, ''I needed to go out on a cliff and feel that wonderful terror again.''  THEATER</p>
