        <p>John Sununu's resignation as White House chief of staff may swiftly improve President Bush's image and tattered relations with Congress. It could even help his urgent effort to be seen as more sensitive to domestic needs. But if he wishes now to be understood as changing policy, he'll have to do more than change his chief of staff.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sununu's departure cannot alter one unalterable fact: George Bush is the President, and Mr. Sununu was</p>
        <p>his</p>
        <p>man. Indeed, Mr. Bush chose Mr. Sununu in a conscious effort to assert his independence from his campaign handlers, notably James Baker, whom he named Secretary of State. "There will be no deputy President," he told friends shortly after the 1988 election. So he chose John Sununu -- his choice, and his alone.</p>

        <p>John Sununu's resignation as White House chief of staff may swiftly improve President Bush's image and tattered relations with Congress. It could even help his urgent effort to be seen as more sensitive to domestic needs. But if he wishes now to be understood as changing policy, he'll have to do more than change his chief of staff.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sununu's departure cannot alter one unalterable fact: George Bush is the President, and Mr. Sununu was</p>
        <p>his</p>
        <p>man. Indeed, Mr. Bush chose Mr. Sununu in a conscious effort to assert his independence from his campaign handlers, notably James Baker, whom he named Secretary of State. "There will be no deputy President," he told friends shortly after the 1988 election. So he chose John Sununu -- his choice, and his alone.</p>
        <p>It was not in many respects a felicitous one. Mr. Sununu's combative political style, though it surely jump-started Mr. Bush's flagging campaign in the 1988 New Hampshire primary, did not serve him well in Washington. The capital prizes tact and the art of compromise. Mr. Sununu, by turns arrogant and abrasive, often played the bully.</p>
        <p>Like other chiefs of staff before him, Mr. Sununu greatly enjoyed the vast power that accompanied his role. But he also abused it. His skiing trips and the flight to Boston to see his dentist, all aboard military aircraft, the trip by Government limousine to New York to buy rare stamps -- all not only embarrassed the President but suggested confusion of temporary authority with personal importance.</p>
        <p>On policy matters he sought to defend and cultivate Mr. Bush's right flank, presumably on the President's direct instructions. He often did so with an intolerance for competing ideas that angered senior officials. Mr. Bush pledged, for example, to be "the environment President." Yet Mr. Sununu has routinely blocked policy suggestions that could have given the U.S. and the President a leadership position on questions of global concern, like the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, in terms of direct politics, he contributed mightily to Mr. Bush's successful efforts to slice and dice the Democrats. Mr. Sununu positively chortled at the idea that the President's main education initiative -- a program of vouchers -- would divide two big Democratic constituencies, blacks and Catholics. And he repeatedly tried to undermine Republican moderates working for compromise on civil rights.</p>
        <p>But throughout, Mr. Sununu has been doing just what his President wanted. Mr. Bush may now choose a kinder, gentler Sununu but that alone will do little to achieve a kinder, gentler society.</p>
