        <p>THE JESUS MACHINE</p>
        <p>How James Dobson, Focus on the Family,</p>
        <p>and Evangelical America Are Winning</p>
        <p>the Culture War.</p>
        <p>By Dan Gilgoff.</p>
        <p>315 pp. St. Martin's Press. $25.95.</p>
        <p>James DOBSON is the Christian right's most powerful leader. While the Moral Majority and the Christian Coalition have crumbled, Dobson's organization, Focus on the Family, has prospered. His multimillion-dollar-a-year media empire includes a daily radio show, with him as the host, that reaches millions of listeners, as well as a rapid-response telephone and letter-writing operation.</p>
        <p>This empire is based at an 88-acre campus in Colorado Springs, with some 1,300 employees and a 75,000-square-foot warehouse filled with DVDs, CDs, pamphlets and books that disseminate Dobson's advice on matters like how to stop bed-wetting or confront a teenager about drug use, not to mention admonitions against gay rights and judicial activism. And while other leaders of the religious right, like Ralph Reed and Ted Haggard, have been tainted by scandal, Dobson's own family exemplifies his gospel: his daughter, Danae, has displayed remarkable literary fecundity, producing more than 20 books aimed at Christian children; his son, Ryan, who leads a skateboarding ministry, is a co-author of ''Be Intolerant,'' a broadside against moral relativism written for young adults.</p>
        <p>In ''The Jesus Machine: How James Dobson, Focus on the Family, and Evangelical America Are Winning the Culture War,'' Dan Gilgoff, a senior editor at U.S. News &amp; World Report, chronicles Dobson's extraordinary rise. In 2004, Gilgoff made his first trip to the headquarters of Focus on the Family, where he met with numerous staff members and moseyed around the campus for several days before finally landing a rare interview with Dobson himself. Dobson, who apparently distrusts any media he doesn't control, hit it off with Gilgoff, but the author's unusual access ended abruptly a year ago when Dobson and his associates learned the title of this book. They need hardly have worried. An astute observer, Gilgoff presents his material in a dispassionate fashion, although he might have attempted to draw broader conclusions from it.</p>
        <p>According to Gilgoff, Dobson's ancestors were charter members of the Church of the Nazarene, a small Christian denomination established at the outset of the 20th century. For almost two decades, however, Dobson, who was born in 1936, focused on a career as a medical researcher and as a professor of pediatrics at the University of Southern California School of Medicine. Then the 1960s arrived, and Dobson was radicalized. In 1970, he wrote ''Dare to Discipline,'' a countermanifesto to the child-rearing techniques espoused by Benjamin Spock; it defended, among other things, spanking with a belt or a switch. A 1981 one-hour television special called ''Where's Dad?'' made Dobson a household name among evangelicals.</p>
        <p>The radio show took off in the early '80s. ''Dobson's avuncular manner,'' Gilgoff writes, ''and his capacity for letting grown men break down with the tape rolling were a sharp break with Christian radio's customary fire-and-brimstone sermons.'' While Dobson did not shrink from pronouncing uncompromising judgments about topics like premarital sex, he also stressed that it was never too late to achieve redemption by reversing course and becoming a ''secondary virgin.''</p>
        <p>Despite the growth of evangelicalism, however, the movement seemed to reap few political rewards. Ronald Reagan, Gilgoff notes, ''appointed almost no evangelicals to top administration posts.'' Instead of tackling hot-button social issues, Reagan made sweeping tax cuts his priority. George H. W. Bush was even less well disposed toward the Christian right.</p>
        <p>As a result, religious conservatives entered the political fray more directly. In 1983, Dobson helped found the Family Research Council, which has become the most influential lobbying group of the Christian right. In 1988, he began creating state-level groups called Family Policy Councils to lobby state lawmakers for ''pro-family'' legislation. Since then, as Gilgoff writes, Dobson has become progressively more enmeshed in national politics. Gilgoff observes that in 2004 Dobson played a crucial role in prompting President Bush to endorse the Federal Marriage Amendment and in getting a state constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage on the ballot in Ohio. In addition, Dobson -- in contrast to 2000, when evangelicals were left cold by Bush's espousal of compassionate conservatism -- exhorted his followers to vote.</p>
        <p>Small wonder that Dobson later spoke of conferring with Karl Rove about the abortive nomination of Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court and, moreover, that he received a fawning letter from the newly confirmed justice Samuel Alito thanking him for his support.</p>
        <p>But how much political clout will the religious right continue to wield? Gilgoff seems to suggest that its institutional structure will allow it to remain a powerful force. He points out that the Christian right has begun to seek better coordination by creating the Arlington Group, a secretive society of top leaders that meets regularly to discuss strategy. But as Gilgoff also says in his rather perfunctory conclusion, the religious right remains bedeviled by factional disputes, to the extent that Dobson admonished Richard Cizik, the chief lobbyist for the National Association of Evangelicals, for drafting and circulating a petition demanding that the Bush administration address global warming. And Gilgoff might have made more of the Terri Schiavo case, which badly damaged Bush and helped cost the Republicans control of Congress. Despite this book's striking subtitle, the culture war seems to be petering out, with the religious right far from victory. It may now be demonstrating not the exertions of a virile new political species, but the thrashings of a dinosaur that can do a lot of damage even in its final throes.</p>
