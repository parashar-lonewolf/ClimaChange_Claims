        <p>President Bush on Monday promoted his plan to reduce American dependence on foreign oil by using alternative energy sources, but he did not repeat a promise to cut back on Middle East oil imports that drew complaints from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and was disavowed by his energy secretary.</p>
        <p>Instead, on a day when oil prices rose to more than $60 a barrel because of militant attacks on oil suppliers in the Niger Delta, Mr. Bush toned down his implicit criticism of countries in the Persian Gulf and spoke of American reliance on foreign oil in more general terms.</p>
        <p>''Some of the nations we rely on for oil have unstable governments, or fundamental differences with the United States,'' Mr. Bush said in a speech in Milwaukee, his first stop of the day. ''These countries know we need their oil, and that reduces influence. It creates a national security issue when we're held hostage for energy by foreign nations that may not like us.''</p>
        <p>As alternatives to oil, Mr. Bush promoted battery-powered cars at the stop in Wisconsin and solar power at a later stop in Michigan. He ended the day in Colorado, where some three dozen workers at the federal National Renewable Energy Laboratory were rehired after being laid off soon after Mr. Bush's State of the Union address promoting renewable energy.</p>
        <p>A statement released Monday by the Energy Department said that Samuel W. Bodman, the energy secretary, ordered the transfer of $5 million over the weekend to immediately restore the jobs, which had been eliminated because of past budget cuts, thereby avoiding a political embarrassment for the president. Mr. Bush is to visit the laboratory, in Golden, Colo., on Tuesday morning.</p>
        <p>The programs at the energy laboratory, Mr. Bodman said in a statement, ''are critically important to realizing the president's vision to diversify and strengthen our nation's energy mix.''</p>
        <p>Both Republicans and Democrats commend Mr. Bush for endorsing alternative sources of energy, but Republicans question the practicality of relying on them and Democrats say that a more significant way of reducing reliance on foreign oil is imposing higher fuel-efficiency standards on cars, which Mr. Bush opposes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's trip to promote his energy proposals, first put forth in his State of the Union address on Jan. 31, dovetailed with his campaign travels. Wisconsin, Michigan and Colorado have races important to the White House this year, but of particular concern is Colorado, where a recent poll shows a Republican candidate for governor, Representative Bob Beauprez, trailing Bill Ritter, a Democrat and former Denver district attorney.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Bush did no overt politicking in the three states, the view of the White House is that his appearances are helpful to Republican candidates because they motivate the party's most faithful supporters.</p>
        <p>In Milwaukee, Mr. Bush toured a technology center of Johnson Controls, the world's largest supplier of standard car batteries and a leader in research into new lithium ion batteries for hybrid cars. Afterward, in a speech to Johnson Controls employees, Mr. Bush urged Congress to support an additional $31 million for research into the new batteries, as called for in his 2007 budget.</p>
        <p>Lithium ion batteries are smaller and more efficient than the current nickel metal hydride batteries used in hybrid cars, although they are still years away from widespread use.</p>
        <p>''You've got your car, you pull in, you plug it right into the wall,'' Mr. Bush said, adding that he anticipated a day when cars with lithium ion batteries could go 40 miles on electricity alone. Current hybrid cars use the gasoline engine to charge the onboard battery.</p>
        <p>In Auburn Hills, Mich., Mr. Bush toured United Solar Ovonic, a maker of solar panels. ''The ultimate goal is to have solar technology on your home, and that home will become a little power-generating unit unto itself,'' Mr. Bush told reporters afterward.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush proposed in his State of the Union address that the United States replace 75 percent of oil imports from the Middle East with alternative sources of energy by 2025. The next day, Mr. Bodman said that the president should not be taken literally and that the Middle East goal was ''merely an example'' of what might be done.</p>
