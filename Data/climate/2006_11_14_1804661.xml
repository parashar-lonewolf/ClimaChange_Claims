        <p>The Moon Sighs</p>
        <p>The moon, planetary scientists will tell you, is deader than a door nail. Sure, there is a constant stream of small moonquakes, but volcanically speaking the moon stopped being active more than 3 billion years ago. Since then it's been pretty much dead on the inside.</p>
        <p>Maybe not totally, according to research by Peter H. Schultz of Brown University and colleagues. In the current issue of Nature, they describe a lunar feature that they say shows signs of a relatively recent release of gas from deep beneath the surface.</p>
        <p>The feature is the Ina structure, a 200-foot-deep depression in the surface that looks as if it was created by the heel of a shoe (one that was about 5 miles long). It was first photographed by orbiting Apollo astronauts, and because of its location on the summit of a dome, it was thought to be the caldera of one of the dead volcanoes that pepper the moon.</p>
        <p>But the researchers analyzed several characteristics of the Ina structure and concluded that it is probably less than 10 million years old. For one thing, there are relatively few impact craters from meteors. If the structure formed more than 3 billion years ago, there would be a lot more. For another, the spectral signature of the soil in the area indicates that it is ''fresh,'' having been exposed to weathering fairly recently.</p>
        <p>The researchers suggest that the structure was created by periodic outgassing (of carbon dioxide, perhaps, or even water vapor) from within the moon, which would have blown the top off the surface in this region.</p>
        <p>While it's a far cry from a volcano, such last-gasp activity shows that there may be a little life in the old moon yet.</p>
        <p>New Oil Skimmer</p>
        <p>Among the most common equipment used to clean up after a marine oil spill is the oil skimmer. It is a very basic device, consisting of a rotating drum, belt or disk that constantly picks up the oil from the surface of the water. The oil is then removed by a scraper or roller.</p>
        <p>But it's not a very efficient device. The flat surface of a drum cannot pick up much oil, and brush-like surfaces, which increase the collecting area, are difficult to scrape clean, so much of the oil is returned to the water.</p>
        <p>Now Victoria Broje and Arturo A. Keller of the University of California, Santa Barbara, have come up with a skimmer design that combines larger surface area with scrapeability. It is quite simple: a grooved drum with a scraper to match.</p>
        <p>In a paper to be published next month in Environmental Science and Technology, the researchers describe their design and the tests that were conducted at the National Oil Spill Response Test Facility in Leonardo, N.J.</p>
        <p>The amount of oil that can be collected depends on the viscosity of the liquid and on the depth and width of the V-shaped grooves. With a groove of a certain width, the oil that collects forms a meniscus that prevents it from draining off the drum before it is scraped off.</p>
        <p>The tests showed that although the new design is not ideal for every situation, it can be up to three times more efficient than a smooth drum. It was especially good at collecting diesel fuel, which is difficult to clean up because of its low viscosity.</p>
        <p>Dangerous Drug, for Birds</p>
        <p>By now the link between vulture deaths on the Indian subcontinent and the drug diclofenac has been well established. Three species of the birds have been practically wiped out from eating carcasses of cattle and other livestock that were treated with the drug, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent.</p>
        <p>But a new survey of 870 veterinary cases around the world shows that scavenging birds other than vultures may be at risk from diclofenac and similar drugs.</p>
        <p>Richard Cuthbert of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and colleagues found that deaths were reported among raptors, storks, cranes and owls. Since the drugs are used in large parts of the world, including South America and southern Africa, they represent a potential threat to birds in those areas. The findings were reported in the journal Biology Letters.</p>
        <p>Spiders, Peppers and a Pathway to Pain</p>
        <p>Chili peppers and tarantulas would seem to have little in common. One's a shiny fruit, after all, and the other's a hairy arachnid.</p>
        <p>But they have both been known to cause pain -- one when you bite into it, the other when it bites you. Now scientists have discovered something else that ties chilies to tarantulas, and it has to do with that pain: they activate the same biochemical pathway in the nervous system to unleash it.</p>
        <p>Much is known about how chilies and other hot peppers cause a burning sensation (beyond the effect on enchiladas, it helps the pepper plant deter predators). Peppers contain capsaicin, a compound that activates a receptor (called TRPV1) that increases the flow of ions into nerve cells, causing a signal to be sent to the brain.</p>
        <p>Much is also known about certain venoms, including those of some tarantulas, that can shut down parts of the nervous system and cause death. But tarantula bites can also cause acute pain, and little is known about how that works on the nervous system.</p>
        <p>''Plants have evolved to use these TRP channels as common sites of action for deterring prey,'' said David Julius of the University of California, San Francisco. ''But what about animals? Has evolution picked out the same targets, but maybe through a different chemical strategy?''</p>
        <p>With Jan Siemens and other colleagues, Dr. Julius found out, using venom from 22 tarantulas and scorpions that they exposed to cultured mouse nerve cells with the TRPV1 receptor. One venom, from a tarantula native to the West Indies, activated the receptor. The findings were published in Nature.</p>
        <p>Further analysis showed that the compounds in the venom were from a family of peptides known as ICK. Most of these peptides, particularly those in toxins that cause paralysis, inhibit receptors. This makes sense for a lethal toxin, Dr. Julius said, ''because it wants to shut down the activity of the nerve cells so you die.'' But the peptides in the spider venom work the opposite way, by activating the receptor and allowing the flow of ions into the cell.</p>
        <p>Knowing what compounds are involved will help biochemists in further studies of the capsaicin receptor and similar pathways. ''In the world of ion channels and receptors, identifying toxins is important for understanding how these molecules work,'' Dr. Julius said. ''These are good biochemical tools.''</p>
