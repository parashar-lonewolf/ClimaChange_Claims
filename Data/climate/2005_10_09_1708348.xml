        <p>THE first Saturday in October was clear, dry and drenched in bright sunlight -- ideal for the solar panels converting light to electricity at Harry Kubetz and Gary Burton's home in Northport.</p>
        <p>''Today is a peak power day,'' Mr. Burton said, looking up at a rooftop covered with 80 solar panels. ''We're probably producing enough power to meet our demand for the day.''</p>
        <p>In fact, according to the digital meter on the side of the house, the panels were making more electricity than the house needed. A small black arrow pointed left, indicating that excess electricity was being sent back to the Long Island Power Authority.</p>
        <p>The Northport home was one of 67 stops on a solar energy tour across Long Island. The free tour, set up by Renewable Energy Long Island, an alternative energy advocacy group, was self-guided, covering residences and businesses with solar systems in Nassau and Suffolk Counties.</p>
        <p>Lower prices for solar equipment, higher efficiency and tax and rebate incentives from government and utility companies have caused more Long Islanders to look to lower their energy costs with solar power.</p>
        <p>Over the last year, demand ''has skyrocketed'' for these systems, said Jonathan Lane, who owns Quad State Solar, the company that installed the system for Mr. Kubetz and Mr. Burton. ''Within the last three months, there has been a huge increase in the number of inquiries and in the number of sales,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Another sign that prices are going down and demand is increasing is the lower rebate offered by the power authority. Mr. Kubetz and Mr. Burton received $5 per watt for their 10 kilowatt system -- or $50,000.</p>
        <p>Their system cost $81,000 to install. Of that, a total of $27,250 came out of their pockets after the rebate and a state tax credit of $3,750, a maximum that will rise to $5,000 in September 2006. A federal tax credit of 30 percent of the cost of a solar system, up to $2,000 for homes, will also apply after Jan. 1.</p>
        <p>But today, with 560 homes and businesses powered by solar energy on Long Island, the LIPA rebate is down to $4 per watt, and the utility expects to lower it further to $3.75 in mid- to late 2006 if solar system prices continue to go down, said Daniel Zaweski, the director of energy efficiency and distributed generation programs at the power authority.</p>
        <p>The average 5 kilowatt residential solar system costs nearly $40,000 to buy and install, according to Gordian Raacke, director of Renewable Energy Long Island. The homeowner would pay about $15,000 after a $20,000 LIPA rebate and state and federal tax credits.</p>
        <p>Such a system can reduce electric bills by 20 to 100 percent, according to Sharon Laudisi of the Long Island Power Authority, depending on the amount and duration of sunlight hitting the solar panels and on electricity use in the home.</p>
        <p>Solar energy systems, also called ''PV's,'' short for photovoltaic cells, convert sunlight to electricity without combustion, creating power without pollution. There are also solar systems for heating water and pools.</p>
        <p>Solar panels do not store energy, and they supply electricity only when the sun is shining on them. Since most homes have their solar systems connected to the LIPA grid, they draw energy back from the authority at night or on cloudy days, using the credits earned while supplying electricity during the day.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kubetz and Mr. Burton offered drinks to the steady stream of visitors who came to ask about their system, examine a panel on the patio for display, talk with Domenica Tantillo of Quad State Solar or pet Dulcinea, one of the family dogs.</p>
        <p>One couple, Larry and Kathy Moran, already have electric heat and an electric stove in their house. ''We're going through renovations on the house now,'' Mr. Moran said. ''Now might be a good time'' to install a solar system.</p>
        <p>In Westbury, some visitors to Michael and Regina Diehl's solar-powered home lamented their rising utility bills. Electricity costs on Long Island are among the highest in the nation.</p>
        <p>''The cost of energy is so high, and now there's this LIPA surcharge,'' said Peter Margaritis, of Albertson, referring to the recent 5.5 percent surcharge increase announced by the power authority to cover higher fuel costs. ''We have natural gas heating, and that's going to go up 70 percent this year.''</p>
        <p>His father-in-law, John Weber, a licensed electrician, accompanied him to see the Diehls' installation. ''We're looking to do both solar hot water for heating and PV for electricity to become minimally dependent on buying electricity and gas,'' Mr. Margaritis said.</p>
        <p>Judging by the number of electricians visiting the Diehl home with the idea of getting into the business, solar-generated electricity seems to be taking off.</p>
        <p>''I'm looking to install for people,'' said Jason Verrelli, 31, an electrician from Floral Park, who said he does mostly residential work. ''All the time, people ask me, 'Do you know anything about solar power?'''</p>
        <p>Mr. Verrelli wants to get into the business as soon as possible. ''It's going to get more efficient, and it's going to get cheaper,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He visited the Westbury home because Mr. Diehl is a licensed electrician who installed his solar system himself. His utility bills are zero, Mr. Diehl said, and he may even get a check from the power authority at the end of the year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Raacke of Renewable Energy Long Island want to increase the home of solar-powered homes on Long Island to 700 by year-end.</p>
        <p>The Web site of the organization, renewableenergylongisland.org, has a cost calculator and a listing of licensed and insured contractors.</p>
        <p>But not everyone who wants a solar system can benefit from one. Since the panels need sunlight to generate electricity, they don't do much for a home if they are in the shade.</p>
        <p>William Zajic stopped by the Northport house to take a look. He has been thinking about installing a solar system at his Dix Hills home. ''I have a pool, and I like to live lavishly,'' said Mr. Zajic, a computer modeler for hedge fund traders, ''but I am as concerned about the environment as anybody else.''</p>
        <p>The biggest obstacle in his home is an aesthetic one, he said: his wife doesn't like the way they look. Making matters worse, the only part of his roof that isn't shaded by trees faces the street, he said.</p>
        <p>And the pitch of the roof is less than the optimal 35 to 40 degrees, so his panels would require a frame to raise them off the roof, making them stand out even more.</p>
        <p>There are some options, Ms. Tantillo told him, including panels that look like slate roof tiles. They are 30 percent more efficient than standard panels, but more expensive to install.</p>
        <p>But when it comes to trees, ''shade is a killer for PV,'' Mr. Lane said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kubetz and Mr. Burton like the modern look that the sleek reflective solar panels add to the back of their suburban ranch. Besides saving about $2,000 a year on utility bills, there's the matter of conscience.</p>
        <p>''I could personally afford to pay a larger bill,'' Mr. Kubetz said, ''but I think Americans consume way too much energy.''</p>
