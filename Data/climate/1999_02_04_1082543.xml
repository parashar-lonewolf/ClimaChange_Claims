        <p>The students at Intermediate School 135 in the Bronx, which had been closed since Friday after about 80 pupils and teachers mysteriously became sick there, returned to school yesterday. The children seemed fine, but some of their parents were sick with worry.</p>
        <p>City school officials believe that excessive heat in many classrooms was the likely cause of the widespread illness, which left students and staff members complaining of dizziness, pain and vomiting. But several parents said they were dissatisfied with that explanation and complained to Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew, who made a brief visit to the school at 2441 Wallace Avenue in Bronxdale, about his decision to reopen it.</p>
        <p>''I'm very upset,'' Sarah Siegel, the president of the Parents' Association, said to the Chancellor. ''By right these children should not be in the school today.'' Mr. Crew said he disagreed.</p>
        <p>Lewis H. Spence, the Board of Education's deputy chancellor for operations, said yesterday that a number of city agencies and representatives of the United Federation of Teachers conducted environmental tests at the school over the weekend, which did not yield any conclusive results. ''To date, we cannot find a single possible toxic cause,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spence said officials believe that excessive heat and low humidity, perhaps laced with a tiny amount of hydrogen sulfide from the heating system, may have caused the illness.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spence said that 60 of the school's 80 thermostats were not working, and failed to cut off heat entering many classrooms even though they were warm enough, and that some classroom's windows did not open. Temperatures in many classrooms last week reached 85 or 90 degrees, he said, while the humidity was less than 10 percent.</p>
        <p>''You have a school that's so hot and dry it's like the Sahara,'' he said. The three classrooms that had generated the most complaints of symptoms will stay closed through the week so that testing can continue, Mr. Spence said, adding that five or six people would remain at the school with testing equipment.</p>
        <p>At the school yesterday, Dr. Crew said he had decided to reopen most classrooms because he believed they were safe. ''Every precaution has been taken so far to make sure the problems we had will not be repeated,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Siegel, the P.T.A. president, and several other parents who had come to the school for a briefing by health officials, scientists, epidemiologists and Board of Education representatives said they had kept their children home yesterday. The school's attendance, which is usually 90 percent or more, was at 73 percent yesterday, the school principal, Dr. Carole Valentino, said.</p>
        <p>''It's not safe,'' said Noelia Hernandez, whose son, Miguel, is in the sixth grade. ''I'm going to keep my son home until we know for sure.''</p>
        <p>Some parents said the briefing provided little new information, and if they did not get answers they would insist that their children be transferred. The Board of Education said such requests were unlikely to be granted.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Valentino said she supported the Chancellor's decision. ''In my heart today I really wanted to open the school,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The children, meanwhile, were of mixed opinions -- often mirroring those of their parents. Katrina Lajqi, a 12-year-old in sixth grade, said she had come for the meeting yesterday, but did not attend school and would not today, either. ''They should just leave the school closed today,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But Hector Algarin, 12, said he was eager to return to school and was not worried about getting sick. He said he hoped that reducing the temperature in the building might alleviate the headaches he often got in school.</p>
        <p>And the school did manage to turn the crisis into an educational opportunity: Accompanied by guidance counselors, environmental investigators went from classroom to classroom, demonstrating how to test for carbon dioxide and poison (there was none) in the air.</p>
        <p>''The kids loved it,'' Dr. Valentino said.</p>
