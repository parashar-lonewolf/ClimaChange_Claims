        <p>Solidly red, or an incursion of blue? The Republicans try to hold onto their turf.</p>
        <p>ALASKA</p>
        <p>After beating the Republican incumbent in the primary, Sarah Palin, the mayor of an Anchorage suburb, held a strong lead this morning over a Democratic former governor, Tony Knowles, with half of the votes counted. She hoped to become Alaska's first female governor. Alaska's congressman, Don Young, was re-elected to a 17th term.</p>
        <p>ARIZONA</p>
        <p>Immigration was the defining issue in Arizona, where Senator Jon Kyl, the once-untouchable Republican, won a tough re-election campaign against the Democratic challenger, Jim Pederson, a shopping mall developer and former state Democratic Party chairman. With 95 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. Kyl had 53 percent of the vote compared with 44 for Mr. Pederson.</p>

        <p>ALASKA</p>
        <p>After beating the Republican incumbent in the primary, Sarah Palin, the mayor of an Anchorage suburb, held a strong lead this morning over a Democratic former governor, Tony Knowles, with half of the votes counted. She hoped to become Alaska's first female governor. Alaska's congressman, Don Young, was re-elected to a 17th term.</p>
        <p>ARIZONA</p>
        <p>Immigration was the defining issue in Arizona, where Senator Jon Kyl, the once-untouchable Republican, won a tough re-election campaign against the Democratic challenger, Jim Pederson, a shopping mall developer and former state Democratic Party chairman. With 95 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. Kyl had 53 percent of the vote compared with 44 for Mr. Pederson.</p>
        <p>Representative J. D. Hayworth, a Republican in a conservative district, lost his fight for a seventh term to Harry Mitchell, also a former state Democratic Party chairman. The seat of Representative Jim Kolbe, a Republican who is retiring, was won by the Democrat, Gabrielle Giffords. Mr. Kolbe refused to endorse the Republican candidate who won the primary.</p>
        <p>Voters approved a largely symbolic ballot measure to make English the official language of Arizona, though many Hispanic voters opposed the measure. Other initiatives included an increase in the minimum wage, antismoking measures and one to amend the state Constitution to ban same-sex unions. Another initiative would prevent illegal immigrants from participating in certain state-financed programs.</p>
        <p>Gov. Janet Napolitano, a Democrat, defeated her Republican opponent, Len Munsil.</p>
        <p>CALIFORNIA</p>
        <p>A Republican in a Democratic state, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger began the year in trouble after voters rejected his bid to reshape Sacramento with ballot initiatives. But he mended fences with the Legislature, moved to the center, and easily won his first full term.</p>
        <p>Senator Dianne Feinstein was re-elected, and a fellow Democrat, former Gov. Jerry Brown, was leading in early returns for attorney general, hoping to return to statewide office after 24 years.</p>
        <p>In races influenced by the national anti-Republican mood, Republican Representatives Richard Pombo and John Doolittle were in neck-and-neck races for re-election.</p>
        <p>Californians weighed a variety of initiatives, including one to require parental notification before a minor can have an abortion, a $2.60-per-pack increase in cigarette taxes, a lifetime monitoring of sex offenders via a global positioning system and a ban on eminent-domain seizure of private property for private use.</p>
        <p>COLORADO</p>
        <p>A strong Democratic showing turned Colorado from red to purple. Democrats elected a governor, expanded their share of Colorado's seven-seat Congressional delegation to at least four from three, and appeared likely to maintain their hold on both houses of the legislature, partial returns indicated.</p>
        <p>In the race to succeed Gov. Bill Owens, a Republican who is retiring, Bill Ritter, a Democrat and former Denver district attorney who campaigned as a problem-solver, defeated Representative Bob Beauprez, a Republican.</p>
        <p>In the election for the seat Mr. Beauprez vacated in the Denver suburbs, former State Senator Ed Perlmutter, a Democrat, defeated the Republican, Rick O'Donnell, a Republican former chairman of the state's Commission on Higher Education.</p>
        <p>In the Congressional district that represents Colorado's eastern prairie counties and Fort Collins, partial returns showed the Republican, Representative Marilyn Musgrave, in a surprisingly tight contest with the Democrat, State Representative Angie Paccione.</p>
        <p>Even before the vote, some Republicans were blaming not only the war in Iraq but also conservatives in their party for nominating extreme candidates who irritated moderates.</p>
        <p>HAWAII</p>
        <p>Senator Daniel K. Akaka, a Democrat, appeared headed for an easy victory over his Republican challenger, State Representative Cynthia Thielen, to win his third full term. Gov. Linda Lingle, a Republican, was running for a second term and was expected to withstand a challenge from the Democratic candidate, Randy Iwase, a former state senator.</p>
        <p>IDAHO</p>
        <p>This heavily Republican state had two surprisingly close races. A three-term Republican congressman, C. L. Otter, known as Butch, was ahead of a Democratic newspaper publisher, Jerry Brady, with 42 percent of precincts reporting. Gov. James E. Risch -- a Republican who took office in May after his predecessor, Dirk Kempthorne, became the United States interior secretary -- decided not to seek a full term but to instead run for his former job as lieutenant governor. In the western of Idaho's two House districts, which Mr. Otter represents, State Representative Bill Sali, a Republican, had an early lead over Larry Grant, a Democratic lawyer.</p>
        <p>On the ballot were a proposition to limit the use of eminent domain for economic development and a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage.</p>
        <p>MONTANA</p>
        <p>The Senate contest here could not have been tighter or the stakes bigger: Jon Tester, a Democrat, was leading Senator Conrad Burns, a Republican seeking his fourth term. With 64 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. Tester was ahead, 51 percent of the vote to 47 percent.</p>
        <p>In surveys of voters leaving the polls, 60 percent said they believed Mr. Burns had been in office too long and 55 percent said they disapproved of the way President Bush was handling his job.</p>
        <p>Gov. Brian Schweitzer has used the race to promote a new style of Western Democrat: strong on gun rights and environmental protection, against free trade deals and in favor of the death penalty, lower taxes and abortion rights. The national significance drew recent visits by Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney in support of Mr. Burns.</p>
        <p>Voters approved an increase in the minimum wage to $6.15 and a measure banning certain state officials from becoming lobbyists too soon after leaving their government jobs.</p>
        <p>NEVADA</p>
        <p>An accusation of an improper sexual advance helped narrow the gubernatorial race in Nevada, but Jim Gibbons, a Republican congressman from Reno, had enjoyed a sizable lead over Dina Titus, a Democratic state senator, until late last month when a waitress accused him of trying to force himself upon her in a garage.</p>
        <p>With 85 percent of the precincts reporting, Mr. Gibbons led by 14,000 votes, or a 47-percent-to-45-percent margin.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gibbons has denied the accusation and has said he walked the woman to the garage and steadied her when she stumbled. Footage from security cameras could prove crucial.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gibbons and Ms. Titus, a political science professor, competed to replace Gov. Kenny Guinn, a popular Republican who cannot run again because of term limits.</p>
        <p>In the Senate race, John Ensign, a Republican, was on track to soundly beat Jack Carter, a Democrat and son of former President Jimmy Carter.</p>
        <p>Nevadans also rejected a proposal that would have legalized marijuana. A separate proposal banning smoking in public places was too close to call.</p>
        <p>NEW MEXICO</p>
        <p>In a House race where Democrats hoped to wrest a seat from Republicans, the Democratic attorney general, Patricia A. Madrid, led the incumbent, Heather A. Wilson, by less than a percentage point with 59 percent of precincts reporting.</p>
        <p>Iraq was a hot topic in this campaign to represent a district around Albuquerque that has sent Republicans to the House for nearly 40 years. Ms. Wilson, a former National Security Council staff member, sits on the House Intelligence Committee, and Ms. Madrid has held her partly to blame for inaccurate reports on Iraq's weapons programs.</p>
        <p>New Mexico's Democratic senator, Jeff Bingaman, and Democratic governor, Bill Richardson, won easy re-election, as did the state's other two representatives, a Democrat and a Republican.</p>
        <p>OREGON</p>
        <p>Gov. Theodore R. Kulongoski, a Democrat, won re-election, overcoming a tough challenge from his Republican opponent, Ron Saxton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Saxton had cast the race as a referendum on four years of ''lackluster leadership'' by Mr. Kulongoski. He promised new ideas to improve schools and increase the efficiency of state government.</p>
        <p>The state's five House members, four Democrats and one Republican, all won re-election. Representative Darlene Hooley, a five-term Democrat, faced the stiffest challenge, in the Fifth District, from Mike Erickson, a businessman who put more than $1.3 million of his money into the race. Mr. Erickson said he was ''not part of the partisan bickering, not a part of the scandals'' in Washington.</p>
        <p>Voters were also deciding an initiative on parental notification for abortions.</p>
        <p>UTAH</p>
        <p>Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the ranking Republican on the Finance and Judiciary Committees, easily won a sixth term, defeating a Democratic opponent, Peter Ashdown, the founder of an Internet service provider. Utah's three House incumbents, two Republicans and one Democrat, were easily re-elected.</p>
        <p>WASHINGTON</p>
        <p>Senator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat, defeated her Republican challenger, Michael McGavick, to win her first re-election bid.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cantwell's seat seemed in jeopardy earlier this year, when she faced tough criticism from liberal constituents over her 2002 vote to authorize the use of force in Iraq. She rebounded, though, managing to fend off Mr. McGavick, a business executive, and three left-wing rivals with a solid campaign based on issues like renewable energy and environmental preservation; both are dear to local voters.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cantwell opposed the repeal of the federal estate tax, and a majority of voters agreed with her. With 28 percent of the precincts reporting, it was unclear if the other two other initiatives on the state ballot, which dealt with energy conservation and eminent domain, would be approved.</p>
        <p>WYOMING</p>
        <p>Representative Barbara Cubin won her at-large House seat during Newt Gingrich's ''Republican revolution'' of 1994. But even in conservative Wyoming, Ms. Cubin's sometimes caustic personality turned off some voters and gave Gary Trauner a once unthinkable chance of winning a seat for Democrats in Vice President Dick Cheney's home state. Ms. Cubin was leading Mr. Trauner by about 650 votes with 98 percent counted in a race that was too close to call. Gov. Dave Freudenthal, a Democrat, and Senator Craig Thomas, a Republican, kept their seats.</p>
        <p>THE 2006 ELECTIONS: STATE BY STATE</p>
        <p>Correction:  November 22, 2006, Wednesday  Reports about Washington State in the State by State election summary on Nov. 8 and 9 referred incorrectly to a voter initiative on property rights, which was defeated. The measure would make governments pay for enacting zoning restrictions that reduce the value of private land; it would not regulate eminent domain.</p>
