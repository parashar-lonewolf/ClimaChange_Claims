        <p>BY far the handsomest plant in my garden right now is a huge colony of a crocosmia called Lucifer. I would say that the plants have increased in number over the years until I almost have enough, except that there's no upper limit on my desire for it.</p>

        <p>BY far the handsomest plant in my garden right now is a huge colony of a crocosmia called Lucifer. I would say that the plants have increased in number over the years until I almost have enough, except that there's no upper limit on my desire for it.</p>
        <p>Rising as much as four feet above the handsome sword-like foliage, the flowers are borne on tough but wiry branching stems that grow at odd angles. The flowers start opening at the base of their stemlet, which bears 20 or more buds.</p>
        <p>The blossoms -- slightly irregular flaring tubes or trumpets -- keep opening over a period of weeks. They are a marvelous bold crimson-orange, with a dark-red eye around their golden throats, and they have a crystalline gleam. They are terrific cut flowers for a mixed bouquet, and in the garden they make an arresting picture.</p>
        <p>But something is very wrong here. My crocosmias started blooming on June 25, and I have always considered them one of the stars of the late-season garden. In previous years, Lucifer has started to shine the last week in August or even later. Lucifer has jumped the gun.</p>
        <p>And it is not alone. Elsewhere in my garden I have discovered buds showing on several tall perennial asters or Michaelmas daisies, which have invariably always bloomed from mid-September into October. Sweet goldenrod (Solidago odora), which I love for its anise-scented leaves and its foamy panicles of bright yellow flowers in September, is close to blooming.</p>
        <p>The sedum called Autumn Joy is showing such great momentum that this year its name should be Summer Joy. The Oriental lilies like Stargazer and Casablanca are flowering now, three weeks ahead of schedule. And a friend across town reports that one of her Japanese anemones, a splendid pink cultivar named September Charm, now has buds that will open early next week.</p>
        <p>I get similar reports from other quarters. A friend in Manhattan tells me that her cimicifuga, or white snakeroot, a species that blooms in very late summer, is already showing tall spikes. Another friend in Schenectady says that many of her late-blooming plants are coming on early.</p>
        <p>And still another, who lives in Hamilton, Ontario, has written to ask if I have any theory about why autumn seems to be arriving in July, but without cool nights and spectacular color in the woods.</p>
        <p>I am not about to leap to the conclusion that the greenhouse effect is upon us. But I will not hesitate to conclude that throughout the East, 1991 has been a hellish year for gardeners. Spring was brief, and the dog days bit us in May with the soaring temperatures and high humidity that are more typical of August.</p>
        <p>Georgia got too much rain recently, and plants are rotting there. But from the Carolinas into upstate New York and southern Ontario, it has been pitifully dry.</p>
        <p>The New York City area has had a fair amount of rainfall, but since the end of April, my part of New Jersey has had a drought of Biblical proportions, like the one that God sent the children of Israel because Queen Jezebel was flirting with the priests of Baal. There has been some faint drizzle here, but barely enough to wet the surface of the soil.</p>
        <p>I got excited when a couple of July thunderstorms gathered on the horizon and then rushed through with high wind, spectacular lightning and claps of thunder loud enough to awaken Rip Van Winkle. I closed the storm windows, but 20 minutes after the rain, the street pavements were dry. Last weekend some very local storms dumped 12 inches of rain on a town just up the road. I got a half-inch at best.</p>
        <p>Heroic watering has kept things going in my garden, but barberries, cotoneasters and dogwoods have scorched branches.</p>
        <p>Some of the people in my neighborhood who don't grow many flowers and who think that a green lawn testifies to the world that they are decent and virtuous are going to be sorry.</p>
        <p>They have kept sprinklers going day and night out on the lawn, but they have neglected to give their shrubbery the deep soaking with a bubbler or a leaky-pipe hose that conditions call for.</p>
        <p>As for autumn bloom in the middle of the summer, the onset of flowering in the fall is triggered by one of two things: lengthening nights, or total accumulation of heat.</p>
        <p>Those chrysanthemums in bud in upstate New York are puzzling, since it's usually diminishing day-length that's said to spur them to bloom. As for the other plants, I suspect that they just experienced so much heat over so prolonged a period that they've decided, "Enough already! Let's just bloom and get it over with."</p>
        <p>That crocosmia was merely a harbinger of the seasons out of whack. Blue leadwort (Ceratostigma plumbaginoides), a terrific groundcover for bulb plantings because it emerges late and grows slowly at first, is thick, lusty and covered with cerulean blue flowers. In 20 years of gardening in the same place, I have never seen a single blossom on this plant until around Labor Day.</p>
        <p>Also blooming is Patrinia scarbiosifolia, a plant collected recently in Korea, whose Japanese form has long been considered by the Japanese as one of their seven traditional flowers of autumn.</p>
        <p>For the last five or six years this has been almost a cult plant among adventurous gardeners as a superb addition to the garden in mid-autumn.</p>
        <p>The final mystery came last week, when I saw what Sedum sicboldii was up to. This is clearly one of the most beautiful of all the many sedums. It makes a graceful little mound, with steely blue-leafed stems arching from its center from late spring on. The clusters of daphne-pink flowers, which usually appear in the middle of October or later, are about to burst into bloom.</p>
        <p>What will be left to bloom this September, if anything? I may just have to be content with hostas, heuchere Palace Purple, caladiums and other plants that I grow not for their flowers but for their colorful foliage.  A GARDENER'S WORLD  Correction:  July 29, 1991, Monday</p>
        <p>A picture caption in The Home Section on July 18 misidentified the garden where a Hibiscus moscheutos bloomed early. It was the Conservatory Garden in Central Park, not the Central Park Conservatory.</p>
