        <p>LEAD: When the people who manage the 100,000 tons of sewage sludge produced annually by this city are asked what they do with it, they point to a forest of unusually large conifers.</p>
        <p>When the people who manage the 100,000 tons of sewage sludge produced annually by this city are asked what they do with it, they point to a forest of unusually large conifers.</p>
        <p>''We grow trees with it,'' said Jim Lindler, a spokesman for Seattle Metro, a regional government body. Because trees fertilized with Seattle sludge grow twice as fast as normal, private timber companies are lining up to buy the processed waste of the city's toilets and sinks. Currently, there is a supply shortage.</p>
        <p>In San Jose, Calif., a city with one of the lowest garbage disposal rates in the nation and plenty of landfill space, nearly 60 percent of the households recycle their refuse through a voluntary city program - the highest participation figure in country.</p>
        <p>With few places left to dispose of the nation's garbage, Americans, who throw out an average of 1,300 pounds of trash a year per person, have taken to recycling in record numbers.</p>
        <p>After years of failure and sputtering starts, dozens of cities across the nation are boasting of recycling programs for trash and sludge that have succeeded far beyond official expectations. U.S. Goal: 25 Percent</p>
        <p>The cities have found that household waste water, recycled as nutrient-rich sludge, is in strong demand among farmers, timber companies and landscapers. Recycled paper, glass, metal and plastics are being scooped up as never before through innovative curbside programs.</p>
        <p>The recycling movement has come up from the neighborhoods and suburbs, fueled by rising disposal costs and resentment against construction of incinerators. After reviewing the successful programs of several cities, the Federal Government last month set a 1992 goal of recycling 25 percent of the 160 million tons of garbage generated annually in the United States. The current level is 10 percent.</p>
        <p>Recycling does pose problems, particularly in bigger cities, where the logistical difficulties can be enormous. Experts foresee a shortage of markets for many recycled products, especially plastic, and they say some cities will not come around to recycling unless they are forced to.</p>
        <p>Ten states - Rhode Island, Connecticut, Maine, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Florida, Hawaii, Oregon, Wisconsin and Maryland - have mandatory recycling, and more than 500 communities have curbside pickup programs. Caught off guard by the success of some programs, recycling experts say there appears to be pent-up demand among citizens who want to do something about the mountains of trash in their cities.</p>
        <p>Eight months after Seattle began a voluntary recycling program, nearly 60 percent of the city's households are taking part. While some officials attribute the success to a regional environmental ethic, others say simple economics and convenience have made the program go.</p>
        <p>Half the city's residents don't even have to sort the material. They are issued 90-gallon containers, into which they dump papers, glass and metal. Private contractors pick up the containers once a month and sort the materials. Next month, the city will begin recycling plastics. Because garbage disposal fees are based on volume, residents who do not recycle pay much more than those who do.</p>
        <p>About 28 percent of Seattle's garbage, 2,500 tons a month, is now recycled. Both figures are the highest in the nation, and the city is trying to double them in the next few years.</p>
        <p>Seattle, which used to dump the solid residues from its sewage in Puget Sound, now recycles 100 percent of the sludge, much of it as commerical fertilizer free of toxins and harmful bacteria.</p>
        <p>Los Angeles mixes its sludge with sawdust and sells it as compost. Milwaukee markets its sludge under the trade name Milorganite; it is used as a nutrient for grass and playing fields. According to Environmental Protection Agency figures, 25 percent of the nation's 7.6 million dry tons of sludge produced annually is now recycled.</p>
        <p>Only New York and New Jersey still dump their sludge in the ocean. A law passed by Congress last week and awaiting the signature of President Reagan would gradually end the practice.</p>
        <p>Mandatory recycling laws, pioneered in Oregon, New Jersey and Rhode Island, are on the rise. In signing a law last summer that made Pennsylvania the largest state with a mandatory recycling program, Gov. Robert P. Casey said, ''All over the nation it's as plain as the eye can see or the nose can smell that we have to change our ways.'' Some Success in New York</p>
        <p>New York City, which produces more garbage than any other municipality in the country, has taken more cautiously to recycling. Laura Denman, director of the city's recycling program, said that after several years of experimental projects, nearly 10 percent of the city's households are taking part in a curbside recycling effort.</p>
        <p>Despite New York's relatively low numbers, Ms. Denman said the program has been a success because ''a lot of people said we could never do any kind of home recycling in New York.''</p>
        <p>Federal officials say recycling has caught on because the other two garbage disposal options, landfills and incinerators, are losing favor. Eighty percent of the country's garbage is deposited in landfills, but nearly a third of those dump sites will reach capacity in the next five years, the Environmental Protection Agency says.</p>
        <p>Incinerators have been implicated as causes of air pollution and acid rain, and officials are having trouble finding communities that will accept new ones. In the last two years, 31 incinerator projects that would have cost a total of $3 billion have been shelved.</p>
        <p>Americans continue to generate more garbage than ever. Municipal solid waste has increased 80 percent since 1960, and the E.P.A. expects it to increase another 20 percent in the next 10 years.</p>
        <p>Some experts say that all this garbage has produced an incentive for recycling: guilt.</p>
        <p>Richard Gertman, San Jose's recycling mananger, said: ''It would be cheaper for us to throw it all out as garbage, but people love to recycle. They can't control air pollution or traffic. But through this program, they feel like they can do something.''</p>
        <p>Officials from cities where recycling has taken off say that convenience is the key to making it work. Typically, each household is given three seprate containers, one for each type of recyclable material, which are then picked up on a regular basis. Programs that have been less successful involve too much sorting or too much individual initiative.</p>
        <p>Federal officials say most cities should at least recycle all their yard waste and paper products, which make up 61 percent of municipal garbage and are among the easiest to market.</p>
        <p>What has kept some cities from starting large programs is a lack of markets for the recycled material, said Robin Woods, a spokeswoman for the E.P.A. To avoid the problem in the future, the Federal Government last month began several studies to find and develop new markets for recycled plastics, paper, yard waste, metal and glass, said Ms. Woods.</p>
        <p>''Markets are just now starting to open up for most everything we recycle,'' said Steve Beseke, a spokesman for the Minneapolis recycling program. ''If you can't sell the stuff, your program won't work.''</p>
        <p>Plastic is being re-used in building material, water pipes, small containers and insulation for coats. Most newsprint is shipped overseas, stripped of its ink, then re-used by newspapers. Glass and metals are melted down at regional centers.</p>
        <p>Despite the rush of new programs, experts say that Americans are a long way from other countries. Japan recycles 50 percent of its garbage, a figure matched by several European nations.</p>
