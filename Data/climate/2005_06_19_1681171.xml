        <p>ONE SOLDIER'S STORY: A Memoir. By Bob Dole. (HarperCollins, $25.95.) Memoirs are generally exercises in revelation. Dole's is a study in reticence. By his studiously self-deprecating account, he was a decent athlete, a below-average student, and -- after joining the Army's fabled 10th Mountain Division in World War II -- a mediocre lieutenant. It is only after he is horrifically wounded on the Italian front that we begin to get a hint of the strength that helped Dole ascend almost to the pinnacle of American politics, or a flash of his bone-dry wit. (''The mere thought of being back on American soil sent electricity through me,'' he writes of his time in a hospital bed encased in plaster. ''At least, I think it did.'') It took more than a year of agonizing physical therapy before Dole could even stand again, and months of operations to allow him to so much as hold a pen in his battered right hand. But the moments of intimacy -- as when Dole confesses that to this day he cannot bear to look himself in the mirror, save to shave or comb his hair -- are rare. The politician's opacity in his writing frustrates true revelation.</p>
        <p>SUNSET LIMITED: The Southern Pacific Railroad and the Development of the American West, 1850-1930. By Richard J. Orsi. (University of California, $29.95.) By the early 20th century, the Southern Pacific Railroad composed the world's largest transportation system, with tracks that ran from New Orleans to Portland, Ore.; steamship lines that extended beyond America's shores; and a reputation as ''the major sponsor of graft, and the primary obstacle to government adaptation and reform'' in the American West. Orsi's revisionist account argues that in fact the company was instrumental to California's conversion into the breadbasket of the region. It supported policies designed to encourage small-scale farming at the expense of mining interests and speculators, not as ''mere public relations ploys'' but out of enlightened self-interest: getting the land into the hands of those who would cultivate it most aggressively was the best way to spur development and make the railroad more profitable. This account is dense and encyclopedic, but Orsi has a good eye for stories, like the one he tells about the ''evangel trains,'' schools-on-wheels that brought cutting-edge agricultural techniques to small farmers around the state with an air of ''religious revival.''</p>

By the early 20th century, the Southern Pacific Railroad composed the world's largest transportation system, with tracks that ran from New Orleans to Portland, Ore.; steamship lines that extended beyond America's shores; and a reputation as ''the major sponsor of graft, and the primary obstacle to government adaptation and reform'' in the American West.

        <p>THE WAY HOME: A German Childhood, an American Life. By Ernestine Bradley. (Pantheon, $24.) Compared to Teresa Heinz Kerry, Bradley didn't make much news during the months she accompanied her husband, Bill Bradley, the former senator from New Jersey, on his 2000 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. But her memoir is as lucid and bracing as ice water. Love drove Bradley's mother to divorce her stepfather and remarry the natural father the child barely knew, brewing a distrust of emotional attachment that took years to overcome. The end of World War II took her from her hometown, Passau, Germany, to the dreary, war-ravaged city of Ingolstadt, and left her with a sense of anomie that was almost overwhelming. ''This is how defeat felt to me,'' she writes. ''There were no fires, conflagrations, no apocalypse. . . . We were overrun by an indifferent mechanism of enormous magnitude -- not hostile, not frightening, simply indifferent.'' But ''The Way Home'' is a memoir of self-discovery, not defeat. Bradley learned from her grandfather that ''living without roots can give you a sense of freedom.'' In America, where she worked first as a flight attendant, she discovered that old identities are not always easy to shed. At Emory University in the 1960's, her doctoral thesis adviser gently but insistently pushed her to grapple with the Holocaust, ''assisting me in the birth of monstrous knowledge.'' After a disastrous first marriage, Bradley became a professor of German and comparative literature, met and married Bill, and survived breast cancer. ''Only now do I understand,'' she writes, that ''defeat is never permanent, nor triumph everlasting. Only memory seals these moments in unending glory.''</p>
        <p>BIG WEATHER: Chasing Tornadoes in the Heart of America. By Mark Svenvold. (John Macrae/ Holt, $26.) Like its subject, this book is a chaotic whirl, often inscrutable but occasionally exhilarating. Svenvold is best when zeroing in on characters like Sean Casey, a self-taught storm chaser who builds a seven-ton ''Tornado Intercept Vehicle'' to drive straight into a tornado and film it on IMAX cameras. The frequent bursts of tornado-geek jargon can be mystifying, and Svenvold, the poet-in-residence at Fordham, often purples his prose like a man who prefers to write verse. But a chapter skewering the Weather Channel for its advertiser-friendly view of a climate unaffected by global warming and other man-made environmental calamities hits home. In the post-Twister'' era, one expert tells Svenvold, bad weather has been ''monetized'' -- a peculiarly American response to the vicissitudes of wind and sky.</p>
        <p>VOICES FROM CHERNOBYL. By Svetlana Alexievich. Translated by Keith Gessen. (Dalkey Archive, $22.95.) This testimonial history is constructed of interviews collected in 1996 by a Belarussian journalist living in Paris, 10 years after the catastrophic explosion of the Chernobyl reactor. There's the filmmaker who can't smell the flowers blooming around him because his body has reacted to the radiation by shutting off his sense of smell; the doctor who treats workers carrying more radiation in their organs than is supposed to be possible, like a sick experiment on the living. ''My grandmother and grandfather remember that they never had a childhood, they had the war,'' says one survivor. ''Their childhood is the war, and mine is Chernobyl.'' It's an actual war zone, too, for the soldiers ordered to help clean the reactors. One who returns home burns all his clothes except his hat, which he gives to his son; two years later, the child is given a diagnosis of a brain tumor. Other monologues highlight the government incompetence that insured the damage caused by Chernobyl would spread, in time, literally around the globe. Seen through the eyes of those who lived through it, real-life Chernobyl begins to seem like a nightmare, with feral cats who hunt humans in packs and children born missing fingers -- or worse. Grim and grotesque, the stories accrete across the pages like the radionuclides lodged in the bodies of those who survived.</p>
        <p>INCIDENTAL FINDINGS: Lessons from My Patients in the Art of Medicine. By Danielle Ofri. (Beacon, $23.95.) Ofri's thoughtful and honest second book -- the title is inspired by her realization, during her own amniocentesis, that conditions that seem minor to doctors are monumental when they happen to you -- is equal parts ''The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat'' and ''Kitchen Confidential.'' It follows her as she begins life as an attending physician at Bellevue Hospital in New York City, and the clichés promoted in medical school ethics classes quickly wither. ''He was sick enough to be miserable, but not sick enough to die,'' she writes of a suicidal man suffering from a host of illnesses. ''I could not bring myself to utter flimsy platitudes about the value of life and how things would be better tomorrow. They weren't going to get better.'' Instead of recycled bread baskets and bacteria-laden hollandaise sauce, we get the lab test that never comes back and the patient who never follows up on her treatment. ''I start to resent her. . . to hate everything about her. I hate to see her name on the roster,'' Orsi writes. ''I ask as few questions as possible for fear of eliciting new, unsolvable complaints.'' Doogie Howser, M.D., she is not -- thank goodness.</p>
