        <p>Re ''Enlightenment on Energy'' (editorial, Oct. 22):</p>
        <p>A Union of Concerned Scientists study released last week found that establishing a national standard of 20 percent of American electricity coming from non-hydropower renewable energy by 2020, if combined with energy efficiency programs, would save consumers at least $70 billion, stimulate the economy, reduce the vulnerability of our energy infrastructure to terrorist attack, and greatly reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. A bill to achieve this has been introduced by Senator James M. Jeffords, and should be adopted as part of the Senate's overall energy package.</p>

        <p>Developing wind, solar, biomass, geothermal and other home-grown energy sources, along with increasing energy efficiency, is the best way to diversify America's energy supply.</p>
