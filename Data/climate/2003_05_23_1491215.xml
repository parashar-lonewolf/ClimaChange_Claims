        <p>Proton Energy Systems, which makes devices that use electricity to convert water into hydrogen for fuel cells, said yesterday that it would acquire Northern Power Systems, a leading designer of small power systems for businesses and institutions that want to generate their own electricity. Proton Energy, which is based in Wallingford, Conn., went public in 2000 at $17 a share and traded as high as $28.62 that year, but the price plummeted as the projected dates for widespread fuel cell use were repeatedly pushed back. It closed yesterday at $3.24, up 38 cents, or 13 percent, on the Nasdaq. Northern Power, a privately held company based in Waitsfield, Vt., has built hundreds of energy systems for pipelines, industrial sites and commercial buildings, many of them incorporating renewable energy sources. Proton will pay $27.5 million in cash and stock for Northern and issue warrants for Northern shareholders to buy 2.5 million Proton shares when the deal closes.</p>
