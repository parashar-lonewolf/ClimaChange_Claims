        <p>Fifteen months into self-rule, Gaza wears two masks.</p>
        <p>The first is the string of end-to-end cafes stretched for miles along the sea that come alive at night with music, gossip and water pipes, and the innumerable concrete skeletons of new buildings rising on every street, down the coast, over former orange groves.</p>
        <p>The other mask is one of wire fences and sandbagged bunkers that plug the Erez Crossing to the north and the swirls of concertina wire that seal the Egyptian border to the south, the open sewers of the teeming refugee camps and the writing on the walls: "Arafat, stop carrying out the orders of Rabin and Clinton. Your bullets do not terrify us."</p>
        <p>Nobody has taken a tally of the unemployed, but by rough count, one working Gazan feeds 20 hungry mouths.</p>
        <p>"In the beginning, it was all euphoria," said a long-time United Nations worker, remembering when Israeli soldiers withdrew in May 1994, taking with them the curfew, the identification checks and all the small and large humiliations of occupation. "But now the celebration and the misery have come into rough balance."</p>
        <p>For now, the celebrations and novelties are still more striking than the misery, perhaps because the misery has always been there.</p>
        <p>Each balmy night, it seems that everyone is out on the beach, in dramatic contrast to the years of the intifada, the street war against the Israelis, when Israeli soldiers enforced an 8-P.M.-to-4-A.M. curfew by night, and Islamic militants imposed rigorous social discipline by day.</p>
        <p>Now cars line the dunes on either side of the coastal road for miles as whole families crowd the seashore into the small hours of the morning, the children scampering in the sand and surf, the women in demure head coverings and floor-length dresses sipping cola, the men drawing on water pipes under the fronds of sprawling beach cafes. Beer and alcohol, however, are still alien here.</p>
        <p>New cafes open daily, along with hotels and wedding halls. A modern new playground in the center of Gaza City, built with foreign donations, is jam-packed. A few blocks away, in the shadow of the venerated Al-Kateba Mosque, young women, with all but their hands and faces covered, scream in delight as they spin in an amusement-park ride, one of several old Soviet-made rides that an enterprising Gazan recently leased from Israel.</p>
        <p>That novelty is nothing compared with the circus from Uzbekistan that recently packed up. Though stern Islamic moralists from Hamas, the Islamic opposition movement, inveighed against the scantily clad performers and the frivolity of it all, the circus was packed for all three weeks it was here.</p>
        <p>This is the season of weddings. During the day men gather under awnings at the groom's home for feasts of meat and spicy rice called qedra and wedding corteges wind constantly through the city with blaring horns. At night whole clans take over beachfront wedding clubs.</p>
        <p>In the daytime, Gaza City and much of the 30-mile-long Strip seem like one endless construction site, with palisades of scaffolding and concrete slabs in every size and shape -- apartment blocks, hotels, villas, shops.</p>
        <p>Nobody seems to know how many buildings are going up, and nobody is entirely sure what will happen when they all try to plug into electrical, water and sewage systems that have long been overtaxed. Power, normally at 240 volts, is down to 170 most of the time; the tap water has turned too brackish to drink, and disposal of sewage is roughly divided between what is pumped into the sea and what is dumped into the streets.</p>
        <p>The building boom is tangible evidence that there is money here, and at least some faith in the future. Much of the money has come with Gazans returning to test the economic waters of self-rule and to give their families that promised home.</p>
        <p>Cars are another new phenomenon in this land without a single functioning traffic light. Soaring numbers of cars fill the sand-clogged streets with a constant blare of horns as they lurch among barefoot children and donkey carts.</p>
        <p>It is an open secret that many of the cars were stolen in Israel. In fact, it is no secret at all, since the Palestinian Authority issues special purple plates for cars that have no documentation. So far, their police have done nothing about it, perhaps because many of their patrol cars also have the purple plates. Powder Keg To Many, Freedom Brings Frustration</p>
        <p>Gaza's other mask is revealed when Kalashnikov rifle fire erupts on a sweltering Friday afternoon in the teeming Sheik Radwan neighborhood of Gaza, a Hamas stronghold.</p>
        <p>At about 3:30 P.M., when the baking streets are overflowing, Palestinian Authority police suddenly descend on an apartment building. Someone shoots from inside, and within minutes the street is a mass of screaming humanity, with excited children underfoot. As the sound of sirens fills fetid side streets, the people alternately harangue the police and flee in panic as officers fire into the air.</p>
        <p>After two hours, Hamas leaders summoned by the police succeed in negotiating the surrender of a 23-year-old Hamas member named Wael Nassar and two comrades. There are only injuries, no deaths.</p>
        <p>Israel proclaims the catch a big one. For 10 days, the Israeli Army has kept Gaza totally sealed off, based on information that Mr. Nassar had prepared a farewell videotape and was about to leave on a suicide mission inside Israel.</p>
        <p>Inside Gaza, the arrest is little more than street theater. Word circulates that Mr. Nassar agreed to surrender when the Palestinian Authority promised to release him after a few weeks.</p>
        <p>Three days later, a suicide bomber strikes in Jerusalem. In Gazan streets, that means only one thing -- that the border will be sealed again. This time, the bomber is soon identified as a West Bank resident, and the checkpoint is opened to Arabs again.</p>
        <p>But there is another hurdle. Israel has announced that all Gazans entering Israel will need a new magnetic identification card -- the old ones, it seems, can be forged. The new ones are in Hebrew only -- another reminder, the Arabs grumble, that self-rule is hardly independence.</p>
        <p>Lines at the Erez checkpoint form at dawn for the new cards, but by closing time at 2 P.M. thousands of Gazans are still waiting for cards to be issued. Horns blare, voices rise, and Palestinian police move in to clear the checkpoint for the day.</p>
        <p>"I've never seen anything good in this place, either in the era of the Jews or in the era" of the Palestinian Authority, said Sami Zin-Eldir, 33. "If I was asked before I was born whether I wanted to be born here, I'd definitely have said no."</p>
        <p>His companion, Bashir Nashwan, 33, whose Gaza photo shop depends entirely on supplies he buys in Israel, said: "We expected that things would improve. But everything we dreamed of we've lost -- freedom to travel, to export and import, jobs. We live in a prison."</p>
        <p>The image of a prison recurs in every conversation. "We are in a big jail here," said Nasser R. Sarraj, the Minister of Industry in the Palestinian Authority. "We stopped the killing, we stopped the shooting, but we lose the right even to go to the West Bank. I am a Government Minister, and I can't go to Jericho."</p>
        <p>Jericho, in the West Bank, came under the administration of the Palestinian Authority at the same time as Gaza. But even Mr. Arafat cannot commute between the two by land or in his own helicopter. He travels on an Egyptian plane that follows a circuitous route that Israelis insist is necessary for their security.</p>
        <p>The Israeli explanation is "security," always "security." It is for reasons of security that more than 50,000 Palestinian workers have been replaced inside Israel by imported Romanians and Thais, that one-third of Gaza's cramped land is settled by Israelis and ringed with electric fences and soldiers, that the crossing points have been closed for almost half of the days that Gaza has known self-rule.</p>
        <p>Compelling as the need for security may seem when a bus explodes in a quiet Jerusalem neighborhood, the consequences are hard to understand for people who have lived through the humiliation of occupation, the daily violence of the intifada and the menial jobs in Israel to provide sustenance.</p>
        <p>By all accounts, the border closings have become the single most damaging aspect of life under self-rule. When they are imposed, the 16,800 workers who do have permits to work in Israel are sealed in, goods are blocked, travelers miss flights, and the claustrophobia builds. The dependence on Israel is so complete that, according to the United Nations, losses during a closing amount to between $1 million and $2 million a day in Gaza.</p>
        <p>"Closures are the biggest problem we have," said Marwan Kanafani, Mr. Arafat's spokesman.</p>
        <p>Referring to the period of self-rule under the agreement with Israel, he said that, "Two hundred of the 450 days we've had freedom in Gaza have been closure days. This is a catastrophe. For 200 days, workers stay at home, they don't buy food, grocery stores stop working, the whole economic cycle stops. This encourages extremists who say that peace has brought nothing.</p>
        <p>"The entire homeland of Gaza is held hostage. We did not sign this agreement to be kept like animals behind bars." Potential Cautious Optimism For Gaza's Growth</p>
        <p>Sami Mourtaga runs a bottling plant that employs 85 workers and normally does a thriving business selling cola and orange soda. But Mr. Mourtaga's cola syrup comes from Ireland, the orange syrup from Austria, the carbon dioxide gas for carbonation from Israel, and everything goes through Erez.</p>
        <p>During the last big closing, the supplies ran out and his workers sat idle for a month. When the border opened, he lost another month when Israelis insisted that the gas -- like all other wares -- be transferred from Israeli to Gazan trucks, though no appropriate truck was available in Gaza. "They make life much more complicated than it needs to be," Mr. Mourtaga said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mourtaga said the business he and his brothers run is one of about 50,000, big and small, making a go of it in Gaza. "On balance, I guess things have become better for us," he said. "I'm an optimist -- I have to be, there's no other way. Israel will change. It knows that it's good for Israel for Gaza to succeed."</p>
        <p>But even in the most optimistic development scenarios, Gaza can never hope to create enough work for a population that is not only huge, but expanding at a dizzying rate. With as many as a million people packed into the 147 square miles of the Band-Aid-shaped Strip, Gaza has one of the world's highest population densities. And more than half of Gazans are under age 16, so even if no more expatriate Palestinians return, the population is expected to double in 17 years. It could expand out of control if there is another crisis like the Persian Gulf war, which sent 250,000 Palestinians flooding back into Gaza.</p>
        <p>"Gaza makes no sense from an economic point of view," said Robert M. Gallagher, the deputy United Nations Special Coordinator in the Occupied Territories. "Ultimately there has to be a regional solution."</p>
        <p>Economic planners see the construction of a port and an airport as critical to giving Gaza an outlet to the world independent of Israel. But the bottom line is still whether Israel will feel secure enough in the near future to let Palestinians work there again in large numbers. Progress Learning Process Shaping Self-Rule</p>
        <p>Despite the hardships, there is evidence that Mr. Arafat has begun making progress in his leadership after a shaky start. He is still criticized for cronyism in his appointments, for his bullying militias, for flaws in the agreement he struck with Israel.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Arafat is given credit for actually living in Gaza most of the time, which nobody thought he would, and for bringing a modicum of security. And little by little, his administration is learning the ropes.</p>
        <p>"There are a lot of things that went wrong at first, that satisfied us neither as an authority nor as people," Mr. Kanafani acknowledged. "We had no experience, no means. But we have learned a lot."</p>
        <p>One problem facing the Palestinian Authority is that the Israelis did precious little for Gaza in the 27 years of their occupation. United Nations officials said that Gaza's development actually retrogressed in those years -- water resources were channeled to Israeli settlers, medical services were neglected, any sign of political activity was blocked, and construction permits were used as a tool of power, to be swapped for collaboration.</p>
        <p>"As an occupation power, Israel was not interested in developing services here," said Dr. Hatem Abu Ghazaleh, who organized a center for handicapped children in 1975. "They didn't want us to develop our own services. They didn't differentiate between humane and nonhumane services, it made no difference whether it was a bank or a society for the handicapped."</p>
        <p>By most accounts, Hamas has lost ground since the Israelis pulled out, less because of its militant anti-Israeli stance than because most Gazans are happy to be able to stroll on the beach or watch a Western movie, and are not prepared to let Islamic zealots deny them the small pleasures of peace.</p>
        <p>Hamas is aware that it would lose in a head-to-head confrontation with Mr. Arafat, who controls most of the arms in Gaza and has already imprisoned several Hamas leaders. After the last two bus bombings, Hamas deliberately avoided linking the attacks to territories under Mr. Arafat's control in order not to provoke him.</p>
        <p>There is also no serious doubt here that Mr. Arafat will win when elections are finally held for the Palestinian Authority. Hamas leaders said they had not decided yet whether to participate.</p>
        <p>Sitting in a beachfront cafe late one night, Imad el-Falouji, a soft-spoken and scholarly man who is one of the main political leaders of Hamas inside Gaza, spoke of the movement's options.</p>
        <p>Mr. Falouji studied in Kharkov, in Soviet Ukraine, where he spent seven months in jail for propagating Islam among Central Asian students. On his return he spent another four years in an Israeli prison during the intifada before he returned to Gaza. Yet Mr. Falouji is not among the Hamas leaders threatened with arrest; he meets often with the Palestinian Authority, and the police asked him to mediate after the shootout in the Sheik Radwan neighborhood.</p>
        <p>"Nobody can understand Arafat," he said. "Sometimes our relations are good, sometimes bad. Now they're not so good -- he has arrested our leaders, killed our people. But we totally reject war with him. Totally."</p>
        <p>Hamas's conflict was with Israel, not Mr. Arafat, Mr. Falouji said. "Israel does not want peace. It wants security, and we hold the key to that. And if they want their security, they have to listen to us. This is not peace yet."</p>
