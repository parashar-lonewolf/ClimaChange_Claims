        <p>Discussions about carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases linked to global warming have so far focused on two strategies: President Bush's policy of slowing growth in emissions through volunteerism, and the Kyoto Protocol, a treaty embraced by almost all other industrialized countries that would require prompt cuts.</p>
        <p>But last week, signs emerged in Moscow and Washington that these approaches are just the outer bounds of a broader debate. Experts said the subtle shifts in thinking could point to an eventual common framework for dealing with global warming.</p>
        <p>The treaty has stalled. It needs only ratification by Russia to take effect, but President Vladimir V. Putin said Russia would take whatever time is necessary to judge the risks and benefits. European officials expressed dismay. But experts tracking climate diplomacy said Mr. Putin's view reflected rising general unease over the pact's challenging terms.</p>
        <p>In Washington, Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican, announced adjustments to an emissions-cutting bill co-authored with Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Connecticut Democrat.</p>
        <p>The bill originally contained a timetable that, while far gentler than that in the Kyoto pact, was strongly opposed by industries wedded to coal and oil, which emit carbon dioxide when burned. The new version is gentler yet and could gain support.</p>
        <p>But many experts added that any future framework must eventually be far broader, and also include big developing countries like China and India, which are predicted to be the dominant source of carbon dioxide within a decade or two -- and are not encompassed in any significant way by the Bush policy or the Kyoto treaty.</p>
