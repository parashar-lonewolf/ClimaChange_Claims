        <p>LEAD: Michael S. Dukakis breathed the crisp mountain air this morning, strolled along a spectacular alpine lake and climbed atop rocks for a better view of snow-capped Rocky Mountain peaks.</p>
        <p>Michael S. Dukakis breathed the crisp mountain air this morning, strolled along a spectacular alpine lake and climbed atop rocks for a better view of snow-capped Rocky Mountain peaks.</p>
        <p>''If anybody wants to know why it's fun to run for the Presidency of the United States,'' the Massachusetts Governor said, ''this is the answer.''</p>
        <p>More important, however, it made for great pictures.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Dukakis, the prospective Democratic Presidential nominee, a visit to the Rocky Mountain National Park before returning tonight to Boston was a fitting final stop on a seven-state tour through Southwestern, Western and mountain states.</p>
        <p>It was a trip in which image prevailed over substance: the Governor's ride on a tugboat in Tacoma, Wash., on Saturday probably drew more public attention than a speech he gave decrying the fact that the nation needs economic renewal.</p>
        <p>On his last campaign swing before the Democratic National Convention begins in Atlanta on July 18, Mr. Dukakis stressed economic themes, offering few specifics beyond a vision of an America where full employment can be realized.</p>
        <p>Today, for example, he called for protecting the nation's parks as well as national standards to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions that contribute to acid rain.</p>
        <p>''In fact,'' Mr. Dukakis said, ''our economic future is bound up in our environmental future.''  A Hint of Irritation</p>
        <p>If the recent barrage of complaints by the Rev. Jesse Jackson or his supporters about the Vice-Presidential selection process and the Democratic platform were an irritant to Mr. Dukakis, he gave no hint of that. Until today.</p>
        <p>Asked at a news conference if the Chicago civil rights leader should finally concede the Democratic nomination, since Mr. Dukakis has garnered enough delegates to get the nomination, the Governor replied:</p>
        <p>''Jesse Jackson can do whatever he wants to do. I'm going to the convention, and I'm going to win.''</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Jackson's qualms over the platform, Mr. Dukakis said:</p>
        <p>''This is a large party made up of literally hundreds of thousands of people who are participating in this effort. If people want to go to that convention and debate certain issues, they are free to do so. That's what democracy is all about.''  New Place, Same Question</p>
        <p>The three-day trip through Texas, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Oregon, Washington and Colorado found Mr. Dukakis besieged at every stop with questions about his search for a running mate.</p>
        <p>Even on his tugboat ride in the Tacoma harbor, reporters trailing him in another tugboat shouted, ''What about the Vice President?''</p>
        <p>As usual, he provided no answer.  A Favorite Subject</p>
        <p>One person Mr. Dukakis felt free to mention was Vice President Bush, his presumed Republican rival in November.</p>
        <p>In recent days, the Governor has accused the Vice President of deluding the public by saying he would not raise taxes, even though he endorsed a newly approved catastrophic health insurance plan. Under the plan, Medicare beneficiaries must pay for premiums, as well as a surtax on their Federal income taxes.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Bush insists he favors no new taxes, Mr. Dukakis today stepped up his attack.</p>
        <p>''I'm for the bill,'' he said of the health plan. ''But I want the Vice President to stand up and tell the truth, which is that he and the President support a $6 billion tax increase to pay for needed health insurance for the elderly in this country.''  Patience, Patience</p>
        <p>The audiences at Mr. Dukakis's appearances on this trip were often thin, and attentive, if not enthusiastic.</p>
        <p>But he continually reminds his listeners that, in the 1960 Presidential campaign, the public initially was not enthralled with John F. Kennedy.</p>
        <p>Mayor Charles Royer of Seattle, who supports Mr. Dukakis, agrees.</p>
        <p>''I don't worry that people aren't tearing their hair out to get next to the guy,'' said Mr. Royer, who accompanied Mr. Dukakis on his tour of the Port of Tacoma. ''And they're not.</p>
        <p>''But I think you're going to get to the debates and you're going to see a real turnaround in attitude toward him. He'll warm up considerably.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Royer made these comments, by the way, after hearing Mr. Dukakis deliver perhaps his best-received speech of the three-day trip.</p>
