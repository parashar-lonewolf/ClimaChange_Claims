        <p>Obviously, America's formal participation in global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is essential for the Kyoto treaty to succeed. But heaping praise on Canada's prime minister for publicly rebuking the United States for its ''shameful foot-dragging'' seems to be misplaced when, in reality, Canada's greenhouse gas emissions have increased some 24 percent since 1990.</p>

        <p>Obviously, America's formal participation in global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is essential for the Kyoto treaty to succeed. But heaping praise on Canada's prime minister for publicly rebuking the United States for its ''shameful foot-dragging'' seems to be misplaced when, in reality, Canada's greenhouse gas emissions have increased some 24 percent since 1990.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Paul Martin tried to cash in on the Canadian electorate's perceived anti-Americanism by going out of his way to use former President Bill Clinton at the Montreal meeting as a political prop to demonstrate his toughness on the current White House for failing to support the Kyoto accord. This said more about the political opportunism of Mr. Martin than it did about the global conscience of the United States.</p>
        <p>While an embarrassed Mr. Clinton proved a class act, sadly it made Canada and an electioneering Canadian prime minister look cheap before a world audience.</p>
