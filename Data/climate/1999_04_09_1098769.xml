        <p>Sunlight gleamed off the water in the fountain in Bryant Park. The weather was unusually warm for April and Lilu Wilis, sitting nearby, was of good cheer.

        <p>Sunlight gleamed off the water in the fountain in Bryant Park. The weather was unusually warm for April and Lilu Wilis, sitting nearby, was of good cheer. ''I came here to get a tan and to get splashed,'' said Ms. Wilis, a 23-year-old assistant office manager. ''It's just beautiful!''</p>

        <p>After a string of recent sunny days in the 60's and low 70's, yesterday's peak of 80 degrees was uncommonly balmy, even by the standards of usually jaded meteorologists. ''Ah, spring is in the air,'' said George McKillop, a meteorologist in the National Weather Service forecast office in Brookhaven, on Long Island.  Yesterday's high was 21 degrees above normal for New York City, he said, but short of the record high for April 8, 90 degrees set in 1991 (the record low was 25 in 1982). The highest temperature in the Northeast yesterday was 83 in Newark and the highest temperature in the nation was 97 in McAllen, Tex., near the Mexican border.</p>
        <p>A weather system characterized by low atmospheric pressure migrated out of the Great Lakes region into upstate New York Wednesday night, Mr. McKillop said, followed by high pressure, usually an indicator of clear skies. ''That's where the nice weather is coming from,'' he said.</p>
        <p>No such luck today, though. A low-pressure center and cold front, weatherspeak for likely showers, is slowly moving east from Missouri and should reach New York in time for the Yankees' home opener this afternoon, Mr. McKillop said. ''It's hard to say whether the game will get rained out,'' he said. ''Unfortunately, it does linger on. It's no quick in-and-outer.''</p>
        <p>The warm temperatures yesterday were a little early for April, which is usually known for rain. Most 80-degree days hit much later in the month, said Stephen S. Fybish, 62, an elementary school teacher and amateur weather historian who lives in Manhattan. In 1996, he pointed out, the temperature soared to 85 degrees, but by then it was April 23.</p>
        <p>The warmer spring follows one of the warmest winters on record for the Northeast and New York City in particular, said Mr. McKillop of the Weather Service. At 38.7 degrees for Central Park, it was the fourth warmest winter on record, compared with the record of 40.1 for the winter of 1931-32.</p>
        <p>Ominously, for those looking for evidence of global warming, the third and second warmest winters both occurred in the 1990's -- 39.2 in 1990-91 and 39.6 in 1997-98.</p>
        <p>That, of course, does not preclude the freak snow storm. Mr. McKillop noted that he worked for several hours yesterday in his back yard in East Quogue, clearing away two 20-foot evergreen trees that had collapsed during a severe snow storm March 15. ''Now that was kind of freaky,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Fybish warned that anything is possible in April, even for the Yankees' opening home game. In the 1996 opener, he noted, ''Andy Pettitte had to wipe away snowflakes from his eyes so he could pitch.''</p>
