        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Larry Ephron's July 25 letter, suggesting that a consequence of the greenhouse effect might be the hastening of an ice age, rather than the commonly accepted global heat wave, brings to mind a television program nearly 30 years old.</p>
        <p>In a ''Twilight Zone'' episode called ''The Midnight Sun,'' Rod Serling painted a picture of an earth that has spun out of its orbit, moving closer to the sun and growing hotter every day. The episode focuses on a young artist, who is struggling to survive in the sweltering heat, even as her thermometer bursts and her canvases melt. She finally collapses from the intense heat.</p>
        <p>When she awakes, she sees icicles forming on the window and snow flurries outside. Believing she has simply been through a dream, she is much relieved. The doctor who is attending her discusses her condition with the landlady, saying finally he can do nothing more because he is taking his family to a southern climate where there is still some heat left. The ironic twist in ''The Midnight Sun'' is that the woman's dream - or nightmare - of intense heat is apparently a reaction to the reality of an oncoming ice age.</p>
        <p>Such, too, is the picture painted by Mr. Ephron. Regardless of whether the greenhouse effect is simply causing a global warming trend, or whether the pole-equator disparities will hasten an ice age, as Mr. Ephron suggests, it is clear we musst take all steps within our power to minimize jthe greenhouse effect as rapidly as possible.</p>
        <p>The ''Twilight Zone'' episode is, of course, only one more piece of evi-dence that there is nothing new under the sun. COREY L. GORDON  St. Paul, July 25, 1988</p>
