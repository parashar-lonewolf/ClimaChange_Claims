        <p>The Persian Gulf war has caused an ecological calamity affecting a large chunk of Asia, and experts say it might take years to clean up.</p>
        <p>At least three separate slicks containing millions of gallons of crude oil have coated swaths of the Kuwaiti and Saudi coastline, killing marine life and threatening the commercial shrimp and fishing industries that are an important element of the economies of several gulf states.</p>
        <p>Dense, dark smoke from more than 600 burning oil wells in Kuwait hangs in a stinking, soupy pall over cities and farmland from Turkey to Iran, with predictions that plumes could reach northern India. The fires have spewed tons of toxic chemicals into the air, prompting doctors to gear up for respiratory illnesses and farmers to fear for crops tainted by greasy rains washing cancer-causing particles from the sky.</p>
        <p>"The ecology of the Persian Gulf is hurting pretty badly right now," said William R. Moomaw, director of the Center for Environmental Management at Tufts University. "The level of air pollution from the burning oil wells exceeds by hundreds of times the most polluted areas of the world." Ecologists Could Only Watch</p>
        <p>For the most part, environmentalists have watched the fouling unfold from the sidelines of a restricted war zone. With hostilities ending, cleanup specialists are rushing to stem the fires and scoop up what remains of the spills.</p>
        <p>But many of the oil wells now ablaze produce by natural pressure, not by mechanical pumps, and are extremely difficult and dangerous to extinguish. Some experts said that each of the fires could take at least two weeks' work to extinguish, and with only a handful of companies trained in this kind of work, it could be a year or two before all the fires are out.</p>
        <p>The outlook is equally gloomy at sea, where smoke from the burning wells and the danger of floating mines has hampered efforts by spotter planes to map the oil spills and dispatch oil-skimming ships to suck them up.</p>
        <p>Only about 5.4 million gallons have been recovered from the main spill, which the Saudis originally estimated to be 450 million gallons. Between 66 million and 250 million gallons are still floating, with the remainder having evaporated, sunk in a suffocating mantle over coral reefs, or washed ashore onto mud flats and marshes that serve as habitats for scores of species.  Spills Abound</p>
        <p>Southerly winds have stalled the advancing spill at the tiny island of Abu Ali, 25 miles north of the Saudi town of Jubail, where the world's largest desalting plant is located. Workers have placed double and triple layers of floating booms around the plant's intake pipes to try to keep the oil out. But some experts fear that toxic chemicals dissolved in the seawater could force the plant to close, cutting off the main source of fresh water for eastern Saudi Arabia and the capital, Riyadh.</p>
        <p>Two smaller spills carrying millions of gallons of oil -- one floating about 45 miles north of Jubail and another in the center of the northern Gulf -- promise to tax recovery efforts.</p>
        <p>"The environmental damage is very serious," said Abdullah Dabbagh, research director at the King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals in Dhahran. "What we need most is more people to go out and remove the oil."</p>
        <p>At risk in the gulf is an abundance of wildlife, including 180 species of mollusks, 106 species of fish, 450 species of animals that live in the chain of coral reefs, five species of dolphins, at least three types of whales and scores of different sea birds.</p>
        <p>Although its coastline is largely undeveloped, the gulf's high salinity, relatively shallow waters and steady traffic of oil tankers, which frequently discharge their oily ballast into the sea, have made survival a challenge for most marine life.</p>
        <p>"The ecosystem in the gulf has been stressed out for decades," said Thomas M. Miller, a spokesman for the Center for Marine Conservation in Washington. "There are species living on the brink now and it won't take much to push them over."</p>
        <p>Considering the Persian Gulf's counterclockwise currents and the three years it takes for water to flush through the narrow Strait of Hormuz, coastal experts fear that oil remaining on the surface will harm the gulf's east and west coasts.</p>
        <p>The spill in the northern gulf, which United States Coast Guard pilots noticed last week, poses a serious threat to several coral reefs and breeding grounds for sea turtles, Mr. Dabbagh said.</p>
        <p>Little is known about the exact size of the slicks, largely because they are in waters that have been off-limits to researchers, Dr. Dabbagh said.</p>
        <p>After weeks of delay and confusion among rival Saudi agencies, the cleanup received a boost recently when the state-owned oil conglomerate, Saudi Aramco, assumed control of coordinating the response from another agency, the Meteorology and Environmental Protection Administration.</p>
        <p>The company is moving quickly to review a range of cleanup methods, from solvents derived from orange rind to highly absorbent wool booms from New Zealand to oil-eating bacteria created in France.</p>
        <p>The oil fouls only a portion of the gulf, but from virtually any point along the coastal region, the dark billowing clouds of noxious smoke are unmistakable. A visitor to Kuwait City on Thursday was greeted with pitch-black skies at 2 P.M. Cars drove with headlights on and some residents carried flashlights to find the nearest celebration of the Iraqi defeat.</p>
        <p>Reports from Baghdad said a sepulchral fog shrouded the city for much of last week and dirty clouds strung across the skies of western Iran for nearly 900 milies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moomaw said the clouds contain large quantities of sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide and other hydrocarbons. If the concentrations persisted, he said that infants, the elderly and people with respiratory problems could be harmed.  Long-Term Effects Unknown</p>
        <p>The governor of Adana state in Turkey, Birsin Ozen, ordered residents this week not to use rainwater or let their animals drink it.</p>
        <p>Since there is no precedent for burning this much oil, estimated by industry officials at three to five million barrels a day, in a relatively confined area, no one knows what the longterm environmental effects will be.</p>
        <p>"We have never had more than four or five wells burning at a time, so this is of a magnitude unknown in modern times," said Michael S. Clark, president of Friends of the Earth, a Washington-based environmental group.</p>
        <p>In a year, the burning oil in the gulf could produce about three million tons of sulfur, a principal component of acid rain, according to the Worldwatch Institute based in Washington.</p>
        <p>Most scientists say it is unlikely that the fires would have a global impact on the climate by darkening skies sufficiently to lower temperatures worldwide.</p>
        <p>But there could be a serious problem of cooling and rainfall disruption for farmers in Iran and the Indian subcontinent. In a report issued in January, the British Government's meteorological office said soot-induced cooling could reduce the monsoon rains critical to agriculture in the region.</p>
        <p>"It could have dire consequences for Southwest Asia and food production there," said Prof. Alan Robock, a meteorologist at the University of Maryland.</p>
