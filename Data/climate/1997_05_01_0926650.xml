        <p>THE Victorians were the first to hate Victorian architecture. With one major exception, they detested their own buildings. The exception was the great glass greenhouse. The conservatory, the winter garden, the Crystal Palace: this type of building Victorians passionately admired.</p>
        <p>So do we. On Saturday, the magnificent Enid A. Haupt Conservatory, the glittering glass centerpiece of the New York Botanical Garden, reopens after a restoration that took four years and cost $25 million, of which probably not one penny was spent on Windex. This beautiful glass bubble, completed in 1902, is the largest building of its type in America, and one of the finest in the world.</p>
        <p>Many today can appreciate Victorian architecture's full range. Its contorted madness mirrors our own with a fidelity that few living architects even want to aim for. The greenhouse, however, appeals to us, as it did to the Victorians, as a place of rare sanity. It is calm, reasoned, elegant and scientific. It is the seed crystal from which modern architecture eventually took shape.</p>
        <p>Restored by the New York architectural firm of Beyer Blinder Belle, the Haupt Conservatory can once again hold its sparkling glass head up high amid the great architectural symbols of New York. The building has long been one of the few landmarks outside Manhattan routinely depicted in stylized renderings of the city's skyline. The Yankees may be unhappy in the Bronx, but palm trees like it just fine.</p>
        <p>The Victorians put curtains on their curtains and in polite company refrained from referring to the pieces of wood that support a piano as ''legs.'' So you can imagine the breathless ecstasy with which they embraced any excuse for beholding a building of pure transparency and its proudly nude light metal structure. This was almost as intoxicating as glimpsing an ankle.</p>
        <p>The restoration should enable us to see this building type afresh. Beyer Blinder Belle has recovered its light, airy beauty. Visitors must peer deeper to see the conservatory's historical roots. In no way is this building an example of quaint Victoriana -- a sort of palm court without tea. It is, rather, a cornerstone of modernity. As Georg Kohlmaier and Barna von Sartory observe in their encyclopedic 1986 book, ''Houses of Glass'' (M.I.T. Press), the greenhouse was integral to the culture of the machine. ''The prerequisite for the development of technology and science in the industrial age,'' they write, ''was the practical exploitation of nature in such a way that natural processes could be understood and controlled and could be called upon whenever needed.''</p>
        <p>The greenhouse expressed that need practically and symbolically. Here, plants could be studied scientifically, while the conservatory as a whole represented the mastery of modern science over nature. It fed the 19th-century rage for classification, widening the gulf between nature and culture even as it brought the two together under one roof.</p>
        <p>The conservatory was also a response to the social tensions of the industrial city. Like the public park, the winter garden was an instrument of social reform. At a time when agricultural workers were flocking to the city in search of freedom, the city provided freedom in the form of an artificial version of the countryside they had left behind. The greenhouse was a wholesome, alternative form of escapism, designed for people who otherwise sought relief in taverns, dance halls and other depraved urban delights.</p>
        <p>Gregory Long, the botanical garden's president, suggested on a recent tour that the Victorian conservatory was also nurtured by England's imperial expansion. Plants were collected from parts of the world colonized by the British. Just as Japanese gardens were often laid out as miniature versions of Japan, so the conservatory enclosed a microcosm of the British Empire. The display of tropical plants expressed something far more serious than a taste for the exotic. It also denoted pride in ownership, or, to put it more politely, in the long, committed reach of England's civilizing mission.</p>
        <p>I F the Victorians exempted greenhouses from their low architectural esteem, that is partly because they did not regard them as architecture at all. Rather, they were structures produced by the extension of gardening into the scientific realm of engineering. Their emphasis was on function. As John Summerson noted, the designs of greenhouse designers like Joseph Paxton were ''unstigmatized by style.'' Like railway sheds and iron bridges, they stood apart from the stylistic debates between classicists and gothicists, ancients and moderns.</p>
        <p>As such, the greenhouse came to exert great influence over architects who sought a proper style of building for the industrial age. The immense popularity of the Crystal Palace, designed by Paxton for the first world's fair, held in London's Hyde Park in 1851, offered the hope that glass architecture could serve people as well as it did plants.</p>
        <p>In due course, it did. The glass office tower, the canonical expression of 20th-century modernism, is a vertical form of the greenhouse made possible by steel and the elevator. The skyscraper's prefabricated modular construction, glass walls and open interior all descend directly from greenhouse design.</p>
        <p>And in its own oblique way, the glass tower was also an imperial gesture. As the paradigm of the ''International Style,'' it was the premier architectural symbol of global corporate culture, an emblem of power that continues to transform skylines around the world. It, too, represents mastery over nature, and culture as well. Total air-conditioning. Total homogenization. Total 24-hour club sandwich, with stale chips and tepid coffee.</p>
        <p>O UR notion of mastery differs from that of the Victorians. It is emotional, not scientific, a fluctuation between pity and fear. Isn't it a shame that we're destroying the rain forest! Look out for that virus!</p>
        <p>Much as we depend on that mastery, we don't quite want to take responsibility for it. The restoration has given us back a historic landmark, but in the years separating us from the Victorians, our relationship to nature has profoundly changed. What we seek to conserve now is not individual plants, transplanted from their native habitats, but rather nature itself.</p>
        <p>We don't take great pride in global ownership. We are rather embarrassed about it, in fact. We know that our mastery has attained such extremes that Australian children must now wear hats on their way to school because the depleted ozone layer makes their skin vulnerable to cancer. We bow down less eagerly to science, even though our physical and intellectual survival remains dependent on it, because our well-being has been brutally assaulted by so many scientific breakthroughs.</p>
        <p>One is reminded of this, if any reminder were necessary, by the broadcasting antenna being erected by Fordham University outside the Botanical Garden's walls. It has been argued that, if one counts oneself a defender of the modern, one is not entitled to criticize this conspicuously mechanical sign of progress.</p>
        <p>Wrong. The modern idea is that society should channel technology toward human ends in the light of increasing awareness. Modernity rests on the multiple perspective. Your neighbor's point of view counts for something important, that is to say. In this sense, Fordham's tower is not only unmodern. It is prehistorically territorial. Law of the jungle. Me big major university. You weak little green plant. Uga uga uga.</p>
        <p>Horticulture, in other words, is a major part of culture, never more so than today, when life itself is contingent on cultural values. The conservatory has come to represent an ideal very nearly the opposite of its original intention. It now stands as a symbol not of triumph but of impending catastrophe, brought about by the same forces that coaxed the greenhouse into being. And we cannot be certain, as we walk along its immensely inspiring paths, whether our steps are taking us closer to the apocalypse or helping us to resist it.</p>
