        <p>IN a burst of new discoveries, climatologists are beginning to reconstruct a recurring cycle of events that changed the face of the world several times during the last great ice age.</p>
        <p>Each of the proposed new cycles seems to have included the buildup of a North American ice sheet whose central region was two miles thick; a series of warming fluctuations in the world's temperature, followed by the breakup of the ice sheet into armadas of icebergs that invaded the North Atlantic. These cycles occurred at least five times during the last ice age, which lasted 100,000 years and ended some 10,000 years ago.</p>
        <p>In a picture that came together at a recent meeting of the American Geophysical Union, geologists and others reported finding many different fingerprints of the cycles in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.</p>
        <p>One of the earliest clues to these great events came in 1988 with the discovery of six layers of tiny stones in cores drilled through the ooze on the bottom of the North Atlantic. The researcher, Hartmut Heinrich of the German Hydrographic Institute in Hamburg, had studied 13 cores of bottom sediment extracted from under 13,000 feet of water from a small area west of France. The same six layers occurred in most of them and were, he thought, dropped by armadas of icebergs from Canada.</p>
        <p>Before they broke off from the continental ice the icebergs had scraped up rocky debris from land beneath the ice, then deposited it as "dropstones" when melted over this spot.</p>
        <p>That icebergs sometimes drifted this far did not seem very remarkable, but now layers with identical composition and spacing have been found at a dozen sites spanning the entire Atlantic from Labrador to Europe. They testify to great armadas of icebergs that in intervals some 5,000 to 10,000 years apart, suddenly invaded the ocean in vast numbers.</p>
        <p>The sites are confined to a broad zone that presumably marks the drift path of the icebergs from the Labrador Sea southeast to the latitude of Portugal. Sea floor sampling north as well as south of that path has failed to show evidence of the "Heinrich events," as these iceberg invasions are now called.</p>
        <p>The Heinrich events have turned out to occur in step with other ice age cycles. One of these is a series of sudden warmings in climate, indicated by the ratio between two oxygen isotopes in the annual layers of snow packed into the Greenland icecap. The ice core data have shown that every 500 to 2,000 years during the last ice age the climate apparently warmed abruptly, then gradually cooled back to full ice age conditions.</p>
        <p>These warming phases have been named Dansgaard-Oeschger events, after Dr. Willi Dansgaard of Denmark and Dr. Hans Oeschger of Switzerland, who helped identify them.</p>
        <p>That these events may have also have been felt in the Antarctic has been reported by Dr. Todd Sowers of the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University and Dr. Michael Bender of the University of Rhode Island. They believe they have found nine such sudden warmings in the temperature record preserved in ice extracted by the Russians from their deep drill hole at Vostok. But efforts to date them have been imprecise because the annual layers there are too thin to count.</p>
        <p>A second type of cyclic event was a series of warmings discovered by Dr. Gerard Bond and others at the Lamont observatory. Their ice age thermometer was a species of plankton that lives on the surface of the ocean and indicates temperature by its abundance. From the fossil skeletons of organisms buried in sediment on the floor of the North Atlantic Ocean, they identified a series of warmings that correspond remarkably closely with the Dansgaard-Oeschger warmings found in the Greenland ice cores.  Link With Heinrich Events</p>
        <p>Dr. Bond noted that at the end of each series of increasingly intense warmings there was a Heinrich event, the extensive release of icebergs into the Atlantic. One of his colleagues named these series Bond cycles, of which there seem to have been at least five during the last ice age.</p>
        <p>In the current issue of Science, five American and French scientists warn against excessive reliance on oxygen isotopes in Greenland ice as clues to sudden warmings. They said computer simulations showed that the abundance of those isotopes could have also been controlled by wind changes that suddenly brought in warm air from distant sources like the North Pacific.</p>
        <p>"Implications for future climate," they wrote, could only be assessed by understanding the combination of factors responsible for past sudden changes. The authors were Dr. Christopher D. Charles of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California, Dr. David Rind of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City, where the simulations were done, Dr. Jean Jouzel of the French laboratory at Saclay, Dr. Randal D. Koster of the NASA center in Greenbelt, Md., and Dr. Richard G. Fairbanks of the Lamont observatory.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, many pieces of evidence now seem to fit together around the Bond cycles and the Heinrich events that terminate them. They seem to have been global phenomena, even though their cause and mechanism are far from understood.  Evidence of warming periods has now been found all over the globe, from sediment beneath a Florida lake to the glaciers of Chile and New Zealand and the sea floor sediment off Western South America. These findings indicate that the cycle affected the Pacific as well as the North Atlantic.</p>
        <p>The report of effects on glaciers in southern Chile and the Southern Alps of New Zealand was widely discussed at the December meeting of the American Geophysical Union in the San Francisco. The findings had been made by Dr. George Denton of the University of Maine in Orono and a colleague, Dr. Thomas Rowell of the University of Cincinnati in Ohio. They found that glaciers there seemed to have advanced and retreated in synchrony with the Heinrich events.  Movement of Ice Sheet</p>
        <p>Another phenomenon that waxed and waned, perhaps in the same synchrony, was the great North American ice sheet. The movements of its southern front can be traced by the piles of stones, known as moraines, that were left by each advance of the melting ice. The evidence from the moraines is that the glacier's front wavered to and fro, intermittently reaching down to sites from the Midwest to New York and New England.</p>
        <p>At its greatest advance it reached the center line of Long Island, where it left a rocky ridge known as the Ronkonkoma moraine, upon which much of the Long Island Expressway has been built. The moraine, according to Dr. Les Serkin of Adelphi University in Garden City, L.I., has been dated at about 21,750 years ago.</p>
        <p>Dating each advance and matching them with the Heinrich events has been difficult, since the moraines left by one may conceal an earlier one. As pointed out by Dr. David M. Michelson of the University of Wisconsin in Madison, the timing of moraines cannot be determined with the accuracy of cores extracted from the sea floor or from an ice sheet. Dating a moraine requires such rare clues as finding in it a carbon-rich item like a buried tree trunk.</p>
        <p>At the December meeting, Dr. Douglas R. MacAyeal of the University of Chicago and Richard B. Alley of Pennsylvania State University proposed an explanation for the sudden, periodic launchings of armadas from Hudson Strait.</p>
        <p>As Dr. MacAyeal said in an interview, every time a "mountain of ice" two miles high formed over Hudson Bay, it became so thick as to block heat escaping from the earth's interior. As a result, the bottom layer of ice melted, as has been found in Antarctica. Such melting could have led to the catastrophic movement of the ice and its calving into armadas of icebergs.</p>
        <p>The Heinrich iceberg armadas followed the same pathway every time. They emerged from Hudson Strait, between Quebec and Baffin Land, then sailed into the Atlantic, carrying fragments of limestone and dolomite that link them to the Hudson Bay region. Lack of Icebergs</p>
        <p>At the San Francisco meeting, Dr. John T. Andrews of the University of Colorado in Boulder reported finding such sediment, presumably in part from Heinrich events, in samples extracted from the floor of the northwest Labrador Sea, along the hypothetical path of the armadas. The ice apparently did not produce icebergs off Long Island, Cape Cod and nearby islands because it never reached the sea, since sea levels had been drastically lowered.</p>
        <p>There is now speculation that ice streams may have also flowed down the valley of the Hudson River, depositing their debris on Staten Island, as well as down the Connecticut Valley, forming the moraines of Long Island, and across Rhode Island to produce Cape Cod and the nearby islands.</p>
        <p>That there were oscillations in the ice front is evident in signs that the terminal moraines formed repeatedly, from Cape Cod to New Jersey.  While most were produced by the last ice age, Dr. Serkin believes some on Block Island and Long Island's Montauk Point are from the previous, or Illinoian, ice age. But in any case Long Island, Block Island, Fishers Island, Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket were all built by such advances and retreats.</p>
        <p>As pointed out by Dr. MacAyeal, the effect on climate of a two-mile-high ice mountain would resemble that of the Himalayas, blocking the warm westerly winds. When the ice subsided, those winds would sweep east unimpeded and the climate would warm. But there is no general agreement on whether this could explain sudden Greenland warmings.</p>
        <p>In 1992, Dr. Bond's colleague, Dr. Wallace Broecker, proposed that the melting of the iceberg armadas might have flooded the ocean with fresh water, disrupting the Gulf Stream and thus chilling the northern climate. Normally, he said, evaporation in the North Atlantic makes the surface water salty and heavy. It sinks and flows south, making room for the warm Gulf Stream to reach the north.</p>
        <p>Dr. Broecker's proposal was widely accepted, and some scientists have proposed that the entire world ocean was affected. But to explain the southern findings, Dr. Broecker now believes other factors may have been involved. One would be variations in the incidence of sunlight, caused by subtle changes in the earth's orbit or of solar output. Another would be a process in the tropics that controls moisture in the atmosphere, explaining findings like rainy periods in Florida and the filling of glacial lakes like Lake Lahontan, which formed during the ice age west of the Rockies.</p>
        <p>The evidence from Florida for temperature changes in phase with the iceberg invasions has been reported in the journal Science by Dr. Eric C. Grimm of the Illinois State Museum in Springfield and co-workers from the Universities of Maine, Minnesota and Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland. They analyzed a thick deposit of sediment under Lake Tulane in Florida that dates back 50,000 years.</p>
        <p>This contains the longest pollen record in North America, showing that Florida vegetation oscillated between wet periods with an abundance of pine and arid times dominated by oak, ragweed and other dry-climate vegetation. The pine forests tended to be abundant during the five most recent Heinrich events.</p>
        <p>The mechanisms that drove the global ice age cycles are a matter of continuing research. When they are understood they should give climatologists a new insight into operation of the world's climate system and factors that may produce such cycles in the future.</p>
