        <p>THE air still tastes gritty, and sometimes it has a slight odor. But air pollution here, as elsewhere in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, has declined since the end of Communist rule.</p>
        <p>What makes the Poles proud, however, is that they have accomplished this not just in Communism's aftermath, when industrial output plunged. When production started to pick up in 1992, after a drop in the previous four years, emissions stayed down.</p>
        <p>The reduction has been managed, Polish experts say, in large part due to investments in desulfurization installations at power plants and a gradual phasing out of small emission sources, like coal-burning stoves and boilers. ''Particularly in the coal mining region of Silesia, emissions went down with the use of better filters and better use of energy,'' said Wojtek Ponikiewski, an environmental expert in Poland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
        <p>And even as the number of cars is growing rapidly in Poland, many of these new cars -- though not enough, environmental critics say -- are fitted with catalytic converters.</p>
        <p>All over Eastern Europe, the quality of the environment has improved since 1989. Dust emissions fell from 1.5 million tons in 1989 to 529,000 tons in 1994; gas emissions dropped from 5.2 million tons to 2.9 million tons; sulfur dioxide emissions declined from 2.8 million tons to 1.7 million tons.</p>
        <p>But the progress is not enough. Poland was severely criticized in a recent report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of industrialized nations. ''Low air quality still poses a threat to human life in Poland's highly industrialized areas,'' the group's report said.</p>
        <p>Poland, anxious to join the European Union, is already under pressure from Western Europe to take drastic steps to cut emissions to meet the tougher standards set by its economically more mature neighbors. But there was no possibility, Mr. Ponikiewski said, that Poland could agree to a  suggestion by the European Union that the world's nations commit to a 15 percent reduction of greenhouse gases, compared with 1990 emission levels, by 2010.</p>
        <p>Even so, the Kyoto conference will add extra pressure. One of the most obvious methods to get emissions reductions is to introduce new taxes on fuel. ''No government wants to do that,'' Mr. Ponikiewski said.</p>
        <p>Poland's environmental groups say there is a way to make progress: cutting back on a plan for a $8 billion superhighway building program and replacing it with mass transit. But, given Poland's new love affair with the car, that is unlikely.</p>
