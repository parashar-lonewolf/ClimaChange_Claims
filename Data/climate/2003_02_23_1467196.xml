        <p>The cast of officials who help to shape President Bush's environmental policies spans a wide range, from a former New Jersey governor whom environmentalists see as their closest ally to a former Colorado attorney general who was a protégé of James Watt, the Reagan-era interior secretary.</p>
        <p>It also includes figures little known to the public, like James L. Connaughton, the chairman of Mr. Bush's Council on Environmental Quality. A Washington lawyer whose practice focused on environmental matters, Mr. Connaughton now acts as Mr. Bush's top White House adviser on the environment, and is a coordinator whose job in part is to referee disputes among the federal agencies.</p>
        <p>Christie Whitman, the former governor turned administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, is the best known among the group, in part because as early as the mid-1990's, her reputation as a rising star in the Republican Party earned her frequent mentions as a potential vice presidential candidate.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman has frequently been overruled by more conservative voices in the administration, most notably over policies on global warming, but she has dashed speculation that she might resign in protest, saying she remains proud of Mr. Bush's environmental record. More recently, she has begun to call attention to fights she has won. For example, she has said that she headed off an effort by others in the administration that could have led to a much broader scaling back of Clean Water Act protections for wetlands.</p>
        <p>Gale A. Norton, the interior secretary, worked under Mr. Watt early in her career, and like him is an ardent champion of the view that the wisest use of public lands includes using them to extract natural resources. As interior secretary, she oversees one-fifth of the territory of the United States -- including, as she pointed out in an interview, the land that produces one-third of the country's energy. She has been the administration's most outspoken advocate for opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling.</p>
        <p>Unlike her mentor, however, Ms. Norton is also an outdoors enthusiast, and she portrays herself as both a conservative and a conservationist.</p>
        <p>''We think we can get beyond the minimum standards enforced by punishment if you actively involve people in becoming citizen stewards,'' Ms. Norton said. ''We really want to see people active in helping our public lands and in encouraging conservation on private lands.''</p>
        <p>The principal players include several others, among them Ann M. Veneman, the agriculture secretary. Ms. Veneman oversees the Forest Service, whose policies on road building, fire prevention and logging have been at the center of several disputes. Another important figure is John D. Graham, a senior official of the Office of Management and Budget with responsibility for federal regulations.</p>
        <p>Though less visible than the others, Mr. Graham has wielded increasing influence by scrutinizing environmental regulations to ensure that the benefits they bring can justify their cost to the American economy. A former Harvard professor, Mr. Graham is seen by environmental groups as a particular threat because his arguments have in the past provided an intellectual rationale for the weakening of environmental regulations.</p>
