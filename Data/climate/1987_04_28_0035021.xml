        <p>LEAD: Faced with growing pressure for action to preserve the earth's ozone shield, the United Nations Environment Program urged a 30-nation conference here today to adopt measures swiftly for eliminating production and use of chlorofluorocarbons by the year 2000.</p>
        <p>Faced with growing pressure for action to preserve the earth's ozone shield, the United Nations Environment Program urged a 30-nation conference here today to adopt measures swiftly for eliminating production and use of chlorofluorocarbons by the year 2000.</p>
        <p>An official of the United Nations program, Dr. Mostafa K. Tolba, in an address to the conference on strengthening the 1985 Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, called for ratification of a protocol to the treaty by next year.</p>
        <p>Dr. Tolba said such a protocol should include a freeze on production and use of the industrial chemicals at 1986 levels by 1990, with a 20 percent reduction each year up to complete elimination by the year 2000.</p>
        <p>Dr. Tolba said he based his recommendation on the findings of a group of scientists gathered by his agency in West Germany earlier this month. The scientists concluded that less stringent measures would lead to significant ozone depletion, increasing pollution and cancers.</p>
        <p>The ozone layer protects the earth from ultraviolent radiation. Chlorofluorocarbons and other industrial chemicals used as solvents, propellants in aerosols, refrigerants, plastic foams and fire extinguishers can interact destructively with the ozone, depleting it.</p>
