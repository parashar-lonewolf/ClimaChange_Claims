        <p>LEAD: What is a Federal Budget: (A) a realistic blueprint from the President for spending and taxes; or (B) the beginning of a poker game with Congress over who gets the credit for spending and the blame for taxes?</p>
        <p>What is a Federal Budget: (A) a realistic blueprint from the President for spending and taxes; or (B) the beginning of a poker game with Congress over who gets the credit for spending and the blame for taxes?</p>
        <p>The usual answer is both, but not this time. The 1988 budget, President Reagan's seventh, is such a pallid, temporizing version of (B) that it's hard to take seriously. The best that can be said about it is that, where it might have been belligerent, it makes modest concessions to the Democrats' new control of both houses of Congress. It's vintage Reagan, only less so.</p>
        <p>After four years of modest growth, for which the President claims immodest credit, his is a sorry vision of what a prosperous nation should provide. He still wants to pump up Pentagon spending, but not so much. He still stands firm against tax increases, but perhaps not quite so firm. He still wants to minimize Government and reduce social spending, but maybe not so tenaciously. Most important, he insists he wants to reduce his huge deficit - but proposes no plausible political strategy to achieve that goal.</p>
        <p>The President is probably correct in saying that the deficit is shrinking, but wrong in calculating how much. Only three months after Congress finished work on the 1987 budget, the deficit will be almost $25 billion larger than previously thought.</p>
        <p>Now, by assuming that the economy will grow faster than most forecasts, Mr. Reagan pretends his plan for fiscal 1988 would yield a smaller deficit than is likely. Moreover, he tosses in ''savings'' that he knows Congress will not accept. He may devoutly wish to reduce farm subsidies or eliminate Legal Services, but he also knows Congress has turned him down, year after year.</p>
        <p>The detail of Mr. Reagan's plan is limited. The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law sets a Jan. 5 deadline and he has complied only technically by submitting a summary. Particulars are to follow in three weeks but there are some positive elements in what is known now. He does not propose increasing defense as much as in the past. He grapples at last with the spiraling costs of some major entitlement programs - farm subsidies, Medicare and Civil Service pensions. While he continues to insist, wrongly, that any ''tax increase'' is out of the question, he proposes to raise revenues by $23 billion.</p>
        <p>There are also some small signs of social concern: limited funding for the homeless . . . more money to retrain displaced workers . . . increases for AIDS research and reducing infant mortality among the poor . . . hesitant steps against acid rain. But in many more ways, this budget would chip away at programs that help the disadvantaged, directly and through strapped municipalities. He blames the deficit for such stringency and brags of at last making headway to get the deficit down -without mentioning whose Administration got it up.</p>
        <p>This budget is President Reagan's first communication with the new Congress. The language is carefully tempered; he seeks no confrontation, his spokesmen insist. But neither does he offer a plausible program. The budget is the President's time to lead, to take responsibility, to bet his poker hand. With this budget President Reagan says, I pass.</p>
