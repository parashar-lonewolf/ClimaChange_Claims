        <p>THE GHOST WITH TREMBLING WINGS  Science, Wishful Thinking and the Search for Lost Species  By Scott Weidensaul  341 pages. North Point Press. $26.</p>
        <p>The numbers are staggering. ''By conservative reckoning,'' Scott Weidensaul writes in his compelling new book, ''the planet loses 3 or 4 species an hour, 80 or more a day, 30,000 a year -- the highest extinction rate in 65 million years.''</p>
        <p>Although these exact numbers are disputed, many biologists agree that the world is witnessing a major wave of extinctions caused by human beings: by changes wrought in the environment by the population explosion, by industrial and agricultural development and by climate change.</p>
        <p>In ''The Ghost with Trembling Wings,'' Mr. Weidensaul focuses less on doomed creatures like the dodo and the passenger pigeon, which are lost and gone forever, than on the handful of organisms, once thought extinct, that have been rediscovered, lurking in isolated habitats or hiding from the human eye, sometimes hanging on by the thinnest of threads.</p>
        <p>The resulting book is part natural history, part adventure story (starring Mr. Weidensaul as a kind of ecological-minded Indiana Jones, roaming the world in search of missing species), part essay on the human ''need to believe the world is more complete than the catalog of vanishing ecosystems would indicate.'' The author meditates on the wishful thinking that leads people to look for monsters in Loch Ness and black panthers in the bucolic wilds of England -- ''we want the world to be more mysterious than it looks in the plain light of day,'' he writes -- but he also provides a thoughtful examination of the machinery of extinction, by which species become isolated, overspecialized or prey to new predators and diseases.</p>
        <p>By turns harrowing and elegiac, thrilling and informative, ''The Ghost With Trembling Wings'' takes the reader to exotic places like the hinterlands of Mato Grosso in western Brazil, where swarms of sweat bees plague those in search of the elusive cone-billed tanager (last seen some seven decades ago), and the woodlands of northeastern Tasmania, where, some believe, thylacines -- striped, wolflike marsupials -- continue to eke out an existence, despite being declared extinct in 1936.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weidensaul, author of a critically acclaimed study of migratory birds (''Living on the Wind,'' 1999), demonstrates his ability both to communicate the startling marvels of nature he has observed firsthand and to regale us with tales of scientific derring-do, plucked from the annals of natural history.</p>
        <p>His account of the rediscovery of the Indian forest owlet (presumed dead for almost a century) reads like a gripping detective story. It begins with the efforts of a former Smithsonian ornithologist, Pamela Rasmussen, to compile a new field guide to the birds of India, and her efforts to re-evaluate a collection -- compiled by Richard Meinertzhagen, a colorful big game hunter and British military man -- that had long been regarded as an important source of information on the avifauna of India. It was discovered that Meinertzhagen had stolen and relabeled many of the specimens, including that of the owlet, which researchers had consequently been looking for in all the wrong places. In November 1997 Ms. Rasmussen and three colleagues set out on a 750-mile trek across central India to look for the owlet, which they found near the end of their journey, not where Meinertzhagen's data suggested it might live but in a place with lower elevation.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Weidensaul's account of the search for the elusive ivory-billed woodpecker is somewhat familiar -- a more leisurely study of this iconic creature can be found in Christopher Cokinos's book ''Hope Is the Thing With Feathers'' -- his discussion of the plight of the black-footed ferret proves fascinating. The ferrets appeared to be on the verge of extinction as prairie dog towns (on which they depend for food and shelter) were eliminated from 98 percent of their original range in the United States. And yet the little creatures staged a comeback, as a captive breeding program, which had a paltry 18 animals on which to rebuild the species, began to have success in the late 1980's. By the spring of 2000, Mr. Weidensaul reports, there were more than 500 black-footed ferrets, with some 220 back in the wild.</p>
        <p>The problem is not only expense -- each captive-bred ferret costs in the neighborhood of $10,000 to produce -- but viability of life in the wild as well. Captive-bred animals must be trained to readapt to the real world, and as Mr. Weidensaul observes, ''unless there is a sea change in attitudes on the ranches of the West toward prairie dogs,'' the range of the black-footed ferret ''will remain dangerously fragmented, subject to local extinctions from disease and chance.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the rediscovery of certain lost species -- not to mention talk about the theoretical possibility of cloning extinct animals, à la ''Jurassic Park'' -- may give people false hope that extinction can easily be reversed. ''How joyful, really, is the resurrection of a species, if the modern world cannot find a single safe haven for it,'' Mr. Weidensaul writes, ''and if it seems doomed to slip into limbo once more anyway? It's an issue conservationists have had to struggle with repeatedly over the years with lost species, which sometimes reappear, blinking like Rip Van Winkle, in a landscape no longer able to support them, or incapable of recapturing the skills needed to live in the wild.''</p>
