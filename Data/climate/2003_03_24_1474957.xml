        <p>Potential terrorism is focus of several new patents, including one for system to incapacitate airplane hijackers or terrorists by flooding aircraft cabin with an anesthetic or nausea-inducing aerosol, another for system of detecting anthrax in mail without opening or otherwise handling envelopes or packages, and yet another for kit that can shield from biological or chemical attack designated areas of public buildings that have large open spaces connected by central heating and air-conditioning systems (M)</p>

        <p>WITH the nation on a heightened state of alert, inventors are working on security devices that might have been considered extreme just a few years ago.</p>
        <p>For example, Ariel S. Rogson of Portland, Ore., has won a patent for a system to incapacitate airplane hijackers or terrorists by flooding an aircraft cabin with an anesthetic. The switch for the aerosol would be controlled by the pilot, in a cockpit hermetically sealed off from the passenger cabins and galleys.</p>
        <p>''The cockpit of the aircraft is isolated from the cabin, preventing the mingling of air,'' Mr. Rogson stated in his patent. ''Instead, the cockpit has its own ventilation system, including blower and vents.''</p>
        <p>In the event of a hijacking, the pilot can flip a switch to open an aerosol canister that sends the gas into the passenger cabin.</p>
        <p>''Preferably, the incapacitating aerosol is a colorless, odorless, fast-acting gas that will disable all persons in the cabin of the aircraft, and will incapacitate an individual even if they are using some article of clothing to filter the air they breathe,'' Mr. Rogson stated.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rogson said the gas could also be ''a nausea-inducing agent that can incapacitate without anesthetizing people.''</p>
        <p>Whatever the gas, he acknowledges that all passengers might be sickened by it.</p>
        <p>''But the likelihood of such an effect is marginal,'' he concludes, ''especially relative to the risk associated with a hijacking or terrorist incident.''</p>
        <p>Security screeners at airports would have to add gas masks and other respirators to the list of items that people are prohibited from carrying onto airplanes. Mr. Rogson anticipates that would be a problem only for scuba divers and a few others.</p>
        <p>He won patent 6,499,693.</p>
        <p>Hoping to prevent episodes like the anthrax contaminations in the autumn of 2001, William L. Robinson Jr. has won a patent for a system of detecting biological toxins in mail.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson of Baltimore, Md., says his system can detect anthrax bacteria in mail without anyone's needing to open or otherwise handle envelopes or packages, and it would allow any contaminated mail to be quarantined.</p>
        <p>The crucial element is a detection strip coated with an acid-based liquid solution. The strip can be ''paper, cotton, string or any moderately porous material,'' Mr. Robinson wrote in his patent.</p>
        <p>The strip would be placed in the envelope, opposite a transparent panel like those found in conventional, business or ''window'' envelopes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson does not explain why a terrorist would use one of his envelopes if the intention is to mail anthrax bacteria. And if Mr. Robinson hopes his envelopes would become mandatory for use in the United States mail and with package delivery services, his patent does not include that plan.</p>
        <p>The strip must be placed to ''be read from the outside without opening the package or container,'' he adds. The envelope or packaging should also be sealed against leakage.</p>
        <p>If the envelope contains anthrax, the toxins produced by the live bacteria would interact with the acids on the detector strip and cause it to change color. Anyone inspecting the piece of mail would be able to see the color change through the transparent window.</p>
        <p>''The change in color is substantially irreversible,'' Mr. Robinson says in the patent, ''and will occur in moderate ambient temperatures down to below freezing if an appropriate indicating solution is utilized.''</p>
        <p>Each envelope should also bear an invisible magnetic strip or watermark that a machine can read to ensure that it is not a ''fraudulent imitation of the envelope or package.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson says his detector strip can also be placed on gloves worn by postal employees who handle mail. He says mail bins and other storage containers could be equipped with his ''biological agent indicator,'' so that ''the mail therein is effectively held in quarantine.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson received patent 6,524,846.</p>
        <p>It is common advice these days: Buy plastic sheeting and stock up on bottled water to create a safe room against chemical or biological attack. But public buildings, with large open spaces connected by central heating and air-conditioning systems, present a different challenge.</p>
        <p>Ruth D. Kreichauf has won a patent for Honeywell International in Morristown, N.J., for a kit that can turn designated spaces in public buildings into safe rooms.</p>
        <p>''The rooms can be specially built, retrofitted, or rapidly adapted to serve as a safe haven,'' the patent states.</p>
        <p>''The room can include an oxygen source such as an oxygen generator,'' she adds. ''The invention also includes a carbon dioxide scrubber to remove gaseous carbon dioxide from the room atmosphere.'' In some cases, she says, the invention could include ''a chemical air revitalizer capable of both absorbing carbon dioxide and generating oxygen.''</p>
        <p>But a first step in the event of attack or emergency would be to seal the room from outside air. ''In specially built and retrofitted rooms, this is possible using mechanical closable and sealable ducts and vents,'' like air valves and dampers.</p>
        <p>But in rooms that must be instantly turned into safe quarters, ''the sealing can be accomplished using a kit'' featuring devices to block any air flow into the room.</p>
        <p>''Room vents can be removed and foam and/or inflatable bladders inserted into ducts entering the room,'' Ms. Kreichauf wrote. ''A canister of rapidly curing polymeric foam can be activated and inserted into a duct.''</p>
        <p>She says that ''sealing tape, such as duct tape, can be used either alone or in combination with other devices to seal vent openings into rooms.''</p>
        <p>As for additional oxygen, it can come from a tank of compressed oxygen, or from a chemical source ''using a reaction similar to that used to supply oxygen to airplane passenger face masks.''</p>
        <p>Another item in the emergency safe room kit might be ''an oxygen-generating candle which produces oxygen'' when burned, she adds.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kreichauf received patent 6,428,680.</p>
