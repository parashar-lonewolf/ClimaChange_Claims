        <p>THE material world can be fragile and fleeting, and few people appreciate this as profoundly as a New York man named George Beylerian. Last week, in his airy offices on West 25th Street, Mr. Beylerian faced a fresh reminder of this transient state of affairs.</p>
        <p>Formica, he said, had just filed for bankruptcy protection.</p>
        <p>It was a sunny morning, and Mr. Beylerian, 66, wore a gray knit shirt and sweater, a striped tie and oval glasses that gave him the air of a hipster on holiday. The Formica news hung like a cloud of rue.</p>
        <p>Some people collect baseball cards or gossip about royal families. Mr. Beylerian collects and obsesses over materials.</p>
        <p>In the sprawling world of new design materials, Mr. Beylerian is a fixer, a raconteur, a flatterer, a believer. As he spoke, he looked out on neatly arranged samples of 3,000 substances, each with its own stories.</p>
        <p>He rubbed his smallish, soft hands across the smooth walls of his office. These surfaces, too, bore a story of material affection and regret. The paneling was a new composite made from the waste fibers of sugar cane stalks. It was cheap, handsome and easy on the environment -- a product with a future. ''Then the man went out of business,'' Mr. Beylerian said. He shook his head as if at a catch that got away. ''If I knew,'' he said, ''I could have brokered an adoption.''</p>
        <p>By his own job description, Mr. Beylerian is a ''gadfly,'' a ''knowledge broker,'' a ''dirty old merchant'' and ''a materials freak purely as a dilettante.'' Really he is a matchmaker.</p>
        <p>In 1997, after a career in retail and design, he started what he calls his ''petting zoo for new materials'' as a resource for architects and designers. For a price, they could run their fingers through the latest slimes, gels, resins, foams, holographic films and laminates that only an obsessive like him would collect. He called it Material ConneXion, almost like a dating service.</p>
        <p>As his library of odd materials grew, he hoped the interaction of technology, art and commerce would spark new design ideas. He also hoped it would yield a business model.</p>
        <p>Mr. Beylerian said: ''The real question is, is it a business? Is it a nonprofit? Is it a foundation?  The answer is, it could be all of the above. I didn't scheme this in any way except for the passion.''</p>
        <p>Laura Bohn, a designer who has tapped Mr. Beylerian's expertise for more than a decade, put the case for Material ConneXion differently. Before him, she said, designers had to sort through bins of industrial samples on Canal Street.</p>
        <p>Mr. Beylerian has built a roster of about 700 members, who pay from $500 to more than $10,000 a year to use the library and consult with the staff of 19. The company does not test the materials or take a commission on successful matches. Each month, an outside jury of 8 to 12 architects and designers evaluates about 40 materials for inclusion in the collection. The latest approvals include a plastic sheeting made with recycled coffee grounds. ''You can imagine how much coffee waste there is in America,'' said Andrew Dent, the director of the library. The showroom runs on equal parts technology and schmooze, a reflection of Mr. Beylerian's deep-rooted passions.</p>
        <p>He was born in Alexandria, Egypt, the son of a merchant family, and moved to New York in 1957, after the Egyptian government nationalized businesses. In the 1970's and 80's, working for the Italian firm Kartell and for his own Beylerian boutique, he became a crusader for high-quality plastic furnishings in the United States.</p>
        <p>While working as creative director for a division of the furniture maker Steelcase, he helped organize a 1990 exhibition at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum called ''Mondo Materialis,'' a coming-out party for such materials as neoprene sheeting and electrochromatic glass that could change color throughout the day.</p>
        <p>''It was a moral mission,'' said Ben Lloyd, a designer and former editor of Metropolitan Home magazine. ''George believed he was doing something better for society, making things with new materials in a timely shape.''</p>
        <p>On this day, Mr. Beylerian and members of his staff were recovering from two-day visits from Nike and BMW, both interested in materials developed for uses other than in sneakers or cars. Also, some visiting students had peeled the red gel blobs from a bench in his hallway, using them to add voluptuous, if mock-slutty, effect to their silhouettes.</p>
        <p>Such mischief, whether corporate or collegiate, is how many new materials reach the home, said Toshiko Mori, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. ''There's a lot of technology transfer,'' she said, citing materials developed for use in weapons, boats and space exploration that found their ultimate use, their ''killer app,'' in housewares or toys. Today's warhead is tomorrow's blobby coffee table.</p>
        <p>Such technologies, Ms. Mori said, might not make it to domestic use, or profitability, without the worldly nudge of Mr. Beylerian. ''He's really promoting misuse of materials,'' she said. ''And he's such a visual person, everything goes through his severe editing process. He gives us a palette to work with.''</p>
        <p>For much of the last decade, experiments with new materials often reflected the puckish playhouse ethos of the dot-com boom. Mr. Dent expects the next generation to offer messages of safety and security. The war on terrorism, he said, will produce a broad and unpredictable wave of new materials. If there is a thermobaric toaster in your future, chances are that its path will wend through West 25th Street.</p>
        <p>Mr. Beylerian plans to take the security theme to the International Milan Furniture Fair next month. He asked designers to name five products they associated with safety. He is still tallying responses. One suggested cages for some Washington politicians, with breathing tubes in case global warming raises sea level over their heads. It was the sort of prankish misuse Mr. Beylerian appreciates.</p>
        <p>Like many obsessives, Mr. Beylerian spends a good part of his time in genial grumble about his obsession. ''I'm burnt out every day,'' he said. ''The next time I create something, I don't have to run it. But with this, do you think some fancy rich investor would ever run it? It's too much energy.'' Between complaints, he talked excitedly about plans to expand to Europe, Detroit and beyond.</p>
        <p>Elliott Kaufman, a photographer and longtime friend of Mr. Beylerian, dismissed the grousing. ''I don't think you'll ever retire, George,'' he said. ''It's your life, it's who you are.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Beylerian did not argue. He had connections to make, clients to schmooze.</p>
