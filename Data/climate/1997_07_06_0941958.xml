        <p>WHAT could be more thrilling than watching grass grow? Not much, if you're the primary director of Rutgers University's world-renowned Turfgrass Breeding Program.</p>
        <p>''Let me show you my best bentgrasses,'' said Dr. Bill Meyer, guiding his sport utility vehicle to an array of pots, each one overflowing with a lush, fine-bladed, deep-green plant that would spruce up any windowsill.</p>
        <p>''I spent three weeks last summer going to golf courses maybe 100 years old all over New Jersey and Long Island'' -- Baltusrol in Springfield, Canoe Brook in Summit, Suburban in Union, and Shinnecock on Long Island among them -- ''and each one of these came from a little sliver I dug up on one of those courses.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Meyer lifted a sprig to show the vitality of the stolons, the runners that will allow the grass to spread quickly across tomorrow's putting greens.</p>
        <p>''For me,'' he said, ''this is really exciting.''</p>
        <p>Breeding a denser, more disease-resistant putting-green carpet may seem like an arcane pursuit to the lawn owner with a half-acre lot who's just looking for a cure for crab grass. But Dr. Meyer's fledgling bentgrass project is only a tiny part of the work of Rutgers's Center for Interdisciplinary Studies in Turfgrass Science, the products of whose research are visible (and mowable) in backyards and ball fields across the state and around the world.</p>
        <p>Over the past 35 years, Rutgers scientists have developed landmark varieties of bluegrass (midnight) and rye grass (Manhattan), helped turned fescue, a broader-leafed grass than blue or rye, into a household name. A Rutgers agronomist, C. Reed Funk,  made the revolutionary discovery that fungi called endophytes that live in grasses can repel all manner of pests.</p>
        <p>''Rutgers is right up there in the world of turfgrass,'' said W. Lee Berndt, a turf consultant in Jupiter, Fla., who publishes an industry newsletter called The Turf Letter. ''It's certainly one of the top-caliber schools in the world for what it does.''</p>
        <p>And as public pressure builds for homeowners and golf course operators alike to wean their grass off toxic chemicals, the turfgrass center, founded in 1991, is shaping the lawn of tomorrow. Its genetic engineers are bombarding grass seed with disease-resistant DNA from tobacco plants. Its entomologists are breeding voracious hybrids of the microscopic worms known as nematodes that eat lawn-destroying grubs. And Dr. Meyer and his cohorts are traveling from Bergen County to Bolivia in search of better, stronger grasses.</p>
        <p>''A lot of the advances that have been made over the past 30 years -- in color of grass, low-growing heights, stress tolerance -- have sort of leveled off,'' said Dr. Bruce Clarke, the center's Director. That requires us to go to the next level, which often means going to other parts of the world where grass grows naturally and looking for beneficial endophytes or grasses that have natural resistance to disease and insects.''</p>
        <p>Color, Density, Growth The Old-Fashioned Way</p>
        <p>Breeding grass the old-fashioned way, as Dr. Meyer does at the 200-acre research farm, a vast checkerboard of turf squares set among the neat-lawned subdivisions and sprawling horse farms of Monmouth County, takes years.</p>
        <p>Whatever the species, with each year's generation the breeders try to get closer to a Platonic grass that combines deep color, high density, slow growth, heat and pest resistance, high seed yield and ability to flourish with a minimum of water and fertilizer.</p>
        <p>''We go through thousands and thousands of hybrids,'' Dr. Meyer said. ''It's like the lottery; you keep combining different numbers until you get what you want.''</p>
        <p>Everywhere along the way, there are trade-offs. Disease spreads more easily and quickly in grass that grows in appealing-looking dense thatches. Grasses that seed early, which are cheaper for Western farmers to grow because they avoid having to irrigate their fields at the height of summer, tend to produce stemmy, thin lawns.</p>
        <p>To breed toughness into the turf, the researchers expose it to the worst conditions imaginable.</p>
        <p>''Look at this,'' Dr. Meyer said, getting down on his hands and knees and running his hand across a sad patch of bluegrass whose blades were tan and shredded. He lifted his palm to show a set of powdery black stripes. ''That's striped smut. We're spreading this all over the farm because if our new bluegrasses aren't resistant to striped smut, we want to find out in a hurry.''</p>
        <p>Fortunately for science, central New Jersey does not lack for smut, nor for leaf spot, summer patch, stem rust, pythium fungus or powdery mildew. Insect pests -- white grubs, billbugs, chinch bugs and sod webworms -- are plentiful, too.</p>
        <p>''New Jersey is an excellent place to run a breeding program,'' said Dr. Funk, Rutgers's living lawn legend and the director of the breeding program from 1962 until last year. ''It's warm and humid, but it has fairly cold winters. You want to subject grasses to the stresses they'll find in nature: heat, drought, cold, ice sheets, diseases, insects and so forth.''</p>
        <p>Where stresses don't naturally exist, the researchers cause them. ''We have a machine we've developed to actually abuse the grass,'' Dr. Meyer said, referring to a contraption with rotating rubber paddles that simulates the wear and tear of thousands of pedestrians. New Jersey is also an ideal proving ground for turf simply by virtue of being at the center of the East Coast's suburban sprawl.</p>
        <p>''We probably have more lawn-type turf, whether it's on a golf course, a school playground, a home lawn or sports field, within a 200-mile radius of Rutgers than anywhere else in the world,'' Dr. Funk said. ''So it's a tremendous market, and seed industries that are looking to develop new varieties are very interested in how they do in New Jersey, because that reflects how they'll do in Westchester and Long Island and Connecticut and everywhere else around here.''</p>
        <p>New Jersey, being one of the longest-settled parts of the country, is also rich in turf history and a good place to find older grasses that have passed the test of time and might make good breeding stock.</p>
        <p>''You go to an old German-Jewish cemetery, you find the old blue fescues that were collected in Germany,'' Dr. Funk said. ''If I go to a golf course that was planted prior to the Second World War, a lot of their deep roughs are the original grass and I'll find velvet bent that was a component of the Old South German mixed bent. If you go down to the old estates in places like Lakewood, if they haven't renovated the turf areas you see these same grasses, the blue fescues and mixed bents.'' As far as grasses have come over the years -- and Dr. Meyer said that today's lawn, in addition to being far healthier, produces about twice as much seed and needs mowing half as often as the lawns of our parents -- there is still plenty of room for improvement.</p>
        <p>Fighting Grubs With Nematodes</p>
        <p>''Grubs and pythium'' -- a fungus that can spread like wildfire across a lawn that sits underwater for any length of time -- ''are two problems we haven't solved yet,'' Dr. Meyer said. ''The only thing we have is some grasses that have heat tolerance in their root system, which allows them to re-root after grubs chew their roots off in August.''</p>
        <p>The problem of grubs, fat white larvae, usually of Japanese beetles, that are now attacked mostly with pesticides, is being addressed at Rutgers's Cook College in New Brunswick in what Prof. Randy Gaugler boasts is the world's biggest nematode laboratory. A nematode is a microscopic, faceless worm that bores a hole into an insect larva and defecates a bacterium into its innards, causing a disease that quickly kills it. Professor Gaugler is working to design a deadlier one.</p>
        <p>Last year, he licensed the rights to a vicious hybrid nematode bred from specimens he collected at 10 different sites in New Jersey to an Italian company that plans to market it worldwide. He has also created the world's first genetically engineered nematode, endowing it with the longer shelf life it will need if it is to compete in stores against stable chemicals.</p>
        <p>Not all the solutions to the world's turf problems are quite so high-tech. Since stepping aside as director of the turfgrass program, Dr. Funk has launched a new project: breeding more-productive, disease-resistant nut trees to meet humanity's growing demand for cheap protein. His pecan and hickory groves at the edge of the turf farm are allowing Dr. Meyer to begin a project he has planned for years.</p>
        <p>''Twenty-five percent of the all the turf in the world grows in the shade,'' Dr. Meyer said. ''but no one in the world is doing breeding under shade at a university level. It's a real hassle to keep the conditions uniform, and it's expensive.</p>
        <p>''Now I'll use his trees to develop my research area. He'll be breeding pecans. I'll be doing shade research.''</p>
