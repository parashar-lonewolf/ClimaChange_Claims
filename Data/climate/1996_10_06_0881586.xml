        <p>NEW JERSEY'S newest elementary school crouches among the fields here, barely visible from the road. It is long and low, with wide hallways and classrooms around a grassy courtyard. But the things that set the Copper Hill School apart from older schools -- a geothermal heating system, for example, and 40 miles of wiring to support a sophisticated computer network -- are invisible to residents of this town, who are footing the $14 million bill.</p>
        <p>The design of Copper Hill contrasts sharply with those of schools built in the past, when educators, architects and New Jersey taxpayers -- who have the power to defeat school construction plans in bond referendums -- had different priorities. It is subtle and practical, from the earth-colored concrete facade to the heating system that does not use fossil fuels to the extra rooms for adult education and day care. The fanciest feature is the computer network, which will connect every room to the Internet and allow students to communicate with others around the state and the world.</p>
        <p>In comparison, schools built in the first half of the century were more interesting to look at, with pillars, gabled roofs and stone carvings that created an aura of grandeur. In the 1950's the postwar baby boom caused an explosion in school construction, with little thought given to design or curriculum needs. In the 1970's the oil crisis made efficient heating a priority, and many schools were built with no windows.</p>
        <p>These days, everyone involved in school design agrees that programming needs, not just for students but for the community as a whole, should be the top priority. But since school budgets in New Jersey are always tight, tough choices must be made. Through numerous public meetings, school officials eliminate possibilities that might be seen as excessive. Stages are often vetoed, for example, as are swimming pools and most kinds of ornamentation.</p>
        <p>''You have to stay on a flexible, functional design, or it's probably not going to be accepted,'' said Scott R. Spiezle, whose Trenton architectural firm designed Copper Hill. ''In other states, I have seen schools with waterfalls, huge aquariums, gorgeous design elements. But I don't believe the public in New Jersey is willing to pay for these things.''</p>
        <p>What the public is willing to pay for these days, architects and school officials say, are spaces that will accommodate residents of all ages, at all hours of the day. In cities and suburbs, school buildings are becoming community hubs where the elderly can use the library, middle-aged adults can take evening classes and children of working parents can stay for after-school programs. If a new school offers perks for the whole community, they say, it might appeal to childless residents who would otherwise fight it.</p>
        <p>''We are undergoing tremendous changes in the nature of family and community life,'' said Roy Strickland, director of the New American School Design Project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''Schools should be thinking about providing services for everyone from very young children to older adults, from early morning into evening.''</p>
        <p>With enrollments climbing fast in much of the state -- Flemington and the rest of Hunterdon County, in particular, are experiencing a population boom -- school designers are making buildings flexible enough to accommodate growing class sizes and untraditional schedules. For the many school districts that are considering year-round classes, air-conditioning is no longer optional. Some new schools have folding walls between classrooms, and others have separate cafeterias and gymnasiums, to accommodate lunch periods that start as early as 9:45 A.M.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, technology is changing the most basic elements of school design. Fluorescent lights, which cause glare on computer screens, are being replaced with softer, indirect lighting. Libraries are becoming ''media centers,'' with less space allotted for shelves and more for computers, which can store every reference book and periodical on CD-ROM. Teacher lounges are now known as ''work spaces,'' and along with sagging couches, they have computers, conference tables and phones with voice mail.</p>
        <p>To complicate the planning process, new schools must comply with dozens of state and Federal mandates, a fire code and energy-efficiency ratios. Ceiling height, space between desks and wall thickness are strictly regulated, and plans must go through several stages of approval. All of these requirements, along with the directive to spend frugally, make it easy to overlook what is perhaps the most important question of all: What kind of impression will a new school make on the people who will spend their formative years there?</p>
        <p>Certain details will linger in their minds long after they move on: the feel of the brick facade when they lean against it; the color of the classroom walls; the way sunlight filters through the windows and sounds echo through the halls. Mr. Strickland of M.I.T. says architects need to make schools more comfortable for the children who spend long hours there.</p>
        <p>''If you look at the plan of a nicely designed house, there are large spaces for shared activities, as well as more private alcoves for people to be alone,'' he said. ''Schools need to become more homelike.''</p>
        <p>ORIGINS  Wood and Spitoons</p>
        <p>Historians say the first school in New Jersey was built in 1662, in a Dutch settlement that is now part of Jersey City. By the early 1800's, dozens of one-room schoolhouses were scattered around the state.</p>
        <p>But towns did not start using tax dollars to build free public schools until the 1840's, when special acts of the State Legislature allowed some localities to raise money for school construction. Newark, Camden, Jersey City and Bridgeton were among the first to have graded public schools, which were typically made of brick and shaped like boxes.</p>
        <p>The first public high school opened in Newark in 1855, and others followed in Paterson, Plainfield, Orange and New Brunswick. In 1876, the State Constitution guaranteed a free public education for every child, with a State School Fund to help with the cost. But until the turn of the century, tiny schoolhouses were the norm, and many were in poor condition.</p>
        <p>''The floors are broken through, and the children cluster in the corner during rain storms, and shiver as wintry blasts whistle through,'' wrote Charles Morrow, the schools superintendent in Wantage, Sussex County, in 1864. ''Floors answer for spitoons and they are well used by teachers and pupils; furniture rude and sadly cut up.''</p>
        <p>Such problems were so widespread that in 1865, the State Superintendent of Schools circulated designs to help towns build more durable schools. By 1874, the Superintendent's annual report included suggestions for 23 types of school buildings, with simple square classrooms, desks bolted to floors,  and bell towers that held ventilation shafts.</p>
        <p>By the turn of the century, schools were being modeled after other public buildings, like city halls and post offices, with facades in Greek Revival, Queen Anne and other traditional styles. The top floor was usually an assembly hall, and the others held only classrooms. Gymnasiums did not become common until the 1920's, and libraries and cafeterias came even later.</p>
        <p>In 1996, 64 of New Jersey's 2,300 school buildings are more than a century old, which means that thousands of children are making do with archaic floor plans, outdoor gym classes and lunch hours held in basements or wherever they will fit. But it also means, school officials say, that the older buildings are much more durable than their midcentury counterparts.</p>
        <p>In Fairview, Bergen County, 250 elementary school students still attend Public School No. 3, built in 1908. The district recently spent $1 million to replace the windows, heating system and lighting, and the third-floor assembly hall has been converted to classrooms. The basement serves as a cafeteria and rainy-day gym, but the rest of the school remains untouched.</p>
        <p>''That place is built like a fort,'' said Patrick Caufield, the business administrator, adding that the inside walls are two feet thick and the brick facade has never needed a facelift. ''It's not going anywhere.''</p>
        <p>BABY BOOM  Sprawling Conformity</p>
        <p>By the 1950's, suburban school districts were in dire need of extra space, and they were building dozens of new schools every year. These Baby Boom schools were built quickly and inexpensively to accommodate new neighborhoods in counties like Middlesex, Monmouth and Somerset. Unlike their predecessors, they were usually sprawling, one-story buildings, with flat roofs, painted cinder block walls, and wings that could fit dozens of classrooms.</p>
        <p>Fifty percent of the nation's public schools were built in the 1950's and 60's, including hundreds of New Jersey's suburban schools. More than 400 elementary schools were built in New Jersey from 1953 to 1962. Instead of brick, facades were often made of glass and metal panels, and windows were trimmed with flimsy aluminum. Roofs were flat, and layouts were often so confusing that it was (and still is) hard to find the main entrance.</p>
        <p>''The suburbs back then were homogeneous environments with homogeneous families,'' said Mr. Strickland, the M.I.T. professor. ''Boards of education were responding to that with homogeneous schools, plunked down smack in the middle of the community.''</p>
        <p>Inside the schools, though, some of the innovations of the 1950's and 60's were important. Desks were no longer fixed to the floors, and many elementary classrooms had library nooks and art corners. School libraries were more common, as were classrooms equipped for industrial arts and home economics.</p>
        <p>Many postwar schools had classrooms painted in colors that many students now consider mind-numbing; washed-out greens and yellows seem to have been especially popular. But at the time, they caused mild excitement. A 1958 article in a New Jersey newspaper praised the ''color engineers'' who designed Watchung Hills Regional and Millburn High Schools. In the former, one classroom had typewriters in ''sea-foam green,'' ''desert sand'' and ''sapphire gray.'' In the latter, even the administrative offices were painted in ever-so-subtle pastels.</p>
        <p>When the principal and his assistant inspected their new offices, the article said, ''they found the walls a dreamy blue, the sample swatches labeled 'Wedgwood.' ''</p>
        <p>Pablo L. Jordan, a Raritan architect who has designed schools for 30 years, said many schools built in the 1970's ''took color too far in the other direction,'' with walls painted orange and red. Now, he said, the trend is toward muted colors again, although sleepy yellows and greens remain unthinkable, Mr. Jordan said. Schools that have kept those colors have higher vandalism rates than those with taupes, beiges and grays, he said.</p>
        <p>Starting in the late 1960's, when forward-thinking educators were calling for open classrooms and team teaching, some school designs verged on wacky. Some New Jersey schools built in that period were circular, with wide-open spaces instead of separate classrooms. Architects say those schools are partitioning up their inside space now, but the oddly shaped classrooms that result can cause problems. Today's taxpayers do not suffer such eccentric designs gladly, and for good reason, Mr. Strickland said.</p>
        <p>''A lot of it,'' he said, ''comes down to common sense.''</p>
        <p>NEW AGE  Community Clubhouse</p>
        <p>James Gamble, the principal at the Copper Hill School, could not agree more. He offered suggestions for the building several years ago, with input from parents, teachers and other administrators. Technology was the top priority, he said, followed by rooms for community use.</p>
        <p>As for the building itself, the school district wanted what Mr. Spiezle, the architect, calls ''basic finishes'': concrete-block walls, drop ceilings and vinyl floor tiles. The building looks nice, Mr. Gamble said, but he was more eager to talk about the front hallway, which is wide enough to drive a school bus through.</p>
        <p>''We had a carnival in the hall a few weeks ago,'' he said. ''There were a few hundred people milling around. In the hallway!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pease, the Raritan architect, says wide halls provide an extra common space, which is crucial when enrollment is up and space is tight. It also makes a school more comfortable, he said, as do courtyards with benches, and alcoves where students can relax.</p>
        <p>''We're doing more areas for students to enjoy themselves,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Although many educators are calling for smaller, more intimate schools, the numerous New Jersey towns that face enrollment booms do not have that option. Copper Hill has room for 900 students, and it is already up to 650. In Warren County, the tiny town of Pohatcong is building an elementary school big enough for 1,000 students, because its population is expected to triple over the next decade.</p>
        <p>But large schools can be subdivided into smaller ''pods'' that feel more intimate, architects say. At Copper Hill, the kindergarten classrooms are isolated in an octagonal wing, with a separate playground and a common area in the middle. The gymnasium has a folding wall that can create smaller spaces, as do several classrooms.</p>
        <p>The school has some distinctive touches, but each serves its purpose. Skylights in the hallway allow natural light to filter in, and pillars out front support a pavilion that shields students from rain.</p>
        <p>But if school buildings are going to serve as second homes and community clubhouses, perhaps the most meaningful details will be contributed by the people who spend time there. At Copper Hill, some classrooms have soft throw rugs, rocking chairs and couches. Already, the concrete walls are replete with essays that reveal students' hopes, dreams and favorite foods.</p>
        <p>And the other day, when a noisy group of budding athletes did jumping jacks in that wide front hallway, the echo was just about right.</p>
