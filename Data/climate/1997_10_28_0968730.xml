        <p>If President Clinton is shocked that two-thirds of the energy used to produce electricity is ''squandered'' as waste heat (Week in Review, Oct. 26), he shouldn't be. And we can reduce that ''waste'' without repealing the laws of thermodynamics only by moving to generation methods that aren't based on heat, like solar photovoltaics and fuel cells.</p>
        <p>However, those who promote hydrogen use as alternative ''fuel'' for fuel cells are misguided. Since there are no hydrogen wells, it must be extracted from traditional fuels like natural gas, ethanol or petroleum.</p>
        <p>We must generate and use energy more efficiently and with fewer emissions, but our laws must comply with nature's, because it is immune to lobbying.</p>
