        <p>A BAND of American tree aficionados has fresh designs on Robin Hood's hideout in Sherwood Forest near Nottingham, England. If all goes as planned, one of them will scale a wizened white oak 11 feet in diameter -- reputed to be 1,000 years old and a Robin Hood meeting place -- and slice a tiny baby branch from its tip. The new growth, gingerly packed in dry ice, will then be rushed overnight to a cloning lab in the United States.</p>
        <p>''We're just waiting for final permission,'' said David Milarch, president of the Champion Tree Project, which is organizing the foraging operation.</p>
        <p>A seven-year-old nonprofit group that recently added the word International to its name, the Champion Tree Project is small but its ambitions are vast: to identify and clone the largest and most historic specimens of 870 species in the United States and many others overseas.</p>
        <p>With one eye on the calendar -- August is prime time for collecting tree tissue because that is when new growth starts hardening for the winter -- Mr. Milarch is a busy man right now. Next month, he and his son, Jared, hope to gather samples from tulip poplars at Monticello that were planted by Thomas Jefferson, part of a larger plan to assemble a Presidential Collection with specimens from trees once owned by Lincoln, Washington and Theodore Roosevelt.</p>
        <p>''We have 100 volunteers across the country,'' Mr. Milarch said, conjuring images of tree lovers pulling over whenever they pass a potential trophy along the highway.</p>
        <p>Armed with $300,000 in grants from the National Tree Trust, a group in Washington, Champion Tree Project International seeks two types of specimens: those whose extraordinary size and longevity seem to suggest an in-born resistance to disease, climate change and natural predators, and those whose age and provenance carry the appeal of any historic collectible.</p>
        <p>The group, working with private nurseries like Schichtel's Nursery Oregon, propagates tree ''tissues'' by taking single buds from a champion tree and grafting them to root stock from the same species. (''All the characteristics of the tree are in the bud,'' said George Schichtel, president of the nursery.) Or sometimes, Mr. Milarch said, cuttings are dipped in a growth hormone cocktail and potted in a temperature- and moisture-controlled fog chamber. Unlike seedlings, which are the product of two parent trees, clones derive 100 percent of their DNA from a single plant, he said.</p>
        <p>Botanists are not sure whether clones of champion trees do in fact offer champion genetics, and it may take decades before science has an answer. But the plans to copy the storied trees have captured international imagination.</p>
        <p>''I just got off the phone with the BBC,'' Mr. Milarch said on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Others find the cause compelling. ''Working on geriatric trees is a lot of fun,'' said Robert Bartlett, chairman of F. A. Bartlett Tree Expert Company, with headquarters in Stamford, Conn., and offices around the globe. It donated services and equipment when the Champion Tree Project planted a clone of one of Washington's white oaks at the Capitol on Arbor Day this spring, and it has offered to help out in Sherwood Forest as well.</p>
        <p>Believers also include members of the Ford family, who arranged to bring clones of Colonial-era trees at Mount Vernon to the grounds of the Edsel and Eleanor Ford House, now a museum and park in Grosse Pointe Shores, Mich.</p>
        <p>In the 1920's, the 87-acre grounds at the house were planted by the Danish landscape architect Jens Jensen, who wove together thousands of native elms, beeches, hawthornes, maples and oak trees in a naturalistic tableau. Since then, hundreds of the original trees have been toppled by ice and wind storms, lightning and Dutch elm disease.</p>
        <p>The Champion Tree Project took tissues from 13 trees that have been shading the bowling green at Mount Vernon since Washington planted them. They include white ash, tulip poplars, American hollies, a Canadian hemlock and a white mulberry.</p>
        <p>The Mount Vernon clones -- seven and eight feet tall -- were presented to Edsel Ford II and Mrs. William Clay Ford at a ceremony this spring. ''We're thrilled,'' Mrs. Ford said. ''We know they'll have a good home here.''</p>
        <p>Champion Tree Project (www.championtreeproject.org) maintains botanical archives with thousands of clones from 70 species of trees. Its History Botany collection includes clones of the nearly 5,000-year-old gnarly bristlecone pine called Methuselah, tracked down at a secret location in a California preserve with the help of the United States Forest Service. The Wye Oak, a white oak in rural Maryland, 400 years old and 32 feet around, was cloned before a storm knocked it over a year ago.</p>
        <p>The right to sell the offspring resides with the owner of the original tree (in Robin Hood's case, the town of Nottingham). Clones created from historic trees like those at Mount Vernon are not for sale and there are no immediate plans to commercialize them. The situation is a little different for clones of champion trees, including specimens of red ash, green ash and Norway maple that are being propagated by Schichtel's, a wholesale nursery in Milton-Freewater, Ore. The Champion Tree Project plans to start selling them at retail garden centers next April under the ChampTree brand name, priced from about $150.</p>
        <p>Tree cloning is getting a lift not only from historically minded collectors but also from green-city advocates, who fear that many of the handsome trees shading boulevards and city parks will slowly disappear because of air pollution, disease, soil compaction and old age.</p>
        <p>The emotional appeal of old trees could prove helpful in efforts to save urban forests -- the kind that cool off parks, sidewalks and asphalt. The project has identified a trove of champions along public thoroughfares, including a 90-foot white ash in downtown Palisades, N.Y. Clones of these tough survivors could be used to replant streets whose elms and other shade trees have begun to disappear.</p>
        <p>Many of the trees in the Grosse Pointes area of Michigan were already giants when the auto barons built their mansions there. And that has given Mr. Milarch an idea for another line of trees with a catchy name.</p>
        <p>''We hope a Ford Collection can be used to gain attention for the urban forest,'' Mr. Milarch said. ''Trees are in crisis but it's a quiet crisis. People need to be made aware.''</p>
