        <p>HEDGE FUND RULES -- The Bush administration said that there was no need for greater government oversight of the rapidly growing hedge fund industry and other private investment groups. It announced instead an agreement on a set of nonbinding principles. [Page A1.]</p>
        <p>EXECUTIVES LEAVE BANK -- The deterioration in the United States mortgage market has forced the departures of two top executives at HSBC Holdings. The departures come after HSBC surprised investors by announcing that it needed to increase its reserves for bad loans. [C1.]</p>
        <p>MICROSOFT LOSES PATENT CASE -- A federal jury ordered Microsoft to pay $1.52 billion in a patent dispute over the MP3 format, which is at the heart of the digital music boom. If upheld, the patent judgment would be the largest on record. [C1.]</p>
        <p>LABOR BILL -- Organized labor is fighting for a pro-union bill as if its life depended on it. The bill would make it far easier for workers to join unions, through a process known as a card check or majority signup. [A18.]</p>
        <p>OIL-FOR-FOOD SENTENCE -- In federal court in Manhattan, Tongsun Park, a South Korean businessman convicted of illegally representing Saddam Hussein in the United Nations' oil-for-food program for Iraq, was sentenced to five years in prison. [A10.]</p>
        <p>THE AMERICAN WAY -- With recent changes, start-ups are no longer rare in France and elsewhere in Europe. And Europe's new entrepreneurs are turning west, to learn the start-up culture bred in Silicon Valley. [C1.]</p>
        <p>NEW COOL -- Until recently, it looked as if the depleted ozone layer protecting the earth from harmful solar rays was on its way to being healed. But thanks in part to an explosion of demand for air-conditioners in places like India and China, the ozone layer is proving very hard to repair. [C1.]</p>
        <p>OPTIONS BACKDATING -- Lawyers and executives have watched the case of Brocade Communications to see how government investigations into stock option backdating will play out. But Brocade's $7 million settlement has offered little guidance. [C2.]</p>
        <p>CBS CABLE DEAL -- CBS announced it had concluded a series of agreements in which cable systems will compensate the network for the right to carry its programming. [C3.]</p>
        <p>BUILDING ON MYSPACE -- Fox Interactive Media, the News Corporation unit that operates MySpace, said it had acquired the Strategic Data Corporation, an advertising technology company, to help increase revenue from the popular Web site. [C7.]</p>
        <p>IRAN RATTLES MARKET -- Wall Street turned in a mixed performance as Iran's refusal to suspend uranium enrichment rattled investors and tempered a tech rally. The Dow fell 52.39 points, to 12,686.02. [C9.]</p>
        <p>FORECAST HITS PENNEY SHARES -- J. C. Penney reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings, but its shares fell sharply after it forecast a first-quarter profit below Wall Street estimates. [C4.]</p>
        <p>THE WAIT AT CHRYSLER -- A week after DaimlerChrysler signaled its plans to put the Chrysler Group on the auction block, an e-mail message sent to employees by Chrysler's chief executive, Thomas W. LaSorda, above, indicated it might be weeks or months before the automaker's future can be determined. [C3.]</p>
        <p>CANCER DRUG TEST -- Genentech said a low dose of its cancer drug Avastin worked just as well as a high dose in a clinical trial. Its shares fell amid concern that it would receive less revenue from the drug. [C7.]</p>
        <p>EXECUTIVES INDICTED -- Three executives of a cleaning and maintenance company, Rosenbaum-Cunningham International, were indicted on charges of defrauding the federal government of taxes owed on behalf of illegal immigrant workers. [A18.]</p>
        <p>AIRLINES ADDRESS RUNWAY DELAYS -- Working to head off passenger-rights legislation, the Air Transport Association, a trade group for United States airlines, has suggested voluntary fixes for long runway delays. [C9.]</p>
        <p>AMONG GENTLEMEN -- To help commemorate its 50th anniversary, GQ magazine is starting a charitable project called the Gentlemen's Fund. Advertising: Stuart Elliott. [C4.]</p>
        <p>ONLINE</p>
        <p>LEFT HOLDING THE BAG -- When a fast-food chain runs into trouble, franchise owners often take the hardest hit. A special report on Small Business is at nytimes.com/business.</p>
        <p>YOUR TAXES -- Suggestions on surviving an audit, and tax tips on pleasing Uncle Sam. A special report is at nytimes.com/business.</p>
        <p>Business Briefing  Articles on these developments are at nytimes.com/business.</p>
        <p>Gamco Investors, the asset manager headed by Mario Gabelli, said on Thursday it offered to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into mutual fund share trading and, as a result, has increased its legal and regulatory reserves by $3 million. (REUTERS)</p>
        <p>Johnson &amp; Johnson's Centocor unit received a subpoena in connection with an investigation into pricing of its drug Remicade, a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases. (REUTERS)</p>
        <p>The tax preparer H&amp;R Block swung to a loss in the third quarter as losses in its troubled mortgage lending arm offset a strong beginning of the tax season. (AP)</p>
        <p>Getty Images, the provider of stock and editorial photographs, said it planned to buy the celebrity photo distributor WireImage for $200 million and was in talks to acquire another rival. (REUTERS)</p>
