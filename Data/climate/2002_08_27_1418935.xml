        <p>At one end of the St. Johns River Power Park generating station, operators in a control room watch the computerized dials and gauges of a $1.2 billion system that runs day and night, winter and summer. It grinds coal down to the consistency of talcum powder and blows it into twin furnaces that produce steam to power turbines that turn out 1,280 megawatts of electricity.</p>
        <p>At the other end of the plant is a second computerized control room, for antipollution equipment through which hot furnace gases pass on their way to a 670-foot smokestack. The equipment cost $400 million, uses 5 percent of the plant's electrical output, and raises operating and maintenance costs 10 to 15 percent, plant managers say.</p>
        <p>As exhaust gases pass through the smokestack, they mix with limestone, which absorbs sulfur, a cause of acid rain, and they run through an electrostatic precipitator that attracts soot. Some day, the managers say, they will also use ''selective catalytic reduction'' to reduce nitrogen oxides.</p>
        <p>The timing depends on a debate in Washington over Environmental Protection Agency regulations for power plants, President Bush's proposals for air quality and other policy disputes. The debate centers on what modifications by a utility set off rules that require it to meet emission standards for plants built new today. These ''New Source Review'' rules apply to natural gas plants; to coal-fired stations, which produce more than half of the nation's electric power; and to other industrial plants that do not produce electricity.</p>
        <p>Some power plant operators say they are discouraged from making incremental improvements, for fear they will cause the rules to go into effect and force a wholesale makeover. But some advocates of New Source Review say the plant operators have learned how to make changes step by step, in effect rebuilding their plants from the inside out, sidestepping the law's requirements.</p>
        <p>The debate over the rules will affect utilities around the nation.</p>
        <p>Florida Power and Light, an investor-owned utility, and JEA, a municipal power, water and sewer company, jointly own the Florida plants.</p>
        <p>The organizations describe themselves as good environmental stewards. Next to the Power Park, JEA is rebuilding an older plant that ran on oil or natural gas to be among the cleanest coal plants in the world.</p>
        <p>But the St. Johns River operators hope to avoid the selective catalytic reduction system, or S.C.R., as long as they can.</p>
        <p>In that, they are like a majority of coal plants.</p>
        <p>The history of coal-burning plants and their modifications over time illustrate the possibilities and limits for making coal cleaner.</p>
        <p>Coal plants are a little like personal computers. If you know the year they were built, you know a great deal about their performance characteristics.</p>
        <p>When it comes to pollution, the most important characteristics relate to emissions of three chemicals: sulfur dioxide, a major factor in acid rain; nitrogen oxides, components of smog; and particulates or soot particles. Engineers call the three SOx, NOx and rocks.</p>
        <p>A fourth, carbon dioxide, is also important. The Clean Air Act does not define it as pollutant, in that it does not make the air unhealthy to breathe. But it is a major component of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. For each unit of heat delivered, coal releases twice as much carbon dioxide as natural gas and about a third more than oil.</p>
        <p>Standards for SOx and NOx have changed over the years. But with one highly disputed exception, plants are largely free to continue releasing those pollutants at the rate that was allowed when they were built. The exception, in the 1977 version of the Clean Air Act, is that if the plants make certain renovations, they become subject to the same rules as newly built plants under a procedure called ''New Source Review.'' That provision was not much enforced until the Clinton administration. Now the Bush administration is drafting a replacement rule, although Joe Martyak, a spokesman for the E.P.A., said the agency was continuing to enforce the existing one.</p>
        <p>In 1996, in the Clinton administration, the E.P.A. said many coal plants had incurred capital expenses that suggested that they had made renovations that subjected them to new source review. That is, they had changed their equipment and operations enough to initiate requirements to reduce pollution, as well.</p>
        <p>By and large, the operators denied that. But a Florida utility, Tampa Electric, settled. Several utilities are still in court. The Tennessee Valley Authority was sued. In June, an appeals court ordered it and the E.P.A. to try to negotiate a settlement.</p>
        <p>Utilities say new source review has been counterproductive, making it impossible for them to install small changes to make their plants slightly cleaner and slightly more efficient, because to do so would set off a requirement for extensive cleanup.</p>
        <p>The American Gas Association has argued that stringent rules may block a factory from installing gas-fired generators, because making them clean enough for current standards is difficult. Even if the factory installed a relatively dirty gas system, the trade group says, it would be far cleaner than the coal-fired plant it displaced.</p>
        <p>Utilities complain that the environmental regulators have confused maintenance, which is necessary to maintain reliable operations, with upgrades.</p>
        <p>Advocates of clean air say they are horrified by the idea that old plants, which they once thought would be phased out by now, could be replaced piece by piece -- rebuilt from the inside out, so to speak -- so that they are nearly eternal, without ever involving the new source requirements.</p>
        <p>Frank O'Donnell, the executive director of the Clean Air Trust, an advocacy group, said the nation needed the wholesale pollution reductions envisioned by the review process, not marginal changes in pounds of pollutant per million British thermal units of fuel burned.</p>
        <p>''Pounds per million B.T.U. don't kill people,'' Mr. O'Donnell said. ''Pollution kills people.''</p>
        <p>Executives at JEA said no work had been carried out at St. Johns that would involve a new source review. But the plant received a letter from the environmental agency 14 months ago that asked for records on every change made since the original construction.</p>
        <p>Regardless of how the regulations are enforced or altered, utilities say they will use a wide array of control technologies to reduce emissions from coal-fired plants.</p>
        <p>''One way or another, we see tighter controls coming,'' said Robert L. Kappelmann, an environmental consultant and a former JEA lobbyist.</p>
        <p>The most pressing issue for St. Johns is nitrogen oxides, a concern since opening day. Nitrogen oxides, which include several combinations of oxygen and nitrogen, combine in the air with hydrocarbons, unburned fuel molecules, to produce ground-level ozone, or smog.</p>
        <p>The nitrogen and the oxygen come from air, meaning that their emission cannot be reduced simply by moving to cleaner fuel. Conditions in the combustion chamber must be changed.</p>
        <p>In 1994, engineers here began modifying the coal burners to lower the peak temperature in the firebox to 1,600 degrees to reduce NOx. Powdered coal is blown into the furnace in something that looks like a blowtorch, and extra air is added to assure combustion and squeeze as much heat as possible from each pound of fuel. After the combustion gases have heated water into steam, they are used to preheat the air that flows to the furnace and preheat the water that flows to the boilers.</p>
        <p>When it finally exits the stack, the exhaust gas, also cooled by pollution-control equipment, is at 135 to 160 degrees.</p>
        <p>The B.T.U. is the coin of the power plant realm. It is the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of a pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. Fuel is priced by the million thermal units, and pollution is measured by pounds per million B.T.U.</p>
        <p>St. Johns does well with a thermal unit. The plant turns out a kilowatt-hour with 9,500 British thermal units, or two-thirds of a pound of coal. When drawn from the wall socket by a consumer, a kilowatt-hour will deliver 3,500 B.T.U.'s of heat, light 10 100-watt bulbs for an hour or run a window air-conditioner for an hour on a hot day.</p>
        <p>Over the years, the plant has also slightly improved how well it does with pollution from a million thermal units. St. Johns set to work in 1994 on NOx, because it chose to ''opt in'' to a government program that let it reduce pollution in return for ''pollution credits'' it could sell on the open market. After four years of work, adjusting the burners lowered the NOx output to 0.45 to 0.5 pounds per million B.T.U., down from 0.6 pounds per million B.T.U. Older plants, built in the 70's, put out 1.5 pounds per million thermal units.</p>
        <p>If St. Johns is required to add selective catalytic reduction, NOx output will fall, to 0.15 pounds per million B.T.U., the standard for new plants. But that will cost $100 million.</p>
        <p>The Northside plant, the adjacent plant that JEA is rebuilding, will put out 0.09 pounds per million B.T.U.</p>
        <p>The scrubber, which reduced SOx, was built with the plant. Other plants have added scrubbers in response to the Clean Air Act, switched to lower-sulfur coal or mechanically washed the coal before burning. The scrubber takes limestone, which is calcium carbonate, and mixes it with the sulfur-rich flue gases, to produce gypsum and carbon dioxide, in a chemical reaction that has been well understood for decades. The gypsum is sold for wallboard or other products. The carbon dioxide is emitted into the atmosphere.</p>
