        <p>Eagles, Micro and Macro</p>
        <p>Haast's eagle, which once patrolled the skies over New Zealand, was a giant of a bird, an S.U.V. in a parking lot full of sedans. With a wingspan of up to 9 feet and a weight of 30 pounds or more, the bird, Harpagornis moorei, was the largest eagle that ever lived and approached the physical limit for powered flight.</p>
        <p>Until 700 years ago, it was also at the top of the New Zealand food chain, preying on other birds including the huge flightless moa, which it could fell with a single crunching blow to the head. But then humans arrived, and the bird's days were numbered. It is now extinct.</p>
        <p>Earlier studies of skeletal remains had linked the bird to an Australian eagle, about a third the size but still a large creature. Now, though, a genetic analysis shows that Haast's eagle is more closely related to one of the world's smallest living eagles, a bird about one-tenth its size.</p>
        <p>The study, by New Zealand scientists working at the University of Oxford in Britain, analyzed DNA from two Haast's eagle specimens and samples from 16 modern eagle species. The results, reported in the online journal Public Library of Science Biology, show that the extinct eagle belongs with a group of small eagles of a different genus, Hieraaetus. The closest relative is the little eagle, from Australia and New Guinea, which generally weighs about two pounds.</p>
        <p>The analysis also showed that the big and small eagles diverged from a common ancestor 700,000 to 1.8 million years ago. The researchers suggest that a small eagle species arrived in New Zealand around that time and grew rapidly, aided by the availability of plenty of food (a single moa, for instance, could weigh up to 400 pounds) and the lack of predators. H. moorei, they say, is an extreme example of how lack of competition in island ecosystems can produce rapid change in a species.</p>
        <p>Secondary Meteor Smoke</p>
        <p>Earth is constantly bombarded by small meteorites that ablate and burn in the upper atmosphere. When the space rocks heat up, metals in them vaporize and combine with other minerals to form tiny metal-rich particles called meteoritic smoke.</p>
        <p>This smoke contains a lot of platinum and iridium, and it eventually falls out of the atmosphere. If the fallout could be measured and analyzed, it could help scientists understand more about the meteorite bombardment that created it.</p>
        <p>The problem has been finding traces of the fallout. Now, members of a team of European scientists say they have found it in an ice core from Greenland.</p>
        <p>In a report in the journal Nature, the researchers show a remarkably constant flux of platinum and iridium in the core covering the Holocene, the 11,000 years of the earth's history since the last ice age. Before that (the core covers the last 128,000 years in all), the ice age atmosphere contained so much metal-laden dust of terrestrial origin that the effects of the meteorite bombardment were masked.</p>
        <p>The researchers say that the analysis of the cores from the Holocene implies an average global fallout of about 14,000 kilotons of meteoritic smoke each year. This is in line with other estimates of the amount of ablating meteorites.</p>
        <p>When Carbon Was Needed</p>
        <p>There may have been a lot of dust during the last ice age, but there was about half the present-day concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. And that lack of carbon dioxide, it turns out, probably had an effect on plant productivity, according to a study of ancient juniper trees preserved in the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>The tree specimens, up to 55,000 years old, were studied by Joy Ward of the University of Kansas and colleagues, who analyzed the concentrations of carbon isotopes. They found evidence that the trees were starved for carbon, which would have decreased photosynthesis.</p>
        <p>The findings were published in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The researchers say their study and others like it are important for understanding ancient ecosystems. The availability of less vegetation, for example, could have had an impact on plant-eating animals.</p>
        <p>For Crabs, Meals Ready to Eat</p>
        <p>In the children's book ''Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs,'' the residents of the mythical town of Chewandswallow are amazed at the manna that rains down from the heavens: spaghetti, hot dogs, mashed potatoes, pancakes, even brussels sprouts and Gorgonzola cheese.</p>
        <p>For crabs that live near hydrothermal vents in the shallow waters off Kueishan Island in northeastern Taiwan, their habitat is something of an undersea Chewandswallow. Twice a day when the tide is slack, dead plankton rain down from above, killed by toxic plumes from the vents. The crabs scurry from the cracks and crevasses where they spend their days, gorge for an hour or so on this all-you-can-eat feast, and then hurry back to their hiding places.</p>
        <p>This unique opportunistic behavior by the crab, Xenograpsus testudinatus, is described in the journal Nature by scientists from Singapore and Taiwan. But when the species was discovered five years ago, the researchers were mystified as to what exactly was going on.</p>
        <p>Several million of the crabs live in the area around the hydrothermal vents, which spew toxic gases and pure sulfur into the water. ''We wondered how such a terrible system can support so many crabs,'' said one of the researchers, Dr. Peter Ng, a biologist at the National University of Singapore. ''And why just crabs? There's nothing else there.''</p>
        <p>Then one of the researchers was diving in the area at slack tide, when normally strong currents cease. He noticed a ''snow'' of particles falling in the water column, accompanied by a small dead fish or two. At the same time, the crabs started swarming from their hiding places.</p>
        <p>Putting two and two together, the researchers realized what was going on. In the still water, the plume of hot, toxic water was traveling straight up from the vents, instantly killing all the plankton (and some larger creatures) in its way. The dead plankton then fell to the sea floor. At other times, the current both diluted the plume and swept any dead organisms away. ''It was so obvious,'' Dr. Ng said. ''We were sort of knocking ourselves on the head for not having thought of it before.''</p>
        <p>The researchers are now trying to learn how the crab times its feeding forays. It may have some sort of internal biological clock, Dr. Ng said, or a mechanism for detecting the change in current. ''It's another one of these unsolved mysteries,'' he said.</p>
