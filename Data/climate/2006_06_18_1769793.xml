        <p>TOO DARN HOT: Al Gore's new book, ''An Inconvenient Truth'' (Rodale) -- the companion volume to his documentary film of the same title -- makes its debut at No. 3 this week on the paperback nonfiction list. This isn't the first time Gore has been on the Times list with a book about the environment; back in 1992 and 1993, his ''Earth in the Balance'' spent six months here in hardcover and five more in paperback. ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' for all of its end-of-the-world vibe, is a deeply beautiful thing to behold; the photographs and illustrations are as eye-popping as an issue of Colors, the Benetton magazine. (The then-and-now photographs of various dwindling glaciers are particularly disturbing.) Gore is unsparing about the Bush administration's environmental record. ''In his very first week in office,'' he writes, ''President Bush reversed a campaign pledge to regulate CO2 emissions -- a pledge that had helped persuade many voters that he was genuinely concerned about matters relating to the environment.'' Bush's team ''launched an all-out effort to roll back, weaken and -- wherever possible -- completely eliminate existing laws and regulations.'' Gore gets hotter himself as he goes along, ultimately comparing global warming to Hitler's rise and quoting Churchill on the appeasement at Munich: ''This is only the first sip, the first foretaste of a bitter cup which will be proffered to us year by year -- unless by supreme recovery of moral health and martial vigor, we rise again.''</p>

        <p>FLUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER: ''Give me 6 orgasms within one hour and you can have 10. I swear it on the river Styx.'' That's a bit of dialogue from Sherrilyn Kenyon's new novel, ''Dark Side of the Moon'' (St. Martin's), which enters the hardcover fiction list this week at No. 7. Kenyon writes in a genre that is sometimes called ''paranormal romance.'' Her new book, the 10th in her ''Dark-Hunter'' series, is about a reporter whose cat turns out to be -- I am quoting from the jacket copy here -- ''a shapeshifter who claims to be an immortal vampire slayer.'' Kenyon would be harder to read if she didn't have a sense of humor. At one point, the reporter tells her editor: ''You had Joanie rewrite the story? The woman who wears tinfoil in her bra so that the people with X-ray vision can't see her breasts?'' Readers coming to these books for the first time may need help straightening out who's who -- or who's what -- in the ''Dark-Hunter'' universe. (''Ravyn's a Were-Hunter,'' one character explains, not entirely helpfully. ''They're cousins to the Apollites and to the Daimons who are hunted by the Dark-Hunters.'') Kenyon is obsessed with names; one of her earlier books is ''The Writer's Digest Character Naming Sourcebook,'' and she has children named Madaug and Cabal. The protagonist's name in this novel? It's Susan.</p>
