        <p>THE rumble of change is being heard in the coal fields of America.</p>
        <p>Utilities are exploring the costs and availability of lower-sulfur coal. Miners in central Appalachia and the western United States are contemplating big gains in production. Railroads expect a surge in shipments. And the high-sulfur mines of the Midwest and northern and southern Appalachia are looking at leaner times.</p>
        <p>Under the new Clean Air Act approved by Congress last month, restrictions on sulfur dioxide emissions, which contribute heavily to acid rain, will take effect in 1995 and tighten in 2000, with each round requiring more coal-burning utilities to find lower-sulfur fuel or to install scrubbers or other cleanup technology.</p>
        <p>These restriction have not previously been applied to old plants. By some estimates, one-eighth of the coal-burning plants in the United States will have to shift to different suppliers, sometimes more than 1,000 miles away. Supply relationships that have existed for decades will be disrupted.</p>
        <p>"This is going to be the biggest change in the use of coal at utilities in the past 50 years," said Scott B. Sitzer, an economist at the Department of Energy.</p>
        <p>Among producers, Ashland Coal will see compound annual earnings growth of 20 percent through 1995 because of increased demand for central Appalachian low-sulfur coal, said Rafael A. Villagran, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers. Another Appalachian producer, Westmoreland Coal, and a company in the Powder River Basin of northeast Wyoming, Nerco Inc., will also benefit, he said.</p>
        <p>The losers will probably be "mom-and-pop" mining companies that lack the resources to buy low-sulfur reserves or build the mines to produce them. Bigger companies may already have such reserves or be able to acquire them. The largest company, Peabody Holdings, a subsidiary of Hansen P.L.C., has big low-sulfur reserves in Montana, but offering that coal to its customers may mean a cut in profits. Because of daunting transportation costs, Western supplies, even with their attractive low sulfur levels, sell for less at the mine than do Peabody's extensive coal holdings in the East.</p>
        <p>Consolidation Coal, a subsidiary of Du Pont, is the second-largest American coal producer, and does not have extensive low-sulfur reserves, but it is regarded as highly efficient and, as one expert said, will "be the last guys to go."</p>
        <p>Among railroads, CSX and Norfolk Southern would benefit because they would haul more coal from central Appalachia, said Sandor J. Toth, senior analyst at the Fieldston Company, of Washington, a coal transportation publishing and consulting firm. In the West, Burlington Northern Union Pacific and Southern Pacific would haul more coal, he said.</p>
        <p>Eastern Enterprises, which owns the Midland Enterprises barge company, would also benefit, said Mr. Villagran of Shearson. Its barges ply a variety of inland waterways, including the Ohio and Mississippi rivers.</p>
        <p>AS for consumers, higher transportation charges and the cost of scrubbers will almost certainly push up electric rates sharply in places -- primarily in the Middle West -- now using high-sulfur coal. Coal accounted for 32.3 percent of the energy produced in the nation last year, and represents the vast majority of American fossil-fuel reserves. The United States has more than one-third of the world's coal reserves.</p>
        <p>When the Clean Air Act was first passed, in 1970, it meant big changes for new generating stations, but older coal-using plants were exempt.</p>
        <p>This time, all the older plants are affected, and some experts say that so many utilities will rush for new supplies at once that they will bid up the price of rail freight. The market for coal at the mine is also likely to change, with the now-modest price spread between low- and high-sulfur coals likely to widen. Similar price changes occurred in the oil market back when regulators set limits on sulfur dioxide emissions from oil-burning plants.</p>
        <p>C oal does not now operate in a national market. For one thing, the product varies sharply from deposit to deposit in energy content per pound and other factors, and most boilers can handle only a small range of coals. For another, proximity has historically been the most important determinant, with relatively little coal shipped over long distances.</p>
        <p>Currently, the difference in price between low-sulfur and high is small. In Eastern Kentucky, where high- and low-sulfur coals are available, the premium for low-sulfur is usually about 25 cents per million British thermal units, said A. Denny Ellerman, a vice president of Charles River Associates, a consulting firm. (A million B.T.U.'s is an amount of heat sufficient to make about 100 kilowatt-hours of electricity. That is a little less than the typical American household uses in a week.) But the premium exists only for the lowest-sulfur coals; intermediate grades actually sell for about the same as high-sulfur fuel.</p>
        <p>THE reason is that under the current regulations, a generating station is either in compliance or it is not; being most of the way there is of no help. The new act, however, allows averaging of the emissions of plants owned by the same utility.</p>
        <p>According to Department of Energy figures, coal-fired plants comprise 300 gigawatts of electrical capacity, or 44 percent of the total generating capacity. The balance includes plants fired by natural gas and oil, nuclear reactors and hydroelectric stations. The coal plants work more of the year, however, producing about 56 percent of the electricity.</p>
        <p>Of the total capacity of 300 gigawatts, 70 gigawatts are already treated with scrubbers, according to the Department of Energy. Additional plants with a total of 42 gigawatts of capacity will probably switch to lower-sulfur coal, and plants with 92 gigawatts of capacity will install scrubbers, said C. Hoff Stauffer Jr., a vice president of Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc.</p>
        <p>Shearson's estimate runs a little lower: plants with 40 gigawatts will switch fuels and plants with 55 to 60 gigawatts will add scrubbers.</p>
        <p>A few plants will try other solutions, like building new boilers that produce less pollution, or burning coal with natural gas to cut emissions. But under a system of emissions-trading approved by Congress, not every plant will have to change. A utility that adds a scrubber to its biggest, dirtiest plant would save so much sulfur dioxide that it could apply its "overcompliance" to smaller units that it did not clean up.</p>
        <p>Even with the wide expectation of large-scale coal switching, the low-sulfur coal producers are not rushing into new investments, however. At ARCO Coal, in Denver, which owns the Black Thunder mine, the biggest in the country, Curtis E. Burton, a spokesman, said the first step was to see which strategy the electric companies favor to comply with the new rules -- low-sulfur coal or scrubbers. "Every utility has to sit down and do some serious calculation, what makes sense for them to meet the new standards," Mr. Burton said.</p>
        <p>The Black Thunder mine, in the Powder River Basin in northeast Wyoming, produces nearly 30 million tons of coal a year, or about 3 percent of the United States' total. It is very low-sulfur coal, suitable for blending with high-sulfur coal to produce a mix that still burns with emissions below the Federal limit.</p>
        <p>AN ANALYSIS performed for the Environmental Protection Agency by ICF Resources Inc. in July predicted that a bill like the one that eventually passed Congress would cut coal production by up to 97 million tons from the high-sulfur areas of the Middle West and northern Appalachia by the year 2005, compared with what production would have been without a new law. The replacement coal would come mostly from central Appalachia, with some from the West. The Western coal is extremely low sulfur, below 0.7 percent; central Appalachian coal is between 0.7 and 2 percent.</p>
        <p>Companies in both the Appalachians and the Powder River Basin have ample capacity to produce low-sulfur coal and can expand capacity quickly, so big low-sulfur price changes are unlikely. Mr. Burton said his company foresaw "very small increases" in prices. Even with a higher demand for Powder River Basin coal, he said, competition would still be strong among producers of that type. "We're going to have to go out and hustle for every new piece of business," he said.</p>
        <p>A bigger barrier for Western coal is the cost of transportation. Delivery to power plants in the Middle West or Southeast can run as high as $25 a ton. Coal from the region generally sells for $5 to $7 a ton, so transportation can account for four-fifths of the delivered cost for the coal, although this is an extreme case; rail charges are usually closer to half the cost.</p>
        <p>But the effect of the Clean Air Act on the price of rail transport is hard to predict because costs are expected to rise sharply with volume, Mr. Toth said. If many utilities switch quickly to Western coal and begin hauling their fuel 1,500 miles instead of 200 miles, "you're talking about a lot of new cars, and a lot of new locomotives," he explained, adding, "Unless the railroads do some upgrading, we think there will be some problems."</p>
        <p>At the moment, Mr. Toth noted, "You can get rail rates from the Powder River Basin of a penny a pound a mile." And "Some utilities are going to make their investment decisions based on that number." That could turn out to be a big mistake. If railroad costs rise, he said, a trip that formerly cost $12 a ton could jump to $14.</p>
        <p>In any event, the railroads are reluctant to take major steps, he said, until it becomes clearer precisely what steps and what combinations of strategies the utilities are going to pursue, just how much low-sulfur coal will be shipped and how many new scrubbers will be installed instead.</p>
        <p>TRADING IN THE RIGHT TO POLLUTE</p>
        <p>THE new Clean Air Act will let coal-burning utilities produce, buy and sell something besides electricity: the right to pollute.</p>
        <p>In a system that has some economists cheering and utility regulators scratching their heads, the law will allow utilities to overcomply -- by reducing sulfur dioxide emissions below the legal limit -- and then "sell" the extra to another company.</p>
        <p>Suppose two companies each have to remove 1,000 tons of sulfur dioxide a year; one can do the job for $400 a ton, the other has to spend $600. The first can remove 2,000 tons and sell the extra reduction of 1,000 tons to the second company. If the price is more than $400, the first company makes a profit; if less than $600, the second company saves money.</p>
        <p>Scrubbers are, in fact, most cost-effective on big plants, especially the nation's 107 "big dirties," as they are known. A scrubber on a big dirty might cut sulfur-dioxide emission by 99 percent -- from 5 pounds per million British thermal units, say, to 0.05 pounds. Since the standard, when fully phased in, is 1.2 pounds, a plant that installed a scrubber would have 1.15 pounds to sell or to store against problems that might come up in the future.</p>
        <p>Estimates vary on the worth of this pollution commodity, but Paul R. Portney of Resources for the Future, in Washington, puts the figure at about $2.5 billion.</p>
        <p>"There is a shared savings," said Ashley C. Brown of the Ohio Public Utilities Commission, adding that savings can reduce rates.</p>
        <p>But it is not clear who should benefit, shareholder or consumer. Normally, electric customers pay for all construction through their electric bills, and get the benefit in available electricity. They could be asked to pay for extra anti-pollution equipment, and, indeed, get the benefit in reduced rates if the pollution trade works.</p>
        <p>But there will be some risk, both in trading in the volatile energy market and in using machinery that can quickly become obsolete. If the trade goes bad -- if the utility, say, finds itself having spent more to create a pollution credit than it can sell the credit for -- then the investment might be judged imprudent by state regulators. In that case, shareholders might have to eat the loss in the form of reduced dividends.</p>
        <p>Should the shareholder be asked to assume that level of risk without the possibility of gain?</p>
