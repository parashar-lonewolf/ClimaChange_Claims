      <block class="full_text">
        <p>George W. Bush, who came to the presidency vowing to change the tone of Washington and the policies of his predecessor, has found that Washington has compelled him to change as well, both by moderating his own tone and by accepting compromises on some of his top priorities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has been widely praised for his administration's discipline, the speed with which he won consensus for what will likely prove to be one of the biggest tax cuts since the Reagan era, and the largely successful way he faced his first foreign challenge, an unexpected confrontation with China. Not surprisingly, Mr. Bush has given himself high marks.</p>
        <p>''There's less name-calling and finger-pointing,'' he said today in a radio address on the eve of his 100th day in office. ''We're sharing credit. We are learning we can make our points without making enemies.''</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Bush is also discovering that presidents must pick their fights with care. Quietly, often denying it along the way, Mr. Bush has been forced because of Congressional opposition to excise school vouchers from his education proposals and shelve the idea of drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which he once called an essential element of a national energy policy. And in the last few days, after adamantly insisting for so long that $1.6 trillion was ''the right number'' for a tax cut over the next 10 years, he has begun to concede that he will have to settle for a smaller figure.</p>
        <p>''He knew the moment would come to compromise,'' a top Bush adviser  said the other day. ''It's just come a little faster than some anticipated.''</p>
        <p>The changes in Mr. Bush's approach are subtle, and his aides insist that he is governing the nation with the same principles and approach he used in governing Texas. His detractors say otherwise; that he has proven far more conservative in the White House than he appeared as a candidate.</p>
        <p>But even his critics say he is a far more confident leader than he was on Jan. 20, something he demonstrated in Quebec last weekend, when he handled questions on Latin American politics, drugs and trade issues with a degree of subtlety that was missing in his first days in the White House.</p>
        <p>Yet he has begun to discover, as most presidents do, that the world  looks far more complicated from inside the Oval Office than it did from the campaign trail.</p>
        <p>Just a year ago he was denouncing the Clinton administration for pouring money into every failing economy around the world; last weekend  he told a journalist from Argentina that he might consider helping prop up her country's troubled economy. A few days later he did exactly that for Turkey.</p>
        <p>His face-off with China early this month gave him a boost in approval  ratings for defusing a potentially explosive situation, but his comments  since about China and Taiwan, which weaved toward a change of policy and then back again, have shown his continuing unease.</p>
        <p>''He's still searching for the right tone for talking to the world,'' one senior aide concedes.</p>
        <p>At home that tone is friendly but studiously unemotive, more Eisenhower than Reagan. But when it comes to courting conservatives who doubted if he was a true believer, it is Mr. Reagan who most comes to mind. Even conservatives say they have been surprised at the degree to which Mr. Bush has sought their views, incorporated their policies and placed them in prominent posts.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Reagan, he is a delegator. But Mr. Reagan never made use of the president's father, who was Mr. Reagan's vice president, the way George W. Bush makes use of Vice President Dick Cheney. Because Mr. Cheney is an older, more experienced hand with no presidential ambitions of his own, his behind-the-scenes role appears difficult to overstate. He is running Mr. Bush's energy review and is expected to play an important role in shaping Mr. Bush's thinking on national missile defense, which Mr. Bush will discuss in a speech on Tuesday. And Mr. Cheney  remains the White House's main channel to Congress and the conservative media.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney also plays a role, some aides say, in calming Mr. Bush, who angers more quickly than his father did, especially when the White House wanders from its prepared scripts.</p>
        <p>''George W. Bush has a little more of his mother in him,'' says Andrew H. Card Jr., the White House chief of staff, who worked in the previous Bush White House. ''Where his father would bite his tongue,'' Mr. Card said, ''every once in a while George W. Bush flaps his tongue. His emotions are a little more visible for those of us who work with him. I know when he's upset. His father masked it. You learn when you're in the doghouse a little earlier now than you did with his dad.''</p>
        <p>A Premium on Charm</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush went into office believing that likability would count a lot in Washington, just as it did in Texas. For a month, he was right. He handed out nicknames, unveiled a birthday cake for the House minority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, and invited the Kennedy family over for hamburgers and a viewing of ''Thirteen Days.'' Members of the Black Congressional Caucus, no friend of Republicans, were invited for a grievance session, and Mr. Bush listened intently.</p>
        <p>In his radio address today, he claimed to be marking ''100 days of Congress and the president working together.''</p>
        <p>But in the last three months, as introductions have given way to negotiations and negotiations to open conflict, Mr. Bush has discovered that in Washington, good feelings do not translate into legislative majorities.</p>
        <p>Consider the case of Representative George Miller, a Democrat from California and a senior member of the House committee that oversees education. Mr. Miller backed major elements of the president's education overhaul plan and helped the president show he had allies in both parties. Mr. Bush called him Big George and praised his intellect and bipartisan spirit.</p>
        <p>The two men seemed genuinely to  hit it off.</p>
        <p>But listen to Big George now. ''In the first few weeks he did reach out to Democrats,'' Mr. Miller said. ''But we all wondered whether he would keep it up when it was time to get down to business. As it turns out, the White House went off and took a series of unilateral actions that ended any good feelings there may have been. President Bush is very friendly. Many of his policies have been less so.''</p>
        <p>Today Mr. Miller disparages Mr. Bush's environmental policies and accuses him of underfinancing education.</p>
        <p>On Monday, when Mr. Bush will offer lunch to all 100 senators and 435 representatives, Mr. Miller and many other Democrats say they have other plans.</p>
        <p>Was the strategy a failure?</p>
        <p>''It's not a strategy,'' said Karl Rove, the president's chief political adviser. ''We're not trying to win the afternoon news cycle. We are trying to drain some of the hyperpartisanship out of the system. He will continue to do what he has done.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rove knew from the start that chatting up members of Congress  would not be enough, so he came up with a parallel approach: Have the  president visit key states around the country, where he could put maximum pressure on wavering members of Congress.</p>
        <p>The result has been a blitz of travel. In the first 100 days, Mr. Bush has visited 26 states, what appears to be a modern record for the start of a presidency.</p>
        <p>Such visits always get big local coverage, as do Mr. Cheney's weekly calls to talk-radio programs. But only occasionally do they get much  national coverage. And there is a  sense among many in Washington that Mr. Bush's presidency seems somehow smaller in the life of the nation. Historians like Michael Beschloss have compared it to the presidencies in the late part of the 19th century, when often the occupant of the White House did not have much to say in public.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush says he does not feel compelled to show up on television  ''every hour of every day.'' He was happy to let his attorney general, John Ashcroft, make the public statements about the administration's view of the rioting in Cincinnati after the shooting of a black teenager by the police. Mr. Bush deliberately skipped the homecoming ceremony near Seattle for the 24 United States military personnel detained by the Chinese, saying it was a moment for family reunions, not for a president hogging the limelight.</p>
        <p>Nor does Mr. Bush put on formal news conferences in the East Room, a favorite setting for past presidents. He prefers quick, impromptu questioning when meeting foreign or Congressional leaders. He has held two news conferences in the press room at very short notice. ''We think that the president is taking as many or more questions than his predecessors did,'' said Karen P. Hughes, one of the inner circle of advisers. ''But it's in his style.'' That style makes it easy, however, to duck queries he does not want to hear, or feels unready to answer.</p>
        <p>First Up, Taxes</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's steadfast drive toward his first goal, a big tax cut, dominated his first 100 days in office. It will not be as big as he likes, as he now  acknowledges. But his constant insistence that a large chunk of the surplus should be returned to the American people in the form of deep tax cuts wore down Democrats. Mr. Bush almost crows these days that during the campaign ''a lot of the punditry kind of had a blank stare on their face'' when he talked about tax cuts. ''They thought I was, as they say, whistling into the wind,'' he told an enthusiastic rally at a New Orleans baseball stadium on Wednesday. Now, he said, ''tax relief is on the way.''</p>
        <p>And despite the administration's repeated warnings of a possible recession, as the first 100 days come to a close, Mr. Bush has some reason to believe that he may have avoided a politically dangerous economic downturn.</p>
        <p>But if Mr. Bush changed the tone of Washington on taxes, he has failed to win support for his view of how to approach environmental issues: an insistence, born of his business experience in Texas, that any regulation must be carefully weighed against its potential costs.</p>
        <p>Publicly Mr. Bush's aides insist that the president has been unfairly tarred as anti-environment: He simply wanted ''good science'' to dictate how to change rules on arsenic levels; he was ''realistic'' in declaring the Kyoto treaty on global warming dead. Inside the White House, the regulations President Bill Clinton left on everything from roadless areas in the national forests to workplace ergonomic rules are derisively called ''regulatory pardons.''</p>
        <p>In backing away from them, Mr. Bush revealed a blind spot in the  administration's political view, one that is evident from polls showing that a growing number of Americans are worried that the president thinks more about his corporate supporters than the environment.</p>
        <p>''We should have done a better job in setting the stage for the decisions the president made,'' Mr. Card now says.</p>
        <p>The mistake has left Mr. Bush  retrenching, emphasizing in his radio talk today that he let stand ''sensible rules'' on lead emissions, wetlands, pesticides, and pollution from diesel engines.</p>
        <p>A Wavering Voice Abroad</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush rarely travels these days without one aide at his side: Condoleezza Rice, the former Stanford provost who, as national security adviser, has taken on the role of tutoring Mr. Bush on the complexities of a broader world he is learning about on the job.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Rice cannot teach him how to navigate a deep fracture in his own party, between a business community that wants him to focus on economic integration and conservatives who argue that America has been taken for a ride by Russia and China, and needs to flex its muscles as the world's sole superpower.</p>
        <p>So far, Mr. Bush has bridged this division by sounding both themes. In the China standoff he took a tough line in the first two days, then eased back and talked of the economic damage that bad relations would wreak on both countries. With the crew of the American spy plane out of China, he has veered again, walking to the edge of redefining a willingness to defend Taiwan, then insisting that the policy has not changed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush also had trouble controlling his language on dealing with  North Korea, and angered Europe by giving no warning on his declaration  that the Kyoto treaty would be scrapped. Foreign leaders say they like him but worry about his experience. ''I left wondering whether he had read his briefing papers,'' said one participant in his recent meeting with the president of Chile.</p>
        <p>While he has met with the leaders of many important friendly countries, including Japan, Germany, Britain, Canada and Mexico, and even made time last week to sip coffee for an hour with the prime minister of St. Kitts (population  39,000), Mr. Bush has yet to sit down with Vladimir V. Putin of Russia or Jiang Zemin of China.</p>
