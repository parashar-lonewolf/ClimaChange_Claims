        <p>IF it is rainy or overcast for a week, Lyle Rawlings has to tell his sons to turn off the television. That is because his house is electrified solely by the sun, and the battery stores only enough power for about 10 days.</p>
        <p>At Mr. Rawlings' house -- nestled in this rural community in southeastern Hunterdon County -- the sun also provides the heat. The southern exposure is full of windows, and there are none on the north side. The effect on a bright October morning is of a house literally bathed in sunshine.</p>
        <p>To show exactly how much power is left, there is an indicator in the kitchen. When it flashes orange, Mr. Rawlings has to be careful. If it ever turns red, he is in trouble. But when it's green and blinking, it means the battery is full and the sun is producing more energy than is needed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rawlings, a lean man with a trim gray beard, says the balancing act is worth it. He lives a modern, gadget-filled life, yet he is still intimitately connected to nature. On overcast days, his passive solar house is a bit chilly. But when the sun is shining, he can enjoy the bounty of nature in a way most people cannot.</p>
        <p>''We can truly experience the natural phenomenon of abundance,'' said Mr. Rawlings, who lives here with his two sons. ''We have more energy than we can possibly use, and it's free. I might leave the stereo on and bake bread all day long.''</p>
        <p>Electricity was first harnessed here in New Jersey by Thomas Edison, whose most important technological contribution was, arguably, neither the light bulb nor the phonograph, but the electric grid. It was Edison who first envisioned the world we live in today, in which a person can light the darkness with a flick of a switch, powered by energy from an invisible source far away.</p>
        <p>Edison's innovation has been so successful that few people today can imagine being off the grid, even for a short time. Mr. Rawlings is one who can.</p>
        <p>These are boom times for Mr. Rawlings, who is in the business of installing solar power systems, because New Jersey is underwriting a revolution in energy that could rival Edison's contribution a century ago. The state has a $1 billion program in place to jump-start the renewable energy industry here -- primarily solar, but also through other means like wind -- offering rebates of 50 to 60 percent to homeowners and businesses who install new systems.</p>
        <p>The program is part of the legislation passed two years ago to deregulate electricity in the state, and it is run by the New Jersey Clean Energy Program, which is made up of utility companies as well as the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental organization. Most residents, if they know about the program at all, are aware of it because of a postcard they received in the mail printed in tones of gold and orange and featuring a photograph of a daisy with the words: ''A special invitation from PSE&amp;G just for you. Learn how solar electricity works. How it can benefit you and the environment. How you can get started.''</p>
        <p>Partly through coincidence, Mr. Rawlings happens to be surrounded by neighbors who share his vision. For instance, his house is just one of three on his street that feature composting toilets like the kind found in state parks. The other two belong to Cassandra Kling, who was recently hired by the state Board of Public Utilities to help sell the public on renewable energy, and Dante DiPirro, legal policy advisor to Bradley Campbell, commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection.</p>
        <p>Another neighbor, David Eisenbud, sells solar energy systems for the PowerLight Corporation, based in Berkely, Calif. A fifth, Mike Strizki, is a tinkerer and advocate of hydrogen-powered cars.</p>
        <p>Call it Solar Alley. For their part, the residents of Syndertown Road here call it Sustainability Street. And there may be more Sustainability Streets soon.</p>
        <p>As Cassandra Wilson's boss, Jeanne Fox, president of the state Board of Public Utilities, puts it, '''New Jersey is the solar capital of the East Coast.''</p>
        <p>Meetings sponsored by Public Service Electric and Gas to teach the public about solar energy are held in the conference room of its training and development center in Edison, a nondescript building down a long driveway in a stark compound surrounded by a high mesh fence. Inside, all is friendly, with a small buffet of sandwiches, chips and giant cookies to reward those who are willing to venture out in the evening for a lecture on solar power. There is also a table of literature from vendors in the solar business, including the industry leader, BP Solar. Salesmen line the back of the room, arms folded, chatting, telling jokes and eyeing the crowd like car salesmen on the edges of the showroom.</p>
        <p>The lights are dimmed and the slide show starts. Slide one: ''Enough solar energy falls on New Jersey in one day to power the state for one year.</p>
        <p>What follows is a lecture by Gay Canough, a particle physicist and New York-based solar vendor herself. She holds up photovoltaic panels, which for the most part are shiny and blue, and explains that most people who take advantage of the New Jersey rebate will stay on the grid. Their meters will run backward when solar power is being received: in effect, selling their power back to the utility companies.</p>
        <p>'Hard to Justify Financially'</p>
        <p>Bob McCoy, 47, wearing a flannel shirt and jeans, will be a taker. Although Mr. McCoy lives in a Victorian house in Maplewood, where those shiny blue panels would not seem to be a natural part of the exterior, he wants to install them on his garage, hidden deep in his back yard.</p>
        <p>A month after the session in Edison, Mr. McCoy has contacted five vendors, and decided to go with Jersey Solar LLC. The system will run $23,490 -- but with the state rebate, Mr. McCoy expects to pay just $9,556.</p>
        <p>Generating solar electricity from photovoltaic panels on his garage will save Mr. McCoy $550 a year -- at least if the price of electricity remains what it is -- which means it will take him about 18 years to pay back his investment. On the other hand, the price of electricity is almost sure to rise -- some estimate by as much as 20 percent -- when rate caps come off in August. Still, $9,556 is an considerable amount for Mr. McCoy, who is staying at home caring for his son and daughter, while his wife works.</p>
        <p>''It's a big plunk of cash down on a belief almost,'' Mr. McCoy explained. ''It's hard to justify financially.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. McCoy does not look at it solely in financial terms. He looks at it like the bicyclist, hiker and self-avowed environmentalist that he is.</p>
        <p>''I don't consider the price we pay for electricity the full social cost of it,'' he said. ''The power we're replacing comes from a combination of coal, nuclear and burned garbage. Having clean air -- how much is that worth?''</p>
        <p>It is not surprising that sunny California, which over the last decade has experienced shortages of electricity, rolling blackouts and wild rises in price would be the country's biggest market for solar energy.</p>
        <p>But New Jersey?</p>
        <p>According to Todd Foley, a spokesman for BP Solar, the biggest player in the $2.5 billion annual worldwide solar energy market, New Jersey ranks only behind California in its embrace of solar energy.</p>
        <p>''New Jersey has one of the nation's leading incentive programs,'' he said.</p>
        <p>New Jersey's commitment to solar came about as part of the Electric Discount and Energy Competition Act, passed three years ago to deregulate the state's electric utilities and open competition. But according to Hal Bozarth, executive director of the Chemistry Council of New Jersey, an industry group that lobbied for the legislation, alternative energy was not exactly at the heart of the debate.</p>
        <p>''It was almost an afterthought,'' Mr. Bozarth said. ''Most legislators considered it a minor part of the bill.''</p>
        <p>And Mr. Bozarth is not happy about the way legislation has played out. He contends that electricity rates in the state are still 50 percent above the national average and the third- or fourth-highest in the nation. As a major reason for the measure's failure, Mr. Bozarth cites a relationship between regulators and the utilities that is too cozy. ''The Board of Public Utilities is in the same building in Newark as PSE&amp;G,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Also, he said, putting the energy program in the hands of the utilities is ''clearly, clearly a conflict of interest.''</p>
        <p>''The last thing they want,'' he added, referring to the utility companies, ''is people figuring out technology that will wean them away from the grid.''</p>
        <p>Furthermore, since utilities can publish material on solar energy on their own letterhead, it is a great public relations boon -- even though they are only administering state funds.</p>
        <p>''It's the ratepayers subsidizing a bit of propaganda on their behalf to make them look good,'' Mr. Bozarth said.</p>
        <p>Some liken the situation to having General Motors in charge of an effort to get more people to ride bikes to work. ''Solar and wind run counter to their fundamental interest,'' said Mr. Rawlings.</p>
        <p>Even Jeanne Fox, the president of the state Board of Public Utilities, said in a recent telephone interview that she planned to recommend a change in the way the New Jersey Clean Energy Program was administered. The utilities should still be involved, Ms. Fox said, but ''not predominate.''</p>
        <p>Flawed or not, the state's commitment to alternative energy is real.</p>
        <p>''New Jersey is very much an environmentally oriented state,'' said Ms. Fox, who comes to her current cabinet position from the federal Environmental Protection Agency, where she was a regional administrator. ''We're not California, but I really think that's where the public is leaning. Green Acres bond issues always pass. Teachers teach it at school. It's something we're raised on in New Jersey.''</p>
        <p>That resolve was evident last month, when New Jersey joined the six New England states and New York in suing the Bush administration over its proposal to relax air pollution standards. Clean air is one of the primary reasons for supporting solar and wind energy, because they can provide power without burning anything.</p>
        <p>New Jersey also recently won the 2002 Green Power Leadership Award from the Environmental Protection Agency and the federal Department of Energy for its contract with Green Mountain Energy to provide 86 million kilowatt hours a year of ''green'' energy -- some of it from windmills in Pennsylvania -- to power state government offices.</p>
        <p>The state also supports solar energy for reasons that have nothing to do with the environment. ''Security and energy independence,'' said Ms. Fox, who also serves on Governor McGreevey's Domestic Security Preparedness Task Force.</p>
        <p>What Edison did not figure on when he invented the grid was that some day the United States would have to contend with OPEC -- and far worse, terrorists who might find bombing nuclear generation plants or otherwise disrupting electric service to be an ideal way to spread chaos.</p>
        <p>Another reason the state supports solar is that it is a stabilizing influence on the infrastructure, since it is most abundant when it is needed most, during the summer heat waves, when all those air-conditioners make the electrical grid most unstable.</p>
        <p>Whatever the motivations and politics of the state's energy program, the biggest effect will come from large corporations like Johnson &amp; Johnson, which has an enormous commitment to solar energy. The company has a solar power system at its Cordis plant in Warren that produces 76,000 kilowatt hours of electricity a year. In addition, a new solar energy system is being installed at a subsidiary, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, in Titusville. Those photovoltaic panels will produce 521,000 kilowatt hours a year -- the equivalent of the annual energy consumption of 86 homes.</p>
        <p>''New Jersey has been one of the leading states in the country,'' said Harry Kauffman, energy director for Johnson &amp; Johnson. ''We are getting significant rebates through the New Jersey program.''</p>
        <p>An Opportunity for the Union</p>
        <p>Until now, the biggest solar installation has been at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 269 headquarters in Trenton. ''Even though it's a little on the expensive side,'' said Charles Marciante, the local's business manager, ''I can see it's going to be a job opportunity for my members.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Marciante has been frustrated by some political snags. He said that a state grant to teach electricians about solar energy, originally set at $90,000, then reduced to $64,000, was held up by a dispute with the state's Labor Department because of an unrelated issue.</p>
        <p>''They're basically holding it hostage,'' he said. ''We basically said, 'Forget it.' ''</p>
        <p>He said that the union local has proceeded with its solar training using its own funds. In the meantime, he added, the union is still waiting for $250,000 in reimbursement from Public Service Electric and Gas for its solar installation. ''It's been nothing but a nightmare,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fox said that by the end of 2003, installations providing 3 megawatts of solar power -- enough to power 6,000 residential homes for a year -- will have been built under the New Jersey Clean Energy Program, including installations already operating and those in the pipeline.</p>
        <p>And that could just be the start.</p>
        <p>''I believe that New Jersey can become a solar leader in the country,'' said Mr. Eisenbud of PowerLight, pointing to a resource that most people now see as an aesthetic blight -- the warehouse rooftops off Exit 8A of the New Jersey Turnpike. To advocates of solar energy, those enormous flat rooftops are electricity production plants waiting to happen.</p>
        <p>''You're talking at least 20 megawatts of capacity,'' Mr. Eisenbud said. ''Or more.''</p>
