        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Ra√∫l Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'CURTAINS' This musical comedy about a musical-comedy murder -- featuring songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Rupert Holmes -- lies on the stage like a promisingly gaudy string of firecrackers, waiting in vain for a match. The good news is that David Hyde Pierce, playing a diffident Boston detective, steps into full-fledged Broadway stardom. Scott Ellis directs a talent-packed cast that includes Debra Monk and Karen Ziemba. (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DEUCE' Back on Broadway for the first time in 25 years, Angela Lansbury is so vitally and indelibly present that she even gives flesh to this flimsy comedy. Terrence McNally's play, about the reunion of two former doubles partners (Ms. Lansbury and Marian Seldes), is a jerry-built shrine to enduring star power. Directed by Michael Blakemore (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'FROST/NIXON' Frank Langella turns in a truly titanic performance as Richard M. Nixon in Peter Morgan's briskly entertaining, if all-too-tidy, play about the former president's annihilating television interviews with the British talk show host David Frost (the excellent Michael Sheen). Michael Grandage directs with the momentum of a ticking-bomb thriller and the zing of a boulevard comedy (1:40). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'INHERIT THE WIND' Doug Hughes's wooden revival of this worthy war horse, based on the Scopes ''monkey'' trial of 1925, never musters much more velocity than a drugstore fan. Be grateful that the cast includes Christopher Plummer, in savory form as a Will Rogers of jurisprudence. An oddly subdued Brian Dennehy plays his pompous adversary (2:00). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40).Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'LEGALLY BLONDE' This nonstop sugar rush of a musical about a powder puff who finds her inner power-broker, based on the 2001 film, approximates the experience of eating a jumbo bag of Gummi Bears in one sitting. Flossing between songs is recommended (2:20). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'LOVEMUSIK' As Lotte Lenya and Kurt Weill, Donna Murphy and Michael Cerveris turn in stunningly shaded performances in what is, alas, a sluggish, mixed-up bio-musical. Scored with an eclectic sampler of Weill's songs, ''LoveMusik'' strives to achieve chilly distance and cozy intimacy in the same breath. Harold Prince directs; Alfred Uhry wrote the conventionally sentimental book (2:40). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'LES MIS√âRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'A MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN' Kevin Spacey gives a bizarre, beat-the-clock performance, as lively as a frog on a hot plate, as James Tyrone in this off-kilter revival of Eugene O'Neill's last play. Mercifully, he does not block the view of Eve Best, who maps the contradictory levels of Tyrone's strapping love interest with clarity and intelligence (2:50). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'110 IN THE SHADE' Is it possible for a performance to be too good? Audra McDonald brings such breadth of skill and depth of feeling to Lonny Price's lukewarm revival of this musical about a love-starved spinster that she threatens to burst the seams of this small, homey musical. She's an overwhelming presence in an underwhelming show (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PIRATE QUEEN' How to river-dance your way to the bottom of the ocean, courtesy of the songwriters of ''Les Mis√©rables'' (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'RADIO GOLF' The final -- and in dramatic terms, the weakest -- of August Wilson's magnificent 10-play cycle about the African-American experience, ''Radio Golf'' has the crackle of a bustling comedy. But this tale of getting and spending in the 1990s, directed by Kenny Leon, throbs with a lament for a lost time, a lost culture, a lost language (2:30). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING' Joan Didion's arresting but ultimately frustrating adaptation of her best-selling memoir about being blindsided by grief, starring Vanessa Redgrave. The tension between style and emotional content that made the book such a stunner does not translate to the stage. The substance here is in the silences, when the focus shifts from words to Ms. Redgrave's wry, wounded face (1:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'ALL THE WRONG REASONS: A TRUE STORY OF NEO-NAZIS, DRUG SMUGGLING AND UNDYING LOVE' John Fugelsang's amiable solo show mixes memoir and stand-up comedy in a tale of family, faith and Roman Catholic guilt. Slight but engaging (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 460-5475. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'BE' A high-energy, low-content Israeli show that blends music, dance and sex appeal in the latest attempt to tap into the ''Stomp'' market (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'BILL W. AND DR. BOB' This insightful new play about the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous subtly makes the claim that the recovery movement was born as a series of accidents. Patrick Husted is excellent as Bob Smith, Bill Wilson's partner in combating addictions (2:15). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Ginia Bellafante)</p>
        <p>* 'BLACKBIRD'  David Harrower's stunning new drama looks back at a sexual relationship -- between a 40-year-old man and a 12-year-old girl -- that transforms, cripples and paralyzes. Jeff Daniels and Alison Pill, both extraordinary, peel their characters down to their barest souls. Joe Mantello is the masterly director (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE BRIG' Serious students of the stage will want to check out the Living Theater's first revival since 1963 of Kenneth H. Brown's docudrama about the soul-shredding grind of daily life in a Marine Corps prison, once again directed by the company co-founder Judith Malina. One of the most celebrated productions in the company's history, ''The Brig'' harks back to an era when theater was at the forefront of both political and artistic radicalism (2:00). Living Theater, 21 Clinton Street, Lower East Side. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'CIRKUS INFERNO' Happy lunacy (1:00). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)</p>
        <p>'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'GASLIGHT' The Irish Repertory Theater's revival of Patrick Hamilton's 1938 thriller about a husband intent on driving his wife mad strips away the claustrophobia and ably resists clich√©d feminist interpretation. As the impish detective who saves the day, Brian Murray is the play's great leavening agent. He prompts the heroine to whiskey drinking, and you want to raise a glass to him (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Bellafante)</p>
        <p>* 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE J.A.P. SHOW: JEWISH AMERICAN PRINCESSES of comedy' Laughs along with longueurs (1:30). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Van Gelder)</p>
        <p>'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Anita Gates)</p>
        <p>'MOTHER LOAD' In her one-woman show on the perils of affluent motherhood, Amy Wilson derides the culture of obsessive child-rearing as she chronicles her submission to it. An affable presence onstage, Ms. Wilson nevertheless mines overly clich√©d territory: the nut allergies, the horrors of preschool admission, the importance of knowing two languages by the time you are 3. Posters on Urbanbaby.com will find themselves amusedly looking in the mirror. All other New Yorkers will find themselves wanting to move to Patagonia (1:15). Sage Theater, 711 Seventh Avenue, at 47th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante)</p>
        <p>'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY'  Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30).Westside Theater Downstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)</p>
        <p>* 'PASSING STRANGE' The composer and performer Stew narrates this semiautobiographical show about a songwriter on a journey of self-discovery. Part rock concert, part book musical, it flows smoothly on a strong current of feeling and humor as the Los Angeles-born central character searches for his musical voice in the hash bars of Amsterdam and the cabarets of Berlin (2:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Off Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'T J AND DAVE' The comics T. J. Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance. This is an impressive feat of mental athletics, but the results are also observant, complex and frequently enormously funny (1:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)</p>
        <p>Long-Running Shows</p>
        <p>'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing CliffsNotes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE'  A pasteboard pastiche of 1920's musicals, as remembered by a witty show queen(1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Often more entertaining than the real thing (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'JERSEY BOYS'  The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'SPAMALOT'  A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'TARZAN'  A writhing green blob with music (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 254 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>'BEAUTY ON THE VINE' Zak Berkman presents muddled politics and distorted anxieties in his quasi-science-fiction play about the influence of plastic surgery on young women who start modeling themselves after a right-wing radio host. Adding to the atmosphere of hysteria is the inability of the actors onstage to render a single subtle or nuanced moment (2:10). Harold Clurman Theater, 412 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Bellafante)</p>
        <p>'DAUGHTER OF A CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY' A standard-issue solo play about a fascinating Cuban family (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200; closes tomorrow. (Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'GOD'S EAR' Jenny Schwartz's formally inventive and brilliantly performed drama about how the death of a child affects a family is more interested in language than in narrative (1:20). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444; closes tomorrow. (Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'I LOVE YOU , YOU'RE PERFECT, NOW CHANGE!' This revue has proved as indestructible as the truisms about men and women on which it is based: it has run for 11 years Off Broadway and spread around the world. Now one of its avatars is coming for a visit: the Mandarin production with Lin Yilun, a major Chinese star, has arrived in New York for a limited run, playing concurrently with the English version. This is supposedly the first time a foreign production of an American musical has played in the United States (and the first Chinese-language production of a major American musical). It will be interesting to see how the piece's hoary stereotypes change in translation; Joel Bishoff, the original director, modified the work to reflect Chinese culture for its Shanghai run (2:00). The Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; Mandarin version closes on Sunday. (Anne Midgette)</p>
        <p>'NO CHILD'  Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'SILVERLAND' Global warming and the melting of the ice caps have destroyed London in this environmentally (if not dramatically) aware debut. Part of the Brits Off Broadway festival (2:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman)</p>

        <p>'AMU' (No rating, 102 minutes, in English, Bengali, Hindi and Punjabi) This ambitious first feature by Shonali Bose, about Kaju, a young Indian-American woman searching for the real India and for her roots, begins as a gentle comedy of cultures clashing. Its true topic, though, is the riots that broke out in Delhi in 1984 after Indira Gandhi's assassination. Thousands of Sikhs were killed, and as Kaju learns, justice has been delayed and denied. (Rachel Saltz)</p>
        <p>'ANGEL-A' (R, 90 minutes) Beneath its sophisticated Gallic gloss, this handsomely photographed feel-good fantasy, which shamelessly recycles ''It's a Wonderful Life'' and ''Heaven Can Wait,'' suggests an episode of ''Touched by an Angel'' without the tears. (Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'AWAY FROM HER' (PG-13, 110 minutes) Sarah Polley's well-observed adaptation of a story by Alice Munro is a quiet tour de force about love and loss, anchored by fine performances by Gordon Pinsent and Julie Christie as a couple dealing with the loss of memory and memories of past hurt. (A. O. Scott)</p>
        <p>'BLADES OF GLORY' (PG-13, 93 minutes) In this fast, light, frequently funny comedy about a male figure-skating team, Will Ferrell and Jon Heder stake an early claim to being the comedy couple of the year. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'THE BOSS OF IT ALL' (No rating, 99 minutes, in Danish) To describe ''The Boss of It All,'' Lars von Trier's acidic corporate comedy, as '' 'The Office' viewed through the looking glass'' only scratches the surface of the newest film from one of the foremost tricksters of world cinema. (Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'BRAND UPON THE BRAIN' (No rating, 96 minutes) A baroque entertainment with one foot in silent cinema and the other gingerly toeing the sound waves, Guy Maddin's latest centers on a man who, in visiting a now-emptied foundling home, journeys deep into his childhood. It's wild! It's weird! It's strangely touching and a total must-see! (Manohla Dargis)</p>
        <p>'BROOKLYN RULES' (R, 99 minutes) However authentic and heartfelt this film's depiction of life on the meaner streets of the Northeast corridor may be, its story of three friends growing up in a mob-infested Brooklyn neighborhood doesn't begin to match ''The Sopranos'' in its epic vision of violence, class struggle and upward mobility in a barbarous culture. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'BUG' (R, 102 minutes) In this overwrought psychodrama from the director William Friedkin, Ashley Judd's acting continues to surpass her career choices. Playing a shaky Oklahoma barmaid, she convincingly juggles an abusive husband (Harry Connick Jr.) and a newfound lover (Michael Shannon) who sees creepy-crawlies in the mattress and conspiracies everywhere. Though the movie's escalating hysteria may strain credulity, Ms. Judd has never been more believable as a woman condemned to attract the wrong kind of man. (Jeannette Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'DAY NIGHT DAY NIGHT' (No rating, 94 minutes) For most of its 94 minutes, this gripping but evasive portrait of an unidentified 19-year-old terrorist undertaking a suicide bombing mission in Times Square focuses on the face of its star, Luisa Williams. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'DISTURBIA' (PG-13, 104 minutes) A pleasant, scary, well-directed variation on the killer-next-door theme, with the engaging Shia LeBeouf as Kale, a young man who turns house arrest into an occasion for voyeurism and crime-fighting. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'EVEN MONEY' (R, 108 minutes) This grim, lurid scare movie about gambling addiction consists of several interlocking horror stories that converge in a format similar to that of ''Crash.'' More than its forerunner, this film sacrifices realism to forced plot mechanics. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'FAY GRIM' (R, 118 minutes) Too light-headed to qualify as satire, too poker-faced to register as comedy, this elaborate spy spoof, a sequel to ''Henry Fool,'' belongs in its own stylistic niche: the Hal Hartley film. Movies emanating from Planet Hartley are an acquired taste shared by hipper-than-thou insiders. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'FRACTURE' (R, 111 minutes) A glib entertainment that offers up the spectacle of that crafty scene-stealer Anthony Hopkins mixing it up with that equally cunning screen-nibbler Ryan Gosling. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'GEORGIA RULE' (R, 111 minutes) Jane Fonda, Felicity Huffman and Lindsay Lohan play three generations of strong-willed, dysfunctional women in this comedy-melodrama from Garry Marshall. It's a mess, but it does have some vitality, thanks mainly to Ms. Fonda and Ms. Lohan. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'GRINDHOUSE' (R, 180 minutes) A double feature, complete with fake previews for schlocky exploitation pictures, that pays nostalgic tribute to disreputable traditions of moviemaking and moviegoing. Robert Rodriguez contributes ''Planet Terror,'' a purposely incoherent zombie gross-out flick that flaunts is own badness the way Rose McGowan (as a go-go dancer named Cherry Darling) shows off her weaponized prosthetic leg. For his part, Quentin Tarantino, more of a connoisseur than his collaborator (and a much better filmmaker), turns out a brutal, talky and satisfying car-chase revenge movie in ''Death Proof,'' starring Kurt Russell. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'HOLLYWOOD DREAMS' (R, 100 minutes) Filled with movie memories and gender confusion, Henry Jaglom's 15th and most accessible film finds him in a gentler, more wistful mood. Using a rabidly fame-smitten starlet (Tanna Frederick) as his fulcrum, Mr. Jaglom muses over the burdens of fame and the price of success. Knowing but never jaded, the movie is driven by Ms. Frederick's no-boundaries commitment to her broken character, a performance that's as startling as it is touching. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'HOT FUZZ' (R, 121 minutes) A British parody of Hollywood-style action flicks from the wits behind ''Shaun of the Dead.'' Think of it as ''The Full Monty'' blown to smithereens. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'THE INVISIBLE' (PG-13, 102 minutes) This supremely silly retread of the 2002 Swedish film ''Den Osynlige'' proves it's tough to be in love and in limbo at one and the same time. When a rich-yet-troubled teenager (Justin Chatwin) crosses paths with a violently disturbed classmate (Margarita Levieva), we learn that there's nothing quite like a near-death experience to repair those stubborn emotional wounds. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'KILLER OF SHEEP' (No rating, 83 minutes) Largely hidden from view for three decades, Charles Burnett's lyrical film about a working-class family living in a broken-down home in a bombed-out stretch of Los Angeles is an American masterpiece. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'NEXT' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Nicolas Cage plays a guy who can see into the future in this crummy adaptation of a nifty Philip K. Dick story. Too bad Mr. Cage couldn't tap into those same powers to save himself from another bad role. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'9 STAR HOTEL' (No rating, 78 minutes, in Arabic and Hebrew) Ido Haar's fascinating documentary follows a group of illegal Palestinian construction workers as they scrabble to survive in and around the Israeli city of Modiin. With an open mind and a handheld camera, this Israeli filmmaker strives to make the political personal; but by excluding Israeli voices, Mr. Haar has produced a work filled with immediacy but free of analysis. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'ONCE' (R, 88 minutes) A modest, scruffy movie about two musicians who meet on a Dublin street and sort of fall in love. Charming, touching and true. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'PAPRIKA' (R, 90 minutes, in Japanese) In this gorgeous riot of future-shock ideas and brightly animated imagery, the doors of perception never close. Satoshi Kon's mind-twisting, eye-tickling anim√© isn't greasy kid's stuff: it's for thinking, interested adults whose sense of wonder remains as alive as their imaginations. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'PARIS JE T'AIME' (R, 120 minutes, in French and English) ''Paris Je T'Aime,'' a mosaic of 18 miniatures, each set in a different location in the City of Light, is a cinematic tasting menu consisting entirely of amuse-bouches. After two hours of such tidbits, the palate is sated. But if there is no need for a main course, you still leave feeling vaguely disappointed at not being served one. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT WORLD'S END' (PG-13, 167 minutes) This third and perhaps final episode in Gore Verbinski's swishy, swashbuckling saga wisely returns to the high-seas high jinks that made the first film so enjoyable. In service to a typically convoluted plot -- involving British perfidy, pieces of eight and a Godzilla-size sorceress -- all the usual suspects return to lie, swindle and marvel at Keith Richards's longevity, if not his line delivery. Jack Sparrow hallucinates, Barbossa agitates, and Elizabeth Swann is elected Pirate King. Really. Mr. Verbinski knows who wears the trousers in his trilogy. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'SEVERANCE' (R, 90 minutes) A weapons company retreat in a Hungarian forest turns into a bloody game of whack-a-mole in this sophomore horror film from the British director Christopher Smith. The political argument may be broad -- there is some satisfaction in seeing the gung-ho team leader hoisted by his own explosive petard -- but the visual technique is sharp, creating a lively romp through terrain less traveled than you might think. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'SHREK THE THIRD' (PG, 93 minutes) The ogre faces impending fatherhood and a career crisis. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'SHOWBUSINESS' (PG, 102 minutes) This documentary by Dori Bernstein follows four Broadway musicals from rehearsal through the 2004 Tony Awards: ''Caroline, or Change''; ''Taboo''; ''Avenue Q''; and ''Wicked.'' On top of the usual challenges (fund-raising, rewrites, tryouts, marketing), they all had to endure scrutiny by theater critics and gossip columnists. Lively, sometimes cutting but mostly humane, ''ShowBusiness'' is packed with telling details. (Matt Zoller Seitz)</p>
        <p>'SPIDER-MAN 3' (PG-13, 139 minutes) Please, God, make this be the last one. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'TA RA RUM PUM' (No rating, 156 minutes, in English and Hindi) This movie about a race car driver (the versatile Saif Ali Khan) takes place in New York, but that doesn't stop it from being a classic example of Bollywood family values. Here, all the city's a stage set, perfect for ''Fame''-meets-''West Side Story'' production numbers. (Saltz)</p>
        <p>* 28 WEEKS LATER' (R, 91 minutes) The virus that killed off most of England -- after turning its population into rabid, flesh-hungry zombies -- seems to be under control at the start of this terrifying sequel to ''28 Days Later.'' But if anything, the horror is deeper, and the social criticism more acute. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'VACANCY' (R, 80 minutes) This banal horror retread involves a couple of critters (Luke Wilson, Kate Beckinsale) flailing inside a sticky trap for what is, in effect, the big-screen equivalent of a roach motel. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'THE VALET' (PG-13, 85 minutes, in French) If you love to hate the superrich, this delectable comedy, in which the great French actor Daniel Auteuil portrays a piggy billionaire industrialist facing his comeuppance, is a sinfully delicious bonbon, a classic French farce with modern touches. (Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'WAITRESS' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Keri Russell is a small-town waitress in a bad marriage who finds solace in pie-baking and adultery in Adrienne Shelly's wry and winning final feature. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'YEAR OF THE DOG' (PG-13, 97 minutes) Mike White's touching comedy about a woman who loses a dog and finds herself is funny ha-ha but firmly in touch with its downer side, which means that it's also funny in a kind of existential way. Molly Shannon stars alongside a menagerie of howling scene-stealers. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'ZOO' (No rating, 76 minutes) Robinson Devor's heavily reconstructed documentary is, to a large extent, about the rhetorical uses of beauty. It is, rather more coyly, also about a man who died after having sex with a stallion. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>Film Series and Revivals</p>
        <p>SAM FULLER (Tomorrow and Sunday) The Museum of the Moving Image continues its survey of the work of the tabloid-trained film director Samuel Fuller. The highlights in this session are 35-millimeter prints of Fuller's two films for Allied Artists, from the U.C.L.A. Film and Television Archive: the astounding ''Shock Corridor,'' in which a madhouse becomes a metaphor for American society about 1963, and ''The Naked Kiss'' (1964), the only film I can think of offhand that begins with a bald prostitute (Constance Towers) beating her pimp to death with a telephone handset. Museum of the Moving Image, 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us; $10. (Dave Kehr)</p>
        <p>'MALA NOCHE' (Tonight through Thursday) Gus Van Sant's first feature, shot in Portland in 1985, announces many of the themes of his later work but operates with a ragged spontaneity that has largely vanished from his highly formalist recent features. Tim Streeter stars as Walt, a convenience-store clerk who conceives a one-sided love for a Mexican teenager (Doug Cooeyate). The film, shot in black-and-white 16-millimeter, has now been digitally restored and features a new soundtrack remastered by Mr. Van Sant. IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771, ifccenter.com; $10.75. (Kehr)</p>
        <p>SUNDANCE INSTITUTE AT BAM (Tonight through Thursday) For a second year, the organizers of the Sundance Film Festival are taking a selection of films, theater and music created or presented under their aegis to the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The film component includes seven features from this year's Sundance festival that have not yet found theatrical distribution (including ''Padre Nuestro,'' the winner of this year's Grand Jury Prize for dramatic film), so this may be the one chance New Yorkers will have to see them on a screen. This weekend's screenings include: ''Rocket Science,'' the fiction debut of Jeffrey Blitz, who directed the documentary ''Spellbound''; ''War/Dance,'' a documentary by Sean Fine and Andrea Nix Fine about three children growing up in the combat zone of northern Uganda; ''Snow Angels,'' a drama by David Gordon Green (''George Washington'') starring Sam Rockwell as an alcoholic Southerner in the painful process of separating from his wife (Kate Beckinsale); ''Delirious,'' Tom DiCillo's comic portrait of a desperate paparazzi (Steve Buscemi); and ''Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten,'' a documentary about the drummer of The Clash, directed by the music video pioneer Julien Temple. Sunday is devoted to four programs that together contain 27 short films. The series continues through June 10. BAMcin√©matek, BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $11. (Kehr)</p>
        <p>Pop  Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.</p>
        <p>KEREN ANN (Monday) With exquisitely delicate, sensuous songs that seem never to touch the ground, Keren Ann Zeidel -- born in Tel Aviv and raised in Paris -- is the model of the modern cosmopolitan chanteuse, part jazzy, part indie-cabaret and part glam-folk. With Jason Hart. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15. (Ben Sisario)</p>
        <p>ALAN BERGMAN (Tuesday) With a new album, ''Lyrically, Alan Bergman'' (Verve), this three-time Oscar-winning songwriter (''The Windmills of Your Mind,'' ''The Way We Were'') makes a rare appearance at Joe's Pub. At 9:30 p.m., 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $25. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>BRAZZAVILLE (Tonight) While playing saxophone for Beck in the '90s, David Brown learned guitar and started Brazzaville, writing languid, bittersweet songs in a multicultural update of the vagabond cabaret of Tom Waits and Tindersticks. Four years ago he relocated to Barcelona and formed a new version of the band, still singing about crumbling cafes and the way his former lovers held their cigarettes. The new Brazzaville makes its American debut tonight at 9:30 at Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $15. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* BRIGHT EYES (Tonight) In the indie-rock equivalent of Bruce Springsteen's filling up Giants Stadium for weeks on end, Bright Eyes -- consisting of the excessively confessional man-child Conor Oberst (dressed in Prada these days) and whomever he's playing with -- has sold out seven shows at Town Hall, ending tonight. His guest is Gillian Welch, who plays a mellow bluegrass-folk hybrid with grace. At 7:30, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, the-townhall-nyc.org. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>CALIFONE (Thursday) A mainstay of the Chicago experimental-rock scene, Califone plays wistful songs with a constant thin hum. With the Bitter Tears and Curtis Harvey. At 8 p.m., Blender Theater at Gramercy, 127 East 23rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; $15. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* JUDY COLLINS (Tuesday through Thursday) What Ms. Collins brings to a song, whether she wrote it or not, is perspective. You have the sense of a woman standing alone in the night air, gazing at a star and directing a beam of psychic energy into the cosmos. Or maybe she is the receiver of this cool, steady light; it cuts both ways. She is back at the Caf√© Carlyle for a series of encore performances. At 8:45 p.m., Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $150 cover at tables, $100 at the bar. (Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>CSS (Tonight) Over bare, exuberant and deliberately amateurish art-funk, this mostly female Brazilian group celebrates the sacrament of casual sex through come-ons shouted and mumbled in robotic, broken English. (''Kiss-kiss-kiss will make this earth quake.'') With Yo Majesty. At 9, Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $20. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* DATAROCK (Tomorrow) It might seem impossible at this point to find something new on the well-traveled path of electro dance-rock. But somehow this Norwegian duo does it, with spiky disco, a full supply of funk guitar riffs and a rock 'n' roll attitude that mixes snarls with catchy, silly ''Fa-fa-fa fa-fa-fa-fa-fa'' choruses. With Low Bee and Passions. At 10 p.m., Studio B, 259 Banker Street, between Meserole Avenue and Calyer Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 389-1880, clubstudiob.com; $10. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>DEAN AND BRITTA (Tomorrow) In Luna, Dean Wareham expertly channeled the cool, slow-shifting guitar clouds of the mid-period Velvet Underground. Since dissolving Luna two years ago, he has been playing with its former bassist, Britta Phillips, and on their new album, ''Back Numbers'' (Zoe/Rounder), they emulate, with unfortunate stiffness, another touchstone of 1960s cool: the bare, dissolute country of Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra. With My Robot Friend. At 9:30 p.m., Luna Lounge, 361 Metropolitan Avenue, at Havemeyer Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (212) 307-7171, lunalounge.com; $18. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* DINOSAUR JR., AWESOME COLOR (Wednesday and Thursday) One of the greatest and most influential original grunge bands, Dinosaur Jr. joined mopey lyrics to furious guitar sludge, prefiguring Nirvana. Long estranged, the original lineup of J Mascis on guitar, Lou Barlow on bass and Murph on drums reunited two years ago and just released ''Beyond'' (Fat Possum), their first album together in 18 years, sounding as brawny and vigorous as ever. Awesome Color's gruff, retro garage-blues is self-consciously noisy as only New York rock can be, but it is also indebted -- and seems partly a homage -- to the vintage Detroit proto-punk of the Stooges and the MC5. At 9 p.m., Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $25. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>JOHN DOE (Wednesday and Thursday) In the seminal Los Angeles punk band X and on his own, John Doe has linked a rugged sentimentality to twangy, rockabilly-tinged songs, and is particularly good at singing with women. His latest, ''A Year in the Wilderness'' (Yep Roc), features Aimee Mann, Jill Sobule and Kathleen Edwards aside longtime collaborators like the guitarist Dave Alvin. Wednesday at 9 p.m., BAMCaf√©, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; no cover. Thursday at 8 p.m., Living Room, 154 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235, livingroomny.com; $10. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* ROKY ERICKSON AND ALEJANDRO ESCOVEDO (Tomorrow) One of the godfathers of psychedelic rock, who howled like a werewolf over the flutter of an electric jug in his 1960s band the 13th Floor Elevators, Roky Erickson is also one of the most notorious casualties of that era. Now, at 59 and in his best health in years, he is back on the road with a tough, no-nonsense band, and at his belated New York debut seven weeks ago tore through classics like ''You're Gonna Miss Me'' with ease and lots of low-end guitar fuzz. Alejandro Escovedo's songs stare down loss and mortality with a mixture of unflinching memory and a rocker's defiance. At 7 p.m., Castle Clinton National Monument, Battery Park, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789, rivertorivernyc.com. Free; tickets available at 5 p.m., two per person. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>FAIRPORT CONVENTION (Sunday) One original member and two later recruits of this groundbreaking British progressive-folk group from the 1960s and '70s -- the guitarist Simon Nicol, who was in it from the beginning, along with the violinist and mandolin player Chris Leslie and the violinist Ric Sanders -- play an acoustic set of Fairport Convention songs, jazz and swing standards and traditional folk. At 7 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $25. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>MARIANNE FAITHFULL (Wednesday) Marianne Faithfull applies her husky ruin of a voice to songs about harrowing moments and bitter realizations. In songs she wrote herself or chose with exacting standards, she reveals every scar with bleak fascination and no regrets. At 8 p.m., Kaye Playhouse, 68th Street between Park and Lexington Avenues, (212) 307-7171; $75. (Jon Pareles)</p>
        <p>FALL OUT BOY, +44, THE ACADEMY IS , PAUL WALL, COBRA STARSHIP (Tuesday and Wednesday) They could have called it Monsters of Emo, but certain considerations led to a name that is less rock 'n' roll but perhaps just as indicative of mainstream success: the Honda Civic Tour. Fall Out Boy remains the model second-wave (or is this the third?) emo band: snarky and jumpy, interested in relationships over solitude, and bursting with melodic pop-punk riffs. Also on the bill are +44, with Mark Hoppus and Travis Barker of Blink-182; the Houston rapper Paul Wall; and Cobra Starship, adrift in a sea of dance-punk irony. Tuesday at 6 p.m., Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000, nikonjonesbeach.com; $25 and $40. Wednesday at 6 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Holmdel, N.J., (732) 335-8698, artscenter.com; $23.75 and $39.50. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>NELLY FURTADO (Thursday) Last year Ms. Furtado and Justin Timberlake demonstrated a truism of 21st-century pop: work with Timbaland and ye shall receive bucketfuls of hits and be reborn as a star. Opening the show are Kenna and Saukrates. At 8 p.m., WaMu Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741 or (212) 307-4111, thegarden.com; $45 to $65. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>THE HORRORS (Monday) Recalling the early Damned, this British band sticks to dark, cold and gloomy in its albums but comes alive -- or is that fully undead? -- onstage. With Schoolyard Heroes and Night Kills The Day. At 8:30 p.m., Luna Lounge, 361 Metropolitan Avenue, at Havemeyer Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (212) 307-7171, lunalounge.com; $14. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* HOT 97 SUMMER JAM (Sunday) This annual mega-concert presented by the radio station Hot 97 (WQHT-FM) is always one of the most talked-about hip-hop events in the country, as much because of the starry lineup as because of the sparks that sometimes fly between its members. This year the stage is particularly overstocked, with Ludacris, Akon, Chris Brown with Lil Wayne and Birdman, Diddy with Keyshia Cole and Elephant Man, Ne-Yo, Ciara, Young Jeezy, Mims, Swizz Beatz, Rich Boy and T-Pain. At 6:30 p.m., Giants Stadium, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900, meadowlands.com; $40 to $165. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>CALVIN JOHNSON, JULIE DOIRON (Tonight) Mr. Johnson, the granddaddy of the Northwest punk scene, is a dedicated pop primitivist whose odes to the uncorrupted child-savage within are delivered in a froggy and purposely tuneless bass that sounds anything but childlike. Ms. Doiron, formerly of the band Eric's Trip, is too talented a songwriter for gimmickry, singing with quiet intensity about the agony of kissing ''the wrong guy.''

Sunday at 5 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday at 8 p.m. (prelude concerts at 6:45), (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $32 to $79. (Schweitzer)</p>
        <p>BRUCE LEVINGSTON (Tuesday) As part of its ''Surreal Delicacy of Ren√© Clair'' series, the French Institute/Alliance Fran√ßaise is offering a recital devoted to the music of Erik Satie, including his score for Clair's film ''Entr'acte,'' which will be performed with a screening of it. The pianist Bruce Levingston will also perform Satie's ''Sports et Divertissements,'' with Nick McDonnell narrating.

At 8 p.m., Mannes College the New School for Music, 150 West 85th Street, Manhattan, (212) 580-0210, newschool.edu/mannes/summer; $20. (Bernard Holland)</p>
        <p>DILIANA MOMTCHILOVA AND VASSILY PRIMAKOV (Sunday) Ms. Momtchilova, a Bulgarian cellist who won first prize at the Washington International Competition, joins forces with the superb Russian pianist Vassily Primakov for a recital of Bach, Faur√©, Debussy, Schubert and Popper at Arium, a comfortable hybrid of a restaurant and a concert hall. Arium's concerts are relatively genteel experiences: before and after the performance, listeners are served wine or Champagne, hors d'oeuvres and dessert. At 5 p.m., Arium, 31 Little West 12th Street, West Village, (212) 463-8630, ariumnyc.com; $40; $20 for members. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>NEW AMSTERDAM SINGERS (Thursday) Music, birds, saints and true love: Hallmark sentiment to some, poetry in the hands of Yeats and Auden, and the themes of this program by the noted amateur chorus led by Clara Longstreth and accompanied here by everything from marimba to harpsichord. The evening includes four New York premieres by David Brunner, Paul Crabtree, Howard Skempton and Richard Wilson. At 8 p.m., Church of the Holy Trinity, 316 East 88th Street, Manhattan, (212) 842-1511, nasingers.org; $20. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Today, tomorrow, Tuesday and Thursday) The Philharmonic's Brahms series, conducted by Lorin Maazel, ambles on in this morning's performance of the Third and Fourth Symphonies and then heats up for the next week. A new Brahms program tomorrow evening, repeated on Tuesday, offers the ''Haydn'' Variations and the ''German'' Requiem, with the soprano Celena Shafer and the baritone Matthias Goerne. A whole new program on Thursday brings the conductor Riccardo Muti, and Lang Lang as soloist, in the Beethoven ''Emperor'' Concerto.

        <p>* LUCY SHELTON (Tuesday) The Movado Hour is a series of one-hour chamber music concerts presented by the enterprising Baryshnikov Arts Center in a wonderfully informal salon setting. Tuesday's enticing program offers the soprano (and contemporary-music champion) Lucy Shelton; the pianist Pedja Muzijevic, who is also the center's director of music programs; and the dynamic Brentano String Quartet in a program of works by George Crumb (''Apparitions'') and Brahms (the Piano Quintet in F minor). At 7 p.m., 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (917) 934-4966, baryshinikovdancefoundation.org; free, but reservations are required. (Tommasini)</p>

        <p>* AMERICAN BALLET THEATER (Tonight, tomorrow and Monday through Thursday) It's here at last: the controversial new production of ''The Sleeping Beauty,'' created by Gelsey Kirkland, Kevin McKenzie and Michael Chernov. If even half the rumors pan out, this re-envisioning of a classic should be revelatory, and a trip. The leads -- the Princess Aurora, her prince, the Lilac Fairy and the evil Carabosse -- will be danced by Veronika Part, Marcelo Gomes, Gillian Murphy and Martine van Hamel (tonight); Paloma Herrera, √Ångel Corella, Michele Wiles and Carmen Corella (tomorrow's matinee and Thursday); Julie Kent, Ethan Stiefel, Stella Abrera and Ms. van Hamel (tomorrow night and Tuesday); Ms. Part, Mr. Gomes, Ms. Murphy and Ms. Kirkland (Monday); Irina Dvorovenko, Maxim Beloserkovsky, Ms. Wiles and Ms. Kirkland (Wednesday matinee), and Diana Vishneva, David Hallberg, Ms. Abrera and Ms. van Hamel (Wednesday night). Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, abt.org; $24 to $110. (Jennifer Dunning)</p>
        <p>RENEE ARCHIBALD (Tonight and tomorrow night) Ms. Archibald's ''Oh Dear Natascha'' explores darkness and confinement in an environment filled with small piles of samples and clippings quietly waiting, as Ms. Archibald puts it, ''for an imaginary domestic life in various imaginary cities.'' Well, why not? At 8, the Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (212) 352-3101, chocolatefactorytheater.org; $15. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>LORI BELILOVE (Wednesday and Thursday) Ms. Belilove, who specializes in the dances of Isadora Duncan, will present her own choreography in a program titled ''The EveryWoman Series: The Red Thread.'' The dances are set to music by Chopin, performed live. (Through June 8.)

        <p>* BOOGIE DOWN DANCE SERIES AT BAAD! (Tonight, tomorrow, Tuesday and Wednesday) In its last week the festival will present dance by the Arthur Aviles Typical Theater troupe (tonight and tomorrow night); ''Dancing on Broken Glass,'' a panel discussion on the growth and state of professional dance in the Bronx (Tuesday); and an evening of Bronx-based dance by artists chosen by Christal Brown and Movement Research (Wednesday).

On Thursday night ''Underexposed'' will feature work by Elise Knudson, Irem Calikusu, Dorian Nuskind-Oder, Beth Bradford and Casey Blake, all chosen by Monica Bill Barnes and Shannon Hummel.

(Dunning)</p>
        <p>DANCE AT DNA (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) In Ben Munisteri's new ''Terra Nova,'' dancers leave a design of moving colors and patterns in their wake, courtesy of motion-capture technology. (Through Sunday.) The Stefanie Nelson Dance Group follows on Thursday in Ms. Nelson's new mixed-media ''Out of Wonderland,'' a collaboration with the video artist Nell Breyer and the composer Andrea Ferrara. (Through June 9.) Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 3 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, TriBeCa, (212) 279-4200, dnadance.org; $25 tonight through Sunday; $17 on Thursday. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>DANIEL GWIRTZMAN DANCE COMPANY (Thursday) Apparently Mr. Gwirtzman was once known as ''Disco Danny,'' which suggests that his new evening-length ''Encore,'' set to jazz and popular music, may indeed offer the ''accessibility and entertainment value'' that its publicity promises. Perhaps there will even be a disco ball. (Through June 9.) At 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 334-7479; $25; $15 for students. (Roslyn Sulcas)</p>
        <p>KOOSIL-JA'S MECH[A] OUTPUT (Tonight and tomorrow night) Koosil-Ja Hwang blends elements of dance and music from the classic Japanese Noh play ''Dojoji'' with what she describes as multimedia technology, including live 3-D video. At 7:30, Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 715-1258, japansociety.org; $25. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>* DIANNE McINTYRE AND OLU DARA (Sunday) Ms. McIntyre and Mr. Dara are two of a kind. Or one, perhaps, given the seamlessness of their funny, imaginative and profoundly poignant dance-theater duos. Their program, ''Pieces of Pieces,'' offers a rare chance to see them perform together. At 7 p.m., Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, Malcolm X Boulevard, at 135th Street, Harlem, (212) 491-2206; $12. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>* MOMIX (Tonight through Thursday) A company that revels in acrobatic movement and theatrical illusion reviews a quarter-century in ''Momix reMIX.'' (Through June 10.) Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $44. (Jack Anderson)</p>
        <p>* NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) The week's programming includes ''Three by Bach'' (''Concerto Barocco,'' ''Tribute'' and ''Brandenburg''), tonight and on Wednesday; ''Three Masters: Tchaikovsky, Balanchine, Robbins'' (''Mozartiana,'' ''Piano Pieces'' and ''Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 2''), tomorrow afternoon; ''Essential Robbins'' (''In G Major,'' ''Dances at a Gathering,'' ''I'm Old Fashioned''), tomorrow night; ''International Balanchine'' (''Serenade,'' ''Bugaku'' and ''Union Jack''), on Sunday and Tuesday; and a one-time lineup of ''Serenade,'' Peter Martins's ''Gentilhommes'' (danced by students from the School of American Ballet) and Balanchine's ''Union Jack,'' on Thursday.

(Dunning)</p>
        <p>JENNY ROCHA DANCE THEATER/JASON DIETZ MARCHANT AND LINDSEY DIETZ MARCHANT (Tonight through Sunday night) The emotional and physical interaction between couples seems to be the theme of this double bill at Danspace: Ms. Rocha performs with her longtime dance partner Christine Poland in ''just barely,'' and Mr. and Ms. Dietz Marchant present ''Inflatable Man, Evaporating Woman.'' At 8:30, Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194; $15; members $10. (Sulcas)</p>
        <p>* SCHOOL OF AMERICAN BALLET 2007 WORKSHOP PERFORMANCES (Tomorrow and Monday) Always a mix of radiant idealism and shrewd competitiveness, this event promises extra luster this year as it pays tribute to Lincoln Kirstein, who founded the school and the New York City Ballet with George Balanchine. The young dancers will perform Balanchine's rarely seen but lovely ''Gounod Symphony,'' his ''Four Temperaments,'' Peter Martins's ''Gentilhommes'' and a new work by Sean Lavery, set to Mozart, called ''Twinkliana.'' Tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Monday at 7 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 155 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-6600, sab.org; $40 tomorrow, $70 on Monday. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>* SITELINES 2007: MARTHA GRAHAM DANCE COMPANY (Today through Sunday) This site-specific festival opens tonight with an outdoor performance by the Graham company of ''Steps in the Streets'' and ''Prelude to Action.'' At 12:30 p.m. (Festival continues through Sept. 14.) Wall and Broad Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 219-9401, lmcc.net/sitelines. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>STREB S.L.A.M. 9 (Tonight through Sunday) High-flying, wall-crashing thrills and chills, and popcorn besides. (Through June 17.)

        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>* BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'GLOBAL FEMINISMS,' through July 1. Too much of the work in this assembly of pieces by nearly 90 women from nearly 50 countries is body-oriented and doesn't venture beyond the essentialism of Judy Chicago's indomitable 1975-79 installation opus, ''The Dinner Party,'' whose enshrinement in the new Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art this exhibition celebrates. Thoroughly dominated by photography and video, with a documentary slant to many of its better moments, the show is more about information, politics and the struggle for equality than it is about art in any very concentrated or satisfying sense. That doesn't keep parts of it from being energetic and illuminating. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)</p>
        <p>BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through July 29. This show of about 60 works by Durand has as its centerpiece ''Kindred Spirits'' (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet and journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape. He explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage and rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck)</p>
        <p>GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DIVISIONISM/NEO-IMPRESSIONISM: ARCADIA AND ANARCHY,' through Aug. 6. Ultimately this rare, compressed, mercurial exhibition of work by the Italian Divisionists of the 1890s is long on history and short on truly convincing paintings. The inclusion of works by Seurat and his French, Dutch and Belgian followers clarifies how the Italians pushed Pointillism, Seurat's invention, in all directions: toward realism, academic classicism, Symbolism, class consciousness and even Impressionism. The show opens a new, albeit small, window on the genesis of Modernism beyond the French canon. If many of the works are period pieces, they are also immensely appealing, big-hearted and physically robust period pieces. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'BIOGRAPHICAL LANDSCAPE: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF STEPHEN SHORE, 1969-1979,' through Sept. 9. In 1971 the Metropolitan Museum of Art gave Stephen Shore its second-ever exhibition by a living photographer. (Alfred Stieglitz had the first.) He was 23 when it opened. What he did makes up most of this wonderful show. Mr. Shore has reprinted the photographs digitally, with rejuvenated colors as fresh and subtle as the day the pictures were shot. The work's laconic eloquence speaks of an era and a nation. Its wit and affection add buoyancy to scenes of threadbare America from a moment when the country was depressed by war and years of civil unrest. Its formal rigor makes an uncanny order out of images that, at first glance, look like no place or nothing. Look again. His show reminds us of a period when cutting-edge American art and the tradition of straight, documentary photography got together. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at West 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Michael Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>* INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'LET YOUR MOTTO BE RESISTANCE: AFRICAN AMERICAN PORTRAITS,' through Sept. 9. This show of photographic portraits is a praise-song in pictures, a shout-out to history. It's also a fancy-dress inaugural party for the yet-to-be-built National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. It tends to be a little too fancy, too heavy on glitz, too short on grit. Still, what a party it is, with a Who's Who of charismatic black statesmen, from Frederick Douglass to Malcolm X, and with Leontyne Price, Mahalia Jackson and the Supremes sharing a stage. (See above.) (Holland Cotter)</p>
        <p>THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'IMPRESSIONIST AND EARLY MODERN PAINTINGS:THE CLARK BROTHERS COLLECT,' through Aug. 19. The Met examines the lives and collecting habits of two feuding brothers, heirs to the Singer sewing machine fortune, who were among the leading 20th-century art patrons. Sterling Clark was founder of the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass. His younger brother Stephen was a trustee of both the Met and the Museum of Modern Art (and established the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.) The brothers shared a love of Renoir, Degas and Americans like Winslow Homer, but Sterling ''drew the line'' at C√©zanne and considered Matisse and Picasso ''bad painters and fakers.'' Tracking their taste and how they dispersed their collections is interesting -- and perhaps instructive for contemporary collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)</p>
        <p>* THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'POIRET: KING OF FASHION,' through Aug. 5. A revolutionary in revolutionary times, the fashion designer Paul Poiret introduced unstructured garments that freed women from corsets in 1906, the year before Picasso committed his decidedly uninhibited (and unstaid) ''Demoiselles d'Avignon'' to canvas. But the modern painter whom Poiret most resembles, in his love of the exotic, his brilliant use of color and pattern and his penchant for simplified, almost rudimentary form, is Matisse. This rare exhibition -- from the Met's Costume Institute -- does his sartorial genius justice with a spare installation rendered radiant by hand-painted silk backdrops of the leafy parks and luxurious drawing rooms of Paris. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)</p>
        <p>THE MET: 'FRANK STELLA: PAINTING INTO ARCHITECTURE,' through July 29. Crammed into a gallery that feels like an obstacle course, this exhibition spans 43 years with 25 paintings, reliefs, drawings and architectural models, all with the goal of tracing an evolution that has not yet occurred. Taking up most of the space are enlarged versions of models that are considered sculptures -- and that look as if they date from the early 1960s. The main draws are the examples of the paintings and reliefs that are the basis of Mr. Stella's importance as an artist. (See above.) (Smith)</p>
        <p>THE MET: 'FRANK STELLA ON THE ROOF,' through Oct. 28. Two large Pop Art sculptures, two architectural models and a model enlarged into a sculpture-installation piece confirm that one of the greatest American artists of the postwar era doesn't do himself or anyone else any favors when he strays from the wall to work fully in the round. The results have a certain Stella-like verve but are otherwise generic. (See above.) (Smith)</p>
        <p>MORGAN LIBRARY &amp; MUSEUM: 'APOCALYPSE THEN: MEDIEVAL ILLUMINATIONS FROM THE MORGAN,' through June 17. The symbolism of the Book of Revelation, with its demons and lakes of fire, has a subversive appeal. This exhibition at the Morgan Library celebrates a facsimile of ''Las Huelgas Apocalypse'' (1220), the largest surviving Spanish illuminated commentary on the Apocalypse. The show, which includes 50 leaves from the original text, unbound and installed around the gallery's perimeter, offers a walking tour of the medieval imagination. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Andrea K. Scott)</p>
        <p>* EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'THE DISAPPEARED (LOS DESAPARECIDOS),' through June 17. The most potent show of contemporary political art of the season, and one of the most moving shows of any kind in the city right now. The title refers to a peculiarly chilling form of violence associated with political upheavals in Latin America over the past 40 years, and now becoming more common in Iraq. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo .org. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'COMIC ABSTRACTION: IMAGE-BREAKING, IMAGE-MAKING,' through June 11. This unimaginative and uniformed treatment of a big idea -- the healthy and essential contamination of Modernist abstraction by popular culture -- should be seen if only because it is such a dispiriting symptom of the Modern's paralysis where contemporary art is concerned. Including 30 works by 13 artists from the last 16 years, it alternates between the literal and the arbitrary and favors sincere political intent over genuine artistic quality. Although it promises work that addresses ''perplexing questions,'' nearly everything here is perfectly pleasant and innocuous. The exceptions are provided by Gary Simmons, Ellen Gallagher and Sue Williams. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)</p>
        <p>STOREFRONT FOR ART AND ARCHITECTURE: 'CCCP: COSMIC COMMUNIST CONSTRUCTIONS PHOTOGRAPHED,' through June 16. This show, packed with obscure architectural gems, reopens on Tuesday. Covering a period ignored by academics and mainstream architects, it relies almost exclusively on the photographs of Fr√©d√©ric Chaubin, who spent five years traveling across the former Soviet Union, uncovering forgotten architectural works in cities like Tbilisi, Yalta and Yerevan. The results are a revelation. Among the outright gems is Georgy Chakhava's 1975 Roads Ministry building, a monumental grid of interlocking concrete forms rising on a steep, wooded site in Tbilisi, Georgia. Set on an incline between two highways, the building's heavy, cantilevered forms reflect the Soviet-era penchant for heroic scale. Yet they also relate sensitively to their context, celebrating the natural landscape that flows directly underneath the building. What's refreshing about this exhibition is its lack of an ideological agenda: it is open to all sorts of possibilities. The Gaud√≠esque romanticism of a sanitarium in Druskininkai, Lithuania, for example, spins the aesthetic off in yet another direction. Compelling and easy to digest, this show piques our interest in ways that some larger institutions, ever more averse to risk, often fail to do. 97 Kenmare Street, Little Italy, (212) 431-5795, storefrontnews.org. (Nicolai Ouroussoff)</p>
        <p>WHITNEY MUSEUM AT ALTRIA: MATTHEW BRANNON, 'WHERE WERE WE,' through Aug. 26. Matthew Brannon brings together art, poetry and advertising in a series of letterpress prints that hark back to 1950s and 1960s textile designs by Astrid Sampe and Marimekko. Texts written by the artist and accompanying the images read like song lyrics crossed with Conceptual Art and Language Poetry (which emphasized experimentalism and reader interaction). Consumption and excess are frequent references, as well as how art, design and fashion feed these modern yet primordial urges and desires. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, whitney.org. (Schwendener)</p>
        <p>WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'LINCOLN KIRSTEIN,' through Aug. 27. In the middle of the last century Lincoln Kirstein particularly relished attacking the Museum of Modern Art. Pure abstraction was ridiculous, he thought. It had no standards. Against Mondrian and Pollock, he endorsed, among others, the artists in this show. They are the sculptors Elie Nadelman and Gaston Lachaise and the painters Paul Cadmus, who was Kirstein's brother-in-law, Walker Evans and Pavel Tchelitchew. With the exception of Evans, Kirstein's taste clearly hasn't won the day, but it's never bad to re-examine received opinions or to be reminded of a generous advocate. 945 Madison Avenue at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600. (Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>* WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'SUMMER OF LOVE: ART OF THE PSYCHEDELIC ERA,' through Sept. 16. Tear gas, pot and patchouli were the scents of the 1960s. You can almost detect the last two wafting through this two-floor display of rock posters, light shows, photographs and paintings. But the burn of tear gas, with the association of political emergency it brings, is missing in a show that remembers a lot, but forgets much more, about what was happening 40 years ago, when America was losing its mind to save, some would say, its soul. (See above.) (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Uptown</p>
        <p>YAYOI KUSAMA: FROM HERE TO INFINITY Spanning 50 years, this 24-piece overview is notable for its high quality and for unfamiliar works that sharpen the understanding of this artist's protean talent, among them several small, pungently colored folk-arty paintings that deploy her signature (and obsessive) webs, dots and scale patterns as effectively as her more abstract works do. Barbara Mathes Gallery, 22 East 80th Street, (212) 570-4190, through June 8. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>* FRANCESCO CLEMENTE: PORTRAITS The works in this show reveal Mr. Clemente's relatively recent endeavors as a suave society portraitist, working on commission in single, daylong sittings. His subjects, while horizontal, don't so much recline as float toward the picture plane, surveying us with enormous eyes. The images can border on illustration, but sometimes color, space and personality collude to enchanting effect. Mary Boone Gallery, 541 West 24th Street, (212) 752-2929, through June 30. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* VALSAN KOORMA KOLLERI This Indian artist turns found objects, castoff materials and local stone from Kerala, where he lives, into large but delicate abstract sculptures. Copper vessels become containers for air and space; metal clock springs are woven into a time-rusted open-work basket; the simplest forms are ornamented with embedded glass beads. Talwar Gallery, 108 East 16th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 673-3096, through June 16. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Other</p>
        <p>* MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: PREIS PAINTINGS Seven canvases from two series of paintings rarely exhibited in this country play on the double German meaning of preis (price and prize), some variation of which appears on each surface. They show this famous bad-boy sculptor conveying his usual sarcasm in surprisingly beautiful terms that couldn't get much flatter. Hard-edged and brushy techniques contrast the main tactics of formalist painting while converting the Modernist grid into designs redolent of drapery and checked tablecloths. A preponderance of hot pink argues for the pleasure principle. 1018 Art, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 537-0453, www.1018art.net, through July 27. (Smith)</p>
        <p>OLIVER TWIST Each month this new gallery will rent its space to hip out-of-town galleries, a plan that could unsettle the home-away balance of powers in New York. The inaugural show, while something of a mish-mash, presents works by 29 artists represented by the renters of the coming season. Enjoy the sixth-floor space's Chelsea-like light and view, and stay tuned. Rental, 120 East Broadway, at Allen Street, Lower East Side, (212) 608-6002, through June 16. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Public Art</p>
        <p>MAD. SQ. ART 2007: ROXY PAINE This installation is made up of two stainless-steel tree sculptures -- ''Conjoined'' and ''Defunct'' -- and a glacierlike boulder, ''Erratic,'' by Mr. Paine. The tree sculptures are made from thousands of pieces of metal pipe and rod elements that have been cut, welded and polished. They are real enough to resemble actual trees but not so real that they form a continuum with the surrounding foliage. What captures your immediate attention is ''Conjoined,'' a 40-foot-tall-by-45-foot-wide sculpture of two trees whose gleaming steel branches cantilever and then improbably connect in midair. It is impossible to tell where the branches of one tree begin, and the other's end. But the piece is also beautifully eccentric, a futuristic fantasy of streamlined vegetation manufactured in imitation of the real thing, only much more appealing and exciting.

        <p>* MEQUITTA AHUJA AND CHARLES RITCHIE Ms. Ahuja makes her New York solo debut with large paintings on paper of mythical beings,half woman, half animal, dressed in robes as brilliantly colored as the tropical fruit and flowers around them. Referring to the artist's African-American and East Indian background, the pictures turn marginality into a regal condition. The gallery also kicks off its new artist's book program with a display of sketch books by Mr. Ritchie, an artist based in Maryland. Each small book is filled with marvelous watercolors and all but indecipherable writing. Mr. Ritchie has been making such books for 30 years. They are extraordinary. BravinLee Programs, 526 West 26th Street, 2nd floor, (212) 462-4406, closes tomorrow. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>* FRANCESCO CLEMENTE: WORKS, 1971-1979 A selection of nearly 70 little-known early drawings and intriguing photo-works shows this young, restless proto-Neo-Expressionist overcoming the gravitational pull of Arte Povera and Conceptual Art, and broaching themes of the body, sexuality and the inner life that would blossom in his large paintings of the 1980s. Deitch Projects, 76 Grand Street, SoHo, (212) 343-7300; closes tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* JOANNA MALINOWSKA Joanna Malinowska traveled to windswept Baffin Island in the Canadian Arctic last year in the footsteps of the anthropologist Franz Boas, who studied the Inuit there a century ago. The subject of Ms. Malinowska's research turns out to be a Native American musician and Elvis impersonator named Jimmy Ekho, and the film they made together is funny and moving. For another video Ms. Malinowska set a solar-powered boom-box in the middle of the Arctic wasteland, where it will play Glenn Gould's 1981 version of Bach's ''Goldberg Variations'' for as long as the sun shines. Venetia Kapernekas Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, eighth floor, (212) 462-4150, closes tomorrow. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'GORDON MATTA-CLARK RETROSPECTIVE'  I have no doubt that Matta-Clark is now being turned into a hot commercial commodity, but at least at the Whitney you can see what he aspired to be. He came up with various wonderfully harebrained ideas. Literally, in one case: after letting his hair grow for a year, he cut it off as a kind of performance and phrenological gag. The preserved hair, dutifully tagged piece by piece, opens the show like a holy relic. At the center of the exhibition is ''Splitting.'' To a plain single-family suburban frame house in Englewood, N.J., he made a cut straight down the middle, bisecting the building, then severing the four corners of the roof. The retrospective consists of films, drawings, photographs and some of the architectural pieces he cut out of buildings. The drawings are casual and not too interesting, but the luxurious black-and-white photographs from Paris speak more to Matta-Clark's formal elegance. The big message was: Life as art, and art as life, a philosophy dependent on our being properly attuned and keen to the moment. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org, closes on Sunday. (Kimmelman)</p>

        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Ra√∫l Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'CURTAINS' This musical comedy about a musical-comedy murder -- featuring songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Rupert Holmes -- lies on the stage like a promisingly gaudy string of firecrackers, waiting in vain for a match. The good news is that David Hyde Pierce, playing a diffident Boston detective, steps into full-fledged Broadway stardom. Scott Ellis directs a talent-packed cast that includes Debra Monk and Karen Ziemba. (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DEUCE' Back on Broadway for the first time in 25 years, Angela Lansbury is so vitally and indelibly present that she even gives flesh to this flimsy comedy. Terrence McNally's play, about the reunion of two former doubles partners (Ms. Lansbury and Marian Seldes), is a jerry-built shrine to enduring star power. Directed by Michael Blakemore (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'FROST/NIXON' Frank Langella turns in a truly titanic performance as Richard M. Nixon in Peter Morgan's briskly entertaining, if all-too-tidy, play about the former president's annihilating television interviews with the British talk show host David Frost (the excellent Michael Sheen). Michael Grandage directs with the momentum of a ticking-bomb thriller and the zing of a boulevard comedy (1:40). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'INHERIT THE WIND' Doug Hughes's wooden revival of this worthy war horse, based on the Scopes ''monkey'' trial of 1925, never musters much more velocity than a drugstore fan. Be grateful that the cast includes Christopher Plummer, in savory form as a Will Rogers of jurisprudence. An oddly subdued Brian Dennehy plays his pompous adversary (2:00). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40).Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'LEGALLY BLONDE' This nonstop sugar rush of a musical about a powder puff who finds her inner power-broker, based on the 2001 film, approximates the experience of eating a jumbo bag of Gummi Bears in one sitting. Flossing between songs is recommended (2:20). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'LOVEMUSIK' As Lotte Lenya and Kurt Weill, Donna Murphy and Michael Cerveris turn in stunningly shaded performances in what is, alas, a sluggish, mixed-up bio-musical. Scored with an eclectic sampler of Weill's songs, ''LoveMusik'' strives to achieve chilly distance and cozy intimacy in the same breath. Harold Prince directs; Alfred Uhry wrote the conventionally sentimental book (2:40). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'LES MIS√âRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'A MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN' Kevin Spacey gives a bizarre, beat-the-clock performance, as lively as a frog on a hot plate, as James Tyrone in this off-kilter revival of Eugene O'Neill's last play. Mercifully, he does not block the view of Eve Best, who maps the contradictory levels of Tyrone's strapping love interest with clarity and intelligence (2:50). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'110 IN THE SHADE' Is it possible for a performance to be too good? Audra McDonald brings such breadth of skill and depth of feeling to Lonny Price's lukewarm revival of this musical about a love-starved spinster that she threatens to burst the seams of this small, homey musical. She's an overwhelming presence in an underwhelming show (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PIRATE QUEEN' How to river-dance your way to the bottom of the ocean, courtesy of the songwriters of ''Les Mis√©rables'' (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'RADIO GOLF' The final -- and in dramatic terms, the weakest -- of August Wilson's magnificent 10-play cycle about the African-American experience, ''Radio Golf'' has the crackle of a bustling comedy. But this tale of getting and spending in the 1990s, directed by Kenny Leon, throbs with a lament for a lost time, a lost culture, a lost language (2:30). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING' Joan Didion's arresting but ultimately frustrating adaptation of her best-selling memoir about being blindsided by grief, starring Vanessa Redgrave. The tension between style and emotional content that made the book such a stunner does not translate to the stage. The substance here is in the silences, when the focus shifts from words to Ms. Redgrave's wry, wounded face (1:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'ALL THE WRONG REASONS: A TRUE STORY OF NEO-NAZIS, DRUG SMUGGLING AND UNDYING LOVE' John Fugelsang's amiable solo show mixes memoir and stand-up comedy in a tale of family, faith and Roman Catholic guilt. Slight but engaging (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 460-5475. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'BE' A high-energy, low-content Israeli show that blends music, dance and sex appeal in the latest attempt to tap into the ''Stomp'' market (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'BILL W. AND DR. BOB' This insightful new play about the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous subtly makes the claim that the recovery movement was born as a series of accidents. Patrick Husted is excellent as Bob Smith, Bill Wilson's partner in combating addictions (2:15). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Ginia Bellafante)</p>
        <p>* 'BLACKBIRD'  David Harrower's stunning new drama looks back at a sexual relationship -- between a 40-year-old man and a 12-year-old girl -- that transforms, cripples and paralyzes. Jeff Daniels and Alison Pill, both extraordinary, peel their characters down to their barest souls. Joe Mantello is the masterly director (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE BRIG' Serious students of the stage will want to check out the Living Theater's first revival since 1963 of Kenneth H. Brown's docudrama about the soul-shredding grind of daily life in a Marine Corps prison, once again directed by the company co-founder Judith Malina. One of the most celebrated productions in the company's history, ''The Brig'' harks back to an era when theater was at the forefront of both political and artistic radicalism (2:00). Living Theater, 21 Clinton Street, Lower East Side. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'CIRKUS INFERNO' Happy lunacy (1:00). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)</p>
        <p>'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'GASLIGHT' The Irish Repertory Theater's revival of Patrick Hamilton's 1938 thriller about a husband intent on driving his wife mad strips away the claustrophobia and ably resists clich√©d feminist interpretation. As the impish detective who saves the day, Brian Murray is the play's great leavening agent. He prompts the heroine to whiskey drinking, and you want to raise a glass to him (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Bellafante)</p>
        <p>* 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE J.A.P. SHOW: JEWISH AMERICAN PRINCESSES of comedy' Laughs along with longueurs (1:30). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Van Gelder)</p>
        <p>'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Anita Gates)</p>
        <p>'MOTHER LOAD' In her one-woman show on the perils of affluent motherhood, Amy Wilson derides the culture of obsessive child-rearing as she chronicles her submission to it. An affable presence onstage, Ms. Wilson nevertheless mines overly clich√©d territory: the nut allergies, the horrors of preschool admission, the importance of knowing two languages by the time you are 3. Posters on Urbanbaby.com will find themselves amusedly looking in the mirror. All other New Yorkers will find themselves wanting to move to Patagonia (1:15). Sage Theater, 711 Seventh Avenue, at 47th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Bellafante)</p>
        <p>'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY'  Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30).Westside Theater Downstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)</p>
        <p>* 'PASSING STRANGE' The composer and performer Stew narrates this semiautobiographical show about a songwriter on a journey of self-discovery. Part rock concert, part book musical, it flows smoothly on a strong current of feeling and humor as the Los Angeles-born central character searches for his musical voice in the hash bars of Amsterdam and the cabarets of Berlin (2:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Off Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'T J AND DAVE' The comics T. J. Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance. This is an impressive feat of mental athletics, but the results are also observant, complex and frequently enormously funny (1:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)</p>
        <p>Long-Running Shows</p>
        <p>'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>

        <p>'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE'  A pasteboard pastiche of 1920's musicals, as remembered by a witty show queen(1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Often more entertaining than the real thing (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'JERSEY BOYS'  The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>

        <p>'BEAUTY ON THE VINE' Zak Berkman presents muddled politics and distorted anxieties in his quasi-science-fiction play about the influence of plastic surgery on young women who start modeling themselves after a right-wing radio host. Adding to the atmosphere of hysteria is the inability of the actors onstage to render a single subtle or nuanced moment (2:10). Harold Clurman Theater, 412 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Bellafante)</p>
        <p>'DAUGHTER OF A CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY' A standard-issue solo play about a fascinating Cuban family (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200; closes tomorrow. (Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'GOD'S EAR' Jenny Schwartz's formally inventive and brilliantly performed drama about how the death of a child affects a family is more interested in language than in narrative (1:20). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444; closes tomorrow. (Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'I LOVE YOU , YOU'RE PERFECT, NOW CHANGE!' This revue has proved as indestructible as the truisms about men and women on which it is based: it has run for 11 years Off Broadway and spread around the world. Now one of its avatars is coming for a visit: the Mandarin production with Lin Yilun, a major Chinese star, has arrived in New York for a limited run, playing concurrently with the English version. This is supposedly the first time a foreign production of an American musical has played in the United States (and the first Chinese-language production of a major American musical). It will be interesting to see how the piece's hoary stereotypes change in translation; Joel Bishoff, the original director, modified the work to reflect Chinese culture for its Shanghai run (2:00). The Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; Mandarin version closes on Sunday. (Anne Midgette)</p>
        <p>'NO CHILD'  Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'SILVERLAND' Global warming and the melting of the ice caps have destroyed London in this environmentally (if not dramatically) aware debut. Part of the Brits Off Broadway festival (2:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman)</p>

        <p>'AMU' (No rating, 102 minutes, in English, Bengali, Hindi and Punjabi) This ambitious first feature by Shonali Bose, about Kaju, a young Indian-American woman searching for the real India and for her roots, begins as a gentle comedy of cultures clashing. Its true topic, though, is the riots that broke out in Delhi in 1984 after Indira Gandhi's assassination. Thousands of Sikhs were killed, and as Kaju learns, justice has been delayed and denied. (Rachel Saltz)</p>
        <p>'ANGEL-A' (R, 90 minutes) Beneath its sophisticated Gallic gloss, this handsomely photographed feel-good fantasy, which shamelessly recycles ''It's a Wonderful Life'' and ''Heaven Can Wait,'' suggests an episode of ''Touched by an Angel'' without the tears. (Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'AWAY FROM HER' (PG-13, 110 minutes) Sarah Polley's well-observed adaptation of a story by Alice Munro is a quiet tour de force about love and loss, anchored by fine performances by Gordon Pinsent and Julie Christie as a couple dealing with the loss of memory and memories of past hurt. (A. O. Scott)</p>
        <p>'BLADES OF GLORY' (PG-13, 93 minutes) In this fast, light, frequently funny comedy about a male figure-skating team, Will Ferrell and Jon Heder stake an early claim to being the comedy couple of the year. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'THE BOSS OF IT ALL' (No rating, 99 minutes, in Danish) To describe ''The Boss of It All,'' Lars von Trier's acidic corporate comedy, as '' 'The Office' viewed through the looking glass'' only scratches the surface of the newest film from one of the foremost tricksters of world cinema. (Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'BRAND UPON THE BRAIN' (No rating, 96 minutes) A baroque entertainment with one foot in silent cinema and the other gingerly toeing the sound waves, Guy Maddin's latest centers on a man who, in visiting a now-emptied foundling home, journeys deep into his childhood. It's wild! It's weird! It's strangely touching and a total must-see! (Manohla Dargis)</p>
        <p>'BROOKLYN RULES' (R, 99 minutes) However authentic and heartfelt this film's depiction of life on the meaner streets of the Northeast corridor may be, its story of three friends growing up in a mob-infested Brooklyn neighborhood doesn't begin to match ''The Sopranos'' in its epic vision of violence, class struggle and upward mobility in a barbarous culture. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'BUG' (R, 102 minutes) In this overwrought psychodrama from the director William Friedkin, Ashley Judd's acting continues to surpass her career choices. Playing a shaky Oklahoma barmaid, she convincingly juggles an abusive husband (Harry Connick Jr.) and a newfound lover (Michael Shannon) who sees creepy-crawlies in the mattress and conspiracies everywhere. Though the movie's escalating hysteria may strain credulity, Ms. Judd has never been more believable as a woman condemned to attract the wrong kind of man. (Jeannette Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'DAY NIGHT DAY NIGHT' (No rating, 94 minutes) For most of its 94 minutes, this gripping but evasive portrait of an unidentified 19-year-old terrorist undertaking a suicide bombing mission in Times Square focuses on the face of its star, Luisa Williams. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'DISTURBIA' (PG-13, 104 minutes) A pleasant, scary, well-directed variation on the killer-next-door theme, with the engaging Shia LeBeouf as Kale, a young man who turns house arrest into an occasion for voyeurism and crime-fighting. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'EVEN MONEY' (R, 108 minutes) This grim, lurid scare movie about gambling addiction consists of several interlocking horror stories that converge in a format similar to that of ''Crash.'' More than its forerunner, this film sacrifices realism to forced plot mechanics. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'FAY GRIM' (R, 118 minutes) Too light-headed to qualify as satire, too poker-faced to register as comedy, this elaborate spy spoof, a sequel to ''Henry Fool,'' belongs in its own stylistic niche: the Hal Hartley film. Movies emanating from Planet Hartley are an acquired taste shared by hipper-than-thou insiders. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'FRACTURE' (R, 111 minutes) A glib entertainment that offers up the spectacle of that crafty scene-stealer Anthony Hopkins mixing it up with that equally cunning screen-nibbler Ryan Gosling. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'GEORGIA RULE' (R, 111 minutes) Jane Fonda, Felicity Huffman and Lindsay Lohan play three generations of strong-willed, dysfunctional women in this comedy-melodrama from Garry Marshall. It's a mess, but it does have some vitality, thanks mainly to Ms. Fonda and Ms. Lohan. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'GRINDHOUSE' (R, 180 minutes) A double feature, complete with fake previews for schlocky exploitation pictures, that pays nostalgic tribute to disreputable traditions of moviemaking and moviegoing. Robert Rodriguez contributes ''Planet Terror,'' a purposely incoherent zombie gross-out flick that flaunts is own badness the way Rose McGowan (as a go-go dancer named Cherry Darling) shows off her weaponized prosthetic leg. For his part, Quentin Tarantino, more of a connoisseur than his collaborator (and a much better filmmaker), turns out a brutal, talky and satisfying car-chase revenge movie in ''Death Proof,'' starring Kurt Russell. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'HOLLYWOOD DREAMS' (R, 100 minutes) Filled with movie memories and gender confusion, Henry Jaglom's 15th and most accessible film finds him in a gentler, more wistful mood. Using a rabidly fame-smitten starlet (Tanna Frederick) as his fulcrum, Mr. Jaglom muses over the burdens of fame and the price of success. Knowing but never jaded, the movie is driven by Ms. Frederick's no-boundaries commitment to her broken character, a performance that's as startling as it is touching. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'HOT FUZZ' (R, 121 minutes) A British parody of Hollywood-style action flicks from the wits behind ''Shaun of the Dead.'' Think of it as ''The Full Monty'' blown to smithereens. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'THE INVISIBLE' (PG-13, 102 minutes) This supremely silly retread of the 2002 Swedish film ''Den Osynlige'' proves it's tough to be in love and in limbo at one and the same time. When a rich-yet-troubled teenager (Justin Chatwin) crosses paths with a violently disturbed classmate (Margarita Levieva), we learn that there's nothing quite like a near-death experience to repair those stubborn emotional wounds. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'KILLER OF SHEEP' (No rating, 83 minutes) Largely hidden from view for three decades, Charles Burnett's lyrical film about a working-class family living in a broken-down home in a bombed-out stretch of Los Angeles is an American masterpiece. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'NEXT' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Nicolas Cage plays a guy who can see into the future in this crummy adaptation of a nifty Philip K. Dick story. Too bad Mr. Cage couldn't tap into those same powers to save himself from another bad role. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'9 STAR HOTEL' (No rating, 78 minutes, in Arabic and Hebrew) Ido Haar's fascinating documentary follows a group of illegal Palestinian construction workers as they scrabble to survive in and around the Israeli city of Modiin. With an open mind and a handheld camera, this Israeli filmmaker strives to make the political personal; but by excluding Israeli voices, Mr. Haar has produced a work filled with immediacy but free of analysis. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'ONCE' (R, 88 minutes) A modest, scruffy movie about two musicians who meet on a Dublin street and sort of fall in love. Charming, touching and true. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'PAPRIKA' (R, 90 minutes, in Japanese) In this gorgeous riot of future-shock ideas and brightly animated imagery, the doors of perception never close. Satoshi Kon's mind-twisting, eye-tickling anim√© isn't greasy kid's stuff: it's for thinking, interested adults whose sense of wonder remains as alive as their imaginations. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'PARIS JE T'AIME' (R, 120 minutes, in French and English) ''Paris Je T'Aime,'' a mosaic of 18 miniatures, each set in a different location in the City of Light, is a cinematic tasting menu consisting entirely of amuse-bouches. After two hours of such tidbits, the palate is sated. But if there is no need for a main course, you still leave feeling vaguely disappointed at not being served one. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT WORLD'S END' (PG-13, 167 minutes) This third and perhaps final episode in Gore Verbinski's swishy, swashbuckling saga wisely returns to the high-seas high jinks that made the first film so enjoyable. In service to a typically convoluted plot -- involving British perfidy, pieces of eight and a Godzilla-size sorceress -- all the usual suspects return to lie, swindle and marvel at Keith Richards's longevity, if not his line delivery. Jack Sparrow hallucinates, Barbossa agitates, and Elizabeth Swann is elected Pirate King. Really. Mr. Verbinski knows who wears the trousers in his trilogy. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'SEVERANCE' (R, 90 minutes) A weapons company retreat in a Hungarian forest turns into a bloody game of whack-a-mole in this sophomore horror film from the British director Christopher Smith. The political argument may be broad -- there is some satisfaction in seeing the gung-ho team leader hoisted by his own explosive petard -- but the visual technique is sharp, creating a lively romp through terrain less traveled than you might think. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'SHREK THE THIRD' (PG, 93 minutes) The ogre faces impending fatherhood and a career crisis. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'SHOWBUSINESS' (PG, 102 minutes) This documentary by Dori Bernstein follows four Broadway musicals from rehearsal through the 2004 Tony Awards: ''Caroline, or Change''; ''Taboo''; ''Avenue Q''; and ''Wicked.'' On top of the usual challenges (fund-raising, rewrites, tryouts, marketing), they all had to endure scrutiny by theater critics and gossip columnists. Lively, sometimes cutting but mostly humane, ''ShowBusiness'' is packed with telling details. (Matt Zoller Seitz)</p>
        <p>'SPIDER-MAN 3' (PG-13, 139 minutes) Please, God, make this be the last one. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'TA RA RUM PUM' (No rating, 156 minutes, in English and Hindi) This movie about a race car driver (the versatile Saif Ali Khan) takes place in New York, but that doesn't stop it from being a classic example of Bollywood family values. Here, all the city's a stage set, perfect for ''Fame''-meets-''West Side Story'' production numbers. (Saltz)</p>
        <p>* 28 WEEKS LATER' (R, 91 minutes) The virus that killed off most of England -- after turning its population into rabid, flesh-hungry zombies -- seems to be under control at the start of this terrifying sequel to ''28 Days Later.'' But if anything, the horror is deeper, and the social criticism more acute. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'VACANCY' (R, 80 minutes) This banal horror retread involves a couple of critters (Luke Wilson, Kate Beckinsale) flailing inside a sticky trap for what is, in effect, the big-screen equivalent of a roach motel. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'THE VALET' (PG-13, 85 minutes, in French) If you love to hate the superrich, this delectable comedy, in which the great French actor Daniel Auteuil portrays a piggy billionaire industrialist facing his comeuppance, is a sinfully delicious bonbon, a classic French farce with modern touches. (Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'WAITRESS' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Keri Russell is a small-town waitress in a bad marriage who finds solace in pie-baking and adultery in Adrienne Shelly's wry and winning final feature. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'YEAR OF THE DOG' (PG-13, 97 minutes) Mike White's touching comedy about a woman who loses a dog and finds herself is funny ha-ha but firmly in touch with its downer side, which means that it's also funny in a kind of existential way. Molly Shannon stars alongside a menagerie of howling scene-stealers. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'ZOO' (No rating, 76 minutes) Robinson Devor's heavily reconstructed documentary is, to a large extent, about the rhetorical uses of beauty. It is, rather more coyly, also about a man who died after having sex with a stallion. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>Film Series and Revivals</p>
        <p>SAM FULLER (Tomorrow and Sunday) The Museum of the Moving Image continues its survey of the work of the tabloid-trained film director Samuel Fuller. The highlights in this session are 35-millimeter prints of Fuller's two films for Allied Artists, from the U.C.L.A. Film and Television Archive: the astounding ''Shock Corridor,'' in which a madhouse becomes a metaphor for American society about 1963, and ''The Naked Kiss'' (1964), the only film I can think of offhand that begins with a bald prostitute (Constance Towers) beating her pimp to death with a telephone handset. Museum of the Moving Image, 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us; $10. (Dave Kehr)</p>
        <p>'MALA NOCHE' (Tonight through Thursday) Gus Van Sant's first feature, shot in Portland in 1985, announces many of the themes of his later work but operates with a ragged spontaneity that has largely vanished from his highly formalist recent features. Tim Streeter stars as Walt, a convenience-store clerk who conceives a one-sided love for a Mexican teenager (Doug Cooeyate). The film, shot in black-and-white 16-millimeter, has now been digitally restored and features a new soundtrack remastered by Mr. Van Sant. IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771, ifccenter.com; $10.75. (Kehr)</p>
        <p>SUNDANCE INSTITUTE AT BAM (Tonight through Thursday) For a second year, the organizers of the Sundance Film Festival are taking a selection of films, theater and music created or presented under their aegis to the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The film component includes seven features from this year's Sundance festival that have not yet found theatrical distribution (including ''Padre Nuestro,'' the winner of this year's Grand Jury Prize for dramatic film), so this may be the one chance New Yorkers will have to see them on a screen. This weekend's screenings include: ''Rocket Science,'' the fiction debut of Jeffrey Blitz, who directed the documentary ''Spellbound''; ''War/Dance,'' a documentary by Sean Fine and Andrea Nix Fine about three children growing up in the combat zone of northern Uganda; ''Snow Angels,'' a drama by David Gordon Green (''George Washington'') starring Sam Rockwell as an alcoholic Southerner in the painful process of separating from his wife (Kate Beckinsale); ''Delirious,'' Tom DiCillo's comic portrait of a desperate paparazzi (Steve Buscemi); and ''Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten,'' a documentary about the drummer of The Clash, directed by the music video pioneer Julien Temple. Sunday is devoted to four programs that together contain 27 short films. The series continues through June 10. BAMcin√©matek, BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $11. (Kehr)</p>
        <p>Pop  Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.</p>
        <p>KEREN ANN (Monday) With exquisitely delicate, sensuous songs that seem never to touch the ground, Keren Ann Zeidel -- born in Tel Aviv and raised in Paris -- is the model of the modern cosmopolitan chanteuse, part jazzy, part indie-cabaret and part glam-folk. With Jason Hart. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15. (Ben Sisario)</p>
        <p>ALAN BERGMAN (Tuesday) With a new album, ''Lyrically, Alan Bergman'' (Verve), this three-time Oscar-winning songwriter (''The Windmills of Your Mind,'' ''The Way We Were'') makes a rare appearance at Joe's Pub. At 9:30 p.m., 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $25. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>BRAZZAVILLE (Tonight) While playing saxophone for Beck in the '90s, David Brown learned guitar and started Brazzaville, writing languid, bittersweet songs in a multicultural update of the vagabond cabaret of Tom Waits and Tindersticks. Four years ago he relocated to Barcelona and formed a new version of the band, still singing about crumbling cafes and the way his former lovers held their cigarettes. The new Brazzaville makes its American debut tonight at 9:30 at Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $15. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* BRIGHT EYES (Tonight) In the indie-rock equivalent of Bruce Springsteen's filling up Giants Stadium for weeks on end, Bright Eyes -- consisting of the excessively confessional man-child Conor Oberst (dressed in Prada these days) and whomever he's playing with -- has sold out seven shows at Town Hall, ending tonight. His guest is Gillian Welch, who plays a mellow bluegrass-folk hybrid with grace. At 7:30, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, the-townhall-nyc.org. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>CALIFONE (Thursday) A mainstay of the Chicago experimental-rock scene, Califone plays wistful songs with a constant thin hum. With the Bitter Tears and Curtis Harvey. At 8 p.m., Blender Theater at Gramercy, 127 East 23rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; $15. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* JUDY COLLINS (Tuesday through Thursday) What Ms. Collins brings to a song, whether she wrote it or not, is perspective. You have the sense of a woman standing alone in the night air, gazing at a star and directing a beam of psychic energy into the cosmos. Or maybe she is the receiver of this cool, steady light; it cuts both ways. She is back at the Caf√© Carlyle for a series of encore performances. At 8:45 p.m., Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $150 cover at tables, $100 at the bar. (Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>CSS (Tonight) Over bare, exuberant and deliberately amateurish art-funk, this mostly female Brazilian group celebrates the sacrament of casual sex through come-ons shouted and mumbled in robotic, broken English. (''Kiss-kiss-kiss will make this earth quake.'') With Yo Majesty. At 9, Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $20. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* DATAROCK (Tomorrow) It might seem impossible at this point to find something new on the well-traveled path of electro dance-rock. But somehow this Norwegian duo does it, with spiky disco, a full supply of funk guitar riffs and a rock 'n' roll attitude that mixes snarls with catchy, silly ''Fa-fa-fa fa-fa-fa-fa-fa'' choruses. With Low Bee and Passions. At 10 p.m., Studio B, 259 Banker Street, between Meserole Avenue and Calyer Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 389-1880, clubstudiob.com; $10. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>DEAN AND BRITTA (Tomorrow) In Luna, Dean Wareham expertly channeled the cool, slow-shifting guitar clouds of the mid-period Velvet Underground. Since dissolving Luna two years ago, he has been playing with its former bassist, Britta Phillips, and on their new album, ''Back Numbers'' (Zoe/Rounder), they emulate, with unfortunate stiffness, another touchstone of 1960s cool: the bare, dissolute country of Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra. With My Robot Friend. At 9:30 p.m., Luna Lounge, 361 Metropolitan Avenue, at Havemeyer Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (212) 307-7171, lunalounge.com; $18. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* DINOSAUR JR., AWESOME COLOR (Wednesday and Thursday) One of the greatest and most influential original grunge bands, Dinosaur Jr. joined mopey lyrics to furious guitar sludge, prefiguring Nirvana. Long estranged, the original lineup of J Mascis on guitar, Lou Barlow on bass and Murph on drums reunited two years ago and just released ''Beyond'' (Fat Possum), their first album together in 18 years, sounding as brawny and vigorous as ever. Awesome Color's gruff, retro garage-blues is self-consciously noisy as only New York rock can be, but it is also indebted -- and seems partly a homage -- to the vintage Detroit proto-punk of the Stooges and the MC5. At 9 p.m., Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $25. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>JOHN DOE (Wednesday and Thursday) In the seminal Los Angeles punk band X and on his own, John Doe has linked a rugged sentimentality to twangy, rockabilly-tinged songs, and is particularly good at singing with women. His latest, ''A Year in the Wilderness'' (Yep Roc), features Aimee Mann, Jill Sobule and Kathleen Edwards aside longtime collaborators like the guitarist Dave Alvin. Wednesday at 9 p.m., BAMCaf√©, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; no cover. Thursday at 8 p.m., Living Room, 154 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235, livingroomny.com; $10. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* ROKY ERICKSON AND ALEJANDRO ESCOVEDO (Tomorrow) One of the godfathers of psychedelic rock, who howled like a werewolf over the flutter of an electric jug in his 1960s band the 13th Floor Elevators, Roky Erickson is also one of the most notorious casualties of that era. Now, at 59 and in his best health in years, he is back on the road with a tough, no-nonsense band, and at his belated New York debut seven weeks ago tore through classics like ''You're Gonna Miss Me'' with ease and lots of low-end guitar fuzz. Alejandro Escovedo's songs stare down loss and mortality with a mixture of unflinching memory and a rocker's defiance. At 7 p.m., Castle Clinton National Monument, Battery Park, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789, rivertorivernyc.com. Free; tickets available at 5 p.m., two per person. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>FAIRPORT CONVENTION (Sunday) One original member and two later recruits of this groundbreaking British progressive-folk group from the 1960s and '70s -- the guitarist Simon Nicol, who was in it from the beginning, along with the violinist and mandolin player Chris Leslie and the violinist Ric Sanders -- play an acoustic set of Fairport Convention songs, jazz and swing standards and traditional folk. At 7 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $25. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>MARIANNE FAITHFULL (Wednesday) Marianne Faithfull applies her husky ruin of a voice to songs about harrowing moments and bitter realizations. In songs she wrote herself or chose with exacting standards, she reveals every scar with bleak fascination and no regrets. At 8 p.m., Kaye Playhouse, 68th Street between Park and Lexington Avenues, (212) 307-7171; $75. (Jon Pareles)</p>
        <p>FALL OUT BOY, +44, THE ACADEMY IS , PAUL WALL, COBRA STARSHIP (Tuesday and Wednesday) They could have called it Monsters of Emo, but certain considerations led to a name that is less rock 'n' roll but perhaps just as indicative of mainstream success: the Honda Civic Tour. Fall Out Boy remains the model second-wave (or is this the third?) emo band: snarky and jumpy, interested in relationships over solitude, and bursting with melodic pop-punk riffs. Also on the bill are +44, with Mark Hoppus and Travis Barker of Blink-182; the Houston rapper Paul Wall; and Cobra Starship, adrift in a sea of dance-punk irony. Tuesday at 6 p.m., Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000, nikonjonesbeach.com; $25 and $40. Wednesday at 6 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Holmdel, N.J., (732) 335-8698, artscenter.com; $23.75 and $39.50. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>NELLY FURTADO (Thursday) Last year Ms. Furtado and Justin Timberlake demonstrated a truism of 21st-century pop: work with Timbaland and ye shall receive bucketfuls of hits and be reborn as a star. Opening the show are Kenna and Saukrates. At 8 p.m., WaMu Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741 or (212) 307-4111, thegarden.com; $45 to $65. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>THE HORRORS (Monday) Recalling the early Damned, this British band sticks to dark, cold and gloomy in its albums but comes alive -- or is that fully undead? -- onstage. With Schoolyard Heroes and Night Kills The Day. At 8:30 p.m., Luna Lounge, 361 Metropolitan Avenue, at Havemeyer Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (212) 307-7171, lunalounge.com; $14. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* HOT 97 SUMMER JAM (Sunday) This annual mega-concert presented by the radio station Hot 97 (WQHT-FM) is always one of the most talked-about hip-hop events in the country, as much because of the starry lineup as because of the sparks that sometimes fly between its members. This year the stage is particularly overstocked, with Ludacris, Akon, Chris Brown with Lil Wayne and Birdman, Diddy with Keyshia Cole and Elephant Man, Ne-Yo, Ciara, Young Jeezy, Mims, Swizz Beatz, Rich Boy and T-Pain.

        <p>LONG BLONDES, NICOLE ATKINS (Wednesday) Kate Jackson of the Long Blondes, from Sheffield, England, has figured out at least one important thing about being a pop star: people listen to you when you look good.

        <p>* EMERSON STRING QUARTET (Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday) This eminent quartet, currently celebrating its 30th anniversary, is anchoring its eight-concert Perspective series at Carnegie Hall with Beethoven, played alongside compositions spanning three centuries. On Sunday it plays Beethoven's six Opus 18 quartets in a two-part concert that begins at 5 p.m. and, after a break for dinner, resumes at 8. On Tuesday Beethoven is offered alongside Schubert and Mendelssohn, and on Thursday, the program includes Ives and Brahms.

        <p>DILIANA MOMTCHILOVA AND VASSILY PRIMAKOV (Sunday) Ms. Momtchilova, a Bulgarian cellist who won first prize at the Washington International Competition, joins forces with the superb Russian pianist Vassily Primakov for a recital of Bach, Faur√©, Debussy, Schubert and Popper at Arium, a comfortable hybrid of a restaurant and a concert hall. Arium's concerts are relatively genteel experiences: before and after the performance, listeners are served wine or Champagne, hors d'oeuvres and dessert. At 5 p.m., Arium, 31 Little West 12th Street, West Village, (212) 463-8630, ariumnyc.com; $40; $20 for members. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>NEW AMSTERDAM SINGERS (Thursday) Music, birds, saints and true love: Hallmark sentiment to some, poetry in the hands of Yeats and Auden, and the themes of this program by the noted amateur chorus led by Clara Longstreth and accompanied here by everything from marimba to harpsichord. The evening includes four New York premieres by David Brunner, Paul Crabtree, Howard Skempton and Richard Wilson. At 8 p.m., Church of the Holy Trinity, 316 East 88th Street, Manhattan, (212) 842-1511, nasingers.org; $20. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Today, tomorrow, Tuesday and Thursday) The Philharmonic's Brahms series, conducted by Lorin Maazel, ambles on in this morning's performance of the Third and Fourth Symphonies and then heats up for the next week. A new Brahms program tomorrow evening, repeated on Tuesday, offers the ''Haydn'' Variations and the ''German'' Requiem, with the soprano Celena Shafer and the baritone Matthias Goerne. A whole new program on Thursday brings the conductor Riccardo Muti, and Lang Lang as soloist, in the Beethoven ''Emperor'' Concerto.

        <p>* LUCY SHELTON (Tuesday) The Movado Hour is a series of one-hour chamber music concerts presented by the enterprising Baryshnikov Arts Center in a wonderfully informal salon setting. Tuesday's enticing program offers the soprano (and contemporary-music champion) Lucy Shelton; the pianist Pedja Muzijevic, who is also the center's director of music programs; and the dynamic Brentano String Quartet in a program of works by George Crumb (''Apparitions'') and Brahms (the Piano Quintet in F minor). At 7 p.m., 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (917) 934-4966, baryshinikovdancefoundation.org; free, but reservations are required. (Tommasini)</p>

        <p>* AMERICAN BALLET THEATER (Tonight, tomorrow and Monday through Thursday) It's here at last: the controversial new production of ''The Sleeping Beauty,'' created by Gelsey Kirkland, Kevin McKenzie and Michael Chernov. If even half the rumors pan out, this re-envisioning of a classic should be revelatory, and a trip. The leads -- the Princess Aurora, her prince, the Lilac Fairy and the evil Carabosse -- will be danced by Veronika Part, Marcelo Gomes, Gillian Murphy and Martine van Hamel (tonight); Paloma Herrera, √Ångel Corella, Michele Wiles and Carmen Corella (tomorrow's matinee and Thursday); Julie Kent, Ethan Stiefel, Stella Abrera and Ms. van Hamel (tomorrow night and Tuesday); Ms. Part, Mr. Gomes, Ms. Murphy and Ms. Kirkland (Monday); Irina Dvorovenko, Maxim Beloserkovsky, Ms. Wiles and Ms. Kirkland (Wednesday matinee), and Diana Vishneva, David Hallberg, Ms. Abrera and Ms. van Hamel (Wednesday night). Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, abt.org; $24 to $110. (Jennifer Dunning)</p>
        <p>RENEE ARCHIBALD (Tonight and tomorrow night) Ms. Archibald's ''Oh Dear Natascha'' explores darkness and confinement in an environment filled with small piles of samples and clippings quietly waiting, as Ms. Archibald puts it, ''for an imaginary domestic life in various imaginary cities.'' Well, why not? At 8, the Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (212) 352-3101, chocolatefactorytheater.org; $15. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>LORI BELILOVE (Wednesday and Thursday) Ms. Belilove, who specializes in the dances of Isadora Duncan, will present her own choreography in a program titled ''The EveryWoman Series: The Red Thread.'' The dances are set to music by Chopin, performed live. (Through June 8.)

(Tonight, tomorrow, Tuesday and Wednesday) In its last week the festival will present dance by the Arthur Aviles Typical Theater troupe (tonight and tomorrow night); ''Dancing on Broken Glass,'' a panel discussion on the growth and state of professional dance in the Bronx (Tuesday); and an evening of Bronx-based dance by artists chosen by Christal Brown and Movement Research (Wednesday).

On Thursday night ''Underexposed'' will feature work by Elise Knudson, Irem Calikusu, Dorian Nuskind-Oder, Beth Bradford and Casey Blake, all chosen by Monica Bill Barnes and Shannon Hummel.

(Dunning)</p>
        <p>DANCE AT DNA (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) In Ben Munisteri's new ''Terra Nova,'' dancers leave a design of moving colors and patterns in their wake, courtesy of motion-capture technology. (Through Sunday.) The Stefanie Nelson Dance Group follows on Thursday in Ms. Nelson's new mixed-media ''Out of Wonderland,'' a collaboration with the video artist Nell Breyer and the composer Andrea Ferrara. (Through June 9.) Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 3 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, TriBeCa, (212) 279-4200, dnadance.org; $25 tonight through Sunday; $17 on Thursday. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>DANIEL GWIRTZMAN DANCE COMPANY (Thursday) Apparently Mr. Gwirtzman was once known as ''Disco Danny,'' which suggests that his new evening-length ''Encore,'' set to jazz and popular music, may indeed offer the ''accessibility and entertainment value'' that its publicity promises. Perhaps there will even be a disco ball. (Through June 9.) At 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 334-7479; $25; $15 for students. (Roslyn Sulcas)</p>
        <p>KOOSIL-JA'S MECH[A] OUTPUT (Tonight and tomorrow night) Koosil-Ja Hwang blends elements of dance and music from the classic Japanese Noh play ''Dojoji'' with what she describes as multimedia technology, including live 3-D video. At 7:30, Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 715-1258, japansociety.org; $25. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>* DIANNE McINTYRE AND OLU DARA (Sunday) Ms. McIntyre and Mr. Dara are two of a kind. Or one, perhaps, given the seamlessness of their funny, imaginative and profoundly poignant dance-theater duos. Their program, ''Pieces of Pieces,'' offers a rare chance to see them perform together. At 7 p.m., Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, Malcolm X Boulevard, at 135th Street, Harlem, (212) 491-2206; $12. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>* MOMIX (Tonight through Thursday) A company that revels in acrobatic movement and theatrical illusion reviews a quarter-century in ''Momix reMIX.'' (Through June 10.) Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $44. (Jack Anderson)</p>
        <p>* NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) The week's programming includes ''Three by Bach'' (''Concerto Barocco,'' ''Tribute'' and ''Brandenburg''), tonight and on Wednesday; ''Three Masters: Tchaikovsky, Balanchine, Robbins'' (''Mozartiana,'' ''Piano Pieces'' and ''Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 2''), tomorrow afternoon; ''Essential Robbins'' (''In G Major,'' ''Dances at a Gathering,'' ''I'm Old Fashioned''), tomorrow night; ''International Balanchine'' (''Serenade,'' ''Bugaku'' and ''Union Jack''), on Sunday and Tuesday; and a one-time lineup of ''Serenade,'' Peter Martins's ''Gentilhommes'' (danced by students from the School of American Ballet) and Balanchine's ''Union Jack,'' on Thursday. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m.; New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570, nycballet.com; $15 to $86. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>JENNY ROCHA DANCE THEATER/JASON DIETZ MARCHANT AND LINDSEY DIETZ MARCHANT (Tonight through Sunday night) The emotional and physical interaction between couples seems to be the theme of this double bill at Danspace: Ms. Rocha performs with her longtime dance partner Christine Poland in ''just barely,'' and Mr. and Ms. Dietz Marchant present ''Inflatable Man, Evaporating Woman.'' At 8:30, Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194; $15; members $10. (Sulcas)</p>
        <p>* SCHOOL OF AMERICAN BALLET 2007 WORKSHOP PERFORMANCES (Tomorrow and Monday) Always a mix of radiant idealism and shrewd competitiveness, this event promises extra luster this year as it pays tribute to Lincoln Kirstein, who founded the school and the New York City Ballet with George Balanchine. The young dancers will perform Balanchine's rarely seen but lovely ''Gounod Symphony,'' his ''Four Temperaments,'' Peter Martins's ''Gentilhommes'' and a new work by Sean Lavery, set to Mozart, called ''Twinkliana.'' Tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Monday at 7 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 155 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-6600, sab.org; $40 tomorrow, $70 on Monday. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>* SITELINES 2007: MARTHA GRAHAM DANCE COMPANY (Today through Sunday) This site-specific festival opens tonight with an outdoor performance by the Graham company of ''Steps in the Streets'' and ''Prelude to Action.'' At 12:30 p.m. (Festival continues through Sept. 14.) Wall and Broad Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 219-9401, lmcc.net/sitelines. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>STREB S.L.A.M. 9 (Tonight through Sunday) High-flying, wall-crashing thrills and chills, and popcorn besides. (Through June 17.)

        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>* BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'GLOBAL FEMINISMS,' through July 1. Too much of the work in this assembly of pieces by nearly 90 women from nearly 50 countries is body-oriented and doesn't venture beyond the essentialism of Judy Chicago's indomitable 1975-79 installation opus, ''The Dinner Party,'' whose enshrinement in the new Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art this exhibition celebrates. Thoroughly dominated by photography and video, with a documentary slant to many of its better moments, the show is more about information, politics and the struggle for equality than it is about art in any very concentrated or satisfying sense. That doesn't keep parts of it from being energetic and illuminating. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)</p>
        <p>BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through July 29. This show of about 60 works by Durand has as its centerpiece ''Kindred Spirits'' (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet and journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape. He explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage and rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck)</p>
        <p>GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DIVISIONISM/NEO-IMPRESSIONISM: ARCADIA AND ANARCHY,' through Aug. 6. Ultimately this rare, compressed, mercurial exhibition of work by the Italian Divisionists of the 1890s is long on history and short on truly convincing paintings. The inclusion of works by Seurat and his French, Dutch and Belgian followers clarifies how the Italians pushed Pointillism, Seurat's invention, in all directions: toward realism, academic classicism, Symbolism, class consciousness and even Impressionism. The show opens a new, albeit small, window on the genesis of Modernism beyond the French canon. If many of the works are period pieces, they are also immensely appealing, big-hearted and physically robust period pieces. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'BIOGRAPHICAL LANDSCAPE: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF STEPHEN SHORE, 1969-1979,' through Sept. 9. In 1971 the Metropolitan Museum of Art gave Stephen Shore its second-ever exhibition by a living photographer. (Alfred Stieglitz had the first.) He was 23 when it opened. What he did makes up most of this wonderful show. Mr. Shore has reprinted the photographs digitally, with rejuvenated colors as fresh and subtle as the day the pictures were shot. The work's laconic eloquence speaks of an era and a nation. Its wit and affection add buoyancy to scenes of threadbare America from a moment when the country was depressed by war and years of civil unrest. Its formal rigor makes an uncanny order out of images that, at first glance, look like no place or nothing. Look again. His show reminds us of a period when cutting-edge American art and the tradition of straight, documentary photography got together. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at West 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Michael Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>* INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'LET YOUR MOTTO BE RESISTANCE: AFRICAN AMERICAN PORTRAITS,' through Sept. 9. This show of photographic portraits is a praise-song in pictures, a shout-out to history. It's also a fancy-dress inaugural party for the yet-to-be-built National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. It tends to be a little too fancy, too heavy on glitz, too short on grit. Still, what a party it is, with a Who's Who of charismatic black statesmen, from Frederick Douglass to Malcolm X, and with Leontyne Price, Mahalia Jackson and the Supremes sharing a stage. (See above.) (Holland Cotter)</p>
        <p>THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'IMPRESSIONIST AND EARLY MODERN PAINTINGS:THE CLARK BROTHERS COLLECT,' through Aug. 19. The Met examines the lives and collecting habits of two feuding brothers, heirs to the Singer sewing machine fortune, who were among the leading 20th-century art patrons. Sterling Clark was founder of the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass. His younger brother Stephen was a trustee of both the Met and the Museum of Modern Art (and established the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.) The brothers shared a love of Renoir, Degas and Americans like Winslow Homer, but Sterling ''drew the line'' at C√©zanne and considered Matisse and Picasso ''bad painters and fakers.'' Tracking their taste and how they dispersed their collections is interesting -- and perhaps instructive for contemporary collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)</p>
        <p>* THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'POIRET: KING OF FASHION,' through Aug. 5. A revolutionary in revolutionary times, the fashion designer Paul Poiret introduced unstructured garments that freed women from corsets in 1906, the year before Picasso committed his decidedly uninhibited (and unstaid) ''Demoiselles d'Avignon'' to canvas. But the modern painter whom Poiret most resembles, in his love of the exotic, his brilliant use of color and pattern and his penchant for simplified, almost rudimentary form, is Matisse. This rare exhibition -- from the Met's Costume Institute -- does his sartorial genius justice with a spare installation rendered radiant by hand-painted silk backdrops of the leafy parks and luxurious drawing rooms of Paris. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)</p>
        <p>THE MET: 'FRANK STELLA: PAINTING INTO ARCHITECTURE,' through July 29. Crammed into a gallery that feels like an obstacle course, this exhibition spans 43 years with 25 paintings, reliefs, drawings and architectural models, all with the goal of tracing an evolution that has not yet occurred. Taking up most of the space are enlarged versions of models that are considered sculptures -- and that look as if they date from the early 1960s. The main draws are the examples of the paintings and reliefs that are the basis of Mr. Stella's importance as an artist. (See above.) (Smith)</p>
        <p>THE MET: 'FRANK STELLA ON THE ROOF,' through Oct. 28. Two large Pop Art sculptures, two architectural models and a model enlarged into a sculpture-installation piece confirm that one of the greatest American artists of the postwar era doesn't do himself or anyone else any favors when he strays from the wall to work fully in the round. The results have a certain Stella-like verve but are otherwise generic. (See above.) (Smith)</p>
        <p>MORGAN LIBRARY &amp; MUSEUM: 'APOCALYPSE THEN: MEDIEVAL ILLUMINATIONS FROM THE MORGAN,' through June 17. The symbolism of the Book of Revelation, with its demons and lakes of fire, has a subversive appeal. This exhibition at the Morgan Library celebrates a facsimile of ''Las Huelgas Apocalypse'' (1220), the largest surviving Spanish illuminated commentary on the Apocalypse. The show, which includes 50 leaves from the original text, unbound and installed around the gallery's perimeter, offers a walking tour of the medieval imagination. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Andrea K. Scott)</p>
        <p>* EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'THE DISAPPEARED (LOS DESAPARECIDOS),' through June 17. The most potent show of contemporary political art of the season, and one of the most moving shows of any kind in the city right now. The title refers to a peculiarly chilling form of violence associated with political upheavals in Latin America over the past 40 years, and now becoming more common in Iraq. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo .org. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'COMIC ABSTRACTION: IMAGE-BREAKING, IMAGE-MAKING,' through June 11. This unimaginative and uniformed treatment of a big idea -- the healthy and essential contamination of Modernist abstraction by popular culture -- should be seen if only because it is such a dispiriting symptom of the Modern's paralysis where contemporary art is concerned. Including 30 works by 13 artists from the last 16 years, it alternates between the literal and the arbitrary and favors sincere political intent over genuine artistic quality. Although it promises work that addresses ''perplexing questions,'' nearly everything here is perfectly pleasant and innocuous. The exceptions are provided by Gary Simmons, Ellen Gallagher and Sue Williams. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)</p>
        <p>STOREFRONT FOR ART AND ARCHITECTURE: 'CCCP: COSMIC COMMUNIST CONSTRUCTIONS PHOTOGRAPHED,' through June 16. This show, packed with obscure architectural gems, reopens on Tuesday. Covering a period ignored by academics and mainstream architects, it relies almost exclusively on the photographs of Fr√©d√©ric Chaubin, who spent five years traveling across the former Soviet Union, uncovering forgotten architectural works in cities like Tbilisi, Yalta and Yerevan. The results are a revelation. Among the outright gems is Georgy Chakhava's 1975 Roads Ministry building, a monumental grid of interlocking concrete forms rising on a steep, wooded site in Tbilisi, Georgia. Set on an incline between two highways, the building's heavy, cantilevered forms reflect the Soviet-era penchant for heroic scale. Yet they also relate sensitively to their context, celebrating the natural landscape that flows directly underneath the building. What's refreshing about this exhibition is its lack of an ideological agenda: it is open to all sorts of possibilities. The Gaud√≠esque romanticism of a sanitarium in Druskininkai, Lithuania, for example, spins the aesthetic off in yet another direction. Compelling and easy to digest, this show piques our interest in ways that some larger institutions, ever more averse to risk, often fail to do. 97 Kenmare Street, Little Italy, (212) 431-5795, storefrontnews.org. (Nicolai Ouroussoff)</p>
        <p>WHITNEY MUSEUM AT ALTRIA: MATTHEW BRANNON, 'WHERE WERE WE,' through Aug. 26. Matthew Brannon brings together art, poetry and advertising in a series of letterpress prints that hark back to 1950s and 1960s textile designs by Astrid Sampe and Marimekko. Texts written by the artist and accompanying the images read like song lyrics crossed with Conceptual Art and Language Poetry (which emphasized experimentalism and reader interaction). Consumption and excess are frequent references, as well as how art, design and fashion feed these modern yet primordial urges and desires. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, whitney.org. (Schwendener)</p>
        <p>WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'LINCOLN KIRSTEIN,' through Aug. 27. In the middle of the last century Lincoln Kirstein particularly relished attacking the Museum of Modern Art. Pure abstraction was ridiculous, he thought. It had no standards. Against Mondrian and Pollock, he endorsed, among others, the artists in this show. They are the sculptors Elie Nadelman and Gaston Lachaise and the painters Paul Cadmus, who was Kirstein's brother-in-law, Walker Evans and Pavel Tchelitchew. With the exception of Evans, Kirstein's taste clearly hasn't won the day, but it's never bad to re-examine received opinions or to be reminded of a generous advocate. 945 Madison Avenue at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600. (Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>* WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'SUMMER OF LOVE: ART OF THE PSYCHEDELIC ERA,' through Sept. 16. Tear gas, pot and patchouli were the scents of the 1960s. You can almost detect the last two wafting through this two-floor display of rock posters, light shows, photographs and paintings. But the burn of tear gas, with the association of political emergency it brings, is missing in a show that remembers a lot, but forgets much more, about what was happening 40 years ago, when America was losing its mind to save, some would say, its soul. (See above.) (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Uptown</p>
        <p>YAYOI KUSAMA: FROM HERE TO INFINITY Spanning 50 years, this 24-piece overview is notable for its high quality and for unfamiliar works that sharpen the understanding of this artist's protean talent, among them several small, pungently colored folk-arty paintings that deploy her signature (and obsessive) webs, dots and scale patterns as effectively as her more abstract works do. Barbara Mathes Gallery, 22 East 80th Street, (212) 570-4190, through June 8. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>* FRANCESCO CLEMENTE: PORTRAITS The works in this show reveal Mr. Clemente's relatively recent endeavors as a suave society portraitist, working on commission in single, daylong sittings. His subjects, while horizontal, don't so much recline as float toward the picture plane, surveying us with enormous eyes. The images can border on illustration, but sometimes color, space and personality collude to enchanting effect. Mary Boone Gallery, 541 West 24th Street, (212) 752-2929, through June 30. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* VALSAN KOORMA KOLLERI This Indian artist turns found objects, castoff materials and local stone from Kerala, where he lives, into large but delicate abstract sculptures. Copper vessels become containers for air and space; metal clock springs are woven into a time-rusted open-work basket; the simplest forms are ornamented with embedded glass beads. Talwar Gallery, 108 East 16th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 673-3096, through June 16. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Other</p>
        <p>* MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: PREIS PAINTINGS Seven canvases from two series of paintings rarely exhibited in this country play on the double German meaning of preis (price and prize), some variation of which appears on each surface. They show this famous bad-boy sculptor conveying his usual sarcasm in surprisingly beautiful terms that couldn't get much flatter. Hard-edged and brushy techniques contrast the main tactics of formalist painting while converting the Modernist grid into designs redolent of drapery and checked tablecloths. A preponderance of hot pink argues for the pleasure principle. 1018 Art, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 537-0453, www.1018art.net, through July 27. (Smith)</p>
        <p>OLIVER TWIST Each month this new gallery will rent its space to hip out-of-town galleries, a plan that could unsettle the home-away balance of powers in New York. The inaugural show, while something of a mish-mash, presents works by 29 artists represented by the renters of the coming season.

        <p>MAD. SQ. ART 2007: ROXY PAINE This installation is made up of two stainless-steel tree sculptures -- ''Conjoined'' and ''Defunct'' -- and a glacierlike boulder, ''Erratic,'' by Mr. Paine. The tree sculptures are made from thousands of pieces of metal pipe and rod elements that have been cut, welded and polished. They are real enough to resemble actual trees but not so real that they form a continuum with the surrounding foliage. What captures your immediate attention is ''Conjoined,'' a 40-foot-tall-by-45-foot-wide sculpture of two trees whose gleaming steel branches cantilever and then improbably connect in midair. It is impossible to tell where the branches of one tree begin, and the other's end. But the piece is also beautifully eccentric, a futuristic fantasy of streamlined vegetation manufactured in imitation of the real thing, only much more appealing and exciting. Madison Square Park, 23rd Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 538-4689, www.madisonsquarepark.org, through Dec. 31. (Benjamin Genocchio)</p>

        <p>* MEQUITTA AHUJA AND CHARLES RITCHIE Ms. Ahuja makes her New York solo debut with large paintings on paper of mythical beings,half woman, half animal, dressed in robes as brilliantly colored as the tropical fruit and flowers around them. Referring to the artist's African-American and East Indian background, the pictures turn marginality into a regal condition. The gallery also kicks off its new artist's book program with a display of sketch books by Mr. Ritchie, an artist based in Maryland. Each small book is filled with marvelous watercolors and all but indecipherable writing. Mr. Ritchie has been making such books for 30 years. They are extraordinary. BravinLee Programs, 526 West 26th Street, 2nd floor, (212) 462-4406, closes tomorrow. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>* FRANCESCO CLEMENTE: WORKS, 1971-1979 A selection of nearly 70 little-known early drawings and intriguing photo-works shows this young, restless proto-Neo-Expressionist overcoming the gravitational pull of Arte Povera and Conceptual Art, and broaching themes of the body, sexuality and the inner life that would blossom in his large paintings of the 1980s. Deitch Projects, 76 Grand Street, SoHo, (212) 343-7300; closes tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* JOANNA MALINOWSKA Joanna Malinowska traveled to windswept Baffin Island in the Canadian Arctic last year in the footsteps of the anthropologist Franz Boas, who studied the Inuit there a century ago. The subject of Ms. Malinowska's research turns out to be a Native American musician and Elvis impersonator named Jimmy Ekho, and the film they made together is funny and moving. For another video Ms. Malinowska set a solar-powered boom-box in the middle of the Arctic wasteland, where it will play Glenn Gould's 1981 version of Bach's ''Goldberg Variations'' for as long as the sun shines. Venetia Kapernekas Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, eighth floor, (212) 462-4150, closes tomorrow. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'GORDON MATTA-CLARK RETROSPECTIVE'  I have no doubt that Matta-Clark is now being turned into a hot commercial commodity, but at least at the Whitney you can see what he aspired to be. He came up with various wonderfully harebrained ideas. Literally, in one case: after letting his hair grow for a year, he cut it off as a kind of performance and phrenological gag. The preserved hair, dutifully tagged piece by piece, opens the show like a holy relic. At the center of the exhibition is ''Splitting.'' To a plain single-family suburban frame house in Englewood, N.J., he made a cut straight down the middle, bisecting the building, then severing the four corners of the roof. The retrospective consists of films, drawings, photographs and some of the architectural pieces he cut out of buildings. The drawings are casual and not too interesting, but the luxurious black-and-white photographs from Paris speak more to Matta-Clark's formal elegance. The big message was: Life as art, and art as life, a philosophy dependent on our being properly attuned and keen to the moment. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org, closes on Sunday. (Kimmelman)</p>
