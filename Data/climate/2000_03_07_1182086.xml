        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The fact that scientists are unable to reach a consensus on the cause of global warming (''The Contrarian View'') implies that as a matter of policy, we should vigorously pursue the reduction of greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>This may seem peculiar, but we can view whatever costs are involved in reducing the gases as an insurance premium. If incurring these costs prevents drastic climate changes and melting ice caps, we will have prevented catastrophe. If global warming is unrelated to greenhouse gases, we will have incurred a cost that is, in the overall scheme, innocuous. This is the whole point of insurance: to bear an acceptable cost in order to prevent a catastrophic outcome.</p>

        <p>If scientists cannot be sure of the cause of global warming, neither can the rest of us. In the face of such uncertainty, the only prudent path is one that assures the avoidance of an unacceptable outcome.</p>
