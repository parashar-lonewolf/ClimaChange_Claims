        <p>If Steve Bellone, the Babylon town supervisor, has his way, the town's building code will soon require all new industrial, commercial and residential structures larger than 4,000 square feet to be built in an environmentally friendly way.</p>
        <p>The Town Council will decide in December whether to mandate that new buildings comply with a rating system, developed by the U.S. Green Building Council and designed to cut energy costs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Leadership on Energy and Environmental Design, or LEED, system includes assessments of water efficiency, energy use, indoor environmental quality, light pollution reduction and innovative design.</p>

        <p>If Steve Bellone, the Babylon town supervisor, has his way, the town's building code will soon require all new industrial, commercial and residential structures larger than 4,000 square feet to be built in an environmentally friendly way.</p>
        <p>The Town Council will decide in December whether to mandate that new buildings comply with a rating system, developed by the U.S. Green Building Council and designed to cut energy costs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Leadership on Energy and Environmental Design, or LEED, system includes assessments of water efficiency, energy use, indoor environmental quality, light pollution reduction and innovative design.</p>
        <p>The town receives more than 100 applications a year in the affected categories, Mr. Bellone said. The 800,000-square-foot Tanger outlet mall being built in Deer Park would become the first green retail development in the region, he said.</p>
        <p>Buildings consume 40 percent of the energy used, and green building provides the greatest opportunity to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and move toward energy independence, Mr. Bellone said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bellone said green construction would increase costs only 2 to 3 percent. But Edward Blumenfeld, a partner in the Blumenfeld Development Group, which is developing the new Tanger mall, said the cost increase would more likely be 20 to 30 percent. ''The thought and desire to go green is great,'' he said. ''But this won't be easy.''</p>
