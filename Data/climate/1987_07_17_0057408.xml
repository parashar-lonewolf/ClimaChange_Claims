        <p>LEAD: Six Northeastern states filed suit yesterday against the Federal Environmental Protection Agency in an effort to force the agency to curb power-plant emissions that cause acid rain.</p>
        <p>Six Northeastern states filed suit yesterday against the Federal Environmental Protection Agency in an effort to force the agency to curb power-plant emissions that cause acid rain.</p>
        <p>In the suit, filed in Federal District Court in Maine, the states charged that the agency has failed to meet a 1979 deadline for regulating emissions that cause haze in national parks. The deadline was included in the Clean Air Act of 1977.</p>
        <p>The suit is the latest in a series of cases brought by Northeastern states and by environmental groups against the E.P.A., charging the agency with failing to comply with various provisions of the Clean Air Act.</p>
        <p>The suits are aimed at compelling the agency to issue regulations that would reduce sulfate emissions from midwestern power plants. Emissions, produced by coal-burning plants and other industries and borne hundreds of miles away in clouds, are believed to be responsible for much of the acid rain in the Northeast.</p>
        <p>The states involved in the suit filed today are New York, Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Jersey. They were joined by five environmental groups. Only three of the states - Maine, New Jersey and Vermont - have national parks. Needs More Data, Agency Says</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the E.P.A., Christian Rice, said that in 1980, the agency published a preliminary set of regulations dealing with some of the smaller sources of pollutants that cause haze.</p>
        <p>But, he said, the agency did not believe it had sufficient data to regulate large groups of polluters that cause ''regional haze.'' Mr. Rice said the agency was currently considering standards for fine pollutants that would improve regional visibility.</p>
        <p>At a news conference today in Poughkeepsie, Attorney General Robert Abrams of New York said that one day out of six, haze reduces visibility in parts of the state to less than six miles. In unpolluted air, he said, the visibility in those areas would be more than 45 miles.</p>
        <p>''Haze is the visible indicator of two invisible hazards - unhealthy air and acid rain,'' Mr. Abrams said. He said that because the Federal Government had failed to enact legislation aimed specifically at reducing acid rain, the states would continue to press the E.P.A. through the courts to enforce provisions of existing law that deal with its potential causes.</p>
        <p>Northeastern states have filed four other suits against the E.P.A. under provisions of the Clean Air Act concerning international pollution, interstate pollution, smokestack height and air quality standards. All of the cases are still being argued in Federal courts.</p>
