        <p>Mexico Leader's Reform Comes Back to Haunt Him  The primary campaign for Mexico's presidential race began as the nomination for the governing party has effectively boiled down to a two-man race. Although the President renounced the tradition under which Mexican presidents have long picked the party candidate, the major challenger, who is ahead in the polls, is someone with whom he already has had one showdown. The President may have to decide whether to honor his pledge or reassert his power to block a longtime nemesis.</p>

        <p>Kosovo Church Explosion  NATO troops were guarding the half-built Serbian Orthodox cathedral in Pristina after a thunderous explosion damaged the interior. A spokesman for the leader of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Kosovo denounced the attack as part of a campaign by Kosovo Albanians to remove all traces of the church in Kosovo. It roused strong condemnation from the United Nations and NATO representatives.</p>

        <p>Battle Over Germany's Course  As the German Chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, takes his party toward the right, resistance is mounting and a fight for the soul of Germany's Social Democratic Party has erupted between Mr. Schroder and workers who feel that their party has abandoned them.</p>

        <p>China-Taiwan Tension Rises  Chinese authorities seized a Taiwan freighter over the weekend near a Taiwan military post on Matsu, a heavily fortified island under Taiwan control. The incident provoked concern in Taiwan that China might have acted improperly, using the ship as a pretext to aggravate a strained situation.</p>

        <p>Debts and Departures Hobble Christian Coalition  The Christian Coalition, which for 10 years has led the charge of the religious right in national and local politics, is now weathering serious financial and leadership turmoil that could affect its ability to exert widespread influence in the 2000 elections, staff members say. The coalition is hobbled by a $2.5 million debt, the departure of most of its experienced leaders and so much turnover in local leadership that it has strong affiliates in no more than seven states, down from the 48 it claimed last year, the staff members say.</p>

        <p>A Daring New Type of Donor  The use of a living donor to provide a liver transplant for an adult is a new and daring procedure, but it is catching on. Doctors say it could rewrite the history of liver transplantation, letting people bypass waiting lists and schedule surgery when it is best for the patient, rather than when an organ becomes available.</p>

        <p>Heat's Death Toll Rises  The number of deaths from last week's record-breaking heat wave rose, even as temperatures began to drop across the Midwest. Nationwide, at least 185 have died since July 19, 80 of them in Illinois.</p>

        <p>Debate on Tax Cut Continues  Democrats raised stiff opposition to a proposed $792 billion Republican tax-cut package, but the Republicans were determined to press on in an effort to reconcile the House and Senate versions of the bill and gain final passage of the measure. Moderates in both parties held out hope for an autumn compromise that would give Americans a tax cut over the next decade and preserve needed Federal programs, but one moderate said there was a good chance that neither side would get what it wanted.</p>

        <p>New Life for Bay Oysters  Scientists say it is a critical turning point in the beleaguered life of the once supreme Chesapeake Bay oyster: a consensus on an oyster reef laboriously created by an armada of scientists and hundreds of volunteers. The reef agreement marks a moment of rare optimism about the tattered health of the oyster and, by extension, the bay itself.</p>

        <p>Mrs. Clinton Speaks Out  Hillary Rodham Clinton says in a magazine interview that she thought her husband had overcome his womanizing 10 years ago. But she said that deep scars from abuse he suffered as a child had led to his infidelity and he had not sufficiently examined those problems to conquer them.</p>

        <p>A Bullet in the Desert  Amtrak's first new train in a generation, the fastest on the continent, is scheduled to be zipping passengers past crowded highways and runways from Washington to Boston by the end of the year. But on its test runs in Pueblo, Colo., it flies by cactus and rattlesnakes, and encounters the occasional antelope.</p>

        <p>A Nation of Teen-Agers United by Cell Phones  A growing number of teen-agers across the country have acquired cell phones, a trend sparked by the recent drop in wireless phone service costs. Although the vast majority of teen-agers use them to talk to their parents daily, most young people consider their phones a lifeline to their friends.</p>

        <p>Renaissance Along the Hudson  A real estate boom is taking place up and down New Jersey's industrial coast, and developers are reshaping the skyline from Bayonne to the George Washington Bridge. Like the one that ended so abruptly a decade ago, the current building boom is fueled by the surging economy in Manhattan. But the prospect of economic bounty is tempered by fears of congestion and memories of what happened in the late 80's, when the stock market crash of 1987 sent the region into a tailspin. Some developers and investors worry that with so many apartments and town houses under construction, the supply may soon exceed the demand.</p>

        <p>Underfoot, the Good News  Hopes are high for a vintage year in the vineyards of Suffolk County, where the dry, sunny weather has been ideal for the grapes. The secret is in the Bridgehampton loam, a clay-and-loam soil mix that lies under the vineyard.</p>

        <p>Camp License Suspended  Several parents contended that state authorities in Connecticut overreacted when they suspended the license of the Shadybrook Camp and Learning Center, a camp for handicapped youngsters. Officials said they had documented incidents of abuse or neglect of campers, and had found unsafe or unsanitary conditions, record-keeping deficiencies and inadequate supervision.</p>

        <p>Fewer Votes for Microsoft  Microsoft is thriving, the shareholders are rich and its name is synonymous with high technology and success. But in a new nationwide survey, 60 percent of the people who use a computer at work or at home said that they had a favorable opinion of Microsoft, down from 67 percent just a year ago.</p>
