        <p>Vice President Al Gore's 1992 environmental credo, ''Earth in the Balance,'' is being reissued next week in conjunction with the 30th anniversary of Earth Day, and Republicans say they could not be happier.</p>
        <p>In a new foreword, Mr. Gore writes that ''the environment should be a central issue in the year 2000'' and argues that the threat of global warming, the focus of his book, has only become more apparent and more urgent since he wrote it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore acknowledges that his adversaries consider him ''too environmental'' in the book but he says he welcomes the accusation. He even provides a helpful footnote directing critics to the most controversial suggestion in the book, calling for a worldwide effort aimed at ''eliminating the internal combustion engine over, say, a 25-year period.''</p>
        <p>Since the book was first published by Houghton Mifflin, just months before Mr. Gore became the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, Republicans and conservatives have viewed ''Earth in the Balance'' as rich political fodder.</p>
        <p>Many can quote chapter and verse about Mr. Gore's rallying cry to try to replace the internal combustion engine, his plea for a worldwide Marshall Plan to deal with environmental problems and his repeated plea to make ''the effort to save the global environment the central organizing principle of our civilization.''</p>
        <p>Democrats and Mr. Gore's allies in the environmental movement counter that ''Earth in the Balance'' simply shows that Mr. Gore was ahead of his time. They maintain that concerns over issues like global warming have become so solidly mainstream, so middle-class American, that Republicans raise them only at their own risk.</p>
        <p>For example, Dan Weiss, political director of the Sierra Club, said his organization recently asked voters in focus groups in Michigan and New Jersey about Mr. Gore's comment on the internal combustion engine, and the general reaction was that it was a good idea but unlikely to come about. Still, the fact that Democrats and their allies are studying the political implications of ''Earth in the Balance'' so intensely suggests the struggles to come.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the campaign of the apparent Republican nominee, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, offered a relatively low-key response to the reissue. ''Al Gore will have plenty more time to become an even better author beginning in 2001,'' said the spokesman, Ari Fleischer.</p>
        <p>But elsewhere in the party, the attack is unstinting. Indeed, Republicans have a full-blown critique of the book that revolves around the accusation that Mr. Gore is not an environmentalist, but an environmental extremist.</p>
        <p>''Like Gore's nearly quarter-century of public life, 'Earth in the Balance' is plagued by a combination of liberalism, elitism, hypocrisy and hyperbole, punctuated by an unhealthy extremism,'' assert materials prepared by a Republican research analyst developing a critique of the book.</p>
        <p>''When Al Gore writes that 'we must make the rescue of the environment the central organizing principle of civilization,' Gore is saying that his governing philosophy would be influenced less by the need for jobs and new technologies than by Gore's personal environmental concerns,'' the document adds.</p>
        <p>Clifford May, communications director of the Republican National Committee, said of Mr. Gore: ''I think he'll be seen by anybody who reads his book as an environmental extremist -- somebody who wants gas prices to go up, somebody who wants to take middle-class people out of their S.U.V.'s and to prevent inner-city people from moving to the suburbs. And his view of America as a dysfunctional society should give everybody pause.''</p>
        <p>The committee has sold copies of the book ''equipped with an environmentally safe, nonozone depleting candle to read it by.''</p>
        <p>And Grover Norquist, who heads a conservative group called Americans for Tax Reform, has devoted part of his group's Web site to quotations from ''Earth in the Balance,'' interspersed with quotations from the manifesto written by Theodore J. Kaczynski, who pleaded guilty in 1998 to the Unabomb killings. The headline: ''Did Al Gore Say It, or Was It the Unabomber?''</p>
        <p>Laura Quinn, Mr. Gore's communications director, countered, ''If the Republicans think the vice president is extreme because he's working with the Big Three auto makers to help them develop cleaner cars, if they think he's extreme because in the Clinton-Gore years we've had the cleanest environment in a generation with the longest economic expansion ever, then they're so far to the right they've fallen off a cliff.''</p>
        <p>In fact, the environmental issue is complicated for both sides. Pollsters in both parties say that environmentalism is now a ''national value,'' and thus no candidate can afford to be perceived as ''anti-environment.''</p>
        <p>As Robert Teeter, a pollster who was the chairman of President George Bush's 1992 re-election campaign, put it, ''We're now 30 years after Earth Day, and there's a huge number of Americans who consider themselves environmentalists in one way or another.''</p>
        <p>Being considered sensitive on the environment is thus a threshold test of national credibility, and Democrats and their allies contend that the younger Mr. Bush will have trouble passing it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weiss, the Sierra Club official, asserts, ''Republicans run a real risk every time they bring up the environment because it creates an opportunity to remind voters of Bush's terrible environmental record in Texas.''</p>
        <p>In his new foreword, Mr. Gore notes that since he wrote ''Earth in the Balance,'' ''Houston has taken over as the city with the worst air pollution in America.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Teeter says that in an election dominated by middle-of-the-road voters, the one thing a candidate has to avoid is the image of extremism -- ''on anything.''</p>
        <p>This helps explain the Republican strategy against Mr. Gore. And there is some irony here; in the primaries, Mr. Gore worried about losing support from some people active in the environmental movement who questioned his commitment to the cause.</p>
        <p>In the midst of this partisan swirl is the publisher, Houghton Mifflin, which decided to reissue the book because ''it was on the New York Times best-seller list for 28 weeks and it's become a classic,'' said a spokesman, Walter Vatter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vatter added that there were no other changes to the book besides the new foreword.</p>
        <p>In that foreword, Mr. Gore strikes an unapologetic tone. On replacing the internal combustion engine in 25 years, Mr. Gore says that ''it is possible, it neeeds to be done, it will create more jobs not destroy jobs.''</p>
        <p>''Earth in the Balance'' has a strikingly reflective tone and is widely considered to be Mr. Gore's midlife crisis book, written when Mr. Gore was trying to recover from his disastrous 1988 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, while coping with the serious injuries of his son, who had been hit by a car.</p>
