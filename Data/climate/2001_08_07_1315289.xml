        <p>Still looking for an effective and harmless way to keep mosquitoes from spoiling your summer? Get a cow or a pig. No kidding. Given a choice, the females of almost every mosquito species studied greatly preferred their blood to ours.</p>
        <p>Even a dog can help, though it's almost as painful to see my dog surrounded by a horde of winged beasts, especially when they realize that his eyelids provide easier access to his blood than his thick coat.</p>
        <p>But if you've already succumbed to the claims for bug zappers and ultrasonic gadgets, you've wasted your time and money and  you are probably doing more harm than good by killing helpful insects, some of which actually eat mosquitoes.</p>
        <p>With one possible exception (a costly propane-operated device based on mosquito behavior), the time-honored solutions seem to work best: protective loose-fitting clothing (with or without a repellent spray), a DEET-containing repellent on exposed or only lightly covered skin, and citronella candles or citronella oil lamps outdoors.</p>
        <p>The banning of DDT in the 1970's prompted an intensive search for a safe, effective way to diminish or eradicate mosquitoes that hatch in populated areas. Researchers have tried introducing large numbers of sterile males (they don't bite) to mate with blood-seeking females, making them unavailable to other males, because female mosquitoes mate only once. And they've tried breeding a cannibalistic mosquito whose larvae can each consume up to 250 other mosquito larvae as it passes through its four larval stages.</p>
        <p>So far, as the residents of areas flooded last spring know well, nothing has worked. The local bird and bat populations may be thriving on the crop of mosquitoes that continue to hatch, but people are suffering. I am among them. I spend half the summer in a cabin at the edge of a river that rose several feet above its banks in April.</p>
        <p>What Mosquitoes Seek</p>
        <p>The females of most mosquito species require a blood meal to support their developing eggs. While they will attack whoever is handiest, they are more attracted to some  than others. They prefer adults to children, women to men and pregnant women most. And they find ovulating women more attractive than those menstruating.</p>
        <p>A time-honored technique for reducing the attack rate is to hang out with someone more attractive to mosquitoes than you are. But keep in mind that mosquitoes are opportunistic -- they bite whoever comes along first. Movement attracts mosquitoes, so swatting at them is a good way to get them swarming around you.</p>
        <p>The main things that draw mosquitoes to their victims are carbon dioxide (which can't be controlled, unless people stop breathing), heat and lactic acid (left on the skin by sweat). Frequent bathing in cool water to lower the temperature of your body surface and wash away the buildup of lactic acid on your skin should reduce your attractiveness to mosquitoes. Contrary to popular belief, colors of clothing are not very important to mosquitoes because the other attractions are so much stronger.</p>
        <p>Some people insist that taking vitamin B1 (thiamin) reduces their allure to mosquitoes, although scientists say studies have not demonstrated any notable protection. Another popular approach is to eat lots of garlic or take garlic pills, a technique more repellent to people than to mosquitoes.</p>
        <p>Controls That Work</p>
        <p>Some years ago, users of the skin lotion Skin-So-Soft noticed that it seemed to keep mosquitoes at bay. It turned out that this herb-based Avon product, now sold as a repellent, contained plant-derived citronella (0.05 percent or 0.1 percent), an established repellent of mosquitoes, fleas and ticks.</p>
        <p>But citronella is not as effective as a lotion or spray containing DEET, the acronym for N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide. The higher the concentration, the more effective the product.</p>
        <p>When applying repellent directly to skin, however, use products with no more than 34 percent DEET (10 percent for children 2 or older) because higher concentrations can cause serious toxic reactions. DEET should not be used on children younger than 2, pregnant women or on children's clothing or bedding.</p>
        <p>While most people apply repellent only to exposed skin, experts suggest treating clothing as well; most fabrics are only 1 millimeter thick, if that, but a mosquito's proboscis is 2 millimeters long and can easily bite through clothing, especially clothing that clings to the skin.</p>
        <p>DEET won't keep a mosquito from approaching, but it can stop her from biting by jamming the cells in the insect's antennas that are sensitive to lactic acid.</p>
        <p>Clothing can also be treated with a repellent spray containing permethrin (Repel Permanone), which at a concentration of 0.5 percent can provide protection against mosquitoes, ticks and mites that lasts two weeks and through several machine washings. Follow the label directions and never apply permethrin directly to skin.</p>
        <p>Personalized sonic repellents (one claims to provide 1,600 hours of protection on a penlight battery) and ultrasonic devices for the yard have yet to be shown effective in a scientific study, said Dr. Andrew Spielman, a Harvard authority on mosquitoes.</p>
        <p>Among devices sold to control mosquitoes in yards, the bug zapper, which attracts insects with black light, is probably the most popular (four million sold in four years) and least effective.</p>
        <p>In a recent study by scientists at the University of Delaware, only 31 of 13,789 insects trapped and counted were female mosquitoes or biting gnats. Nearly half the trapped insects were harmless nonbiters from nearby rivers and streams and 13.5 percent were predators and parasites that kill other insect pests. Furthermore, a microbiologist at Kansas State University found that the zappers could spread bacteria and viruses up to six feet away.</p>
        <p>The one environmentally harmless device based on known mosquito behavior is the newly marketed Mosquito Magnet, which emits plumes of carbon dioxide to attract biting insects, then quietly vacuums them into a net and dries them up. It operates on a 20-pound tank of propane (the kind used for gas grills). One tank burning 24 hours a day lasts three weeks and is said to control blood-seeking insects (no-see-ums, sand flies and black flies as well as mosquitoes) over three-fourths of an acre.</p>
        <p>The manufacturer, the American Biophysics Corporation of East Greenwich, R.I., said that in an independent test in the Florida Everglades, the device trapped more than 100,000 mosquitoes a night. In a more urban area like Newport, R.I., it trapped more than 1,500 mosquitoes a night. The downside: each unit costs about $800.</p>
        <p>For short-term outdoor control, mosquito coils, citronella candles and citronella oil lamps do a reasonable job of keeping mosquitoes away for several hours. These products can also be used safely in screened-in porches that have good air circulation.</p>
