        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>On his recent trip President Bush told the Australians that a 30 percent loss in United States wheat production last year was related to trade barriers created by European farm subsidies. In fact, the sharp decline in our wheat production was due to drought and excessive temperatures in much of the country's grain belt.</p>
        <p>Neither Mr. Bush nor Congress will bring this worrisome news to the American public. Along with six years of drought in California and broken records for high temperatures around the country, the consequences of weather changes in lost crops, dirt storms and hurricane-level wind damage point to the greenhouse effect's becoming a serious factor sooner than anticipated.</p>
        <p>The President and Congress have failed to respond to scientists' urgings to stabilize our consumption of fossil fuel and begin to reduce it. The Energy Department has stymied significant progress on developing large-scale production of solar power, wind power, and so on. The promised huge tree-planting project to absorb carbon dioxide has been forgotten despite its potential for putting unemployed youth to work.</p>
        <p>World food production fell 6 percent last year. Washington, by stalling world agreement on reducing fossil-fuel use, is playing Russian roulette with both our own and the rest of the world's food supply. To have our President misrepresent the facts on a foreign podium is a sign he has no plan to change this dangerous course. FREDERICK S. LIGHTFOOT Greenport, L.I., Jan. 2, 1992</p>
