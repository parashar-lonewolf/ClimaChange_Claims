        <p>Giant earth-moving machines growl across a hillside, gouging a huge gash in the ground. Along the bottom of the hole, other equipment is spreading and compacting a thick layer of clay. Later, layers of plastic sheeting will be added and a network of pipes installed, all to insure that no water seeps into the local water table.</p>
        <p>This is a modern sanitary landfill in the making - an updated version of the smelly, unsightly town dump. Increasingly stringent state and Federal environmental protection laws have forced the closing of thousands of dumps and driven up the cost of garbage disposal in many areas.</p>
        <p>The Southern Alleghenies landfill here must comply with some of the strictest rules in the country, which already exceed the tougher regulations expected early next year from the Environmental Protection Agency. Industry officials think the revised Federal rules will include limits on where landfills can be placed and how they can be operated. Although states set landfill standards, they will have to meet the minimums set by the Federal agency.</p>
        <p>As a result, new landfills are becoming increasingly complex and expensive, costing as much as $400,000 an acre to prepare. Holes in the ground generally will not do; they are likely to be too close to the ground water level. New landfills have complex bottom layers to trap and treat contaminant-laden water leaking through the buried trash. Also, methane gas produced by rotting garbage is in some cases being collected and used to generate electricity. And the trend is to extract more from what people throw away, using separation systems and the like.</p>
        <p>Already, automobile tires are extracted at some landfills for use as a fuel. ''In the future, you are going to see yard wastes separated at the landfill and composted,'' said Donald A. Wallgren, vice president for environmental management at Waste Management Inc., the largest company in the waste-disposal field. ''Wood will be separated as well and chipped so it can be used as a fuel. There will be more emphasis on processing waste and turning it into useful products.''</p>
        <p>As higher costs and stiffer technical requirements drive many municipalities out of the trash disposal business, opportunities are opening for companies prepared to meet the new standards. ''We anticipated greater regulation and prepared for it,'' said John G. Rangos Sr., president of the Chambers Development Company, which operates the Southern Alleghenies landfill, near Johnstown, Pa.</p>
        <p>Even as recycling programs grow and trash-to-energy plants are built, the need for landfills will continue, industry officials agree. Not all materials lend themselves to recycling -disposable baby diapers are an example - and the ash left from burning needs to be placed in the ground.</p>
        <p>Even in the older parts of the Southern Alleghenies landfill, where trash is still being buried under the less stringent previous rules, waste disposal has come a long way from the old trash heap. Among the first things a visitor notices here are that there are no odors and few bugs and that not much trash is in sight. The active dumping area is confined to several hundred square feet.</p>
        <p>''The idea is to not have a big open mess,'' said Steven D. Menoff, an engineer with Chambers. Each evening, the day's load of trash is covered with six inches of soil to discourage nighttime foraging by animals and insects.</p>
        <p>The landfill, some of which is being prepared for future operations, looks like a big excavation project. ''It is a strip mining operation in reverse,'' said Edward W. Repa, an official of the National Solid Waste Management Association, the disposal-industry trade group. Part of the Southern Alleghenies site was once, in fact, a coal strip mine. Now it is being refilled with trash, some collected locally and some from as far away as northern New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Since 50 percent of the nation relies on ground water for at least part of its drinking water, regulators have been paying increasing attention to water that seeps through landfills, leaching out heavy metal compounds, organic chemicals and other compounds. The newer section of the Southern Alleghenies landfill is being prepared to meet state regulations that call for two liners of high-density polyethylene, compacted clay and a layer of loose aggregate honeycombed with pipes to trap the seepage, which is known as leachate.</p>
        <p>The leachate is pumped into an on-site treatment plant that uses one tank of microorganisms to remove organic material and another to extract ammonia along with other treatments before discharge into a nearby stream. When a section of the landfill is full, it is capped with materials similar to the bottom lining, so that as much moisture as possible runs off, rather than through, the waste heap.</p>
        <p>To monitor the performance of the leachate containment system, landfill operators are required to drill wells down to the water table and routinely sample for contamination for up to 30 years after the operation is closed.</p>
        <p>After leachate control, the big technical issue in landfill management is control of gases emitted by the decaying trash, the Chambers engineers said. The main gases are carbon dioxide, which is not flammable, and methane, which is. Uncontrolled, the gases could spread and perhaps seep into basements of nearby houses, creating an explosion hazard.</p>
        <p>To stop the gas, vertical pipes are sunk into the landfill, so gas can rise and be dissipated in the air. Or the pipes can be connected to a vacuum system and the gas collected for burning. At a Chambers landfill near Pittsburgh, 3,400 cubic feet of gas a minute are extracted. A typical single-family house in the Northeast uses 140,000 cubic feet of gas a year, according to the American Gas Association.</p>
        <p>Because it is about 50 percent carbon dioxide, landfill gas is considered ''dirty'' gas, with about half the heat value of pipeline-quality natural gas, which is largely methane. ''There are three ways to get energy out of landfill gas,'' said John Rangos Jr., vice president for operations at Chambers. ''You can sell it to a nearby industrial customer as dirty gas or use it to fuel a diesel or turbine electrical generator. Or you can take the carbon dioxide out, raise the heat value and sell that.''</p>
        <p>Most applications involve generating electricity, which can be efficiently sent to where it is needed. But with much tougher air pollution rules expected soon in a new Federal Clean Air Act, the value of methane as a motor fuel cannot be overlooked, waste industry officials say.</p>
        <p>Here in western Pennsylvania, landfills can be graded to fit into the rolling hills that dominate the region. But in areas where the ground is flat and the water table close to the surface, as in Florida, landfilling amounts to hill building, starting at ground level.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wallgren of Waste Management said a plan describing how a landfill would be used once it was filled needed to be part of the planning. ''They could be parks or wildlife areas, or you could put golf courses or ball fields on them,'' he said. ''You need to wrap that in at the outset.''  BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY</p>
