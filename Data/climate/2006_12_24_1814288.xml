        <p>GOVERNMENT regulators, along with most American drivers, have long understood that the fuel economy estimates on the window stickers of new cars can be laughably optimistic. Even the federal fuel economy label serves notice that the actual mileage will depend on options, driving habits and other conditions.</p>
        <p>So this month the Environmental Protection Agency revised its method for calculating mileage, an effort to provide more realistic numbers for shoppers considering a new vehicle. The change, which takes effect on 2008 model year vehicles, will be considerable; miles per gallon in city driving may drop by as much as 30 percent for gas-sippers like hybrids, the agency says. On average, city mileage for all vehicles is expected to be about 12 percent lower; highway estimates could be as much as 8 percent lower.</p>

        <p>GOVERNMENT regulators, along with most American drivers, have long understood that the fuel economy estimates on the window stickers of new cars can be laughably optimistic. Even the federal fuel economy label serves notice that the actual mileage will depend on options, driving habits and other conditions.</p>
        <p>So this month the Environmental Protection Agency revised its method for calculating mileage, an effort to provide more realistic numbers for shoppers considering a new vehicle. The change, which takes effect on 2008 model year vehicles, will be considerable; miles per gallon in city driving may drop by as much as 30 percent for gas-sippers like hybrids, the agency says. On average, city mileage for all vehicles is expected to be about 12 percent lower; highway estimates could be as much as 8 percent lower.</p>
        <p>The new method of calculation recognizes that Americans drive faster, accelerate more quickly and use the air-conditioning more frequently than the federal mileage tests have been taking into account. It also takes into consideration changes in the ways Americans now buy and use vehicles, especially as large S.U.V.'s have evolved from work trucks to family haulers.</p>
        <p>For the first time, trucks with a gross (fully loaded) weight rating of more than 8,500 pounds will have to carry fuel economy labels, beginning with the 2011 model year. Previously, large pickups and S.U.V.'s in this class (like the Hummer H2) were exempt; the new cutoff will be 10,000 pounds.</p>
        <p>When the new stickers begin to appear, there is bound to be confusion. Labels carrying mileage figures based on the new calculations will be required on Sept. 1, 2007, making it plausible that the buyer of an '08 Chevrolet Impala will see a lower m.p.g estimate on the window sticker than a neighbor who bought an '07 model a week earlier -- even if the cars are mechanically identical.</p>
        <p>Of course, the federal fuel economy ratings were not established for consumer education alone. The program began under the Energy Policy Conservation Act of 1975, after the Arab oil embargo, as part of an effort to improve fuel economy and reduce oil imports. The fuel economy data is compiled by the E.P.A.; in most cases, the tests are conducted by automakers and spot-checked by regulators.</p>
        <p>To enforce a schedule of gradual improvements, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration was given the authority to establish standards for corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE. Under the law, each automaker must maintain minimum fleet averages for its cars and trucks to avoid penalties. But here's the rub: Even though regulators have now agreed that the method in use for estimating fuel economy is unrealistic and needs to be revised, it will continue to be used for calculating compliance with CAFE mandates.</p>
        <p>The decision to approach the fuel economy problem through the label and not the vehicle came from Congress, which tried to address consumer dissatisfaction by ordering the change as part of the Energy Policy Act it passed in the summer of 2005.</p>
        <p>Gas mileage is a touchy subject not only among consumers, but also in Congress, where it took an explicit political compromise to pass the ratings change. Part of the deal was that the older, less realistic formula would still be used for CAFE compliance, which is 27.5 miles a gallon for cars, and a figure for light trucks (pickups, vans and S.U.V.'s) of 22.2 m.p.g. for 2007.</p>
        <p>Beyond knowing that the older mileage calculations are unrealistic, government regulators also know the fuel economy of the vehicle fleet now on American roads (which of course includes older vehicles). Each month the Energy Department publishes its own estimate after adding up the gallons of gasoline sold and dividing by the number of miles driven. It says cars get 22.4 miles a gallon, and vans, pickups and S.U.V.'s get 16.2.</p>
        <p>While there is a general consensus that fuel economy is crucial to America and that the current rating system is out of kilter, the agreement ends there. For example, in the summer of 2005, during the debate over whether to change the sticker or the vehicle, Senator James M. Talent, Republican of Missouri, described the threat this way: ''Unreasonably higher CAFE standards would be a dagger at the heart of our auto manufacturing sector.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Talent, discussing a proposal to raise the fuel economy requirement to 34 miles a gallon, said in floor debate that a Ford F-150 pickup built in Missouri would cost $3,000 more as a result. That would encourage people to buy import-brand trucks, he said, because those manufacturers could offset gas-guzzling trucks with a large number of smaller, more efficient vehicles. In fact, sales of the largest American-built trucks have slipped because of higher gas prices.</p>
        <p>On the other side of the debate was Representative Sherwood Boehlert, Republican of New York and chairman of the House Science Committee. After the E.P.A. acted this month, he argued, ''The sticker itself isn't worth much if there isn't a follow-through on the Department of Transportation's part,'' to change car's actual mileage.</p>
        <p>''Shame on N.H.T.S.A.,'' he said, summarizing the recent history of inaction on fuel economy standards by the department in charge of the issue, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Mr. Boehlert predicted that the new Congress would toughen the standards.</p>
        <p>The auto industry liked the change to the mileage calculation because it implies that drivers, not vehicles, are out of step with test procedures. A spokeswoman for the Alliance of Auto Manufacturers, Gloria Bergquist, said, ''How you drive really is the most important factor.''</p>
        <p>Some incoming members of Congress plan to raise the issue of fuel economy in the next session, but it is not clear whether there is a consensus for tougher standards on cars. For light trucks, the Transportation Department has already ordered improvements in fuel economy, subject to economic feasibility and safety, but the change is modest, about 8 percent.</p>
        <p>It did, however, change the system, setting a sliding scale based on each vehicle's size. That had the effect of making fuel economy important to the manufacturers of each vehicle.</p>
        <p>In contrast, the system in place for cars sets a corporate average, so that a company that specializes in small cars need not worry about improving its fuel economy, while a company that makes big cars may struggle to meet the standard. The Transportation Department has asked Congress to change the car rules to resemble the truck rules, so far without effect.</p>
        <p>And while the new Congress will have a Democratic majority, the impact of that change on fuel economy rules is not clear; the issue has never broken down cleanly along party lines. Some Republicans have always looked with sympathy on the interests of the Detroit manufacturers and opposed fuel mandates; others have favored conservation.</p>
        <p>Some Democrats were in the conservation category, too, but others took the position of the United Auto Workers, which has generally opposed stricter mandates.</p>
        <p>The deeper problem, though, is that there is no free energy lunch, and cars with better fuel economy may seem less attractive in other ways. The mileage heroes may be smaller or slower; they may be priced higher because they are built with expensive, lightweight materials or use complex powertrains, as gas-electric hybrids do.</p>
        <p>And the federal government's recent track record on reducing oil dependence is dismal. In 1992, stung by the run-up in prices after Iraq invaded Kuwait, Congress passed an energy law that called for 10 percent of cars to run on something other than gasoline by the then far-off year of 2000. But the price of gasoline came back down, and the Energy Department found it could not swim against the economic tide. So transportation is still 97 percent dependent on oil.</p>
        <p>There is another route, however. Many of the mandates on car emissions originated with California and spread to other states and the federal government. Now California and other states are seeking to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, which would have the result of requiring better mileage, since the amount of carbon dioxide emitted depends on the amount of hydrocarbons burned, either as gasoline or diesel fuel.</p>
        <p>The case is now before the Supreme Court, and if it rules in the states' favor, states could effectively regulate fuel economy. Some would probably do so vigorously -- Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California has often said he aspires for his state to be the center of the ''carbon-free world.''</p>
