        <p>On the hottest day the region has seen so far, electricity consumption set new records on Long Island and throughout New England and near records elsewhere in the New York region.</p>
        <p>The temperature hit a high of 96 degrees at Islip between 2 P.M. and 3 P.M., according to the National Weather Service. Right after that, Long Islanders were demanding more electricity than they ever had before -- 4,209 megawatts between 4 and 5 P.M., according to Richard M. Kessel, chairman of the Long Island Power Authority. This broke the previous record demand of 4,140 megawatts on June 26, when the temperature hit 93 degrees.</p>

        <p>On the hottest day the region has seen so far, electricity consumption set new records on Long Island and throughout New England and near records elsewhere in the New York region.</p>
        <p>The temperature hit a high of 96 degrees at Islip between 2 P.M. and 3 P.M., according to the National Weather Service. Right after that, Long Islanders were demanding more electricity than they ever had before -- 4,209 megawatts between 4 and 5 P.M., according to Richard M. Kessel, chairman of the Long Island Power Authority. This broke the previous record demand of 4,140 megawatts on June 26, when the temperature hit 93 degrees.</p>
        <p>Utility officials on Long Island recognized that this was possibly a problem of their own making. They cautioned electricity customers in Nassau and Suffolk County, whose rates were recently cut 20 percent, against being energy spendthrifts.</p>
        <p>''Don't use the rate reduction as an excuse to use more energy than necessary,'' Mr. Kessel cautioned LIPA's 1.3 million customers. ''It will only put a strain on your own bill and a strain on the system.''</p>
        <p>The system is not close to failing. Mr. Kessel noted that there was a total capacity of 4,923 megawatts, including an 18 percent reserve margin. But he expressed concern that there could be a giddy rush to power gluttony by customers who, until two months ago, were paying the highest utility rates in the continental United States. Their rate cut was made possible in the partial state takeover of the former Long Island Lighting Company.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Kessel said there was no way to measure how much of the rate cut customers were spending on additional power, he did say: ''It's a known fact in the utility industry that when rates go down, consumption goes up. Ironically we've always factored in the impact of higher rates. This is the first time in Long Island's history that we are dealing with the reverse situation.''</p>
        <p>The temperature hit 93 degrees in Central Park at 2:30 P.M., according to the National Weather Service. With that high came another conservation request. A Con Edison spokesman, Richard Mulieri, said that the utility was also cautioning its three million customers in New York City and Westchester to conserve energy while they battle the heat.</p>
        <p>''When your air-conditioner is cranking away, it has a tendency to punch up your electric bill a tad higher than normal,'' Mr. Mulieri said.</p>
        <p>''There are a number of really simple things you can do to help, like cleaning the air-conditioner's filter and closing your drapes or blinds to keep out the heat and sun,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Con Edison's consumption hit a record 11,013 megawatts on July 15, 1997, and peaked today at 10,919 at 4 P.M., making it the second highest in the utility's history, Mr. Mulieri said.  He defined a megawatt as enough power to light 10,000 100-watt light bulbs.</p>
        <p>In the six New England states, the Independent Services Operations-New England power grid reported a record demand for today, more than 21,300 megawatts, said Bruno Ranniello, a spokesman for Northeast Utilities, a member of the grid.</p>
        <p>But he said Northeast Utilities, which serves most of Connecticut, fell short of breaking its old record of  5,800 megawatts, set on July 15, 1997.  He said today's consumption topped out near 5,000 megawatts in the midafternoon. He said the utility's reserves had been bolstered by the 1,150 megawatts from its Millstone nuclear power plant, which had its Unit 3 returned to 100 percent capacity operation earlier this month.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ranniello said the increase in demand in New England was due not only to the hot weather, but the overall improvement in the region's economy, leading to the construction of new factories and homes. ''They all need power,'' he said.</p>
        <p>New England's electric utilities declared a power conservation day today and asked residents to cut down on their use of electrical appliances between noon and 8 P.M., The Associated Press reported. This was  not to save electricity, but to cut down on air pollution by reducing the need to turn up old power plants that burn fossil fuels, said Deborah L. Beauchamp, a spokeswoman for Connecticut Light and Power.</p>
        <p>Bridgeport, Conn., reached a high of 93 degrees today. Fran Mayko, a spokeswoman for the United Illuminating Company, which serves 17 towns in southwestern Connecticut, including Bridgeport, said consumption peaked at 1,136 megawatts at 4 P.M. This came close to the utility's record of 1,183 megawatts set on July 15, 1997.</p>
        <p>In New Jersey, Public Service Electric and Gas had no problems meeting today's demand for more than 9,000 megawatts between 4 and 5 P.M., said Paul Rosengren, a spokesman. But it was below the record 9,548 megawatts on July 15, 1997. ''That's the day to beat,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Despite the heat, Mr. Ranniello of Northeast Utilities found the energy to educate a utility novice in Powerspeak.</p>
        <p>When asked if the utility had to initiate any brownouts to save power, he said, ''The utility industry does not call it 'brownouts' anymore.''</p>
        <p>''We now do 'reductions' of about 5 percent, if necessary, but it's a step that is imperceptible to the public,'' he said.</p>
