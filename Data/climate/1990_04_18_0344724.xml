        <p>LEAD: President Bush called today for more research into the scientific and economic ramifications of global warming linked to pollution, but several European officials attending a conference here argued for more concrete and prompt action as well.</p>
        <p>President Bush called today for more research into the scientific and economic ramifications of global warming linked to pollution, but several European officials attending a conference here argued for more concrete and prompt action as well.</p>
        <p>The differences over how quickly to proceed highlighted the opening session of a two-day conference called by the White House to discuss research into the scientific and economic uncertainties surrounding the issue of the warming of the earth.</p>
        <p>In his speech, Mr. Bush urged environmental ministers and other delegates from 18 nations to consider the economic consequences while drawing up policies to deal with the problem.</p>
        <p>The delegates, Mr. Bush said, should ''sort out the science on this complex issue'' as well as explore ''the links between our environmental well-being and our economic welfare.''</p>
        <p>'An Excuse' for Inaction</p>
        <p>But West Germany's Minister for the Environment, Klaus Topfer, said in a statement today, ''Worldwide action against the climatic threat is urgently required, even if the complicated scientific interrelationships of climatic change have not all been fully understood.'' He added, ''Gaps in knowledge must not be used as an excuse for worldwide inaction.''</p>
        <p>The disagreement comes at a potentially embarrassing time for the Administration as several nations, including the United States, focus on pollution and environmental issues in advance of Earth Day next Sunday.</p>
        <p>In the last year, there has been considerable debate within the Bush Administration over how quickly to respond to potential global warming. William K. Reilly, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, at first urged a specific commitment to reduce carbon dioxide, which is produced by the burning of fossil fuels and is thought to contribute to global warming.</p>
        <p>But the White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu, and other officials opposed such a move. At this point the entire Administration, including Mr. Reilly, appears to have closed ranks behind Mr. Sununu's more cautious approach.</p>
        <p>Many scientists now predict that climate shifts will occur in the next century as the gases in the atmosphere retain radiation from the sun that would otherwise be reflected back into space. But in his speech to the conference, Mr. Bush made it plain that more research was necessary and that actions to deal with the situation should be weighed against economic consequences.</p>
        <p>''Environmental policies that ignore the economic factor, the human factor, are bound to fail,'' Mr. Bush declared.</p>
        <p>Several officials of major European nations attending the White House Conference on Science and Economics Research Related to Global Change, said it was time for action to reduce the pollution, mainly from carbon dioxide, that is expected to cause the earth to warm in the next century.</p>
        <p>West Germany, the Netherlands and France, disclosed their own plans for unilateral action to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>Bert Bolin, the Swede who is chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said in an interview, ''This conference avoided bringing up certain issues such as how do you get an effective decision-making process without too much delay.'' He said that while there was a need for research, ''it must be in parallel with action.''</p>
        <p>In his remarks, Mr. Bush said the conference was intended to help speed the efforts of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a panel of experts organized by the United Nations Environmental Program and the World Meteorological Organization. The panel has been given the task of assessing the state of science with regard to global warming and to recommend possible international responses.</p>
        <p>Other Administration officials who addressed the plenary sessions held today, sounded similar themes. They included Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady; Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers; D. Allan Bromley, Assistant to the President for Science and Technology; Michael R. Deland, chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality, and Mr. Reilly, the E.P.A. administrator.</p>
        <p>Several noted that the United States had committed $1 billion to research into global warming and that Mr. Bush had agreed to act as host to a meeting to plan a framework treaty for international cooperation to deal with the problem.</p>
        <p>Dr. Topfer of West Germany said he had prepared a proposal for his Government's cabinet that would reduce his country's emissions of carbon dioxid, by at least 25 percent by the year 2005. He said the cabinet would take up the issue before its summer recess.</p>
        <p>Per Villinga, who is in charge of global warming issues in the Netherlands environmental ministry, said his country was planning to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by 5 percent by the end of the decade.</p>
        <p>Mr. Villinga told reporters on Monday that his country believed this conference should discuss policy as well as research and said that the economic problems may be exaggerated.</p>
        <p>Brice Lalond, the French Environmental Minister, said his country had set a goal of reducing per capita emissions of carbon dioxide, now 2.3 tons a year per person, to 1.7 tons. He did not say when France hoped to achieve that goal.</p>
