        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your Feb. 12 report on the looming crisis in landfill space to receive our trash should unsettle us all. As we move closer and closer to the fateful day when there will be no safe place to put it or the costs will be exorbitant, too little is being done to prepare and install alternatives.</p>
        <p>As a member of the solid waste advisory committee for Somerset County, New Jersey, I can only report that after nearly four years of deliberations we are no closer to a solution than when we organized. As a member of a university research community exploring an alternative to the crude solution of putting it in the ground, I am disappointed and alarmed that expositions on the subject make light of recycling and point us in the direction of incineration and trash-to-energy facilities. What is missing is an examination of composting.</p>
        <p>Composting is a large part of an almost total recycling process. It deals with the 60 percent to 70 percent of the waste stream represented by organics. Composting is nature's way of degrading organics. When conducted in the presence of air, the organics are converted into innocuous carbon dioxide and water. The ash that remains consists of minerals, which make up about 10 percent of the original material. In nature the process is recognized as mineralization since all that remains of a leaf or a scrap of paper at the end of about three years at this latitude is the mineral portion, which is returned to the soil.</p>
        <p>Research demonstrates that what nature accomplishes in years can occur in days, and the heat generated will sterilize the compost of pathogens and detoxify many of our hazardous organic compounds.</p>
        <p>Eric Eweson has invented and demonstrated a three-compartment biodigester that each day accepts 50 tons of trash, discharged three days later as screenable compost. Those items that do not degrade (metal cans, rubber, plastics and the like) can easily be removed after composting by passing the material once through a simple screen. These materials can be separated for recycling. Separation before composting could reduce the waste stream to the biodigester.</p>
        <p>Fifty tons a day seems a drop in the bucket, but a town of 10,000 to 15,000 people generates 50 tons a day. A drum or two can be used to process the trash from many of our communities or neighborhoods. It would keep the trash at home where the valuable compost can easily be used and put the burden of trash disposal on the population that generated it. As a bonus it is a relatively inexpensive process, compared with the alternatives. MARK E. SINGLEY  New Brunswick, N.J., Feb. 19, 1987  The writer is professor of biological and agricultural engineering at Cook College, Rutgers University.</p>
