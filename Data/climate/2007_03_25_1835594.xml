        <p>According to some recently declassified documents, Iraq pretended to have weapons of mass destruction to prevent them from being attacked. Well, that plan worked well, huh?</p>

        <p>This afternoon, President Bush held a news conference where he accused the Democrats of playing politics with the firing of the U.S. attorneys. You know, the attorney he fired for not playing politics.</p>
        <p>Gore told Congress that global warming shouldn't be a political issue. It should be a moral issue. And Congress said: ''A moral issue? I'm sorry you lost us there.''</p>
        <p>Conan O'Brien</p>
        <p>Earlier today, the world's largest airliner flew from Europe to New York and the plane's wingspan is as wide as a football field. In fact, the plane is so big it can carry 500 passengers or 80 Americans.</p>
        <p>Sources at the Pentagon say that several factories in Iraq will soon begin making clothes to be sold in the United States. Because Americans only want two things from Iraq: a stable central government and affordable quality menswear.</p>
