        <p>The House easily passed a broad energy measure Thursday but approval of a major transportation bill hit a last-minute snag as lawmakers tried to advance two long-stalled pieces of legislation that Congressional leaders said would provide thousands of Americans with employment and lawmakers with concrete proof of accomplishment.</p>
        <p>Despite objections that the energy plan was flawed by subsidies to industry and a failure to curb national demand for gasoline, the measure was approved on a bipartisan 275-to-156 vote, leaving the Bush administration close to fulfilling one of its earliest policy goals.</p>
        <p>The Senate was expected to approve the measure Friday. Both the House and the Senate were also planning to send a $286.5 billion highway and mass transit plan to President Bush, finishing off two significant bills that have been tied up for years by regional fights, spending disputes and environmental objections.</p>
        <p>''The legislative logjam we have experienced over a number of years has been broken,'' said Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky.</p>
        <p>Though negotiators reached a tentative agreement on the highway spending plan on Wednesday, the text of the bill was kept under wraps Thursday even as the House headed toward a vote.</p>
        <p>When the measure reached the floor late Thursday night, a handful of House members immediately objected to a Senate provision they said was an attempt to keep a Montana military base open when House members were grappling with base closures called for by a presidential commission.</p>
        <p>''What we are seeing here is absolutely outrageous,'' said Representative Christopher Shays, Republican of Connecticut. The angry objections slowed consideration of the highway bill.</p>
        <p>As Congress dealt with that measure and a flurry of other legislation in the days before it recessed, Republican leaders in the House and Senate seized on the imminent enactment of the initiatives as an opportunity to crow about their ability to get things done -- even if it sometimes took a while.</p>
        <p>''Have we done everything we wanted to do?'' Representative J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, the House speaker, asked. ''Not exactly. But we have done an awful lot.''</p>
        <p>While Republican leaders celebrated, opponents of the measures criticized their costs, their taxpayer-financed benefits for the energy industry and, in the case of the highway measure, the thousands of home-state projects sought by lawmakers eager for public works projects to take home to voters.</p>
        <p>''The transportation bill contains a record 4,000 earmarks, which is an ignominious achievement for Republicans,'' said Representative Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, referring to the pet projects. ''I hope President Bush sticks to his guns and vetoes this bill; Congress could use the adult supervision.''</p>
        <p>But Republicans heralded the two initiatives as a boon to the nation's employment picture. ''This is about jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs,'' said Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri.</p>
        <p>A significant number of Democrats supported both measures, but the Democratic leadership was not ready to rate the work of the Republican majority a success.</p>
        <p>''In the past 100 days, Republicans found time to confirm right-wing judges, to protect Karl Rove and to take up the business of their special-interest friends,'' Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate Democratic leader, said in a statement.</p>
        <p>Trying to complete its work, the House also gave final approval to a spending bill for the Interior Department that included $1.5 billion to cover a shortfall in money for veterans' health care.</p>
        <p>In a move the White House welcomed, the House passed legislation limiting punitive damages in some medical malpractice cases and imposing other restrictions. But similar bills have not progressed in the Senate in the past.</p>
        <p>The energy bill spreads an estimated $14.5 billion in tax breaks over 10 years among the oil, nuclear and coal industries, renewable fuels like wind and solar energy and energy efficiency and conservation. Another $1.6 billion will be spent directly on energy programs and research.</p>
        <p>The bill contains a total of more than $80 billion in potential spending, though most of those projects will be at the future discretion of Congress.</p>
        <p>Supporters said that by encouraging growth in the renewable-fuels industry and raising domestic production of traditional sources like oil, gas and coal, the bill should lead to less reliance on oil imports.</p>
        <p>''It is not a perfect bill,'' said Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee and an influential party voice on the issue. ''But it is a good beginning to develop an energy strategy for the 21st century. It is the best that can be constructed at this time.''</p>
        <p>Scott McClellan, the White House spokesman, acknowledged that the measure would have little immediate impact on high energy costs, saying ''we didn't get into this overnight, and we're not going to get out of overnight.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. McClellan joined Congressional leaders in describing the bill as a step toward reducing American dependence on foreign oil.</p>
        <p>''This legislation helped address the root causes of high energy prices,'' he said. ''It will expand domestic production, it will increase conservation, and it will improve reliability of our electricity system.''</p>
        <p>Businesses interests also welcomed the passage of the energy bill. ''It seems to balance pretty well the research and development and energy efficiency along with additional means of production,'' said William L. Kovacs, a vice president of the United States Chamber of Commerce.</p>
        <p>Though the bill dodged the issue of fuel economy, Dan Brouillette, a Washington representative of the Ford Motor Company, said that new tax breaks for owners of hybrid cars should ''accelerate the expansion of advanced-technology vehicles and to achieve the volumes needed to make them more affordable.''</p>
        <p>Critics said that the bill fell far short, citing its subsidies for profitable industries, exemptions from environmental laws and failure to address automotive fuel consumption or global warming.</p>
