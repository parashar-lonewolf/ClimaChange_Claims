        <p>International 2-5 INVESTING IN APPRENTICES</p>
        <p>A major reason for Germany's long economic boom is its career training system, in which the state invests heavily to turn out highly productive workers. Some say the system rewards training over talent, but few dispute that the country profits from the quality of its workers.  1</p>

        <p>ZAIRE'S LEADER DEFIES THE WEST</p>
        <p>President Mobutu rejected Western demands that he give up power and said he was dismissing his rival, Prime Minister Tshisekedi. In a setback for the Prime Minister, shops started accepting disputed bank notes issued by Mr. Mobutu.  3 TWO SIGNALS ON HAITI'S FUTURE</p>
        <p>Explicitly and implicitly, the Clinton Administration told Haiti's ousted President that it still wants him to return to power.

        <p>President Clinton and Prime Minister Mulroney of Canada both criticized a plan negotiated by mediators to end the crisis in the Balkans. Mr. Mulroney suggested that Russia and the United States be more active in seeking a diplomatic solution.  3 Mediators urged that NATO planes be used to enforce their plan.  3 RAY OF HOPE FOR RUSHDIE</p>

        <p>Forcing President Clinton to scramble again for an Attorney General, Judge Kimba Wood withdrew her name from consideration for the post. The White House feared a public outcry because the judge had employed an illegal immigrant as a babysitter.  1 LESSONS NOT LEARNED</p>
        <p>News analysis: One would have expected the Zoe Baird debacle to have taught the new Administration a few lessons, but apparently the moral of the earlier episode was lost on the White House in the Wood case.  1 A LAW NOT VIOLATED</p>
        <p>When Judge Kimba Wood hired a baby sitter who was in the United States illegally, she was not breaking the law. The overhaul of Federal immigration law was to come six months later, in November 1986.  8 A CONFLICT FOR POWELL</p>
        <p>In his final months as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin L. Powell is struggling to balance loyalties to a new Commander in Chief whose ideas clash with his, and to a tightly knit military culture.  1 CHIEF PUSHES FOR DISCIPLINE</p>
        <p>The Director of the F.B.I., William Sessions, abruptly overruled his senior aides and told them to discipline agents accused of violating bureau rules -- the same rules the Director himself is accused of violating.  1 TRANSPLANT PATIENT DIES</p>

        <p>A Senate panel criticized intelligence agencies in their handling of the prosecution of a bank that secretly financed Iraq's arms buildup.  7 Beliefs: Looking at women's roles in the Muslim world.  7 Metro Digest 23 MORE JOBLESS IN NEW YORK</p>
        <p>New York City's unemployment rate soared to 13.4 percent in January, the highest level in 25 years. Officials said the data were evidence that what had been an anemic job recovery had now stalled.  1 POLLUTION FOR SALE</p>
        <p>The Clean Air Act of 1990 created something new in the annals of capitalism: a free market in pollution. If a company could clean up its emissions, it could sell the right to pollute to another company. But when the Long Island Lighting Company said it was selling pollution rights to another company, it raised fears of acid rain in the Adirondacks.  1 Arts/Entertainment 11-17 A "Clockwork Orange" ban.  11 Avant-garde film maker.  11 James A.
