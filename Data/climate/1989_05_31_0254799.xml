        <p>LEAD: Doug Williams pulled into a Shell station in this Vancouver suburb on a recent Friday evening to fill his 1973 Ford LTD for the weekend. But instead of using a gasoline pump, he opened the hood and attached what looked like an air hose to a fitting in the engine compartment.</p>
        <p>Doug Williams pulled into a Shell station in this Vancouver suburb on a recent Friday evening to fill his 1973 Ford LTD for the weekend. But instead of using a gasoline pump, he opened the hood and attached what looked like an air hose to a fitting in the engine compartment.</p>
        <p>Like thousands of other residents of the area, Mr. Williams powers his car with compressed natural gas, a fuel normally associated with home heating and cooking. Attracted by a price half that of gasoline, he is participating in a project intended to demonstrate that natural gas is an economical, convenient and safe alternative to conventional automotive fuels.</p>
        <p>The experiment, the largest of its kind in North America, is taking place at a time when rising concerns about air pollution, the greenhouse effect and increased dependence on oil imports in the United States are renewing interest in alternative fuels like natural gas, ethanol and methanol. While the United States Government has limited its support to small demonstration projects, Canada's Government has provided financial incentives for relatively large efforts like this one. The Need for Incentives</p>
        <p>The experiment here, which has been growing in scope since it began in the early 1980's, demonstrates that any alternative fuel will need time, financial incentives and imaginative marketing to win acceptance. But it also indicates that some drivers will indeed alter their habits. About half the 8,000 natural gas-powered vehicles here are privately owned cars. The rest are fleet vehicles, taxis and delivery trucks.</p>
        <p>Soon, drivers will even be able to refuel at home.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams said he was generally pleased with the conversion of his car, which can now use natural gas or gasoline. ''I was only getting 12 or 13 miles a gallon in the city on gasoline, so I liked the savings from the half price,'' he said. The car starts easily in the cold because the fuel is already gasified, he added, and needs less maintenance because the fuel is clean.</p>
        <p>But the capacity of the two natural gas tanks in the trunk has not been adequate for his large car. ''I have to fill it up every three or four days,'' he said. ''I wish they had put in a third tank.''</p>
        <p>A shorter driving range is the most common complaint about natural gas conversions, according to the United States Energy Department. The Supply of Natural Gas</p>
        <p>Like Canada, the United States has vast reserves of natural gas that could be substituted for fuels made from imported oil. ''We have 163 trillion cubic feet of proven reserves; that is a 10-year supply,'' said Michael Waters, a spokesman for the Natural Gas Supply Association, a group of producers. ''And there are estimates that there are another 900 to 1,000 trillion cubic feet unproven in the ground. We can go a long way on natural gas.''</p>
        <p>Because the infrastructure for distributing gasoline and diesel fuel is so well established, even advocates of alternative fuels doubt that they will gain adherents on a lower price alone. But a national energy policy to limit oil imports and exhaust emissions could increase pressure on motorists to switch.</p>
        <p>Because natural gas is composed mostly of methane, a simple hydrocarbon, vehicles powered by natural gas emit less of certain pollutants than those burning gasoline or diesel fuel. Industry officials say natural gas vehicles can meet emission standards without the catalytic converters needed on gasoline-powered vehicles.</p>
        <p>But natural gas needs a lift. ''Government support is critical in establishing any alternative fuel,'' said Jeffrey Seisler, executive director of the Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition, a group of companies interested in promoting the use of natural gas-powered vehicles. ''It is always more expensive to launch something new. But government can make a difference in the economic pull toward clean fuels and the environmental push.'' The Use of Subsidies</p>
        <p>Federal and provincial subsidies have been heavily used to promote natural gas as a motor fuel here, along with aggressive marketing by the local utility, BC Gas Inc. ''The Government wanted to promote energy independence and we wanted to sell gas,'' said J. R. Higginson, manager of the company's motor fuel program. ''We saw vehicles as a new market.''</p>
        <p>The big obstacle to the introduction of any alternative fuel is what is inevitably referred to as the chicken-and-egg problem. Without widespread availability of a fuel, motorists are reluctant to convert from gasoline. But without a mass market, fuel suppliers hesitate to make the investment in distribution operations.</p>
        <p>BC Gas worked on both sides of the problem. With gasoline selling at about 52 cents a liter in British Columbia (about $1.71 a gallon in United States dollars), the amount of natural gas needed to drive the same distance was priced at 25 cents. Accounting for part of the difference is that the provincial government does not tax natural gas fuel; there is a tax equivalent to 22 United States cents a gallon on gasoline.</p>
        <p>Government grants are used to help cut the cost of converting a car or truck to $1,175 in United States dollars from about $2,100, and the province charges no sales tax on the conversion kits. In addition, the utility provides low-cost financing. And it leases the storage cylinders, the most expensive part of the conversion, for $9 a month. Simplifying the Change</p>
        <p>At the same time, BC Gas persuaded several oil companies, including Shell, Chevron and Petro-Canada, to add natural gas pumps at some of their high-volume stations. The pumps were designed to look like those for gasoline or diesel fuel, and quick-release couplers were used to simplify refueling. ''You can self-serve the fuel and pay with a credit card,'' Mr. Higginson said.</p>
        <p>Because of the cost of installing a compressor at each filling station, only those with heavy traffic are likely to be equipped to dispense natural gas, BC Gas officials said. As a result, the gasoline apparatus is left on cars so drivers can run on gasoline in areas where compressed gas is not available.</p>
        <p>The result is a compromise that does not take full advantage of natural gas's attributes, advocates said. Because gas has an octane rating of 130, compared with about 90 for gasoline, higher-compression engines could be used if it were the sole fuel, improving performance and mileage. BC Gas officials said the converted cars now lose about 10 percent of their power when operating on gas. U.S. Car Makers Cautious</p>
        <p>American auto manufacturers have built a few prototype vehicles powered by alternative fuels, but have been reluctant to go into higher-volume production without more evidence of public demand. So conversions from conventionally fueled models are the most likely to be available in the near future.</p>
        <p>Driving a car powered by natural gas is not much different from driving a conventional model. A small dial switch on the dashboard controls which fuel is to be used. The car is slightly less responsive than when gasoline is used.</p>
        <p>The gas is stored in one or more cylinders, usually mounted in the trunk, at 3,000 pounds per square inch of pressure when full. Despite the high pressure, gas officials said, the system is at least as safe as the existing gasoline system in a car. The natural gas tanks are much stronger than sheet-metal gasoline tanks, they said, and natural gas has a much higher ignition point, which means it is less likely to be touched off by a spark if it leaks. Best Candidates for Gas</p>
        <p>Even with the conversion subsidy and lower price for natural gas, BC Gas officials acknowledge, natural gas is not for everyone. ''Most of our users are commercial vehicles and commuters who do a lot of driving near the city,'' Mr. Higginson said. ''Anyone spending $150 or more a month for gasoline is a good candidate.''</p>
        <p>At that rate of usage, he said, a car owner would pay for the conversion in about two years. Taxis, delivery vehicles and big, old cars with thirsty engines like Mr. Williams's fit this profile, while fuel-efficient subcompacts could neither accommodate the tanks and other equipment nor justify the investment. Next: Refueling at Home</p>
        <p>BC Gas's fueling network now amounts to 54 stations in the Vancouver area, but company officials concede that finding the right station when the tank is running low can be bothersome. So later this year the company is planning to offer home refueling stations. They will be tapped into the line feeding a home's heating unit and cooking appliances.</p>
        <p>The $2,000 station is basically a compressor that can increase the gas pressure from a few pounds per square inch as it comes into the house to the needed 3,000 pounds. The home stations are planned for slow overnight fills, in contrast with the one- or two-minute fills at gasoline stations.</p>
        <p>Barry Cavens, an engineering manager at the utility, said the station, designed by the Sulzer Group of Switzerland, had been carefully engineered for safety.  Adapting a Car to Natural Gas  Present automobiles can be converted to burn natural gas or gasoline using components that bolt on. No internal changes to the engine are necessary.  REFUELING CONNECTOR: The filling-station pressure hose connects to a fitting in the engine compartment.  GAS/AIR MIXER: A unit that blends natural gas with air for combustion by the engine replaces the vehicle air cleaner. It also filters the air for gasoline use.  FUEL SELECTOR: A dashboard switch selects operation with either gasoline or natural gas.  FUEL GAUGE: A pressure gauge indicates how much natural gas is in tanks.  STORAGE TANKS: The most popular storage tanks hold 300 to 600 cubic feet of natural gas, equivalent to 3 to 6 gallons of gasoline. Larger cars are fitted with two tanks.  PRESSURE REGULATOR ASSEMBLY: Reduces natural gas pressure to a level suitable for the engine.  SHUTOFF VALVE: Stops natural gas flow when the car is running on gasoline.</p>
