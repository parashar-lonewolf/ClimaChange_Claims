        <p>LEAD: TO everything there is a season, and that includes apples.</p>
        <p>TO everything there is a season, and that includes apples.</p>
        <p>Yes, they are in the stores all year long, but apples in April are not as good as apples just off the tree, expert opinion to the contrary.</p>
        <p>In his book ''Buying Produce'' (Hearst Books, 1986), Jack Murdich suggests that controlled-atmosphere storage has no effect on the taste or texture of apples. In this type of storage, the amount of oxygen in the air is decreased and the carbon dioxide content is increased, thus slowing the apples' normal respiration.</p>
        <p>When the controlled-atmosphere room is opened three to nine months after the apples have been stored in it, Mr. Murdich says, ''the apples are as crisp and tasty as the day they were stored; there is no change in texture or flavor.''</p>
        <p>Anyone who has ever compared a newly picked apple with one from controlled storage knows otherwise. Almost instantaneously, they turn mushy. Besides, apples put in storage are dipped in a fungicide that is of questionable safety.</p>
        <p>Apples, like tomatoes and green beans, are best when they are fresh. Yet apples deteriorate much more slowly than most fruits and vegetables.</p>
        <p>There is no better time to learn firsthand about fresh apples than the fall. Whether you travel through apple country in upstate New York or in Virginia, West Virginia, New England or Michigan, or just visit a farmers' market in the city, you will find wonderful varieties that are seldom available in the supermarket.</p>
        <p>You may even find a number of interesting varieties in the state of Washington, though apples there seem largely confined to the characterless and sweet Delicious variety. Nevertheless, this apple has plenty of fans and it is among the most popular in the country.</p>
        <p>Unlike other fresh fruits, such as peaches and pears, that are at their best when they are fully ripe, mature apples become soft and mushy. All they are good for then is applesauce.</p>
        <p>Taste is a personal matter. To my mind, the best apples are both tart and sweet, very crisp and full of flavor. Last week, I tasted 16 varieties, 15 of which were available at the Union Square Greenmarket. This week's assortment is probably different, and next week, the selection is likely to change again.</p>
        <p>One caveat: I had no way of knowing the freshness of the apples. Some might have been over the hill; had they been fresher, they might have fared better.</p>
        <p>The Twenty Ounce, a very large green cooking apple with white flesh, is a case in point. Two weeks ago I sampled one that was crisp and very hard with a pleasing flavor. Last week, two Twenty Ounce apples were soft and mushy.</p>
        <p>Two Tydeman apples, which are cooking and eating apples that normally have a good red color and white flesh, had a peculiar underflavor of gasoline. Ideally, they should be aromatic and sweet.</p>
        <p>After comparing the taste and texture of these apples, however, nothing changed my mind about the best apple around - when it is fresh. The McIntosh is hard to beat because it has such full-bodied tart-sweet flavor and is so crisp and juicy. The variety called a Niagara Mac was slightly softer but equally flavorful - ''wet and noisy, like the Falls,'' said one sign. A Jersey Mac was only moderately crisp and slightly tart-sweet.</p>
        <p>McIntoshes, all of which have chewy skin that is half red and half green, eat better than they cook - except when you are making applesauce. They do not keep well.</p>
        <p>The Cortland, a large dark-red and green apple, was juicy, crisp and just a little less flavorful than the McIntosh. It is a little too early for Cortlands, said Elizabeth Ryan, a pomologist who, with her husband, Peter Zimmermann, owns Breezy Hill Orchard in Clinton Corners, N.Y. The Cortland's very white flesh is good in salads because it browns slowly once cut, like the Granny Smith.</p>
        <p>While there were no Granny Smiths at the market, they are always my choice at the supermarket. These large green apples with tiny white flecks on the skin and a green-yellow cast to the flesh wear their age better than any other apple, retaining their tart flavor and crispness for months. Both Cortlands and Granny Smiths make good pies. The Milton, an eating apple with green skin blushed with red, was both very crisp and flavorful, more tart in nature than the Macs.</p>
        <p>America's pie apple, the Greening, is favored for eating out of hand by those who like their apples crisp, hard and very tart. It has light-yellow dense flesh and a green skin.</p>
        <p>The Opalescent is another crackly apple with tart flavor. It needed more flavor and more sweetness; perhaps it had been picked too soon. At its prime, this very pretty large apple with a red blush on a green-yellow ground is a good baking apple.</p>
        <p>The Gravenstein, though crunchy, had little flavor, a description that would fit the Spartan as well. When the Gravenstein, which has a yellow background with red striping, is past its eating prime, it makes a fine applesauce. Ms. Ryan said it was definitely too early for the Spartan, a small, highly colored red apple.</p>
        <p>Though crunchy, the Paula Red did not have much flavor and the Jonamac was slightly soft, though tart and juicy; a good Jonamac should be better. Stick with these for eating. The Paula Red is bright red and very round with light creamy flesh, while the Jonamac has a dusty red overlay on a green background.</p>
        <p>There were three varieties of Delicious. The Red Delicious was crispy, juicy and flavorless; the Golden Delicious had barely more flavor. Ms. Ryan said they might have been last year's apples. The Mollie Delicious was the best of the three: very crisp, very juicy but not especially flavorful.</p>
        <p>Do not try to cook with Delicious apples: they turn into a bland pulp. Locally grown varieties have the characteristic bumps on the bottom of the slightly elongated body. The Red Delicious is red streaked on a yellow base, while the Golden is green-yellow with a translucent skin. The skin of the Mollie is bright-red blush on yellow ground.</p>
        <p>I sauteed four varieties - Niagara Mac, Jonamac, Gravenstein and Opalescent - in a little butter. While some kept their shape better than others, the contrast of textures and tastes made a lovely side dish. Pies and applesauce are also more interesting if several varieties are combined.</p>
        <p>The best advice for apple buying comes from Bruce Beck, author of ''Produce'' (Friendly Press, 1984). ''The only reliable way to find honest apples,'' he said, ''is to live near an orchard, or journey to one, and to know just when a favorite variety is coming to harvest.'' Or, he might have added, go to a farmers' market that specializes in local produce.</p>
