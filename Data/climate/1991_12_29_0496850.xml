        <p>The end of the Soviet Union and the resignation of Mikhail Gorbachev, though at least a momentary gain for freedom and democracy, are sad events. The fall of a giant state, owing largely to its own human flaws, has the quality of tragedy; and a great leader's peaceful surrender of power again demonstrated the vision that distinguished him, as few others of his time.</p>
        <p>President Bush paid the proper tribute when he said that Mr. Gorbachev had been "responsible for one of the most important developments of this century -- the revolutionary transformation of a totalitarian dictatorship and the liberation of his people from its smothering embrace."</p>
        <p>Boris Yeltsin and Mr. Gorbachev's other successors have yet to show themselves capable of achievement on such a scale. They, and we, might well keep in mind Benjamin Franklin's reply to a woman who asked what the Founding Fathers of the United States had created at Philadelphia in 1787:</p>
        <p>"A republic, if you can keep it."</p>
        <p>More immediately, the transformation of the Soviet Union into the Commonwealth of Independent States leaves Washington the necessity to exercise in a new world a more visionary leadership than it provided the West during the cold war. Military and political confrontation needs to be replaced by a more demanding diplomacy on numerous economic and environmental complexities. These may be less apocalyptic than a nuclear exchange, but are more threatening to peace and stability.</p>
        <p>Even the survival of some or all peoples is at risk in the great environmental issues the world has only begun to face -- like global warming or deforestation -- and on which the U.S. has failed, so far, to display the kind of foresight and courage for which Mr. Bush rightly praised Mr. Gorbachev.</p>
        <p>For the Soviet Union's political and economic systems, Mr. Gorbachev recognized the inevitable, and acted on it, not always wisely but with great goals constantly in mind. For the equally difficult problems of the world's debased and deteriorating environment, Mr. Bush disputes the predictable and acts as if he and his country need take no responsibility for the future:</p>
        <p>* Though the world needs to restrain its use of fossil fuels and emission of carbon dioxide, Mr. Bush proposes oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, holds back from higher auto mileage requirements and shrinks from a petroleum tax that would reduce auto usage and greenhouse gases, and raise needed revenues.</p>
        <p>* Though global population growth still strains natural resources and exceeds the world's ability to provide jobs and decent living standards -- in Latin America and the Caribbean, 44 percent of the labor force is unemployed or underemployed -- the Bush Administration, owing to its fear of anti-abortion forces, refuses to contribute to the U.N. Population Fund, or to support domestic or foreign family-planning programs.</p>
        <p>* Many nations are substituting military expenditures for sustainable development; the U.S. gives high priority to anti-missile defenses against ill-defined future threats.</p>
        <p>In these areas as vital to the global future as a strategic arms treaty, the Administration not only abdicates leadership; by its own policies or lack of them, it provides instead a bad example to a world that now must look first to Washington for vision, encouragement and help.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has not even agreed to attend the so-called "Earth Summit" in Rio de Janeiro, a U.N. Conference on Environment and Development, to be held in June. In sharp contrast, both Japan and Europe are pushing to use the "Earth Summit" to set global targets -- to limit, for instance, emissions of warming gases like carbon dioxide, in which the U.S. leads the world.</p>
        <p>Even with a 30 percent cut in carbon dioxide emissions by 2005, the U.S. still would exceed the average of most European nations. But at least until the departure of John Sununu as White House chief of staff, the Administration did not even approve the concept of global warming -- while many authorities fear the world already may be too late in trying to reverse it.</p>
        <p>Such quiescence is unworthy of a great nation, the last superpower, the leader of the free world in its "long, twilight struggle" against despotism. As the U.S. did not hesitate to spend its resources to prevail in the cold war, it needs now to go forward as boldly to lead a longer, more desperate struggle to save the planet, and rescue the human race from itself.</p>
