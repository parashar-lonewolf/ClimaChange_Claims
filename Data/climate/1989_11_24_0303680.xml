        <p>LEAD: Fearful that waste gases may alter the world's climate, European countries have proposed a deadline for limiting worldwide emissions of carbon dioxide.

        <p>Fearful that waste gases may alter the world's climate, European countries have proposed a deadline for limiting worldwide emissions of carbon dioxide. The Bush Administration was heavily criticized when it resisted that idea at a recent international conference. The criticism is partly deserved: despite President Bush's campaign pledges, Washington is still months away from developing a policy on global warming.</p>
        <p>But the White House has reason to hesitate. The computer models that predict global warming are still rudimentary. The President's science adviser, Allan Bromley, was chided when he said the models' predictions keep changing. But because of the vast economic consequences of setting a limit on carbon dioxide emissions, Dr. Bromley has a particular duty to keep the argument honest.</p>
        <p>The forecasts of global warming will remain uncertain for several years. But there's every reason to take the greenhouse effect extremely seriously. Computer models aside, the earth's climate has been closely related to the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere over the last 60,000 years, as judged by ice cores from Antarctica.</p>
        <p>Carbon dioxide is increasing steadily, and a warming effect seems inevitable at some stage. When proof of the warming finally arrives, the climate will already be locked into a significant temperature rise, one that could alter crop patterns and sea level. Washington should already be taking out insurance. Banning coal-fired electric plants would be a drastic remedy. But there are many actions to reduce carbon dioxide that are worth taking for other reasons. Chief among these reasons is the need to improve energy efficiency.</p>
        <p>The United States still uses energy recklessly compared with Europe and Japan. In America, oil is very cheap; abroad, it is heavily taxed, inducing conservation. The fear of greenhouse warming alone might not yet justify a carbon-based tax or a tax on oil or gasoline, since such levies would curb economic growth. But there are other compelling arguments for such a tax.</p>
        <p>A tax on gasoline, for example, would reduce dependence on foreign oil and the military costs associated with keeping the oil flowing. Each cent of a gas tax would produce about $1 billion in revenues, funds that could be used to reduce the Federal deficit.</p>
        <p>The Administration's greenhouse insurance plan also ought to include incentives for forms of energy that don't produce carbon dioxide, like solar and a new generation of safe nuclear power plants. The Departments of Energy and Transportation are both working on energy policies, but separately and with no apparent sense of urgency.</p>
        <p>''Those who think we're powerless to do anything about the 'greenhouse effect' are forgetting about the 'White House effect.' As President, I intend to do something about it.'' So said Mr. Bush during his campaign. Do what? ''In my first year in office, I will convene a global conference on the environment at the White House . . . We will talk about global warming . . . And we will act.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush hasn't met, talked or acted. His environmental chief, William Reilly, gave a nod last week to the idea of a global conference. But nods and nonchalance will not redeem Mr. Bush's greenhouse pledge. A gas tax, if Mr. Bush could but reconsider his no-taxes pledge, would ease the deficit, enhance national security and buy serious insurance against the possibility of global warming.</p>
