        <p>SPEED records of any type rarely stand for long, but one -- for the fastest steam-powered car -- has gone nearly unchallenged for 100 years. This is not so much a reflection of how difficult it would be to break the existing mark, but a measure of how long ago steam engines, once the leading power source for industry, slipped into obscurity.</p>
        <p>A century ago, however, steam was a contender. A performance standard was established on Jan. 26, 1906, when Fred Marriott, a mechanic for the Stanley Motor Carriage Company, set the land speed record -- for all types of power plants, not just steam -- in the company's streamlined Rocket Racer. It took another four years for his speed of 127.659 m.p.h. on the sands of Ormond Beach, Fla., to be eclipsed by Barney Oldfield in the gasoline-powered Blitzen Benz.</p>
        <p>The centennial of Marriott's record run will be celebrated next month at the Amelia Island Concours d'Élégance, where Stanley will be the featured marque. The concours, one of the premier classic car events in the United States, is March 10-12 at Amelia Island, Fla.</p>
        <p>The notion of steam cars seems quaint today, but they were a natural offshoot of an age when much of industry was powered by pressurized steam. By the end of the 19th century, steam engines were ubiquitous, running everything from factories to ships. As a mature, well-developed technology, steam was a logical competitor to electricity and gasoline as a power source for early cars.</p>
        <p>Electric vehicles disappeared relatively quickly, a result of their batteries' meager storage capacity and high weight. The popularity of early gasoline cars was hampered by the arduous, sometimes dangerous, hand-crank starting routine.</p>
        <p>As a result, in the early decades of the 20th century steam managed to hold on against the ''explosive'' engine -- as Stanley advertising derisively referred to the internal combustion motor. More than 125 companies manufactured steam automobiles. Among American companies, Stanley, White and Locomobile were the most successful, with Stanleys priced higher than mass-market Fords but below the luxury brands of the time.</p>
        <p>Even the most innovative makers of steam cars were not impervious to developments in other technologies: the introduction of the electric starter on the 1912 Cadillac sealed their fate. While gasoline-powered cars became ''transportation on demand,'' steam cars still needed up to half an hour for the entire process of lighting the burners and developing sufficient pressure before driving away.</p>
        <p>White dropped out of the steam business, and Stanley's operation in Newton, Mass., was gone by the mid-1920's. Only Doble, in Emeryville, Calif., managed to hang on until the early 30's, building what many consider to be the finest of all the steam cars.</p>
        <p>In addition to the long warm-up period, steam cars required the operator to keep three separate tanks full: Water for the boiler; fuel to heat the water (usually home heating oil or kerosene); and a second, more volatile fuel (usually gasoline) to keep the pilot flame burning. Finally, the steam-car driver needed to keep the ''key'' handy -- an acetylene torch to light the pilot.</p>
        <p>Stanleys are held in high regard by collectors -- even connoisseurs like ''Tonight Show'' host Jay Leno -- both because steam power remains a curiosity and because Stanley was such a famous name in early 20th century automobiles. Susan Davis, president of the Stanley Museum in Kingfield, Me., estimates that there are about 500 drivable cars in the world.</p>
        <p>Charlie Kuhn, a classic car dealer in Gurnee, Ill., has driven thousands of antique cars during his 20 years in the business, yet his first ride in a Stanley steamer still ranks as his most memorable.</p>
        <p>''A steam car really is like nothing else ever built -- the hissing from the boiler and the chuff-chuff sound they make,'' he said. ''I was more excited about my first Stanley steamer ride than anything I've ever driven, including a Duesenberg.''</p>
        <p>Even an enthusiast like Mr. Kuhn hastens to note that he understands why steam cars went the way of the passenger pigeon: ''I'm not sure I'd have wanted to wait for the boiler to fire up if my wife was in labor,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Besides patience, a trait that seems common among steam car enthusiasts is a fascination for obsolete technologies. The car's myriad boilers, condensers, valves, copper tubing, pipes and gauges give it the look of a Victorian-era Rube Goldberg contraption. Owners take pride in being able to explain what everything does.</p>
        <p>Steam cars also have a kind of ''crossover'' appeal. Some frustrated steam rail enthusiasts look at a steam car as a kind of ''starter locomotive.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Leno's extensive car collection includes five Stanleys and a Doble. In a recent interview, he said he was attracted to the effortless performance of a vehicle whose prodigious torque -- 700 pound-feet -- made a transmission unnecessary.</p>
        <p>''You just open the throttle and go,'' Mr. Leno said, likening the powerful sensation to ''the hand of God.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Leno's reverence for the cars is obvious, and he is able to discuss their elegant engineering and the workings of their engines in great detail. The entertainer will not own anything he cannot drive, and he makes no exception for his steam cars.</p>
        <p>While the wait of up to half an hour to build up steam deters impulse driving, Mr. Leno does claim to be the driver of the oldest car ever pulled over for speeding on a Los Angeles freeway, a 1906 Stanley. Capable of reaching more than 75 m.p.h., Stanleys are among the few cars of their time that can keep up with modern traffic.</p>
        <p>One of the downsides of a car powered by external combustion -- the heat is outside the engine rather than inside -- is that a backfire can occasionally cause a blaze. Mr. Leno noted that while an unchecked fire can result in the driver's being ''simultaneously burned and scalded to death,'' explosions of the boilers, pressurized to 600 pounds per square inch, were quite rare.</p>
        <p>Steam car revivals have been proposed through the years, but even with today's push for alternative power sources, they are not a path to energy independence. The cars need fuel to fire the boiler and to keep the pilot lighted; the most efficient and readily available ones, predictably, are fossil fuels. And the mileage, about 8 to 12 miles per gallon of boiler fuel, offers no advantage compared with internal combustion engines.</p>
        <p>Motorists today would never accept a car that requires a wait of several minutes before it is ready to drive off, an issue that has bedeviled fuel-cell cars as well. To most Americans, the most practical use of steam is to make really nice foam on their lattes.</p>
