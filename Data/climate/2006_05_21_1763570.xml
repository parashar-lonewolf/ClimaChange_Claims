        <p>Alan Schwarz's ''The Weather Was Fine, and the Homers Were Easy'' (May 14) provided some scientific perspective on the spate of home runs in the major leagues during April. Perhaps the article grants us some perspective on larger issues as well. If a team of meteorologists, ecologists and sports statisticians were to bend their talents to the task, we might find that Barry Bonds's remarkable achievements at the plate were not about performance-enhancing drugs, but rather an indirect result of global warming.</p>
