        <p>LEAD: American experts inserted a small camera into a limestone-covered pit at the Great Pyramid of Cheops early today and viewed on a television screen a dismantled boat buried about 4,600 years ago in the golden age of the pharaohs.</p>
        <p>American experts inserted a small camera into a limestone-covered pit at the Great Pyramid of Cheops early today and viewed on a television screen a dismantled boat buried about 4,600 years ago in the golden age of the pharaohs.</p>
        <p>Members of the expedition, which was financed by the National Geographic Society, also extracted air that they hoped had been undisturbed over the millenia. But the pit's air seemed to have been tainted.</p>
        <p>''It was stale and didn't smell of cedar,'' said Dr. Pieter Tans of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, Colo., where the air will be shipped for analysis. ''I couldn't resist a whiff.''</p>
        <p>A primary goal of the project was to analyze the atmosphere as it was 4,600 years ago, long before humans began to alter it by burning fossil fuels and cutting back the forests. Boat's Discovery Was Predicted</p>
        <p>Discovery of the boat had been predicted by many Egyptologists, including Kamal el-Mallakh, who in 1954 discovered a nearby pit containing a similar boat. The boat was excavated from the first pit, but the magazine has no plans to excavate the second boat. Both limestone pits are about 60 feet from the southern wall of the Great Pyramid of Cheops, the best-known ruler of ancient Egypt's Old Kingdom. Cheops, or Khufu, founded the 4th Dynasty around 2680 B.C. and ruled Egypt for 23 years.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ahmed Kadry, chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization, co-sponsor of the project, identified the craft viewed Tuesday as a ''4,600-year-old royal boat built for the Pharaoh Cheops.'' He said boat appeared to be in good condition.</p>
        <p>Using a specially designed carbide-tipped drill, based on technology developed for lunar exploration, members of the National Geographic team bored a three and one-half inch hole through one of 40 stones atop the pit. It took two days to pierce the five-foot-thick slab. A Hush, Then Hugs and Kisses</p>
        <p>The drill was followed by a camera equipped with a light source and a zoom lens. As the light illuminated stacks of wood inside the pit, team members went quickly from a ''hush'' to ''hugging and kissing,'' said Wilbur E. Garrett, the editor of National Geographic.</p>
        <p>''It was a bit like a moon launch,'' he said, ''except we were going down rather than up, and we were going into the past instead of the future.''</p>
        <p>The $250,000 probe marked the first time such space-age technology had been used for archeology.</p>
        <p>In addition to stacked wood, Dr. Farouk el-Baz of Boston University, the scientific director of the project, said, ''the camera showed reed covers, small pieces of mortar that had fallen into the pit and inscriptions hewn by ancient workers into the walls.''</p>
        <p>The boat in the first pit had been dismantled into 651 large pieces, which broke down into a 1,224-part jigsaw puzzle. It took 10 years to reassemble. The 143-foot-long ''Royal Boat of Cheops'' rests today in a glass museum overlooking the new discovery.</p>
        <p>Dr. el-Mallakh says the first boat was intended to carry the spirit of Cheops on an eternal day trip through the heavens, and the second was to carry the spirit at the night. Others believe the first boat was to carry the mummy from the Nile River to his burial place. The use of the second boat is unclear, they say.</p>
