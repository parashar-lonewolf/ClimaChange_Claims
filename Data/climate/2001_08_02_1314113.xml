        <p>In a major legislative victory for Republicans and the White House, the House voted Wednesday night to allow drilling in an Alaskan refuge shortly before it passed a sweeping energy plan that would encourage energy production, promote conservation and modestly raise fuel efficiency standards.</p>
        <p>During a day and night of debate, Republican leaders managed to preserve major parts of President Bush's energy plan while defeating environmentalists on two crucial issues. The final vote early today was 240 to 189.</p>
        <p>In the most dramatic vote of the evening, the House voted to allow oil and gas drilling on a 2,000-acre swath of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, a crushing defeat for environmentalists who have lobbied extensively to protect the area from exploration. Mr. Bush turned drilling in the refuge into a pillar of his energy plan, arguing that searching for oil and protecting the environment are compatible.</p>
        <p>The Teamsters union, eager to create jobs, joined forces with Republican leaders in the uphill battle to persuade members to reject an amendment that would have blocked drilling. The vote was 223 to 206 to kill the amendment, with nearly three dozen Republicans and three dozen Democrats crossing party lines in the vote.</p>
        <p>In a second blow, the House split along regional lines and rejected, by a vote of 269 to 160, an effort to further increase fuel efficiency standards for vehicles, a measure vigorously opposed by car companies and workers in automobile unions. The bill already includes a slight increase in the standard, the product of negotiations but one that environmentalists say does not go nearly far enough.</p>
        <p>But the bill, which also includes billions of dollars in tax incentives, is not expected to remain intact for long. The Senate, controlled by Democrats, is in the midst of drawing up a significantly different proposal, one that is likely to include stricter fuel efficiency standards. And at least one senator, John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, has said he will block any effort to permit drilling in the wildlife refuge.</p>
        <p>That message, along with one of national security, was echoed by Republican leaders.</p>
        <p>''America faces a serious degradation of our national security unless we move at once to reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy,'' said Representative Tom DeLay, the majority whip from Texas, who collected the necessary votes for the bill. ''This bill takes important steps in that direction by promoting initiatives that will allow us to produce more energy at home. We need to take control of our destiny.''</p>
        <p>The votes on the energy package -- a compilation of four separate bills -- comes as polls show the country less preoccupied with drilling and increasingly concerned that Republicans are too closely allied with the oil, coal, gas and nuclear energy industries.</p>
        <p>But House Republicans, taking their cue from Mr. Bush, cautioned that the lack of a comprehensive energy strategy would continue to subject consumers to price spikes and threaten national security by increasing reliance on foreign oil. And they emphasized that the bill took a balanced approach, offering something for everyone -- including conservationists, traditional energy producers and consumers.</p>
        <p>Still, in hurrying the energy package through the House, Republicans acknowledged that they had put off the more complex issues of Mr. Bush's energy plan until later this year. Those include electricity deregulation, the renewal of liability insurance for nuclear power plants and the overhaul of electricity grids.</p>
        <p>Democrats, pillorying the bill's $33.5 billion price tag, accused Republicans Wednesday of planning to raid the Medicare trust fund to pay for it at a time when the Treasury Department is borrowing money to pay for tax rebate checks. Republicans denied that accusation. Democrats also described the bill as a pay-off to the oil, coal, gas and nuclear industries, which contributed heavily to Republicans during the last election.</p>
        <p>''This bill has nothing to do with providing Americans with a more secure energy future,'' said Representative Nick J. Rahall II, of West Virginia, the senior Democrat on the Resources Committee. ''Instead, it is a multibillion-dollar giveaway of America's resources and American taxpayer dollars to big oil, already awash in record profits.''</p>
        <p>The closest vote and most impassioned debate centered on drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, or ANWR, which was created by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The land in question was eventually set aside for possible oil exploration, but the decision requires Congressional approval.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists described the vote as an important loyalty test for supporters and waged an intense campaign to bar drilling in the refuge, which they said would be needlessly destroyed by trucks and equipment if exploration goes forward. The refuge is home to caribou, migrating birds and other wildlife during the summer. The payoff, they argue, would be six months of oil reserves.</p>
        <p>''You cannot explore this area and drill this area without permanent and severe damage to the environment,''said Representative Nancy L. Johnson, a moderate Republican from Connecticut.</p>
        <p>But Republican leaders and chairmen countered that the oil drilling technology is now so advanced it would not harm the tundra, which is a blanket of ice for most of the year. With the United States heavily reliant on foreign oil, drilling supporters underscored the need for greater domestic oil production.</p>
        <p>Representative Don Young, Republican of Alaska and the chairman of the Transportation Committee, said most members who opposed drilling had not even visited Alaska and were simply disregarding the fact that most people there supported the measure.</p>
        <p>''This is a charade; this amendment is trying to deprive ourselves of oil we must have for this nation,'' Mr. Young said. ''How dare you stand up here and talk about something and you have never been there. Shame on you.''</p>
        <p>The legislation includes $33.5 billion in subsidies for renewable energy, conservation and energy production, considerably more than what Mr. Bush proposed in his plan. The bulk of the credits and breaks -- $27 billion, according to government watchdog groups -- go to traditional energy producers, both to drill for more oil and gas, develop nuclear energy and produce cleaner coal.</p>
        <p>One measure would help several electric companies avoid an estimated $2 billion in taxes by allowing utilities to transfer control of their power lines to independents tax-free, if they are required to do by federal regulators. Another $3.3 billion in tax credits would go to coal industry for investing or producing electricity using clean-coal technology.</p>
        <p>There are also a host of provisions to encourage the manufacture and purchase of environmentally friendly cars, make homes more energy efficient and manufacture energy saving appliances.</p>
        <p>The bill also calls for substantial investments in research and development in conservation, coal technology and nuclear energy development. And it would reduce oil industry royalties on some kinds of drilling and allow the industry to pay royalties in kind.</p>
        <p>Acknowledging that the tax incentives would reduce the budget surplus by at least $30 billion, the White House warned it would not support measures that threatened tax relief. Still, the White House reiterated its support for the bill and two cabinet secretaries visited Capitol Hill on Wednesday to boost its prospects.</p>
        <p>Lawmakers repeatedly formed shifting coalitions to pass and defeat amendments. For example, Michigan Democrats, including the minority whip, Representative David Bonior, voted against tougher fuel efficiency standards, despite environmental arguments that consumers would win through lower gas prices.</p>
        <p>That measure would have required sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks to meet the same standard as cars, with some flexibility built in. Currently, sport utility vehicles must average 20.7 miles per gallon compared with 27.5 miles per gallon for cars. The bill already includes a requirement that sport utility vehicles reduce gasoline consumption by five billion gallons over six years, which critics say amounts to less than a one mile per gallon increase.</p>
        <p>''If you want to look at the energy crisis, you have to look at gasoline tanks,'' said Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts. ''This isn't rocket science. This is auto mechanics.''</p>
        <p>But critics of the tougher amendment countered that it would cost jobs and take lives by forcing car companies to make lighter, smaller vehicles.</p>
        <p>''This amendment will end up killing Americans,'' said Representative Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who is chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee.</p>
