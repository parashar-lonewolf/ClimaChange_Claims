        <p>Ohio Edison, the operator of one of the dirtiest coal-fired power plants in the country, has agreed to sharply cut harmful emissions that drift across state lines and cause respiratory problems throughout the Northeast.</p>
        <p>The agreement, announced yesterday in Washington, is one of the most significant settlements ever for cleaning the air and improving the health of millions of people who live downwind from the plant, on the banks of the Ohio River, state and federal officials said.</p>
        <p>The operator, Ohio Edison, will substantially reduce emissions at the W. H. Sammis plant in Stratton, which, by itself, produces 60 percent as much air pollution as all of New York State's 56 power plants combined.</p>
        <p>''This plant is the No. 1 or No. 2 producer of sulfur dioxide in the United States,'' said Thomas V. Skinner, acting assistant administrator for enforcement at the federal Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>Tons of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides pour out of the plant's smokestacks -- one of which is 1,000 feet high -- and travel on prevailing winds toward the East Coast, where they cause smog that contributes to asthma, heart disease and premature deaths. Nitrogen oxides from the plant contribute to the production of acid rain in the Adirondacks and elsewhere in the region.</p>
        <p>Ohio Edison, and its parent, FirstEnergy, with 4.4 million customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, agreed to spend $1.1 billion to install scrubbers and other pollution control devices. They will reduce emissions at the Sammis plant and several smaller plants by at least 80 percent in seven years, officials said.</p>
        <p>The company will also have to pay an $8 million civil penalty and provide $25 million to cover the cost of wind power and other renewable energy projects in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Alleghany County, Pa., which were part of a suit against the company.</p>
        <p>The settlement is the second largest in a series of nine agreements with power plant operators since 1999. It comes more than five years after the New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, and the attorneys general of Connecticut and New Jersey, took what was then the novel step of filing a notice to sue Ohio Edison for emitting pollution that harmed people hundreds of miles away. That was in September 1999.</p>
        <p>Two months later the federal government filed its own suit. Eventually, the state and federal efforts were combined. Sixteen lawsuits were filed before the Bush administration decided to drop investigations into similar potential violations in November 2003.</p>
        <p>By then, a federal court had found that Ohio Edison was violating the Clean Air Act. A second trial was scheduled to determine penalties but the judge encouraged both sides to negotiate a settlement. According to government estimates on the Ohio Edison agreement, sulfur dioxide emissions from the Sammis plant and other generating stations owned by the company would be reduced by 212,000 tons per year by 2012. Nitrogen oxides will be cut by 41,000 tons per year in that same period.</p>
        <p>Peter H. Lehner, an assistant attorney general in New York who handled the suit against the company, said that cleaning up the Ohio plant could prevent 250 premature deaths a year in downwind states. Mr. Lehner said that the reductions could begin as soon as the plant starts using low-sulfur coal next year. The biggest reductions will come when scrubbers are installed in 2010.</p>
        <p>In a prepared statement, FirstEnergy said the settlement ''builds on the significant progress we have been making to protect the environment,'' while enabling the company to continue utilizing the plant.</p>
