        <p>LEAD: WITH President Bush's clean-air initiative pushing the country firmly in the direction of stricter pollution control, some analysts are looking at companies that stand to gain from tighter regulation. The Administration estimates that the cost of compliance with its proposals would be $14 billion to $19 billion a year.</p>
        <p>WITH President Bush's clean-air initiative pushing the country firmly in the direction of stricter pollution control, some analysts are looking at companies that stand to gain from tighter regulation. The Administration estimates that the cost of compliance with its proposals would be $14 billion to $19 billion a year. Industry estimates, which vary broadly, run as high as $50 billion.</p>
        <p>The potential changes in the regulatory picture offer a fairly wide range of opportunities, and companies in areas as different as gas turbine manufacturing and coal and lime production are positioned to benefit from new regulations. A few are already showing gains in their stock prices.</p>
        <p>Utilities have several strategies they may use to reduce the emissions that contribute to acid rain. Many will switch to alternative fuels like low-sulfur coal. Some will improve efficiency by building more co-generation plants, which use excess steam from electricity generation as a heat source. And those with dirtier plants will install scrubbers, bags, brushes and other controls that trap and filter undesirable emissions.</p>
        <p>''The great issue for most utilities will be whether to change the kind of fuel they burn from high-sulfur coal to low-sulfur coal or something else,'' said Ronald S. Sloane, manager of the Equitec Siebel Aggressive Growth Fund.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot of companies that are so far out of compliance with these regulations that they want to do something about it now,'' said Mark Kurland, director of research at Mabon, Nugent &amp; Company, which has just completed a study of companies that stand to profit from the proposed legislation.</p>
        <p>Mabon, Nugent's study concluded that all types of utility spending are likely to increase because of the acid-rain legislation. Among the chief beneficiaries are the gas turbine manufacturers, which have already seen orders increase as utilities move toward burning cleaner fuel. Stewart &amp; Stevenson Services Inc., a Houston manufacturer of gas turbines, is seen as the purest play in this group. The stock trades around $29, and the company earned $3.02 a share last year, but many analysts expect earnings to grow to about $4.50 by 1990.</p>
        <p>General Electric and Westinghouse Electric should also show substantial increases in turbine sales, but they represent a far smaller part of the two companies' total business.</p>
        <p>Manufacturers of scrubbers are also expected to post improved profits as utilities move to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions.</p>
        <p>Wheelabrator, G.E., Babcock &amp; Wilcox and Air and Water Technologies are among the issues that Mr. Kurland expects to show substantial advances. Combustion Engineering Inc., which has developed some well-received methods for acid rain reduction, is also expected to post gains from the scrubber business. Some forecasts show the company doubling its operating income of $90 million on $1.7 billion in revenues in the next three years.</p>
        <p>Stocks of gas-producing companies are also expected to do well because gas is regarded as the cleanest-burning fuel. Analysts expect that the greatest gains will come in pipeline companies serving areas that have the highest concentrations of coal-fired electric utilities. Among these areas are Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana, and some companies that might benefit are Panhandle Eastern, Columbia Gas, Consolidated Natural Gas and Coastal.</p>
        <p>Mabon, Nugent's report said, ''Gas pipeline companies can also be viewed as plays for meeting regional electric generation shortfalls, as natural gas is the preferred fuel for co-generation and independent power.'' The study concluded that over all, ''co-generation and independent power could represent a 5 percent increase in U.S. gas consumption over the next five years.''</p>
        <p>The other big beneficiaries will be producers of low-sulfur coal. And as new techniques and technologies for burning coal increase the attractiveness of low-sulfur coal, companies like Ashland Oil, Kerr-McGee and Pittston are expected to show sizable increases in sales.</p>
        <p>Some analysts warn that investors should be wary of buying some of these stocks in hopes of seeing big gains quickly. After all, the President's proposal has yet to win Congressional approval, and any new regulations will allow manufacturers several years for full compliance.</p>
        <p>''Most of this is years down the road,'' said Michael Hoffman, an analyst with Salomon Brothers. ''It's going to be a long cycle.''</p>
