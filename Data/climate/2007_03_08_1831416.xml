        <p>The public affairs cable network C-Span announced yesterday that it was changing its copyright policy to ''allow noncommercial copying, sharing and posting'' on the Internet of its coverage of events sponsored by Congress or any federal agency, a decision that covers about 50 percent of its material.</p>
        <p>The rules would apply to video in the network's archives from the late 1970s as well as what appears today, and is intended ''to increase the political dialogue,'' C-Span's president and co-chief operating officer, Rob Kennedy, said.</p>
        <p>The change, he said, would allow ''citizen journalists'' like bloggers and collaborative Web sites to link to the material without worry of copyright infringement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennedy said that C-Span would be fairly expansive in what it considers noncommercial -- even use on blogs or Web sites with advertising would qualify. Clips would be required to credit C-Span.</p>
        <p>In the past, the network has treated all video -- except for its coverage of the House and Senate floor proceedings, which are shot with government cameras and thus public domain -- as copyrighted material that had to be licensed.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, the network ordered the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, to remove a clip of its coverage of a House committee hearing on global warming from her blog, the Gavel.</p>
        <p>''This was really a decision based on where we see our mission in the future,'' Mr. Kennedy said of the change. ''We are trying to do the best we can in our position to expand the conduit between the government and the people.''</p>
        <p>Half of what appears on C-Span's three networks would still be covered by copyrights, including events like the White House Correspondents' Dinner, a popular event online last year, because of the scathing roast of President Bush by Stephen Colbert, host of the ''The Colbert Report'' on Comedy Central.</p>
        <p>C-Span ordered YouTube to remove video of the event, an order that showed the network would aggressively protect its copyright.</p>
        <p>Ms. Pelosi's office greeted the news enthusiastically.</p>
        <p>''As a strong advocate for open and transparent government, I am pleased that C-Span is expanding access to its extensive video coverage of federal government activities,'' a statement from her office said.</p>
        <p>''I am committed to ensuring our government is fully accessible and transparent,'' she said. ''This decision, along with our work to Webcast committee hearings, is a solid start.''</p>
