        <p>As White House officials tried for a second day to explain their failure to turn over to investigators long-sought videotapes of President Clinton at 44 coffees with wealthy supporters, they acknowledged that even more tapes of political events and Presidential fund-raisers had surfaced and that they were likely to find still more.</p>
        <p>The latest tapes to be found have not been released and the White House declined to describe their contents until they could be fully reviewed. But the disclosures placed the Clinton Administration once again in the full damage-control mode that has characterized much of this Presidency.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton hoped to devote the day to sounding an alarm over global warming and wielding the line-item veto on unwanted military construction projects. Instead he and his aides spent hours defensively answering questions, saying that the delay in delivering the tapes was not the result of corruption but of incompetence, overwork and missed messages because of Rosh ha-Shanah, the Jewish New Year.</p>
        <p>At a photo session this afternoon, President Clinton said that the tapes were not deliberately withheld from Congressional and Justice Department investigators, who had subpoenaed, as far back as January, all records about the Democrats' fund-raising in last year's election.</p>
        <p>''I think it was just an accident,'' the President said of the lapse, in a brief exchange with reporters at an unrelated event.</p>
        <p>The existence of the videotapes, which were made by archivists who record the Presidency, stunned and angered people on all sides of the campaign finance investigations.</p>
        <p>Republicans furiously denounced the White House, saying delayed production of the tapes not only was evidence that Democrats were obstructing Congressional investigations, but was a further erosion of confidence in the investigations by Attorney General Janet Reno.</p>
        <p>In fact, as Ms. Reno faced formal deadlines last week to decide whether to expand inquiries into fund-raising by President Clinton and Vice President Gore, Charles F. C. Ruff, the White House counsel, had not disclosed the tapes' existence to Ms. Reno, White House officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ruff, in a weekly White House meeting on Thursday, with Ms. Reno and Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder, adhered to his regular practice of not discussing investigations, said Lanny J. Davis, the White House special counsel. Before the meeting, Mr. Ruff had learned of the tapes, according to the White House. But one of Mr. Ruff's subordinates alerted the Justice Department on Saturday, a day after Ms. Reno issued a letter exonerating Mr. Clinton of any wrongdoing in the coffees.</p>
        <p>Although Justice Department officials said today that the videotapes released so far recorded no illegal actions, the tapes do provide a rare glimpse of the intimate access given to the Democrats' largest donors.</p>
        <p>The furor comes as Republicans and Democrats in the Senate jockey for position before the first vote on Tuesday on campaign finance reform. The same day, the Senate investigating committee is to hear testimony from Harold Ickes, who helped to direct the White House fund-raising operation.</p>
        <p>Republicans on Capitol Hill immediately challenged the White House account of the delayed production of the tapes. They called the delay further evidence of the Administration's effort to obstruct a Congressional fund-raising inquiry, contending that the White House has repeatedly withheld information and then provided it only piecemeal.</p>
        <p>Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate committee investigating campaign-finance abuses, said that the belated release of the tapes was a sign of a ''meltdown'' at the Justice Department, whose officials also were said to be incensed by the disclosure that such tapes existed. Indeed, one senior Justice Department official, who insisted on anonymity, said today that even top Justice officials ''had made their displeasure known at the highest levels.''</p>
        <p>Republicans also said the tapes were further evidence that Attorney General Janet Reno should not have denied their request for a new independent counsel and they threatened to summon her before the Senate Judiciary Committee to account for her agency's handling of campaign-finance irregularities.</p>
        <p>The tapes -- video snippets from 44 coffees with donors and other supporters at the White House -- present an unusual insight into the normally closed world of what Democratic officials have called ''donor servicing'' in an election year.</p>
        <p>At one of the coffees, Donald L. Fowler, the Democratic Party's national chairman, is heard refusing an offer of five checks from an unidentified donor as the President chatted about golf with another guest.</p>
        <p>At another coffee that was videotaped, Mr. Clinton was told by Arief Wiriadinata that he had come to the White House at the suggestion of the Riadys, a prominent Indonesian family and longtime political supporters of the President who are a focus of  criminal and Congressional investigations. Mr. Wiriadinata and his wife, Soraya, contributed $450,000 to the Democratic National Committee. The money was ultimately returned because the couple had failed to file income taxes in 1995.</p>
        <p>The White House also produced the missing audio portion of a tape that shows John Huang, the Democratic fund-raiser, introducing Mr. Clinton to several business executives. The meeting in the White House Map Room on June 18, 1996, includes a number of people involved in trade with China. In one moment of clarity, Mr. Clinton is heard to say to Mr. Huang, ''Hi, John.''</p>
        <p>Administration officials said the first batch of videotapes was discovered Wednesday evening. Both Congress and the Justice Department have been asking for months whether any tapes existed.</p>
        <p>Justice Department officials said the late delivery of the tapes put Ms. Reno in an uncomfortable position. Her senior aides huddled today to decide what response, if any, to make to the new evidence, but no decision was made.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis, the special White House counsel, said that the Senate investigating committee was told about the tapes on Thursday. He said that attempts to inform Justice Department officials were delayed until Friday because of Rosh ha-Shanah.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis added that White House efforts to contact the Justice Department did not succeed until Saturday because of a series of missed telephone messages.</p>
        <p>White House lawyers said that the counsel's office, which is responsible for responding to all subpoena requests, failed to obtain the videotapes because of a miscommunication with the small White House unit that produced them.</p>
        <p>''There is absolutely no basis for saying this was a deliberate effort to impede an investigation,'' Mr. Davis said. ''This was an honest, good-faith error.''</p>
        <p>He insisted that the delay in their delivery to the Justice Department on Saturday was unrelated to the exculpatory report given to Congress by Ms. Reno on Mr. Clinton's role in 1996 campaign fund-raising on Friday.</p>
        <p>''We did not believe the tapes had any impact'' on the Justice Department investigation, Mr. Davis said.</p>
        <p>One White House official who insisted on anonymity said that White House lawyers had been focusing last week on Ms. Reno's decision to expand the inquiry into telephone solicitations made by Vice President Gore.</p>
        <p>The official said that after the lawyers discovered the videotapes, they failed to consider the relationship between the tapes and Ms. Reno's response on Friday to Republican lawmakers who had sought an independent counsel to investigate the President's attendance at the White House coffees.</p>
        <p>The tapes were produced by the White House Communications Agency, which records the presidency. Former presidents have also used the agency, which is staffed by military personnel, to keep video and sound recordings of meetings with the President.</p>
        <p>The video clips of the White House coffees last between one and three minutes and include just the beginnings of the events.</p>
        <p>Officials said that the crew was ushered out because their presence at the small, closed events inhibited candid conversation. The officials said that they were unaware of any copies of the tapes being given or sold to donors or used in any political advertising.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said that the communications agency technicians were not responsible for the failure to point out the existence of the tapes.</p>
        <p>''I don't believe for a moment that any of the career military people in W.H.C.A. would in any way deliberately -- didn't say anything about this,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''And all I can tell you is that, as soon as I found out about it late last week, I said, 'Get this out and let's go on.' And you can view the tapes and draw your own conclusions.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Clinton's words failed to soothe Republicans in Congress, who saw a pattern of delay and defiance in the White House's actions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson said that his committee investigators had repeatedly asked, since April, for any recordings made of the coffees. As recently as the first week of September, Michael Imbroscio, a lawyer from the White House counsel's office, had told investigators that there were no recordings.</p>
        <p>''No question this is a part of an effort to delay and obstruct the investigation,'' Mr. Thompson said at a press conference today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson said the Governmental Affairs Committee would be issuing subpoenas and deposing witnesses who knew or should have known about the taping.</p>
        <p>Another member of the committee, Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, sent a letter to Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, urging the panel to call Ms. Reno to testify about her department's handling of potential campaign-finance abuses.</p>
        <p>Senator Thompson said it was ''a serious mistake for the Senate to impose a cutoff date'' of Dec. 31 on the committee's investigation, because that had allowed the White House to ''play a waiting game.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Mr. Thompson said he would be ''surprised'' if anything incriminating resulted from the tapes released by the White House.  ''I have no confidence in anything they turn over,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''They thwarted our subpoenas, misinformed us and misled us,'' said Senator Thompson. ''The defense of incompetence is wearing a little thin.''</p>
        <p>Senator Thompson also criticized the Justice Department for its inquiry into the matter.</p>
        <p>''What we're experiencing is a departmental meltdown at the Justice Department,'' Senator Thompson said.</p>
        <p>When asked whether he would favor impeachment proceedings against Ms. Reno, Mr. Thompson declined to comment, but did say, ''The more we criticize her, the more she's going to dig in her heels.''</p>
        <p>Senator Thompson said he was ''satisfied'' that Ms. Reno did not know about the videotapes when she completed a preliminary review last Friday.</p>
        <p>When asked today if President Clinton was lying when he said he was unaware of the tapes, Mr. Thompson said, ''I don't know what the President knew and when he knew it.''</p>
        <p>But the Senator said Administration aides ''had been led by the hand right into the middle of the evidence, and still didn't see it.''</p>
        <p>A White House official essentially agreed with Mr. Thompson's assessment, blaming the latest political and public-relations disaster on the constant chaos that engulfs the Clinton White House.</p>
        <p>''You can quote a White House official as sighing,'' the official said with a sigh.</p>
