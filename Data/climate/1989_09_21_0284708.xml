        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Representative Bill Green's appeal for unmanned planetary exploration (''Earth to NASA,'' Op-Ed, Aug. 27) strikes a resonant chord among scientists who are exasperated by the continuing political emphasis on planting American footprints wherever possible. His last few words, referring to the Magellan spacecraft approaching Venus, are especially compelling: ''the space agency can help Earth from turning into that sultry planet's environmental twin.''</p>
        <p>Is it indeed probable that the Magellan project has social as well as scientific significance? Some of the properties of Venus are surely bizarre when compared with ours. There are no seasons on Venus: its axis has no tilt. And its rotation is slow and retrograde: the sun rises in the west and sets about four months later. Most mysterious of all is an unexplained linkage with our planet. Every time Venus makes its closest approach, the same spot on its equator points toward Earth! And since it is moving faster and rotating backward, our beautiful blue ball (seen the way we see Mars in conjunction) stays near the zenith for a very long time as the most conspicuous object in the nighttime sky, since Venus has no moon.</p>
        <p>Then there is the inhospitable atmosphere of Venus: 96 percent carbon dioxide, three percent nitrogen and traces of other gases, mainly sulfur dioxide. Oxygen is virtually absent.</p>
        <p>According to the received view of planetary physicists, the atmosphere of Venus is normal for a terrestrial planet, the natural result of primordial volcanic outgassing, with carbon dioxide as the major gas, followed in importance by water vapor and nitrogen. Thus we believe that Earth's atmosphere began with such a mixture, but that water vapor condensed to form the seas, which in turn dissolved the carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>As things stand, all but a few percent of our carbon is locked up in oceanic carbonate rocks, such as limestone. As we would expect from that model, a release of the entire inventory in the form of carbon dioxide would take us back to the ''sultry'' atmosphere we observe on Venus.</p>
        <p>But why didn't Venus proceed to the same secondary stage, with oceans, oxygen and life? The planet is closer to the sun and so receives solar energy at a higher rate. It is therefore reasonable to believe Venus was too hot for water vapor to condense into liquid. But suppose the Magellan pictures tell us, as in the case of Mars, that there once was significant water on Venus. In that event, life may once have been supportable in a benign atmosphere such as ours. After life's disappearance, the planet would have slowly reverted to what we see as a tertiary or postbiological stage.</p>
        <p>There is little doubt among responsible scientists that our planet is curving rapidly toward its tertiary stage, with carbon dioxide so prominent that life will disappear. We are burning all the carbon we can find, including the vegetation that would have absorbed it. The result is an increase of carbon dioxide at the rate of a few percent per decade, and the rate is likely to increase as the greenhouse effect and the rain of sulfuric acid take their biological toll.</p>
        <p>The question of survival is ours, and ours alone, to decide. But perhaps we are not entirely alone. Whether the rise and fall of early life on Venus is fantasy or fact, the more we learn about its history the more surely we will be able to foresee and control our own. Venus stands in the sky as a close neighbor waiting to tell a story buried under a white shroud of the same acid that is beginning to etch out our delicate green surface. And we can only read the story with instruments.</p>
        <p>For all their courage, none of our astronauts will ever take his or her small step onto Venus, but giant scientific steps await us, to be taken by the marvelous instrumental techniques that extend our exploratory senses to the very ends of space and time.
