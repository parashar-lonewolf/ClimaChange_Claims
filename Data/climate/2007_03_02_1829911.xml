        <p>In the last few weeks, Rudolph W. Giuliani surveyed tractors in rural California, Senator Barack Obama delivered his hope speech to enthusiastic Angelenos and Senator John McCain made earnest remarks about global warming while standing at the side of California's governor.</p>
        <p>While the 2008 presidential campaign is well under way in traditional bellwether states, candidates are also making an early and furious run at voters in this delegate-rich but, in past primary seasons, generally irrelevant state.</p>
        <p>As lawmakers prepare to move the state's presidential primary to Feb. 5 from June, campaigning here has taken an uncharacteristic urgency, with presidential aspirants from both parties jockeying to make an impression on Californians beyond the state's big donors who have long been a financial mainstay of presidential campaigns.</p>
        <p>On Friday, John Edwards is to meet with farm workers in Fresno. On Saturday, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is to appear with the mayor of Los Angeles. And next week, Mr. Giuliani plans another campaign swing.</p>
        <p>''The fact that Barack Obama did a large-scale rally in Los Angeles already speaks to the change in the role California has,'' said Mr. Obama's press secretary, Dan Pfeiffer, who worked for Al Gore's presidential campaign in 2000. ''California has always played an important role, but this time it will be the voters as much, if not more, than the donors who will matter.''</p>
        <p>California will be joining a bevy of other states slated to hold primaries or caucuses on Feb. 5, turning that day into a national primary of sorts and complicating the political calculus for candidates.</p>
        <p>Just how big a role California ends up playing in picking the winners of the Republican and Democratic primaries will probably be shaped by finances and the results from the first primaries and caucuses, in January. The enormous cost of doing business in the state, the country's most populous, will lead some candidates to put their money into places like Arizona, New Mexico and other states with a February primary.</p>
        <p>Still, political analysts and strategists from both parties say, California has the potential to alter the dynamics of the primary season in ways that could resonate in the general election. The state's sheer size, its method for apportioning Republican delegates and its large media market could combine to give Californians a voice they have not enjoyed in a generation.</p>
        <p>''California could play a huge role,'' said Matt David, a spokesman for the campaign of Mr. McCain, a Republican. ''With that number of delegates, things could be decided on one day. Californians can expect to see a lot of Senator McCain this primary season.''</p>
        <p>For Democrats, a big victory in California would probably cement the place of a front-runner, no matter his or her showing in other early primary states, some party officials say.</p>
        <p>Bob Mulholland, a state Democratic Party official, said the party had been getting calls from the presidential campaigns seeking speaking roles at its state convention next month. ''If our primary was in June of 2008,'' Mr. Mulholland said, ''I would bet the candidates would be in Iowa or New Hampshire or Nevada the last weekend of April 2007.''</p>
        <p>The most interesting effect may be on Republicans. The state's Republican Party apportions the entire three-delegate pot from each of the state's 53 Congressional districts to the biggest vote getter in the district. The Democratic Party gives any candidate who gets over 15 percent of the vote in a district at least one delegate.</p>
        <p>As such, a nimble Republican who focuses all of his attention in a few crucial districts has the opportunity to pick up a fair number of delegates. ''We can put California into play,'' said Patrick Dorinson, a spokesman for the state's Republican Party.</p>
        <p>The new interest in California thrills local officials. Many have long wished for candidates to spend a fraction of what they take out of the state in campaign donations to woo California voters and talk about issues like water, economic growth.</p>
        <p>It may also turn Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger -- a Republican who is barred from running for president because he is a naturalized citizen -- into an influential player in the Republican scramble for votes.</p>
        <p>''Governor Schwarzenegger is tired of candidates using California like their rich uncle, looking for handouts without any expectation,'' said Adam Mendelsohn, the governor's communications director.</p>
        <p>In a poll taken in mid-January by the American Research Group, Mr. Giuliani held the lead among Republican voters in the state with 33 percent, followed by Newt Gingrich, the former congressman, and Mr. McCain, with 19 percent and 18 percent, respectively. Among Democrats, Mrs. Clinton was favored by 36 percent of those polled, followed by Mr. Obama with 33 percent. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.</p>
        <p>California officials have long tried to figure out how to make the state relevant to the presidential nominating process. But the change in the primary schedule, expected to be approved by the state's Legislature next week, stems in large part from a separate agenda: the desire of some Democratic lawmakers to hold on to their jobs.</p>
        <p>The Assembly speaker, Fabian Núñez, and the Senate president pro tem, Don Perata, both Democrats, are seeking to alter the state's term limit laws with an initiative that would appear on the new February primary ballot. The measure, if passed, would allow the legislators to run again in June for seats they are now set to give up because of term limits.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwarzenegger, who has said he would sign a measure moving the primary to February, has also nominally agreed to get behind the ballot initiative. But in return, he wants legislators to back his proposal to create a commission to develop plans to redraw legislative district lines, a subject of fierce debate and a failed ballot initiative in 2005.</p>
        <p>Leaders and consultants from both parties said that, on balance, the new attention for California was good for the state.</p>
        <p>''It is important to have candidates who actually come and compete in California,'' said Jim Brulte, a former state senator and Republican leader. ''When you come and campaign in California, you learn about California. And when you learn about California, that makes you a better president for California.''</p>
