        <p>LEAD: The ozone shield over Antarctica dwindled this month to the lowest level observed since measurements began more than a decade ago, researchers reported today.</p>
        <p>The ozone shield over Antarctica dwindled this month to the lowest level observed since measurements began more than a decade ago, researchers reported today.</p>
        <p>Preliminary findings indicate that both man-made chemicals and the extreme South Polar meteorological conditions are responsible for the depletion, said the scientists, whose Antarctic expedition was financed by Federal and private groups.</p>
        <p>The shield protects the earth's surface from harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun that can cause skin cancer and other health problems in humans. Ozone Hole Alarms Scientists</p>
        <p>Already concerned that the buildup of certain chemicals would thin the ozone layer worldwide, scientists were alarmed by the recent discovery of a drastic seasonal depletion of ozone in Antarctica.</p>
        <p>The depletion occurs each year in the Antarctic springtime. Between mid-August and mid-September this year, the expedition found, the ozone at an altitude of 11 miles had been reduced by 50 percent. Last year the ozone level had been reduced by 40 percent.</p>
        <p>Leaders of the expedition cautioned, however, that because the causes of the Antarctic ozone hole are still not fully understood, it would be premature to draw any global conclusions based the expedition's findings.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, when leaders of dozens of nations agreed at meeting in Montreal to freeze and later reduce use of chlorofluorocarbons, industrial chemicals that destroy ozone in the upper atmosphere, rcthey left open the possibility that additional action might be taken if new information suggested that the problem was more severe than thought. But the leaders of the expedition cautioned today against any such conclusions at this time. Need for More Study</p>
        <p>Robert Watson, the chief scientist for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's ozone project, said the data collected by the expedition were inadequate ''for national or international policy making.'' The expedition was financed by NASA, the National Science Foundation and the Chemical Manufacturers Association.</p>
        <p>At a news conference at NASA'S Goddard Space Flight Center here, Dr. Watson and Dr. Dan Albritton of the atmospheric agency said that more time and more research, including an intensive study of what is happening to the ozone layer in the temperate latitudes, was required before the implications of this expedition's findings were clearly understood.</p>
        <p>Information collected by the expedition, which was gathered by two aircraft flying a series of missions with monitoring equipment over the Antarctic continent, did strongly support the view that chlorofluorocarbons were a key factor in the destruction of atmospheric ozone.</p>
        <p>F. Sherwood Rowland, a scientist at the University of California who in the early 1970's first proposed the theory that the man-made chemicals could destroy the the ozone layer, said in an interview today that a ''key'' finding of the Antarctic expedition was that there were high levels of active chlorine in the Antarctic atmosphere.</p>
        <p>''This confirms with lots of details that chlorine is very much involved,'' Dr. Rowland said.  Data End a Debate A statement read by Dr. Watson said that ''there is no longer debate'' as to whether there is chlorine in the ''perturbed region'' at ''abundances sufficient to destroy ozone if our current understanding of the chlorine-ozone catalytic cycle is correct.''</p>
        <p>Chlorofluorcarbons, widely used in refrigerants, foams, aerosols, packaging and other products, are also believed to be contributing to the warming of the earth's atmosphere by the buildup of gases that keep the sun's heat from escaping back into space.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Albritton said the extreme cold of Antarctica, which is the coldest place on earth, seemed to be ''moving at fast forward'' changes that were occurring far more slowly elsewhere around the earth.</p>
        <p>Dr. Watson said the researchers believed that chlorofluorocarbons ''are having a role in the destruction of ozone at all latitudes.'' He added that in temperate zones the destruction seemed to take place at high latitudes, largely from about 15 to 18 miles from the earth's surface, while in the Antarctic the destruction could take place at an altitude of 9 to 12 miles.</p>
        <p>The expedition found that the rapid and extensive depletion of the ozone was almost entirely limited to the atmosphere over the Antarctic Continent itself. The expedition found that the loss of ozone was occurring so rapidly, once falling by 10 percent in a single day in one area, that the depletion could not be explained solely by a chemical reaction. For that reason, the researchers said, it also had to reflect a meteorological change, such as rapid temperature change or an influx of air from another region.</p>
        <p>The explanation offered for the appearance of the ozone hole in the Antartic springtime was that as the sun appeared after the dark Antarctic winter, the chlorine adhering to ice crystals in the atmosphere was converted by the sunlight from passive to active molecules that then reacted with and destroyed the ozone. Dr. Albritton noted that the South Pole is colder than the North Pole and that the air there does not circulate as much.</p>
        <p>The expedition found that the low temperatures and low water content of the Antarctic air reduced the levels of nitrogen in air. Nitrogen oxides tend to bind with chlorine and make it less destructive to the ozone; therefore, the less nitrogen there is, the more active is the chlorine in the air.</p>
        <p>Dr. Watson said there was now twice as much chlorine in the Antarctic atmosphere as there was in 1975, when measurements were first taken.</p>
        <p>Dr. Albritton noted that because chlorofluorocarbons stay in the air up to 250 years, they tended to be distributed evenly through the atmosphere. This means that levels of chlorine are no higher in the Antarctic atmosphere than they are over other regions of the globe.</p>
        <p>In some areas of the Antarctic, the chlorine levels reached as high as one part per billion in the atmosphere, levels that indicted an accumulation of chlorinated chemicals over the years.</p>
        <p>Some environmentalists said the results would indeed have an impact on policy.</p>
        <p>Rafe Pomerance, senior associate of the World Resources Institute, a private policy and research group, said, ''The results are so dramatic, particularly the findings of very high levels of CFC's, that it will increase pressure on all fronts, including pressures to ratify the Montreal protocol for the protection of the ozone layer, more research and faster reductions of CFC's.'' .</p>
        <p>Dr. Rowland, meanwhile, said that the results of this expedition make it clear that ''the agreement in Montreal is only a good first step. We need to go further,'' he said, by reducing the consumption of CFC's by 90 percent.</p>
