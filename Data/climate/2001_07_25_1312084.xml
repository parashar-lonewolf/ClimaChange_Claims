        <p>ALBANY, July 24  The state violated the law by failing to conduct environmental impact studies of the mini-power plants that it has installed around New York City, an appellate court has ruled.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The state violated the law by failing to conduct environmental impact studies of the minipower plants that it has installed around New York City, an appellate court has ruled.</p>
        <p>But the court, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, refused to block operation of the plants, part of the Pataki administration's efforts to bolster the region's power supply. The court gave the New York Power Authority, the state agency that built the plants, until Jan. 31 to complete environmental impact studies, allowing the plants to run at least until then.</p>
        <p>The Power Authority set out last fall to install the plants, six in New York City and one in Suffolk County,  by June, and insisted all along that it did not have to conduct detailed environmental studies that would have assessed any environmental or health effects from all aspects, including air emissions and soil deposits. Administration officials also feared that such studies would make it impossible to meet their ambitious timetable for the plants, particularly since the findings of those studies could be challenged in court.</p>
        <p>A coalition of environmental groups, community groups, elected officials and businesses sued to block the plants. In two parallel decisions, dated Monday and delivered to the lawyers today, a four-justice panel of the Appellate Division in Brooklyn ruled unanimously that the state had acted illegally.</p>
        <p>State environmental law ''mandates the preparation of an environmental impact statement when the proposed project may include the potential for at least one significant environmental effect,'' which is ''a relatively low threshold,'' Justice Myriam J. Altman wrote for the court.</p>
        <p>For projects like the power plants, she added, the law ''carries the presumption that it is likely to have a significant adverse impact on the environment.''</p>
        <p>The appellate ruling overturned a lower court decision that had rejected the plaintiffs' claims against all seven plants, and upheld another lower court ruling against one of the  plants, in Long Island City, Queens.</p>
        <p>''While I'm glad that we were found to be correct on the merits and on the law, I'm disappointed that the court saw fit to allow these generators to continue to function,'' said Assemblyman Michael N. Gianaris, Democrat of Queens, one of the plaintiffs. ''Unfortunately, the Power Authority's strategy of ramming this down the community's throat and ignoring the law seems to have paid off in the short term.''</p>
        <p>Calls to the Power Authority and to an authority spokesman's home were not returned.</p>
        <p>Rising demand has begun to strain the region's power system, and completion of major new plants is years away. Last summer, high demand contributed to a sharp rise in the price of electricity, and experts began warning of possible blackouts.</p>
        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki's administration responded with the miniplants, each of which contains one or two natural gas-fired turbines. The seven plants have a combined top output of more than 400 megawatts, equal to a medium-sized power plant, boosting the city's power supply by about 4 percent.</p>
        <p>The miniplants are among the cleanest power generators in the city. But like any plants that burn fossil fuels, with each turbine producing up to 61 tons a year of toxic compounds, soot and chemicals that contribute to smog.</p>
        <p>The Power Authority's own analysis showed that the plants were all put into poor, largely minority neighborhoods. The authority insisted that it had chosen the only practical sites, ones with gas and electric hookups, available property and industrial zoning.</p>
        <p>In ordering the environmental impact studies, the Appellate Division directed the Power Authority to study the plants' output of soot particles as small as 2.5 microns in diameter, and the health effects of those particles.</p>
        <p>Environmental lawyers called that a breakthrough, the first ruling of its kind by a New York court. The state has so far required power-plant builders to look only at soot down to 10 microns in diameter, but many recent studies have shown damaging health effects from smaller particles.</p>
        <p>''This lays down the precedent for all power-plant projects around the state that the government can no longer blindly them without looking at the damaging health effects of small particulate matter,'' said Keri Powell, a staff lawyer at the New York Public Interest Research Group, a plaintiff in the case.</p>
