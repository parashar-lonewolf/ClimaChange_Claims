        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Imagine how differently our society would function if we incorporated Jared Diamond's analyses into our decisions. Perhaps we would no longer be polarized as we worked toward a common goal: our own sustainability.</p>
        <p>We would demand that our government join the rest of the world to address the realities of climate change. We would embrace renewable energy policies rather than fighting wars to control the world's dwindling resources.</p>
        <p>We would protect the middle class from a descent into poverty from declining wages, rising debt, lack of health care, cuts in social programs and risky stock market solutions to Social Security's problems.</p>
        <p>We would create affordable housing and jobs with a future. And our government officials would ensure that citizens, as well as corporations, have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</p>
