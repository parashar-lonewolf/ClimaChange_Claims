        <p>Pakistan, Answering India, Conducts Nuclear Tests  Pakistan responded to India's nuclear tests with underground nuclear tests of its own.

        <p>U.S. Penalizes Pakistan  President Clinton denounced Pakistan's nuclear tests as dangerously destabilizing and imposed penalties that could cost the Islamic nation billions of dollars.</p>

        <p>Pakistan has long depended on the World Bank, and more recently the International Monetary Fund, to prop up a failing banking system and a debt-ridden economy.</p>
        <p>A9</p>
        <p>Japan, Germany, Canada and Australia joined the United States in taking action against Pakistan. France, Russia and Britain condemned the testing but did not back sanctions.</p>
        <p>A10</p>
        <p>China expressed ''deep regret'' over Pakistan's decision to conduct nuclear tests, but denounced India for provoking the crisis.</p>
        <p>A10</p>
        <p>The global network of seismometers that track earthquakes and underground atomic tests detected a lone nuclear signal from Pakistan. The signal could have been from several simultaneous blasts, scientists said, or from a single detonation.</p>

        <p>Russia Asks for Fiscal Support  President Boris N. Yeltsin said he would appeal to Western leaders for a support package to help stabilize Russia's shaky economy.</p>

        <p>Germany Approves Pardon  The German Parliament approved a mass pardon for hundreds of thousands of people punished unjustly by Nazi courts, military tribunals and medical panels. The new law is intended to provide moral rehabilitation for those Germans who fell afoul of the Nazis as resistance fighters, homosexuals or deserters.</p>

        <p>Sentence for Internet Smut  The former head of Compuserve Deutschland was sentenced to two years in jail, with a suspended sentence, on charges of spreading pornography. The judgment was the first time in Germany that an Internet provider had been held legally responsible for images reached through its service.</p>

        <p>Protests Resume in Indonesia  Students demonstrated in Jakarta to demand immediate elections. Their demand was repeated by the Muslim leader Amien Rais, who used the student demonstrations in recent weeks as a platform to consolidate his position as the country's most influential opposition figure.</p>

        <p>Panamanians Oppose 2d Term  The President of Panama is facing widespread opposition to his effort to amend the country's Constitution so he can seek a second five-year term. Whoever wins the election, scheduled for next May, will administer the Panama Canal when the United States yields control of the waterway on Dec. 31, 1999.</p>

        <p>Catalytic Devices Found To Add to Global Warming  The catalytic converter, which has sharply reduced smog from cars, is now a significant and growing cause of global warming, the E.P.A. says. Researchers have long suspected that the converters sometimes rearrange nitrogen-oxygen compounds from exhaust to form nitrous oxide, a powerful greenhouse gas that is more than 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide, the most common of the gases, experts say.</p>

        <p>Image of Putative Planet  Astronomers have reconstructed what they believe to be the first image captured of a planet outside our solar system. The putative planet, estimated to be several times as large as Jupiter, lies 450 light-years from Earth -- comparatively close in astronomical terms.</p>

        <p>3 Arrested in 1966 Killing  The authorities in Mississippi arrested three aging Klansmen and revived chargeds against them in the 1966 killing of Vernon F. Dahmer Sr., one of the state's most revered civil rights leaders.</p>

        <p>Action Urged on Privilege Case  The Whitewater independent counsel asked the Supreme Court to put on a fast track the privilege claims that President Clinton has asserted to block the testimony of two aides in the Lewinsky investigation.</p>
        <p>A14</p>
        <p>Monica S. Lewinsky went to the Federal Building in Los Angeles under subpoena to give investigators her fingerprints and a sample of her handwriting, according of people close to the inquiry. They said the investigators wanted to use this evidence, along with voice samples they may take later, to corroborate information in taped conversations between Ms. Lewinsky and Linda R. Tripp.</p>

        <p>Actor and Wife Are Shot Dead  Phil Hartman, the comedian well known for his roles on ''Saturday Night Live'' and ''Newsradio,'' was shot to death in his home in Los Angeles, apparently by his wife, who then took her own life as officers ushered their two children from the house, the police said.</p>

        <p>Taxi Commission Backs Most of Mayor's Proposals  The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission approved most of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's strict new regulations, including quadrupling insurance requirements, sharply increasing fines for cabbies and making it much easier for them to lose their licenses.</p>

        <p>Tracking H.I.V. in New Jersey  Public health officials say New Jersey offers a textbook case of the value of registers of people with the AIDS virus. The six years it has kept a list of H.I.V. cases hold a valuable lesson for other states: there have been no breaches of confidentiality, other perils that critics warn about have not come to pass, and the benefits have been abundant.</p>

        <p>Disputed Play Is Back in Lineup  A play featuring a gay Jesus-like figure who has sex with his Apostles is back on the fall schedule of the Manhattan Theater Club. The play, ''Corpus Christi'' by Terrence McNally, is to be reinstated despite protests and anonymous bomb threats and after furious accusations from artists that the theater was being intimidated into self-censorship.</p>

        <p>Healthcare to Buy Humana  United Healthcare agreed to buy Humana for $5.5 billion, further shrinking the number of competitors in the industry and narrowing the choices of health plans for consumers. The combination, with more than 10 million members across the country, would dominate the South Florida market and would be the strongest insurer in Chicago and a number of other Midwestern cities.</p>

        <p>Strong First-Quarter Growth  The American economy in the first quarter was even stronger than originally thought. The gross domestic product rose from January through March at a torrid annual rate of 4.8 percent. The first estimate for the quarter, issued last month, had been 4.2 percent. But corporate profits in the first quarter fell by 2.2 percent, after taxes.</p>

        <p>Volatility in Latin America  Economic instability in Russia and East Asia appears to be playing a bigger role in the drop-off in Latin America's stock markets than local economic or political factors.</p>
