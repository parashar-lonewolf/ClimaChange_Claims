        <p>TO John H. Sununu, Chief of Staff to President Bush and the person who is by all accounts the single individual most responsible for the United States's wait-and-see stance on global warming, the question is a straightforward one of economic growth versus an unproven environmental threat.</p>
        <p>And he suggests that the drive to put a cap on carbon dioxide emissions, a byproduct of growth that many scientists fear will cause the earth's climate to warm, is the latest vehicle adopted by a perennial "no-growth" movement whose roots go back at least to the early 1970's.</p>
        <p>The Administration argues that when all heat-trapping atmospheric gases are taken into account, rather than just carbon dioxide by itself, actions already taken by the United States will stabilize its total contribution to the potential for global warming at 1990 levels in the year 2000. But European governments, and virtually all American environmentalists, advocate targets for capping carbon dioxide emissions separately.</p>
        <p>This focus on carbon dioxide alone, Mr. Sununu said in an interview, "increases skepticism that some people are less concerned about climate change and more concerned about establishing an anti-growth policy." Such people "keep finding surrogates for no-growth," he said.</p>
        <p>As Governor of New Hampshire before he became the President's Chief of Staff, Mr. Sununu gained a reputation as favoring economic growth over environmental regulation.</p>
        <p>On global warming, he said that the Administration had "a very strong commitment toward making sure we develop a superior understanding of the reality of global climate change" before making "either national or international decisions that are multi-trillion dollar decisions in terms of impacts on the economy and jobs."</p>
        <p>A particular concern of his, he said, is that the mathematical models that predict global warming are unrealistic and have led to assessments that are "either incomplete or inconclusive." The Administration's basic concern, he said, is that "when we do implement policies they are based on fact rather than perhaps on not-so-solid assumptions."</p>
